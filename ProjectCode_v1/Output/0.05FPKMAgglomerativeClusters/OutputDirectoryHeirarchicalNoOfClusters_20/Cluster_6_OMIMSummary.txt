;;CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 59; C10ORF59
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Renalase is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent amine oxidase that
is secreted into the blood from the kidney (Xu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for transcripts likely to encode proteins
secreted from the kidney, Xu et al. (2005) identified a cDNA clone
encoding renalase. The deduced 342-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 37.8 kD. Renalase contains an N-terminal signal
sequence and an amino oxidase domain. Northern blot analysis of several
tissues detected robust expression of a 1.5-kb transcript in kidney, and
lower expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. A minor
transcript of about 2.4 kb was detected in skeletal muscle, and a minor
transcript of 1.2 kb was detected in kidney and liver. In situ
hybridization detected renalase in renal glomeruli and proximal tubules,
and in cardiomyocytes. Western blot analysis detected renalase at an
apparent molecular mass of about 35 kD in human urine. There was also a
signal at 67 to 75 kD, suggesting that the protein may form a doublet.
Renalase was also detected in the plasma of healthy individuals, but not
in the plasma of patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (2005) demonstrated that epitope-tagged renalase was secreted
from transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Purified and recombinant
renalase metabolized catecholamines, with dopamine as the preferred
substrate, followed by epinephrine and norepinephrine. Within 30 seconds
of a single bolus injection of recombinant renalase into rats, systolic,
diastolic, and mean arterial pressure were decreased in a dose-dependent
manner. Renalase also decreased cardiac contractility and heart rate,
but peripheral vascular resistance was unchanged.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (2005) determined that the renalase gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 311 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Xu et al. (2005) mapped the RNLS gene to
chromosome 10q23.33.

611477	TITLE *611477 RNA POLYMERASE II-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; RPAP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Jeronimo et al. (2007) identified RPAP3 as an RNA polymerase II (see
180660)-associated protein in HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells and
obtained a full-length RPAP3 cDNA by database and sequence analyses. The
deduced 665-amino acid protein contains 2 helix-turn-helix
tetratricopeptide repeats characteristic of chaperone cofactors.

GENE FUNCTION

Using affinity purification, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic
analysis, Jeronimo et al. (2007) mapped an interaction network of
protein complexes involved in the RNA polymerase II machinery. They
found that RPAP1 (611475), RPAP2 (611476), RPAP3, and XAB1 (611479) were
tightly bound to RNA polymerase II in the soluble nuclear compartment in
HEK293 cells, and gel filtration with epitope-tagged POLR2J (604150)
confirmed that RPAP1, RPAP3, and XAB1 cofractionated with RNA polymerase
II. Examination of the protein interaction network revealed that the
RPAPs and XAB1 also interacted with components of the Mediator (e.g.,
MED17; 603810) and Integrator (e.g., INTS3; 611347) complexes, as well
as with proteins able to assemble into molecular chaperone complexes,
including the prefoldins (e.g., PFDN6; 605660) and the AAA+ ATPases
RUVBL1 (603449) and RUVBL2 (604788).

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the RPAP3 gene to chromosome 12q13.11 based on an
alignment of the RPAP3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025561) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

606818	TITLE *606818 DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE III; DPP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DPP3 (EC 3.4.14.4) is one of the dipeptidyl aminopeptidases that remove
N-terminal dipeptides from physiologically active peptides such as
angiotensin (see 106150) or enkephalin (131330).

CLONING

Fukasawa et al. (1999) isolated a partial DPP3 cDNA clone from a
placenta cDNA library, using antibody to the purified protein as probe.
By mass spectrometry, Abramic et al. (2000) determined that the
molecular mass of full-length DPP3 is 82.5 kD; by SDS-PAGE, the apparent
molecular mass is 81.2 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation and enzyme analysis of the rat recombinant DPP3 protein,
Fukasawa et al. (1999) found that DPP3 shows zinc-dependent
metalloprotease activity and contains a conserved HELLGH motif with
similarity to the zincin HExxH consensus motif. Abramic et al. (2000)
noted that whereas the enzymes purified from rat and human erythrocytes
show the same molecular mass, pI, and enzyme substrates, they differ
significantly in their temperature stability, pH optima, kinetic
parameters, and sensitivity to divalent cations, sulfhydryl reagents,
and microbial protease inhibitors.

MAPPING

Fukasawa et al. (2000) mapped the DPP3 gene to chromosome 11q12-q13.1 by
FISH.

607560	TITLE *607560 RHO GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 2; ARHGEF2
;;GEFH1;;
KIAA0651
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Rho (see RhoA; 165390)-related small GTPases are involved in regulating
signal transduction cascades from extracellular stimuli to the cell
nucleus and cytoskeleton. DBL (311030)-like guanine nucleotide exchange
factors (GEFs), such as ARHGEF2, catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for
GTP on Rho-related proteins.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned ARHGEF2, which they designated
KIAA0651. The deduced protein contains 910 amino acids. RT-PCR detected
expression of ARHGEF2 in all tissues examined.

Reddy et al. (1989) identified a partial clone of ARHGEF2 as a regulator
of proliferation in Hep-2 cells. By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library
with this clone, followed by 5-prime RACE, Ren et al. (1998) obtained a
full-length cDNA encoding ARHGEF2, which they designated GEFH1. The
deduced protein contains 894 amino acids and has a calculated molecular
mass of 100 kD. ARHGEF2 has an N-terminal zinc finger-like motif,
followed by a DBL homology domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a
C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb
transcript in all tissues tested, with highest expression in thymus,
testis, and leukocytes.

Krendel et al. (2002) determined that the full-length ARHGEF2 protein
contains 985 amino acids. They concluded that KIAA0651 likely represents
a splice variant that differs from the full-length sequence by the
absence of the N-terminal zinc finger motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Ren et al. (1998) determined that recombinant GEFH1 could stimulate the
dissociation of radiolabeled GDP from RhoA. By screening a panel of
small G proteins, they found that GEFH1 was a GEF for RhoA, RhoB
(165370), RhoC (165380), and RAC1 (602048). Further characterization
revealed that GEFH1 bound Rho and Rac when these G proteins were in
either the GDP- or GTP-bound state. GEFH1 transfected into COS-7 or NIH
3T3 cells showed a filamentous distribution that colocalized with
tubulin (see 191130). Mutation of the C-terminal coiled-coil region
caused redistribution of GEFH1 to a cytoplasmic punctate distribution.
Overexpression of GEFH1 in COS-7 cells resulted in induction of large
membrane ruffles, similar to the effect observed when a constitutively
active form of Rac was expressed.

Krendel et al. (2002) determined that KIAA0651, a splice variant of
GEFH1 lacking the N-terminal zinc finger motif, did not localize to
microtubules. The full-length protein containing a point mutation (cys53
to arg) in the zinc finger, as well as N- and C-terminally truncated
GEFH1 proteins, also lost microtubule localization. However, none of
these variants affected microtubule stability. These variants did,
however, show higher GEF activity than the microtubule-bound forms, and
they induced Rho-dependent changes in cell morphology and actin
organization. Krendel et al. (2002) concluded that both the N- and
C-terminal motifs mediate microtubule localization of GEFH1, and that
GEFH1 links changes in microtubule integrity to Rho-dependent regulation
of the actin cytoskeleton.

Zenke et al. (2004) identified a region in the C terminus of GEFH1 that
is important for the suppression of its guanine nucleotide exchange
activity by microtubules. This region has a coiled-coil motif, a
proline-rich motif that may interact with SH3 domain-containing
proteins, and a potential binding site for 14-3-3 proteins (see YWHAH;
113508). Zenke et al. (2004) also showed that ser885 within the
14-3-3-binding site is a phosphorylation site for PAK1 (602590), an
effector of RAC and CDC42 (116952) GTPases. PAK1 phosphorylation of
GEFH1 at ser885 induced the docking of 14-3-3 to GEFH1 and the
relocation of 14-3-3 to microtubules. Zenke et al. (2004) concluded that
PAK and 14-3-3 are involved in the regulation of GEFH1 activity and that
phosphorylation of GEFH1 by PAK may coordinate RAC/CDC42- and
Rho-dependent signaling pathways.

RhoA is downregulated when epithelial cells reach confluence, resulting
in inhibition of signaling pathways that stimulate proliferation. By
coimmunoprecipitation, Aijaz et al. (2005) found that endogenous Gefh1
interacted with cingulin, a tight junction adaptor protein, in
Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Cingulin binding inhibited RhoA
activation and signaling, suggesting that the increase in cingulin
expression in confluent cells inhibits Gefh1 and thereby downregulates
RhoA. In agreement, RNA interference of Gefh1 or transfection of a
mutant Gefh1 unable to bind cingulin inhibited G1/S phase transition in
MDCK cells. Depletion of cingulin by regulated RNA interference resulted
in RhoA activation and the development of irregular cell monolayers.
Aijaz et al. (2005) concluded that the formation of epithelial tight
junctions contributes to the downregulation of RhoA by inactivating
Gefh1 in a cingulin-dependent manner.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the ARHGEF2
gene to chromosome 1.

602940	TITLE *602940 MARCKS-LIKE PROTEIN 1; MARCKSL1
;;MLP;;
MARCKS-RELATED PROTEIN; MRP;;
MAC-MARCKS;;
F52
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Umekage and Kato (1991) identified a cDNA with homology to MARCKS
(PKCSL; 177061) among mouse brain cDNAs with specific brain expression
patterns. The myristoylated, alanine-rich protein MARCKS is a widely
expressed, prominent substrate for protein kinase C (see 176960), a key
enzyme of intracellular signal transduction. The predicted 200-amino
acid protein, which they called F52, shares 52% amino acid identity with
bovine MARCKS. The similarity between the 2 proteins is found in the
consensus myristoylation sequence near the N-terminus and in the
25-amino acid protein kinase C phosphorylation site domain. F52 has a
similar amino acid composition to MARCKS, although its alanine content
is not as high. It is distributed throughout the mouse brain in a
pattern that is distinct from that of MARCKS.

By screening a genomic library with portions of the Mrp cDNA, Stumpo et
al. (1998) isolated the human homolog, which they designated MLP for
'MARCKS-like protein.' They reported that the sequences of the mouse and
human promoters were 71% identical over 433 bp. A transgene containing
this 433-bp fragment from mouse linked to a reporter Mrp
beta-galactosidase gene produced normal patterns of Mrp expression in
the developing mouse embryo.

Using Northern hybridization, Lobach et al. (1993) observed Mrp
expression in various mouse tissues, with highest levels in testis and
uterus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lobach et al. (1993) reported that the mouse F52, or Mrp, gene contains
a single intron at a position exactly analogous to that of the single
intron in mouse, cow, and human MARCKS.

MAPPING

By analysis of an interspecific backcross, Lobach et al. (1993) mapped
the Mrp gene to a position on mouse chromosome 4 that was closely linked
to the Lck (153390) locus. Based on homology of synteny, they predicted
that the human homolog would map to chromosome 1p35-p32. Using somatic
cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Stumpo et
al. (1998) confirmed that the human MLP gene maps to 1p34.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wu et al. (1996) used gene targeting to generate Mrp-deficient mice.
They observed severe neural tube defects (NTD) including exencephaly,
spina bifida, and tail flexion anomaly in approximately 60% of the
homozygous mutants and in approximately 10% of heterozygous animals. The
homozygous mutants without exencephaly survived despite brain
abnormalities, which appear to occur secondarily to the NTD. Wu et al.
(1996) suggested that mutations in Mrp result in isolated NTD and
therefore may provide an animal model for common human NTD.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ATG14, which they designated
KIAA0831. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in both
its 3- and 5-prime ends, and the deduced protein contains 379 amino
acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest ATG14 expression in brain, lower
expression in kidney and ovary, and little to no expression in other
human tissues examined.

Using mass spectrometry to identify proteins that immunoprecipitated
with beclin-1 (BECN1; 604378) from a human breast epithelial cell line,
followed by database analysis and RT-PCR of human embryonic kidney
cells, Matsunaga et al. (2009) cloned ATG14, which they called ATG14L.
The deduced 492-amino acid protein contains 3 coiled-coil domains in its
N-terminal half. Database analysis revealed close orthologs in
vertebrates only. Immunofluorescence analysis and immunoelectron
microscopy showed that ATG14L localized to autophagosomes, isolation
membranes of forming autophagosomes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and a
punctate structure. ATG14L had an apparent molecular mass of 55.3 kD by
SDS-PAGE.

Zhong et al. (2009) cloned mouse Atg14. The deduced 492-amino acid
protein has a conserved structural maintenance of chromosomes motif that
includes 2 coiled-coil domains. Western blot analysis showed that Atg14
had an apparent molecular mass of about 60 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using epitope-tagged human beclin-1 for affinity purification, followed
by mass spectroscopy, Matsunaga et al. (2009) showed that beclin-1
interacted with ATG14L, UVRAG (602493), Rubicon (KIAA0226; 613516),
VPS34 (PIK3C3; 602609), and VPS15 (PIK3R4; 602610) in MCF7 breast cancer
cells. Using antibodies directed to individual proteins, they found that
beclin-1, VPS34, and VPS15 were present within 3 distinct complexes: a
complex containing ATG14L, a complex containing UVRAG, and a complex
containing both UVRAG and Rubicon. Yeast 2-hybrid and deletion analyses
revealed that the coiled-coil regions of ATG14L and UVRAG interacted
directly with the coiled-coil region of beclin-1 in a mutually exclusive
manner. Knockdown of ATG14L via short hairpin RNA interfered with
starvation-induced formation of autophagosomes in human A549 lung
epithelia cells. Knockout of Atg14l in mouse embryonic stem cells
resulted in defective basal autophagy and starvation-induced autophagy.
Matsunaga et al. (2009) concluded that ATG14L is essential for the
initiation of autophagosome formation.

Zhong et al. (2009) found that mouse Atg14 coimmunoprecipitated with
endogenous beclin-1 and Vps34, which are essential components of a
protein complex that regulates autophagy. Mutation analysis revealed
that both coiled-coil domains of Atg14 were required for the interaction
of Atg14 with beclin-1 and Vps34. Gel filtration experiments revealed
that endogenous Vps34, beclin-1, Atg14, and Rubicon coeluted in a
complex of over 700 kD. However, immunoprecipitation analysis showed
that Atg14 and Rubicon did not always coimmunoprecipitate in the same
complex. Knockdown of Atg14 or beclin-1 via small interfering RNA
impaired autophagy-mediated clearance of a test substrate. Knockdown of
Atg14 in mouse fibroblasts resulted in accumulation of large puncta
representing ubiquitinated protein inclusions and reduced the number of
autophagosomes. Atg14 also stimulated Vps34 kinase activity, but only
when coexpressed with beclin-1.

Hamasaki et al. (2013) demonstrated that autophagosomes form at the
ER-mitochondria contact site in mammalian cells. Imaging data revealed
that the preautophagosome/autophagosome marker ATG14 relocalizes to the
ER-mitochondria contact site after starvation, and the
autophagosome-formation marker ATG5 (604261) also localizes at the site
until formation is complete. Subcellular fractionation showed that ATG14
cofractionates in the mitochondria-associated ER membrane fraction under
starvation conditions. Disruption of the ER-mitochondria contact site
prevents the formation of ATG14 puncta. The ER-resident SNARE protein
syntaxin-17 (STX17; 604204) binds ATG14 and recruits it to the
ER-mitochondria contact site. Hamasaki et al. (2013) concluded that
their results provided insight into organelle biogenesis by
demonstrating that the ER-mitochondria contact site is important in
autophagosome formation.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the ATG14 gene
to chromosome 14.

;;PDZ-RHOGEF;;
GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER EAAT4-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 48; GTRAP48;;
KIAA0380
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned ARHGEF11, which they designated
KIAA0380. The deduced 1,522-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with mouse Arhgef1 (601855), suggesting it has a role in cell
signaling and communication. RT-PCR detected weak ARHGEF11 expression in
all tissues examined.

Rumenapp et al. (1999) stated that the full-length KIAA0380 protein
contains 1,522 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 168.6
kD. It has an N-terminal PDZ domain, followed by a regulator of G
protein signaling (RGS) homology domain and tandem Dbl (MCF2; 311030)
homology (DH) and pleckstrin (PLEK; 173570) homology (PH) domains.
KIAA0380 also has proline-rich regions in its N- and C-terminal halves.

To identify proteins that interact with the C terminus of the EAAT4
(600637) protein, Jackson et al. (2001) used the last 77 amino acids of
EAAT4 as bait to screen a rat brain cDNA library. Jackson et al. (2001)
isolated 2 independent cDNA clones and called them Gtrap41 (SPTBN2;
604985) and Gtrap48. The largest ORF identified for Gtrap48 encodes a
protein of 1,527 amino acids with a predicted relative molecular mass of
168,698 Da. Gtrap48 shares 90% amino acid identity with human KIAA0380,
as well as significant homology with ARHGEF1. Gtrap48 possesses a PDZ
domain, an RGS sequence, tandem DH and PH domains characteristic of
guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Rho family of G proteins,
and 2 proline-rich sequences. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb
Gtrap48 mRNA in brain tissue. Longer exposure revealed a low level of
expression in liver and kidney. Gtrap48 was expressed predominantly in
rat cerebellum, with low level immunoreactivity in striatum,
hippocampus, and thalamus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transfected human embryonic kidney cells, Rumenapp et al. (1999)
showed that N-terminally truncated forms of KIAA0380 containing the DH
and PH domains bound RhoA (165390) and exhibited guanine nucleotide
exchange factor activity for RhoA. They did not bind or activate RAC1
(602048) or CDC42 (116952). When expressed in a human bladder carcinoma
cell line, N-terminally truncated forms of KIAA0380 containing the DH
and PH domains induced actin stress fiber formation, a cellular response
known to be controlled by RhoA. Expression of the isolated RGS homology
domain of KIAA0380 prevented stress fiber formation induced by the G
protein-coupled lysophosphatidic acid receptor (see LPAR1; 602282).

By immunofluorescence microscopy, Jackson et al. (2001) found that rat
Eaat4, Gtrap41, and Gtrap48 were all expressed in cerebellar Purkinje
cell soma and dendrites, with little axonal staining. Gtrap48 was found
to activate Rho. Expression of Gtrap48 induced reorganization of the
actin cytoskeleton. When Gtrap41 and Gtrap48 were coexpressed, Gtrap41
colocalized with actin in structures that resembled actin stress fibers.
Overexpression of Gtrap48 also induced formation of membrane ruffling
and filopodia. Jackson et al. (2001) measured the sodium-dependent
glutamate transport activity of HEK-Eaat4 cells that had been
transfected with 1 or both of the interacting proteins. Gtrap41 and
Gtrap48 produced respective 2-fold and 4-fold increases in glutamate
transport, and their coexpression resulted in a further increase in
glutamate uptake. Kinetic analysis indicated that Gtrap41 and Gtrap48
produced an increase in the V(max) of glutamate transport activity. The
authors suggested Gtrap41 and Gtrap48 may therefore enhance glutamate
transport either through an increase in the catalytic rate of the
transporter or through an increase in cell surface availability. Gtrap41
and Gtrap48 stabilized Eaat4 at the plasma membrane. The Eaat4/Gtrap48
interaction was important in modulating Eaat4 uptake activity. Jackson
et al. (2001) concluded that, in the modulation of EAAT4 glutamate
transport, their findings implicate a role for G protein signaling, a
pathway that may involve Rho activation, and anchoring to the actin
cytoskeleton. These proteins may also modulate the perisynaptic
distribution of EAAT4 at glutamatergic synapses.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Longhurst et al. (2006) showed that rat
PDZ-RhoGEF interacted with light chain-2 (LC2) of microtubule-associated
protein-1 (MAP1A; 600178), and they confirmed the interaction through
protein pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Mutation analysis
revealed that the carboxylate-binding loop of the PDZ domain of
PDZ-RhoGEF was required for the interaction. PDZ-RhoGEF proteins with
mutations in the carboxylate-binding loop induced changes in cell
morphology and actin organization. These mutants altered the activation
of Rho GTPases, and coexpression of dominant-negative Rho GTPases
prevented the morphologic changes. In cells expressing wildtype rat
PDZ-RhoGEF, drug-induced microtubule depolymerization produced changes
in cell morphology similar to those induced by PDZ-RhoGEF mutants.
Longhurst et al. (2006) concluded that modulation of the guanine
nucleotide exchange activity of PDZ-RhoGEF through interaction with
microtubule-associated protein light chains may coordinate microtubule
integrity and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the
ARGHEF11 gene to chromosome 1.

By sequence similarity between the KIAA0380 sequence and a genomic
contig (GenBank GENBANK NT_004327), Scott (2001) mapped the human
ARHGEF11 gene to chromosome 1q21.

603890	TITLE *603890 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2L 6; UBE2L6
;;UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME UBCH8; UBCH8
DESCRIPTION Ubiquitination of a protein substrate requires the concerted action of 3
classes of enzymes: E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin protein ligases. See
600012. E2 enzymes may transfer ubiquitin either directly to a substrate
or to an E3 protein. Class I E2s are unable to transfer ubiquitin to
proteins in vitro, suggesting that this class of E2s may require an E3
enzyme for substrate recognition. Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay with the
E3 enzyme E6AP (601623) as bait, Kumar et al. (1997) identified cDNAs
encoding a novel class I E2 that they named UBCH8. The predicted
152-amino acid UBCH8 protein is 46% identical to UBCH7 (603721). In
vitro, recombinant Ubch8 formed thiol ester complexes with ubiquitin and
was able to transfer ubiquitin to E6AP. Both UBCH7 and UBCH8
specifically associated with E6AP in yeast 2-hybrid assays, while UBCH5
(602961) and UBCH6 (602916) interacted selectively with an S. cerevisiae
E3, RSP5 (see 602278). In vitro, the E6AP-interacting E2s were also able
to function with E6AP in the ubiquitination of a substrate, whereas
noninteracting E2s were unable to do so. The authors suggested that
selective physical interaction between E2 and E3 enzymes forms the basis
of specificity for functionally distinct E2-E3 combinations.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ardley et al. (2000) mapped the
UBE2L6 gene to chromosome 11q12.

601515	TITLE *601515 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 14; FGF14
;;FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR HOMOLOGOUS FACTOR 4; FHF4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FGF14 belongs to a subclass of fibroblast growth factors that are
expressed in the developing and adult central nervous system (Smallwood
et al., 1996). For a discussion on the FGF gene family, see FGF12
(601513).

CLONING

Smallwood et al. (1996) identified and characterized 4 novel members of
the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, including FGF14, which they
called FHF4. The genes were identified by a combination of random cDNA
sequencing, database searches, and degenerate PCR.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2000) characterized 2 mouse isoforms of Fgf14, which they
called Fgf14-1a and Fgf14-1b, resulting from alternative first exons. In
situ hybridization showed that Fgf14 is widely expressed in mouse brain,
spinal cord, major arteries, and thymus between embryonic days 12.5 and
14.5. In mouse cerebellar development, Fgf14 was first observed at
postnatal day 1 in postmitotic granule cells and later in migrating and
postmigratory granule cells. The Fgf14 expression pattern in cerebellum
was complementary to that of Math1 (ATOH1; 601461), a marker for
proliferating granule cells in the external germinal layer.

MAPPING

By Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA from rodent/human hybrid
cell lines carrying individual human chromosomes, Smallwood et al.
(1996) mapped the FGF14 gene to chromosome 13. Using an interspecific
backcross mapping panel, they mapped the mouse homolog to chromosome 14,
very close to the Rap2a (179540) gene, which in the human maps to 13q34.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large 3-generation Dutch family with early-onset tremor,
dyskinesia, and slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia (SCA27; 609307),
van Swieten et al. (2003) found a phe145-to-ser mutation in the FGF14
gene (F145S; 601515.0001). The disorder was consistent with the
occurrence of ataxia and paroxysmal dyskinesia in Fgf14 knockout mice
(Wang et al., 2002).

In 1 of 208 unrelated patients with familial ataxia, Dalski et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion in the FGF14 gene
(601515.0002). The patient had early onset of the disorder and mild
mental retardation.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the role of Fgf14 in CNS development and adult brain function,
Wang et al. (2002) generated Fgf14-deficient mice that expressed an
FGF14/beta-galactosidase fusion protein in place of the normal Fgf14
protein. The Fgf14-deficient mice were viable, fertile, and anatomically
normal, but developed ataxia and a paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement
disorder. The authors noted that the motor abnormalities are associated
with dysfunction of the basal ganglia system and resemble several human
dystonia syndromes. Using neuropharmacologic studies, Wang et al. (2002)
showed that the Fgf14-deficient mice had reduced responses to dopamine
agonists. They suggested a function for Fgf14 in neuronal signaling,
axonal trafficking, and synaptosomal function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 27
FGF14, PHE145SER

In affected members of a 3-generation Dutch family with autosomal
dominant spinocerebellar ataxia-27 (609307), van Swieten et al. (2003)
identified a phe145-to-ser (F145S) mutation in the FGF14 gene. As
indicated by protein modeling, the amino acid change was predicted to
reduce the stability of the protein.

.0002
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 27
FGF14, 1-BP DEL, 487A

In a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia-27 (609307), Dalski et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (487delA) in exon 4 of
the FGF14 gene, resulting in premature termination of the protein and
loss of one-third of amino acid residues. The mutation was not
identified in 208 control samples. The patient had early onset of the
disorder and mild mental retardation.

611883	TITLE *611883 BRCA2- AND CDKN1A-INTERACTING PROTEIN; BCCIP
;;p21- AND CDK-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; TOK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the C-terminal half of p21 (CDK1A; 116899) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library, Ono et al. (2000) cloned BCCIP,
which they called TOK1. EST database analysis and PCR of a brain cDNA
library revealed 2 TOK1 variants, TOK1-alpha and -beta. The deduced
proteins contain 322 and 314 amino acids, respectively, and are
identical for the first 259 amino acids. Northern blot analysis using a
probe common to both TOK1 variants detected a major 1.5-kb transcript
and a minor 3-kb transcript. Specific probes detected both TOK1 variants
as 1.5-kb transcripts. TOK1-alpha was highly expressed in skeletal
muscle, with little to no expression in other tissues examined.
TOK1-beta was highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, moderately
expressed in placenta and pancreas, and weakly expressed in brain,
kidney, and liver. Western blot analysis detected TOK1-alpha and
TOK1-beta as 50- and 45-kD proteins, respectively. In synchronized HeLa
cells, expression of TOK1-alpha began after G2/M phase and peaked before
S phase. TOK1-beta was expressed throughout the cell cycle, but like
TOK1-alpha, its expression increased before S phase.

Using an internal conserved region of BRCA2 (600185) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, followed by database analysis, Liu et al. (2001) cloned
BCCIP-alpha and -beta, which correspond to TOK1-alpha and -beta,
respectively. Both BCCIP isoforms have an N-terminal acidic domain and
an evolutionarily conserved internal domain, followed by the C-terminal
variable domain. The internal domain contains a putative calcium-binding
domain. Western blot analysis detected both BCCIP proteins in all
tissues examined. Immunohistochemical analysis of several human cell
lines showed nuclear expression of endogenous BCCIP.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mutation analysis, Ono et al. (2000) found that TOK1-alpha bound
to the C-terminal proximal region of p21. However, TOK1-beta did not
bind p21. TOK1-alpha formed a ternary complex with p21 and an active
form of CDK2 (116953) in human embryonic kidney cells via its
interaction with p21. TOK1-alpha enhanced the inhibitory activity of p21
toward the histone H1 (see 142709) kinase activity of CDK2.

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney
cells, Liu et al. (2001) confirmed that BCCIP-alpha interacted with
endogenous BRCA2. Expression of BCCIP-beta protein was relatively
consistent among various tumor cell lines examined. In contrast,
expression of BCCIP-alpha protein was reduced in some brain, breast, and
endometrial tumor cell lines and increased in some endometrial tumor
cell lines, with relatively consistent expression among lung cancer cell
lines. BCCIP-alpha expression inhibited growth of some breast and brain
tumor cells, but it had no effect on other types of cancer cells.

Lu et al. (2007) stated that BCCIP regulates BRCA2 and RAD51 (179617)
nuclear focus formation, DNA double-strand break-induced homologous
recombination, and cell cycle progression. They transfected full-length
and truncated fragments of BCCIP into a human fibrosarcoma cell line and
found that BCCIP fragments that interacted with either BRCA2 or p21
inhibited homologous recombination similarly. Transient downregulation
of BCCIP in human cells did not affect nonspecific integration of
transfected DNA, but it significantly inhibited homology-directed gene
targeting. Cells with constitutive downregulation of BCCIP showed
increased levels of spontaneous single-stranded DNA and double-strand
breaks. Lu et al. (2007) concluded that multiple domains of BCCIP are
involved in homologous recombination and that BCCIP plays a critical
role in resolving spontaneous DNA damage.

Using a matched normal/tumor cDNA array, Meng et al. (2003) found
reduced expression of both BCCIP-alpha and -beta in kidney tumors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Meng et al. (2003) determined that the BCCIP gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 30 kb. The 5-prime end of the BCCIP gene abuts the UROS gene
(606938) on the opposite strand in a head-to-head manner. BCCIP and UROS
share a functional intergenic bidirectional promoter that contains
binding sites for various transcription factors. The last 3 exons of
BCCIP overlap with seven 3-prime exons of the DHX32 gene (607960) on the
opposite strand.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2001) mapped the
BCCIP gene to chromosome 10q25.3-q26.2.

613039	TITLE *613039 CHROMODOMAIN HELICASE DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 1-LIKE; CHD1L
;;AMPLIFIED IN LIVER CANCER 1; ALC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In response to DNA strand breaks, chromatin adopts a relaxed structure
due to the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) to chromatin proteins by
PARP enzymes (see PARP1; 173870), and this relaxation facilitates the
repair of DNA damage. CHD1L interacts with PAR and has a role in
chromatin relaxation following DNA damage (Ahel et al., 2009).

CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1q amplified in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 114550), Ma et al. (2008) cloned CHD1L,
which they designated ALC1. The deduced 897-amino acid protein contains
an SNF2 (see 300012)-like N-terminal helicase domain, followed by a
helicase superfamily C-terminal domain and a putative PAR-binding macro
domain. Fluorescence-tagged ALC1 localized to the nucleus in transfected
cells. Western blot analysis detected ALC1 at an apparent molecular mass
of 98 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Ma et al. (2008) found that ALC1 was
overexpressed in more than 50% of informative HCC cases, primary HCCs,
and HCC cell lines. Transfection of ALC1 in human liver and HCC cell
lines increased colony formation in soft agar compared with vector
controls and increased tumorigenicity of these cell lines in nude mice.
Overexpression of ALC1 facilitated DNA synthesis and promoted G1/S phase
transition. ALC1 downregulated expression of the cell growth inhibitors
p53 (TP53; 191170) and p21(Waf1) (CDKN1A; 116899) and the proapoptotic
proteins caspase-3 (600636) and BAX (600040) and upregulated the cell
cycle regulators CDK2 (116953) and cyclin E (CCNE1; 123837). Knockdown
of ALC1 by RNA interference reduced the percentage of cells in S phase,
reduced colony formation in soft agar, and inhibited the cell cycle at
the G1/S checkpoint. Ma et al. (2008) concluded that ALC1 is an oncogene
that plays a role in HCC pathogenesis.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Ahel et al. (2009) showed that human
ALC1 bound PAR in vitro, and the interaction required the macro domain
of ALC1. Epitope-tagged ALC1 immunoprecipitated endogenous PAR from
transfected 293 cells, along with PARP1 and core nucleosome components.
Mass spectroscopy also revealed the presence of several DNA repair
enzymes in the immunoprecipitate. ALC1 showed weak ATPase activity on
its own that was attributed to its helicase domain, and this activity
was stimulated by the addition of DNA and nucleosomes. PARP1 also
stimulated the ATPase activity of ALC1 in an NAD(+)- and DNA-dependent
manner. Wildtype ALC1, but not an ATPase-dead mutant, promoted
nucleosome sliding in an ATP-dependent manner. Endogenous ALC1 rapidly
but transiently localized to sites of DNA damage, and this localization
required ALC1 ATPase activity and functional PARP1. Ahel et al. (2009)
concluded that ALC1 is a nucleosome-repositioning enzyme that is
targeted to sites of DNA damage through its interaction with PAR, and
that ALC1 functions to regulate chromatin during DNA repair.

MAPPING

By FISH, Ma et al. (2008) mapped the CHD1L gene to a region of
chromosome 1q21 amplified in HCCs and other solid tumors.

602224	TITLE *602224 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 4E-BINDING PROTEIN 2; EIF4EBP2
;;4EBP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Pause et al. (1994) reported that the 4EBP2 gene encodes a 120-amino
acid polypeptide that is 56% identical to that of 4EBP1 (602223). By
Northern blot analysis, Tsukiyama-Kohara et al. (1996) showed that a
major 3.5-kb transcript of 4EBP2 is expressed ubiquitously.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsukiyama-Kohara et al. (1996) analyzed the genomic structure of the
mouse EIF4EBP2 gene and showed that it consists of 3 exons and spans 20
kb. Its intron/exon structure is identical to that of EIF4EBP1.

Colina et al. (2008) showed that translational control is critical for
induction of type I interferon (see 147570) production. In mouse
embryonic fibroblasts lacking the translational repressors 4Ebp1 and
4Ebp2, the threshold for eliciting type I interferon production is
lowered. Consequently, replication of encephalomyocarditis virus,
vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus, and Sindbis virus is
markedly suppressed. Furthermore, Colina et al. (2008) showed that mice
with both 4Ebp1 and 4Ebp2 genes knocked out are resistant to vesicular
stomatitis virus infection, and this correlates with an enhanced type I
interferon production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and the expression
of interferon-regulated genes in the lungs. The enhanced type I
interferon response of 4Ebp1 -/- 4Ebp2 -/- double knockout mouse
embryonic fibroblasts is caused by upregulation of interferon regulatory
factor-7 (Irf7; 605047) mRNA translation. Colina et al. (2008) found
that their findings highlighted the role of 4EBPs as negative regulators
of type I interferon production, via translational repression of IRF7
mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Dowling et al. (2010) inhibited the mTORC1 (601231) pathway in cells
lacking EIF4EBP1, EIF4EBP2, and EIF4EBP3 (603483) and analyzed the
effects on cell size, cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression.
Although the EIF4EBPs had no effect on cell size, they inhibited cell
proliferation by selectively inhibiting the translation of mRNAs that
encode proliferation-promoting proteins and proteins involved in cell
cycle progression. Thus, Dowling et al. (2010) concluded that control of
cell size and cell cycle progression appear to be independent in
mammalian cells, whereas in lower eukaryotes, EIF4E binding proteins
influence both cell growth and proliferation.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Tsukiyama-Kohara et al. (1996)
mapped the EIF4EBP2 gene to human chromosome 10q21-q22. They noted that
chromosomal alterations in this region have been found in some human
cancers. Tsukiyama-Kohara et al. (1996) mapped the mouse 4EBP2 gene to
chromosome 10B4-B5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gkogkas et al. (2013) demonstrated that knockout of EIF4EBP2, (an EIF4E
(133440) repressor downstream of MTOR), or EIF4E overexpression leads to
increased translation of neuroligins, which are postsynaptic proteins
that are causally linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mice with
knockout of Eif4ebp2 exhibit an increased ratio of excitatory to
inhibitory synaptic inputs and autistic-like behaviors (i.e., social
interaction deficits, altered communication, and repetitive/stereotyped
behaviors). Pharmacologic inhibition of Eif4e activity or normalization
of neuroligin-1 (600568), but not neuroligin-2 (606479), protein levels
restored the normal excitation/inhibition ratio and rectified the social
behavior deficits. Thus, Gkogkas et al. (2013) concluded that
translational control by EIF4E regulates the synthesis of neuroligins,
maintaining the excitation-to-inhibition balance, and its dysregulation
engenders ASD-like phenotypes.

607995	TITLE *607995 UNC93, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A; UNC93A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a candidate gene approach in the region of frequent allele loss on
chromosome 6q27 in sporadic ovarian cancer, Liu et al. (2002) identified
a human homolog of C. elegans unc93. The full-length UNC93A cDNA encodes
a deduced 457-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 50
kD. The protein contains a leader peptide followed by 7 transmembrane
domains. It shares 30% sequence identity with the C. elegans protein.
Northern blot analysis revealed a major transcript of approximately 2.1
kb in testis, small intestine, and colon; a smaller transcript of 1.1 kb
was also detected in spleen, prostate, ovary, small intestine, and
colon. No expression was detected in 8 ovarian cancer cell lines.
Transient expression of a GFP-UNC93A fusion protein in 293T cells showed
localization to the membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (2002) determined that the UNC93A gene contains 8 exons and
spans 24.5 kb. Alternative splicing results in 2 transcripts, one of
which lacks exon 4.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2002) identified the UNC93A gene on
chromosome 6q27, centromeric to marker D6S149.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By mutation analysis of the UNC93A gene in a panel of ovarian tumors and
ovarian cancer cell lines, Liu et al. (2002) found no evidence that
UNC93A is a tumor suppressor gene in sporadic ovarian cancer.

612210	TITLE *612210 HIGHLY UPREGULATED IN LIVER CANCER; HULC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 114550)-specific cDNA microarray
platform, Panzitt et al. (2007) identified HULC, a novel mRNA-like
noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of
about 500 nucleotides predominantly in HCC patient tissue. HULC RNA
localized to the cytoplasm and copurified with ribosomes. The transcript
did not appear to be translated. Panzitt et al. (2007) identified HULC
orthologs in several primate species, but not in mouse or rat.

GENE FUNCTION

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Panzitt et al. (2007) detected markedly
elevated HULC RNA in HCC liver tissue and in 3 of 4 blood samples from
HCC patients. HULC was also upregulated, but to a lesser extent, in
nonneoplastic focal nodular hyperplasias and in cirrhotic liver tissue
compared with normal tissue. Knockdown of HULC in 2 human HCC cell lines
resulted in the altered expression of numerous genes, suggesting that
HULC may be a noncoding regulatory RNA. Panzitt et al. (2007) found no
significant homology between HULC and its putative target sequences,
suggesting that any regulatory role may be indirect.

GENE STRUCTURE

Panzitt et al. (2007) determined that the HULC gene contains 2 exons,
both of which have a high CpG content. Exon 1 consists mainly of a long
terminal repeat, suggesting integration of a retrotransposon.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Panzitt et al. (2007) mapped the HULC gene
to chromosome 6p24.3.

609731	TITLE *609731 CYSTATIN 11; CST11
;;CST8L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using subtractive hybridization to identify genes expressed in Macaca
mulatta epididymis, Hamil et al. (2002) identified a novel member of the
cystatin type 2 family of competitive reversible cysteine protease
inhibitors, which they called cystatin 11. By database searching, Hamil
et al. (2002) also identified a human homolog of CST11. An additional
CST11 cDNA, missing exon 2, was amplified by PCR from a human
caput/corpus library, indicating the presence of an alternatively
spliced mRNA. Northern blot analysis of multiple M. mulatta tissues
detected abundant expression of an 0.8-kb CST11 mRNA in all 3 regions of
the epididymis but not in any other tissues tested. Imunnohistochemical
staining of human epididymis localized the CST11 protein in epithelial
cell cytoplasm and nuclei and in the lumen throughout the epididymis.
Immuonofluorescence studies showed that CST11 is also found on
ejaculated human sperm, where it is localized to the postacrosomal and
tail regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Hamil et al. (2002) found that a 3-dimensional model of CST11, based on
x-ray crystallography data for chicken CST, suggested that the 3 regions
corresponding to the protease inhibitory wedge of cystatin-3 (CST3;
604312) are similarly juxtaposed in CST11, consistent with protease
inhibitory function.

Using Northern blot analysis to study the level of CST11 mRNA in M.
Mulatta epididymis after castration and with or without androgen
replacement, Hamil et al. (2002) found that expression of CST11 is
dependent on testosterone. Consistent with this result, they showed that
the putative CST11 promoter contains a potential androgen response
element and at least 2 half sites.

Hamil et al. (2002) demonstrated that a 2-hour incubation of E. coli
with recombinant CST11 or exon 2-deleted CST11 protein resulted in a 30%
loss of colony-forming units, indicating that both forms have
antimicrobial activity.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Hamil et al. (2002) mapped the CST11 gene to
chromosome 20p11.21 near 3 other CST genes that are predominantly
expressed in the male reproductive tract.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hamil et al. (2002) demonstrated that the structure of CST11 is well
conserved with other CST2 family genes, having 3 exons and 2 identically
positioned introns.

606910	TITLE *606910 BCL2-LIKE 10; BCL2L10
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

BCL2 (151430) is a prototypic mammalian regulator of cell death. Certain
members of the BCL2 family inhibit apoptosis, while other members
facilitate this physiologic process of cell death.

Using the amino acid sequence of mouse Boo/Diva as query, Ke et al.
(2001) identified BCL2L10 in human EST and genomic databases and cloned
a BCL2L10 cDNA from a human liver cDNA library. The deduced 204-amino
acid protein contains regions resembling the BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4
domains typical of antiapoptotic members of the BCL2 family, as well as
a putative C-terminal transmembrane domain. BCL2L10 and the mouse
homolog share 47% sequence identity. RT-PCR of multiple human tissues
revealed highest expression in liver, intermediate expression in brain,
lung, pancreas and ovary, and lowest expression in heart, spleen,
thymus, colon, leukocytes, intestine, testis, and prostate.

By database searching and use of PCR, Zhang et al. (2001) identified
BCL2L10 and found that it contains conserved BH4, BH1, and BH2 domains
but lacks a BH3 domain.

Lee et al. (2001) cloned BCL2L10 from a human fetal liver and spleen
cDNA library. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.2-kb message in liver
and kidney. Immunolocalization studies showed that BCL2L10 is diffusely
expressed in the cytosol of hepatocytes and in epithelial cells of
ovarian follicles.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Ke et al. (2001) found interaction
between BCL2L10 and BAX (600040), BCL2, and BCLXL (600039), but not with
BAK (600516). By transient transfection performed in 4 different human
tumor cell lines, Ke et al. (2001) determined that BCL2L10 has
antiapoptotic action. Stable overexpression in HeLa cells also resulted
in increased resistance to diverse apoptotic stimuli. The authors noted,
however, that because BCL2L10 is capable of associating either with the
antiapoptotic proteins BCL2 and BCLXL or with the proapoptotic protein
BAX, it is possible that BCL2L10 could display different phenotypes
depending on the cellular context.

By transfection experiments, Zhang et al. (2001) demonstrated that
BCL2L10 can block apoptosis induced by interleukin-3 (147740) withdrawal
and Bax (600040) expression, by prevention of cytochrome C (123970)
release, caspase-3 (600636) activation, and mitochondrial membrane
potential collapse. BCL2L10 did not block TNF-alpha (191160)-induced
apoptosis. Furthermore, both the BH4 domain and the transmembrane domain
of BCL2L10 were necessary for its suppressive action on cell death.
Zhang et al. (2001) concluded that BCL2L10 is an antiapoptotic member of
the BCL2 family and that it blocks apoptosis in the mitochondrial death
pathway, but not in the death receptor pathway.

By immunoprecipitation studies of BCL2L10-transfected cells, Lee et al.
(2001) confirmed interaction between BCL2L10 and BCLXL. By transient
transfection of fluorescence-tagged BCL2L10, Lee et al (2001) found
that, upon induction of apoptosis, the well-dispersed intracellular
granular localization pattern shifted to the perinuclear compartment,
with staining overlapping that of a mitochondrial marker. In contrast to
the results of Ke et al. (2001), Lee et al. (2001) found that
overexpression of BCL2L10 promoted cell death in HeLa and human kidney
cells.

Naumann et al. (2001) investigated the effect of BCL2L10 on induction of
apoptosis with the CD95 (134637) ligand and with chemotherapeutic drugs
in human malignant glioma cell lines. BCL2L10-transfected cells were
more sensitive to serum deprivation and became growth arrested in G0/1
in contrast to parental cells or mock-transfected cells.
BCL2L10-transfected glioma cells were also more resistant to induction
of apoptosis. BCL2L10 reduced caspase activation, including caspases 8
and 3, but did not prevent release of cytochrome c. The authors noted,
however, that others have found BCL2L10 to induce apoptosis in other
cell systems.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ke et al. (2001) determined that the BCL2L10 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

Ke et al. (2001) mapped the BCL2L10 gene to chromosome 15q21 based on
sequence similarity between the BCL2L10 sequence and a genomic clone
(GenBank GENBANK CTD-2184D3) localized to 15q21. Lee et al. (2001)
mapped BCL2L10 to chromosome 15q21 by radiation hybrid analysis. The
corresponding mouse gene maps to a region of syntenic homology on
chromosome 9D9.

603491	TITLE *603491 IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 3; IGSF3
DESCRIPTION Saupe et al. (1998) isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like membrane protein, named immunoglobulin
superfamily member-3 (IGSF3). The deduced 1,215-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal signal sequence followed by a large extracellular
domain composed of 8 Ig-like domains with 7 potential N-glycosylation
sites; a potential hydrophobic transmembrane domain; and a C-terminal
charged cytoplasmic tail. The Ig-like domains are of the V type, and a
search of the sequence databases revealed that the IGSF3 protein is 32%
identical to human V7 (604516), a leukocyte surface protein. The authors
detected a major 8-kb mRNA and minor 6- and 4-kb mRNA species in a
variety of human tissues by Northern blot analysis.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrid analyses,
Saupe et al. (1998) localized the human IGSF3 gene to 1p13 and
demonstrated the presence of related sequences on chromosomes 2 and 13.

120105	TITLE *120105 COLIPASE, PANCREATIC; CLPS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pancreatic colipase is a 12-kD polypeptide cofactor for pancreatic
lipase (EC 3.1.1.3; 246600), an enzyme essential for the absorption of
dietary long-chain triglyceride fatty acids. Colipase is thought to
anchor lipase noncovalently to the surface of lipid micelles,
counteracting the destabilizing influence of intestinal bile salts
(summary by Davis et al., 1991).

CLONING

Using primers derived from the known amino acid sequence, Davis et al.
(1991) employed the PCR to produce a cDNA clone corresponding to the
complete coding region of the human procolipase mRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sims and Lowe (1992) found that the CLPS gene has 3 exons and that the
5-prime-flanking region contains a TATA box, a GC box, and a 28-bp
region with homology to the rat pancreatic-specific enhancer.

MAPPING

By the study of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids, Davis et al. (1991)
determined that the CLPS gene is located in the region 6pter-p21.1.

Sims and Lowe (1992) confirmed the assignment of the CLPS gene to
chromosome 6 by blots of hamster-human somatic cell hybrid DNA using the
entire colipase cDNA.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2006) reported a mechanism by which constant darkness
regulates the gene expression of fat catabolic enzymes in mice. Genes
for murine procolipase (Clps) and pancreatic lipase-related protein-2
(Plrp2; 604423) are activated in a circadian manner in peripheral organs
during 12-hour dark:12-hour dark (DD) but not light-dark (LD) cycles.
This mechanism is deregulated in circadian-deficient Per1/Per2 double
mutant mice. Zhang et al. (2006) identified circadian-regulated
5-prime-AMP, which is elevated in the blood of DD mice, as a key
mediator of this response. Synthetic 5-prime-AMP induced torpor (a
hibernation-like state) and murine Clps expression in LD mice. Torpor
induced by metabolic stress was associated with elevated 5-prime-AMP
levels in DD mice. Levels of glucose and nonesterified fatty acid in the
blood were reversed in DD and LD mice. Induction of murine Clps
expression by 5-prime-AMP in LD mice was reciprocally linked to blood
glucose levels. Zhang et al. (2006) concluded that their findings
uncovered a circadian metabolic rhythm in mammals.

DESCRIPTION Wicki et al. (1996) reported the characterization of a human gene they
symbolized S100A13, a calcium-binding protein belonging to the S100
protein family. S100 proteins are small EF-hand calcium-binding proteins
of variable lengths and sequence identities. At least 12 of 15 members
of the family are clustered on chromosome 1q21 (see S100A1; 176940);
S100A13 likewise colocalizes with S100A1 on the 1q21 cluster. The
predicted 98 amino acid S100A13 protein shows sequence homologies to
other S100 proteins between 50.5% (S100A5; 176991) and 59.3% (S100A12;
603112). Northern blot analysis showed high amounts of S100A13 mRNA in
adult skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, ovary, spleen, small intestine,
and pancreas and in fetal lung, heart, cochlea, liver, spleen, and
parathyroid tumor cells. Moderate levels were detected in all other
tissues examined, with the exception of placenta and leukocytes, which
had very low or undetectable levels. Wicki et al. (1996) also cloned the
mouse S100A13 gene. Mouse S100A13 is composed of 98 amino acids and
displays 86.7% homology compared to human S100A13.

615393	TITLE *615393 MTERF DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; MTERFD2
;;MITOCHONDRIAL TRANSCRIPTION TERMINATION FACTOR 4; MTERF4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MTERFD2 forms a stoichiometric complex with the 5-methylcytosine RNA
methyltransferase NSUN4 (615394). By binding to both ribosomal RNA and
NSUN4, MTERFD2 recruits NSUN4 to the large ribosomal subunit, an
essential step in ribosomal biogenesis (Spahr et al., 2012).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of HeLa cell total RNA, Yu et al. (2011) cloned MTERFD2, which
they called MTERF4. The deduced 381-amino acid protein has a predicted
mitochondrial localization signal, multiple leucine zipper motifs, 2
basic DNA-binding domains, and a C terminus with many acidic amino acids
not found in other MTERF proteins. Fluorescence-tagged MTERF4 localized
to mitochondria in transfected HeLa cells.

Using Northern blot analysis, Camara et al. (2011) detected variable
Mterf4 expression in all mouse tissues examined. Fluorescence-tagged
mouse or human MTERF4 colocalized with mitochondrial markers following
transfection of HeLa cells. Sequence analysis revealed that MTERF4 was
processed into mature proteins beginning with either leu43 or asn48
following targeting to mitochondria.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the MTERFD2 gene to chromosome 2q37.3 based on an
alignment of the MTERFD2 sequence (Genbank GENBANK AF161359) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using small interfering RNA, Yu et al. (2011) found that knockdown of
MTERF4 in HeLa cells suppressed cell growth and induced accumulation of
cells in sub-G1. Downregulation of MTERF4 also significantly induced
necrosis, but not apoptosis.

By immunoprecipitation analysis and size-exclusion chromatography,
Camara et al. (2011) showed that the mature mitochondrial forms of NSUN4
and MTERF4 (beginning with asn48) interacted in HeLa cells to form a
dimer with an apparent molecular mass of 112 kD . The epitope-tagged
MTERF4-NSUN4 complex comigrated with the large (39S) mitochondrial
ribosomal subunit following transfection in HeLa cells. Knockdown of
MTERF4 via RNA interference reduced targeting of NSUN4 to the 39S
subunit. RNA immunoprecipitation showed that epitope-tagged MTERF4
cross-linked with several ribosomal RNA species, including 16S, 12S, and
7S RNA. Camara et al. (2011) concluded that MTERF4 targets NSUN4 to
ribosomal RNA through to its ability to bind both NSUN4 and ribosomal
RNA.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Spahr et al. (2012) described the structure of the NSUN4-MTERF4
heterodimeric complex at 2.9-angstrom resolution. They found that MTERF4
is an all alpha-helical protein that adopts a half-doughnut shape with a
right-handed superhelical twist. MTERF4 bound NSUN4 through conserved
polar and hydrophobic interactions. A positively-charged RNA-binding
path extended along the concave and convex sides of MTERF4 and into the
active site of NSUN4 near the the binding site for the methyl donor
S-adenosyl-L-methionine.

ANIMAL MODEL

Camara et al. (2011) found that knockout of Mterf4 in mice was embryonic
lethal. At embryonic day 8.5, Mterf4 -/- embryos were smaller than
wildtype and lacked a heart and optic discs. Targeted knockout of Mterf4
in cardiac tissue caused gradual accumulation of myocardial mitochondria
with abnormal morphology from 5 weeks of age, and reduced life span to
21 weeks of age. Analysis of steady-state levels of respiratory chain
complexes in Mterf4 -/- hearts revealed reduced assembly of
mitochondrial encoded subunits (complex I, III, IV, and V) compared with
exclusively nuclear-encoded complex II, accompanied by reduced
respiratory chain activities. Mterf4 -/- hearts also showed massively
increased transcription of mitochondrial DNA coupled with impaired
translation, as well as dramatically increased levels of the 28S and 39S
mitochondrial ribosomes without a corresponding increase in the
assembled 55S ribosome.

;;PCDH-BETA-11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHB11
is 1 of 16 tandemly arranged genes in the PCDHB gene cluster (604967) on
chromosome 5q31. Unlike the PCDHA (see 604966) and PCDHG (see 604968)
genes, which function as 'variable' exons that are spliced to downstream
constant region exons to produce mRNAs, the PCDHB genes do not use
constant region exons to produce mRNAs. Thus, each single-exon PCDHB
gene encodes the extracellular, transmembrane, and short cytoplasmic
domains of the protein (Wu et al., 2001). For further information on the
PCDHB genes, see 604967.

CLONING

Using PCR with degenerate primers to screen melanoma cell lines,
Matsuyoshi et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA fragment encoding part of
PCDHB11, which they termed ME2. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of
ME2 in melanoma, squamous carcinoma, and normal fibroblast cell lines,
but not in normal melanocytes, suggesting that ME2 may play a role in
the strong cell-cell adhesiveness of melanoma cells.

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHB11.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHB11 gene
to chromosome 5q31. They localized the mouse PCDHB genes to chromosome
18c.

;;SAPK-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; SIN1;;
MEKK2-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; MIP1;;
JC310
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SIN1, MTOR (FRAP1; 601231), RICTOR (609022), and LST8 (GBL; 612190) are
components of TORC2, a protein kinase complex involved in AKT (164730)
phosphorylation and cell signaling (Yang et al., 2006).

CLONING

By screening an expression library for cDNAs that suppressed the heat
shock-sensitive phenotype of yeast with an activated Ras2 gene (see
HRAS; 190020), Colicelli et al. (1991) obtained a partial cDNA encoding
MAPKAP1, which they called JC310.

By searching an EST database with the partial JC310 sequence, followed
by RT-PCR, Schroder et al. (2004) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding
MAPKAP1, which they called SIN1. The deduced 522-amino acid protein has
a nuclear localization signal, 2 bipartite nuclear localization signals,
a peroxisomal targeting signal, and a PEST motif for rapid protein
degradation. Comparison of SIN1 with homologs from various species
revealed a short, highly conserved region, designated Box1, located
within a larger conserved domain, designated CRIM (conserved region in
middle). Schroder et al. (2004) also identified several SIN1 splice
variants, including SIN1-alpha, which encodes a 323-amino acid
C-terminally truncated protein, and SIN1-beta and SIN1-gamma, which
encode 487- and 475-amino acid proteins, respectively, with internal
deletions. Two other variants, SIN1-delta and SIN1-epsilon, lack the
first coding exon and the first 2 coding exons of SIN1, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected SIN1 transcripts of 3.8 and 2.6 kb in
all tissues examined, with highest levels in skeletal muscle and heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Yang et al. (2006) identified SIN1 as an essential component of TORC2,
but not TORC1. SIN1 specifically interacted with MTOR and RICTOR, but
not RAPTOR (607130), the defining component of the TORC1 complex.
Knockdown of SIN1 resulted in decreased RICTOR phosphorylation and
protein levels, as well as disruption of binding between RICTOR and
MTOR. RICTOR knockdown dramatically decreased SIN1 protein levels.
Knockdown of SIN1 in both Drosophila and human cells diminished AKT
phosphorylation, and SIN1-knockdown cells displayed less phosphorylation
of AKT substrates and more sensitivity to apoptosis.

Independently, Jacinto et al. (2006) identified SIN1 as an essential
TORC2 subunit in human cells. Phosphorylation of Akt at ser473 was lost
in Sin1 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), whereas phosphorylation
of thr308 was unaffected. Defective ser473 phosphorylation affected only
a subset of Akt targets in vivo, including Foxo1 (136533) and Foxo3a
(602681). Sin1 -/- MEFs were more sensitive to stress-induced apoptosis,
suggesting that phosphorylation of AKT at ser473 plays an important role
in cell survival.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schroder et al. (2004) determined that the MAPKAP1 gene contains 13
exons, the first of which is noncoding. The 5-prime region contains 2
short open reading frames of 9 and 5 codons, and the 3-prime region
contains 2 polyadenylation sites.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MAPKAP1
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP RH41772).

ANIMAL MODEL

Jacinto et al. (2006) found that Sin1 deletion was embryonic lethal in
mice due to early developmental problems.

EXTRACELLULAR SIGNAL-REGULATED KINASE 1; ERK1;;

p44MAPK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Charest et al. (1993) cloned a cDNA encoding a member of a family of
tyrosyl-phosphorylated and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
that participates in cell cycle progression. They referred to the
protein as p44(erk1) and the gene as ERK1. The cDNA encodes a 379-amino
acid polypeptide sharing approximately 96% predicted amino acid identity
with partial sequences of rodent erk1 cognates. They also characterized
the enzyme biochemically.

MAPPING

Charest et al. (1993) mapped the MAPK3 gene to human chromosome 16 by
hybrid cell panel analysis. Li et al. (1994) assigned human MAPK3 and
MAPK1 to 16p11.2 and 22q11.2, respectively, by a combination of Southern
blotting of a human-hamster hybrid panel and fluorescence in situ
hybridization. The chromosome region surrounding 16p11.2 displays high
homology with mouse chromosome 7, and human 22q11.2 is homologous to
mouse chromosome 16. Saba-El-Leil et al. (1997) mapped the murine
homolog (Mapk3) to mouse chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Experience-dependent plasticity in the developing visual cortex depends
on electrical activity and molecular signals involved in stabilization
or removal of inputs. ERK1 and ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) activation in the
cortex is regulated by both factors. Di Cristo et al. (2001)
demonstrated that 2 different inhibitors of the ERK pathway suppress the
induction of 2 forms of long-term potentiation in rat cortical slices
and that their intracortical administration to monocularly deprived rats
prevents the shift in ocular dominance towards the nondeprived eye. Di
Cristo et al. (2001) concluded that the ERK pathway is necessary for
experience-dependent plasticity and for long-term potentiation of
synaptic transmission in the developing visual cortex.

Stefanovsky et al. (2001) showed that epidermal growth factor (131530)
induces immediate, ERK1/ERK2-dependent activation of endogenous
ribosomal transcription, while inactivation of ERK1/ERK2 causes an
equally immediate reversion to the basal transcription level. ERK1/ERK2
was found to phosphorylate the architectural transcription factor UBF
(600673) at amino acids 117 and 201 within HMG boxes 1 and 2, preventing
their interaction with DNA. Mutation of these sites inhibited
transcription activation and abrogated the transcriptional response to
ERK1/ERK2. Thus, growth factor regulation of ribosomal transcription
likely acts by a cyclic modulation of DNA architecture. The data
suggested a central role for ribosome biogenesis in growth regulation.

Using an in situ phosphorylation screening strategy to identify protein
kinase substrates, Fukunaga and Hunter (1997) identified MNK1 (MKNK1;
606724) as an ERK1 substrate. Using 2-hybrid tests and in vitro
association experiments, Waskiewicz et al. (1997) demonstrated that
mouse Mnk1 and Mnk2 (MKNK2; 605069) bind tightly to Erk1 and Erk2
through a C-terminal domain. Mnk1 complexes more strongly with inactive
than active Erk, and the authors hypothesized that Mnk and Erk may
dissociate after mitogen stimulation.

Forcet et al. (2002) showed that in embryonic kidney cells expressing
full-length, but not cytoplasmic domain-truncated, DCC (120470), NTN1
(601614) causes increased transient phosphorylation and activity of ERK1
and ERK2, but not of JNK1 (601158), JNK2 (602896), or p38 (MAPK14;
600289). This phosphorylation was mediated by MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872)
and/or MEK2 (MAP2K2; 601263). NTN1 also activated the transcription
factor ELK1 (311040) and serum response element-regulated gene
expression. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed interaction of
full-length DCC with MEK1/2 in the presence or absence of NTN1. Forcet
et al. (2002) showed that activation of Dcc by Ntn1 in rat embryonic
day-13 dorsal spinal cord stimulates and is required for the outgrowth
of commissural axons and Erk1/2 activation. Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated expression of activated Erk1/2 in embryonic commissural
axons, and this expression was diminished in Dcc or Ntn1 knockout
animals. Forcet et al. (2002) concluded that the MAPK pathway is
involved in responses to NTN1 and proposed that ERK activation affects
axonal growth by phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins and
neurofilaments.

Anthrax lethal toxin (LT), a critical virulence factor of Bacillus
anthracis, is a complex of lethal factor (LF) and protective antigen
(PA). PA binds to the anthrax receptor (ATR; 606410) to facilitate the
entry of LF into the cell. LT disrupts the MAPK signaling pathway in
macrophages (Park et al., 2002). Agrawal et al. (2003) showed that, in
mice, LT impairs the function of dendritic cells (DCs), inhibiting the
upregulation of costimulatory molecules, such as CD40 (109535), CD80
(112203), and CD86 (601020), as well as cytokine secretion, in response
to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. LT-exposed DCs failed to stimulate
antigen-specific T and B cells in vivo, resulting in significant
reductions of circulating IgG antibody. Western blot analysis indicated
that LF severely impairs phosphorylation of p38, ERK1, and ERK2. A
cocktail of synthetic MAPK inhibitors inhibited cytokine production in a
manner similar to that of LF. Using a mutant form of LF lacking a
catalytic site necessary for cleavage of MEK1, MEK2, and MEK3 (602314),
the upstream activators of ERK1, ERK2, and p38, respectively, Agrawal et
al. (2003) found that cleavage of these MEKs is essential for
suppression of dendritic cell function. They proposed that this
mechanism might operate early in infection, when LT levels are low, to
impair immunity. Later in infection, Agrawal et al. (2003) noted, LT
might have quite different inflammatory effects.

Imai et al. (2008) used mouse models to explore the mechanism whereby
obesity enhances pancreatic beta cell mass, pathophysiologic
compensation for insulin resistance. Imai et al. (2008) found that
hepatic activation of ERK1 signaling by expression of constitutively
active MEK1 (176872) induced pancreatic beta cell proliferation through
a neuronal-mediated relay of metabolic signals. This metabolic relay
from the liver to the pancreas is involved in obesity-induced islet
expansion. In mouse models of insulin-deficient diabetes,
liver-selective activation of ERK signaling increased beta cell mass and
normalized serum glucose levels. Thus, Imai et al. (2008) concluded that
interorgan metabolic relay systems may serve as valuable targets in
regenerative treatments for diabetes.

In mouse hearts with pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy, Lorenz et al.
(2009) observed strong phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 at thr183, and in
failing human hearts, they found an approximately 5-fold increase in
thr188 phosphorylation compared to controls. The authors demonstrated
that thr188 autophosphorylation directs ERK1/ERK2 to phosphorylate
nuclear targets known to cause cardiac hypertrophy, and that thr188
phosphorylation requires activation and assembly of the entire RAF
(164760)-MEK-ERK kinase cascade, phosphorylation of the TEY motif,
dimerization of ERK1/ERK2, and binding to G protein beta-gamma subunits
(see 139390) released from activated Gq (see 600998). Experiments using
transgenic mouse models carrying mutations at thr188 suggested a causal
relationship to cardiac hypertrophy. Lorenz et al. (2009) proposed that
specific phosphorylation events on ERK1/ERK2 integrate differing
upstream signals to induce cardiac hypertrophy.

During early lung development, airway tubes change shape. Tube length
increases more than circumference as a large proportion of lung
epithelial cells divide parallel to the airway longitudinal axis. Tang
et al. (2011) showed that this bias is lost in mutants with increased
ERK1 and ERK2 activity, revealing a link between the ERK1/2 signaling
pathway and the control of mitotic spindle orientation. Using a
mathematical model, Tang et al. (2011) demonstrated that change in
airway shape can occur as a function of spindle angle distribution
determined by ERK1/2 signaling, independent of effects on cell
proliferation or cell size and shape. Tang et al. (2011) identified
sprouty genes (SPRY1, 602465; SPRY2, 602466), which encode negative
regulators of fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF10; 602115)-mediated
RAS-regulated ERK1/2 signaling, as essential for controlling airway
shape change during development through an effect on mitotic spindle
orientation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pages et al. (1999) generated p44 Mapk (Erk1)-deficient mice by
homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. The p44 Mapk were
viable, fertile, and of normal size. Thus, Pages et al. (1999) concluded
that p44 Mapk is apparently dispensable and that p42 Mapk (Erk2) may
compensate for its loss. However, in p44 Mapk -/- mice, thymocyte
maturation beyond the CD4+CD8+ stage was reduced by half, with a similar
diminution in the thymocyte subpopulation expressing high levels of T
cell receptor (CD3-high). In p44 Mapk -/- thymocytes, proliferation in
response to activation with a monoclonal antibody to the T cell receptor
in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate was severely reduced even
though activation of p42 Mapk was more sustained in these cells. Thus,
Pages et al. (1999) concluded that p44 Mapk apparently has a specific
role in thymocyte development.

In behavioral tests with mice lacking Erk1, Mazzucchelli et al. (2002)
observed an enhancement of striatum-dependent long-term memory that
correlated with a facilitation of long-term potentiation in the nucleus
accumbens. At the cellular level, ablation of Erk1 resulted in a
stimulus-dependent increase of Erk2 signaling, which Mazzucchelli et al.
(2002) stated was likely due to its enhanced interaction with the
upstream kinase Mek. They concluded that Erk1 has a critical regulatory
role in the long-term adaptive changes underlying striatum-dependent
behavioral plasticity and drug addiction.

A surge of luteinizing hormone (LH; see 152780) from the pituitary gland
triggers ovulation, oocyte maturation, and luteinization for successful
reproduction in mammals. Because the signaling molecules RAS (190020)
and ERK1/2 are activated by an LH surge in granulosa cells of
preovulatory follicles, Fan et al. (2009) disrupted Erk1/2 in mouse
granulosa cells and provided in vivo evidence that these kinases are
necessary for LH-induced oocyte resumption of meiosis, ovulation, and
luteinization. In addition, biochemical analyses and selected disruption
of the Cebpb gene (189965) in granulosa cells demonstrated that
C/EBP-beta is a critical downstream mediator of ERK1/2 activation. Thus,
Fan et al. (2009) concluded that ERK1/2 and C/EBP-beta constitute an in
vivo LH-regulated signaling pathway that controls ovulation- and
luteinization-related events.

Holm et al. (2011) showed that Erk1/2 and Smad2 (601366) are activated
in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome, and both are inhibited by therapies
directed against Tgf-beta (190180). Whereas selective inhibition of
ERK1/2 activation ameliorated aortic growth, Smad4 (600993) deficiency
exacerbated aortic disease and caused premature death in Marfan syndrome
mice. Smad4-deficient Marfan syndrome mice uniquely showed activation of
Jnk1 (601158), and a Jnk antagonist ameliorated aortic growth in Marfan
mice that lacked or retained full Smad4 expression. Thus, Holm et al.
(2011) concluded that noncanonical (Smad-independent) Tgf-beta signaling
is a prominent driver of aortic disease in Marfan syndrome mice, and
inhibition of the ERK1/2 or JNK1 pathways is a potential therapeutic
strategy for the disease.

MITOCHONDRIAL THRRS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases containing a
mitochondrial targeting sequence, Bonnefond et al. (2005) identified
TARS2, which the called mitochondrial THRRS. The deduced 718-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal with a
predicted cleavage site after residue 39. TARS2 has characteristics of a
class II mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and is expected to
function as a dimer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bonnefond et al. (2005) determined that the TARS2 gene contains 18 exons
and spans 19.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bonnefond et al. (2005) mapped the TARS2
gene to chromosome 1.

;;ZF87;;
PUR1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The c-Myc protooncogene (190080) encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein
involved in malignant tumorigenesis. The MYC gene product functions as a
DNA-specific transcription factor. A related polypeptide called MAX
(154950), for MYC-associated factor X, dimerizes with MYC to optimize
DNA binding. A paucity of negative regulatory elements have been
reported for the MYC gene which regulate transcription from 2 initiation
sites specified by the P1 and P2 promoters. ME1a1, a 16-bp nuclear
nuclear factor binding site residing between MYC P1 and P2 transcription
initiation sites, is required for P2 activity. Bossone et al. (1992)
cloned a cDNA encoding a 477-amino acid zinc finger protein, designated
MAZ (MYC-associated zinc finger protein), from a HeLa cell cDNA library
by screening with a concatamerized ME1a1 binding site probe. Its mRNA
was present in all tissues tested (except kidney) as a doublet of
approximately 2.5 to 2.7 kb, along with differentially expressed minor
species. The authors speculated that MAZ may encode a transcription
factor with dual roles in transcription initiation and termination.

Kennedy and Rutter (1992) cloned a full-length cDNA of Pur1 from a mouse
islet cell line. By sequence analysis, they identified MAZ as the human
homolog of mouse Pur1. The deduced hamster, mouse, and human proteins
share approximately 94% sequence identity.

Tsutsui et al. (1996) used Southwestern methods to screen a human
pancreatic islet cell cDNA library for genes encoding proteins that
could bind specifically to the nuclease hypersensitive element of human
c-myc. They identified a gene, named MAZi (for Myc-associated zinc
finger protein of islet), which had a 497-bp open reading frame and was
found to be 99.8% identical to MAZ. The only differences between MAZi
and MAZ were a different 5-prime noncoding region and a shorter
polyalanine tract (11 vs 16 alanines). Thus, MAZi is likely to be a
product of the MAZ gene. However, Tsutsui et al. (1996) reported that
the expression pattern and transcript size of MAZi differed from that of
MAZ. The authors found that a 2.6-kb MAZi transcript was expressed at 5-
to 10-fold higher levels in rat islet carcinoma cells than in normal rat
islet cells and that transfection of islet cells with MAZi resulted in
enhanced expression of a c-myc/reporter construct. The authors suggested
that MAZi may be a positive factor that enhances the expression of c-myc
in islet cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kennedy and Rutter (1992) identified a transcription factor, which they
referred to as Pur1 because of its ability to bind to purine-rich
sequences, from a hamster insulinoma cell line. Such purine-rich
stretches of nucleotides (GAGA boxes) are often found just upstream of
transcription start sites in many genes, including insulin (INS;
176730). Mutation analysis suggested that the GAGA box plays an
important role in transcription of the rat insulin I gene. Kennedy and
Rutter (1992) found that Pur1 binds to the GAGA boxes of the rat insulin
I and II genes and the human islet amyloid polypeptide gene.
Cotransfection experiments showed that Pur1 is a potent transactivator
in both pancreatic and nonpancreatic cells. Pur1 was also found to
stimulate transcription from the intact rat insulin I promoter in HeLa
cells, where the promoter is normally inactive.

Song et al. (1998) showed that both MAZ protein and mRNA levels are
modulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

Gastrin (GAS; 137250) regulates the expression of a variety of genes
involved in the control of acid secretion. It also triggers tissue
response to damage, infection, and inflammation in cells expressing
gastrin receptor (CCKBR; 118445) and, indirectly, in nearby cells via a
paracrine mechanism. Almeida-Vega et al. (2009) found that gastrin
directly induced upregulation of the antiapoptotic regulator PAI2
(SERPINB2; 173390) in CCKBR-positive cells. CCKBR-positive cells also
released IL8 (146930) and prostaglandin E2 into the culture medium in
response to gastrin, which resulted in elevated PAI2 expression in
cocultured CCKBR-negative cells. IL8 signaling in CCKBR-negative cells
upregulated PAI2 via binding of the ASC1 complex (see TRIP4; 604501) to
the PAI2 promoter. Prostaglandin E2 independently upregulated PAI2 via
RHOA (165390)-dependent signaling that induced binding of MAZ to the
PAI2 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that MAZ and the p50 subunit of
the ASC1 complex (ASCC1; 614215) bound directly to sites in the PAI2
promoter. Mutation of the putative MAZ site in the PAI2 promoter reduced
responses to RHOA. Knockdown of the p50 or p65 (TRIP4) subunits of the
ASC1 complex via small interfering RNA significantly reduced PAI2
upregulation in response to gastrin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Song et al. (1998) found that the MAZ gene contains 5 exons and spans
approximately 6 kb. The promoter region has features typical of a
housekeeping gene. The authors identified regulatory elements in the
5-prime flanking sequence that are involved in basal transcription and
in the autoregulation of the MAZ gene by the MAZ protein.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Song et al. (1998, 1998) mapped
the MAZ gene to chromosome 16p11.2, within 1.2 kb of the KNLS4 (603213)
gene.

600702	TITLE *600702 SODIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, TYPE VIII, ALPHA SUBUNIT; SCN8A
;;NAV1.6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-dependent sodium channels, such as SCN8A, are responsible for
the initial membrane depolarization that occurs during generation of
action potentials in most electrically excitable cells (Plummer et al.,
1998).

CLONING

Plummer et al. (1998) isolated and sequenced genomic fragments
containing the exons of a novel human voltage-gated sodium channel
designated SCN8A. SCN8A encodes a 1,980-amino acid protein that shares
close to 99% sequence identity with the mouse protein. It contains
several consensus sites for phosphorylation of serine and threonine
residues that are also conserved in other sodium channel family members.

Plummer et al. (1997) identified 2 alternatively spliced exons of SCN8A,
18N and 18A, that encode transmembrane segments S3 and S4 in domain III.
Exon 18N is expressed in fetal brain and nonneuronal tissues.
Transcripts with exon 18N have a conserved in-frame stop codon that
predicts the synthesis of a truncated, 2-domain protein. The proportion
of transcripts containing exon 18N is highest in mouse fetal brain
between embryonic day (E) 12.5 and E14.5; at E18.5 and later, the 18A
transcript predominates.

GENE STRUCTURE

Plummer et al. (1998) determined that the SCN8A gene contains 28 exons
and identified an additional pair of alternatively spliced exons, 5N and
5A, that encode transmembrane segments of domain I. Exons 5N and 5A
differ by a single amino acid difference at position 7. Plummer et al.
(1998) also found that major and minor protein transcripts are generated
by 2 alternative splice donor sites for exon 10B; the minor transcript
contains 11 extra amino acids.

Drews et al. (2007) identified 4 untranslated 5-prime exons, which they
designated 1a through 1d, in the mouse and human SCN8A genes. These
exons are mutually exclusive, and each is alternatively spliced to the
first coding exon. Exon 1a overlaps with an inserted LINE element, and
the 70-kb interval between the 5-prime noncoding exons and the first
coding exon contains 58% repetitive elements and simple repeats. The
Scn8a genes of lower vertebrates contain only a single 5-prime
untranslated exon that corresponds to mouse and human exon 1c. Exon 1c
contains conserved functional YY1 (600013) and REST (600571) sites.

GENE FUNCTION

Active invasion of the dendritic tree by action potentials generated in
the axon is essential for associative synaptic plasticity and neuronal
ensemble formation. In cortical pyramidal cells, this action potential
back-propagation is supported by dendritic voltage-gated sodium
channels. Using a highly sensitive electron microscopic immunogold
technique, Lorincz and Nusser (2010) revealed the presence of the Nav1.6
subunit in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell proximal and distal dendrites.
Here, the subunit density is lower by a factor of 35 to 80 than that
found in axon initial segments. A gradual decrease in Nav1.6 density
along the proximodistal axis of the dendritic tree was also detected
without any labeling in dendritic spines. Lorincz and Nusser (2010)
concluded that their results revealed the characteristic subcellular
distribution of the Nav1.6 subunit, identifying this molecule as a key
substrate enabling dendritic excitability.

MAPPING

Kohrman et al. (1995) assigned the mouse Scn8a gene to chromosome 15 by
interspecific backcross analysis and the human SCN8A gene to chromosome
12 by hybridization to a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel. Burgess et
al. (1995) mapped the human homolog to 12q13 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. By physical mapping on a YAC contig, Plummer et al.
(1998) localized the SCN8A gene to 12q13.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Because SCN8A is widely expressed in neurons of the central and
peripheral nervous systems, and because mutations in the mouse ortholog
result in ataxia and other movement disorders, Trudeau et al. (2006)
screened the 26 coding exons of SCN8A in 151 patients with inherited or
sporadic ataxia. They found a 2-bp deletion in exon 24 (600702.0001) in
a 9-year-old boy with mental retardation, pancerebellar atrophy, and
ataxia (CIAT; 614306). Three additional family members who were
heterozygous for this mutation exhibited milder cognitive behavioral
deficits including attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD;
143465). No additional occurrence of this mutation was observed in 625
unrelated DNA samples (1,250 chromosomes).

In a girl with infantile epileptic encephalopathy-13 (EIEE13; 614558),
Veeramah et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in the
SCN8A gene (N1768D; 600702.0002). In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutation caused a dominant gain-of-function effect, with
neuronal hyperexcitability, persistent sodium currents, incomplete
channel inactivation, increased spontaneous firing,
paroxysmal-depolarizing-shift-like complexes, and an increased firing
frequency.

Carvill et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous mutation in the SCN8A
gene (L12890V; 600702.0003) in a boy with EIEE13. The mutation was
inherited from his father, who was found to be somatic mosaic for the
mutation. No further clinical information was provided. The patient was
part of a cohort of 500 cases of epileptic encephalopathy who underwent
sequencing of candidate genes; he was the only patient found to carry an
SCN8A mutation.

ANIMAL MODEL

The mouse neurologic mutant 'motor endplate disease' (med) is
characterized by early-onset progressive paralysis of the hindlimbs,
severe muscle atrophy, degeneration of Purkinje cells, and juvenile
lethality. Burgess et al. (1995) isolated a voltage-gated sodium channel
gene, Scn8a, from the flanking region of a transgene-induced allele of
med. Scn8a is expressed in brain and spinal cord but not in skeletal
muscle or heart, and encodes a predicted protein of 1,732 amino acids.
An intragenic deletion at the site of transgene insertion resulted in
loss of expression. The gene is closely related to other sodium channel
alpha subunits: SCN1A (182389), SCN2A (182390), SCN3A (182391), SCN4A
(603967), SCN5A (600163), and SCN6A (182392). Kohrman et al. (1996)
identified a missense mutation in Scn8a that is associated with
cerebellar ataxia in the 'jolting' mutant, a mild allele of the med
locus. Kohrman et al. (1996) described the molecular changes in Scn8a
underlying 2 other spontaneous mutants, med and med(J). The med mutation
was caused by insertion of a truncated LINE element into exon 2 of
Scn8a. The med transcript was spliced from exon 1 to a cryptic acceptor
site in intron 2. In the med(J) allele, a 4-bp deletion within 5-prime
donor site of exon 3 resulted in splicing from exon 1 to exon 4. Both
mutant transcripts altered the reading frame with premature stop codons
close to the N terminus of the protein. Loss of Scn8a expression
resulted in progressive paralysis and early death. Intron 2 of Scn8a is
flanked by minor class AT-AC splice sites. The observed splicing
patterns of the med and med(J) mutant transcripts provided evidence for
preferential in vivo splicing between donor and acceptor sites of the
same class. The apparent functional incompatibility may be a consequence
of the different composition of spliceosomes bound to major and minor
splice sites. The unusual pattern of exon skipping in these mutant
identified Scn8a as a member of a small group of genes containing
introns with nonstandard AT-AC splice sites. AT-AC introns are processed
by alternative splicing machinery that includes U11 and U12 snRNPs.
Meisler et al. (1997) reviewed how the analysis of molecular defects in
mouse mutants can identify candidate genes for human neurologic
disorders, as illustrated by Scn8a among other genes.

Sprunger et al. (1999) studied the mouse mutant med(J), which contains a
splice site mutation in the neuronal sodium channel Scn8a that results
in a very low level of expression. On the C57BL/6J genetic background,
med(J) homozygotes exhibited progressive paralysis and juvenile
lethality. The C3H genetic background had an ameliorating effect,
producing viable adults with a novel dystonic phenotype. The dystonic
mice exhibited movement-induced, sustained abnormal postures of the
trunk and limbs. Sprunger et al. (1999) mapped a dominant modifier locus
responsible for the difference between strains to a 4.5 +/- 1.3-cM
interval on mouse chromosome 3. These findings established a role for
ion channels in dystonia and demonstrated the impact of genetic
background on its severity and progression. This new model suggested to
Sprunger et al. (1999) that SCN8A on 12q13 and SCNM1 (which by
comparative mapping is presumably located on 1p21-q21) may contribute to
human inherited dystonia.

The dystonia demonstrated by Sprunger et al. (1999) in association with
the Scn8a mutation was the first to be related to mutation in an ion
channel. Furthermore, the med(J) mouse differed from other animal models
with dystonia in that the condition persisted to adulthood and was not
associated with neurodegeneration. Sprunger et al. (1999) suggested that
the med(J) mutation should be classified as a hypomorphic allele because
a low level of full-length Scn8a transcripts was demonstrated in
homozygotes, indicating normal splicing at low efficiency. Homozygotes
for null alleles of Scn8a could not survive even in the presence of 2
copies of the Scnm1(H) modifier allele. Thus, prevention of paralysis
and survival to adulthood required both a low level of wildtype
transcript and at least 1 copy of the dominant allele of Scnm1. C57BL/6J
carries a recessive allele of Scmn1 that, in combination with a
hypomorphic level of Scn8a, resulted in paralysis and lethality.

DeRepentigny et al. (2001) described a spontaneous autosomal recessive
mutation in the mouse, which they termed 'degenerating muscle' (dmu),
that is characterized by skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration. Dmu
mice are weak and have great difficulty in moving due to muscle atrophy
and wasting in the hindquarters. Histopathologic observations and
ultrastructural analysis revealed muscle degeneration in both skeletal
and cardiac muscle, but no abnormalities in sciatic nerves. Using
linkage analysis, the authors mapped the dmu locus to the distal portion
of mouse chromosome 15 in a region syntenic to human chromosome 12q13.
The human disorder scapuloperoneal myopathy (SPM; 181430) has been
linked to this region, and SPM patients with associated cardiomyopathy
have been described. Intact transcripts for Scn8a were present in dmu
mice, but their levels were dramatically reduced. Furthermore, genetic
complementation crosses between dmu and med mice revealed that they are
allelic. The authors concluded that at least a portion of the dmu
phenotype may be caused by a downregulation of Scn8a, and that SCN8A is
a candidate gene for human SPM.

Kearney et al. (2002) described a sensitive allele of the unlinked
modifier locus, Scnm1, which results in juvenile lethality in C57BL/6J
mice carrying the med(J) mutation. The modifier acts on the splicing
efficiency of the mutant splice donor site in Scn8a, and mutant mice
display either 90% or 95% reduction in the proportion of correctly
spliced mRNA, depending on modifier genotype. The abundance of the
channel protein, NaV1.6, is also reduced by an order of magnitude in
med(J) mice, resulting in delayed maturation of nodes of Ranvier, slowed
nerve conduction velocity, reduced muscle mass, and reduction of brain
metabolic activity.

Martin et al. (2007) showed that Scn8a(med) and Scn8a(med-jo) mice,
which carry the heterozygous 'jolting' point mutation, were more
resistant to pharmacologically induced seizures than wildtype
littermates, suggesting that altered Scn8a function reduces neuronal
excitability. They also showed that the seizure severity of heterozygous
Scn1a +/- mice (see Yu et al., 2006), which is a mouse model for severe
myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI; 607208), was ameliorated by the
Scn8a(med-jo) allele. Double-heterozygous Scn1a +/- and Scn8a +/(med-jo)
mice had seizure thresholds that were comparable to wildtype
littermates, and the Scn8a(med-jo) allele was also able to rescue the
premature lethality of Scn1a +/- mice and extended the life span of
Scn1a -/- mice. The authors hypothesized that the opposing effects of
Scn1a and Scn8a dysfunction on seizure thresholds result from
differences in the cell types that are influenced by the respective
sodium channel subtypes. Scn1a mutants result in reduced sodium currents
in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons of the hippocampus and cortex,
whereas Scn8a mutants affect excitatory pyramidal cells of the
hippocampus and cortex, suggesting that reduced excitability of these
cells may underlie the elevated seizure resistance of Scn8a-mutant mice.
Martin et al. (2007) suggested that their results demonstrated that
genetic interactions can alter seizure severity, and supported the
hypothesis that genetic modifiers, including the SCN8A gene, contribute
to the clinical variability observed in SMEI and GEFS+.

By ENU-induced mutagenesis screen in mice, Papale et al. (2009)
generated a val929-to-phe (V929F) mutation in the Scn8a gene. This
residue in the pore loop of domain 2 is evolutionarily conserved.
Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed well-defined spike-wave discharges
(SWD), the hallmark of absence epilepsy (see 600131), in
V929F-heterozygous mice and in mice heterozygous for either the
Scn8a(med) or Scn8a(med-jo) mutations. Genetic background had a
significant effect on SWD, with mutants on the C3HeB/FeJ strain showing
a higher incidence than on C57BL/6J. Papale et al. (2009) suggested that
the SCN8A gene may be a candidate gene for absence epilepsy in humans.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT WITH OR WITHOUT CEREBELLAR ATAXIA
SCN8A, 2-BP DEL, 5157CT

In a 9-year-old boy with mental retardation, pancerebellar atrophy, and
ataxia (614306), Trudeau et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a
2-bp deletion in exon 4 of the SCN8A gene, which introduced a
translation termination codon into the pore loop of domain 4, resulting
in removal of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and predicting loss of
channel function (pro1719argfsX6). Three additional heterozygous family
members exhibited milder cognitive and behavioral deficits including
attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 143465). Trudeau et al.
(2006) noted that it was unclear whether the relatives of the proband
had a milder version of the neurologic abnormalities seen in the proband
due to haploinsufficiency for SCN8A, or if the proband's symptoms were
caused by an unrelated developmental disorder.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 13
SCN8A, ASN1768ASP

In a girl with infantile epileptic encephalopathy-13 (EIEE13; 614558),
Veeramah et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous 5302A-G
transition in the SCN8A gene, resulting in an asn1768-to-asp (N1768D)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in the final transmembrane
segment adjacent to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The mutation was
identified by whole-genome sequencing. Expression of the mutant protein
in a neuronal cell line showed that it caused persistent sodium
currents, incomplete channel inactivation, and a depolarizing shift in
the voltage dependence of steady-state fast inactivation. Current-clamp
analysis in rat hippocampal neurons transfected with the mutant protein
showed increased spontaneous firing, paroxysmal-depolarizing-shift-like
complexes, and an increased firing frequency, consistent with a dominant
gain-of-function phenotype. All of these studies were consistent with
neuronal hyperexcitability. Whole-genome sequencing also identified
putative recessive variants in the NRP2 (602070) and UNC13C (614568)
genes in the proband, which may have contributed to the phenotype. The
patient developed refractory generalized seizures at age 6 months. At
age 4 years, the seizure phenotype changed to epileptic spasms, followed
by regression of speech and language skills. She also had developmental
delay, intellectual disability, autism, hypotonia, and difficulties with
coordination and balance. Initial electroencephalogram (EEG) showed
bifrontal spikes and brief bursts of generalized spike-wave activity.
Later EEG showed diffuse slowing, multifocal spikes, and frontally
predominant generalized spikes. Brain MRI was normal. The patient died
suddenly at age 15 years. There was no family history of a similar
disorder.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 13
SCN8A, LEU1290VAL

In a boy with EIEE13 (614558), Carvill et al. (2013) identified a
heterozygous c.3868C-G transversion in the SCN8A gene, resulting in a
leu1290-to-val (L1290V) substitution. The patient had onset of seizures
at age 18 months. The mutation was inherited from the father, who was
found to be somatic mosaic for the mutation.

;;KINESIN 1 HEAVY CHAIN; KNS1;;
KINESIN, HEAVY CHAIN, UBIQUITOUS; UKHC;;
KINH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Kinesins are microtubule-based motor proteins involved in the transport
of organelles in eukaryotic cells. They typically consist of 2
identical, approximately 110- to 120-kD heavy chains, such as KIF5B, and
2 identical, approximately 60- to 70-kD light chains. The heavy chain
contains 3 domains: a globular N-terminal motor domain, which converts
the chemical energy of ATP into a motile force along microtubules in 1
fixed direction; a central alpha-helical rod domain, which enables the 2
heavy chains to dimerize; and a globular C-terminal domain, which
interacts with light chains and possibly an organelle receptor (summary
by Navone et al. (1992) and Niclas et al. (1994)).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on a
conserved region of the Drosophila and squid kinesin heavy chains
(KHCs), Navone et al. (1992) isolated cDNAs encoding KNS1. The predicted
963-amino acid protein has 63% sequence identity to the Drosophila KHC.
Immunoblot analysis using antibodies against squid KHC detected a 120-kD
protein in CV-1 monkey kidney epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence
studies showed that KNS1 expressed in CV-1 cells had both a diffuse
distribution and a filamentous staining pattern that coaligned with
microtubules but not vimentin (VIM; 193060) intermediate filaments; the
KNS1 N- and C-terminal domains, but not the alpha-helical rod domain,
also colocalized with microtubules.

By Northern blot analysis, Niclas et al. (1994) demonstrated that Ukhc
was expressed as multiple transcripts in all rat tissues examined.
Immunoblot analysis of rat tissue extracts using antibodies specific for
UKHC detected a 120-kD protein in all examined tissues. Niclas et al.
(1994) found that UKHC is distributed uniformly between the cell body
and processes of cultured hippocampal neurons.

MAPPING

Niclas et al. (1994) stated that the placenta UKHC cDNA isolated by
Navone et al. (1992) hybridizes to a region on mouse chromosome 18 that
shows homology of synteny with human 18q. However, Gross (2013) mapped
the human KIF5B gene to chromosome 10p11.22 based on an alignment of the
KIF5B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC126279) with the genomic sequence
(GRCh37).

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF5B belongs to the
kinesin-1 family.

GENE FUNCTION

Kamal et al. (2000) demonstrated that the axonal transport of APP in
neurons is mediated by the direct binding of APP to the kinesin light
chain (600025) subunit of kinesin-I. Kamal et al. (2001) identified an
axonal membrane compartment that contains APP, beta-secretase (604252),
and presenilin-1 (104311). The fast anterograde axonal transport of this
compartment is mediated by APP and kinesin-I. Proteolytic processing of
APP can occur in the compartment in vitro and in vivo in axons. This
proteolysis generates amyloid-beta and a carboxy-terminal fragment of
APP, and liberates kinesin-I from the membrane. Kamal et al. (2001)
concluded that APP functions as a kinesin-I membrane receptor, mediating
the axonal transport of beta-secretase and presenilin-1, and that
processing of APP to amyloid-beta by secretases can occur in an axonal
membrane compartment transported by kinesin-I.

Kanai et al. (2004) found that the hinge and C-terminal tail regions of
Kif5a (602821), Kif5b, and Kif5c (604593) bound a large
detergent-resistant RNase-sensitive granule from mouse brain. Mass
spectrometric analysis showed that the granule contained mRNAs for
Camk2-alpha (CAMK2A; 114078) and Arc (NOL3; 605235) and 42 proteins,
including those for RNA transport, protein synthesis, and translational
silencing. The granule localized to dendrites and underwent
bidirectional movement. Distally directed movement of the granule was
enhanced by Kif5 overexpression and reduced by Kif5 functional blockage.
Kanai et al. (2004) concluded that kinesins transport RNA in dendrites
via this large granule.

Kural et al. (2005) used fluorescence imaging with 1-nanometer accuracy
(FIONA) to analyze organelle movement by conventional kinesin and
cytoplasmic dynein (see 600112) in a cell. They located a green
fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged peroxisome in cultured Drosophila S2
cells to within 1.5 nanometers in 1.1 milliseconds, a 400-fold
improvement in temporal resolution, sufficient to determine the average
step size to be approximately 8 nanometers for both dynein and kinesin.
Furthermore, Kural et al. (2005) found that dynein and kinesin do not
work against each other in vivo during peroxisome transport. Rather,
multiple kinesins or multiple dyneins work together, producing up to 10
times the in vitro speed.

To determine the effects of tau (157140) on dynein and kinesin motility,
Dixit et al. (2008) conducted single-molecule studies of motor proteins
moving along tau-decorated microtubules. Dynein tended to reverse
direction, whereas kinesin tended to detach at patches of bound tau.
Kinesin was inhibited at about a tenth of the tau concentration that
inhibited dynein, and the microtubule-binding domain of tau was
sufficient to inhibit motor activity. The differential modulation of
dynein and kinesin motility suggests that microtubule-associated
proteins (MAPs) can spatially regulate the balance of
microtubule-dependent axonal transport.

Metzger et al. (2012) identified the microtubule-associated protein MAP7
(604108) and KIF5B as essential, evolutionarily conserved regulators of
myonuclear positioning in Drosophila and cultured mammalian myotubes.
Metzger et al. (2012) found that these proteins interact physically and
that expression of the KIF5B motor domain fused to the MAP7
microtubule-binding domain rescues nuclear positioning defects in
MAP7-depleted cells. This suggested that MAP7 links KIF5B to the
microtubule cytoskeleton to promote nuclear positioning. Finally,
Metzger et al. (2012) showed that myonuclear positioning is
physiologically important. Drosophila ensconsin (ens; homolog of MAP7)
mutant larvae have decreased locomotion and incorrect myonuclear
positioning, and these phenotypes are rescued by muscle-specific
expression of ens. Metzger et al. (2012) concluded that improper nuclear
positioning contributes to muscle dysfunction in a cell-autonomous
fashion.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Kull et al. (1996) reported the crystal structure of the human kinesin
motor domain with bound ADP. The motor consists primarily of a single
alpha/beta arrowhead-shaped domain. It has striking structural
similarity to the core of the catalytic domain of the actin-based motor
myosin, although kinesin and myosin have virtually no amino acid
sequence identity and exhibit distinct enzymatic and motile properties.

Mori et al. (2007) developed 2 different single-molecule fluorescence
resonance energy transfer sensors to detect whether kinesin is bound to
its microtubule track by 1 or 2 heads. Their FRET results indicated
that, while moving in the presence of saturating ATP, kinesin spends
most of its time bound to the microtubule with both heads. However, when
nucleotide binding becomes rate-limiting at low ATP concentrations,
kinesin waits for ATP in a one-head-bound state and makes brief
transitions to a 2-head-bound intermediate as it walks along the
microtubule. On the basis of these results, Mori et al. (2007) suggested
a model for how transitions in the ATPase cycle position the 2 kinesin
heads and drive their hand-over-hand motion.

Pernigo et al. (2013) presented the crystal structure of the
tetratricopeptide repeat domain of kinesin light chain-2 (611729) in
complex with a cargo peptide harboring a tryptophan-acidic motif derived
from SKIP (609613), a critical host determinant in Salmonella
pathogenesis and a regulator of lysosomal positioning. Structural data
together with biophysical, biochemical, and cellular assays allowed
Pernigo et al. (2013) to propose a framework for intracellular transport
based on the binding by kinesin-1 of W-acidic cargo motifs through a
combination of electrostatic interactions and sequence-specific
elements, providing direct molecular evidence of the mechanisms for
kinesin-1:cargo recognition.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (1998) disrupted the mouse kif5B gene by homologous
recombination. The kif5B -/- mice were embryonic lethal with a severe
growth retardation at 9.5 to 11.5 days postcoitum. To analyze the
significance of this conventional kinesin heavy chain in organelle
transport, the authors studied the distribution of major organelles in
the extraembryonic cells. The null mutant cells impaired lysosomal
dispersion, while brefeldin A could normally induce the breakdown of
their Golgi apparatus. More prominently, their mitochondria abnormally
clustered in the perinuclear region. This mitochondrial phenotype was
reversed by an exogenous expression of KIF5B, and a subcellular
fractionation revealed that KIF5B was associated with mitochondria.
These data indicated that kinesin is essential for mitochondrial and
lysosomal dispersion rather than for the Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum
traffic in these cells.

147572	TITLE *147572 INTERFERON-ALPHA-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN 6; IFI6
;;INTERFERON-INDUCED PROTEIN IFI-6-16; IFI616;;
G1P3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential screening of an alpha-interferon (IFNA; 147660)-induced
neuroblastoma cell cDNA library, followed by screening an IFNA-treated
Daudi lymphoblastoid cell cDNA library, Kelly et al. (1986) cloned IFI6,
which they called 6-16. The deduced 130-amino acid protein is
hydrophobic and contains an N-terminal signal peptide.

GENE FUNCTION

Kelly et al. (1986) showed that IFI6 was induced in HeLa cells by IFNA
and IFNB (147640). Following transfection in mouse cells, human IFI6 was
expressed in response to mouse Ifna and Ifnb, but not Ifng (147570),
with the same kinetics and dose response as in human cells.

Itzhaki and Porter (1991) reported a method for targeted disruption of
the IFI6 gene and detection by secretion of human growth hormone (GH1;
139250).

Cheriyath et al. (2007) showed that treatment of human myeloma cells
with IFN-alpha-2b (see IFNA2; 147562) for 24 hours antagonized TRAIL
(TNFSF10; 603598)-mediated apoptosis, but after 72 hours it augmented
TRAIL apoptotic activity. The antiapoptotic activity of IFN-alpha-2b was
associated with increased expression of G1P3. Ectopically expressed G1P3
localized to mitochondria and antagonized TRAIL-mediated mitochondrial
potential loss, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. Conversely, RNA
interference-mediated downregulation of G1P3 restored
IFN-alpha-2b-induced apoptosis. Cheriyath et al. (2007) concluded that
curtailing G1P3-mediated antiapoptotic signals may improve therapies for
myeloma and other malignancies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kelly et al. (1986) determined that the IFI6 gene contains 5 exons and
has a TATA box upstream of the transcription initiation site.

Porter et al. (1988) described the interferon response element of the
human IFI6 gene.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Clauss et al. (1990) mapped the IFI6
gene to chromosome 1.

Itzhaki et al. (1992) reported that the IFI6 gene maps to chromosome
1p35, based on the work of others using fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Itzhaki et al. (1992) used telomere-associated chromosome
fragmentation (TACF), a novel approach for chromosome mapping based on
the nontargeted introduction of clone telomeres into mammalian
chromosomes, to target telomeric DNA to the IFI6 gene on chromosome 1p.
They deduced that the IFI6 gene is oriented away from the centromere by
targeting telomeric DNA to the specific locus by homologous
recombination, using a selection strategy that imposed the requirement
that the telomeric DNA be oriented in the same direction as the IFI6
gene.

614386	TITLE *614386 PROLINE-RICH TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 2; PRRT2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chen et al. (2011) identified PRRT2 within a region of chromosome 16
linked to the paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia locus (EKD1; 128200).
The deduced 340-amino acid protein has a proline-rich domain in its
N-terminal half and 2 transmembrane domains in its C-terminal half.
RT-PCR of mouse tissues detected high Prrt2 expression in brain and
spinal cord, with negligible expression in all other tissues examined.
Prrt2 expression in mouse was low prior to embryonic day 16, after which
it increased, peaked at postnatal day 14, and declined in adult. RT-PCR
and in situ hybridization of postnatal day-14 mouse brain revealed high
Prrt2 expression in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, with
enrichment in cortical layers of cerebral cortex, as well as in granule
cells and Purkinje cell layers of cerebellum. Fluorescence-tagged PRRT2
was expressed in the membrane of transfected COS-7 cells.

Heron et al. (2012) found that Prrt2 was widely expressed in the mouse
brain, with high expression in the cerebral cortex and lower expression
in the basal ganglia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2011) determined that the PRRT2 gene contains 4 exons, the
first of which is noncoding.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (2011) stated that the PRRT2 gene maps to chromosome
16p11.2.

GENE FUNCTION

In HEK293T cells and brain extracts from mice, Lee et al. (2012)
demonstrated that the PRRT2 protein interacted with SNAP25 (600322), a
synaptosomal membrane. After transfection of PRRT2 into rat hippocampal
cells, PRRT2 was detected in thin axonal processes exiting from the
neuron cell bodies.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 8 unrelated Han Chinese families with episodic
kinesigenic dyskinesia-1 (EKD1; 128200), Chen et al. (2011) identified 3
different heterozygous truncating mutations in the PRRT2 gene
(614386.0001-614386.0003). The first mutation was found by exome
sequencing of a large 4-generation family with 17 affected individuals.
Expression of a truncated form of PRRT2 in COS-7 cells showed loss of
membrane targeting and localization of the truncated protein in the
cytoplasm, suggesting interruption of protein function.

Using a combination of exome sequencing and linkage analysis in 2 large
Han Chinese families with EKD1, Wang et al. (2011) independently and
simultaneously identified 2 different heterozygous truncating mutations
in the PRRT2 gene (649dupC, 614386.0001 and Q163X, 614386.0009,
respectively) that completely segregated with the phenotype in each
family. Two patients in each family also had infantile convulsion and
choreoathetosis syndrome (ICCA; 602066). Analysis of 3 additional Han
Chinese families with EKD1 revealed that 2 carried the 649dupC mutation
and 1 had a different PRRT2 mutation (614386.0010).

Heron et al. (2012) identified heterozygous mutations in the PRRT2 gene
(see, e.g., 614386.0001 and 614386.0004-614386.0006) in 14 (82%) of 17
families with benign familial infantile seizures-2 (BFIS2; 605751), and
in 5 (83%) of 6 families with familial infantile convulsions with
paroxysmal choreoathetosis, a familial syndrome in which infantile
seizures and an adolescent-onset movement disorder, paroxysmal
kinesigenic choreoathetosis (EKD1), cooccur. The 649dupC mutation
(614386.0001) was the most common mutation, found in affected members of
12 families with BFIS2 and in 3 families with ICCA. Overall, the 649dupC
mutation was found in 15 (79%) of the 19 families with ICCA or BFIS2
studied. The families were of different ethnic origin, including
Australasian of western European heritage, Swedish, and Israeli
Sephardic-Jewish, and there was no evidence of a common haplotype among
these families, indicating a mutation hotspot. These findings
demonstrated that mutations in PRRT2 cause both epilepsy and a movement
disorder, with obvious pleiotropy in age of expression.

Lee et al. (2012) also identified heterozygous mutations in the PRRT2
gene (see, e.g., 614386.0007 and 614386.0008) in affected members of
families with ICCA. The mutations were identified by whole-genome
sequencing of 6 well-characterized families. The findings were confirmed
by the identification of PRRT2 mutations in 24 of 25 additional families
with the disorder. The 649dupC mutation was the most common mutation.
Sanger sequencing of a third cohort of 78 probands with a less clear
clinical diagnosis found that 10 patients with familial disease and 17
with sporadic disease had the common 649dupC mutation; 1 additional
patient had a different truncating PRRT2 mutation. None of the
pathogenic alleles were found in over 2,500 control chromosomes. There
was intrafamilial variability of the phenotype. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that the mutant truncating proteins were not
expressed and did not exert dominant-negative effect on the wildtype
protein, suggesting haploinsufficiency as the pathologic mechanism.

Meneret et al. (2012) identified heterozygous mutations in the PRRT2
gene (see, e.g., 614386.0001; 614386.0011-614386.0012) in 22 (65%) of 34
patients of European descent with EKD1 or ICCA. Mutations were found in
13 (93%) of 14 familial cases and in 9 (45%) of 20 sporadic cases. There
was evidence for incomplete penetrance. The most common mutation was
649dupC, which was found in 17 of the 22 patients with PRRT2 mutations,
although this was not due to a founder effect. Compared to patients
without PRRT2 mutations, those with mutations had a slightly earlier age
at onset (median age of 15 years and 9 years, respectively), but
otherwise there were no phenotypic differences between the 2 groups.
Most of the mutations caused premature termination, leading Meneret et
al. (2012) to suggest that the disorders result from PRRT2
haploinsufficiency.

Schubert et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 649dupC mutation in the
PRRT2 gene in 39 of 49 families with BFIS2 and in 1 patient with
sporadic occurrence of the disorder (77% of index cases). Three
additional heterozygous PRRT2 mutations (see, e.g., 614386.0013;
614386.0014) were found in 3 other families with the disorder. The
patients were of German, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish origin. Some of
the families had previously been reported by Striano et al. (2006) and
Weber et al. (2004). The 649dupC mutation, which occurs in an unstable
DNA sequence of 9 cytosines, arose independently in families of
different origin. Some unaffected family members also carried the
mutation, indicating incomplete penetrance.

Ono et al. (2012) identified the 649dupC mutation in 14 of 15 Japanese
families with EKD1, some of whom also had ICCA, and in 2 Japanese
families with BFIS2. The mutation was shown to occur de novo in at least
1 family, suggesting that it is a mutation hotspot. EKD1, ICCA, and
BFIS2 segregated with the mutation even within the same family. The
findings indicated that all 3 disorders are allelic and are likely
caused by a similar mechanism.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Heron and Dibbens (2013) reviewed the role of PRRT2 in 3 common
neurologic disorders, EKD1, ICCA, and BFIS2, noting that there are no
clear genotype/phenotype correlations.

PRRT2, 1-BP DUP, 649C

In affected members of 6 unrelated Han Chinese families with episodic
kinesigenic dyskinesia-1 (EKD1; 128200), Chen et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous 1-bp duplication (649dupC) in exon 2 of the PRRT2 gene in
the proline-rich domain, resulting in a frameshift and introduction of a
stop codon 7 amino acids downstream of the insertion (Arg217ProfsTer8).
The mutation was found by exome sequencing of a large 4-generation
family with 17 affected individuals. The mutation completely segregated
with the phenotype in each family and was not found in unaffected family
members. The mutation was not found in 1,000 Han Chinese controls.
Expression of a truncated form of PRRT2 in COS-7 cells showed loss of
membrane targeting and localization of the truncated protein in the
cytoplasm. A 189-kb common haplotype flanking the mutation was found in
3 of the families, a second different haplotype was found in 2 other
families, and a third haplotype was found in the third family. Clinical
features of the proband of 1 family was described in detail. He had
onset at age 6 years of dystonic posturing of the head and arm, usually
triggered by standing up quickly. This occurred up to 10 times per day,
and lasted about 5 to 10 minutes. Brain MRI and EEG were normal at age 9
years. Treatment with carbamazepine resulted in complete symptom
resolution.

Using a combination of exome sequencing and linkage analysis in a large
Han Chinese family with EKD1, Wang et al. (2011) independently and
simultaneously identified a heterozygous 649dupC mutation in the PRRT2
gene that completely segregated with the phenotype. The mutation was
predicted to result in a truncated protein containing only 223 amino
acids and lacking the transmembrane segment. Two patients in the family
also had infantile convulsion and choreoathetosis syndrome (ICCA;
602066). Analysis of 3 additional Chinese Han families with EKD1
revealed that 2 carried the 649dupC mutation. The mutation was not found
in 500 controls. There was some phenotypic variability: the first family
had dystonia, choreoathetosis or athetosis, the second family had
predominant dystonia of the upper limbs, whereas the third had
predominant dystonia of the lower limbs.

In affected members of 3 unrelated families with familial infantile
convulsions with paroxysmal choreoathetosis, Heron et al. (2012)
identified a heterozygous 649dupC mutation. This heterozygous mutation
was also found in 12 unrelated families with benign familial infantile
seizures-2 (BFIS2; 605751). Overall, the 649dupC mutation was found in
15 (79%) of the 19 families with ICCA or BFIS2 studied. There was no
evidence of a common haplotype among these families. The PRRT2 649dupC
mutation clearly occurs at a mutation hotspot, and occurs in a
homopolymer of 9 C bases adjacent to 4 G bases. This DNA sequence has
the potential to form a hairpin-loop structure, possibly leading to
DNA-polymerase slippage and the insertion of an extra C base during DNA
replication.

Meneret et al. (2012) found that the 649dupC mutation was the most
common mutation in a cohort of patients of European descent with
EKD1/ICCA. The mutation was present in 17 of 22 patients with PRRT2
mutations. Several unaffected family members also carried the mutation,
indicating incomplete penetrance. There were at least 5 different
haplotypes with the mutation, and it was found to occur de novo in 2
patients, indicating that it is a mutation hotspot.

Schubert et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 649dupC mutation in the
PRRT2 gene in 39 of 49 families with BFIS2 and in 1 patient with
sporadic occurrence of the disorder (77% of index cases). The patients
were of German, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish origin. The 649dupC
mutation, which occurs in an unstable DNA sequence of 9 cytosines, arose
independently in families of different origin. Some unaffected family
members also carried the mutation, indicating incomplete penetrance.

Ono et al. (2012) identified the 649dupC mutation in 14 of 15 Japanese
families with EKD1, some of whom also had ICCA, and in 2 Japanese
families with BFIS2. The mutation was shown to occur de novo in at least
1 family, suggesting that it is a mutation hotspot. EKD1, ICCA, and
BFIS2 segregated with the mutation even within the same family. The
findings indicated that all 3 disorders are allelic and are likely
caused by a similar mechanism.

613771	TITLE *613771 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 205; TMEM205
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening for genes upregulated in cisplatin-resistant human cancer
cell lines compared with parental cell lines, Shen et al. (2010) cloned
TMEM205. The deduced 189-amino acid protein has 4 transmembrane domains.
Quantitative real-time PCR detected variable TMEM205 expression in all
29 human tissues examined, with highest expression in pancreas, followed
by adrenal gland, thyroid, liver, mammary gland, prostate, kidney, and
retina. Lowest expression was detected in skeletal muscle. Western blot
analysis detected TMEM205 at an apparent molecular mass of about 21 kD
in membrane fractions of early cisplatin-resistant cells. Immunoelectron
microscopy showed that TMEM205 localized to cell surface microvilli.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses, Shen et al. (2010) confirmed that
expression of TMEM205 was upregulated in cisplatin-resistant human and
mouse cells compared with parental cell lines. Transfection of TMEM205
into naive cells induced cisplatin resistance. Development of cisplatin
resistance was associated with reduced intracellular cisplatin levels
and redistribution of TMEM205 from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi
region. Shen et al. (2010) hypothesized that TMEM205 may be a cisplatin
transporter that permits drug resistance by reducing the intracellular
cisplatin concentration.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the TMEM205 gene to chromosome 19p13.2 based on an
alignment of the TMEM205 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY358949) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;SCD1;;
DELTA-9-DESATURASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD; EC 1.14.99.5) is an iron-containing enzyme
that catalyzes a rate-limiting step in the synthesis of unsaturated
fatty acids. The principal product of SCD is oleic acid, which is formed
by desaturation of stearic acid. The ratio of stearic acid to oleic acid
has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation
through effects on cell membrane fluidity and signal transduction. Four
SCD isoforms, Scd1 through Scd4, have been identified in mouse. In
contrast, only 2 SCD isoforms, SCD1 and SCD5 (608370), have been
identified in human. SCD1 shares about 85% amino acid identity with all
4 mouse SCD isoforms, as well as with rat Scd1 and Scd2. In contrast,
SCD5 shares limited homology with the rodent SCDs and appears to be
unique to primates (Zhang et al. (1999); Wang et al., 2005).

CLONING

Thiede et al. (1986) isolated cDNAs encoding rat Scd. By RT-PCR of
adipose tissue RNA with primers based on the sequence of rat Scd, Li et
al. (1994) isolated a partial human SCD cDNA. Using RNase protection
assays, the authors found that human SCD was expressed at higher levels
in colon and esophageal carcinomas than in the counterpart normal
tissues.

Zhang et al. (1999) cloned additional cDNAs corresponding to the
full-length human SCD transcript, which differed at 15 positions from
that of Li et al. (1994), leading to 6 predicted amino acid changes.
Zhang et al. (1999) reported that the deduced 359-amino acid SCD protein
contains the 3 highly conserved histidine-containing regions that are
essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity. The coding region of
human SCD shares 85% and 82% nucleotide identity with those of mouse
Scd1 and Scd2, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that SCD is
expressed ubiquitously as 3.9- and 5.2-kb mRNAs, with the highest levels
in brain and liver. The 2 transcripts arise from use of alternative
polyadenylation signals.

GENE FUNCTION

By stable expression of SCD antisense cDNA in transformed human lung
fibroblasts, Scaglia and Igal (2005) found that SCD depletion led to
decreased synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids and phospholipids and
promoted accumulation of saturated fatty acid-enriched unesterified
fatty acids and triacylglycerol. Concomitantly, SCD deficiency led to
reduced cell proliferation, loss of anchorage-independent growth, and
increased sensitivity to ceramide-independent apoptosis. Cells
expressing low SCD levels were more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects
of exogenous palmitic acids. Because the effects of SCD deficiency were
not reversed by the addition of exogenous oleic acid, Scaglia and Igal
(2005) concluded that endogenous synthesis of monounsaturated fatty
acids is essential in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis.

Using a mouse model of BCR (151410)/ABL (189980)-induced chronic myeloid
leukemia, Zhang et al. (2012) found that expression of Scd1 was
downregulated in leukemia stem cells. Knockdown of Scd1 in
BCR/ABL-expressing mouse leukemia stem cells downregulated expression of
apoptosis-related genes. Scd1 expression was induced by a PPAR-gamma
(PPARG; 601487) agonist, resulting in reduced proliferation of leukemia
stem cells. Scd1 appeared to have no effect on proliferation or
apoptosis of normal hematopoietic stem cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (1999) demonstrated that the human SCD gene spans
approximately 24 kb and contains 6 exons. They noted that the human,
mouse, and rat SCD genes show similar organizations.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Zhang et al. (1999) mapped
the SCD gene to chromosome 10 and a transcriptionally inactive,
processed SCD pseudogene to chromosome 17.

Wang et al. (2005) stated that the mouse Scd1, Scd2, Scd3, and Scd4
genes map within a 200-kb stretch on chromosome 19 and are likely
derived from tandem duplication events. Since no other SCD genes map to
human chromosome 10, Wang et al. (2005) suggested that a gene
duplication event similar to that resulting in the mouse Scd genes did
not occur in humans.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Suhre et al. (2011) reported a comprehensive analysis of
genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using a GWAS with nontargeted
metabolomics. They identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood
metabolite concentrations, of which 25 showed effect sizes that were
unusually high for GWAS and accounted for 10 to 60% differences in
metabolite levels per allele copy. These associations provided new
functional insights for many disease-related associations that had been
reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and
kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism,
and Crohn disease. Suhre et al. (2011) identified dbSNP rs603424 in the
SCD gene as associated with myristate/myristoleate ratio with a p value
of 2.9 x 10(-57).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zheng et al. (1999) identified deletions in the Scd1 gene in the asebia
(ab) mutant mouse, which has rudimentary sebaceous glands and develops
alopecia.

Miyazaki et al. (2000) found that asebia (Scd1 -/-) mice had decreased
levels of liver cholesterol esters and triglycerides, despite high
activities of Acat (see ACAT1; 607809) and Gpat (GPAM; 602395), the
enzymes that catalyze synthesis of cholesterol esters and triglycerides,
respectively. Additionally, ad libitum access of Scd1 -/- mice to diets
rich in oleate and palmitoleate did not restore their hepatic
cholesterol esters and triglycerides to the levels found in normal mice.
Miyazaki et al. (2000) concluded that Scd1 has an important role in
cholesterol and lipoprotein homeostasis.

To examine the mechanism underlying the metabolic actions of leptin
(164160), Cohen et al. (2002) used transcription profiling to identify
leptin-regulated genes in ob/ob liver. Leptin was found to specifically
repress RNA levels and enzymatic activity of SCD, which catalyzes the
biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. Mice lacking Scd1 were lean
and hypermetabolic; ob/ob mice with mutations in Scd1 were significantly
less obese than ob/ob controls and had markedly increased energy
expenditure. Ob/ob mice with mutations in Scd1 had histologically normal
livers with significantly reduced triglyceride storage and VLDL
production. Cohen et al. (2002) concluded that downregulation of Scd1 is
an important component of leptin's metabolic actions.

SCD is a central lipogenic enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of
monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly oleate (C18:1) and palmitoleate
(C16:1), which are components of membrane phospholipids, triglycerides,
wax esters, and cholesterol esters. Several SCD isoforms (Scd1, -2, and
-3) exist in the mouse. Ntambi et al. (2002) showed that mice with a
targeted disruption of the Scd1 isoform had reduced body adiposity,
increased insulin (176730) sensitivity, and resistance to diet-induced
weight gain. The protection from obesity involved increased energy
expenditure and increased oxygen consumption. Compared with wildtype
mice, the Scd1 -/- mice had increased levels of plasma ketone bodies but
reduced levels of plasma insulin and leptin. In these homozygous null
mice, the expression of several genes of lipid oxidation was
upregulated, whereas lipid synthesis genes were downregulated. These
observations suggested that a consequence of Scd1 deficiency is an
activation of lipid oxidation in addition to reduced triglyceride
synthesis and storage.

Miyazaki et al. (2003) found that liver X receptor-alpha (NR1H3; 602423)
agonists and a high carbohydrate fat-free diet induced Scd4 expression
in mice, but unlike Scd1, Scd4 expression was not repressed by dietary
polyunsaturated fatty acids. Scd4 mRNA expression was elevated 5-fold in
the hearts of leptin (164160)-deficient ob/ob mice relative to wildtype
controls. Treatment of ob/ob mice with leptin decreased Scd4 mRNA
levels, but did not affect Scd1 or Scd2 mRNA levels. Scd4 mRNA levels
were induced 3-fold in the hearts of Scd1-deficient mice.

Miyazaki et al. (2005) found that Scd2 expression was high in mouse
livers between embryonic day 18.5 and 21 days of age and decreased in
adult mice. In contrast, Scd1 expression was induced after weaning.
Miyazaki et al. (2005) found that Scd2 knockout was embryonic lethal in
some mice depending upon the genetic background. In a strain able to
tolerate Scd2 deletion, newborn Scd2-null mice were smaller than
wildtype littermates, and a few hours after birth their skin appeared
dry and cracked due to a permeability barrier defect. Mutant skin also
showed repartitioning of linoleic acid from epidermal acylceramide
species into phospholipids. Animals that survived to adulthood had
normal sebaceous glands and hair growth, but they had a twisted tail.

Using antisense Scd1 oligonucleotides, Gutierrez-Juarez et al. (2006)
lowered hepatic Scd1 expression and activity in rats and mice with
diet-induced insulin resistance. Insulin clamp studies revealed severe
hepatic insulin resistance in high fat-fed rats and mice that was
completely reversed by 5 days of treatment with antisense Scd1.
Downregulation of Scd1 in mice also decreased glucose production (by
about 75%), gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis. Downregulation of Scd1
led to increased Akt (AKT1; 164730) phosphorylation and decreased
expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC; 613742) and
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1; 261680). Gutierrez-Juarez et
al. (2006) concluded that Scd1 is required for the onset of diet-induced
hepatic insulin resistance.

Lam et al. (2007) found that intracerebroventricular administration of
glucose in rats lowered circulating triglycerides through inhibition of
VLDL secretion by the liver. The effect of glucose required its
conversion to lactate, leading to activation of ATP-sensitive potassium
channels and to decreased hepatic Scd1 activity. Injection of a
sequence-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide decreased the hepatic
activity of Scd1 and recapitulated the effects of central glucose
administration on VLDL secretion, and portal infusion of oleic acid
negated the effects of both central glucose and Scd1 deficiency on VLDL
secretion. These central effects of glucose, but not those of lactate,
were rapidly lost in diet-induced obese rats. Lam et al. (2007)
suggested that a defect in brain glucose sensing might play a critical
role in the etiology of the metabolic syndrome.

609238	TITLE *609238 RAB GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1-LIKE; RABGAP1L
;;TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 18; TBC1D18;;
KIAA0471
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Seki et al. (1997) cloned RABGAP1L, which they designated
KIAA0471. The transcript contains an Alu element in the 3-prime UTR. The
deduced protein contains 370 amino acids. SDS-PAGE detected RABGAP1L at
an apparent molecular mass of about 50 kD.

Using RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al. (1997) found ubiquitous RABGAP1L
expression. Highest expression was in placenta, liver, kidney, and small
intestine, and lowest expression was in skeletal muscle and spleen.

Hidaka et al. (2000) cloned mouse Rabgap1l, which they designated Hhl.
The deduced 298-amino acid protein contains a PTB domain and shares
homology with the N terminus of human GAPCENA (RABGAP1). Northern blot
analysis detected several Rabgap1l transcripts expressed in a
tissue-specific manner. In situ hybridization of day-14.5 embryos
revealed expression in heart and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

By differential display, Sharma et al. (2003) found that RABGAP1L
expression was upregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas
compared with matched normal esophageal epithelial tissue. In
particular, RABGAP1L expression was upregulated in esophageal tumors
showing nodal invasion.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the RABGAP1L
gene to chromosome 1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Most patients with Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) are considered
sporadic late-onset cases with a complex etiology. By differential
display RT-PCR analysis, De Yebra et al. (2004) found inhibition of
RABGAP1L expression in medial septum and hippocampus in 3 of 6 AD
patients, including 1 with a PSEN1 (104311) mutation.

614983	TITLE *614983 BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, ATF-LIKE 2; BATF2
;;SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIVATOR PROTEIN 1, REGULATED BY INTERFERON; SARI;;
SUPPRESSOR OF AP1, REGULATED BY IFN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BATF2 downregulates cell growth by inhibiting the transcriptional
activity of activator protein-1 (AP1; see 165160), an important
regulator of cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation (Su et al.,
2008).

CLONING

Using differential expression analysis to identify genes upregulated by
interferon (IFN)-beta (147640) in human melanoma cells, Su et al. (2008)
identified BATF2, which they called SARI. The deduced 274-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 29.4 kD. SARI has an
N-terminal basic region, followed by an L-X(6)-L-X(6)-L-X(6)-L motif,
suggesting that it may be a basic leucine zipper-containing
transcription factor. Northern blot analysis of 23 human tissues and
peripheral blood leukocytes detected highest SARI expression in pancreas
and spleen. Expression was moderate in colon, heart, kidney, liver,
lung, and prostate, low in placenta, stomach, small intestine, and
salivary gland, and absent in several tissues, including brain, muscle,
and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Su et al. (2008) found that INF-beta-induced expression of SARI or
overexpression of SARI in AP1-dependent human cancer cell lines
inhibited clonogenic cell growth and anchorage-independent growth and
induced apoptosis. SARI overexpression also inhibited tumor formation by
AP1-dependent DU-145 prostate cancer cells in xenografts in athymic nude
mice. In contrast, overexpression of SARI in normal human cells had no
effect on cell growth or viability. Knockdown of SARI in HeLa cells
abrogated IFN-beta-induced growth inhibition. Using protein interaction
reporter gene assays, Su et al. (2008) found that SARI inhibited
AP1-dependent cell growth by binding to JUN and blocking interaction of
AP1 with DNA, thereby inhibiting AP1-dependent gene expression.

CCN1 (CYR61; 602369) is a secretory integrin-binding protein that
regulates angiogenesis, cell adhesion, migration, proliferation,
survival, and apoptosis. Dash et al. (2010) showed that, by inhibiting
binding of AP1 to the CCN1 promoter, overexpression of SARI reduced CCN1
mRNA and protein expression, which attenuated CCN1-dependent downstream
signaling via ERK (see 176948) and AKT (see 164730)/PI3 kinase (see
601232) pathways.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; 608232) is a common malignancy
characterized by expression of the fused oncogene BCR (151410)-ABL
(189980). BCR-ABL shows constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and
induces growth factor-independent cell growth via several signaling
pathways, including JAK (see 147795)/STAT (see 600555), PI3 kinase/AKT,
and RAS (190020)/MAPK. Huang et al. (2011) showed that SARI expression
was suppressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CML patients
compared with normal controls. Knockdown of BCR-ABL via small
interfering RNA (siRNA) in primary CML cells or K562 myelogenous
leukemia cells upregulated SARI expression. Treatment of cells with
inhibitors of JAK/STAT or RAS/MAPK, but not of PI3 kinase, also resulted
in SARI upregulation. Treatment of K562 cells with siRNA against SARI
decreased apoptosis induced by a BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, suggesting
that SARI inhibits tumor cell growth by promoting apoptosis.

BATF3 (612470) is required for homeostatic development of CD8-alpha
(CD8A; 186910)-positive classical dendritic cells that prime CD8 T-cell
responses against intracellular pathogens. Tussiwand et al. (2012)
identified an alternative, Batf3-independent pathway in mice for
Cd8-alpha-positive dendritic cell development operating during infection
with intracellular pathogens and mediated by the cytokines
interleukin-12 (IL12; 161560) and interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). This
alternative pathway resulted from molecular compensation for Batf3
provided by the related AP1 factors Batf (612476), which also functions
in T and B cells, and Batf2 induced by cytokines in response to
infection. Reciprocally, physiologic compensation between Batf and Batf3
also occurred in T cells for expression of Il10 (124092) and Ctla4
(123890). Compensation among BATF factors was based on the shared
capacity of their leucine zipper domains to interact with non-AP1
factors such as Irf4 (601900) and Irf8 (601565) to mediate cooperative
gene activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Su et al. (2008) determined that the BATF2 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Su et al. (2008) mapped the BATF2 gene to
chromosome 11q12-q13.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The covalent conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins regulates diverse
cellular pathways and proteins. Ubiquitin is transferred to a target
protein through a concerted action of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme
(E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), such as UBE2T, and a
ubiquitin ligase (E3) (Machida et al., 2006).

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned UBE2T, which they designated HSPC150, from
CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The deduced
197-amino acid protein contains a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme active
site. EST database analysis indicated widespread UBE2T expression.

Machida et al. (2006) found homologs of UBE2T in only vertebrate
databases.

GENE FUNCTION

Machida et al. (2006) found that UBE2T is essential for the Fanconi
anemia pathway for the efficient repair of damaged DNA. UBE2T bound to
the C-terminal PH domain of FANCL (PHF9; 608111), the ubiquitin ligase
subunit of the Fanconi anemia core complex, leading to the
monoubiquitination of FANCD2 (227646). DNA damage in UBE2T-depleted
human osteosarcoma cells led to the formation of abnormal chromosomes
that are a hallmark of Fanconi anemia. Machida et al. (2006) also found
that UBE2T undergoes automonoubiquitination in vivo. This
monoubiquitination was stimulated by the presence of FANCL and
inactivated UBE2T. UBE2T activity was dependent on the conserved cys86,
where a ubiquitin molecule is transferred from E1, and UBE2T underwent
automonoubiquitination at lys91 in vivo. The monoubiquitination of UBE2T
occurred even in the absence of an E3 in vitro. Machida et al. (2006)
concluded that UBE2T is the E2 in the Fanconi anemia pathway and has a
self-inactivation mechanism that could be important for negative
regulation of the pathway.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2000) determined that the UBE2T gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Zhang et al. (2000)
mapped the UBE2T gene to chromosome 1q31.

606132	TITLE *606132 CDC42 EFFECTOR PROTEIN 2; CDC42EP2
;;CEP2;;
BINDER OF RHO GTPases 1; BORG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDC42 (116952), a small RHO GTPase, regulates the formation of
F-actin-containing structures through its interaction with several
downstream effector proteins. These effectors include the CEPs, also
called the BORGs, all of which contain a CDC42/RAC (602048) interactive
binding (CRIB) motif. The CDC42EP2 gene encodes a CDC42 effector protein
(summary by Hirsch et al., 2001).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen on a mouse embryo cDNA library with TC10
(605857) as the bait, followed by EST database searching, Joberty et al.
(1999) identified cDNAs encoding human and mouse BORG1 (CEP2), BORG2
(CEP3; 606133), BORG3 (CEP5), BORG4 (CEP4; 605468), and BORG5 (CEP1).
Sequence analysis predicted that the 210-amino acid BORG1 protein
contains a CRIB motif followed by a conserved 12-residue BORG homology-1
(BH1) domain in its N terminus; an 11-amino acid BH2 domain in its
central region; and a 22-residue BH3 domain in its C terminus. Northern
blot analysis detected ubiquitous but variable expression of 1.8- and
2.0-kb BORG1 transcripts, with high levels in heart and low levels in
pancreas and liver. By binding analysis, Joberty et al. (1999) confirmed
that BORG1 interacts with TC10 and CDC42. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated cytoplasmic expression of BORG1. BORG1 expression caused no
dramatic changes in cell shape and a reduced abundance of stress fibers.
Coexpression of BORG1 with CDC42 resulted in cells showing a 'porcupine'
phenotype characterized by an abundance of actin-filled spikes.

By EST database searching with CEP1 as the probe, Hirsch et al. (2001)
identified cDNAs encoding several CEPs, including CEP2. They referred to
the BH2 and BH3 domains as CI and CII, respectively, and considered the
BH1 domain to be part of an extended CRIB motif. Hirsch et al. (2001)
proposed that these motifs are potential signaling domains. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated cytoplasmic and membrane expression of CEP2 in
keratinocytes, with notable localization in a perinuclear cytoplasmic
compartment.

MAPPING

Scott (2001) mapped the CEP2 gene to 11q12-q13 based on identity between
the CEP2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF098290) and a chromosome 11 clone
(GenBank GENBANK AC000353).

610701	TITLE *610701 HEAT-SHOCK 70-KD PROTEIN 12A; HSPA12A
;;KIAA0417
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned HSPA12A, which they designated
KIAA0417. The deduced protein contains 710 amino acids. RT-PCR analysis
detected highest HSPA12A expression in brain, followed by kidney,
testis, and ovary. Little to no expression was detected in other tissues
examined. In vitro translated HSPA12A had an apparent molecular mass of
73 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Han et al. (2003) cloned mouse Hspa12a. The deduced 675-amino acid
protein has an atypical HSP70 (see HSPA1A; 140550) ATPase domain, which
is in 2 parts separated by a 66-amino acid spacer region. Han et al.
(2003) identified human HSPA12A by database analysis. The 675-amino acid
human protein shares 96% identity with mouse Hspa12a and 60% identity
with human HSPA12B (610702). Northern blot analysis of human tissues
detected highest expression of a 6.5-kb transcript in brain, with
progressively lower levels in kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart. Mouse
Hspa12a showed a similar expression pattern, but it was not expressed in
skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Han et al. (2003) found that Hspa12a was more highly expressed in
elicited peritoneal macrophages from an atherosclerosis-sensitive mouse
strain than in those from an atherosclerosis-resistant strain, and both
Hspa12a and Hspa12b were preferentially expressed in lesional portions
of aorta. In situ hybridization confirmed that Hspa12a and Hspa12b were
expressed in lesions, but not in normal nonlesional aortic tissue.

GENE STRUCTURE

Han et al. (2003) determined that the HSPA12A gene contains 12 exons and
has a long 3-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the HSPA12A
gene to chromosome 10. Han et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Hspa12a gene
to chromosome 19.

;;SAC DOMAIN-CONTAINING INOSITOL PHOSPHATASE 2; SAC2;;
KIAA0966
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned INPP5F, which they designated
KIAA0966. The transcript contains an Alu element in the 3-prime
untranslated region, and the deduced protein contains 1,132 amino acids.
RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate to high expression in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in whole adult brain, testis, and
ovary, and all specific adult brain regions examined. Whole fetal brain
expressed a somewhat lower level of expression than that found in the
adult brain.

By examining the INPP5F protein sequence, Minagawa et al. (2001)
identified 7 motifs conserved in SAC domain-containing proteins of
different species, including the active site Cx(5)R(T/S) motif in the
sixth motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.9-kb transcript in all
human tissues tested, with highest expression in brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Minagawa et al. (2001) found that human INPP5F expressed in insect cells
showed 5-phosphatase activity against phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, similar to that of
type II phosphatases. It did not hydrolyze other inositol phosphates.
High activity was maintained between pH 5.5 and 8.0, with maximal
activity at pH 6.0. Activity was increased in the presence of Mg(2+) and
K+, but not Mn(2+), Ca(2+), or EDTA.

MAPPING

The Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the INPP5F gene to
chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-22037).

606615	TITLE *606615 HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR 1-ALPHA INHIBITOR; HIF1AN
;;HIF1A INHIBITOR;;
FACTOR-INHIBITING HIF1A; FIH1
DESCRIPTION Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activates transcription of genes whose
protein products either increase oxygen availability by promoting
erythropoiesis (see EPO; 133170) and angiogenesis (see VEGF; 192240) or
mediate adaptive responses to oxygen deprivation, such as increased
glycolytic metabolism. HIF1A (603348), whose expression is regulated by
cellular oxygen concentration, is part of a heterodimer with the
constitutively expressed HIF1B (ARNT; 126110). The C-terminal half of
HIF1A contains multiple regulatory domains that interact with specific
proteins, such as VHL (608537).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library with
transactivating domain C (TAD-C) and the inhibitory domain of HIF1A as
bait, Mahon et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding HIF1AN, which they
designated FIH1. EST database analysis suggested that HIF1AN is
expressed in multiple cell types. The deduced 349-amino acid HIF1AN
protein is homologous to rat Pass1 and to fly and worm sequences,
indicating evolutionary conservation of this protein family.

GENE FUNCTION

By binding analyses of truncated HIF1AN peptides, Mahon et al. (2001)
showed that the inhibitory domain rather than the transactivating
domains of HIF1A interacts with HIF1AN, although the presence of TAD-C
optimizes binding. Functional analysis indicated that HIAF1AN inhibits
HIF1A transcriptional activity in hypoxic and nonhypoxic cells. Further
binding analysis determined that the N terminus of HIF1AN interacts with
the N terminus of VHL, and that both interact with HIF1A at distinct
sites (VHL with TAD-N of HIF1A), allowing the formation of ternary
complexes of the 3 proteins. VHL, but not HIF1AN, interacts with and
recruits HDAC1 (601241), HDAC2 (605164), and HDAC3 (605166) to HIF1A,
thus functioning as a HIF1A corepressor. Mahon et al. (2001) proposed
that HIF1AN may instead interact, either directly or indirectly, with
other functionally and structurally distinct histone deacetylases.

Using mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Hoff et al.
(2013) found that the ciliary proteins ANKS6 (615370), NPHP3 (608002),
INVS (243305), and NEK8 (609799) interacted in a complex. ANKS6 also
interacted with HIF1AN (606615). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments
showed that HIF1AN facilitated formation of a complex containing rat
Anks6 and human NPHP3 and INVS. Association of rat Anks6 with human NEK8
required hydroxylation of Anks6. Hoff et al. (2013) concluded that
oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of ANKS6 by HIF1AN regulates the
composition of the ANKS6-containing ciliary complex.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Mahon et al. (2001) determined that the
HIF1AN gene contains 8 exons and spans 14 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Mahon et al. (2001) mapped the HIF1AN gene
to chromosome 10q24, a region deleted in gliomas in which increased
HIF1A-mediated transactivation of downstream genes, such as VEGF,
occurs.

601572	TITLE *601572 CAPPING PROTEIN, BETA; CAPZB
;;CAP PROTEIN, ACTIN, BETA; CAPPB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CapZ was identified in chicken as an actin-binding protein composed of
alpha (see 601580) and beta subunits. From a human retina cDNA library,
Barron-Casella et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs homologous for the beta
subunit of chicken CapZ.

MAPPING

Barron-Casella et al. (1995) mapped the CAPZB gene to chromosome 1p36.1
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

HISTORY

In the course of mapping 39 ESTs on chromosome 6p24-p23, Olavesen et al.
(1997) concluded that CAPZB is located in that region flanked by EDN1
(131240) on the centromeric side and TFAP2 (107580) on the telomeric
side. However, Cooper (1999) stated that a 'simple clerical error'
occurred at the outset of this project; the EST in question does not
share sequence similarity with the CAPZB gene and, therefore, the
mapping of the CAPZB gene to chromosome 6p24-p23 is incorrect.

;;1-@PYRROLINE-5-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHETASE; PYCS;;
P5CS;;
GLUTAMATE GAMMA-SEMIALDEHYDE SYNTHETASE; GSAS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) catalyzes the ATP- and
NADPH-dependent conversion of L-glutamate to glutamic
gamma-semialdehyde, which is the metabolic precursor for proline
biosynthesis.

CLONING

By a method they referred to as 'database cloning,' Aral et al. (1996)
isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding the human P5CS gene.

Hu et al. (1999) observed that mammalian P5CS undergoes alternative
splicing to generate 2 isoforms differing only by a 2-amino acid insert
at the N terminus of the gamma-glutamyl kinase active site. The short
isoform has high activity in the gut, where it participates in arginine
biosynthesis and is inhibited by ornithine. The long isoform, expressed
in multiple tissues, is necessary for the synthesis of proline from
glutamate and is insensitive to ornithine.

MAPPING

Jones (1975) presented evidence from cell hybrid studies that the
structural gene for the enzyme converting glutamate to its gamma
semialdehyde is located on chromosome 10. The fact that
glutamate-gamma-semialdehyde synthetase (GSAS) and glutamate
oxaloacetate transaminase (138180) are in the same biochemical pathway
and determined by genes on the same chromosome may have biologic
significance (Jones, 1975).

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Liu et al. (1996) mapped the PYCS
gene to 10q24.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Baumgartner et al. (2000) observed homozygosity for a missense mutation
in P5CS in the 2 sibs described by Rabier et al. (1992) with mental
retardation, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, cataract, and
metabolic abnormalities, including hyperammonemia, hypoprolinemia,
hypocitrullinemia, and hypoornithinemia (ARCL3A; 219150). The
arg84-to-gln mutation (R84Q; 138250.0001) alters a conserved residue in
the P5CS gamma-glutamyl kinase domain and dramatically reduces the
activity of both P5CS isoforms when expressed in mammalian cells.
Additionally, R84Q appears to destabilize the long isoform.

In affected individuals from a New Zealand family with mental
retardation, joint hypermobility, and skin laxity without metabolic
abnormalities, Bicknell et al. (2008) identified a homozygous mutation
in the ALDH18A1 gene (H784Y; 138250.0002). In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the H784Y mutant protein retained
normal P5CS activity and did not impair proline synthesis. The findings
indicated that impaired enzymatic activity does not account for the
phenotype, as was suggested for the patients reported by Baumgartner et
al. (2000).

Skidmore et al. (2011) reported a child born of a consanguineous union
with features consistent with De Barsy syndrome (ARCL3A) with homozygous
mutation in the ALDH18A1 gene (138250.0003).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA

Baumgartner et al. (2000) determined that the 2 sibs reported by Rabier
et al. (1992) with mental retardation, joint hypermobility, skin laxity,
cataracts, and metabolic abnormalities (219150) were homozygous for a
251G-A transition of the PYCS gene, resulting in an arg84-to-gln (R84Q)
substitution. The mutation impairs the function of both the long and
short isoforms of PYCS.

.0002
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, HIS784TYR

In 4 affected sibs, born of consanguineous New Zealand Maori parents,
with mental retardation, joint hypermobility, skin laxity without
metabolic abnormalities (219150), Bicknell et al. (2008) identified a
homozygous 2350C-T transition in exon 18 of the ALDH18A1 gene, resulting
in a his784-to-tyr (H784Y) substitution in a conserved residue in the
C-terminal motif. In vitro functional expression studies indicated that
the H784Y-mutant protein retained normal P5CS activity and did not
impair proline synthesis. The findings indicated that impaired enzymatic
activity does not account for the phenotype.

.0003
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, NT1923, G-A, +1

In a severely affected child with clinical features consistent with De
Barsy syndrome (219150), born to consanguineous parents of Pakistani
origin, Skidmore et al. (2011) reported homozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the exon 14-intron 14 boundary (nucleotide 1923+1) of the
ALDH18A1 gene. The mutation resulted in 2 anomalous transcripts that
were predicted to encode proteins lacking the catalytic site for the
enzyme. The cellular phenotype was characterized by diminished
production of collagens type I (see 120150) and III (see 120180),
altered elastin ultrastructure, and diminished cell proliferation of
cultured dermal fibroblasts. The child had lax, wrinkled, and thin skin
with dilated and tortuous subcutaneous blood vessels, corneal clouding,
and hypotonia. The child also had severe global developmental delay and
feeding difficulties, and died in infancy of unknown causes.

602409	TITLE *602409 MYELOID/LYMPHOID OR MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA, TRANSLOCATED TO, 10; MLLT10
;;ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 10; AF10
AF10/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
AF10/HEAB FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Translocations affecting chromosome 11q23 involve many partner
chromosome regions and occur in various leukemias (see 600328). The
11q23 gene involved in the translocations is MLL (159555). Using RACE to
identify MLL fusion transcripts in RNA from 2 leukemia patients, Chaplin
et al. (1995) identified the partner gene involved in t(10;11)(p12;q23)
translocations. In both patients, the translocation fused MLL to a gene
that the authors designated AF10. The AF10 gene encodes a predicted
1,027-amino acid protein containing an N-terminal zinc finger and a
C-terminal leucine zipper domain that are highly homologous to similar
domains in AF17 (600328) and BR140 (602410). Northern blot analysis
showed that AF10 is expressed as a 5.5-kb mRNA in many tissues with
highest expression in testis, and has an alternatively spliced exon.

GENE FUNCTION

The AF10 gene is one of the few MLL partner genes to be independently
rearranged with a third gene in leukemia, the CALM gene (603025) in the
t(10;11)(p12;q14) translocation (Dreyling et al., 1996). Chimeric fusion
proteins MLL/AF10 and CALM/AF10 consistently retain the leucine zipper
motif of AF10. Debernardi et al. (2002) used this part of the C-terminal
region as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screening of a testis cDNA library.
They found that the leucine zipper interacted with GAS41 (602116), a
protein previously identified as the product of an amplified gene in a
glioblastoma. GAS41 shows significant homology to the human MLL fusion
partners AF9 (159558) and ENL (159556). The study also showed that GAS41
interacts with integrase interactor-1 (INI1; 601607) and that INI1 is a
component of the SWI/SNF complex (see 604958), which acts to remodel
chromatin and to modulate transcription. Retention of the leucine zipper
in the MLL and CALM fusions suggested that a key feature of these
chimeric proteins may be their ability to interfere in normal gene
regulation through interaction with the adenosine triphosphate-dependent
chromatin remodeling complexes.

MAPPING

Chaplin et al. (1995) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
AF10 gene to 10p12.

CYTOGENETICS

- AF10/MLL Fusion Gene

Chaplin et al. (1995) found that all known translocations involving MLL
and AF10 or AF17 have involved breakpoints between the zinc finger and
leucine zipper domains, and have yielded fusion proteins in which the
MLL zinc fingers were replaced with leucine zipper regions. Chaplin et
al. (1995) speculated that the fusion proteins may participate in
abnormal heterodimers.

- AF10/HEAB Fusion Gene

Tanabe et al. (1996) identified an invins(10;11)(p12;q23q12) and other
complex chromosomal rearrangements in a 2-year old boy with acute
monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5). Cloning of the proximal 10p breakpoint
showed that the MLL gene at chromosome 11q23 was fused to the 3-prime
portion of AF10 at chromosome 10p12. Cloning of the telomeric 10p
junction revealed that the 5-prime portion of AF10 was fused with the
HEAB gene (608757). The 5-prime AF10/HEAB fusion transcript was out of
frame, while the MLL/3-prime AF10 transcript was in frame.

MLLT10 gene and susceptibility to meningioma, see 607174.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterases (EC 3.1.2.2), such as ACOT7, are found
in all organisms and cleave fatty acyl-CoAs into free fatty acids and
CoA.

CLONING

Engberg et al. (1997) purified a liver cytosolic isoform of long-chain
acyl-CoA thioesterase from peroxisome proliferator-treated rats and
named it CTE-II for 'cytosolic long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase.'
Antibodies against CTE-II were used to screen an expression library of
peroxisome proliferator-induced rat liver cDNA. The predicted 338-amino
acid protein migrated at 40 kD on SDS-PAGE. Engberg et al. (1997)
observed many evenly distributed nucleotide differences and pronounced
differences in the C-terminal regions between CTE-II and the closely
related ACT (602586) and suggested that the 2 enzymes are encoded by
different genes. Engberg et al. (1997) noted that there are human ESTs
homologous to CTE-II.

Yamada et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs encoding long-chain acyl-CoA
hydrolases from rat brain and liver cDNA libraries and designated the
clones Bach and Lach, respectively. Since the nucleotide sequences of
the N-terminal regions were entirely different but the downstream
sequences were virtually identical, Yamada et al. (1997) suggested that
Bach and Lach are derived from the same gene by alternative splicing.

Using a rat Bach cDNA to screen a human brain cDNA library, Yamada et
al. (1999) cloned BACH. The deduced protein contains 338 amino acids and
shares 95% identity with rat Bach. Northern blot analysis detected a
1.9-kb BACH transcript in human brain RNA. Biochemical analysis of human
brain homogenates showed that BACH is a cytosolic enzyme. SDS-PAGE
detected BACH at 43 kD, but gel filtration detected BACH at about 100
kD, indicating that the protein forms multimers.

By 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR of human brain total RNA, Yamada et al.
(2002) identified 6 BACH splice variants. Four variants, designated
BACHa to BACHd, differ in their use of 1 of 4 alternate first exons
(exons 1a through 1d, respectively) and encode proteins of 329 to 380
amino acids. All 4 of these proteins contain the hydrolase domain and a
bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in their C-terminal halves,
and BACHb and BACHc have N-terminal mitochondrial localization signals.
The 2 remaining variants contain exon X, an alternatively spliced exon
between exons 7 and 8 that causes a frameshift and introduces a
premature stop codon. These C-terminally truncated proteins of 246 and
283 amino acids lack the hydrolase domain and NLS. The BACH proteins
containing the mitochondrial localization signal were detected in
mitochondria of transfected mouse neuroblastoma cells, but those
containing only the NLS did not localize to nuclei, even though the
isolated NLS was functional when fused to a test protein.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human brain detected BACHa in the
cytosol of neurons such as pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and
Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. In mouse brain, Bacha was also
detected in nuclei as well as cytosol of certain large neurons in the
cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. Yamada et al. (2002)
suggested that the NLS of BACH may be masked by the full-length protein
as a regulatory mechanism.

GENE FUNCTION

Yamada et al. (1997) found that bacterial extracts of E. coli expressing
either rat Bach or Lach cDNAs had 100-fold higher acyl-CoA hydrolase
activity, demonstrating that both cDNAs encode long-chain acyl-CoA
hydrolases.

By analyzing the activity of purified BACH against several fatty
acyl-CoAs, Yamada et al. (1999) found that BACH showed a relatively
broad specificity, with acyl-CoAs with carbon chains of C8 to C18 being
good substrates. BACH activity was inhibited by a sulfhydryl blocking
agent. Recombinant BACH was also active against palmitoyl-CoA.

Yang et al. (2004) found significantly decreased levels of acyl-CoA
hydrolase in hippocampal tissue from 5 patients with mesial temporal
lobe epilepsy (608096) compared to controls.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yamada et al. (2002) determined that the ACOT7 gene contains 13 exons,
including 4 alternative first exons (exons 1a through 1d) and exon X, an
alternatively spliced exon between exons 7 and 8. The gene spans 129 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Yamada et al. (1999) mapped the ACOT7 gene
to chromosome 1p36.2. Hunt et al. (2005) stated that the human ACOT7
gene maps to chromosome 1p36.31-p36.11 and the mouse Acot7 gene maps to
chromosome 4E2.

NOMENCLATURE

Hunt et al. (2005) noted that acyl-CoA thioesterases are referred to in
the literature as acyl-CoA hydrolases, but the reaction catalyzed is the
cleavage of a thioester bond. They presented a revised nomenclature for
these enzymes using the name acyl-CoA thioesterase and the root gene
symbol ACOT.

600756	TITLE *600756 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-PRIME; PPP2R4
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-PRIME;;
PHOSPHOTYROSYL PHOSPHATASE ACTIVATOR; PTPA;;
PR53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PPP2R4, or PTPA, encodes a specific phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator
of the dimeric form of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) (Van
Hoof et al., 1995).

GENE FUNCTION

The core component of PP2A consists of a catalytic (C) subunit (e.g.,
PPP2CA; 176915) and a scaffold protein (A) subunit (e.g., PPP2R1A;
605983). Using purified recombinant proteins, Chao et al. (2006) found
that PTPA and PP2A A-C dimers constituted a composite ATPase, and the
interaction was independent of ATP or magnesium ion. The inclusion of
PTPA altered the substrate specificity of PP2A, with enhanced
phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and decreased phosphoserine
phosphatase activity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Chao et al. (2006) reported the 1.9-angstrom crystal structure of human
PTPA, which revealed a fold consisting of a core, a lid, and an extended
linker joining the core and lid. Structural analysis uncovered a highly
conserved surface patch bordering these 3 subdomains, as well as an
associated deep pocket between the core and linker subdomains. Further
analysis showed that the surface patch binds the PP2A A-C dimer, and the
deep pocket binds ATP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van Hoof et al. (1995) demonstrated that human PTPA is encoded by a
single-copy gene composed of 10 exons and 9 introns with a total length
of about 60 kb. The 5-prime flanking sequence of the transcription start
site was analyzed for its potential as a promoter. This region lacks a
TATA sequence in the appropriate position relative to the transcription
start. However, this region is very GC-rich and contains 4 Sp1 sites
(SP1; 189906) upstream of the transcription start site, a feature common
to many TATA-less promoters. Based on homology with DNA-binding
consensus sequences of transcription factors, Van Hoof et al. (1995)
identified several additional putative transcription factor binding
sites in the promoter region. Transfection experiments with a construct
containing the PTPA promoter region inserted 5-prime of a luciferase
reporter gene demonstrated that the 5-prime flanking sequence of the
PTPA gene indeed has promoter activity that seems to be cell-line
dependent.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Van Hoof et al. (1995) mapped the
PTPA gene to 9q34. Fluorescence in situ analysis of metaphase
chromosomes of patients bearing the Philadelphia chromosome indicated
that PTPA is positioned centromeric of ABL1 (189980) and probably is not
involved in chronic myeloid leukemia.

609433	TITLE *609433 UBIQUITIN INTERACTION MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; UIMC1
;;RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 80-KD; RAP80
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display of RNA expressed by young proliferating and
senescent normal human epidermal keratinocytes, followed by screening a
testis cDNA library, Yan et al. (2002) cloned RAP80. The deduced
719-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 79.6 kD. The
N-terminal half of RAP80 contains 2 nuclear localization signals and a
putative ubiquitin interaction motif. The C-terminal half contains a
potential PEST sequence, 2 zinc fingers, and a third nuclear
localization signal. Northern blot analysis detected a major 2.6-kb
transcript expressed highly in testis and moderately in ovary, thymus,
and heart. In situ hybridization of mouse testis detected Rap80
associated with germ cells, with little expression in surrounding Leydig
cells. No significant differences in the level of Rap80 were found
between developmental subpopulations of germ cells, suggesting that
Rap80 expression is not developmentally regulated. Immunofluorescence
localization detected RAP80 in a speckled nuclear distribution in a
transfected monkey kidney cell line, and mutation analysis indicated
that the second nuclear localization signal directed intracellular
localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Yan et al. (2002) found that RAP80 decreased basal transcription of a
reporter gene in transfected Chinese hamster ovary and monkey kidney
cell lines. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis indicated that RAP80 could interact
with the retinoid-related testis-associated receptor (RTR; 602778), but
not with retinoid receptors (see RXRA; 180245) or other nuclear
receptors tested. Cotransfection experiments showed that RAP80 and RTR
interacted with each other in a dose-dependent manner. Mutation analysis
indicated that several regions of RAP80 were important for optimal
interaction with RTR. RAP80 inhibited the interaction of NCOR (600849)
with RTR in a concentration-dependent manner, and RAP80 and NCOR
appeared to compete with each other for RTR binding.

Wang et al. (2007) showed that Abraxas (ABRA1; 611143), a protein that
binds BRCA1 (113705), recruits the ubiquitin-interacting motif
(UIM)-containing protein RAP80 to the BRCA1 complex. Both Abraxas and
RAP80 were required for DNA damage resistance, G2/M checkpoint control,
and DNA repair. RAP80 was required for optimal accumulation of BRCA1 on
damaged DNA (foci) in response to ionizing radiation, and the UIM
domains alone were capable of foci formation. Wang et al. (2007)
concluded that the RAP80-Abraxas complex may help recruit BRCA1 to DNA
damage sites in part through recognition of ubiquitinated proteins.

Sobhian et al. (2007) reported the interaction of the BRCT (BRCA1
C-terminal) BRCA1 domain with the ubiquitin-binding protein RAP80. RAP80
targets a complex containing the BRCA1-BARD1 (601593) E3 ligase and the
deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC36 (300617) to MDC1 (607593)-gamma-H2AX
(601772)-dependent lys6- and lys63-linked ubiquitin polymers at
double-strand breaks. Sobhian et al. (2007) stated that these events are
required for cell cycle checkpoint and repair responses to ionizing
radiation, implicating ubiquitin chain recognition and turnover in the
BRCA1-mediated repair of double-strand breaks.

Kim et al. (2007) independently reported the identification of AP80 as a
BRCA1-interacting protein in humans. RAP80 contains a tandem UIM domain,
which is required for its binding with ubiquitin in vitro and its
damage-induced foci formation in vivo. Moreover, Kim et al. (2007)
showed that RAP80 specifically recruits BRCA1 to DNA damage sites and
functions with BRCA1 in G2/M checkpoint control. Kim et al. (2007)
concluded that taken together, their results suggested the existence of
a ubiquitination-dependent signaling pathway involved in the DNA damage
response.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yan et al. (2002) determined that the RAP80 gene contains 15 exons and
spans more than 90 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Yan et al. (2002) mapped the UIMC1 gene to chromosome 5q35.

;;ICOS LIGAND; ICOSL; LICOS;;
B7 HOMOLOG 2; B7H2;;
GL50;;
B7-RELATED PROTEIN 1; B7RP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The costimulatory B7 molecules (e.g., B7-1, or CD80; 112203) signal
through CD28 (186760) family molecules, such as CD28, CTLA4 (123890),
and ICOS (604558). By searching sequence databases for human homologs of
the mouse B7-like gene Gl50, Ling et al. (2000) identified a brain cDNA,
KIAA0653 (Ishikawa et al., 1998), containing similar as well as
unrelated sequences. Using 3-prime RACE analysis of peripheral blood
leukocytes (PBLs) and RT-PCR of leukocyte RNA, Ling et al. (2000)
isolated a cDNA encoding a 309-amino acid human B7 homolog, which they
termed GL50, that is 42% identical to the mouse sequence. Northern blot
analysis detected highest expression of 2.4-, 3.0-, and 7.0-kb
transcripts in brain, heart, kidney, and liver, with lower expression in
colon and thymus. A 1.1-kb transcript was also detected in PBLs.

Yoshinaga et al. (2000) also cloned GL50, which they termed B7RP1.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 302-amino acid protein contains a
transmembrane domain and 5 conserved cysteine residues.

Wang et al. (2000) also cloned this gene, which they termed B7H2.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 302-amino acid type I glycoprotein
is 21% identical to B7H1 (605402).

GENE FUNCTION

By flow cytometric analysis, Ling et al. (2000) demonstrated that mouse
Gl50 binds to Icos but not to Ctla4 or Cd28.

BIAcore analysis by Yoshinaga et al. (2000) indicated that B7RP1 binds
preferentially to ICOS and does not bind to CTLA4. Flow cytometric
analysis demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (191160) enhances
B7RP1 expression on B cells and monocytes, but decreases its expression
on dendritic cells. B7RP1 fusion protein or cells expressing B7RP1
enhanced T-cell proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680)-dependent
cytokine production (gamma-interferon (147570) and IL10 (124092) but not
IL2) in response to anti-CD3 (see 186740) stimulation. This enhancement
could be blocked by soluble ICOS.

Flow cytometric analysis by Wang et al. (2000) demonstrated enhanced
B7H2 surface expression on dendritic cells stimulated with
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF; 138960) and IL4
(147780), but not on those stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Wang et
al. (2000) found that B7H2 costimulation enhances production of IL10 and
IL2 but that this varies with anti-CD3 concentration.

In mice, Xu et al. (2013) showed that Icos directly controls follicular
recruitment of activated T-helper cells in mice. This effect is
independent from ICOS ligand (ICOSL)-mediated costimulation provided by
antigen-presenting dendritic cells or cognate B cells, and does not rely
on Bcl6 (109565)-mediated programming as an intermediate step. Instead
it requires ICOSL expression by follicular bystander B cells, which do
not present cognate antigen to T-helper cells but collectively form an
ICOS-engaging field. Dynamic imaging revealed that Icos engagement
drives coordinated pseudopod formation and promotes persistent T-cell
migration at the border between the T-cell zone and the B-cell follicle
in vivo. When follicular bystander B cells could not express Icosl,
otherwise competent T-helper cells failed to develop into follicular
T-helper cells normally, and failed to promote optimal germinal center
responses. Xu et al. (2013) concluded that these results demonstrated a
costimulation-independent function of ICOS and uncovered a key role for
bystander B cells in promoting the development of follicular T-helper
cells.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the ICOSLG
gene, which they called KIAA0653, to chromosome 21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mak et al. (2003) generated Icosl -/- mice by deleting the region of
Icosl encoding the IgV loop. These otherwise healthy and fertile mice
had reduced IgG1 production and affinity maturation, indicating a defect
in T cell-dependent responses. The Icosl -/- mice also had impaired T-
and B-cell interaction and germinal center formation. Adoptive transfer
experiments demonstrated that costimulation through Icos-Icosl is
pivotal in the primary, but not the secondary, phase of helper T-cell
responses. Using a model of allergic airway disease, Mak et al. (2003)
also observed lower IgE production and decreased recruitment of
inflammatory cells to the lung.

Gajewska et al. (2005) found that B7rp1-deficient mice developed airway
eosinophilia and Th2 responses, as assessed by the pattern of cytokine
and Ig production, following aerosolized ovalbumin challenge. In
addition, B7rp1-deficient mice did not develop inhalation tolerance.
Gajewska et al. (2005) concluded that the ICOS-B7RP1 pathway is
redundant for generation of Th2 responses, but it is required for
induction of inhalation tolerance.

103180	TITLE *103180 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 1; ARF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), such as ARF1, are small guanine
nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the enzymatic activities of
cholera toxin. ARFs are essential and ubiquitous in eukaryotes, being
involved in vesicular transport and functioning as activators of
phospholipase D. The functions of ARF proteins in membrane traffic and
organelle integrity are intimately tied to their reversible association
with membranes and specific interactions with membrane phospholipids. A
common feature of these functions is their regulation by the binding and
hydrolysis of GTP (summary by Bobak et al. (1989) and Amor et al.
(1994)).

CLONING

Bobak et al. (1989) cloned 2 ARF cDNAs, ARF1 and ARF3 (103190), from a
human cerebellum library. Based on deduced amino acid sequences and
patterns of hybridization of cDNA and oligonucleotide probes with
mammalian brain poly(A)+ RNA, human ARF1 is the homolog of bovine ARF1.
Human ARF3, however, appeared to represent a newly identified, third
type of ARF, which differs from bovine ARF1 and bovine ARF2. Peng et al.
(1989) also reported cloning of ADP-ribosylation factor.

Lee et al. (1992) found that human ARF1 is identical to its bovine
counterpart, has a distinctive pattern of tissue and developmental
expression, and is encoded by an mRNA of approximately 1.9 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Coatomer, or COPI (see 601924), is a heptameric protein recruited to
membranes by ARF1. Coat assembly helps in the transport of budding off
membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus.
Using fluorescence microscopy, Presley et al. (2002) showed that guanine
nucleotide exchange-activated ARF1 at the Golgi membrane recruits and
binds cytoplasmic COPI to the membranes. Photobleaching experiments
demonstrated that COPI remains at the membranes after ARF1-GTP has been
hydrolyzed by ARFGAP1 (608377). COPI binds to membrane cargo,
soluble-cargo receptors, or other Golgi proteins. Uncoating, or the
release of COPI from Golgi membranes to the cytoplasm, then occurs,
which can be inhibited by aluminum fluoride. Presley et al. (2002)
concluded from their kinetic and biochemical analyses that COPI and ARF1
continuously bind and release from Golgi membranes, allowing the
membrane at these sites to recruit cargo, alter their phospholipid
composition, and become larger, phase-separated domains.

Endocytosis of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and
the fluid phase takes place primarily through a dynamin (see DNM1;
602377)- and clathrin (see CLTC; 118955)-independent, CDC42
(116952)-regulated pinocytic mechanism. In Chinese hamster ovary cells,
Kumari and Mayor (2008) found that reduced activity or levels of Arf1
inhibited GPI-anchored protein and fluid-phase endocytosis without
affecting other clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytic pathways.
Arf1 was activated at distinct sites on the plasma membrane, and it
recruited the CDC42 GTPase-activating protein Arhgap10 (609746) to the
plasma membrane, thereby modulating cell surface Cdc42 dynamics. Kumari
and Mayor (2008) concluded that ARF1 regulates both endocytosis and
secretion and may provide a mechanism for crosstalk between these
processes.

Using a yeast genetic screen for substrates of the Shigella flexneri
type III effector protein IpaJ, Burnaevskiy et al. (2013) identified
Arf1 and Arf2 (ARF4; 601177). Mass spectrometric analysis showed that
IpaJ cleaved the peptide bond between myristoylated gly2 and asn3 of
human ARF1. Further analysis showed that IpaJ cleaved numerous
N-myristoylated proteins with various functions. Burnaevskiy et al.
(2013) concluded that IpaJ is a cysteine protease that cleaves the
N-myrisoylated glycine from ARF1, possibly as the substrate cycles
between activity-dependent conformational states. They proposed that
cleavage of lipidated proteins may be a mechanism of microbial
pathogenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Amor et al. (1994) described the 3-dimensional structure of full-length
human ARF1 in its GDP-bound nonmyristoylated form.

Mossessova et al. (1998) reported the crystal structure of the catalytic
Sec7 homology domain of ARNO (602488), a human guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) for ARF1, determined at 2.2-angstrom resolution.
The Sec7 domain is an elongated, all-helical protein with a distinctive
hydrophobic groove that is phylogenetically conserved. Structure-based
mutagenesis identifies the groove and an adjacent conserved loop as the
ARF-interacting surface. The sites of Sec7 domain interaction on ARF1
have subsequently been mapped, by protein footprinting experiments, to
the switch 1 and switch 2 GTPase regions, leading to a model for the
interaction between ARF GTPases and Sec7 domain exchange factors.

Nucleotide dissociation from small G protein-GEF complexes involves
transient GDP-bound intermediates. In the case of ARF proteins, small G
proteins that regulate membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells, such
intermediates can be trapped either by the natural inhibitor brefeldin A
or by charge reversal at the catalytic glutamate of the Sec7 domain of
their GEFs. Renault et al. (2003) reported the crystal structure of
these intermediates, which shows that membrane recruitment of ARF and
nucleotide dissociation are separate reactions stimulated by the Sec7
domain. The reactions proceed through sequential rotations of the
Arf-GDP core towards the Sec7 catalytic site, and are blocked by
interfacial binding of brefeldin A and unproductive stabilization of GDP
by charge reversal.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1992) determined that the ARF1 gene has 4 introns and spans
approximately 16.5 kb. Exon 1 (46 bp) contains only untranslated
sequence. The 5-prime flanking region has a high GC content but no TATA
or CAAT box, as found in housekeeping genes. The authors stated that the
2 human class I ARF genes, ARF1 and ARF3, have similar exon/intron
organizations and use GC-rich promoters.

MAPPING

Hirai et al. (1996) obtained an expressed sequence tag related to the
ARF1 gene and used fluorescence in situ hybridization to assign ARF1 to
1q42.

ATL-DERIVED PMA-RESPONSIVE GENE; APR;;
NOXA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify genes involved in leukemogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia
(ATL), Hijikata et al. (1990) constructed a cDNA library from an ATL
tumor cell line named IKD. By differential plaque hybridization using
P32-labeled cDNAs of poly(A+) RNA from IKD cells and a human
T-lymphotropic virus type I-infected T-cell line (C91/PL) as probes and
RNA blot analysis, Hijikata et al. (1990) obtained a cDNA clone of a
gene highly expressed in IKD cells. Expression of this gene was also
detected in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells of several ATL
patients, but not in those of healthy donors. The cDNA is 1,897 base
pairs in length, with a short open reading frame encoding a polypeptide
of 54 amino acids. Exposure of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
a T-cell lymphoma cell line (Jurkat), and quiescent human embryonic lung
cells to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) resulted in rapid,
transient expression of 2.0-kb mRNA of the gene. This induction was not
inhibited by cyclohexamide. Hijikata et al. (1990) named their gene APR
for 'ATL-derived PMA-responsive gene.' From these findings, Hijikata et
al. (1990) suggested APR as a member of the cellular
immediate-early-response genes.

The critical function of tumor suppressor p53 (191170) is the induction
of apoptosis in cells exposed to noxious stresses. Oda et al. (2000)
searched for target genes of IRF1 (147575), p53, or both that showed
increased transcription in response to DNA damage. They used an mRNA
differential display method to isolate cDNAs whose mRNA expression
profiles differed between the x-ray-irradiated wildtype and IRF1/p53
doubly deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). They identified a
gene that they called Noxa (for 'damage'). Oda et al. (2000) isolated
and characterized the mouse Noxa gene. The transcription initiation site
was determined to be 158 basepairs upstream from the initiator ATG, and
a potential p53 recognition sequence was located at -155 to -174 in the
promoter region. Its cDNA encodes a 103-amino acid protein with 2
mutually related 9-amino acid sequences characteristic to the BH3 motif
of the BCL2 family of proteins. Noxa mRNA was constitutively expressed
in small amounts in the brain, thymus, spleen, lung, kidney, and testis
of adult mice. Oda et al. (2000) screened for a human homolog of Noxa
cDNA and found that the cloned cDNA showing the highest degree of
similarity was identical to the APR gene. Human NOXA, or APR, encodes 54
amino acids, containing only 1 BH3 motif at amino acids 29 to 37. This
motif probably corresponds to the B motif of mouse Noxa, and the human
NOXA gene lacks the DNA segment corresponding to the second exon of
mouse Noxa. The promoter region of the human NOXA gene contains 1
p53-response element.

GENE FUNCTION

Oda et al. (2000) found that x-ray irradiation of wildtype MEFs
increased expression of Noxa mRNA about 5-fold, with kinetics similar to
those of the p53-dependent gene MDM2 (164785). In contrast, expression
of the Noxa gene was totally abolished in p53-deficient MEFs but not in
IRF1-deficient MEFs. When ectopically expressed, Noxa underwent BH3
motif-dependent localization to mitochondria and interacted with
antiapoptotic Bcl2 family members, resulting in the activation of
caspase-9 (602234). Human NOXA also induced apoptosis in various cells,
including Saos2 cells, in a BH3 motif-dependent manner. The introduction
of antisense oligonucleotide to NOXA inhibited p53-induced apoptosis.
Oda et al. (2000) concluded that Noxa may represent a novel mediator of
p53-dependent apoptosis.

Using a PCR-based subtractive hybridization approach, Kim et al. (2004)
found that Noxa was upregulated by hypoxia in cell lines from various
tissues in a p53-independent, Hif1a (603348)-dependent manner.
Upregulation of Noxa led to cell death by generating reactive oxygen
species (ROS) that induced cytochrome c release and caspase activation.
Induction of transient ischemia in a rat brain model, followed by TUNEL
analysis, revealed increased Noxa mRNA and protein expression and
apoptotic nuclei. The apoptosis could be reversed by liposomal delivery
of Noxa antisense oligonucleotides. Kim et al. (2004) concluded that
NOXA is an HIF1A-induced proapoptotic gene that mediates hypoxic cell
death by generation of ROS.

ANIMAL MODEL

Villunger et al. (2003) generated Noxa- and Puma- (605854) deficient
mice by targeted disruption. Null mice were born at the expected
frequency and became healthy adults. However, in both cases, there was
decreased DNA damage-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts, although only
loss of Puma protected lymphocytes from cell death. Puma deficiency also
protected cells against diverse p53-independent cytotoxic insults,
including cytokine deprivation and exposure to glucocorticoids, the
kinase inhibitor staurosporine, or phorbol ester. Villunger et al.
(2003) concluded that Puma and Noxa are critical mediators of the
apoptotic responses induced by p53 and other agents.

608879	TITLE *608879 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 13, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, C; VPS13C
;;KIAA1421
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned VPS13C, which they designated
KIAA1421. The deduced protein contains 1,463 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected VPS13C expression in all adult and fetal tissues and all
specific brain regions examined. Expression was intermediate in most
tissues, but it was lower in adult pancreas and lung and in fetal liver
and brain.

By searching databases for sequences similar to VPS13A (605978),
followed by RT-PCR of lymphoid cell line and brain RNA, Velayos-Baeza et
al. (2004) cloned VPS13C. They identified 2 main splice variants,
variant 1A and variant 2A, as well as 4 different 3-prime end splice
variants. Variant 1A encodes a deduced 3,710-amino acid protein, and
variant 2A encodes a deduced 3,753-amino acid protein. VPS13C shares
significant similarity with yeast Vps13 and other human VPS13 proteins,
mostly in the N and C termini. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of variant 1A in all tissues tested, whereas variant 2A was
expressed only in brain, although at a higher level than variant 1A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) determined that the VPS13C gene contains 86
exons, including 1 alternative exon (exon 81b), and spans 208 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the VPS13C
gene to chromosome 15. By genomic sequence analysis, Velayos-Baeza et
al. (2004) mapped the VPS13C gene to chromosome 15q21.3. They mapped the
mouse Vps13c gene to chromosome 9C.

608100	TITLE *608100 NFU1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; NFU1
;;IRON-SULFUR CLUSTER SCAFFOLD PROTEIN NFU1;;
HIRA-INTERACTING PROTEIN 5; HIRIP5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NFU1 gene encodes a protein that plays an essential role in the
production of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters for the normal maturation of
lipoate-containing 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and for the assembly of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (summary by Cameron et al.,
2011).

CLONING

Using a C-terminal fragment of HIRA (600237) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed by screening a U937
monocyte cDNA library, Lorain et al. (2001) cloned HIRIP5. The HIRIP5
cDNA contains 3 putative start methionines, resulting in deduced
proteins of 230, 196, and 169 amino acids. By searching sequence
databases, Lorain et al. (2001) identified homologs of HIRIP5 in several
species, including mouse. The 3 start codons in the human sequence are
conserved in mouse, but the first is out of frame. Translation from the
first conserved in-frame start codon in mouse yields a 199-amino acid
protein that is 97% identical to the 196-amino acid human protein.
Alignment of HIRIP5 homologs revealed a protein structure consisting of
an N-terminal domain with 5 conserved residues; a central domain with 8
conserved residues; a linker region; a C-terminal domain; and a variable
C terminus. HIRIP5 may have a mitochondrial localization signal.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.1-kb transcript in nearly all adult
and fetal tissues examined.

Tong et al. (2003) identified several clones corresponding to human NFU1
that differed from HIRIP5 in the human expressed sequence tag database.
The identified sequences extended the 5-prime sequence to include an
upstream in-frame ATG, indicating at least 2 mRNA isoforms. Exon 1
contains 2 potential 5-prime donor splice sites that are used to
generate isoform I containing exon 1A but not exon 1B, or isoform II
(HIRIP5) containing both exon 1A and exon 1B. However, exon 1B contains
a stop codon, so isoform II is initiated at a downstream codon. Isoform
I was shown to localize to mitochondria in COS-7 cells. Functional
isoform II lacks the first 24 amino acids found in isoform I and
localizes to the cytosol.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro pull-down assays of recombinant proteins, Lorain et al.
(2001) confirmed that HIRIP5 interacts with HIRA.

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, Ganesh et al. (2003) determined that
the C-terminal NifU-like domain of HIRIP5 interacts specifically with
the N-terminal CBD4 domain of laforin, encoded by the EPM2A gene
(607566). They also determined that HIRIP5 is a substrate for the
phosphatase activity of laforin.

Using biochemical and spectroscopic techniques, Tong et al. (2003)
demonstrated that NFU1 is an iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein that
assembles 1 labile 4Fe-4S cluster per 2 NFU1 monomers.

MAPPING

By radioactive in situ hybridization, Lorain et al. (2001) mapped the
HIRIP5 gene to chromosome 2p15-p13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 Mexican sibs with fatal multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions
syndrome-1 (MMDS1; 605711) originally reported by Seyda et al. (2001),
Cameron et al. (2011) identified a homozygous splice site mutation in
the NFU1 gene (608100.0001) resulting in no detectable mature protein in
patient fibroblasts. Transduction of fibroblast lines with retroviral
vectors expressing the mitochondrial, but not the cytosolic, isoform of
NFU1 corrected the defects in respiratory chain and oxoacid
dehydrogenase complex function. The results indicated that NFU1 plays an
essential role in the production of iron-sulfur clusters for the normal
maturation of lipoate-containing 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and for the
assembly of the respiratory chain complexes.

In 9 patients from unrelated Spanish families with fatal multiple
mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome-1, Navarro-Sastre et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous mutation in the NFU1 gene (G208C; 608100.0002).
Studies in yeast cells showed that it impaired NFU1 function.

MULTIPLE MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTIONS SYNDROME 1
NFU1, 545G-A

In 3 Mexican sibs with fatal multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions
syndrome-1 (MMDS1; 605711) originally reported by Seyda et al. (2001),
Cameron et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 545G-A transition in exon
6 of the NFU1 gene. Although 545G-A is predicted to result in an
arg182-to-gln (R182Q) substitution, it is also adjacent to a splice
site, and RT-PCR analysis showed that exon 6 is spliced out from the
majority of transcripts. There was no detectable mitochondrial NFU1
protein in fibroblasts of 1 of the patients. Biochemical studies of
patient fibroblasts showed a decrease in iron-sulfur cluster-containing
respiratory chain complexes and a lack of detectable lipoate in the
pyruvate dehydrogenase and oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes.
Mitochondrial, but not the cytosolic version, of NFU1 rescued the
respiratory chain and oxoacid dehydrogenase defects in immortalized
fibroblasts.

In a Spanish infant with fatal MMDS1, Navarro-Sastre et al. (2011)
identified compound heterozygosity for the 545G-A mutation and a
gly208-to-cys (G208C; 608100.0002) substitution in NFU1. Examination of
patient cells showed no mRNA expression of the 545G-A mutation,
consistent with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Expression of the mutation
in COS-7 cells showed that it caused defective splicing and the skipping
of exon 6.

.0002
MULTIPLE MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTIONS SYNDROME 1
NFU1, GLY208CYS

In 9 patients from unrelated Spanish families with fatal multiple
mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome-1 (605711), Navarro-Sastre et al.
(2011) identified a homozygous 622G-T transversion in exon 7 of the NFU1
gene, resulting in a gly208-to-cys (G208C) substitution in a highly
conserved residue close to the Fe-S cluster binding motif. The mutation
was not found in 220 controls. A tenth Spanish patient was compound
heterozygous for G208C and 545G-A (608100.0001). Four of the families
were of Basque origin, suggesting a founder effect. The patients
presented between 1 and 9 months of age with failure to thrive,
neurologic regression, or pulmonary hypertension. All died by age 15
months. Biochemical findings included increased lactate and glycine,
increased urinary 2-ketoacids, and impaired oxidation. Patient
fibroblasts showed decreased activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
(PDH) complex and liver tissue showed low activity of the glycine
decarboxylase system (238300). Muscle homogenates from patients showed
evidence of defective lipoylation and impaired synthesis of lipoic acid,
with decreased levels of PDH- and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
(AKGDH; 613022)-bound lipoic acid. NFU1 protein levels were normal. The
findings indicated that proper NFU1 activity is required for lipoic acid
synthetase (LIAS; 607031) activity. Depletion of NFU1 in HeLa cells
showed decreased levels of lipoic acid bound to E2 subunits of the PDH
complex and AKGDH, and decreased levels and activity of succinate
dehydrogenase (SDH; mitochondrial complex II; 185470). In contrast to
ISCU (611911), which plays a scaffolding role, NFU1 appears to play a
specific, auxiliary role late in the biogenesis of SDH and LIAS, 2 Fe-S
apoproteins. Transfection of the homologous G208C mutation in yeast
showed that it was functionally impaired.

;;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-LIKE 1; TCFL1;;
TRANSFORMATION SUPPRESSOR GENE YL-1; YL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Horikawa et al. (1995) followed up on previous observations that various
transformed phenotypes of Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed NIH 3T3
cells were suppressed by introduction of a normal human chromosome 1 via
microcell fusion and that revertant cells that re-acquired the
transformed phenotype commonly lost the human 1q21 and 1q23-q24 regions.
The observations had suggested the location of a transformation
suppressor gene(s) on the proximal portion of 1q. Horikawa et al. (1995)
isolated a novel human cDNA on 1q21, designated YL1, as a candidate, and
then cloned its mouse homolog. Human and mouse YL1 cDNA shared 96% amino
acid homology and presumably encoded a transcription factor-like
polypeptide. An analysis using a specific antibody demonstrated nuclear
localization of YL1 protein. The bacterially expressed YL1 could bind to
DNA. Thus, the YL1 protein possibly functions as a transcriptional
regulator.

Cai et al. (2005) stated that the YL1 protein contains 364 amino acids
and that it is highly conserved from humans to yeast.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cox et al. (2001) determined that the YL1 gene contains 6 coding exons
spanning 14.2 kb and intergenically splices into TMOD4 (605834). The
last exon of YL1 is 291 bp from a 5-prime untranslated exon of TMOD4.
Cox et al. (2001) also found that YL1 undergoes unconventional splicing
using noncanonical splice sites within exons to produce several
alternative transcripts.

MAPPING

Horikawa et al. (1995) identified the YL1 gene on chromosome 1q21.

GENE FUNCTION

Cai et al. (2005) demonstrated that epitope-tagged YL1 associated with
proteins of the TRRAP (603015)/TIP60 (HTATIP; 601409) histone
acetyltransferase complex in transfected HeLa cells. In addition, YL1
was part of a subset of proteins that also functioned as subunits of the
SWI2/SNF2 (SMARCA2; 600014)-related CBP (CREBBP; 600140) activator
protein (SRCAP) chromatin remodeling complex.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DPEP1 (EC 3.4.13.11) is a kidney membrane enzyme that hydrolyzes a
variety of dipeptides and is implicated in renal metabolism of
glutathione and its conjugates, e.g., leukotriene D4 (Kozak and Tate,
1982). DPEP1 is responsible for hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring of
antibiotics, such as penem and carbapenem (Campbell et al., 1984).
Earlier, beta-lactamase enzymes were thought to occur only in bacteria,
where their probable function was in protecting the organisms against
the action of beta-lactam antibiotics. These antibiotics exhibit
selective toxicity against bacteria but virtual inertness against many
eukaryotic cells (Adachi et al., 1990).

CLONING

Adachi et al. (1990) isolated and characterized cDNA clones for human
DPEP1, which they called RDP. DNA and RNA blot analysis indicated the
existence of a single gene.

To isolate potential tumor/growth suppressor genes involved in Wilms
tumor, Austruy et al. (1993) constructed a cDNA library by cloning a
mature kidney cDNA subtracted with an excess of Wilms tumor mRNA. Clones
were selected according to a differential pattern of expression, i.e.,
positive with RNA from mature kidney and negative with RNA from several
Wilms tumors. By comparison of sequences of these clones with database
sequences, 1 clone was identified as DPEP1.

Nitanai et al. (2002) stated that RDP is a homodimer of identical
369-amino acid subunits. Each subunit has a calculated molecular mass of
about 42 kD, but N-glycosylation at 4 possible sites results in a highly
glycosylated peptide of about 63 kD. In addition, each RDP subunit has a
C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor.

Habib et al. (2003) cloned mouse Dpep1, which they designated Mbd1.
Northern blot analysis detected 3 transcripts that were differentially
expressed in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, and testis. No
Mbd1 expression was detected in brain and spleen. The transcripts likely
arise from the use of alternate poly(A) sites and variations in the
5-prime UTR.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nitanai et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure of human RDP.
Each subunit appears to assume a barrel shape made up of 8 alpha helix
and beta sheet pairs. Each monomer requires 2 zinc ions that are ligated
to the catalytic residues (glu125, his198, and his219) at the bottom of
the enzymatic pocket. His152 is not ligated to zinc, but it is
responsible for recognition of a substrate or inhibitor. The pocket is
reinforced by 2 adjacent disulfide bonds and by 3 proline residues.
Cys361 is involved in a disulfide bridge between monomers.

GENE FUNCTION

Kera et al. (1999) measured dipeptidase activity in several human
postmortem tissues and in rat tissues using glycyl-D-alanine as
substrate. Highest activity in human tissues was detected in kidney
cortex, pancreas, and testis. Much lower activity was detected in
adrenal gland and liver, and very low activity was detected in lung,
spleen, cerebrum, and cerebellum. The enzyme was also found in serum and
urine from healthy volunteers. Activity in rats was similar, but was
much higher in lung. The distribution of enzyme activity in various
tissues changed in postnatal rats up to 8 weeks of age.

Habib et al. (2003) demonstrated that COS-7 cells transfected with mouse
Mbd1 were able to convert leukotriene D4 to leukotriene E4 and could
hydrolyze cystinyl-bis-glycine (cys-bis-gly) and beta-lactam. Inhibition
of Mbd1 by penicillamine indicated that it is a metallopeptidase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Satoh et al. (1993) determined that the DPEP1 gene contains 10 exons and
spans about 6 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nakagawa et al. (1991) mapped the RDP gene to chromosome 16q24.

Austruy et al. (1993) used somatic cell hybrids carrying either
different human chromosomes or chromosome 16 segments to confirm and
refine the physical mapping of DPEP1 to 16q24.3. Two RFLPs were
described and used to show linkage of DPEP1 to D16S7; maximum lod score
was 5.8 at theta of 0.03.

ANIMAL MODEL

Habib et al. (1998) found that Mbd1-deficient mice retained partial
ability to degrade cys-bis-gly and to convert leukotriene D4 to
leukotriene E4 depending on the tissue examined. Habib et al. (2003)
suggested that tissue- and substrate-specific activities of Mbd2 (DPEP2;
609925) and Mbd3 (DPEP3; 609926) partially compensate for the loss of
Mbd1 in these mice.

604267	TITLE *604267 MULTIPLE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE DOMAINS 8; MEGF8
;;EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE 4, FORMERLY; EGFL4, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The domain that characterizes epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)
consists of approximately 50 amino acids with 3 disulfide bonds.
EGF-like domains are believed to play a critical role in a number of
extracellular events, including cell adhesion and receptor-ligand
interactions. Proteins with EGF-like domains often consist of more than
1,000 amino acids, have multiple copies of the EGF-like domain, and
contain additional domains known to be involved in specific
protein-protein interactions. To identify proteins containing EGF-like
domains, Nakayama et al. (1998) searched a database of long cDNA
sequences randomly selected from a human brain cDNA library for those
that encode an EGF-like motif. They identified several partial cDNAs
encoding novel proteins with EGF-like domains, such as EGFL4, which they
named MEGF8. The predicted partial EGFL4 protein has a laminin (e.g.,
150240)-type EGF-like domain, 5 EGF-like domains, and a transmembrane
domain.

MAPPING

Using a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nakayama et al. (1998) mapped
the EGFL4 gene to 19q12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 unrelated probands with a form of Carpenter syndrome frequently
associated with defective lateralization (CRPT2; 614976), Twigg et al.
(2012) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the
MEGF8 gene (see, e.g., 604267.0001-604267.0004).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis in mice, Zhang et al.
(2009) found a recessive phenotype characterized by heterotaxy, complex
congenital heart defects, and preaxial polydactyly that was associated
with a cys193-to-arg (C193R) substitution in the Megf8 gene on mouse
chromosome 7. The authors used massively parallel sequencing to identify
the mutation. The substitution eliminated an invariant cysteine situated
in the second putative EGF domain and could disrupt formation of a
disulfide bond required for proper protein folding. Megf8 transcripts
were ubiquitously expressed in both wildtype and mutant mouse embryos.
Immunostaining showed punctate nuclear localization with Gfi1b (604383)
and Baf60c (SMARCD3; 601737), 2 proteins involved in chromatin
remodeling. Mutant mice showed normal breaking of symmetry at the node,
but Nodal (601265) signaling failed to be propagated to the left lateral
plate mesoderm. Cilia motility was unaffected. Morpholino knockdown of
Megf8 in zebrafish embryos resulted in a heterotaxic phenotype with
discordant heart and gut situs. The findings suggested that MEGF8 is an
essential regulator of left-right patterning.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARPENTER SYNDROME 2
MEGF8, ARG1499HIS

In a 9-year-old Turkish boy with features of Carpenter syndrome and
dextrocardia (CRPT2; 614976), Twigg et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for a 4496G-A transition in exon 26 of the MEGF8 gene,
resulting in an arg1499-to-his (R1499H) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in a kelch domain. The mutation was present in
heterozygosity in his unaffected parents and sister, but was not found
in the dbSNP135 or Exome Variant Server databases. In zebrafish
morpholino knockdown experiments, coinjection of the R1499H mutant did
not result in effective rescue compared to wildtype, but the reduced
proportion of epiboly defects (down to 60% from 83%) suggested that the
mutant protein might retain some residual function.

.0002
CARPENTER SYNDROME 2
MEGF8, SER2367GLY

In a 6.5-year-old German girl with features of Carpenter syndrome
(CRPT2; 614976), Twigg et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity
for a missense and a nonsense mutation in the MEGF8 gene: a 7099A-G
transition in exon 41, resulting in a ser2367-to-gly (S2367G)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in an EGF-like laminin
domain, and a 1342C-T transition in exon 7, resulting in an
arg448-to-ter (R448X; 604267.0002) substitution. The patient's
unaffected father was heterozygous for the S367G mutation, which was not
found in 192 northern European controls, and her unaffected mother was
heterozygous for the R448X mutation, which was not found in 189 Turkish
controls; neither mutation was found in the dbSNP135 or Exome Variant
Server databases. In zebrafish morpholino knockdown experiments,
coinjection of the S236G mutant did not result in effective rescue
compared to wildtype, but the reduced proportion of epiboly defects
(down to 71% from 83%) suggested that the mutant protein might retain
some residual function.

In a Turkish boy with features of Carpenter syndrome who also exhibited
dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis (CRPT2; 604267), originally
reported by Altunhan et al. (2011), Twigg et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for a 595G-C transversion in exon 4 of the MEGF8 gene,
resulting in a gly199-to-arg (G199R) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in an EGF domain. The proband's unaffected father and 2
unaffected sisters were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in 189 Turkish controls or in the dbSNP135 or Exome Variant Server
databases; his mother was deceased. In zebrafish morpholino knockdown
experiments, coinjection of the G199R mutant did not result in effective
rescue compared to wildtype, but the reduced proportion of epiboly
defects (down to 73% from 83%) suggested that the mutant protein might
retain some residual function.

611856	TITLE *611856 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L52; MRPL52
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL52
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl52 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL52. They also identified MRPL52 homologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast, E. coli, or Arabidopsis.
Mouse and human MRPL52 share 85.1% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MRPL52
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP RH103319).

603189	TITLE *603189 SYNTAXIN 5; STX5
;;STX5A
DESCRIPTION In eukaryotic cells, vesicle docking is thought to be regulated in part
by the specific interactions of a vesicle-associated membrane protein
(VAMP), or synaptobrevin (e.g., 185880), with the presynaptic plasma
membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP25 (600322). By PCR using
oligonucleotides based on the sequence of rat syntaxin-5, Ravichandran
and Roche (1997) isolated a partial cDNA encoding human syntaxin-5. They
used the partial cDNA to clone a full-length human syntaxin-5 cDNA from
an EBV-transformed lymphocyte cell cDNA library. The predicted 301-amino
acid human protein is 96% identical to rat syntaxin-5. In vitro, human
syntaxin-5 bound efficiently to rat VAMP2 (see SYB2; 185881) but not to
human SNAP25.

To fuse transport vesicles with target membranes, proteins of the SNARE
complex must be located on both the vesicle and the target membrane. In
yeast, 4 integral membrane proteins, Sed5, Bos1, Sec22 (see 604029), and
Bet1 (605456) each are believed to contribute a single helix to form the
SNARE complex that is needed for transport from endoplasmic reticulum to
Golgi. This generates a 4-helix bundle, which ultimately mediates the
actual fusion event. Parlati et al. (2000) explored how the anchoring
arrangement of the 4 helices affects their ability to mediate fusion.
Parlati et al. (2000) reconstituted 2 populations of phospholipid
bilayer vesicles, with the individual SNARE proteins distributed in all
possible combinations between them. Of the 8 nonredundant permutations
of 4 subunits distributed over 2 vesicle populations, only 1 resulted in
membrane fusion. Fusion occurred only when the v-SNARE Bet1 is on 1
membrane and the syntaxin heavy chain Sed5 and its 2 light chains, Bos1
and Sec22, are on the other membrane, where they form a functional
t-SNARE. Thus, each SNARE protein is topologically restricted by design
to function either as a v-SNARE or as part of a t-SNARE complex.

Windpassinger et al. (2003) observed that Human Genome Project sequence
data indicated that the STX5A gene is located on 11q12-q14, the region
to which the locus for Silver spastic paraplegia syndrome (270685) had
been mapped. They excluded STX5A as the mutant gene, as no mutations
were found on sequence analysis of at least 2 affected individuals from
each of 4 different families and 1 healthy control.

;;DYNEIN, LIGHT CHAIN 2B; DNLC2B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for sequences homologous to rat robl/LC7-like
gene-1, Jiang et al. (2001) identified 2 members of the dynein family
that they designated DNLC2A (607167) and DNLC2B. Both DNLC2A and DNLC2B
encode deduced 96-amino acid proteins with molecular masses of 10.9 and
10.8 kD, respectively. The proteins share 77% sequence identity and show
high homology to robl/LC7 dynein proteins. Northern blot analysis
detected higher expression of DNLC2B than of DNLC2A in all normal
tissues tested except liver. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues of 68 Chinese patients showed
upregulation of DNLC2A in 45 cases and dowregulation of DNLC2B in 44
cases compared with adjacent tumor-free liver tissues. In 7 additional
cancer cell lines studied, DNLC2A was highly expressed in all, whereas
DNLC2B was highly expressed in only 1 HCC cell line.

By genomic sequence analysis, Pazour et al. (2006) mapped the DYNLRB2
gene to chromosome 16q23.3.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ron and Habener (1992) cloned mouse Ddit3, which they called Chop.
Antisera raised against Chop recognized a nuclear protein with a
molecular mass of 29 kD.

Park et al. (1992) isolated the DDIT3 gene, which they called GADD153,
from human cells. The DDIT3 gene shows a high level of conservation in
both the structural and regulatory regions to the previously described
hamster gene. The human and hamster proteins share 91% amino acid
identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Ron and Habener (1992) showed that CHOP serves as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of the transcription factors C/EBP (116897, 116898) and LAP
(189965). They found that bacterially expressed CHOP inhibited the
DNA-binding activity of C/EBP and LAP by forming heterodimers that could
not bind DNA.

Using differential expression and immunohistochemical analyses of benign
nevi and melanomas of different levels, Korabiowska et al. (1997)
observed p53 (TP53; 191170) negativity and high expression of GADD34
(PPP1R15A; 611048), GADD45 (GADD45A; 126335), and GADD153 in all nevi.
However, in melanomas, p53 expression increased and GADD expression
decreased with the Clark level of melanoma thickness. Patient survival
time correlated negatively with p53 positivity and positively with
GADD45 and GADD153 expression. Korabiowska et al. (1997) concluded that
GADD proteins play an important role in the malignant transformation of
nevus to melanoma.

CHOP is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress imposed by
unfolded and malfolded proteins. By transcriptional profiling, Marciniak
et al. (2004) compared gene expression in unstressed and ER-stressed
wildtype and Chop -/- primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. They found that
Chop directly activated Gadd34, which promoted ER protein biosynthesis
by dephosphorylating Eif2-alpha (EIF2S1; 603907) in stressed cells,
causing accumulation of high molecular mass protein complexes in the
stressed ER. Chop also activated Ero1-alpha (ERO1L; 615435), which
encodes an ER oxidase. Consequently, the ER of stressed Chop -/- cells
was hypooxidized relative to the ER of stressed wildtype cells.
Pharmacologic and genetic manipulations promoting a hypooxidized ER
reduced abnormal high molecular mass protein complexes and protected
cells from the lethal consequences of ER stress. Marciniak et al. (2004)
concluded that Chop deletion protected cells from ER stress by
decreasing ER protein load and changing redox conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Park et al. (1992) determined that the human and hamster DDIT3 genes
both contain 4 exons, with the intron/exon junctions maintained at
identical positions.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization, Park et al.
(1992) mapped the DDIT3 gene to chromosome 12q13.1-q13.2.

CYTOGENETICS

CHOP is consistently rearranged in myxoid liposarcomas (613488) (Aman et
al., 1992). In the characteristic chromosomal translocation
t(12;16)(q13;p11), Crozat et al. (1993) showed that the CHOP gene is
fused with a gene on chromosome 16 provisionally designated TLS
(translocated in liposarcoma). The same gene was called FUS by Rabbitts
et al. (1993); see 137070. The TLS gene was found to be a novel nuclear
RNA-binding protein with extensive sequence similarity to EWS (133450),
the product of a gene commonly translocated in Ewing sarcoma (612219).
In TLS-CHOP, the RNA-binding domain of TLS is replaced by the
DNA-binding and leucine zipper dimerization domain of CHOP. Targeting of
a conserved effector domain of RNA-binding proteins to DNA may play a
role in tumor formation.

In an analysis of peripheral blood samples from 19 patients with myxoid
liposarcoma due to t(12;16) and in 1 patient with myxoid liposarcoma due
to t(12;22;20), resulting in the fusion of the CHOP and EWS genes,
Panagopoulos et al. (1996) found FUS/CHOP hybrid fragments in 3 patients
with t(12;16) and a EWS/CHOP hybrid in the patient with the latter
translocation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Endo et al. (2006) found that mice challenged intratracheally with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed Chop and Bip (HSPA5; 138120).
Compared with wildtype mice, mice lacking Chop showed reduced lung
inflammation in response to LPS, diminished Il1b (147720) activity, and
suppression of Casp11 (SFRS2IP; 603668) induction in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid. Inflammation of lung in response to Il1b was not
attenuated in Chop-deficient mice. Endo et al. (2006) concluded that
CHOP is critical in LPS-induced lung injury and in induction of CASP11,
which mediates activation of pro-CASP1 (147678) and pro-IL1B.

609367	TITLE *609367 KIAA1279 GENE; KIAA1279
;;KINESIN-BINDING PROTEIN; KBP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned KIAA1279. The deduced protein
contains 632 amino acids. RT-PCR detected high expression in heart,
brain, ovary, testis, spinal cord, and all specific brain regions
examined. Moderate expression was detected in all other adult tissues
examined, as well as in fetal liver and brain.

Brooks et al. (2005) reported that the KIAA1279 gene encodes a 621-amino
acid protein that shares 89% sequence homology with the mouse homolog.
The predicted protein contains 2 tetratricopeptide repeats. Northern
blot analysis of adult and fetal tissues detected expression of a 2.4-kb
transcript in all tissues except blood leukocytes. The transcript was
present in different parts of the adult central nervous system,
including cerebellum, cortex, medulla, spinal cord, occipital lobe,
frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and putamen.

By in situ hybridization of zebrafish embryos, Alves et al. (2010) found
that Kbp was ubiquitously and diffusely expressed in early development
and later became enriched in the central and enteric nervous systems.
Fluorescence-tagged Kbp was expressed in the cytoplasm of transfected
N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells, with enrichment at the Golgi
apparatus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Brooks et al. (2005) stated that the KIAA1279 gene contains 7 exons
spanning 28 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the KIAA1279
gene to chromosome 10.

Gross (2012) mapped the KIAA1279 gene to chromosome 10q22.1 based on an
alignment of the KIAA1279 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC012180) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of an embryonic mouse cDNA library, Alves et
al. (2010) found that Kbp interacted with the microtubule-destabilizing
protein Scg10 (STMN2; 600621), with tubulin alpha-7 (Tuba3b), and with
the kinesins Kif5b (602809), Kif5c (604593), Kif7 (611254), Kif2c
(604538), Kif3a (604683), and Kifc1 (603763). Sequencing revealed that
Kbp interacted with kinesin motor domains. Coimmunoprecipitation
analysis of transfected HEK293 cells and colocalization of Kbp and Scg10
in N1E-115 cells confirmed the interaction between Kbp and Scg10. Kbp
did not appear to interact directly with microtubules. Knockdown of Kbp
expression in rat PC12 cells inhibited NGF-beta (NGFB; 162030)-induced
neurite outgrowth. Alves et al. (2010) concluded that KBP has an
indirect role in regulating microtubule dynamics and neurite outgrowth
via its interaction with SCG10.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using homozygosity mapping in a large consanguineous Moroccan family
with Goldberg-Shprintzen megacolon syndrome (GOSHS; 609460), which is
characterized by microcephaly, mental retardation, facial dysmorphism,
and Hirschsprung disease, Brooks et al. (2005) mapped the disorder to
chromosome 10q21.3-q22.1. In affected members of this family, they
identified homozygosity for an arg90-to-ter mutation (609367.0001) in
the KIAA1279 gene. All patients in this family had bilateral generalized
polymicrogyria in addition to Hirschsprung disease, thus establishing
the importance of KIAA1279 in both enteric and central nervous system
development. In 4 affected members of a consanguineous British Pakistani
family, Brooks et al. (2005) identified homozygosity for a glu84-to-ter
mutation (609367.0002) in the KIAA1279 gene.

;;NEF-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 1; NAF1;;
A20-BINDING INHIBITOR OF NFKB 1; ABIN1;;
KIAA0113
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Nef protein, Fukushi et al.
(1999) isolated TNIP1, which they designated NAF1, from an activated
leukocyte cDNA library. They obtained full-length NAF1 cDNAs by 5-prime
and 3-prime RACE. Fukushi et al. (1999) identified 2 alternatively
spliced isoforms of NAF1, NAF1-alpha and NAF1-beta, that differ only in
their C-terminal amino acids. NAF1-alpha contains 636 amino acids, and
NAF1-beta contains 640 amino acids. Both isoforms have 4 coiled-coil
domains and a proline-rich C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected a
2.8-kb transcript in all tissues tested, with strong expression in
peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen, and skeletal muscle, and weak
expression in brain. NAF mRNA was also detected in various human
hematopoietic cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Fukushi et al. (1999) determined that the region of NAF1 that interacts
with the HIV-1 Nef protein is located within amino acids 94 to 412.
Overexpression of NAF1 increased cell surface expression of CD4 (186940)
in a reporter cell system, and cotransfection with Nef suppressed
NAF1-induced augmentation of CD4 expression.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, in vitro pull-down assays, and in vivo
immunoprecipitations, Zhang et al. (2002) determined that NAF1-alpha
interacts directly with ERK2 (176948). EGF (131530) treatment of
NAF1-alpha-transfected human osteosarcoma cells resulted in the
phosphorylation of NAF1-alpha by the EGF/MEK (176872)/ERK2 signal
transduction pathway. Overexpression of NAF1-alpha suppressed ERK2
nuclear translocation following activation and inhibited the
ERK2-dependent transactivation of ELK1 (311040) in a reporter assay.
Zhang et al. (2002) concluded that NAF1 is an attenuator of activated
ERK2 signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fukushi et al. (1999) determined that the NAF1 gene contains 18 exons.
Exon 1 is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fukushi et al. (1999) mapped the NAF1 gene
to chromosome 5q32-q33.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a murine model of allergen-induced asthma, El Bakkouri et al.
(2005) showed that delivery of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see
164011) inhibitory protein Abin1 to the lung epithelium resulted in a
significant reduction of allergen-induced eosinophil infiltration into
the lungs. This reduction was associated with an Abin1-induced decrease
in allergen-specific IgE serum levels and a reduction of eotaxin (CCL11;
601156), Il4 (147780), and Il1b (147720) in bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid. El Bakkouri et al. (2005) concluded that NFKB plays a critical
role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation and proposed that
inhibiting NFKB could be useful in asthma therapy.

Oshima et al. (2009) showed that mice deficient for Abin1 died during
embryogenesis with fetal liver apoptosis, anemia, and hypoplasia.
Abin1-deficient cells were hypersensitive to tumor necrosis factor (TNF;
191160)-induced programmed cell death, and Tnf deficiency rescued
Abin1-deficient embryos. ABIN1 inhibits caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763)
recruitment to FADD (602457) in TNF-induced signaling complexes,
preventing CASP8 cleavage and programmed cell death. Moreover, ABIN1
directly binds polyubiquitin chains, and this ubiquitin-sensing activity
is required for ABIN1's antiapoptotic activity. Oshima et al. (2009)
concluded that their studies provided insights into how ubiquitination
and ubiquitin-sensing proteins regulate cellular and organismal
survival.

HIF PROLYL 4-HYDROXYLASE 1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

HIF is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in mammalian
oxygen homeostasis. Posttranslational modification by prolyl
hydroxylation is a key regulatory event that targets HIF-alpha (HIF1;
603348) subunits for proteasomal destruction via the von Hippel-Lindau
(VHL; 608537) ubiquitylation complex. Epstein et al. (2001) defined a
conserved HIF-VHL-prolyl hydroxylase pathway in C. elegans and
identified Egl9 as a dioxygenase that regulates HIF by prolyl
hydroxylation. In mammalian cells, they showed that the HIF-prolyl
hydroxylases are represented by 3 proteins with a conserved
2-histidine-1-carboxylate iron coordination motif at the catalytic site.
The genes encoding these proteins were cloned and termed PHD1, PHD2
(606425), and PHD3 (606426) by the authors. Direct modulation of
recombinant enzyme activity by graded hypoxia, iron chelation, and
cobaltous ions mirrored the characteristics of HIF induction in vivo,
fulfilling requirements for these enzymes being oxygen sensors that
regulate HIF.

Bruick and McKnight (2001) independently identified the conserved family
of HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, which they called HPH1, 2, and 3,
respectively, that appear to be responsible for the posttranslational
modification of HIF that targets it for ubiquitination.

By quantitative RT-PCR, Oehme et al. (2002) found highest EGLN2
expression in testis, with much lower expression in the 16 other human
tissues examined.

Independently, Hirsila et al. (2003) cloned HIFP4H1, HIFP4H2, and
HIFP4HD3 by PCR of human colon, aorta, and lung cDNA. The deduced
407-amino acid HIFP4H1 protein contains a C-terminal catalytic domain
with motifs for binding iron and the C5 carboxyl group of
2-oxoglutarate. PCR analysis of adult and fetal samples revealed HIFP4H1
expression in all tissues examined, with highest expression in adult
brain, placenta, lung, and kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

In cultured mammalian cells, Bruick and McKnight (2001) found that the
inappropriate accumulation of HIF caused by forced expression of the
HIF1-alpha subunit under normoxic conditions was attenuated by
coexpression of HPH. Suppression of HPH in cultured Drosophila
melanogaster cells by RNA interference resulted in elevated expression
of the hypoxia-inducible gene LDH (see 150000) under normoxic
conditions. Bruick and McKnight (2001) concluded that HPH is an
essential component of the pathway through which cells sense oxygen.

Using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells, Hirsila et al.
(2003) found that HIFP4H1, HIFP4H2, and HIFP4H3 showed in vitro
2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylation of a 19-residue peptide
corresponding to the C-terminal prolyl hydroxylation site of HIF1-alpha.
All 3 enzymes showed lower or no activity against a peptide
corresponding to a more N-terminal putative prolyl hydroxylation site in
HIF1-alpha. All 3 enzymes hydroxylated peptides designed from putative
prolyl hydroxylation sites of human HIF2-alpha (EPAS1; 603349),
HIF3-alpha (HIF3A; 609976), and C. elegans HIF-alpha.

Nakayama et al. (2004) demonstrated that PHD1 and PHD3 abundance is
regulated via their targeting for proteasome-dependent degradation by
the E3 ubiquitin ligases SIAH1 (602212) and SIAH2 (602213) under hypoxia
conditions. Siah2-null mouse fibroblasts exhibited prolonged Phd3
half-life, resulting in lower levels of Hif1a expression during hypoxia.
Hypoxia-induced Hif1a expression was completely inhibited in
Siah1a/Siah2-null cells, yet could be rescued upon inhibition of Phd3 by
RNA interference. In 293T cells, SIAH2 targeting of PHD3 for degradation
increased upon exposure to even mild hypoxic conditions, which coincided
with increased SIAH2 transcription. Siah2-null mice subjected to hypoxia
displayed an impaired hyperpneic respiratory response and reduced levels
of hemoglobin. Nakayama et al. (2004) concluded that control of PHD1 and
PHD3 by SIAH1 and SIAH2 constitutes another level of complexity in the
regulation of HIF1A during hypoxia.

Minamishima and Kaelin (2010) showed that loss of all 3 PHDs (PHD1;
PHD2, 606425; and PHD3, 606426) in the liver dramatically increased EPO
(133170) and hematocrit values to concentrations vastly in excess of
those achieved after renal PHD2 inactivation. Minamishima and Kaelin
(2010) found that PHD2 inactivation is sufficient to induce near maximal
renal EPO production, whereas inactivation of all 3 PHDs is needed to
reactivate hepatic EPO production.

ANIMAL MODEL

HIF prolyl hydroxylases are oxygen sensors that regulate the stability
of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in an oxygen-dependent manner.
Aragones et al. (2008) showed that loss of Phd1 expression in knockout
mice lowers oxygen consumption in skeletal muscle by reprogramming
glucose metabolism from oxidative to more anaerobic ATP production
through activation of a PPAR-alpha (170998) pathway. This metabolic
adaptation to oxygen conservation impairs oxidative muscle performance
in healthy conditions, but it provides acute protection of myofibers
against lethal ischemia. Hypoxia tolerance is due to reduced generation
of oxidative stress, which allows Phd1-deficient myofibers to preserve
mitochondrial respiration. Of medical importance, conditional knockdown
of Phd1 also rapidly induces hypoxia tolerance. These findings delineate
a new role of Phd1 in hypoxia tolerance and offer new treatment
perspectives for disorders characterized by oxidative stress.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the EGLN2 gene to chromosome 19q13.2 based on an
alignment of the EGLN2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ310544) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607865	TITLE *607865 SET DOMAIN PROTEIN, BIFURCATED, 2; SETDB2
;;CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA DELETION REGION GENE 8; CLLD8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins that contain a SET domain, such as SETDB2, modulate gene
expression epigenetically through histone H3 (see 602810) methylation.
SETDB2 is likely a histone H3 methyltransferase, as it contains both the
active site and flanking cysteine residues required for catalytic
activity (Zhang et al., 2003).

CLONING

Mabuchi et al. (2001) assembled a high-resolution physical map spanning
the critical region deleted in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(109543) on chromosome 13q14 and identified SETDB2, which they
designated CLLD8. The deduced 719-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 82 kD. SETDB2 contains a methyl-CpG-binding
domain, a preSET domain, and a SET domain that is bifurcated by a
218-amino acid insertion. SETDB2 shares 45% identity with SETDB1
(604396). Northern blot analysis detected a 3.3-kb transcript in nearly
all tissues and tumor cell lines examined, with highest expression in
heart, testis, and ovary.

Using a positional cloning approach, Zhang et al. (2003) cloned SETDB2
from a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 13q14 that influences
immunoglobulin E levels and asthma (147050). Northern blot analysis
detected a 4.0-kb transcript in all tissues examined. Higher molecular
mass bands were also detected at lower levels.

- SETDB2/PHF11 Fusion Transcripts

Using primers designed from exons utilized by SETDB2 and PHF11 (607796),
Zhang et al. (2003) amplified PCR products that spanned both and
represented 3 alternatively spliced fusion transcripts. Expression of
each transcript was tissue specific and was detected in nearly all
tissues examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mabuchi et al. (2001) determined that the SETDB2 gene contains 15 exons
and spans 49 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Mabuchi et al. (2001) mapped the SETDB2
gene to chromosome 13q14. It is centromeric to and transcribed in the
same direction as the PHF11 gene.

603801	TITLE *603801 N-MYRISTOYLTRANSFERASE 2; NMT2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-myristoyltransferase (NMT; EC 2.3.1.97) catalyzes the transfer of
myristic acid from myristoyl coenzyme A to the amino group of a
protein's N-terminal glycine residue. See NMT1 (160993).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences related to NMT1, Giang and
Cravatt (1998) identified human cDNAs encoding NMT1 and a distinct
enzyme, NMT2. They also isolated and characterized the respective mouse
homologs, Nmt1 and Nmt2. The predicted 498-amino acid human NMT2 protein
shares 77% and 96% sequence identity with human NMT1 and mouse Nmt2,
respectively. On Western blots of extracts of mammalian cells expressing
NMT2, the enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 65 kD. Northern
blot analysis revealed that NMT1 and NMT2 are expressed in most human
and mouse tissues.

CYTOGENETICS

In a Caucasian male with hypogonadism and testicular atrophy (241100),
Quintero-Rivera et al. (2007) identified an apparently balanced
translocation t(8;10)(p11.2;p13), which was also found in his mother and
maternal grandmother. There were no known genes disrupted by the 8p11
breakpoint; however, FISH mapping with overlapping BAC clones of the
10p13 breakpoint demonstrated disruption of the NMT2 gene between exons
1 and 3. The authors suggested that dysfunctional N-myristolylation is a
possible mechanism for testicular failure, either directly or in concert
with viral insults.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calprotectin, the heterodimeric protein complex composed of S100A8 and
S100A9 (123886), is a major calcium- and zinc-binding protein in the
cytosol of neutrophils, monocytes, and keratinocytes (Sampson et al.,
2002). Vogl et al. (2007) noted that complexes of S100A8 and S100A9 are
the physiologically relevant forms of these proteins.

CLONING

Wilson et al. (1975) found a serum protein abnormality in both
heterozygotes and homozygotes with cystic fibrosis (CF; 219700).
Immunologic quantitation of the protein, called CF antigen, allowed the
3 genotypes to be distinguished (Manson and Brock, 1980; Bullock et al.,
1982).

Van Heyningen et al. (1985) showed that a protein immunologically
indistinguishable from CF antigen is present at high levels in
granulocytes from normal and CF persons as well as in myeloid leukemia
cells. They studied somatic cell hybrids between a mouse myeloid stem
cell line and human myeloid leukemia cells and found that CFAg was
expressed only when human chromosome 1 was present. The authors were
inclined to think that the accumulated protein was itself the product of
the CF gene and that it was altered so that it could not be processed
normally; thus, the site of the mutation might be a region of a
polypeptide chain that acts as a site for a specific proteolytic
cleavage step.

Dorin et al. (1987) isolated cDNA clones for CFA from a library
constructed with mRNA from chronic myeloid leukemia cells. The complete
nucleotide sequence was obtained from the cDNA clone and by primary
extension of mRNA. The amino acid sequence, as predicted from the
nucleotide sequence, showed significant homology with intestinal and
brain calcium-binding proteins. Dorin et al. (1987) concluded that
abnormal accumulation of such a protein in CF should be investigated,
since there is gathering evidence that the basic defect is in pathways
controlling chloride channel activity (Welsh and Liedtke, 1986; Frizzell
et al., 1986).

Wilkinson et al. (1988) produced monoclonal antibodies specifically
recognizing CFAG. Immunoaffinity purification of CFAG from several
sources showed 2 components: one of molecular weight 11,000 and one of
molecular weight 14,000. Wilkinson et al. (1988) isolated cDNA clones
corresponding to each protein. Since the major source of these proteins
is neutrophil granulocytes, Wilkinson et al. (1988) suggested the names
calgranulin A (CAGA) and B (CAGB; 123886). Both CAGA and CAGB show
homology with the calcium-binding protein S100 (S100A1; 176940).
Wilkinson et al. (1988) used the monoclonal antibodies to study tissue
distribution of the 2 proteins. Strong expression was found in
granulocytes and in a restricted subset of normal stratified squamous
epithelium, including tongue, esophagus, and buccal cells. Lung,
pancreas, and skin, sites where the cystic fibrosis defect is expressed,
were not calgranulin-positive. A number of hyperproliferative neoplastic
or frankly malignant epithelia were found to express the 2 proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Calprotectin is a protein complex consisting of S100A8 and S100A9.
Corbin et al. (2008) found that neutrophil-derived calprotectin
inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus in abscesses through chelation
of Mn(2+) and Zn(2+), an activity that resulted in reprogramming of the
bacterial transcriptome. Abscesses of mice lacking calprotectin had
enhanced levels of metals and increased staphylococcal proliferation.
Corbin et al. (2008) concluded that calprotectin is a critical factor in
the innate immune response to infection and that metal chelation is a
mechanism for inhibiting microbial growth inside abscessed tissue.

Vogl et al. (2007) demonstrated that mice lacking Mrp8-Mrp14 (123886)
complexes are protected from endotoxin-induced lethal shock and
Escherichia coli-induced abdominal sepsis. Both proteins are released
during activation of phagocytes, and Mrp8-Mrp14 complexes amplify the
endotoxin-triggered inflammatory responses of phagocytes. Mrp8 is the
active component that induces intracellular translocation of myeloid
differentiation primary response protein-88 (MYD88; 602170) and
activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1; 300283)
and nuclear factor-kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011), resulting in elevated
expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; 191160). Using
phagocytes expressing a nonfunctional Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4;
603030), HEK293 cells transfected with TLR4, CD14 (158120), and MD2
(LY96; 605243), and by surface plasmon resonance studies in vitro, Vogl
et al. (2007) demonstrated that MRP8 specifically interacts with the
TLR4-MD2 complex, thus representing an endogenous ligand of TLR4. Vogl
et al. (2007) concluded that MRP8-MRP14 complexes are novel inflammatory
components that amplify phagocyte activation during sepsis upstream of
TNF-alpha-dependent effects.

Using a mouse model of autoimmunity, Loser et al. (2010) showed that
production of the damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules
Mrp8 and Mrp14 was essential for induction of autoreactive Cd8 (see
186910)-positive T cells and development of systemic autoimmunity. FACS
analysis demonstrated that this effect of Mrp8 and Mrp14 was associated
with Tlr4 signaling and increased Il17 (603149) expression.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed upregulated MRP8 and MRP14
expression in human cutaneous lupus erythematosus (see 152700) lesions,
and MRP8 and MRP14 were detectable in sera from individuals with active
disease. IL17 was upregulated in CD8-positive T cells from individuals
with lupus when stimulated with MRP8 and MRP14, suggesting that MRP8 and
MRP14 have a key role in the development of autoreactive lymphocytes
during autoimmune disease. Loser et al. (2010) concluded that there is a
link between the local expression of DAMP molecules and systemic
autoimmunity.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrids containing rearranged human chromosomes,
Dorin et al. (1987) localized the CFA gene to 1q12-q22.

Using probes for both subunits of the CF-associated antigen, isolated
from a chronic myeloid leukemia-derived cDNA library, van Heyningen et
al. (1989) and Dorin et al. (1990) confirmed the assignment of CFAG
(CAGA) to 1q12-q21 and showed that CAGB cosegregates with it in a panel
of somatic cell hybrids.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Psoriasis (see 177900) is an inflammatory skin disorder characterized by
keratinocyte hyperproliferation and altered differentiation. Linkage
analyses have identified at least 7 distinct disease susceptibility
regions. PSORS4 (603935) maps to chromosome 1q21, within the epidermal
differentiation complex (EDC; see 152445), a cluster that contains 13
genes encoding S100 calcium-binding proteins. Semprini et al. (2002)
analyzed S100 gene expression in psoriatic individuals from 2 large
pedigrees characterized by linkage studies, 1 linked and 1 unlinked to
the 1q21 locus. The analyses demonstrated that only the 1q21-linked
family had upregulation of S100A8, S100A9, and, to a lesser extent,
S100A7 (600353) and S100A12 (603112). Later studies confirmed
S100A8/S100A9-specific overexpression in 1q-linked pedigrees.

Zenz et al. (2005) showed that inducible epidermal deletion of JunB
(165161) and its functional companion c-Jun (165160) in adult mice leads
within 2 weeks to a phenotype resembling the histologic and molecular
hallmarks of psoriasis, including arthritic lesions. In contrast to the
skin phenotype, the development of arthritic lesions required T and B
cells and signaling through tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1;
191190). Prior to the disease onset, the chemotactic proteins S100A8 and
S100A9, which map to the psoriasis susceptibility region PSORS4, were
strongly induced in mutant keratinocytes in vivo and in vitro. Zenz et
al. (2005) proposed that the abrogation of JunB/activator protein-1
(AP1) in keratinocytes triggers chemokine/cytokine expression, which
recruits neutrophils and macrophages to the epidermis, thereby
contributing to the phenotypic changes observed in psoriasis. Thus,
their data supported the hypothesis that epidermal alterations are
sufficient to initiate both skin lesions and arthritis in psoriasis.

Calprotectin, the complex of S100A8 and S100A9, is a major calcium- and
zinc-binding protein in the cytosol of neutrophils, monocytes, and
keratinocytes. Although serum concentrations of calprotectin are raised
in many inflammatory conditions, they are generally lower than 10 mg/L.
Sampson et al. (2002) reported greatly elevated serum concentrations in
5 patients with hyperzincemia and hypercalprotectinemia (194470), a
seemingly novel disorder of zinc metabolism. All 5 patients presented
with recurrent infections, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and evidence of
systemic inflammation. Cutaneous inflammation was present in 3, and 3
presented in infancy with severe growth failure. As no structural
defects in the S100A8 or S100A9 subunits of calprotectin were detected,
Sampson et al. (2002) suggested that the hypercalprotectinemia was
caused by a defect in its metabolism.

NOMENCLATURE

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC from 1q21 on which 9 different
genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be localized. The
clustered organization of S100 genes allowed introduction of a new
logical nomenclature based on their physical arrangement on the
chromosome with S100A1 being closest to the telomere and S100A9 being
closest to the centromere. In the new nomenclature, CAGA became S100A8.
Schafer et al. (1995) commented that S100A8 had been given 9 different
names by groups who had independently studied the same protein.

605880	TITLE *605880 LYSINE ACETYLTRANSFERASE 6B; KAT6B
;;HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE MYST4; MYST4;;
MONOCYTIC LEUKEMIA ZINC FINGER PROTEIN-RELATED FACTOR; MORF
MORF/CBF FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Champagne et al. (1999) identified and characterized monocytic leukemia
zinc finger protein-related factor (MORF), a novel human histone
acetyltransferase. MORF is a 1,781-residue protein that is ubiquitously
expressed in adult human tissues. MORF also contains a strong
transcriptional repression domain at its N terminus and a highly potent
activation domain at its C terminus, and may be involved in both
positive and negative regulation of transcription.

Using immunohistochemistry on mice of various developmental ages,
Campeau et al. (2012) demonstrated expression of Myst4 in the
telencephalic vesicles, trigeminal ganglion, spinal cord, dorsal root
ganglia, digestive tract, pancreas, liver, and ribs of developing
embryo; after birth, it is strongly expressed in the diaphysis of the
long bones, the kidney, and the patella, among other organs.

- MORF/CBP Fusion Gene

Panagopoulos et al. (2001) reported a novel t(10;16)(q22;p13)
chromosomal translocation in a childhood acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML-M5a) leading to a MORF-CBP (600140) chimera. RT-PCR experiments
yielded in-frame MORF-CBP and CBP-MORF fusion transcripts. Genomic
analyses revealed that the breaks were close to Alu elements in intron
16 of MORF and intron 2 of CBP and that duplications had occurred near
the breakpoints. The authors constructed an exon/intron map of the MORF
gene. The MORF-CBP protein retained the zinc fingers, 2 nuclear
localization signals, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, a
portion of the acidic domain of MORF, and the CBP protein downstream of
codon 29. The part of CBP encoding the RARA-binding domain, the
CREB-binding domain, the 3 cys/his-rich regions, the bromodomain, the
HAT domain and the glu-rich domains was present. In the reciprocal
CBP-MORF, part of the acidic domain, and the C-terminal ser- and
met-rich regions of MORF may be driven by the CBP promoter.

MAPPING

Champagne et al. (1999) mapped the MORF gene to chromosome 10q22 by
FISH.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) studied a cohort of 19 individuals with a
presumed diagnosis of the Ohdo syndrome SBBYS variant (SBBYSS; 603736).
Twelve individuals were considered to have typical features of the
syndrome, 2 had suggestive but milder features, and 5 were classified as
atypical. By whole-exome sequencing in 4 individuals with typical
features, Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) identified heterozygous mutations
in the KAT6B gene: a nonsense mutation (E1357X; 605880.0004) in
individual 4, a 1-bp insertion (605880.0001) in individual 1, and a 2-bp
deletion (605880.0002) in individual 2. Subsequently, all 19 individuals
with an SBBYSS or an SBBYSS-like phenotype were sequenced for the entire
KAT6B coding region by classic Sanger sequencing. Truncating mutations
in exon 18 of the KAT6B gene were confirmed in 12 individuals, and
individual 3 was found to have a heterozygous frameshift mutation in
exon 15 (605880.0003), which had not been detected on whole-exome
sequencing. When parental samples were available, the mutations were
shown to have occurred de novo. Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) suggested
that mutations of protein-protein interaction domains in exon 18 result
in a more complex phenotype than the phenotype due to simple
haploinsufficiency of KAT6B and raised the possibility that exon 18
mutations are activating or have a dominant-negative effect.

In 6 patients with genitopatellar syndrome (GTPTS; 606170), Campeau et
al. (2012) identified 5 different heterozygous de novo truncating
mutations in exon 18 of the KAT6B gene (605880.0005-605880.0009), all of
which were predicted to result in loss of the highly conserved
transcription activation domain. Campeau et al. (2012) noted that
SBBYSS, also caused by mutation in KAT6B, is a disorder with features
overlapping those of genitopatellar syndrome, but with clinical
differences.

Simpson et al. (2012) identified mutations in the KAT6B gene in 5
unrelated patients with genitopatellar syndrome (see, e.g., 605880.0006
and 605880.0010); they stated that the form of Ohdo syndrome (SBBYSS) in
which mutations in KAT6B had been found is phenotypically distinct from
genitopatellar syndrome.

In 2 children with clinical features of SBBYSS, including a 4-year-old
girl previously reported by Szakszon et al. (2011), Szakszon et al.
(2013) identified different de novo truncating mutations in the distal
region of exon 18 of the KAT6B gene (605880.0011-605880.0012).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Szakszon et al. (2013) noted that truncating mutations of KAT6B exon 18
between positions c.3018 and c.3892 had been shown to cause GTPTS,
whereas truncating mutations distal to position c.4069 in the same exon
cause SBBYSS (with one exception, a c.4360_4368delins mutation in a
patient with GTPTS; see 605880.0005). They stated that their finding of
truncating mutations of KAT6B exon 18 at positions c.5064_5071
(605880.0011) and c.5389 (605880.0012) in patients with SBBYSS confirmed
this genotype-phenotype correlation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Clayton-Smith et al. (2011) examined mice carrying a gene trap insertion
in the mouse ortholog Kat6b (Qkf/Myst4/Morf) that produces approximately
5% of the normal amount of Kat6b mRNA. The Qkf gt/gt hypomorphic mutant
displayed a number of defects that mirror SBBYSS syndrome, although the
phenotype in the mice is milder. Mice are of normal size at birth but
fail to thrive and have brain developmental defects as well as
craniofacial defects. Observed abnormalities include short and narrow
palpebral fissures, low set ears, and malocclusion. Qkf mRNA is strongly
expressed in the eyelids and teeth primordia during development. Similar
to individuals with SBBYSS, the Qkf gt/gt mice have long, slender feet
and disproportionately long first digits.

610005	TITLE *610005 TRAF2- AND NCK-INTERACTING KINASE; TNIK
;;KIAA0551
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Germinal center kinases (GCKs), such as TNIK, are characterized by an
N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal GCK domain that serves a
regulatory function (Fu et al., 1999).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned TNIK, which they designated
KIAA0551. The deduced 1,333-amino acid protein has an apparent molecular
mass of more than 100 kD and shares 40.9% amino acid identity with mouse
Nik (MAP3K14; 604655) over 981 amino acids. RT-PCR analysis detected
intermediate expression in brain, weak expression in kidney, testis, and
small intestine, and little to no expression in all other tissues
examined.

Using TRAF2 (601895) and NCK (600508) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen
of brain and T/B-cell cDNA libraries, followed by 5-prime RACE and PCR
of brain, heart, and spleen cDNA, Fu et al. (1999) cloned 8 TNIK splice
variants. The variants differ in their use of 3 exons encoding the
intermediate region between the kinase and GCK domains. The longest
deduced protein contains 1,360 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous TNIK expression, with highest levels in heart,
brain, and skeletal muscle. Expression of major 6.5-, 7.5-, and 9.5-kb
TNIK transcripts was tissue specific. PCR showed tissue-specific
expression of the 8 variants in brain, heart, and spleen. Western blot
analysis detected phosphorylated full-length TNIK at an apparent
molecular mass of 150 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Fu et al. (1999) found that TNIK was autophosphorylated in a manner
dependent upon lys54 in the ATP-binding pocket of its kinase domain.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that epitope-tagged TNIK
coprecipitated endogenous TRAF2 from human embryonic kidney cells.
Mutation analysis revealed that the intermediate domain was sufficient
for the interaction, although the GCK domain may contribute. The
intermediate domain was also sufficient for interaction with NCK.
Cotransfection of TNIK with JNK2 (MAPK9; 602896) enhanced JNK2 kinase
activity in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was mediated by the
GCK region of TNIK, but not the kinase domain. TNIK overexpression had
no effect on ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795), p38 (MAPK14; 600289), or NF-kappa-B
(see 164011). Overexpression of TNIK in several cell lines resulted in
cells that rounded up and lost attachment to the culture dish, whereas
overexpression of a TNIK mutant lacking the kinase domain had no effect.
Cell rounding was associated with enhanced distribution of actin in a
detergent-soluble fraction. Wildtype TNIK, but not TNIK lacking the
kinase domain, phosphorylated gelsolin (GSN; 137350) in vitro,
suggesting that TNIK may be involved in cytoskeleton regulation.

Taira et al. (2004) found that rat Tnik induced disruption of F-actin
structures, thereby inhibiting cell spreading. This effect was mediated
by interaction of the C-terminal domain of Tnik with Rap2 (RAP2A;
179540). Tnik interaction with Rap2 was dependent on an intact effector
region and the GTP-bound configuration of Rap2. When coexpressed in
cultured cells, Tnik colocalized with Rap2, and Rap2 potently enhanced
the inhibitory function of Tnik against cell spreading. Rap2 did not
significantly enhance Tnik-induced Jnk activation, but promoted
autophosphorylation and translocation of Tnik to the detergent-insoluble
cytoskeletal fraction. Taira et al. (2004) concluded that TNIK is a
specific effector of RAP2 to regulate actin cytoskeleton.

By affinity chromatography of rat brain synaptosome extracts, Kawabe et
al. (2010) identified Tnik among 15 proteins that interacted with
immobilized Nedd4 (602278), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Rap2a
coimmunoprecipitated with Nedd4 and Tnik, but only following protein
crosslinking. In vitro ubiquitination experiments revealed that Nedd4
monoubiquitinated Rap2a, but not Tnik or any other Ras (HRAS;
190020)-related small GTPase examined. Tnik was required for Nedd4
ubiquitination of Rap2a, and Rap2a monoubiquitination blocked Rap2a/Tnik
signaling. Nedd4 -/- mouse cortical neurons showed underdeveloped
dendrite extensions and arborizations, and expression of
dominant-negative Rap2a or Tnik mutants rescued dendrite morphology in
Nedd4 -/- embryos. Kawabe et al. (2010) concluded that NEDD4 positively
regulates dendrite extension by blocking RAP2A/TNIK signaling.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the TNIK gene
to chromosome 3.

167780	TITLE *167780 PANCREATIC POLYPEPTIDE/PANCREATIC ICOSAPEPTIDE; PPY
;;PNP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pancreatic polypeptide (PPY) was the first identified product of the
dominating endocrine cell type of the duodenal pancreas (Kimmel et al.,
1975; Larsson et al., 1976). This hormone of 36 amino acids seems to be
involved in the regulation of exocrine pancreatic secretion and biliary
tract motility (Schwartz, 1983). PPY may be important in regulation of
food intake; genetically obese laboratory animals have altered PPY
release and in New Zealand obese mice weight gain can be cured by
infusion of PPY. Children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS; 176270) have
blunted secretion of PPY (Zipf et al., 1981).

CLONING

PPY is synthesized as the N-terminal part of a relatively small
precursor. A second hormone, icosapeptide (with 20 amino acids, as its
designation indicates), is synthesized from the C-terminal region
(Schwartz and Tager, 1981). Boel et al. (1984) isolated a cDNA for the
gene for the precursor by oligodeoxynucleotide screening of a cDNA
library constructed from normal human pancreatic mRNA. They concluded
that a third peptide is made from the PPY precursor.

Takeuchi et al. (1986) isolated human cDNA clones for PPY and NPY from a
pancreatic endocrine tumor and a pheochromocytoma, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Plasma PPY is reduced in conditions associated with increased food
intake and elevated in anorexia nervosa. In addition, peripheral
administration of PPY has been shown to decrease food intake in rodents
(Asakawa et al., 1999). These findings suggest that PPY may act as a
circulating factor that regulates food intake. Batterham et al. (2003)
investigated the effect of intravenous infusion of PPY on appetite and
food intake in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover
study in 10 healthy volunteers. Infusion of PPY reduced appetite and
decreased the energy intake at a buffet lunch 2 hours postinfusion by
21.8 +/- 5.7% (P less than 0.01). More importantly, the inhibition of
food intake was sustained, such that energy intake, as assessed by food
diaries, was significantly reduced both the evening of the study and the
following morning. Overall, PPY infusion reduced cumulative 24-hour
energy intake by 25.3 +/- 5.8%. The authors concluded that their data
demonstrated that PPY causes a sustained decrease in both appetite and
food intake.

MAPPING

Pancreatic polypeptide and neuropeptide Y (NPY; 162640) show over 50%
homology of amino acid and nucleotide sequence. To investigate whether
pancreatic polypeptide and NPY may have originated from a common
ancestral gene, Takeuchi et al. (1986) used cDNA clones corresponding to
PPY and NPY to analyze genomic DNA from chromosome assignment panels of
human-mouse somatic cell hybrids. These studies showed nonsynteny, with
PPY on 17p11.1-qter and NPY on 7pter-q22.

In the course of creating a radiation hybrid map of the breast cancer
(BRCA1; 113705) region of 17q, Abel et al. (1993) found that the PPY
gene is located distal to TOP2A (126430), situated at 17q21-q22, and
proximal to GP3A (173470), situated at 17q21.32. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Flejter et al. (1993) placed PPY in the same position,
proximal to EPB3 (109270), previously mapped to 17q21-q22, and distal to
TOP2A. Chandrasekharappa et al. (1994) demonstrated that PPY and D17S78
are present within the same cosmid clone and, therefore, no farther than
45 kb apart on 17q21. Hort et al. (1995) showed that PPY and the PYY
gene (600781) are located approximately 10 kb apart on 17q21.1.

600187	TITLE *600187 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 5A; EIF5A
;;EIF5A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The eukaryotic initiation factor 5A is an 18-kD protein composed of 154
amino acids. It contains a unique amino acid residue, hypusine, that is
formed posttranslationally via the transfer and hydroxylation of the
butylamino-group from the polyamine spermidine to a lys50 within the
EIF5A protein. Koettnitz et al. (1994) isolated and characterized the
human EIF5A pseudogene. Subsequently, Koettnitz et al. (1995) identified
a genomic clone encoding a functional EIF5A. The authors showed that
this sequence could successfully complement yeast carrying the HYP2
mutation (the homolog of EIF5A), whereas the pseudogenes could not.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koettnitz et al. (1995) found that the human EIF5A gene contains at
least 4 exons and spans at least 4.8 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Saini et al. (2009) used molecular genetic and biochemical studies to
show that EIF5A promotes translation elongation. Depletion or
inactivation of EIF5A in the yeast S. cerevisiae resulted in the
accumulation of polysomes and an increase in ribosomal transit times.
Addition of recombinant EIF5A from yeast, but not a derivative lacking
hypusine, enhanced the rate of tripeptide synthesis in vitro. Moreover,
inactivation of EIF5A mimicked the effects of the EEF2 (130610)
inhibitor sordarin, indicating that EIF5A might function together with
EEF2 to promote ribosomal translocation. Because EIF5A is a structural
homolog of the bacterial protein EF-P, Saini et al. (2009) proposed that
EIF5A/EF-P is a universally conserved translation elongation factor.

To identify tumor suppressor genes in lymphoma (605027), Scuoppo et al.
(2012) screened a short hairpin RNA library targeting genes deleted in
human lymphomas and functionally confirmed those in a mouse lymphoma
model. Of the 9 tumor suppressors identified, 8 corresponded to genes
occurring in 3 physically linked 'clusters,' suggesting that the common
occurrence of large chromosomal deletions in human tumors reflects
selective pressure to attenuate multiple genes. Among the newly
identified tumor suppressors were adenosylmethionine decarboxylase-1
(AMD1; 180980) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A),
2 genes associated with hypusine, a unique amino acid produced as a
product of polyamine metabolism through a highly conserved pathway.
Through a secondary screen surveying the impact of all polyamine enzymes
on tumorigenesis, Scuoppo et al. (2012) established the
polyamine-hypusine axis as a new tumor suppressor network regulating
apoptosis. Unexpectedly, heterozygous deletions encompassing AMD1 and
eIF5A often occur together in human lymphomas, and cosuppression of both
genes promotes lymphomagenesis in mice. Thus, Scuoppo et al. (2012)
concluded that some tumor suppressor functions can be disabled through a
2-step process targeting different genes acting in the same pathway.

Translation elongation factor P (EF-P) is critical for virulence in
bacteria. EF-P is present in all bacteria and orthologous to archaeal
and eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (a/eIF5A). Ude et al. (2013)
demonstrated that EF-P is an elongation factor that enhances translation
of polyproline-containing proteins: in the absence of EF-P, ribosomes
stall at polyproline stretches, whereas the presence of EF-P alleviates
the translational stalling. Moreover, Ude et al. (2013) demonstrated the
physiologic relevance of EF-P to fine-tune the expression of the
polyproline-containing pH receptor CadC to levels necessary for an
appropriate stress response. Bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cells
have hundreds to thousands of polyproline-containing proteins of diverse
function, suggesting that EF-P and a/elF5A are critical for copy number
adjustment of multiple pathways across all kingdoms of life.

Doerfel et al. (2013) showed that EF-P prevents the ribosome from
stalling during synthesis of proteins containing consecutive prolines,
such as PPG, PPP, or longer proline strings, in natural and engineered
model proteins. EF-P promotes peptide-bond formation and stabilizes the
peptidyl-transfer RNA in the catalytic center of the ribosome. EF-P is
posttranslationally modified by a hydroxylated beta-lysine attached to a
lysine residue. The modification enhances the catalytic proficiency of
the factor mainly by increasing its affinity to the ribosome. Doerfel et
al. (2013) proposed that EF-P and its eukaryotic homolog, elF5A, are
essential for the synthesis of a subset of proteins containing proline
stretches in all cells.

MAPPING

Steinkasserer et al. (1995) mapped the EIF5A gene to 17p13-p12 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Three pseudogenes were mapped to
10q23.3, 17q25, and 19q13.2.

;;DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED IN NORMAL AND NEOPLASTIC CELLS; DENN;;
INSULINOMA-GLUCAGONOMA PROTEIN 20; IG20;;
RAB3 GDP/GTP EXCHANGE PROTEIN; RAB3GEP;;
KIAA0358
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chow and Lee (1996) reported the cDNA sequence of DENN, a novel human
gene that is differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells
(hence, the symbol DENN). Northern blot analysis revealed differential
levels of expression of a 6.5-kb DENN transcript in malignant cell lines
compared to normal human tissues, where expression was highest in fetal
brain and kidney and in adult testis, ovary, brain, and heart. In fetal
liver and in several human cancer cell lines, the authors identified
cDNAs representing alternative transcripts of DENN that harbor a
deletion of 129 bp encoding 43 amino acids. Present within the serine-
and leucine-rich DENN gene product is an arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid
(RGD) cellular adhesion motif and a leucine zipper-like motif.

Using the yeast interaction trap system to identify proteins that
interact with the death domain of the type-1 tumor necrosis factor
receptor (TNFR1; 191190), Schievella et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs
encoding 'MAP kinase-activating death domain' (MADD) protein.
Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated proteins from various human cell
lines detected an approximately 200-kD MADD protein. The deduced
1,588-amino acid MADD protein contains a C-terminal death domain.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned KIAA0358. The deduced protein
contains 1,581 amino acids and is nearly identical to DENN.

Chow et al. (1998) stated that the DENN and MADD cDNAs and proteins are
virtually identical. From genomic studies, they traced the alternative
splicing of a 129-bp fragment to an alternative 5-prime donor site
involving exon 7. The deduced longer DENN isoform has 1,587 amino acids.
Western blot analysis of human MOLT-4 T-lymphoblastic leukemic cell
proteins detected a doublet consisting of 138- and 142-kD polypeptides.
The authors found the DENN protein concentrated predominantly in the
cytosolic compartment of MOLT-4 cells but was restricted to the nuclear
compartment of PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells.

Efimova et al. (2004) identified 7 putative splice variants of MADD:
IG20 full-length (IG20FL), IG20, KIAA0358, MADD (also referred to as
DENN), IG20 short variant-2 (IG20SV2), DENNSV (also referred to as
IG20SV3), and IG20SV4. These variants arise from alternative splicing of
exons 13L, 16, 21, 26, and 34. IG20FL, the longest variant, is encoded
by all 36 exons of the MADD gene. RT-PCR detected variable expression of
IG20, MADD, IG20SV, and DENNSV in all human tissues examined. Expression
of KIAA0358, IG20FL, and IG20SV4 was not observed.

GENE FUNCTION

Schievella et al. (1997) found that the MADD protein associated with
TNFR1 through a death domain-death domain interaction. Overexpression of
MADD activated the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK2 (176948),
and expression of the MADD death domain stimulated both the ERK2 and
JNK1 (601158) MAP kinases and induced the phosphorylation of cytosolic
phospholipase A2 (600522). The authors suggested that MADD links TNFR1
with MAP kinase activation and arachidonic acid release.

Al-Zoubi et al. (2001) showed that HeLa cells permanently transfected
with IG20 or DENNSV were more susceptible or resistant to TNF-alpha
(TNFA; 191160)-induced apoptosis, respectively. All MADD variants tested
could interact with TNFR1 and activate ERK and NF-kappa-B (see 164011).
However, relative to control cells, only those expressing IG20 showed
enhanced TNF-alpha-induced activation of caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763) and
CASP3 (600636). Cowpox virus CrmA, an inhibitor of caspase-induced
apoptosis, inhibited apoptosis when transfected in IG20-expressing HeLa
cells.

Using specific small hairpin RNAs targeted to splice variants of the
MADD gene, Mulherkar et al. (2006) found that knockdown of the MADD
variant resulted in spontaneous apoptosis in HeLa cells and in a human
ovarian carcinoma cell line, and they demonstrated that the MADD variant
alone was necessary and sufficient for cancer cell survival. Mulherkar
et al. (2006) hypothesized that since the MADD variant can bind to death
receptors, it may prevent apoptotic signaling by interfering with death
receptor oligomerization.

Efimova et al. (2004) found that overexpression of DENNSV enhanced cell
replication and resistance to treatment with proapoptotic stimuli. In
contrast, IG20 expression suppressed cell replication and increased
susceptibility to proapoptotic stimuli. Moreover, cells that were
resistant or susceptible to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis exclusively
expressed endogenous DENNSV and IG20, respectively. Transfection of IG20
in a DENNSV-expressing cell line overrode endogenous DENNSV function and
increased susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli. Dominant-negative
I-kappa-B (see NFKBIA; 164008) reversed the effects of DENNSV, but not
IG20, indicating that DENNSV functions through NF-kappa-B activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chow et al. (1998) determined that the MADD gene spans at least 28 kb
and contains 15 exons, ranging in size from 73 to 1,230 bp.

Efimova et al. (2004) determined that the MADD gene contains 36 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the MADD gene
to chromosome 11. Using FISH, Chow et al. (1998) mapped the MADD gene to
chromosome 11p11.2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

ST3GAL3, ALA13ASP

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), previously reported by
Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

ST3GAL3, ASP370TYR

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), Hu et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 15
ST3GAL3, ALA320PRO

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous 958G-C transversion in exon 12 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an ala320-to-pro (A320P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the sialyl motif S. The mutation was identified by
linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.

179755	TITLE *179755 PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA TRANSLOCATION-ASSOCIATED GENE; PRCC
PRCC/TFE3 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PRCC gene is disrupted in a translocation t(X;1)(p11;q21),
frequently found in papillary renal cell carcinoma (Sidhar et al., 1996;
Weterman et al., 1996).

CLONING

Sidhar et al. (1996) demonstrated that the specific chromosomal
translocation t(X;1)(p11.2;q21.2) observed in human papillary renal cell
carcinoma (see RCCX1; 300854) results in the fusion of a gene at 1q21.2,
designated PRCC, to the TFE3 gene (314310) at Xp11.2. To determine
whether the TFE3 transcripts in a tumor cell line were altered at their
5-prime end, 5-prime RACE products were generated from the tumor cell
line. Sequence analysis revealed that these 5-prime RACE products
contained unique sequences. A probe generated from this unique sequence
was used to isolate clones from human fetal and monocyte cDNA libraries.
These clones hybridized to chromosome 1q21.2. Sidhar et al. (1996)
reported that the gene corresponding to the cDNAs encodes a 491-amino
acid polypeptide. The predicted PRCC protein has an N-terminal domain
rich in proline, leucine, and glycine but failed to exhibit homology to
other known proteins.

Independently, Weterman et al. (1996) identified the 2 genes involved in
the t(X;1)(p11;q21) translocation in human papillary renal cell
carcinomas. Weterman et al. (1996) cloned the PRCC gene from a human
cDNA library. They found that PRCC is ubiquitously expressed in normal
adult and fetal tissues.

Weterman et al. (2001) cloned a full-length mouse Prcc cDNA and
determined that the PRCC gene is well conserved throughout evolution.
Like the human gene, mouse Prcc is ubiquitously expressed in fetal and
adult tissues.

- PRCC/TFE3 Fusion Gene

A specific reciprocal translocation between chromosomes X and 1,
t(X;1)(p11.2;q21.2), was described in a case of trabecular papillary
renal adenocarcinoma by de Jong et al. (1986). The same rearrangement
was subsequently found in 4 additional cases of papillary renal tumors
and this translocation may be a characteristic of a specific subset of
papillary RCC (Meloni et al., 1993).

Sidhar et al. (1996) demonstrated the presence of a PRCC-TFE3 hybrid
transcript in 3 papillary renal tumors (see RCCX1; 300854) by RT-PCR
using 5-prime PRCC and 3-prime TFE3 primers. In 2 of the tumors the
breakpoint could be assigned to TFE3 intron 1. Sidhar et al. (1996)
concluded that the PRCC-TFE3 fusion protein apparently represents an
N-terminal transcriptional activation domain adjacent to a TFE3
DNA-binding domain. They noted that a frequent theme for translocations
in sarcomas is the fusion of a transcription factor activation domain to
a transcription factor DNA binding element.

Weterman et al. (1996) demonstrated that through the fusion of the TFE3
gene and PRCC on chromosome 1, reciprocal translocation products are
formed that are expressed in papillary renal cell carcinomas.

MAPPING

The PRCC gene was identified at chromosome 1q21 by translocation
breakpoint mapping (Sidhar et al., 1996, Weterman et al., 1996).

By FISH, Weterman et al. (2001) mapped the Prcc gene to mouse chromosome
3.

610113	TITLE *610113 ADAMTS-LIKE 4; ADAMTSL4
;;THROMBOSPONDIN REPEAT-CONTAINING 1; TSRC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADAMTSL4 belongs to a family of proteins that share significant
similarity with the ADAMTS family of metalloprotease (see ADAMTS1;
605174). However, ADAMTS-like proteins lack the zinc-binding
metalloprotease domain of ADAMTS proteins and are therefore secreted
glycoproteins rather than enzymes (summary by Gabriel et al., 2012).

CLONING

By database analysis and PCR analysis of mouse brain, Buchner and
Meisler (2003) cloned Adamtsl4, which they called Tsrc1. By database
searching with the mouse Adamtsl4 sequence, they identified human
ADAMTSL4. The deduced human and mouse proteins contain 1,074 and 1,036
amino acids, respectively, and share 76% sequence identity. The proteins
contain 7 predicted thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) repeats, 6 of which are
clustered at the C-terminal end. The thrombospondin domains are most
closely related to the ADAMTS (a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase
with thrombospondin type 1 repeats) subfamily. Northern blot analysis
detected a 4.4-kb mouse Adamtsl4 transcript in muscle, brain, and other
tissues; RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression in all fetal and adult
tissues examined.

Ahram et al. (2009) amplified first-strand cDNA from adult human tissue
and found expression of ADAMTSL4 in colon, heart, leukocyte, liver,
lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, testis, and placenta; expression was
weaker in bone marrow, brain tissue, kidney, and pancreas. Expression
studies in fetal tissue revealed strong expression in heart, kidney,
liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, but weaker expression in brain and
skin.

Using Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses, Gabriel et al.
(2012) found that ADAMTSL4 was widely expressed in normal human eye and
was associated with both cells and extracellular medium. Western blot
analysis of conditioned medium from transfected HEK293F cells showed
that ADAMTSL4 was secreted as a major N- and O-glycosylated species with
an apparent molecular mass of 150 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Fibroblasts secrete fibrillin-1 (FBN1; 134797) and deposit it into
microfibrils after a period of confluence. Gabriel et al. (2012) showed
that conditioned medium containing human ADAMTSL4 accelerated the
deposition of Fbn1 into microfibrils by fetal bovine nunchal ligament
fibroblasts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Buchner and Meisler (2003) determined that the ADAMTSL4 gene contains 17
coding exons and 2 untranslated exons and spans about 10 kb of genomic
DNA.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Buchner and Meisler (2003) mapped the human
ADAMTSL4 gene to chromosome 1q21. They mapped the mouse Adamtsl4 gene in
a region of syntenic homology on chromosome 3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large consanguineous Arab family of Jordanian origin with isolated
ectopia lentis mapping to chromosome 1p13.2-q21.1 (ECTOL2; 225100),
originally reported by Al-Salem (1990), Ahram et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for a nonsense mutation in the ADAMTSL4 gene (610113.0001)
that segregated with the phenotype and was not found in 380 ethnically
matched control chromosomes.

In 2 Turkish brothers with isolated ectopia lentis who were negative for
mutation in the FBN1 gene (134797), Greene et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for a splice site mutation in the ADAMTSL4 gene
(610113.0002).

In 10 affected individuals from 5 Norwegian families with ectopia lentis
et pupillae (225200), Christensen et al. (2010) identified homozygosity
for a 20-bp deletion in the ADAMTSL4 gene (610113.0003). There was
evidence for a founder effect in this population. In 1 family, 1 of the
3 affected individuals had bilateral downward dislocation of the lenses
but normally positioned pupils.

In 6 patients with FBN1-negative ectopia lentis, including 1 who had
ectopia lentis et pupillae, Aragon-Martin et al. (2010) identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ADAMTSL4 gene,
including the 20-bp deletion reported by Christensen et al. (2010) (see,
e.g., 610113.0003-610113.0005).

In 8 patients from 7 German families with isolated ectopia lentis,
Neuhann et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the 20-bp deletion in
the ADAMTSL4 gene. A 4-SNP haplotype was consistently associated with
the mutation, suggestive of a founder mutation.

Chandra et al. (2012) identified mutations in the ADAMTSL4 gene in 8
Caucasian British probands with isolated ectopia lentis, including 6 who
were homozygous for the 20-bp deletion and 1 who was compound
heterozygous for the 20-bp deletion and a 1-bp deletion (610113.0006).
Another Caucasian British proband, who had ectopia lentis et pupillae,
was found to be compound heterozygous for the 20-bp deletion and a 1-bp
insertion in ADAMTSL4 (610113.0007).

In affected members of a large consanguineous Arab family of Jordanian
origin with isolated ectopia lentis (ECTOL2; 225100), originally
reported by Al-Salem (1990), Ahram et al. (2009) identified homozygosity
for a 1785T-G transversion in exon 11 of the ADAMTSL4 gene, resulting in
a tyr595-to-ter (Y595X) substitution at an evolutionarily conserved
residue, predicted to generate a truncated protein of 594 residues
lacking 6 of the 7 TSP1 repeats. The mutation segregated with the
phenotype in the family and was not found in 380 ethnically matched
control chromosomes.

In 2 Turkish boys with isolated ectopia lentis (ECTOL2; 225100), born of
consanguineous parents, Greene et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for
a -1G-A transition in intron 4 of the ADAMTSL4 gene that abolishes the
splice acceptor site and creates a premature stop codon. Their
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in the SNP database and was not described as a physiologic splice
variant in the ENSEMBL, UCSC, or Browser fast.db databases.

ADAMTSL4, 20-BP DEL, NT767

In 10 affected individuals from 5 Norwegian families with ectopia lentis
et pupillae (225200), Christensen et al. (2010) identified homozygosity
for a 20-bp deletion (767_786del20) in the ADAMTSL4 gene, causing a
frameshift predicted to result in a stop codon and premature truncation
113 bp downstream. RT-PCR analysis of ADAMTSL4 mRNA confirmed the
presence of a transcript truncated by 20 bp. Obligate heterozygotes had
no ocular abnormalities. Homozygosity mapping in the 5 Norwegian
families from Hordaland County in western Norway was compatible with a
common ancestor 150 generations (4,000 years) earlier, and the mutation
was found in heterozygosity in 3 of 190 local blood donors,
corresponding to a prevalence for homozygosity of approximately 1:16,000
in this population. In 1 family, 1 of the 3 affected individuals had
bilateral downward dislocation of the lenses but normally positioned
pupils.

In a 15-year-old boy with isolated ectopia lentis (ECTOL2; 252100),
Aragon-Martin et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for the 20-bp
deletion in exon 6 of the ADAMTSL4 gene. The 20-bp deletion was also
identified in compound heterozygosity with an 11-bp deletion
(826_836del11; 610113.0004) in ADAMTSL4 in 2 affected members of a
Caucasian British family with ectopia lentis and in an 8-year-old
Swedish boy with ectopia lentis et pupillae.

In 8 patients from 7 German families with isolated ectopia lentis,
Neuhann et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the 20-bp deletion in
the ADAMTSL4 gene, which they designated 759_778del20. The mutation was
found in heterozygosity in unaffected parents and sibs, as well as in 2
of 360 controls. A 4-SNP haplotype was consistently associated with the
mutation, suggestive of a founder mutation.

In 6 Caucasian British patients with isolated ectopia lentis, Chandra et
al. (2012) identified homozygosity for the ADAMTSL4 20-bp deletion. Two
more Caucasian British patients, 1 with isolated ectopia lentis and 1
with ectopia lentis et pupillae, were found to be compound heterozygous
for the 20-bp deletion and 2 different frameshift mutations: a 1-bp
deletion (237delC; 610113.0006) and a 1-bp duplication (2270dupG;
610113.0007), respectively, in the ADAMTSL4 gene.

607781	TITLE *607781 PROGESTIN AND ADIPOQ RECEPTOR FAMILY, MEMBER 5; PAQR5
;;MEMBRANE PROGESTIN RECEPTOR, GAMMA; MPRG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using homology with the sequence of seatrout membrane progestin
receptor, Zhu et al. (2003) identified ESTs containing MPRG, and they
cloned full-length human, mouse, and pufferfish MPRG cDNAs. The deduced
proteins contain about 330 amino acids, consisting of an extracellular N
terminus, an intracellular C terminus, and 7 transmembrane domains.
Northern blot analysis detected a 5.8-kb transcript expressed at high
levels only in kidney. RNA dot blot analysis detected highest expression
in adult and fetal kidney, colon, lung carcinoma, and HeLa cells, and
showed possible expression in adrenal gland and normal lung.

Tang et al. (2005) stated that the 7-transmembrane domain of the
full-length 330-amino acid PAQR5 protein shares significant similarity
with those of ADIPOR1 (607945) and ADIPOR2 (607946). The mouse ortholog
shares 91% amino acid identity with human PAQR5. RT-PCR detected highest
PAQR5 expression in human lung, colon, and small intestine. Weaker
expression was detected in pancreas, lymph node, kidney, brain, testis,
bladder, skin, and adult bone marrow, and little to none was detected in
adrenal gland, stomach, skeletal muscle, adipose, liver, prostate,
breast, heart, and thymus.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu et al. (2003) determined that recombinant MPRG, expressed by E.
coli, showed high-affinity progesterone binding. Steroid competition
studies showed specific binding to progesterone and several of its
hydroxylated derivatives, whereas estrogen, androgen, and corticosteroid
had low or no affinity for the receptor. Association and dissociation
kinetics were rapid.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tang et al. (2005) determined that the PAQR5 gene contains 7 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Zhu (2003) stated that the human MPRG gene maps to chromosome 15. By
genomic sequence analysis, Tang et al. (2005) mapped the PAQR5 gene to
chromosome 15q23.

606945	TITLE *606945 LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR; LDLR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The low density lipoprotein receptor is a cell surface receptor that
plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis.

CLONING

The low density lipoprotein receptor is synthesized as a 120-kD
glycoprotein precursor that undergoes change to a 160-kD mature
glycoprotein through the covalent addition of a 40-kD protein
(Tolleshaug et al., 1982).

Yamamoto et al. (1984) reported that the human LDL receptor is an
839-amino acid protein rich in cysteine, with multiple copies of the Alu
family of repetitive DNAs. Russell et al. (1984) demonstrated DNA
sequence homology of the LDL receptor with the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGF; 131530).

Sudhof et al. (1985) found that 13 of the 18 exons of the gene encode
protein sequences that are homologous to sequences in other proteins: 5
encode a sequence similar to one in C9 component of complement (120940);
3 encode a sequence similar to a repeat sequence in the precursor for
EGF and in 3 proteins of the blood clotting system--factor IX (300746),
factor X (613872), and protein C (612283), and 5 other exons encode
nonrepeated sequences that are shared only with the EGF precursor. Since
the LDL receptor is a mosaic protein built up of exons shared with
different proteins, it is a member of several supergene families.
Gilbert (1985) commented on the relevance of these findings to
understanding the significance of 'split genes' and 'exon shuffling'
during evolution.

MAPPING

Francke et al. (1984) assigned the LDL receptor to chromosome 19 on the
basis of expression studies in hamster-human somatic cell hybrids. The
LDLR gene was regionalized to 19p13.1-p13.3 by in situ hybridization
(Lindgren et al., 1985).

Frank et al. (1989) identified RFLPs of the mouse LDL receptor gene and
used them to map the gene, designated Ldlr, to the proximal region of
chromosome 9. Using interspecific backcrosses, they established the
order and interval distances for this and several other loci on mouse
chromosome 9, namely, Apoa4 (107690), which is on chromosome 11 in man,
and mannosephosphate isomerase (154550), which is on chromosome 15 in
man.

GENE FUNCTION

Brown and Goldstein (1974) described LDL binding to cultured fibroblasts
in a manner consistent with a receptor, and found that this binding
resulted in suppression of cholesterol synthesis by the cell via
repression of HMG CoA reductase. In a review article, Brown and
Goldstein (1979) described the mechanism of receptor-mediated
endocytosis using the LDL receptor as the prototypic example, thus
further describing its role in cholesterol metabolism. Normally, LDL is
bound at the cell membrane and taken into the cell ending up in
lysosomes where the protein is degraded and the cholesterol is made
available for repression of microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol
synthesis.

Lo et al. (2007) observed that inhibition of lymphotoxin (see 153440)
and LIGHT (TNFSF14; 604520) signaling with a soluble lymphotoxin B
receptor (LTBR; 600979) decoy protein attenuated the dyslipidemia in LDL
receptor-deficient mice, which lack the ability to control lipid levels
in the blood. The authors concluded that the immune system directly
influences lipid metabolism and that lymphotoxin modulating agents may
represent a novel therapeutic route for the treatment of dyslipidemia.

- LDL Receptor as a Viral Receptor

Hepatitis C virus (HCV), the principal viral cause of chronic hepatitis,
is not readily replicated in cell culture systems, making it difficult
to ascertain information on cell receptors for the virus. However,
several observations from studies on the role of HCV in mixed
cryoglobulinemia provided some insight into HCV entry into cells.
Evidence indicated that HCV and other viruses enter cells through the
mediation of LDL receptors: by the demonstration that endocytosis of
these viruses correlates with LDL receptor activity, by complete
inhibition of detectable endocytosis by anti-LDL receptor antibody, by
inhibition with anti-apolipoprotein E and anti-apolipoprotein B
antibodies, by chemical methods abrogating lipoprotein/LDL receptor
interactions, and by inhibition with the endocytosis inhibitor
phenylarsine oxide. Agnello et al. (1999) provided confirmatory evidence
by the lack of detectable LDL receptor on cells known to be resistant to
infection by one of these viruses, bovine viral diarrheal virus (BVDV).
Endocytosis via the LDL receptor was shown to be mediated by complexing
of the virus to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) or LDL, but not high
density lipoprotein (HDL). Studies using LDL receptor-deficient cells or
a cytolytic BVDV system indicated that the LDL receptor may be the main
but not exclusive means of cell entry of these viruses.

Atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (108725) shows close linkage to the
LDLR locus; indeed, the mutation(s) responsible for this phenotype may
reside in the LDLR gene rather than in a separate, closely situated
gene.

Zelcer et al. (2009) demonstrated that the sterol-responsive nuclear
liver X receptor (LXR) (see 600380) helps maintain cholesterol
homeostasis, not only through promotion of cholesterol efflux but also
through suppression of LDL uptake. LXR inhibits the LDLR pathway through
the transcriptional induction of IDOL (MYLIP; 610082), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that triggers ubiquitination of the LDLR on its cytoplasmic
domain, thereby targeting it for degradation. LXR ligand reduced,
whereas LXR knockout increased, LDLR protein levels in vivo in a
tissue-selective manner. IDOL knockdown in hepatocytes increased LDLR
protein levels and promoted LDL uptake. Conversely, Zelcer et al. (2009)
found that adenovirus-mediated expression of IDOL in mouse liver
promoted LDLR degradation and elevated plasma LDL levels. Zelcer et al.
(2009) concluded that the LXR-IDOL-LDLR axis defines a complementary
pathway to sterol response element-binding proteins for sterol
regulation of cholesterol uptake.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Rudenko et al. (2002) described the crystal structure of the LDL
receptor extracellular domain at endosomal pH. The ligand-binding domain
(modules R2 to R7) folds back as an arc over the epidermal growth factor
precursor homology domain (the modules A, B, beta propeller, and C). The
modules R4 and R5, which are critical for lipoprotein binding, associate
with the beta propeller via their calcium-binding loop. Rudenko et al.
(2002) proposed a mechanism for lipoprotein release in the endosome
whereby the beta propeller functions as an alternate substrate for the
ligand-binding domain, binding in a calcium-dependent way and promoting
lipoprotein release.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Davis et al. (1986) found that substitution of cysteine for tyrosine in
the cytoplasmic domain of LDL receptors impedes their internalization.
Lehrman et al. (1985) found that genes with nonsense and frameshift
mutations that truncated the cytoplasmic domain resulted in
internalization-defective LDL receptors.

In a patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH; 143890),
Hobbs et al. (1986) described an LDL receptor mutant in which 1 of the 7
repeating units constituting the ligand binding domain had been deleted.
The deletion arose by homologous recombination by repetitive Alu
sequences in intron 4 and intron 5 of the gene. The deletion removed
exon 5, which normally encodes the sixth repeat of the ligand binding
domain. In the resultant mRNA, exon 4 was found to be spliced to exon 6,
preserving the reading frame. The resulting shortened protein reaches
the cell surface and reacts with antireceptor antibodies but does not
bind LDL. It does, however, bind VLDL, a lipoprotein that contains
apoprotein E as well as apoprotein B-100. The findings in this
instructive case support the hypothesis that the 7 repeated sequences in
the receptor constitute the LDL binding domain, that the sixth repeat is
required for binding of LDL but not of VLDL, and that deletion of a
single repeat can alter the binding specificity of the LDL receptor.

Horsthemke et al. (1987) analyzed DNA from 70 patients in the UK with
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In most, the restriction
fragment pattern of the LDLR gene was indistinguishable from the normal;
however, 3 patients were found to have a deletion of about 1 kb in the
central portion of the gene. In 2 patients, the deletion included all or
part of exon 5 (606945.0027); in the third, the deletion included exon 7
(606945.0033). Including a previously described patient with a deletion
in the 3-prime part of the gene, these results indicated that 4 out of
70 patients, or 6%, have deletions.

Langlois et al. (1988) screened 234 unrelated heterozygotes for FH to
detect major rearrangements in the LDLR gene. Total genomic DNA was
analyzed by Southern blot hybridization to probes encompassing exons 1
to 18 of the LDLR gene. Six different mutations were detected and
characterized by use of exon-specific probes and detailed restriction
mapping. The frequency of deletions in the Langlois et al. (1988) study
was 2.5% (6 out of 234 patients). An illustration of previously mapped
deletions and the deletions identified in this study (a total of 16)
suggested that particular areas in the LDLR gene are susceptible to
deletion.

In a Japanese subject with homozygous hypercholesterolemia, Lehrman et
al. (1987) found a 7.8-kb deletion in LDLR (606945.0029). The deletion
joined intron 15 to the middle of exon 18, which encodes the 3-prime
untranslated region, thereby removing all 3-prime splice acceptor sites
distal to intron 15. The mRNA should produce a truncated receptor that
lacks the normal membrane-COOH terminus. The truncated protein was such
that more than 90% of the receptor was secreted from the cell, and the
receptors remaining on the surface showed defective internalization. The
deletion resulted from recombination between 2 repetitive sequences of
the Alu family, one in intron 15 and the other in exon 18. Lehrman et
al. (1987) stated that Alu sequences had been found at the deletion
joints of all 4 gross deletions that had been characterized in LDLR.
Because of these and similar findings in connection with deletions in
the gamma-delta-beta-globin cluster, recombination between Alu sequences
appears to be a frequent cause of deletions in the human genome (see
EVOLUTION).

Horsthemke et al. (1987) suggested that unequal crossing-over between 2
Alu-repetitive DNA sequences was responsible for an intragenic deletion
of the LDLR gene leading to familial hypercholesterolemia. A 4-kb
deletion had occurred between an Alu-repetitive sequence in intron 12
and a sequence in intron 14. The deletion eliminated exons 13 and 14 and
changed the reading frame of the resulting spliced mRNA such that a stop
codon was created in the following exon (606945.0032). The truncated
receptor protein appeared to be rapidly degraded. The deletion was
presumably caused by an unequal crossover event between 2 homologous
chromosomes at meiosis.

Hobbs et al. (1988) found that 16 of 132 cell strains (12%) from persons
with the clinical syndrome of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
synthesized no immunodetectable LDL receptor protein, indicating the
presence of 2 mutant genes that failed to produce crossreacting material
(CRM-negative mutants). DNA and mRNA from all but one of these
CRM-negative patients were available for study. Haplotype analysis based
on 10 RFLPs suggested that the 30 CRM-negative genes represented by
these 15 individuals had included 13 different mutant alleles. Four of
the alleles produced no mRNA; 3 of these 4 had large deletions ranging
from 6 to 20 kb that eliminated the promoter region of the gene. The
reason for the lack of mRNA in the fourth allele was not apparent. Three
alleles encoded mRNAs of abnormal size. One of the abnormal mRNAs was
produced by a gene harboring a deletion, and another was produced by a
gene with a complex rearrangement. The third abnormal-sized mRNA (3.1 kb
larger than normal) was produced by an allele that had no detectable
alteration as judged by Southern blotting. The other 6 mRNA-positive
alleles appeared normal by Southern blotting and produced normal-sized
mRNA but no receptor protein.

Among 20 mutant LDL receptor genes, Yamakawa et al. (1989) found 4
different deletion mutations (20%). None of these had been reported
previously in Caucasians. Three of them were novel and one was similar
to a previously described Japanese mutation. In 3 of the 4 deletions,
the rearrangements were related to intron 15 in which there are many Alu
sequences.

Rudiger et al. (1991) reviewed previously described deletions in the
LDLR gene in cases of familial hypercholesterolemia and reported the
finding of a deletion in 3 of 25 unrelated patients with FH. Two of
these were equivalent to previously described LDLR alterations, thus
supporting a notion of recombination hotspots which involve Alu
sequences. In at least 4 cases (FH626, PO, JA, and FH-DK3), a deletion
of exon 5 of the LDLR gene has been found as the defect responsible for
FH. The FH626 mutation was characterized by Hobbs et al. (1986) and
found to involve Alu repeat sequences in introns 4 and 5. Rudiger et al.
(1991) characterized FH-DK3 and likewise found involvement of 2 Alu
repeated sequences present in introns 4 and 5. The crossover breakpoints
involve sequences similar to those reported for FH626 but not at
identical positions in the 5-prime end. By use of denaturing gradient
gel electrophoresis (DGGE) in combination with PCR, Top et al. (1992)
found no evidence of a promoter mutation in the LDLR gene in 350
heterozygotes for FH. Hobbs et al. (1992) reviewed 71 mutations in the
LDL receptor gene that had been characterized at the molecular level and
added 79 additional mutations. Furthermore, they reviewed the insight
that all 150 mutations provided into the structure/function relationship
of the receptor protein and the clinical manifestations of FH.

Feussner et al. (1996) described a 20-year-old man with a combination of
heterozygous FH caused by splice mutation (606945.0054) and type III
hyperlipoproteinemia (107741).

Lee et al. (1998) studied 80 unrelated individuals with FH from the West
of Scotland. Microsatellite analysis using D19S394 was informative in 20
of 23 families studied. In these families, there was no inconsistency
with segregation of the FH phenotype with the LDLR locus. Using SSCP,
Lee et al. (1998) also detected mutations in exon 4 of the LDLR gene in
15 of 80 of these individuals; 7 of 15 had the same cys163-to-tyr
mutation (606945.0058). Lee et al. (1998) concluded that microsatellite
analysis using D19S394 is useful in tracking the LDLR gene in families
and could be used in conjunction with LDL cholesterol levels to diagnose
FH, especially in children and young adults, in whom phenotypic
diagnosis can be difficult.

Jensen et al. (1999) studied 17 families with mutations in the LDLR gene
as a model in which to test formally for linkage directly between an
atherogenic genotype and ischemic heart disease or aortocoronary
calcified atherosclerosis. The aortocoronary calcification was
significantly associated with age and plasma cholesterol. Sex,
hypertension, body mass index, and smoking were not associated with the
aortocoronary calcification. Nonparametric analysis indicated
significant linkage of the LDLR locus to aortic (p less than 0.00005)
and to aortocoronary calcified atherosclerosis (p less than 0.00001).
Assuming a dominant mode of inheritance, significant linkage was
detected for aortic (lod = 3.89) and aortocoronary calcified
atherosclerosis (lod = 4.10). Jensen et al. (1999) suggested that the
atherogenicity of variations in other genes could be assessed by a
similar approach.

Yamakawa et al. (1988) described a TaqI polymorphism in the LDLR gene
which should be useful in the study of FH. Leitersdorf et al. (1989)
used 10 different RFLPs to construct 123 differing haplotypes from 20
pedigrees. The 5 most common haplotypes accounted for 67.5% of the
sample. Heterozygosity and polymorphism information content (PIC) for
each site were determined.

Varret et al. (1997) described a database of LDLR genes and provided a
listing of the 210 mutations it contained as of the fall of 1996. Wilson
et al. (1998) described an online database of LDLR mutations.

Kathiresan et al. (2008) studied SNPs in 9 genes in 5,414 subjects from
the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study. All 9 SNPs
had been associated with elevated LDL or lowered HDL. One of the SNPs,
dbSNP rs1529729 in the SMARCA4 gene, was highly correlated with variants
in LDLR. Kathiresan et al. (2008) replicated the associations with the 9
SNPs and created a genotype score on the basis of the number of
unfavorable alleles. With increasing genotype scores, the level of LDL
cholesterol increased, whereas the level of HDL cholesterol decreased.
At 10-year follow-up, the genotype score was found to be an independent
risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction,
ischemic stroke, or death from coronary heart disease); the score did
not improve risk discrimination but modestly improved clinical risk
reclassification for individual subjects beyond standard clinical
factors.

Aulchenko et al. (2009) reported a genomewide association (GWA) study of
loci affecting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and
triglycerides sampled randomly from 16 population-based cohorts and
genotyped using mainly the Illumina HumanHap300-Duo platform. This study
included a total of 17,797 to 22,562 individuals aged 18 to 104 years
from geographic regions spanning from the Nordic countries to Southern
Europe. Aulchenko et al. (2009) established 22 loci associated with
serum lipid levels at a genomewide significance level (P less than 5 x
10(-8)), including 16 loci that were identified by previous GWA studies.
Association of the LDLR gene region identified by dbSNP rs2228671 was
found with total cholesterol levels (P = 9.3 x 10(-24)).

In a patient diagnosed with probable heterozygous FH, Bourbon et al.
(2007) analyzed the LDLR gene and identified a novel variant initially
assumed to be a silent polymorphism (R385R; 606945.0065); however,
analysis of mRNA from the patient's cells showed that the mutation
introduces a new 5-prime acceptor splice site that causes a 31-bp
deletion predicted to result in premature termination. The variant was
subsequently also found in a Chinese homozygous FH patient.

Defesche et al. (2008) analyzed the LDLR gene in 1,350 patients
clinically diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia who were
negative for functional DNA variation in the LDLR, APOB (107730), and
PCSK9 (607786) genes. The authors examined the effects of 128 seemingly
neutral exonic and intronic DNA variants and identified the R385R
variant in 2 Chinese families and a G186G (606945.0066) variant that
clearly affected a donor splice site and segregated with
hypercholesterolemia in 35 unrelated Dutch families.

In a metaanalysis of plasma lipid concentrations in greater than 100,000
individuals of European descent, Teslovich et al. (2010) identified SNP
dbSNP rs6511720 near the LDLR gene as having an effect on LDL
cholesterol concentrations with an effect size of -6.99 mg per deciliter
and a P value of 4 x 10(-117). This variant was also found to affect
coronary artery disease risk.

Kulseth et al. (2010) performed RNA analysis in 30 unrelated patients
with clinically defined hypercholesterolemia but without any LDLR
mutations detected by standard DNA analysis; sequencing of RT-PCR
products from an index patient revealed that the major product contained
an insertion of 81 bp from the 5-prime end of intron 14 of LDLR. DNA
sequencing of exons 13 and 14 detected an intronic mutation
(606945.0067) that segregated in heterozygosity with elevated
cholesterol in the proband's family. Kulseth et al. (2010) analyzed an
additional 550 index patients and identified the same splice site
mutation in 3 more probands.

Noting that large-scale genetic cascade screening for familial
hypercholesterolemia showed that 15% of LDLR or APOB mutation carriers
had LDLC levels below the 75th percentile, Huijgen et al. (2010)
proposed 3 criteria for determining pathogenicity of such mutations:
mean LDLC greater than the 75th percentile, higher mean LDLC level in
untreated than in treated carriers, and higher percentage of medication
users in carriers than in noncarriers at screening. Applying these
criteria to 46 mutations found in more than 50 untreated adults, 3 of
the mutations were determined to be nonpathogenic: 1 in LDLR and 2 in
APOB. Nonpathogenicity of the 3 variants was confirmed by segregation
analysis. Huijgen et al. (2010) emphasized that novel sequence changes
in LDLR and APOB should be interpreted with caution before being
incorporated into a cascade screening program.

- Modifiers

Vergopoulos et al. (1997) presented findings suggesting the existence of
a xanthomatosis susceptibility gene in a consanguineous Syrian kindred
containing 6 individuals with homozygous FH (see 602247). Half of the
homozygotes had giant xanthomas, while half did not, even though their
LDL cholesterol concentrations were elevated to similar degrees (more
than 14 mmol/l). Heterozygous FH individuals in this family were also
clearly distinguishable with respect to xanthoma size. By DNA analysis
they identified a hitherto undescribed mutation in the LDLR gene in this
family: a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 1999 in codon 646 of exon 14,
resulting in an arginine for cysteine substitution. Segregation analysis
suggested that a separate susceptibility gene may explain the formation
of giant xanthomas.

In a 13-year-old girl with severe hypercholesterolemia, Ekstrom et al.
(1999) demonstrated compound heterozygosity for a cys240-to-phe mutation
(606945.0059) and a tyr167-to-ter mutation (606945.0045) in the LDLR
gene. Her 2 heterozygous sibs also carried the C240F mutation, but only
one of them was hypercholesterolemic. The authors concluded that there
may be cholesterol-lowering mechanisms that are activated by mutations
in other genes (see 143890).

Knoblauch et al. (2000) studied an Arab family that carried the
tyr807-to-cys substitution (606945.0019). In this family, some
heterozygous persons had normal LDL levels, while some homozygous
individuals had LDL levels similar to those persons with heterozygous
FH. The authors presented evidence for the existence of a
cholesterol-lowering gene on 13q (604595).

Based on the finding from bioinformatic analysis that Alu repeats
represent 85% of LDLR intronic sequences outside exon-intron junctions,
Amsellem et al. (2002) designed a strategy to improve the exploration of
genomic regions in the vicinity of exons in 110 FH subjects from an
admixed population. In the first group of 42 patients found negative for
mutations by former screening strategies, approximately half (22) were
carriers of at least 1 heterozygous mutation. Among a second group of 68
patients recruited to correct for ascertainment bias toward exonic
mutations, 37 (27%) mutation carriers had a splicing regulatory
mutation. Of the 54 mutations identified, 13 were intronic and 18 were
novel, nearly half of which were intronic. Amsellem et al. (2002) stated
that their strategy of detecting the most likely disease-causing LDLR
mutations outside of Alu-rich genomic regions revealed that intronic
mutations may have a greater impact on the molecular basis of FH than
previously reported.

POPULATION GENETICS

Seftel et al. (1980) pointed to a high frequency of hypercholesterolemic
homozygotes in South Africa. In a 7-year period, 34 homozygotes were
seen in one clinic in Johannesburg. All were Afrikaners and most lived
in Transvaal Province. The authors calculated the frequency of
heterozygotes and homozygotes to be 1 in 100 and 1 in 30,000,
respectively. The oldest of their patients was a 46-year-old woman. Of
the 34, six were age 30 or older. The authors concluded that the high
frequency of the gene is attributable to founder effect, as in the case
of porphyria variegata (176200), lipoid proteinosis (247100), and
sclerosteosis (269500). Torrington and Botha (1981) found that 20 of 26
families with FHC (77%) belonged to the Gereformeerde Kerk, whereas
according to the 1970 census only 5% of the Afrikaans-speaking white
population of South Africa belonged to this religious group. Again, the
data were consistent with a founder effect. Using the LDLR activity of
lymphocytes, Steyn et al. (1989) calculated the prevalence of
heterozygous FHC in the permanent residents of a predominantly
Afrikaans-speaking community in South Africa to be 1 in 71--the highest
prevalence reported to date.

Hobbs et al. (1987) found a large deletion (more than 10 kb) in the LDLR
gene in 63% of French Canadians with heterozygous FH. The deletion also
occurred in homozygous form in 4 of 7 French-Canadian homozygotes. The
deletion removed the promoter and first exon of the gene and abolished
the production of mRNA for LDL receptor. The high frequency of the
mutation was interpreted as representing founder effect; 8,000 ancestors
account for present-day French Canadians and there has been relatively
little outbreeding. The deletion has not been observed in any other
ethnic group. It can be detected by analysis of genomic DNA from blood
leukocytes, thus allowing direct diagnosis of FH in most affected French
Canadians. Ma et al. (1989) identified a second 'French Canadian' LDLR
gene deletion which was found in 4 of 80 heterozygotes (5%). The
mutation consisted of a 5-kb deletion removing exons 2 and 3 of the LDLR
gene, which corresponded to the first 2 repeats of the LDLR-binding
domain (606945.0026).

Leitersdorf et al. (1990) analyzed the LDL receptor genes of 11 French
Canadian FH homozygotes. Only 3 different LDLR haplotypes were
identified, and the coding region of the allele associated with each was
sequenced. Three different missense mutations were found. Assays
developed to detect each of these directly were applied to 130 FH
heterozygotes from the greater Montreal area. The common deletion
(606945.0025) responsible for about 60% of cases (Hobbs et al., 1987)
and the smaller deletion (606945.0026) identified by Ma et al. (1989)
and found in about 5% of French Canadians were also sought. They were
able to detect LDL receptor mutations in 76% of the subjects and 14% had
1 of the 3 missense mutations. In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of
Quebec province, De Braekeleer (1991) estimated the prevalence of
familial hypercholesterolemia as 1/122, compared to the usually
estimated frequency of 1/500 for European populations.

Like the French Canadians, the South Afrikaners appear to have a unique
form of mutation in the LDLR gene consistent with founder effect (Brink
et al., 1987). Because of the presumed role of founder effect on the
high frequency of familial hypercholesterolemia in South Africa, it is
not surprising that Kotze et al. (1987) found a predominance of 2
haplotypes in 27 informative families with FH. In a study of homozygotes
from the Afrikaner population in South Africa, Leitersdorf et al. (1989)
found that 2 mutations account for more than 95% of the mutant LDL
receptor genes. Both mutations were basepair substitutions that resulted
in a single amino acid change and both could be detected readily with
PCR and restriction analysis. The findings were considered consistent
with the high frequency of FH being due to founder effect. Graadt van
Roggen et al. (1991) studied the prevalence and distribution of the 3
common mutations in South Africa in 27 unrelated homozygous and 79
unrelated heterozygous FH Afrikaner patients from 2 regions of South
Africa, the Transvaal and Cape Provinces. The 3 mutations were FH
Afrikaner-1 (606945.0006), FH Afrikaner-2 (606945.0009), and FH
Afrikaner-3 (606945.0044). The relative distribution of each of the 3
mutations was similar in the 2 regions, with frequencies of 66, 27, and
7%, respectively. Defects other than the 3 common mutations were more
frequent in the Cape than in the Transvaal; thus, the 3 known mutations
accounted for 98% of FH alleles in the Transvaal and only 74% in the
Cape Province. None of the patients carried the familial apolipoprotein
B-100 mutation.

Schuster et al. (1995) identified yet another homozygote for the
val408-to-met mutation (606945.0009), a 12-year-old Greek boy living in
Germany. The mutation was present in both his parents, his brother,
grandmother, uncle, and cousin. The haplotype, using 6 RFLPs of the LDL
receptor gene, was different from the one reported earlier in Afrikaner
and Dutch FH patients. Schuster et al. (1995) concluded that the
mutation in the Greek boy probably occurred independently. Furthermore,
they speculated that, because the parents were from different areas in
Greece, the mutation may be common in Greeks.

Deletion of gly197 (606945.0005) is the most prevalent LDL receptor
mutation causing familial hypercholesterolemia in Ashkenazi Jewish
individuals. Studying index cases from Israel, South Africa, Russia, the
Netherlands, and the United States, Durst et al. (2001) found that all
traced their ancestry to Lithuania. A highly conserved haplotype was
identified in chromosomes carrying this deletion, suggesting a common
founder. When 2 methods were used for analysis of linkage disequilibrium
between flanking polymorphic markers and the disease locus and for the
study of the decay of LD over time, the estimated age of the deletion
was found to be 20 +/- 7 generations, so that the most recent common
ancestor of the mutation-bearing chromosomes would date to the 14th
century. This corresponds with the founding of the Jewish community of
Lithuania (1338 A.D.), as well as with the great demographic expansion
of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals in eastern Europe, which followed this
settlement. Durst et al. (2001) could find no evidence supporting a
selective evolutionary metabolic advantage. Therefore, the founder
effect in a rapidly expanding population from a limited number of
families remains a simple, parsimonious hypothesis explaining the spread
of this mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals.

Defesche and Kastelein (1998) stated that more than 350 different
mutations had been found in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.
They tabulated the preferential geographic distribution that has been
demonstrated for some of the LDL receptor mutations. For example, in the
West of Scotland about half of the index cases of FH were found to have
the cys163-to-tyr mutation (606945.0058). Defesche and Kastelein (1998)
commented on the geographic associations of LDL receptor mutations
within the Netherlands.

EVOLUTION

Alu sequences are widely scattered in the genome, being present in
300,000 to 500,000 copies. They have been described, for example, in the
genes for alpha-globin (see 141800), gastrin (137250), gamma crystallin
(123660), insulin-like growth factor II (147470), and soluble thymidine
kinase. Each is about 300 bp long; thus Alu sequences represent about 3%
of the total DNA. On the basis of structural similarity, the origin of
Alu elements can be traced to the gene for 7SL RNA (Ullu and Tschudi,
1984). The abundant cytoplasmic 7SL RNA functions in protein secretion
as a component of the signal-recognition particle. This particle,
consisting of 6 different polypeptides and 1 molecule of 7SL RNA,
mediates the translocation of secretory proteins across the cytoplasmic
reticulum. Although the 7SL RNA has a well-defined biologic function,
that of the related Alu repeat remains unknown. Thus, the 7SL RNA gene
may be a progenitor of a processed pseudogene, the Alu element, that has
'recently' spread to different locations in the human genome. The
average Alu family member probably integrated into its present genomic
location about 15-30 Myr ago. The Alu family is specific to primates,
suggesting that these repeats were not present as little as 65 Myr ago.

According to the Alu family copy number, one would, on the average,
expect to find 1 such repeat every 3 to 5 kb in the human genome if they
are randomly distributed. However, studies of the
albumin/alpha-fetoprotein family by Ruffner et al. (1987) and of the
thymidine kinase (188300) and beta-tubulin (191130) genes by Slagel et
al. (1987) indicate clustering of Alu repeats in some parts of the
genome. For example, the beta-tubulin gene has 10 of these repeats in
less than 5 kb of a single intron and the thymidine kinase has 13
members within its introns in a region of about 10 kb.

HISTORY

Some early studies of somatic hybrid cells suggested that the gene(s)
for low density lipoprotein receptor may be on chromosome 5 or 21 or
both (Maartmann-Moe et al., 1982).

Li et al. (1988) worked out a PCR method for analyzing DNA sequences in
individual diploid cells and human sperm. They showed that 2 genetic
loci could be coamplified from a single sperm, and proposed its use for
genetic linkage studies. They analyzed the genotype of single sperm
derived from an individual heterozygous at the LDLR locus and the
HLA-DQ(alpha) locus and could show independent assortment. Individual
sperm were drawn into a fine plastic needle under microscopic
observation and delivered to a tube for lysis and amplification. Eighty
individual sperm were analyzed for the study of independent assortment
of LDLR and DQA. The method has great promise for fine mapping. Boehnke
et al. (1989) described the experimental design and issues of sample
size to be considered in the application of the method to the generation
of fine-structure human genetic maps.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Ldlr -/- mice expressing the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
(LCMV) glycoprotein (GP) transgene under control of the insulin
promoter, which functions as a mouse model in which type 1 diabetes
(125853) can be induced at will, Johansson et al. (2008) administered a
high-fat diet for 16 weeks to induce the development of advanced
atherosclerotic lesions before inducing diabetes. After the onset of
diabetes, there was increased intraplaque hemorrhage and plaque
disruption, regardless of lesion size, in mice fed low- or high-fat
diets for an additional 14 weeks. Furthermore, diabetes resulted in
increased accumulation of monocytic cells positive for S100A9 (123886),
a proinflammatory biomarker for cardiovascular events, and for a
macrophage marker protein, without increasing lesion macrophage content,
and S100A9 immunoreactivity correlated with intraplaque hemorrhage.
Hyperglycemia was not sufficient to induce plaque disruption: aggressive
lipid lowering, primarily of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, prevented
both plaque disruption and the increased S100A9 in diabetic
atherosclerotic lesions. Conversely, oleate promoted macrophage
differentiation into an S100A9-positive population in vitro, thereby
mimicking the effects of diabetes. Johansson et al. (2008) concluded
that diabetes increases plaque disruption independently of effects on
plaque initiation, through a mechanism that requires triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins and is associated with an increased accumulation of
S100A9-positive monocytic cells, and that this represents an important
link between diabetes, plaque disruption, and the innate immune system.

Lewis et al. (2009) generated mice lacking C1qa (120550) and/or serum
IgM (147020) as well as Ldlr and studied them on both low- and high-fat
semisynthetic diets. On both diets, serum IgM/Ldlr -/- mice developed
substantially larger and more complex en face and aortic root
atherosclerotic lesions, with accelerated cholesterol crystal formation
and increased smooth muscle content in aortic root lesions. TUNEL
analysis revealed increased apoptosis in both C1qa/Ldlr -/- and serum
IgM/Ldlr -/- mice. Overall lesions were larger in mice lacking IgM
rather than C1q, suggesting that IgM protective mechanisms are partially
independent of classic complement pathway activation and apoptotic cell
clearance. Lewis et al. (2009) concluded that IgM antibodies play a
central role in protection against atherosclerosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FH TURKEY
LDLR, GLN12TER

In a homozygote with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH; 143890) of
Turkish ancestry, Leitersdorf and Hobbs (1990) identified a CAG-to-TAG
change in codon 12 converting glutamine to a stop codon.

.0002
FH CAPE TOWN 1
LDLR, ASP26/GLY27DEL

In a South African black with FH (143890), Leitersdorf et al. (1988)
demonstrated deletion of aspartic acid-26 and glycine-27 due to deletion
of the 6 nucleotides of codons 26 and 27: GCGATG.

Thiart et al. (2000) found this mutation in 28% of mutant alleles in 56
South African black patients.

.0003
FH FRENCH CANADIAN 4
LDLR, TRP66GLY

This change in exon 3 is a class 3 binding-defective mutation
(Leitersdorf et al., 1990). In the French-Canadian population of a
province in Quebec, Moorjani et al. (1993) compared the clinical
features of homozygous FH (143890) because of the relatively high
frequency of a small number of mutations. In a comparison of 10 subjects
who had the trp66-to-gly (W66G) mutation in exon 3 with 11 subjects who
were homozygous for the 'greater than 10 kb' deletion of the promoter
region in exon 1 (606945.0025), they found the following: mean plasma
cholesterol concentration was higher in the subjects with the deletion
and there was no overlap in values in the 2 groups. Although the
frequency of coronary heart disease was similar in the 2 groups, age of
onset was earlier in subjects with the deletion; in addition, coronary
deaths were more frequent and occurred at an earlier age in the deletion
subjects.

Grossman et al. (1994) reported a 29-year-old woman with FH and a
homozygous W66G mutation who underwent hepatocyte-directed ex vivo gene
therapy with LDLR-expressing retroviruses. She tolerated the procedures
well, liver biopsy after 4 months showed engraftment of the transgene,
and there was no clinical or pathologic evidence for autoimmune
hepatitis. The patient showed an improvement in serum lipids up to 18
months after the treatment.

.0004
FH PUERTO RICO
LDLR, SER156LEU

Hobbs et al. (1989) found this missense mutation in a Puerto Rican
kindred that appeared to have an independently segregating mutation that
suppressed the hypercholesterolemia phenotype in some heterozygotes (see
144020). The same mutation was identified in a German family by Schuster
et al. (1993).

.0005
FH PISCATAWAY
FH LITHUANIA
LDLR, GLY197DEL

Meiner et al. (1991) found that the mutation was responsible for 35% of
71 Ashkenazi-Jewish FH (143890) families in Israel. Of the 25 Ashkenazi
patients who carried the mutant allele, 16 were of Lithuanian origin.
The mutation was not found in 47 non-Ashkenazi FH families. The mutation
was found in 8 of 10 FH cases in the Jewish community in South Africa,
which originated mainly from Lithuania. PCR amplification of a DNA
fragment that includes the mutation in heterozygous individuals results
in the formation of a heteroduplex that can be demonstrated by PAGE and
used for molecular diagnosis.

Mandelshtam et al. (1998) found this mutation in one-third (7 of 23) of
familial hypercholesterolemia cases in St. Petersburg (Russia) Jews and
in no patients of Russian descent.

.0006
FH AFRIKANER 1
FH MAINE
LDLR, ASP206GLU

Kotze et al. (1990) demonstrated a cytosine-to-guanine base substitution
at nucleotide 681 resulting in an amino acid change from aspartic acid
to glutamic acid at residue 206 (D206E) in the cysteine-rich
ligand-binding domain of the LDL receptor. The mutation gives rise to an
additional DdeI restriction site; segregation of the mutation with the
disease was confirmed in 5 large Afrikaner FH (143890) families. Kotze
et al. (1990) predicted that 65% of affected South African Afrikaners
carry this particular base substitution which can be diagnosed by PCR
amplification of genomic DNA followed by restriction enzyme analysis.
Indeed, from analysis of 138 chromosomes of Afrikaner FH (143890)
patients, Kotze et al. (1991) found this mutation in 91 (68.4%). Komuro
et al. (1987) described a homozygote for defective internalization of
the LDL receptor who survived to age 57. Leitersdorf and Hobbs (1990)
found the same mutation in an English-American living in Maine.

Vergotine et al. (2001) demonstrated the feasibility of prenatal
diagnosis of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in an Afrikaner
family with the D206E mutation.

.0007
FH MEXICO
FH FRENCH CANADIAN 3
LDLR, GLU207LYS

Codon 207 (GAG) is changed to AAG (Leitersdorf and Hobbs, 1990). The
same mutation was found in French Canadians with FH (143890)
(Leitersdorf et al., 1990).

.0008
FH DENVER 2
LDLR, ASP283ASN

In an African American patient with FH (143890), Leitersdorf and Hobbs
(1990) found a change of aspartic acid-283 (GAC) to asparagine (AAC).

.0009
FH AFRIKANER 2
LDLR, VAL408MET

This and the asp206-to-glu mutation (see 606945.0006) are frequent among
Afrikaners with FH (143890). A GTG-to-ATG mutation is responsible
(Leitersdorf et al., 1989). In a study of 138 chromosomes of Afrikaner
FH patients, Kotze et al. (1991) found that 31 (23.3%) had this
mutation. Schuster et al. (1993) found the same mutation in a German
family and showed that it existed on the same 7-RFLP haplotype as did
the mutation described in South Africa and in the Netherlands,
suggesting a common European origin. Similarly, Defesche et al. (1993)
found the val408-to-met mutation in 19 (1.5%) of 1,268 FH patients of
Dutch descent. In 9 of the patients carrying this mutation on one
allele, the LDLR DNA haplotype was that observed in a South African FH
patient homozygous for the same mutation. The remaining 10 Dutch FH
patients all shared a common haplotype, partly identical to the
Afrikaner haplotype, which could have arisen from a single
recombinational event. With the exception of the family reported by
Schuster et al. (1993), this mutation has been described only in persons
of Dutch ancestry.

A GCT-to-ACT change is responsible for this variant (Zuliani and Hobbs,
1990).

Esser and Russell (1988) found a GGC-to-GTC mutation as the basis of
this variant.

.0015
FH FRENCH CANADIAN 2
LDLR, CYS646TYR

Leitersdorf et al. (1990) found a TGT-to-TAT mutation in exon 14 as the
basis of this variant. See 606945.0003, 606945.0007, 606945.0025, and
606945.0026 for other French Canadian mutations.

.0016
FH LEBANESE
LDLR, CYS660TER

Lehrman et al. (1987) analyzed the nature of the LDLR mutation present
in high frequency in Lebanon; the frequency of homozygotes is more than
10 times higher than in other parts of the world. It was on the basis of
studies in Lebanon that Khachadurian (1964) first established the
existence of homozygous FHC (143890). Lehrman et al. (1987) demonstrated
that the mutation involves a shortened receptor protein containing 3
domains: the region of clustered O-linked carbohydrates, the
membrane-spanning region, and the cytoplasmic tail. The defect was
attributable to a single nucleotide substitution that creates a
premature termination codon at amino acid 660, eliminating 180 residues
from the mature protein. The termination codon occurred in the middle of
a cysteine-rich sequence that is part of the domain homologous to
epidermal growth factor precursor. The truncated protein retains only 2
domains: a complete ligand-binding region (residues 1-292) and a partial
epidermal growth factor precursor homology region (residues 293-659).
The mutant gene lacks the portions that code for the membrane-spanning
region and the cytoplasmic tail. After synthesis, most of the mutant
receptor remains within the cell. The mutation creates a new restriction
site for the enzyme HinfI, thus permitting diagnosis by Southern
blotting of genomic DNA. Lehrman et al. (1987) studied 4 unrelated Arab
patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, 3 from Lebanon
and 1 from Syria. They referred to this mutation as the Lebanese allele.
In 5 Christian-Arab kindreds in Israel, Oppenheim et al. (1991) found
the 'Lebanese' allele in correlation with hypercholesterolemia. In
addition, their results suggested the possible existence of an
independent factor contributing to elevated LDL cholesterol levels.

.0017
FH ZAMBIA
LDLR, PRO664LEU

In an Asiatic Indian with FH (143890), Knight et al. (1989) and Soutar
et al. (1989) found a CCG-to-CTG mutation changing proline-664 to
leucine. Knight et al. (1989) found that the precursor form of the
mutant receptor is converted more slowly than normal, and the mature
form on the cell surface binds LDL less well than normal. Soutar et al.
(1991) identified this mutation in a large Asian-Indian kindred
containing 22 heterozygotes and 3 homozygotes. All the heterozygotes had
a raised level of plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein
cholesterol, but were remarkably free from premature coronary disease.
No correlation could be found between the apo(a) phenotype (152200) and
the presence or absence of the LDLR mutation. There was, however,
evidence for an inherited trait that markedly increased Lp(a)
concentration, which did not segregate with either apo(a) or the
defective LDLR allele. FH Zambia was found in a patient with familial
hypercholesterolemia who was of Indian origin residing in Zambia.
Rubinsztein et al. (1992) found the same mutation in 4 South African
families of Muslim religion who traced their origin to the vicinity of
Surat in the Gujerat province of India. Functional studies suggested
that the FH in these subjects was due to low steady-state levels of
receptor molecules that are functionally normal but exhibit accelerated
turnover.

Among 915 consecutive patients with FH and of Dutch descent, Defesche et
al. (1992) found 7 persons with the C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2054
in exon 14. All the patients shared the same haplotype. Contrary to
previous reports, no difference was found in plasma levels of Lp(a)
between family members with the mutation in exon 14 and unaffected
persons.

.0018
FH BAHRAIN
LDLR, TRP792TER

In a Bahraini patient with FH (143890), Lehrman et al. (1985) found a
change in the tryptophan-792 codon to a stop codon as the basis of this
variant. Truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of the LDLR protein
results in defective internalization. Recurrence of this mutation was
observed by Loux et al. (1991) in the course of a survey of 139
unrelated French FH subjects.

.0019
FH BARI
FH SYRIA
LDLR, TYR807CYS

In an Italian patient with FH (143890), Davis et al. (1986) found a
TAT-to-TGT mutation in this internalization-defective allele.

.0020
FH NASHVILLE
LDLR, 4-BP INS, EX8

In an American patient with FH (143890), Leitersdorf and Hobbs (1990)
found insertion of 4 nucleotides in exon 8 causing frameshift and
premature termination as the basis of this null allele.

.0021
FH PARIS 3
LDLR, 4-BP INS, EX17

In a French patient with FH (143890), Lehrman et al. (1985) found
insertion of 4 nucleotides in exon 17 causing frameshift and premature
termination as the basis of this internalization-defective allele.
Benlian et al. (1990) found the same duplication of 4 bases in exon 17
as the basis of familial hypercholesterolemia in a homozygous offspring
of consanguineous French parents and in heterozygous relatives. The same
mutation was not found in any normal individuals or in 158 other
individuals with hypercholesterolemia type IIa. The duplication involved
the third nucleotide of codon 796 and the 3 nucleotides of codon 797,
resulting in a frameshift and a stop codon 20 basepairs downstream.

.0022
FH PORTUGAL
LDLR, ASP203ASN

In Portuguese patients with FH (143890), Hobbs et al. (1992) identified
a G-A transition in exon 4 of the LDLR gene, resulting in an
asp203-to-asn (D203N) substitution. The mutation was not found in over
200 non-FH alleles.

.0023
FH ST. LOUIS
LDLR, EX2-8DUP

In an American child homozygous for FH (143890), Lehrman et al. (1987)
found that the LDL receptor precursor was unusually long due to a
duplication of 7 exons. Unequal crossing-over between homologous
repetitive elements (Alu sequences) in intron 1 and intron 8 was the
basis of the duplication.

.0024
FH PARIS 2
LDLR, EX2-5DUP

In a French patient with FH (143890), Leitersdorf and Hobbs (1990) found
this mutation.

.0025
FH FRENCH CANADIAN 1
FH DENVER
LDLR, PROMOTER/EX1 DEL

Deletion of the promoter and exon 1 of the LDLR gene resulting in a null
allele is the mutation found in about 60% of French Canadian cases of FH
(143890) in Quebec (Hobbs et al., 1987; Leitersdorf et al., 1990).
Leitersdorf et al. (1990) quoted work indicating that all persons with
the 'French-Canadian deletion' trace their ancestry to a small town
northeast of Montreal called Kamouraska, thus illustrating founder
effect. Founder effect was suggested as well by the fact that the
mutation was also found in France where it was, however, rare (Fumeron
et al., 1992). The same mutation was found in a non-French Canadian
Caucasian in Denver, Colorado (Hobbs et al., 1988). Betard et al. (1992)
found that the 10-kb deletion had the same haplotype, called the B
haplotype. They identified 15 different haplotypes for the normal allele
in heterozygotes. Thus, founder effect is again supported.

(It is more accurate to state that Kamouraska is northeast of Quebec
City on the south side of the St. Lawrence River. See 609313 for a
unique form of erythrokeratodermia variabilis, designated the Kamouraska
type and symbolized EKV3, that has been identified in families living in
the same region of Quebec.)

Simard et al. (2004) identified the breakpoint of the more than 15-kb
deletion involving the promoter and exon 1 of the LDLR gene, as well as
the breakpoint of the 5-kb deletion of exons 2 and 3 (606945.0026),
which accounts for 5% of French-Canadian FH cases. Both deletions
appeared to be the result of homologous recombination by unequal
crossing over between the left arms of Alu repeats. Simard et al. (2004)
determined that 55% of the LDLR gene is composed of Alu elements; thus,
it is not surprising that most LDLR rearrangements involve at least 1
Alu. They developed a rapid PCR-based assay for these 2
'French-Canadian' deletions. Screening of a representative population
sample of 943 French-Canadian youths whose LDL cholesterol levels were
above the 50th percentile allowed Simard et al. (2004) to estimate the
prevalence of the more than 15-kb allele as 0.11% (95% confidence
interval, 0.03 to 0.38).

.0026

Ma et al. (1989) found deletion of exons 2 and 3 in a French Canadian
patient with FH (143890). The same mutation was found in 2 Japanese
patients with homozygous FH and called FH Tonami-2 (Kajinami et al.,
1989) and FH Tsukuba-1 (Yamakawa et al., 1989).

.0027
FH PARIS 1
LDLR, EX5DEL

In a French patient with FH (143890), Hobbs et al. (1986) found deletion
of exon 5 of the LDLR gene. Horsthemke et al. (1987) found the same
mutation in 2 English patients.

.0028

FH LEUVEN
LDLR, EX7-8DEL

In South African patients with FH (143890), Henderson et al. (1988)
detected a hitherto undescribed 2.5-kb deletion in the central region of
the LDLR gene, most likely including all of exons 7 and 8. The same
mutation was present in a Dutch patient in Leuven (Russell et al.,
1986).

.0029
FH ROCHESTER
FH OSAKA 1;;
FH HELSINKI
LDLR, EX16-18DEL

In an American patient with FH (143890), Lehrman et al. (1985) found
deletion of exons 16, 17, and part of 18, due apparently to Alu-Alu
recombination. The same mutation was found in Japanese by Lehrman et al.
(1987) and in many Finns by Aalto-Setala et al. (1989). A 9.5-kb
deletion extended from intron 15 to exon 18. Because of loss of the
domains encoded by exons 16, 17, and 18, the carboxy-terminal portion of
the normal receptor, comprising amino acids 750-839, has been replaced
by an unrelated stretch of 55 amino acids. This particular mutation was
found in 23 of 46 unrelated Finnish FH patients with an established
functional defect of LDLR. In cultured fibroblasts, both
receptor-mediated binding and internalization of LDL were reduced on the
average by 25 and 50%, respectively. Aalto-Setala et al. (1989) referred
to the mutation as FH-Helsinki. Rodningen et al. (1992) found the same
mutation in 3 out of 181 (1.7%) unrelated Norwegian FH subjects. All 3
showed the same haplotype. Aalto-Setala et al. (1992) found that the
FH-Helsinki mutation was present in 75 (38%) of 199 unrelated Finnish
patients with hypercholesterolemia. The prevalence ranged from 26 to 58%
in different areas of Finland, with the striking exception of the North
Karelia region where only 1 of 26 (4%) FH patients carried the
FH-Helsinki allele.

FH PAVIA
LDLR, EX2-12DEL

Bertolini et al. (1992) found a large rearrangement of the LDLR gene in
3 apparently unrelated families segregating for FH (143890) living in
northern Italy. Southern blot analysis demonstrated heterozygosity for a
25-kb deletion eliminating exons 2-12. The affected subjects possessed 2
LDL receptor mRNA species: one of normal size (5.3 kb) and one of
smaller size (3.5 kb). In the latter mRNA, the coding sequence of exon 1
was joined to the coding sequence of exon 13, causing a change in the
reading frame and thereby giving rise to a premature stop codon. The
predicted receptor protein, a short polypeptide of 29 amino acids, would
be expected to be devoid of any function. Bertolini et al. (1992) found
a common ancestor for the 3 families who had lived in the 17th century
in a region called Lomellina in southwest Lombardy, near Pavia.

.0047
FH NORTH KARELIA
LDLR, 7-BP DEL, EX6

Koivisto et al. (1992) identified a mutation found in many Finnish
patients with heterozygous FH (143890). The mutation, designated FH
North Karelia (FH-NK) , deleted 7 nucleotides from exon 6 of the LDLR
gene, caused a translational frameshift, and was predicted to result in
a truncated receptor protein. The mutation was found in 69 (34%) of 201
unrelated Finnish FH patients and was especially frequent (prevalence
79%) in patients from eastern Finland. FH Helsinki (606945.0029) and FH
North Karelia together account for about two-thirds of FH mutations in
Finland.

In Finnish North Karelia, with a population of about 180,000, Vuorio et
al. (1997) found that the FH-NK mutation accounts for 84% (340 of 407)
of FH cases, while the FH-Helsinki allele was found in 4% (18 cases).
The minimum prevalence of FH in North Karelia was estimated to be 1 in
441 inhabitants; in 1 commune, a frequency of 1 in 143 was found. By use
of parish and tax records, they identified a common ancestor for most of
the North Karelian FH-NK persons in the village of Puso, located within
an area where the FH prevalence is the highest. DNA analysis indicated
that 2% of subjects aged 1 to 25 years would have been diagnosed as
false-negative and 7% as false-positive FH patients on the basis of LDL
cholesterol determinations alone. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was
present in 65 (30%) of the 179 FH gene carriers aged 25 years or more,
and 19 individuals had a previous history of acute myocardial
infarction. The average age at onset of CHD was 42 years for males and
48 years for females.

In 5 patients of British extraction with familial hypercholesterolemia

and 695) of codon 206 (GAC).

.0050
FH OSAKA 3
LDLR, ASP412HIS

In a Japanese patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890), Miyake et al. (1992) identified a G-to-C transversion in exon
9 which was predicted to change asp412 to his. The amino acid change
occurred in the epidermal growth-factor-precursor homology domain of the
LDL receptor. Both in the fibroblasts of the patient and in transfected
COS-1 cells, the mutant protein showed impaired processing and rapid
degradation. Members of the family carrying the mutant gene in
heterozygous state showed higher serum cholesterol levels than the
others; however, cholesterol levels were also influenced by the
apolipoprotein E phenotype. The mutant LDLR reported by Miyake et al.
(1992) is designated here FH Osaka-3.

.0051
FH AFRIKANER 4
LDLR, 18-BP DUP

Kotze et al. (1995) identified a de novo duplication in the LDLR gene in
the course of screening hypercholesterolemics who did not have 1 of the
3 known mutations responsible for the high frequency of FH (143890)
(more than 1/100) in South African Afrikaners. The de novo duplication
of 18 basepairs in exon 4 occurred after nucleotide 678 (or 681) of
their sequence. The authors suggested that the resultant change is
severe, because the corresponding duplicated amino acids 200-205 (or
201-206) are highly conserved in E/apo B binding repeat 5 of LDLC. One
of the daughters of the index patient inherited the defective LDLR gene,
which was absent in both grandparents. Kotze et al. (1995) suggested
that this was the first report of a molecularly characterized de novo
mutation associated with FH.

.0052
FH TURKU
LDLR, GLY823ASP

Two deletions, designated FH-Helsinki (143890.0029) and FH-North Karelia
(143890.0047), account for the mutations present in approximately 60 to
70% of all heterozygous FH (143890) probands in Finland. Koivisto et al.
(1995) screened the DNA samples from a cohort representing the remaining
30% of heterozygous patients by amplifying all 18 exons of the LDLR gene
by PCR and searching for DNA variations with the SSCP technique. Ten
novel mutations were identified, comprising 2 nonsense and 7 missense
mutations, as well as 1 frameshift mutation caused by a 13-bp deletion.
Koivisto et al. (1995) found a single nucleotide change, substituting
adenine for guanine at position 2533 of their sequence and resulting in
a gly823-to-asp amino acid change, in DNA samples from 14 unrelated FH
probands. The mutation, designated FH-Turku, affected the sequence
encoding the putative basolateral sorting signal of the LDL receptor
protein. The FH-Turku gene and another point mutation, FH-Pori (leu380
to his; 606945.0053), accounted for approximately 8% of the FH-causing
gene alterations in Finland and were found to be particularly common
among FH patients from the southwestern part of the country. The
FH-Turku missense mutation was the one closest to the C terminus of LDLR
identified to date.

Koivisto et al. (2001) showed that the FH-Turku mutant receptor is
mistargeted to the apical surface in both Madin-Darby canine kidney
(MDCK) cells and hepatic epithelial cells, resulting in reduced
endocytosis of LDL from the basolateral/sinusoidal surface.
Consequently, virally encoded mutant receptor fails to mediate
cholesterol clearance in LDL receptor-deficient mice, suggesting that a
defect in polarized LDL receptor expression in hepatocytes underlies the
hypercholesterolemia in patients harboring this allele. This evidence
directly links the pathogenesis of a human disease to defects in
basolateral targeting signals, providing a genetic confirmation of these
signals in maintaining epithelial cell polarity.

LDLR, IVS3, G-A, +1

In Norway, Leren et al. (1994) identified a splice mutation, a G-to-A
change of the first base of intron 3 destroying the conserved GT splice
donor site of intron 3 of the LDLR gene. The same mutation was reported
in patients with FH (143890) in England (Sun et al., 1995) and Germany
(Feussner et al., 1996).

.0055
FH AARHUS
LDLR, ASN543HIS AND 9-BP DEL

During a survey of mutations of the LDL receptor gene in Danish patients
with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890), using SSCP analysis, Jensen
et al. (1997) observed different patterns in exons 11 and 17 from 2
apparently unrelated FH index cases indicating the presence of 2
different mutations. No other mutations were identified by analysis of
the remaining 16 exons and the promoter region. The mutation in exon 11
was found to be a 1690A-C transversion, causing an N543H amino acid
substitution. In exon 17, they identified a 9-bp deletion of nucleotides
2393-2405 (2393del9). This sequence contains a 4-bp repeat of the
nucleotides TCCT at the end. It was therefore likely that the 9-bp
deletion had occurred due to 'slipped mispairing mutagenesis,' involving
mispairing of the 4-bp repeat during replication. The deletion did not
cause a frameshift, and the mutant allele coded, therefore, for an LDL
receptor protein lacking 3 amino acids in the membrane-spanning domain:
leu778, val779, and phe780. The 2 mutations were in the same allele of
the LDLR gene. Each of these mutations alone had little or no effect on
receptor function in transfected COS cells, but when both mutations were
present simultaneously, receptor function, as assessed by flow
cytometric measurement of fluorescent LDL uptake in cells, was reduced
by 75%. Immunostainable receptors on the cell surface were decreased by
80% as measured by flow cytometry. The 2 mutations therefore acted in
synergy to affect receptor function, possibly during intracellular
receptor transport, since Northern blot analysis suggested that mRNA
levels were unaffected. Jensen et al. (1997) noted that double mutations
had been reported in several clinically relevant genes, such as the HEXA
gene (606869.0036) and the CFTR gene (602421) (Savov et al., 1995). In
most of these disorders, one mutation was found to be causative, and the
other modified the onset or severity of the disease. The common
methionine-valine polymorphism in the PRNP gene (176640.0005) modifies
both qualitatively and quantitatively the phenotypic expression of the
pathogenic D178N mutation (176640.0010) resulting in 2 different
disorders: fatal familial insomnia and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (Goldfarb et al., 1992). Jensen et al. (1997) stated that in the
case of the LDLR double mutant, there appeared to be a true synergistic
action.

.0056
FH ICELAND
LDLR, IVS4, T-C, +2

Gudnason et al. (1997) stated that haplotype analysis in 18 apparently
unrelated families with FH (143890) in Iceland has identified at least 5
different chromosomes cosegregating with hypercholesterolemia. The most
common haplotype was identified in 11 of the 18 families, indicating a
founder mutation. By using SSCP analysis and direct sequencing of
amplified DNA, Gudnason et al. (1997) identified a T-to-C transition in
the second nucleotide in the 5-prime part of intron 4 of the LDLR gene.
This mutation was present in 10 of the 18 families. In half of the
cases, these families could be traced to a common ancestor by going back
no further than the 18th century. The mutation was predicted to affect
correct splicing of exon 4, and analysis at the cellular level
demonstrated an abnormal mRNA containing intron 4 sequence in
lymphoblastoid cells from a patient carrying the mutation. Translation
of the mRNA would lead to a premature stop codon and a truncated
nonfunctional protein of 285 amino acids.

.0058
FH GLASCO
LDLR, CYS163TYR

Lee et al. (1998) reported that in the West of Scotland, in the Glasco
area, about half of the index cases of familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890) were found to have the cys163-to-tyr mutation of the LDLR gene.

.0059
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, CYS240PHE

In a 13-year-old girl with severe hypercholesterolemia (143890), Ekstrom
et al. (1999) demonstrated compound heterozygosity for a cys240-to-phe
mutation and a tyr167-to-ter mutation (606945.0045) in the LDLR gene.
Fibroblasts from the patient showed very low cholesterol esterification
rate, LDL uptake, and degradation as compared to normal fibroblasts. Her
2 heterozygous sibs also carried the C240F mutation, but only one of
them was hypercholesterolemic. Ekstrom et al. (1999) expressed the C240F
mutant in LDLR-deficient CHOldlA7 cells. The transfected cells produced
a detectable protein but were unable to mediate uptake or degradation of
LDL. The authors concluded that there may be cholesterol-lowering
mechanisms that can be activated, perhaps by mutations in known or
hitherto unknown genes.

.0060
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL

In patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890), Hobbs et al.

.0061
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, CYS25SER

In a Japanese patient with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890),
Takahashi et al. (2001) identified a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide
137 of the LDLR gene, resulting in a cys25-to-ser (C25S) amino acid
substitution in the ligand-binding site (mutation class 2B: slow
transport and processing). The patient first noticed xanthomas on both
elbows at the age of 5 years. These continued to increase in number and
size. At age 40 years, xanthomas were present on elbows, palms, knees,
and feet. Clinical manifestations of myocardial ischemia developed at
age 41. Selective LDL filtration was initiated after plasma apheresis
through a macromolecular exclusion filter. With bimonthly treatments,
her LDL cholesterol decreased by approximately 50% and the xanthomas
regressed markedly, almost disappearing with 5 years of treatment.

.0062
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, CYS88SER

Pisciotta et al. (2002) identified a de novo LDLR mutation in a
47-year-old white male who at the age of 43 had suffered a myocardial
infarction. He was heterozygous for a G-to-C transversion in exon 4,
which resulted in a serine for cysteine substitution at position 88
(C88S) of the receptor protein. The mutation was not found in his
parents (nonpaternity was excluded), but it was present in his
9-year-old son, who had familial hypercholesterolemia (143890).
Haplotype analysis indicated that this de novo mutation occurred in the
paternal germline.

.0063
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, IVS14, G-A, +1

Takada et al. (2002) described a novel splice site mutation in the LDLR
gene, IVS14+1G-A, which genealogic research confirmed was shared by 14
of 1,135 members of an American Caucasian pedigree descended from a
common ancestor and affected with familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890). The mutation resulted in an abruptly truncated LDLR protein,
reducing functional LDLR activity by half in heterozygous carriers of
the mutant allele. Takada et al. (2002) stated this was the largest
familial hypercholesterolemia kindred described, and of 208 members
screened for this LDLR mutation, 94 carriers and 114 noncarriers were
identified. Strikingly lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol
values were observed among most of the LDLR mutation carriers who were
simultaneously homozygous for the -265C allele of the -265C-T
polymorphism of the APOA2 gene (107670.0002). In vitro transfection
assays showed that transcriptional activity of the APOA2 promoter was
reduced by 30% in the -265C allele as compared with the -265T allele.
The variant of the APOA2 gene was associated with reduced plasma LDL
cholesterol only in familial hypercholesterolemia patients.

In the same large family reported by Takada et al. (2002), Takada et al.
(2003) found that a SNP in the growth hormone receptor gene (GHR),
resulting in a L526I (600946.0028) substitution, influenced plasma
levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in affected family
members with the LDLR mutation. The lowest levels of plasma HDL were
observed among leu/leu homozygotes, highest levels among ile/ile
homozygotes, and intermediate levels among leu/ile heterozygotes. No
such effect was observed among noncarriers of the LDLR mutation.

In the pedigree reported by Takada et al. (2002), Sato et al. (2004)
demonstrated a significant modification of the phenotype of familial
hypercholesterolemia resulting from the IVS14+1G-A mutation by the
arg287 variation in the EPHX2 gene (132811.0001).

.0064
FH PYRGOS
LDLR, -45T DEL

In a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia (143890), Dedoussis et
al. (2003) identified a novel mutation in repeat 3 of the LDLR gene
promoter, -45delT. Analysis of a neutral polymorphism in LDLR mRNA from
the patient's white blood cells showed that the expression of 1 allele
was significantly reduced, and cells had only 24% of LDLR activity by
binding and uptake of iodine-labeled LDL. Transient transfection studies
using a luciferase gene reporter revealed that the -45delT mutation
considerably reduced the transcriptional activity of the LDLR promoter
and strongly suggested that the mutation was the cause of the familial
hypercholesterolemia phenotype. The proband was a female in her late
thirties; her father was reported to have elevated cholesterol levels
and had undergone bypass surgery at the age of 70.

.0065
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, ARG385ARG

In a patient diagnosed with probable heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia (143890), who had tendinous xanthomas and angina
since the age of 29 years, Bourbon et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1216C-A transversion in exon 9 of the LDLR gene,
resulting in a synonymous arg385-to-arg (R385R) change. However,
analysis of mRNA from the patient's cells showed that the mutation
introduces a new 5-prime acceptor splice site that is used to the
exclusion of the natural splice site and causes a 31-bp deletion
predicted to result in premature termination 4 codons beyond the change.
Review of previous LDLR gene sequencing data revealed that the same base
substitution was present in a Chinese homozygous FH patient in whom no
other mutation in LDLR had been found. The authors stated that the
difference in origins of the 2 patients suggested that the mutation was
very unlikely to have been inherited from a common ancestor and that it
might be present in other populations as well.

Defesche et al. (2008) analyzed the LDLR gene in 1,350 patients
clinically diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia who were
negative for functional DNA variation in known hypercholesterolemia
genes and identified the R385R variant in 2 probands, both of Chinese
origin, and their family members. In view of the faint band representing
the aberrantly spliced mRNA on gel electrophoresis, the authors
suggested that this DNA variant likely leads to nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay.

.0066
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, GLY186GLY

In 35 unrelated Dutch patients clinically diagnosed with familial
hypercholesterolemia who were negative for functional DNA variation in
known hypercholesterolemia genes, Defesche et al. (2008) identified a
621C-T transition in exon 4 of the LDLR gene, resulting in a synonymous
gly186-to-gly (G186G) change, that introduces a 3-prime splice donor
site with a higher 'probability score' than the naturally occurring
3-prime splice site 75 bp downstream. Analysis of cDNA synthesized from
total RNA revealed that the aberrant splicing results in a 75-bp
in-frame deletion and a stable mRNA, predicted to produce an LDLR
protein lacking a 25-amino acid fragment (gly186 to cys210). The variant
was found in homozygosity in 2 of the probands, who had LDL cholesterol
levels of 14.8 and 10.5 mmol/L, respectively, and who both suffered
myocardial infarctions before the age of 20 years. The variant was also
identified in 62 first-degree relatives of the index cases.

.0067
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA, FAMILIAL
LDLR, IVS14, C-G, +86

In a proband with clinically defined hypercholesterolemia (143890),
Kulseth et al. (2010) identified heterozygosity for a splice site
mutation (2140+86C-G) in intron 14 of the LDLR gene, activating a
cryptic splice site that results in aberrantly spliced mRNA containing
an 81-bp insertion. Twelve of 23 family members tested were heterozygous
for the mutation, and carriers had significantly increased total
cholesterol levels compared to noncarriers. The 2140+86C-G mutation was
found in 3 additional probands with hypercholesterolemia, and in 1
proband's family the mutation was found in 6 of 7 tested family members,
who all had LDL cholesterol levels above the 97th percentile. RT-PCR
analysis in 1 affected individual from that family showed that the
mutant allele mainly gave rise to aberrantly spliced mRNA, but
contributed 21% normal transcripts. Transfection studies in CHO cells
demonstrated retention of mutant LDLR in the endoplasmic reticulum,
presumably due to protein misfolding.

607179	TITLE *607179 RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 12; RBM12
;;KIAA0765
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Stover et al. (2001) cloned a partial cDNA encoding a member of the
RNA-binding motif protein family, RBM12, from a human colon carcinoma
cell line cDNA library. They cloned the full-length cDNA from an acute
monocytic leukemia cell line cDNA library and found that it is identical
to a partial cDNA, KIAA0765, isolated from a brain cDNA library by
Nagase et al. (1998). The full-length cDNA encodes a deduced 932-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 97 kD. It contains 5
RNA-binding motifs, several potential transmembrane domains, and 2
proline-rich regions that coincide with 2 of the transmembrane domains.
The RBM12 protein has a nuclear targeting sequence and a mitochondrial
targeting sequence, but no signal sequence. Northern blot analysis
detected abundant expression of a 3.5-kb transcript in all cell lines
tested.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stover et al. (2001) determined that the RBM12 gene contains 2 exons and
spans approximately 10 kb. The structure of the gene is unusual in that
its 1 intron is located in the 5-prime untranslated region and the
complete coding sequence is transcribed from a single exon. Southern
blot analysis indicated that RBM12 is present in single copy.

MAPPING

By FISH, Stover et al. (2001) mapped the RBM12 gene to chromosome
20q11.2.

606210	TITLE *606210 SELENOPROTEIN N, 1; SEPN1
;;SELN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Selenium deficiency can interfere with normal embryonic development and
fertility or promote the occurrence of certain cancers and viral
diseases. Selenocysteine, the major form of selenium in animals, is
directly involved in the catalytic reaction of selenoproteins.
Selenocysteine is encoded by an in-frame UGA codon. Avoidance of a
translational stop requires the presence of a selenocysteine insertion
sequence (SECIS), a hairpin conserved in the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR) of all selenoprotein mRNAs. By searching an EST database for
sequences that can adopt a SECIS-like secondary structure, followed by
glutathione peroxidase functional analysis, further database searching,
and 5-prime RACE, Lescure et al. (1999) identified a partial cDNA
encoding SEPN1, which they termed SELN. Sequence analysis detected a
SECIS in the 3-prime UTR of SEPN1. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of a 4.5-kb SEPN1 transcript, with highest levels
in pancreas, ovary, prostate, and spleen. Hemagglutinin-tagged SEPN1 was
expressed as a 60-kD protein in the presence of a wildtype SECIS element
but not a mutant SECIS element. Lescure et al. (1999) concluded that the
3-prime UTR is a repository of functional RNA motifs instrumental in
posttranscriptional control.

By 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001)
characterized the full-length SEPN1 cDNA. They found that SEPN1 produces
a 4.5-kb transcript with an open reading frame encoding a 590-amino acid
protein. EST database searches and RT-PCR experiments predicted that
there are 2 isoforms of SEPN1. Isoform 1 corresponds to the full-length
transcript, whereas exon 3 is spliced out in isoform 2. Both transcripts
were detected in skeletal muscle, brain, lung, and placenta, but isoform
2 was always predominant. The exon 3 sequence corresponds to an Alu
cassette and contains a second in-frame selenocysteine codon.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) determined
that the SEPN1 gene contains 13 exons and spans 18.5 kb.

MAPPING

By PAC analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) mapped the SEPN1 gene to
1p36-p35, where the locus for rigid spine muscular dystrophy-1 (RSMD1;
602771) maps.

GENE FUNCTION

Using polyclonal antibodies directed against SEPN1 and cDNA constructs
encoding the 2 isoforms, Petit et al. (2003) showed that the main SEPN1
gene product corresponds to a 70-kD protein containing a single
selenocysteine residue. Subcellular fractionation experiments and
endoglycosidase H sensitivity indicated that SEPN1 is a glycoprotein
localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Immunofluorescence
analyses confirmed this subcellular localization, and GFP fusion
experiments demonstrated the presence of an ER-addressing and -retention
signal within the N terminus. SEPN1 was present at a high level in
several human fetal tissues and at a lower level in adult tissues,
including skeletal muscle. Its high expression in cultured myoblasts was
also downregulated in differentiating myotubes, suggesting a role for
SEPN1 in early development and in cell proliferation or regeneration.

Jurynec et al. (2008) found that the zebrafish ortholog of Sepn1 was
required for development of the slow muscle fiber lineage.
Downregulation of Sepn1 resulted in disorganized muscle myofibrils and
prominent Z-band anomalies not seen in wildtype muscle. Ryr1a (see RYR1;
180901) and Ryr3 (180903) were also required for formation of
normal-appearing slow muscle cells. Sepn1 stably associated with Ryr
proteins and functioned as a modifier of Ryr calcium flux activity and
redox responsiveness.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The association between selenium deficiency and muscular dystrophy in
livestock suggests a role for selenium in the pathophysiology of
striated muscles. In humans, selenium deficiency is associated with a
cardiomyopathy known as Keshan disease, reported from selenium-deficient
areas of China (Ge et al., 1983). In 10 families with RSMD1,
Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified 2 frameshift, 1 nonsense, and 3
missense mutations in the SEPN1 gene. The nonsense mutation
(606210.0002) identified in a French family transformed the
selenocysteine codon into a stop codon, preventing selenocysteine
incorporation and leading to a shorter protein. The missense mutations
changed residues that are conserved in vertebrates. Two of these mutated
residues were clustered in 1 region, the third being in close proximity
to the selenocysteine residue.

Multiminicore disease is an autosomal recessive congenital myopathy
characterized by the presence of multiple, short core lesions (known as
minicores) in most muscle fibers. On the basis of clinical and
morphologic data, Ferreiro et al. (2002) suspected a relationship
between classic multiminicore disease and RSMD1 due to mutation in the
SEPN1 gene. A genomewide screen, followed by the analysis of 1p36
microsatellite markers in 27 informative families with multiminicore
disease, demonstrated linkage to the RSMD1 locus in 8 families. All
showed axial myopathy with scoliosis and respiratory failure, consistent
with the most severe end of the classic multiminicore disease spectrum;
spinal rigidity was evident in some, but not all, patients. Screening of
SEPN1 in the 8 families that showed linkage and in 14 patients with
classic sporadic disease revealed 9 mutations affecting 17 patients in
12 families; 6 were novel mutations and 3 had been described in patients
with RSMD1. Analysis of 3 deltoid biopsy specimens from patients with
typical RSMD revealed a wide myopathologic variability, ranging from a
dystrophic to a congenital myopathy pattern. A variable proportion of
minicores was found in all samples. The authors concluded that RSMD1 and
the most severe form of classic multiminicore disease are the same
entity.

Clarke et al. (2006) identified a homozygous mutation in the SEPN1 gene
(606210.0008) in patients with congenital fiber-type disproportion
(CFTD; 255310), a congenital muscular dystrophy that has clinical
features similar to those observed in RSMD1.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, GLY273GLU

In affected members of 2 Iranian and 3 Turkish families with rigid spine
muscular dystrophy-1 (602771), Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 817 of the SEPN1 gene, causing a
gly273-to-glu substitution.

.0002
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, SEC462TER

In a French family with rigid spine muscular dystrophy (602771),
Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide
1385 of the SEPN1 gene. The mutation changed the selenocysteine (sec)
codon (TGA) into a stop codon (TAA), preventing selenocysteine
incorporation and leading to a shorter protein.

.0003
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, MET1VAL

In 3 unrelated families of Italian, Belgian, and German origin with
multiminicore disease (602771), Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified a
homozygous A-to-G transition in the start codon of the SEPN1 gene,
resulting in a met1-to-val (M1V) substitution. In the family from
Germany consanguinity was known. Two children in the family from Italy
were affected.

.0004
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, ARG466GLN

In patients with rigid spine muscular dystrophy (602771), Moghadaszadeh
et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 1397 of the SEPN1 gene, resulting in an arg466-to-gln (R466Q)
substitution.

In patients with multiminicore disease, Ferreiro et al. (2002)
identified the R466Q mutation in compound heterozygous state with a
trp453-to-ser (W453S) substitution resulting from a G-to-C transversion
at nucleotide 1358 (606210.0005). They also identified the R466Q
mutation in a compound heterozygous state with a 1-bp insertion (A) at
nucleotide 713 (606210.0006), resulting in a frameshift.

Jurynec et al. (2008) found that ryanodine receptors (RYRs; see 180901)
in muscle lysates prepared from muscle from a patient with congenital
myopathy and the R466Q mutation showed reduced ryanodine binding
compared with control tissue. Addition of wildtype zebrafish Sepn1
partially restored the binding capacity of diseased muscle lysates and
fully restored the ability of human RYRs from diseased muscle lysates to
respond to changes in the redox potential of the binding environment.

RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, SEC462GLY

In a Portuguese family in which 2 children had multiminicore disease
(602771), Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a T-to-G
transversion at nucleotide 1384 in exon 10 of the SEPN1 gene, resulting
in a sec462-to-gly (U462G) substitution.

.0008
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
MYOPATHY, CONGENITAL, WITH FIBER-TYPE DISPROPORTION, INCLUDED
SEPN1, GLY315SER

In 2 unrelated families with multiminicore disease (602771) from Belgium
and the U.K. that shared identical RSMD1 haplotypes, suggesting a
founder effect, Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a
943G-A transition in the SEPN1 gene, resulting in a gly315-to-ser
(G315S) substitution. A German patient with sporadic multiminicore
disease presented the same mutation in the compound heterozygous state
with R466Q (606210.0004).

Venance et al. (2005) identified the homozygous G315S mutation in a
patient with rigid spine muscular dystrophy who presented at age 26
years with cor pulmonale characterized by rapidly progressive
respiratory and right heart failure with cough, orthopnea, and daytime
sleepiness. Two sibs who were heterozygous carriers of the mutation had
mild neck restriction. Venance et al. (2005) emphasized the importance
of early nocturnal ventilatory assistance in these patients.

Clarke et al. (2006) reported 2 sisters, ages 32 and 30, respectively,
with a diagnosis of congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD; 255310)
who were homozygous for the G315S substitution. Skeletal muscle biopsies
showed that type 1 fibers were at least 12% smaller than type 2 fibers,
and there was no evidence of multiminicore disease or other findings
typical of RSMD1. Clinically, the women had a severe congenital myopathy
with truncal hypotonia in infancy, progressive scoliosis, progressive
respiratory impairment, and osteopenia. One woman was wheelchair-bound
and had had bilateral hip fractures in her twenties. Three additional
patients from another family with congenital muscular dystrophy were
homozygous for the G315S substitution; however, skeletal muscle biopsy
from 1 of these patients showed only nonspecific myopathy and did not
fulfill the pathologic criteria for CFTD. All 5 patients had abnormal
glucose tolerance tests and showed biochemical abnormalities suggesting
insulin resistance.

.0009
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, 92-BP DEL

In 4 affected patients with Mallory-body myopathy (602771) who came from
a genetic isolate in northern Germany (Goebel et al., 1980), Ferreiro et
al. (2004) identified a homozygous 92-bp deletion in the SEPN1 gene
starting 19 bp upstream of exon 1 and including the first 73 bp of exon
1 (del92, -19/+73). The deletion caused loss of the translation starting
codon. The parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

610610	TITLE *610610 GINS COMPLEX SUBUNIT 3; GINS3
;;PSF3, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; PSF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The yeast heterotetrameric GINS complex is made up of Sld5 (GINS4;
610611), Psf1 (GINS1; 610608), Psf2 (GINS2; 610609), and Psf3. The
formation of the GINS complex is essential for the initiation of DNA
replication in yeast and Xenopus egg extracts (Ueno et al., 2005). See
GINS1 for additional information about the GINS complex.

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to yeast Psf3,
Takayama et al. (2003) identified GINS3, which they called PSF3. The
deduced protein contains 216 amino acids.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GINS3
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP RH65173).

NOMENCLATURE

The GINS complex derives its name from the Japanese words Go, Ichi, Nii,
and San, which mean 5, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and refer to the
numbering of the yeast homologs of the GINS complex (Takayama et al.,
2003).

613741	TITLE *613741 GLYCOGEN PHOSPHORYLASE, LIVER; PYGL
;;LGP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphorylases (EC 2.4.1.1), such as PYGL, remove glycosyl units from
the terminal branches of glycogen through phosphorolysis, forming
glucose 1-phosphate. During stress, exercise, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia,
phosphorylase activity is primarily regulated by interconversion of the
active phosphorylated form and the inactive, nonphosphorylated form
(summary by Ercan-Fang et al., 2002).

CLONING

Newgard et al. (1986) reported the cDNA sequence encoding human liver
glycogen phosphorylase. The deduced protein contains 845 amino acids.

Burwinkel et al. (1998) reported corrections in the previously reported
PYGL coding sequence and polymorphisms in that sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

Burwinkel et al. (1998) reported a partial PYGL gene structure showing
introns in the same positions as in PYGM (608455), which encodes the
muscle isoform of phosphorylase.

MAPPING

By the method of chromosome sorting and spot blotting, Newgard et al.
(1987) assigned the structural gene for hepatic phosphorylase to
chromosome 14. The gene in the mouse maps to chromosome 12 (Glaser et
al., 1989).

Gross (2011) mapped the PYGL gene to chromosome 14q22.1 based on an
alignment of the PYGL sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF046785) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells, Ercan-Fang et al.
(2002) measured the effects of small molecular mass molecules on the
phosphorylase activities of the rat and human LGP active forms (LGPa).
When added individually at estimated physiologic concentrations, AMP
stimulated, whereas ADP, ATP, and glucose inhibited, both enzymes.
However, glucose inhibition was about 2-fold more potent with the human
enzyme. UDP-glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, and fructose 1-phosphate were
only minor inhibitors of both enzymes. When all effectors were present
in combination at estimated intracellular concentrations, the net effect
reduced human LGPa activity, but it had little effect on rat Lgpa
activity. This inhibition of human LGPa was glucose dependent.
Ercan-Fang et al. (2002) concluded that glucose may be a major regulator
of human LGPa activity, since glucose concentration changes greatly with
feeding and fasting.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 patients with glycogen storage disease VI (GSD6; 232700), also
known as Hers disease, Burwinkel et al. (1998) identified mutations in
the PYGL gene in homozygous or compound heterozygous state
(613741.0001-613741.0004).

By sequencing genomic DNA in a Mennonite family segregating glycogen
storage disease VI, Chang et al. (1998) identified a homozygous
abnormality of the intron 13 splice donor (613741.0005). This mutation
was estimated to be present on 3% of Mennonite chromosomes.

EVOLUTION

Newgard et al. (1986) compared the human liver phosphorylase cDNA
sequence with the previously determined rabbit muscle phosphorylase
sequence. Despite an amino acid identity of 80%, the 2 cDNAs exhibited a
remarkable divergence in G+C content. In the sequence for muscle
phosphorylase, 86% of the nucleotides at the third codon position are
either deoxyguanosine or deoxycytidine residues whereas in the liver
homolog the figure is only 60%. The liver phosphorylase cDNA appeared to
represent an evolutionary mosaic; the segment encoding the N-terminal 80
amino acids contained more than 90% G+C at the third codon position.
Newgard et al. (1986) proposed that the high G+C content in the
N-terminal region of the liver message indicates that this segment was
spliced onto the liver gene from the muscle gene long after the
divergence of liver and muscle tissues. This appears to be evidence for
exon shuffling as proposed by Gilbert (1978). Newgard et al. (1986)
considered it of interest, however, that organisms such as the
thermophilic bacteria and the protozoan Leischmania, which are exposed
to environmental stresses of high temperature and low pH, respectively,
have high G+C content in their coding sequences, presumably because the
greatest stability of G-C basepairs aids the processes of gene
replication, transcription, and, to a lesser extent, translation.
Possibly skeletal muscle, which undergoes a fall in pH and a rise in
temperature during exercise, represents a similarly stressful
environment that selectively maintains high G+C content in expressed
genes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, IVS14DS, G-A, +1

In a 4.5-year-old boy with glycogen storage disease VI (232700), the son
of first-cousin Israeli-Arab Bedouin parents, Burwinkel et al. (1998)
described a splice site mutation. The patient presented at 2 years of
age with hepatomegaly and growth retardation, but had no clinical
history of fasting hypoglycemia. He was found to be homozygous for an
insertion of 119 nucleotides in codon R589, resulting in a frameshift
and introducing a stop codon after 5 missense codons. Sequencing showed
that the insert was an intron, presumably intron 14, but with a G-to-A
replacement in the GT consensus dinucleotide of the 5-prime splice site.
This splice site mutation thus led to the retention of intron 14 and 2
aberrant splice products employing neighboring GT dinucleotides in exon
14 and in intron 14, respectively, as illegitimate 5-prime splice sites.
Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, IVS4AS, G-C, -1

In a boy with glycogen storage disease VI (232700), the son of unrelated
and healthy parents of Suriname Hindustani background, Burwinkel et al.
(1998) identified a splice site mutation in the PYGL gene.. The patient
presented at age 2 years with hepatomegaly and severe growth
retardation. Transaminases were intermittently elevated. Marked glycogen
storage in hepatocytes was demonstrated. There was no known parental
consanguinity. The child was found to be heterozygous for a G-to-C
substitution in the AG consensus of the 3-prime splice site of intron 4
of the PYGL gene. Two missense mutations, val221 to ile (V221I) and
asn338 to ser (N338S), were found on the other allele. Burwinkel et al.
(1998) thought that the N338S mutation was probably the second disease
mutation because codon N338 is absolutely conserved in all 3 isoforms of
glycogen phosphorylase and also conserved in plants, yeast, and
bacterial phosphorylases; the same cannot be said for the V221.

In a girl with glycogen storage disease VI (232700), the daughter of
consanguineous Turkish parents, Burwinkel et al. (1998) found
homozygosity for an asn376-to-lys missense (N376K) mutation in the PYGL
gene. The patient presented with hepatomegaly at the age of 1 year. Body
length was at the fiftieth percentile, but weight was at the tenth
percentile. Transaminases, triglycerides, and cholesterol were elevated.
There was a heavy accumulation of glycogen in the liver.

.0005
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, IVS13DS, G-A, +1

In affected members of a Mennonite kindred with an autosomal recessive
form of glycogen storage disease (232700), Chang et al. (1998) found
that the consensus GT at the splice donor site of intron 13 was
converted to AT in the PYGL gene. This mutation predicts a PYGL protein
with a deletion of either 3 or 34 amino acids.

238310	TITLE *238310 AMINOMETHYLTRANSFERASE; AMT
;;GLYCINE CLEAVAGE SYSTEM T PROTEIN; GCST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The enzyme system for cleavage of glycine (glycine cleavage system; EC
2.1.2.10), which is confined to the mitochondria, is composed of 4
protein components: P protein (a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent glycine
decarboxylase; GLDC, 238300), H protein (a lipoic acid-containing
protein; GCSH, 238330), T protein (a tetrahydrofolate-requiring enzyme),
and L protein (a lipoamide dehydrogenase; DLD, 238331).

Mutations in the T, P, and H proteins have been found to cause glycine
encephalopathy (GCE; 605899).

CLONING

The T protein of the glycine cleavage system is also known as
aminomethyltransferase (AMT). Nanao et al. (1994) isolated the AMT gene
from a human placenta cosmid library. They found that the gene is about
6 kb long and contains 9 exons. They identified 2 putative
glucocorticoid-responsive elements and a putative thyroid
hormone-responsive element. By dot-blot analysis, Kure et al. (2001)
detected expression of AMT in all tissues tested except stomach and bone
marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakata et al. (2001) reported the structure and expression of the
glycine cleavage system in rat central nervous system.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nanao et al. (1994) assigned the
AMT gene to 3p21.2-p21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with glycine encephalopathy, Nanao et al. (1994) identified
mutations in the AMT gene (238310.0001-238310.0002).

Toone et al. (2000) studied 14 unrelated patients with glycine
encephalopathy and identified mutations in 4 cases. In 2 patients,
mutations were identified in the T protein: 1 patient was homozygous for
an arg320-to-his mutation (R320H; 238310.0006), and the other patient
was heterozygous for a novel glutamine-to-termination substitution at
codon 192 (238310.0007).

Applegarth and Toone (2001) reviewed the laboratory diagnosis of glycine
encephalopathy and confirmed 9 mutations in the T protein and 8
mutations in the P protein. They also reviewed the 7 cases of transient
NKH known at that time.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY269ASP

Nanao et al. (1994) found that a patient with typical glycine
encephalopathy (605899) was homozygous for a missense mutation in the
AMT gene, a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-asp substitution at
amino acid 269 (G269D).

.0002
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY47ARG

In 2 sisters with atypical glycine encephalopathy (605899), Nanao et al.
(1994) found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the T
protein gene: a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-arg substitution
at amino acid 47 (G47R) in 1 allele, and a G-to-A transition leading to
an arg-to-his substitution at amino acid 320 (R320H; 238310.0006) in the
other allele. Nanao et al. (1994) pointed out that gly269, which was
mutant in the typically severe case they studied (see 238300.0001), is
conserved in T proteins of various species, even in E. coli, whereas
gly47 and arg320, which were mutant in the atypical and milder cases,
are replaced by ala and leu, respectively, in E. coli. Thus, mutation
occurring in more conservative amino acid residues results in more
deleterious damage to the T protein and a more severe clinical
phenotype.

.0003
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, HIS42ARG

Kure et al. (1998) reported a large Israeli-Arab kindred with glycine
encephalopathy (605899). Enzymatic analysis demonstrated that T-protein
activity was deficient in the liver from 1 affected person in the
family. Mutation detection revealed a missense mutation in exon 2
resulting in an amino acid substitution from histidine to arginine at
position 42 (his42 to arg). Homozygosity for the H42R mutation was seen
in all affected members of the family.

.0004
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY

610243	TITLE *610243 ZINC FINGER FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 27; ZFYVE27
;;PROTRUDIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mannan et al. (2006) identified ZFYVE27 as a potential spastin
(604277)-interacting protein in a yeast 2-hybrid assay. They described 4
splice variants of ZFYVE27. Transient transfection of HeLa cells with
epitope-tagged ZFYVE27 constructs revealed that ZFYVE27 is predominantly
expressed in punctate vesicles, although a tubular pattern of expression
was observed in a small proportion of cells. Colocalization studies
detected overlapping expression with the endosomal marker EEA1 (605070)
and the endoplasmic reticulum marker RTN1 (600865).
Coimmunoprecipitation studies in NIH3T3 cells determined that spastin
mediates interaction with ZFYVE27 through its N-terminal domain, which
consists of an MIT (microtubule-interacting and trafficking) motif. An
immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the interaction of endogenous
spastin with ZFYVE27.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mannan et al. (2006) determined that the ZFYVE27 gene consists of 13
exons.

MAPPING

Mannan et al. (2006) noted that the ZFYVE27 gene maps to chromosome
10q24.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Shirane and Nakayama (2006) identified protrudin as a mammalian protein
that promoted neurite formation through interaction with the guanosine
diphosphate (GDP)-bound form of Rab11 (see 605570). Phosphorylation of
protrudin by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; 600997) in
response to nerve growth factor (NGFB; 162030) promoted protrudin
association with Rab11-GDP. Downregulation of protrudin by RNA
interference induced membrane extension in all directions and inhibited
neurite formation. Thus, Shirane and Nakayama (2006) concluded that
protrudin regulates Rab11-dependent membrane recycling to promote the
directional membrane trafficking required for neurite formation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 5-generation German family with hereditary spastic paraplegia
(SPG33; 610244), Mannan et al. (2006) detected a missense mutation in
the ZFYVE27 gene (610243.0001) that segregated with the clinical
phenotype in affected individuals. Mannan et al. (2006) postulated that
this mutation affects neuronal intracellular trafficking in the cortical
spinal tract, which is consistent with the pathology of hereditary
spastic paraplegia. Mannan et al. (2006) excluded the ZFYVE27 gene from
both the SPG9 (601162) and the SPG27 (609041) loci.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 33, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ZFYVE27, GLY191VAL

In affected members of a 5-generation German family with hereditary
spastic paraplegia (SPG33; 610244), Mannan et al. (2006) found a G-to-T
transversion at position 572 in exon 6 of the ZFYVE27 cDNA. The mutation
produced a gly191-to-val (G191V) substitution. The G191V mutation (G105V
in isoform c of the protein) is located near the third transmembrane
motif and shifts the transmembrane motif forward by 3 amino acids.
Mannan et al. (2006) observed that expression of the mutated protein
showed an aberrant intracellular pattern in tubular structures and that
its interaction with spastin was severely affected.

Martignoni et al. (2008) commented that they found no difference in the
ability of wildtype or G191V-mutant protrudin to extend neurites in
cellular functional expression studies. The G191V-mutant protein was
also found to interact with Rab11-GDP (605570) and spastin (604277),
indicating that the mutation did not lead to loss of function.
Martignoni et al. (2008) stated that G191V (dbSNP rs35077384) had been
identified as a SNP in several populations, with an allele frequency
ranging from 0.008 to 0.067, thus casting doubt on the pathogenicity of
this mutation. Mannan (2008) replied that their studies showed a
decreased interaction between G191V-mutant protrudin and spastin and
explained that discrepancies could be due to the different assays used
or the variable effect of G191V-mutant protrudin in different ethnic
populations.

;;ZFD25;;
ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 588, FORMERLY; ZNF588, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs), which bind nucleic acids, perform many key
functions, the most important of which is regulating transcription. See
ZNF91 (603971) for general information on ZNFs.

CLONING

By PCR-based screening of a human genomic YAC library using degenerate
oligonucleotides corresponding to a consensus sequence of the spacer
region of ZNF91 family members, Bellefroid et al. (1993) identified 23
distinct ZNF91-related genes, including ZNF107. They demonstrated that
members of the ZNF91 family are widely expressed in human tissues, with
the highest expression in T-lymphoid cells.

By sequence analysis of a human aorta-specific cDNA, followed by 5-prime
RACE of human brain cDNA, Li et al. (1999) cloned ZNF107, which they
called ZFD25. The deduced 783-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 90.67 kD and contains 25 C2H2-type zinc fingers.
ZNF107 shares 70% homology with both ZNF91 and ZNF117 (194624). The
5-prime untranslated region contains a KRAB domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 6.2-kb transcript in human brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and pancreas. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in
human aorta, liver, lung, and cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells,
umbilical artery smooth muscle cells, and HepG2 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1999) showed that ZNF107 expression in cultured human
umbilical vein endothelial cells decreased in response to a shift from
20% fetal calf serum to serum-free media. They suggested that ZNF107 may
play a role in serum-dependent cellular processes, such as cell
proliferation and survival.

MAPPING

By FISH, Bellefroid et al. (1993) mapped a YAC clone containing the
ZNF107 gene to 7q11.2.

;;FLJ14957;;
KIAA1749
CGNL1/CYP19A1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned a partial CGNL1 cDNA, which they
designated KIAA1749. RT-PCR followed by ELISA detected high expression
in smooth muscle, spleen, testis, fetal brain, and the amygdala, corpus
callosum, cerebellum, thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus of adult brain.

MAPPING

In a study of cases of estrogen excess due to increased expression of
the aromatase gene (CYP19A1; 107910), Shozu et al. (2003) mapped 3
closely situated genes in 15q21.2-q21.3 in the following order from
telomere to centromere: CGNL1, which they called FLJ14957, TMOD3
(605112), and aromatase (CYP19A1; 107910). By genome database analysis,
Shozu et al. (2003) found that CGNL1 and TMOD3 are transcribed from the
same DNA strand toward the telomere, whereas the aromatase gene is
transcribed from the opposite strand toward the centromere.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shozu et al. (2003) determined that the regulatory regions upstream of
the CGNL1 and TMOD3 promoters are similar. Each has typical
characteristics of a TATA-less promoter, which includes a transcription
initiator cap sequence and multiple DNA motifs that bind transcription
factors.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a father and son with severe gynecomastia of prepubertal onset
(139300) and mild hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, Shozu et al. (2003)
found that an inversion in the 15q21.2-q21.3 region brought the CGNL1
promoter into a position close to the CYP19A1 coding region, resulting
in a cryptic aromatase promoter containing a portion of the CGNL1
promoter and causing a syndrome of estrogen excess (see 107910.0010).

116951	TITLE *116951 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 11A; CDK11A
;;CELL DIVISION CYCLE 2-LIKE 2; CDC2L2;;
PITSLRE A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While characterizing the structure of the CDC2L1 (CDK11B; 176873)
candidate tumor suppressor gene located on 1p36, Lahti et al. (1994)
identified a highly related gene within a contiguous 100-kb genomic
region. They referred to CDC2L1 as PITSLRE B, following the convention
of naming CDC2-related kinases by the amino acid sequence of the region
corresponding to the conserved CDC2 PSTAIRE box. The related gene was
designated PITSLRE A, or CDC2L2.

Xiang et al. (1994) isolated multiple, alternatively spliced CDC2L2
mRNAs. The CDC2L2 transcripts encode 5 protein isoforms ranging in size
from 65 to 110 kD. The isoforms vary in the length and sequence of their
N-terminal regions; the protein kinase catalytic and C-terminal domains
are identical. All contain a 30-residue acid blob domain comprised
primarily of glutamic acid. The mRNAs encoding the 3 largest isoforms,
CDC2L2 alpha-2-1, -2-2, and -2-3, contain 2 alternative translation
initiation sites separated by 58 amino acids. In vitro translation of
these mRNAs yields the 90- and 110-kD isoforms observed in extracts of
HeLa cells. Subcellular fractionation studies indicated that the 110-kD
isoforms are primarily localized in the nucleus. The 65-kD isoform was
detected only in cells undergoing apoptosis. Using Northern blot
analysis, Xiang et al. (1994) found that the alpha-2 isoforms are
encoded by 3.5- and 3.7-kb mRNAs that are expressed in most human cell
lines and tissues. The mRNA encoding the 65-kD CDC2L2 alpha-1 isoform
had a more restricted expression pattern. The authors also detected an
antisense transcript corresponding to the 5-prime untranslated region of
the alpha-1 mRNA. The antisense and sense transcripts shared the same
expression pattern.

The CDC2L1 and CDC2L2 genes encode almost identical protein kinases of
110 kD that contain at their C termini the open reading frame of a
smaller isoform of 58 kD. Cornelis et al. (2000) found that 2 PITSLRE
protein kinase isoforms, p110 and p58, are translated from a single
transcript by initiation at alternative in-frame AUG codons. p110 is
produced by classic cap-dependent translation, whereas p58 results from
internal initiation of translation controlled by an internal ribosome
entry site (IRES) with unique properties. The IRES element is localized
to the mRNA coding region, and its activity is cell cycle regulated,
permitting translation of p58 in G2/M.

Loyer et al. (2008) stated that both CDC2L2 and CDC2L1 can produce a
third isoform, p46, by caspase-dependent proteolysis of either the p110
or p58 isoforms. By immunofluorescence analysis of several human cell
lines, they detected p110 in both nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles.
Western blot analysis showed robust expression of p110 in several human
cell lines and in activated human peripheral blood cells. Only activated
blood cells expressed p58 and p46. Size exclusion chromatography of HeLa
cells revealed that p110 fractionated with protein complexes of about
170 kD to over 1 MDa.

GENE FUNCTION

Advanced-stage neuroblastoma (256700) and tumor-derived cell lines
consistently contain a deletion of 1 allele of the distal short arm of
chromosome 1. The deletion correlates with enhanced metastatic
potential, suggesting that inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene or
genes on 1p may contribute to the pathogenesis of these tumors. Lahti et
al. (1994) demonstrated that 1 allele of the entire CDC2L gene complex
was either deleted or translocated in 18 of 20 neuroblastoma cell lines
investigated. They suggested that the CDC2L gene complex may harbor 1 or
more tumor suppressor genes affected by chromosome 1p36 modifications in
neuroblastoma.

By immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays with human
cell lines, Loyer et al. (2008) found that p110 CDK11 associated with
the alpha and beta isoforms of cyclin L1 (CCNL1; 613384) and L2 (CCNL2;
613482) in a high molecular mass complex that showed splicing activity.
The p58 and p46 CDK11 isoforms interacted more weakly with the cyclin L
alpha isoforms. In vivo splicing assays showed that expression of cyclin
L1-alpha, L1-beta, L2-alpha, or L2-beta and/or p110 CDK11 increased
intron-splicing activity and altered alternative splice-site selection
in a cyclin L1 and L2 isoform- and cell type-specific manner. In
contrast with p110 CDK11, p58 and p46 CDK11 reduced splicing activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gururajan et al. (1998) determined the structure of the 140-kb CDC2L
genomic region. This region consists of 2 identical genomic segments
arranged in a tail-to-tail configuration. Each segment contains a CDC2L
gene linked to an MMP gene. See MMP21 (603320). In each case, the most
widely expressed products of the CDC2L gene are derived from a genomic
region that is composed of 20 exons and spans approximately 20 kb. The
authors reported that only 15 amino acids of the 773-786 residues that
encode the multiple CDC2L isoforms are unique to either CDC2L1 or
CDC2L2.

Feng et al. (2004) found that the promoter region of the CDK11A gene is
CG rich and does not contain TATA and CAAT boxes. They identified 2 ETS1
(164720)-binding sites, a cAMP-responsive element (see CREB1; 123810),
and a TCF11 (NFE2L1; 163260)-binding site. Feng et al. (2004) confirmed
binding of ETS1 and CREB1 to the CDK11A promoter region in vitro and in
vivo.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lahti et al. (1994) mapped the
CDC2L2 gene to 1p36.3.

HISTORY

Protein kinase p58 (CDC2L1; 176873) is a human cell division control
(CDC)-related molecule that is structurally and functionally related to
p34 (CDC2; 116940). Whereas the p58 gene is located on 1p36, Eipers et
al. (1991) found by mouse-human somatic cell hybrid studies that a
highly related p58 sequence maps to chromosome 15. Subsequently, the
CDC2L2 gene on chromosome 15 was retired by the HUGO Nomenclature
Committee. The designation CDC2L2 represents a gene on 1p36.

Although Lahti et al. (1994) reported that a third gene, PITSLRE C, was
also present in the region of 1p36 containing the PITSLRE A and PITSLRE
B genes, Gururajan et al. (1998) found that PITSLRE C does not exist.

603698	TITLE *603698 GOLGI-SPECIFIC BREFELDIN-A RESISTANCE FACTOR 1; GBF1
DESCRIPTION Members of the Sec7 domain family share a conserved region that forms a
catalytic fold with guanine nucleotide exchange activity. In vitro, the
Sec7 domain of several proteins catalyzes the activation of
ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs; see 103180), suggesting that members of
the Sec7 domain family represent specific guanine nucleotide exchange
factors for the ARF GTPase family. Nagase et al. (1996) isolated
KIAA0248, a partial cDNA from immature myeloid cells encoding a protein
with homology to S. cerevisiae Sec7. Using 5-prime RACE, Mansour et al.
(1998) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the remainder of the coding
sequence. They designated the gene GBF1 (Golgi-specific brefeldin A
resistance factor-1). The predicted 1,859-amino acid protein has a pI of
5.55 and contains a Sec7 domain and a proline-rich C terminus. A 7-kb
GBF1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested by Northern blot analysis.

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Mansour et al. (1998) mapped the GBF1 gene to 10q24.
Another Sec7 domain family member, PSD (602327), maps to the same
region.

612234	TITLE *612234 CALCIUM HOMEOSTASIS MODULATOR 1; CALHM1
;;FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 26, MEMBER C; FAM26C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CALHM1 is a cerebral Ca(2+) channel that controls processing of
amyloid-beta (A-beta) precursor protein (APP; 104760)
(Dreses-Werringloer et al., 2008).

CLONING

Using a bioinformatic strategy to screen for hippocampus-expressed genes
located in Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) linkage regions,
Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) identified CALHM1, which maps to the
AD6 region (605526) on chromosome 10. The deduced 346-amino acid CALHM1
protein contains a hydrophobic loop that does not cross the membrane, 3
transmembrane segments, and 2 putative N-glycosylation sites. RT-PCR
detected highest CALHM1 expression in whole adult brain, spinal cord,
and all adult brain regions examined, with much lower expression in all
other tissues examined, including fetal brain. Immunohistochemical
analysis revealed that CALHM1 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and plasma membrane in transfected cells. Western blot analysis of
transfected cells showed 2 CALHM1 bands around 40 kD, and glycosidase
treatment revealed that the upper band represented the fully
glycosylated form. Mutation analysis showed that asn140 was the
glycosylated residue, and it was predicted to be oriented on the luminal
side when CALHM1 is in the ER membrane and in the extracellular space
when CALHM1 reaches the plasma membrane. In the absence of reducing
agents, CALHM1 proteins appeared to migrate as dimers and tetramers, and
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that CALHM1 homomultimerized to form
dimers and possibly tetramers. Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008)
identified CALHM1 orthologs in all 20 species examined, including mouse
and C. elegans.

GENE FUNCTION

Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) found that CALHM1 had properties of an
ion channel and controlled cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations following
expression in mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes. AD is characterized
by the presence of cerebral senile plaques composed of aggregated A-beta
peptides generated by proteolysis of APP. Dreses-Werringloer et al.
(2008) found that CALHM1 decreased total extracellular accumulation of
A-beta peptides, including the pathogenic peptides A-beta-40 and
A-beta-42, in APP-expressing mouse neuroblastoma cells that had been
exposed to Ca(2+) depletion followed by Ca(2+) add back. Inhibition of
endogenous CALHM1 expression by RNA interference led to significantly
increased A-beta levels in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells
after Ca(2+) add back. Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) concluded that
CALHM1 controls APP proteolysis in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner.

Taruno et al. (2013) demonstrated that CALHM1, a voltage-gated ion
channel, is indispensable for taste stimuli-evoked ATP release from
sweet-, bitter-, and umami-sensing taste bud cells. Calhm1 knockout mice
have severely impaired perceptions of sweet, bitter, and umami
compounds, whereas their recognition of sour and salty tastes remains
mostly normal. Calhm1 deficiency affects taste perception without
interfering with taste cell development or integrity. CALHM1 is
expressed specifically in sweet/bitter/umami-sensing type II taste buds.
Its heterologous expression induces a novel ATP permeability that
releases ATP from cells in response to manipulations that activate the
CALHM1 ion channel. Knockout of Calhm1 strongly reduces voltage-gated
currents in type II cells and taste-evoked ATP release from taste buds
without affecting the excitability of taste cells by taste stimuli.
Thus, Taruno et al. (2013) concluded that CALHM1 is a voltage-gated
ATP-release channel required for sweet, bitter, and umami taste
perception.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) mapped
the CALHM1 gene to chromosome 10q24.33.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) identified the CALHM1 gene within the
AD6 (605526) region on chromosome 10q24. They identified a 394C-T SNP
(dbSNP rs2986017) in the CALHM1 gene, resulting in a pro86-to-leu (P86L)
substitution. In 5 independent case-control populations including a
total of 2,043 patients with late-onset AD and 1,361 controls, the
authors observed an association between the T allele of this SNP and
disease (odds ratio of 1.44, p = 2 x 10(-10)). In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the polymorphic P86L channel exhibited
decreased CALHM1-induced calcium permeability, resulting in decreased
cytosolic calcium levels, as well as impaired ability to inhibit
generation of insoluble beta-amyloid. The findings indicated a role for
calcium signaling in APP processing and suggested that variations in the
CALHM1 gene may influence susceptibility to late-onset AD.

Beecham et al. (2009) were unable to replicate the findings of
Dreses-Werringloer et al. (2008) in a case-control study of 510 patients
with late-onset AD and 524 controls. Beecham et al. (2009) found no
association with dbSNP rs2986017 despite adequate power.

614612	TITLE *614612 KN MOTIF- AND ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; KANK4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the KANK family, such as KANK4, contain a KANK N-terminal
(KN) motif, at least 1 coiled-coil domain, and an ankyrin (see 612641)
repeat domain. KANK proteins appear to regulate formation of actin
stress fibers (Zhu et al., 2008).

CLONING

By database analysis, Zhu et al. (2008) identified human KANK2 (614610),
KANK3 (614611), and KANK4. They identified orthologs of all 3 KANK genes
in rat and mouse and at least 1 KANK ortholog in chicken, fish, sea
urchin, fly, and nematode. The deduced 995-amino acid human KANK4
protein contains a KN motif, followed by a coiled-coil motif and 5
C-terminal ankyrin repeats. The KN motif contains leucine- and
arginine-rich regions and potential nuclear localization and export
signals. RT-PCR detected KANK4 expression in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in colon, kidney, liver, lung, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu et al. (2008) found that overexpression of human KANK2, KANK3, or
KANK4 in mouse fibroblasts reduced formation of actin stress fibers.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the KANK4 gene to chromosome 1p31.3 based on an
alignment of the KANK4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC041418) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608842	TITLE *608842 COILED-COIL-HELIX-COILED-COIL-HELIX DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; CHCHD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a placental bed cDNA library enriched for first-trimester
extravillous trophoblasts to identify genes specific to early placenta
development, Westerman et al. (2004) cloned CHCHD1, which they
designated C2360. CHCHD1 contains a central
coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain. Each helix contains 2
cysteines separated by 9 amino acids. Human and mouse CHCHD1 share 85%
amino acid identity in the conserved domain. RT-PCR detected strongest
expression in first-trimester placental bed and in a choriocarcinoma
cell line. Weak expression was detected in developing tissues, such as
embryonic brain, chorionic villus fibroblasts, and full-term placenta.
No expression was detected in adult tissues. In situ hybridization
showed that expression in the first-trimester placental bed was
restricted to proliferative cytotrophoblasts at the proximal zone of
placental anchoring villi. Transfected choriocarcinoma cells expressed
fluorescence-labeled CHCHD1 in the nucleus, and mutation analysis
indicated that the nuclear localization domain is in the N terminus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Westerman et al. (2004) determined that the CHCHD1 gene contains 3
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Westerman et al. (2004) mapped the CHCHD1
gene to chromosome 10q22.

605660	TITLE *605660 PREFOLDIN 6; PFDN6
;;KE2, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; HKE2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PFDN6 is a subunit of the heteromeric prefoldin complex that chaperones
nascent actin (see 102560) and alpha- and beta-tubulin (see 602529 and
191130, respectively) chains pending their transfer to the cytosolic
chaperonin containing TCP1 (186980) (CCT) complex (Hansen et al., 1999).

CLONING

A number of diseases are influenced by genes at the centromeric end of
the major histocompatibility complex (see 142800) on chromosome 6p21.3.
Herberg et al. (1998) cloned and characterized genes, including HKE2, in
the 70-kb, gene-dense segment flanking the tapasin (TAPBP; 601962) gene.
The 129-amino acid HKE2 protein is identical to the mouse Ke2 sequence
apart from the insertion of 2 residues at position 122.

Vainberg et al. (1998) purified the prefoldin heterohexameric chaperone
from bovine testis and, by database analysis, they identified Pfdn6 in
several species, including mouse. The deduced mouse protein contains 127
amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a mouse antibody directed against PFDN6 to follow the prefoldin
complex, Hansen et al. (1999) showed that prefoldin is involved in
chaperoning nascent chains of the cytoskeletal proteins actin,
alpha-tubulin, and beta-tubulin in HeLa cells and rabbit reticulocyte
lysates. Prefoldin bound to actin chains after synthesis of the
N-terminal 130 to 140 amino acids and to beta-tubulin after synthesis of
about 250 amino acids. Prefoldin remained bound to the relatively
unfolded actin and tubulin polypeptides until delivery of the
full-length proteins to CCT for folding to their native states.

GENE STRUCTURE

Herberg et al. (1998) determined that the PFDN6 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Herberg et al. (1998) mapped the PFDN6
gene to chromosome 6p21.3.

610058	TITLE *610058 TUBULIN-SPECIFIC CHAPERONE A; TBCA
;;CHAPERONIN COFACTOR A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Microtubules are polymers of alpha-tubulin (see TUBA1; 191110) and
beta-tubulin (see TUBB; 191130) that participate in essential cell
functions. A multistep process involving molecular chaperones and
cofactors, including TBCA, produces tubulin heterodimers competent to
polymerize. TBCA specifically interacts with a folding intermediate of
beta-tubulin and acts as a molecular chaperone (Nolasco et al., 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs obtained from umbilical cord blood CD34
(142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, Mao et al. (1998)
identified TBCA.

GENE FUNCTION

Tian et al. (1996) found that purified bovine cofactor A formed a stable
complex with beta-tubulin intermediates generated by ATP-dependent
action of the cytosolic chaperonin complex. Through this interaction,
cofactor A appeared to increase the rate of tubulin cycling and,
secondarily, to stimulate the ATPase activity of the complex.

Using small interfering RNA to silence TBCA expression in HeLa and MCF7
mammary carcinoma cell lines, Nolasco et al. (2005) found that TBCA was
essential for cell viability. TBCA knockdown produced a decrease in the
amount of soluble tubulin, modifications in microtubules, and G1 cell
cycle arrest. In MCF7 cells, cell death was preceded by a change in cell
shape resembling differentiation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid mapping Consortium mapped the TBCA
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP SHGC-34767).

605255	TITLE *605255 ETS VARIANT GENE 7; ETV7
;;ETS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TEL2; TEL2;;
TELB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family of transcription factors,
of which ETV7 is a member, is a large group of evolutionarily conserved
transcriptional regulators that play an important role in a variety of
cellular processes throughout development and differentiation, and are
involved in oncogenesis as well (Potter et al., 2000).

CLONING

Potter et al. (2000) sequenced cDNA clones corresponding to a novel ETS
gene from an activated T-cell cDNA library, as well as from breast
tissue and meningioma cDNA libraries. The cDNA, which the authors
designated TEL2, encodes a deduced 341-amino acid protein that shares
38% sequence identity with TEL1 (ETV6; 600618). TEL2 contains a
C-terminal ETS domain and an N-terminal PNT domain, which is thought to
mediate protein-protein interactions. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of TEL2 mRNA predominantly in hematopoietic tissues; a
predominant band of approximately 1.2 kb was present in fetal liver and
bone marrow and was faintly present in peripheral blood leukocytes.
Using antibodies raised against the C terminus of the TEL2 protein,
Potter et al. (2000) showed that TEL2 localizes to the nucleus. The
striking similarities of TEL2 to TEL1, its expression in hematopoietic
tissues, and its ability to associate with TEL1 suggested that TEL2 may
be an important hematopoietic regulatory protein.

Poirel et al. (2000) identified the TELB gene by comparison of the TEL
sequence with genomic sequence databases. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of TELB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Potter et al. (2000) determined that the TEL2 gene contains 8 exons
spanning approximately 21 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by inclusion within a PAC
clone, Potter et al. (2000) mapped the TEL2 gene to chromosome 6p21.

Poirel et al. (2000) mapped the TELB gene to 6p21 by genomic sequence
analysis.

192225	TITLE *192225 VASCULAR CELL ADHESION MOLECULE 1; VCAM1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed
by cytokine-activated endothelium, mediates the adhesion of monocytes
and lymphocytes (Cybulsky et al., 1991). In inflammatory conditions and
in cardiac allografts undergoing rejection, VCAM1 is upregulated in
endothelium of postcapillary venules. Arterial expression of VCAM1 is
also found in experimental models of atherosclerosis in the rabbit.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cybulsky et al. (1991) demonstrated that VCAM1 is present in single copy
in the human genome and contains 9 exons spanning about 25 kb of DNA. At
least 2 different VCAM1 precursors can be generated from the human gene
as a result of alternative mRNA splicing events, which include or
exclude exon 5.

MAPPING

Cybulsky et al. (1991) mapped the VCAM1 gene to chromosome 1 by Southern
analysis of somatic cell hybrids. A study of 2 hybrid lines carrying
translocations involving chromosome 1 permitted regionalization to
1p34-p21. Fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes
further narrowed the localization to 1p32-p31. (Another endothelial
leukocyte adhesion molecule, ELAM1 (131210), is located on chromosome 1,
but on the long arm.)

Kumar et al. (1994) mapped the murine Vcam1 gene to chromosome 3 near
Amy1.

GENE FUNCTION

In a review of molecular pathways controlling heart development, Olson
and Srivastava (1996) cited studies indicating that deficiencies of the
cell adhesion molecules VCAM and alpha-4 integrin (192975) result in
epicardial dissolution and subsequent myocardial thinning.

Lu and Cyster (2002) studied the mechanisms that control localization of
marginal zone B cells. They demonstrated that marginal zone B cells
express elevated levels of the integrins LFA1 (see 153370/600065) and
alpha-4 (192975)-beta-1 (135630), and that the marginal zone B cells
bind to the ligands ICAM1 (147840) and VCAM1. These ligands are
expressed within the marginal zone in a lymphotoxin-dependent manner.
Combined inhibition of LFA1 and alpha-4-beta-1 causes a rapid and
selective release of B cells from the marginal zone. Furthermore,
lipopolysaccharide-triggered marginal zone B cell relocalization
involves downregulation of integrin-mediated adhesion. Lu and Cyster
(2002) concluded that their studies identified key requirements for
marginal zone B cell localization and established a role for integrins
in peripheral lymphoid tissue compartmentalization.

Garmy-Susini et al. (2005) demonstrated that integrin alpha-4-beta-1 and
VCAM1 are expressed by proliferating but not quiescent endothelial cells
and mural cells, respectively. Antagonists of this integrin-ligand pair
blocked the adhesion of mural cells to proliferating endothelia in vitro
and in vivo, thereby inducing apoptosis of endothelial cells and
pericytes and inhibiting neovascularization. Garmy-Susini et al. (2005)
concluded that integrin alpha-4-beta-1 and VCAM1 facilitate a critical
cell-cell adhesion event required for survival of endothelial and mural
cells during vascularization.

Garrison et al. (2005) described cotransin, a small molecule that
inhibits protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. Cotransin
acts in a signal-sequence-discriminatory manner to prevent the stable
insertion of select nascent chains (specifically VCAM1, and P-selectin,
173610) into the Sec61 translocation channel. Garrison et al. (2005)
concluded that the range of substrates accommodated by the channel can
be specifically and reversibly modulated by a cell-permeable small
molecule that alters the interaction between signal sequences and the
Sec61 complex. This has various implications for drug development.

Besemer et al. (2005) developed a very similar VCAM1 depressing agent,
which they called CAM741. CAM741 works similar to cotransin in that it
represses the biosynthesis of VCAM1 cells by blocking the process of
cotranslational translocation, which is dependent on the signal peptide
of VCAM1. CAM741 does not inhibit targeting of the VCAM1 nascent chains
to the translocon channel but prevents translocation to the luminal side
of the endoplasmic reticulum through a process that involves the
translocon component Sec61-beta (609214). Consequently, the VCAM1
precursor protein is synthesized towards the cytosolic compartment of
the cells, where it is degraded.

By in vivo selection, transcriptomic analysis, functional verification,
and clinical validation, Minn et al. (2005) identified a set of genes
that marks and mediates breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Some of
these genes serve dual functions, providing growth advantages both in
the primary tumor and in the lung microenvironment. Others contribute to
aggressive growth selectivity in the lung. Among the lung metastasis
signature genes identified, several, including VCAM1, were functionally
validated. Those subjects expressing the lung metastasis signature had a
significantly poorer lung metastasis-free survival, but not bone
metastasis-free survival, compared to subjects without the signature.

Campbell et al. (2006) found that increased serum levels of soluble
VCAM1 predicted recurrent ischemic stroke (601367) in a study of 252
patients. A smaller but similar trend was noted for serum levels of
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NPPB; 600295). Patients in
the highest quarters for both sVCAM1 and NT-proBNP levels had 3.6 times
the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke compared to patients in the lowest
quarters for both biologic markers.

By database analysis, Harris et al. (2008) identified a potential target
sequence for miR126 (MIRN126; 611767), a microRNA selectively expressed
in endothelial cells, in the 3-prime UTR of VCAM1. Transfection of human
endothelial cells with antisense miR126 permitted an increase in
TNF-alpha (TNF; 191160)-stimulated VCAM1 expression. Conversely,
overexpression of the miR126 precursor increased miR126 levels and
decreased VCAM1 expression. Decreasing endogenous miR126 levels
increased leukocyte adherence to endothelial cells. Harris et al. (2008)
concluded that miR126 inhibits VCAM1 expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Taylor et al. (2002) identified 33 SNPs in the VCAM1 locus. They then
analyzed a subset of these SNPs in 51 cases of stroke in sickle cell
disease (603903) patients derived from a single institution in Jamaica
and in 51 matched controls. They found that the C variant allele of the
nonsynonymous SNP 1238G-C, which results in a gly413-to-ala amino acid
change (G413A), may be associated with protection from stroke (odds
ratio = 0.35). Dover (2002) stated that sickle cell disease is not a
single gene disorder and emphasized the need for further studies of the
relationship of VCAM1 to strokes in this disorder.

Idelman et al. (2007) stated that VCAM1 transcription induction is
highly dependent on cell and organ type and mode of stimulation by
various transcription factors. The authors identified 8 VCAM1 promoter
haplotypes comprising 13 SNPs previously identified by Taylor et al.
(2002) in African Americans. Functional cellular expression studies in T
cells stimulated by T-cell mitogens assessed the inducibility of
expression of the different haplotypes. A -540A-G SNP (dbSNP rs3783605)
was found to gain an ETS2 (164740)-binding site, which was postulated by
Idelman et al. (2007) to have functional importance.

603515	TITLE *603515 CHORIONIC SOMATOMAMMOTROPIN HORMONE-LIKE 1; CSHL1
;;CHORIONIC SOMATOMAMMOTROPIN-LIKE; CSL
DESCRIPTION The human growth hormone/human chorionic somatomammotropin (GH/CS) gene
cluster contains 5 genes, including chorionic somatomammotropin-like
(CSL). See CSH1 (CSA; 150200).

Chen et al. (1989) recovered CSL cDNAs from a placenta library. They
noted that CSL cDNAs were present at a relatively low level in the
library compared to CSA and CSB (118820) cDNAs. The CSL gene has a
single nucleotide substitution (relative to the other 4 genes in the
cluster) in a splice donor site that results in a different mRNA
splicing pattern and, hence, in a novel sequence of the predicted CSL
protein. Chen et al. (1989) proposed that the CSL protein may be
evolving into a distinct hormone. Using RT-PCR, MacLeod et al. (1992)
found 2 alternatively spliced CSL transcripts in the placental villi.
However, they found no evidence that either of these transcripts is
translated or functional.

Misra-Press et al. (1994) found that CSL is actively transcribed in the
placenta and exhibits a complex pattern of alternative splicing. The
majority of the CSL transcripts encode predicted nonfunctional proteins.
However, a subpopulation of mRNAs retain the potential for synthesis of
a functional, secreted, gestational hormone. These authors noted that
Goossens et al. (1986) (see 139250) and Wurzel et al. (1982) (see CSA)
described normally developed infants who lacked the other 3 placentally
expressed genes of the GH/CS cluster but who had an intact CSL gene.
Misra-Press et al. (1994) stated that these studies suggest that CSL
might compensate for absence of the other members of the GH/CS cluster
during human gestation.

By in situ hybridization, Harper et al. (1982) mapped the GH gene
cluster to 17q22-q24.

125255	TITLE *125255 DECORIN; DCN
;;PROTEOGLYCAN II;;
PG II;;
PG40
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Decorin and biglycan (301870) are related but distinct small
proteoglycans found in many connective tissues. Using Northern blot
analysis or RT-PCR, Danielson et al. (1993) detected the 2 alternatively
spliced leader exons of the DCN gene in a variety of mRNAs isolated from
human cell lines and tissues. Sequences highly homologous (74-87%) to
exons Ia and Ib were found in the 5-prime untranslated region of avian
and bovine decorin, respectively. This high degree of conservation among
species suggested regulatory functions for these leader exons. In situ
hybridization studies of developing mouse embryos suggested that decorin
may play a role in epithelial/mesenchymal interactions during organ
development and shaping (Scholzen et al., 1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

Danielson et al. (1993) found that the human decorin gene spans more
than 38 kb and contains 8 exons and very large introns, 2 of which are
5.4 and more than 13.2 kb. They discovered 2 alternatively spliced
leader exons, Ia and Ib, in the 5-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs
with cDNA probes, McBride et al. (1990) assigned the DCN gene to
chromosome 12. Regionalization to 12p12.1-qter was obtained by examining
hybrids containing spontaneous breaks or well-characterized
translocations involving chromosome 12. Hybridization with subfragment
cDNA probes suggested the presence of 2 copies of the DCN gene, or
related sequences, at the locus on chromosome 12, although there was no
evidence for the function of more than one DCN gene. By in situ
hybridization, Pulkkinen et al. (1992) placed the DCN gene at 12q21-q22.
Vetter et al., (1993) mapped the human decorin gene by in situ
hybridization to 12q21.3. Using a genomic clone as the labeled probe and
in situ hybridization, Danielson et al. (1993) mapped the DCN gene to
12q23. They specifically noted that there were 4 times as many grains
centered on 12q23 as on 12q21, where Pulkkinen et al. (1992) had placed
the probable site. In a study of candidate genes for Noonan syndrome
(163950), Ion et al. (2000) reassigned the map position of DCN to
12q13.2 using FISH. Scholzen et al. (1994) assigned the homologous gene
in the mouse to chromosome 10, using interspecific backcrossing.

GENE FUNCTION

Vogel and Clark (1989) found little evidence that the metabolism of
either decorin or biglycan is altered by abnormalities in the structure
or secretion of types I and III collagen. In a presumably homozygous
case of the Marfan syndrome (154700) reported by Schollin et al. (1988),
Pulkkinen et al. (1990) found markedly decreased level of mRNA for
decorin, markedly decreased decorin polypeptide in the culture medium of
fibroblasts from the infant, and deficient effect of interleukin-1-beta
(147720) on the transcription of decorin as tested in these fibroblasts.
In 3 of 12 other unrelated Marfan patients, they also found deficient
decorin expression.

Dyne et al. (1996) studied 2 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and
the same gly415-to-ser mutation of the COL1A1 gene (120150.0044), but a
different clinical expression. They speculated that these differences
could be the result of abnormalities in other connective tissue
proteins. Since decorin is a component of connective tissue, binds to
type I collagen fibrils, and plays a role in matrix assembly, they
studied decorin production in skin fibroblasts from these 2 patients.
Cultured fibroblasts from the patient with extremely severe osteogenesis
imperfecta (classified as type II/III) were found to secrete barely
detectable amounts of decorin into culture medium. Northern blot
analysis showed decorin mRNA levels below the limit of detection. The
patient with a less severe phenotype had fibroblasts that expressed
decorin normally. Dyne et al. (1996) suggested that the different
clinical phenotypes could be due to the differing genetic backgrounds of
the patients, such that in the more severely affected patient the
absence of decorin aggravated the clinical phenotype.

When expressed ectopically, decorin is capable of suppressing the growth
of various tumor cell lines. Moscatello et al. (1998) demonstrated that
it induced a marked growth suppression in A431 squamous carcinoma cells,
when either exogenously added or endogenously produced by a transgene.
Decorin caused rapid phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (131550) and a
concurrent activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signal
pathway. Thus, EGF and decorin converge functionally to regulate the
cell cycle through activation of a common pathway that ultimately leads
to growth suppression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family with congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD; 610048),
Bredrup et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion in the
last exon, which they erroneously labeled exon 10 (Rodahl, 2009), of the
DCN gene (125255.0001). The deletion was found in all affected family
members but not in any healthy family member or in 200 normal controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CORNEAL DYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL STROMAL
DCN, 1-BP DEL, 967T

In a Norwegian family originally reported by Odland (1968) with
congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD; 610048), Bredrup et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (967delT) in the last
exon, which they erroneously labeled exon 10 (Rodahl, 2009), of the DCN
gene. The mutation was predicted to lead to a frameshift, alteration of
4 amino acids, and loss of the C-terminal 33 amino acids (S323fsX5).
Bredrup et al. (2005) postulated that the defective interaction of
mutant decorin with collagen would disturb the regularity of corneal
collagen in affected heterozygotes.

;;THIOREDOXIN-LIKE PROTEIN p19; TLP19;;
ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM PROTEIN, 18-KD; ERP18;;
ANTERIOR GRADIENT 1, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF; AGR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TXNDC12 belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily (see TXN; 187700).
Members of this superfamily possess a thioredoxin fold with a consensus
active-site sequence (CxxC) and have roles in redox regulation, defense
against oxidative stress, refolding of disulfide-containing proteins,
and regulation of transcription factors (Liu et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching genomic and EST databases for putative secretory proteins,
followed by RT-PCR of human liver RNA, Liu et al. (2003) cloned TXNDC12,
which they called TLP19. The transcript contains 2 putative poly(A)
signals in its 3-prime UTR. The deduced 172-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 19.2 kD. TLP19 has an N-terminal signal
peptide and a central thioredoxin-like domain containing the consensus
active-site motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb TLP19
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in placenta
and liver. Placenta also expressed a 1.2-kb TLP19 transcript.
Epitope-tagged TLP19 was expressed in the Golgi apparatus of transiently
transfected COS-7 cells, and it was secreted into the culture medium.

Alanen et al. (2003) cloned TXNDC12, which they called ERP18, from a
liver cDNA library. They identified a putative C-terminal endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) retention signal (EDEL) within the deduced protein.
Alanen et al. (2003) also noted that the active-site motif of ERP18
(CGAC) is unlike the catalytic motifs of other thioredoxin superfamily
members, including thioredoxins, isomerases, and oxidating enzymes. The
overall structure of the ERP18 catalytic domain most strongly resembles
those of protein disulfide isomerases (PDI; see 176790). In contrast to
the findings of Liu et al. (2003), Alanen et al. (2003) found that
fluorescence-tagged ERP18 was retained in the ER of transfected COS-7
cells, and the staining did not overlap that of a Golgi marker.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

From circular dichroism and NMR measurements, Alanen et al. (2003)
determined that ERP18 undergoes only a minor conformational change upon
dithiol-disulfide exchange in the active site. Guanidinium chloride
denaturation curves indicated that the reduced form of the protein is
more stable than the oxidized form, suggesting that ERP18 is involved in
disulfide bond formation.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2003) found that recombinant TLP19 without the signal
peptide showed reducing activity against an insulin-disulfide substrate.

Alanen et al. (2003) found that ERP18 showed significant peptide
thiol-disulfide oxidase activity in vitro, and the activity was
dependent on the presence of both active-site cysteines. The activity
differed from that of the human PDI family in that it was limited by
substrate oxidation and not by enzyme reoxidation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (2003) determined that the TLP19 gene contains 7 exons and
spans more than 35 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2003) mapped the TLP19 gene to
chromosome 1p32.3.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nucleoside monophosphate kinases, including adenylate kinases, catalyze
the reversible phosphorylation between nucleoside triphosphates and
monophosphates.

CLONING

Bruns and Regina (1977) analyzed the subcellular compartmentalization of
adenylate kinase-2 (EC 2.7.4.3) in HeLa cells, mouse RAG cells, and
RAG-human hybrids expressing human AK2. The results indicated that AK2
is a mitochondrial enzyme.

Noma et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding human adenylate kinase-2 from
a HeLa cell cDNA library, using bovine AK2 cDNA as probe. Two
transcripts were identified: one, designated AK2A, encodes a deduced
239-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 26.5 kD, and
the other, designated AK2B, encodes a deduced 232-amino acid protein
with a predicted molecular mass of 25.6 kD. Northern blot analysis
demonstrated 3 strong hybridizing signals of 0.9 (AK2A), 1.7 (AK2B), and
3.5 kb, with high expression in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and
pancreas, moderate expression in kidney, placenta, and brain, and weak
expression in lung. However, Western blot analysis showed high levels of
AK2 protein in liver, heart, and kidney, low levels in lung, and
undetectable levels in brain and skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

The existence of a second adenylate kinase locus linked to PGM1 and
peptidase C, i.e., on chromosome 1, was suggested by cell hybridization
studies by Van Cong et al. (1972). The Goss-Harris method of mapping
combines features of recombinational study in families and synteny tests
in hybrid cells. As applied to chromosome 1, the method shows that AK2
and UMPK are distal to PGM1 and that the order of the loci is PGM1:
UMPK: (AK2, alpha-FUC): ENO1 (Goss and Harris, 1977). Carritt et al.
(1982) presented evidence that AK2 is in 1p34.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2007) showed that intrinsic apoptosis in human cells that
was induced by the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide or the antibiotic
staurosporine, but not by FAS ligand (TNFSF6; 134638) or TRAIL (TNFSF10;
603598), caused translocation of AK2 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm,
followed by formation of a complex between AK2, FADD (602457), and
CASP10 (601762). Yeast 2-hybrid analysis, protein pull-down assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the N- and C-terminal domains
of AK2, which include nucleoside- and substrate-binding domains,
respectively, bound the C-terminal death domain of FADD. AK2 binding
promoted association of CASP10 with FADD, and addition of purified AK2
protein to cell extracts induced activation of CASP10 via FADD, leading
to subsequent activation of CASP9 (602234) and CASP3 (600636). Apoptosis
through the AK2 complex did not correlate with the adenylate kinase
activity of AK2, did not require CASP8 (601763)-mediated apoptotic
responses, and did not involve mitochondrial cytochrome c release.
Immunodepletion or knockdown of AK2, FADD, or CASP10 abrogated
etoposide-induced apoptosis, and AK2 complexes were not observed in
several etoposide-resistant human tumor cell lines that were deficient
in expression of FADD, CASP10, or CASP3. In contrast to the findings in
human cells, etoposide-induced apoptosis was observed in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts that lacked Fadd expression. Since mice also lack Casp10,
Lee et al. (2007) concluded that mice lack an apoptotic pathway
comparable to the AK2-FADD-CASP10 pathway in humans.

Pannicke et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of zebrafish ak2 also leads
to aberrant leukocyte development, demonstrating the evolutionarily
conserved role of AK2. They concluded that their results provide in vivo
evidence for AK2 selectivity in leukocyte differentiation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 affected individuals from 5 families segregating reticular
dysgenesis (267500), Pannicke et al. (2009) identified 6 causative
mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous state
(103020.0001-103020.0006).

Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009) identified biallelic mutations in AK2
(103020.0007-103020.0013) in 7 individuals with reticular dysgenesis.
These mutations resulted in absent or strongly decreased protein
expression. The authors then demonstrated that restoration of AK2
expression in the bone marrow cells of individuals with reticular
dysgenesis overcomes the neutrophil differentiation arrest, underlining
its specific requirement in the development of a restricted set of
hematopoietic lineages. Finally, Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009)
established that AK2 is specifically expressed in the stria vascularis
region of the inner ear, which provides an explanation for the
sensorineural deafness in these individuals. Lagresle-Peyrou et al.
(2009) concluded that their results identified a previously unknown
mechanism involved in regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation
in one of the most severe human immunodeficiency syndromes.

103180	TITLE *103180 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 1; ARF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), such as ARF1, are small guanine
nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the enzymatic activities of
cholera toxin. ARFs are essential and ubiquitous in eukaryotes, being
involved in vesicular transport and functioning as activators of
phospholipase D. The functions of ARF proteins in membrane traffic and
organelle integrity are intimately tied to their reversible association
with membranes and specific interactions with membrane phospholipids. A
common feature of these functions is their regulation by the binding and
hydrolysis of GTP (summary by Bobak et al. (1989) and Amor et al.
(1994)).

CLONING

Bobak et al. (1989) cloned 2 ARF cDNAs, ARF1 and ARF3 (103190), from a
human cerebellum library. Based on deduced amino acid sequences and
patterns of hybridization of cDNA and oligonucleotide probes with
mammalian brain poly(A)+ RNA, human ARF1 is the homolog of bovine ARF1.
Human ARF3, however, appeared to represent a newly identified, third
type of ARF, which differs from bovine ARF1 and bovine ARF2. Peng et al.
(1989) also reported cloning of ADP-ribosylation factor.

Lee et al. (1992) found that human ARF1 is identical to its bovine
counterpart, has a distinctive pattern of tissue and developmental
expression, and is encoded by an mRNA of approximately 1.9 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Coatomer, or COPI (see 601924), is a heptameric protein recruited to
membranes by ARF1. Coat assembly helps in the transport of budding off
membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus.
Using fluorescence microscopy, Presley et al. (2002) showed that guanine
nucleotide exchange-activated ARF1 at the Golgi membrane recruits and
binds cytoplasmic COPI to the membranes. Photobleaching experiments
demonstrated that COPI remains at the membranes after ARF1-GTP has been
hydrolyzed by ARFGAP1 (608377). COPI binds to membrane cargo,
soluble-cargo receptors, or other Golgi proteins. Uncoating, or the
release of COPI from Golgi membranes to the cytoplasm, then occurs,
which can be inhibited by aluminum fluoride. Presley et al. (2002)
concluded from their kinetic and biochemical analyses that COPI and ARF1
continuously bind and release from Golgi membranes, allowing the
membrane at these sites to recruit cargo, alter their phospholipid
composition, and become larger, phase-separated domains.

Endocytosis of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and
the fluid phase takes place primarily through a dynamin (see DNM1;
602377)- and clathrin (see CLTC; 118955)-independent, CDC42
(116952)-regulated pinocytic mechanism. In Chinese hamster ovary cells,
Kumari and Mayor (2008) found that reduced activity or levels of Arf1
inhibited GPI-anchored protein and fluid-phase endocytosis without
affecting other clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytic pathways.
Arf1 was activated at distinct sites on the plasma membrane, and it
recruited the CDC42 GTPase-activating protein Arhgap10 (609746) to the
plasma membrane, thereby modulating cell surface Cdc42 dynamics. Kumari
and Mayor (2008) concluded that ARF1 regulates both endocytosis and
secretion and may provide a mechanism for crosstalk between these
processes.

Using a yeast genetic screen for substrates of the Shigella flexneri
type III effector protein IpaJ, Burnaevskiy et al. (2013) identified
Arf1 and Arf2 (ARF4; 601177). Mass spectrometric analysis showed that
IpaJ cleaved the peptide bond between myristoylated gly2 and asn3 of
human ARF1. Further analysis showed that IpaJ cleaved numerous
N-myristoylated proteins with various functions. Burnaevskiy et al.
(2013) concluded that IpaJ is a cysteine protease that cleaves the
N-myrisoylated glycine from ARF1, possibly as the substrate cycles
between activity-dependent conformational states. They proposed that
cleavage of lipidated proteins may be a mechanism of microbial
pathogenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Amor et al. (1994) described the 3-dimensional structure of full-length
human ARF1 in its GDP-bound nonmyristoylated form.

Mossessova et al. (1998) reported the crystal structure of the catalytic
Sec7 homology domain of ARNO (602488), a human guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) for ARF1, determined at 2.2-angstrom resolution.
The Sec7 domain is an elongated, all-helical protein with a distinctive
hydrophobic groove that is phylogenetically conserved. Structure-based
mutagenesis identifies the groove and an adjacent conserved loop as the
ARF-interacting surface. The sites of Sec7 domain interaction on ARF1
have subsequently been mapped, by protein footprinting experiments, to
the switch 1 and switch 2 GTPase regions, leading to a model for the
interaction between ARF GTPases and Sec7 domain exchange factors.

Nucleotide dissociation from small G protein-GEF complexes involves
transient GDP-bound intermediates. In the case of ARF proteins, small G
proteins that regulate membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells, such
intermediates can be trapped either by the natural inhibitor brefeldin A
or by charge reversal at the catalytic glutamate of the Sec7 domain of
their GEFs. Renault et al. (2003) reported the crystal structure of
these intermediates, which shows that membrane recruitment of ARF and
nucleotide dissociation are separate reactions stimulated by the Sec7
domain. The reactions proceed through sequential rotations of the
Arf-GDP core towards the Sec7 catalytic site, and are blocked by
interfacial binding of brefeldin A and unproductive stabilization of GDP
by charge reversal.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1992) determined that the ARF1 gene has 4 introns and spans
approximately 16.5 kb. Exon 1 (46 bp) contains only untranslated
sequence. The 5-prime flanking region has a high GC content but no TATA
or CAAT box, as found in housekeeping genes. The authors stated that the
2 human class I ARF genes, ARF1 and ARF3, have similar exon/intron
organizations and use GC-rich promoters.

MAPPING

Hirai et al. (1996) obtained an expressed sequence tag related to the
ARF1 gene and used fluorescence in situ hybridization to assign ARF1 to
1q42.

610152	TITLE *610152 CENTROMERIC PROTEIN M; CENPM
;;PROLIFERATION-ASSOCIATED NUCLEAR ELEMENT 1; PANE1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The centromere is a specialized chromatin domain, present throughout the
cell cycle, that acts as a platform on which the transient assembly of
the kinetochore occurs during mitosis. All active centromeres are
characterized by the presence of long arrays of nucleosomes in which
CENPA (117139) replaces histone H3 (see 602810). CENPM is an additional
factor required for centromere assembly (Foltz et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of mouse Pane1, Bierie et al. (2004)
identified human CENPM, which they called PANE1. The deduced protein
contains 180 amino acids. In silico analysis suggested that PANE1 was
expressed predominantly in cancer tissues. Dot and Northern blot
analyses revealed highest expression of a 1.2-kb transcript in fetal
liver, thymus, and spleen, as well as in lymphoid cells and tumor cell
lines, including B- and T-cell leukemias. PANE1 was expressed in
activated, but not resting, B and T lymphocytes. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed nuclear localization of PANE1 in nonconfluent culture
cells, but not in confluent or dividing cells.

Brickner et al. (2006) identified a novel minor histocompatibility
antigen (mHAg) recognized by a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone derived from
a hemopoietic cell transplant recipient. By database analysis, they
determined that the mHAg is encoded by 1 of 11 variants of PANE1. The
variant, designated transcript K, contains a unique first exon and a
second exon common to 5 of the longer PANE1 variants, including
transcript C, which encodes the full-length form. Transcript K encodes a
58-amino acid protein whose 46 C-terminal amino acids are identical to
those of the full-length protein. Immunogenicity of the mHAg resulted
from a nonsense SNP in the unique exon 1 of transcript K. Quantitative
RT-PCR analysis detected selective expression of transcript K in
B-lymphoid cells, with highest expression in resting B cells and B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Transcript C was selectively
expressed in activated B cells, suggesting a reciprocal expression
pattern for transcripts K and C. Brickner et al. (2006) proposed that
PANE1 is a potential therapeutic target in B-lineage chronic lymphocytic
leukemia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bierie et al. (2004) determined that the CENPM gene contains 6 exons and
spans 8.4 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of CENPA-containing complexes from HeLa cells,
followed by multiple tandem affinity purifications, Foltz et al. (2006)
identified CENPM as a component of a CENPA nucleosome-associated
complex. Epitope-tagged CENPM bound to centromeres throughout interphase
and during mitosis. CENPM, CENPN (611509), CENPT (611510), and CENPU
(MLF1IP; 611511), together with CENPC (117141) and CENPH (605607), bound
CENPA in a proximal nucleosome-associated complex. Small interfering RNA
(siRNA)-mediated depletion of CENPM disrupted recruitment of the core
complex, caused the loss of CENPN from centromeres, and increased the
number of cells in mitosis.

Okada et al. (2006) found that chicken B cells expressing a conditional
Cenpm deletion stopped proliferating and died following induction of the
deletion. Cenpm deletion led to loss of centromeric localization of
Cenph, Cenpi, Cenpk (611502), and Cenpl (611503), and while preexisting
Cenpa was stable, incorporation of newly synthesized Cenpa into
centromeres appeared defective in mutant cells.

102750	TITLE *102750 ADENOSINE KINASE; ADK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ADK gene encodes adenosine kinase (ATP:adenosine
5-prime-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.20), an abundant enzyme in
mammalian tissues that catalyzes the transfer of the gamma-phosphate
from ATP to adenosine, thereby serving as a potentially important
regulator of concentrations of both extracellular adenosine and
intracellular adenine nucleotides. Adenosine has widespread effects on
the cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory, and immune systems, and
inhibitors of ADK could play an important pharmacologic role in
increasing intravascular adenosine concentrations and acting as
inflammatory agents (summary by Spychala et al., 1996).

CLONING

Spychala et al. (1996) obtained full-length cDNA clones encoding
catalytically active ADK from lymphocyte, placental, and liver cDNA
libraries. On Northern blots of all tissues examined, they identified
mRNA species of 1.3 and 1.8 kb, attributable to alternative
polyadenylation sites at the 3-prime end of the gene. The encoded
protein consisted of 345 amino acids with a calculated molecular size of
38.7 kD and without any sequence similarities to other
well-characterized mammalian nucleoside kinases. In contrast, 2 regions
were identified with significant sequence identity to microbial
ribokinase and fructokinases and a bacterial inosine/guanosine kinase.
Thus, ADK is a structurally distinct mammalian nucleoside kinase that
appears to be akin to sugar kinases of microbial origin.

McNally et al. (1997) also cloned human cDNAs encoding adenosine kinase.
They found cDNAs encoding both the 345-amino acid form and a 362-amino
acid form of the enzyme. These 2 alternately spliced forms differed only
at the 5-prime end. When expressed, both isoforms of the enzyme
phosphorylated adenosine with identical kinetics and both required Mg2+
for activity.

MAPPING

The structural gene for this enzyme was tentatively assigned to
chromosome 10 by somatic cell hybrid studies (Klobutcher et al., 1976).
By the principle of gene dosage, Francke and Thompson (1979) concluded
by exclusion that ADK must be in the region 10q11-10q24.

In a case of trisomy 10p, Snyder et al. (1984) found normal levels of
ADK.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By exome sequencing, Bjursell et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
mutation in the ADK gene (102750.0001) in 2 Swedish sibs with severe
developmental delay, mild liver dysfunction, and persistent
hypermethioninemia due to adenosine kinase deficiency (614300).
Subsequent analysis of this gene in Malaysian patients with a similar
phenotype revealed 2 different homozygous mutations in the ADK gene
(102750.0002 and 102750.0003) in 2 families. The phenotype was
characterized by global developmental delay, early-onset seizures, mild
dysmorphic features, and characteristic biochemical anomalies, including
persistent hypermethioninemia with increased levels of
S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy);
homocysteine was typically normal. Bjursell et al. (2011) concluded that
the phenotype resulted from a combination of direct adenosine toxicity,
a defect in the regulation of adenosine, and disruption of a wide range
of methyltransferase reactions.

ANIMAL MODEL

Neonatal hepatic steatosis (228100) is a fatal condition characterized
by rapid microvesicular fat infiltration and enlargement of the liver,
which shows a pale and yellowish coloration. Microvesicular fat
infiltration, liver failure, coma, and death are considered to be a
consequence of severe impairment of mitochondrial function. Boison et
al. (2002) pursued the hypothesis that a deficit in adenosine-dependent
metabolism is a causative factor for the development of microvesicular
hepatic steatosis. A deficiency of adenosine kinase, the major
adenosine-removing enzyme of postnatal liver, was expected to affect
liver function on 3 levels: availability of adenine nucleotides;
disruption of the futile cycle between AMP and adenosine; and
maintenance of transmethylation reactions. Homozygous Adk -/- mice,
generated through Adk targeting of embryonic stem cells, developed
normally during embryogenesis. However, within 4 days after birth they
displayed microvesicular hepatic steatosis and died within 14 days with
fatty liver. Adenine nucleotides were decreased and
S-adenosylhomocysteine, a potent inhibitor of transmethylation
reactions, was increased in the mutant liver. Thus, a deficiency of
adenosine metabolism is identified as a powerful contributor to the
development of neonatal hepatic steatosis, providing a model for the
rapid development of postnatally lethal fatty liver.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERMETHIONINEMIA DUE TO ADENOSINE KINASE DEFICIENCY
ADK, ALA301GLU

In 2 Swedish sibs with hypermethioninemia due to adenosine kinase
deficiency (614300), Bjursell et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
902C-A transversion in the ADK gene, resulting in an ala301-to-glu
(A301E) substitution adjacent to the catalytic site. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 105
controls. In vitro functional expression studies in E. coli showed that
the mutant protein had almost no enzymatic activity.

In 2 Malaysian sibs with hypermethioninemia due to adenosine kinase
deficiency (614300), Bjursell et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
653A-C transversion in the ADK gene, resulting in an asp218-to-ala
(D218A) substitution in the central beta-sheet domain. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation. In vitro functional expression
studies in E. coli showed that the mutant protein had about 20% residual
enzymatic activity compared to wildtype.

HYPERMETHIONINEMIA DUE TO ADENOSINE KINASE DEFICIENCY
ADK, GLY13GLU

In 2 Malaysian sibs with hypermethioninemia due to adenosine kinase
deficiency (614300), Bjursell et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
38G-A transition in the ADK gene, resulting in a gly13-to-glu (G13E)
substitution close to the binding site for adenosine. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation. In vitro functional expression
studies in E. coli showed that the mutant protein had about 10% residual
enzymatic activity compared to wildtype.

605002	TITLE *605002 CORONIN 2B; CORO2B
;;CORONIN-LIKE PROTEIN C; CLIPINC
DESCRIPTION The Dictyostelium actin-binding protein coronin accumulates at the
leading edges of motile cells and in crown-shaped extensions on the
dorsal cell surface. Coronin is involved in cell motility, cytokinesis,
and phagocytosis, all of which depend on cytoskeletal rearrangement; see
CORO1A (605000).

By screening a frontal cortex cDNA library with a brain-enriched clone
showing similarity to Dictyostelium coronin, Nakamura et al. (1999)
isolated a full-length cDNA encoding CORO2B, which they called CLIPINC.
The predicted 475-amino acid CORO2B protein has an N-terminal domain
containing 5 WD repeats and a succeeding domain with a tendency to form
alpha helices. Northern blot analysis detected abundant expression of an
approximately 4.0-kb CORO2B transcript in brain, with moderate
expression in heart and ovary, and little or no expression in other
tissues tested. In contrast, CORO1A is primarily expressed in immune
system tissues, and CORO2A (602159) is predominantly expressed in colon,
prostate, and testis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Coro2a
expression in mouse cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, olfactory
bulb, and cerebellum, as well as in the inner nuclear layer of embryonic
retina and embryonic olfactory bulb. Cosedimentation analysis
demonstrated that CORO2B associates with F-actin. Immunofluorescence
analysis indicated that CORO2B accumulates at neurite tips, at focal
adhesions in association with VCL (193065), and along stress fibers.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the CORO2B
gene, which they called KIAA0925, to chromosome 15.

608692	TITLE *608692 BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER NUCLEAR FACTOR 1; BLZF1
;;JEM1;;
GOLGIN 45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display to identify transcripts upregulated following
retinoic acid stimulation of a promyelocytic leukemia cell line (NB4)
cDNA library, Duprez et al. (1997) cloned BLZF1, which they designated
JEM1. The deduced 400-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass
of 45 kD. The N-terminal region of JEM1 is followed by a basic region
containing a nuclear localization signal; a hinge region; a leucine
zipper dimerization motif; and a C-terminal PEST motif. JEM1 also
contains several phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected
a 3.0-kb transcript in T-cell leukemia, pro-B, pre-B, myeloma, and
plasmacytoma cell lines, but not in Burkitt lymphoma cells. Expression
of JEM1 was also detected in several normal tissues, including adrenal
gland. Epitope-tagged JEM1 was expressed in a punctate staining pattern
in the nuclei of transfected COS-7 cells; it was excluded from nucleoli.
SDS-PAGE of in vitro translated cDNA detected JEM1 at an apparent
molecular mass of 42 kD.

By analyzing ESTs, Tong et al. (2000) determined that JEM1 is expressed
ubiquitously. They identified a JEM1 splice variant, designated JEM1s,
generated by exon 3 extension and polyadenylation. The deduced 174-amino
acid JEM1s protein lacks the leucine repeat, the PEST domain, and
several terminal phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected
both variants in NB4 cell RNA. Western blot analysis of transfected cell
lysates detected JEM1s at an apparent molecular mass of 23 kD. Confocal
analysis of transfected cells showed that JEM1s localized to the
cytoplasm rather than the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Duprez et al. (1997) found that expression of JEM1 was enhanced in NB4
cells 24 to 72 hours after retinoic acid treatment, prior to sudden
growth arrest.

Tong et al. (2000) determined that retinoids increased reporter
transcript expression in HeLa cells transfected with JEM1.

Short et al. (2001) presented evidence that mammalian Blzf1, which they
designated golgin-45, interacts with the medial-Golgi matrix protein
Grasp55 (608693) and with the GTP-bound form of Rab2 (179509), but not
with other Golgi Rab proteins. Depletion of Blzf1 disrupted the Golgi
apparatus and caused a block in secretory protein transport. Short et
al. (2001) concluded that Grasp55 and Blzf1 form a Rab2 effector complex
on medial Golgi essential for normal protein transport and Golgi
structure.

GENE STRUCTURE

Duprez et al. (1997) determined that the 5-prime UTR of BLZF1 contains
typical Sp1 (189906) enhancer elements. The 3-prime UTR contains 3
polyadenylation sequences.

Tong et al. (2000) determined that the BLZF1 gene contains 7 exons and
spans more than 34 kb. The promoter region lacks a TATA box, Inr motifs,
or DPE motifs, but it contains a typical CCAAT box. BLZF1 has cis-acting
elements for several transcriptional regulators, but no retinoic acid
receptor (see 180240) elements or retinoid X receptor (see 180245)
elements. The 3-prime UTR region upstream of the polyadenylation sites
contains numerous repetitive elements.

MAPPING

By FISH, Duprez et al. (1997) mapped the BLZF1 gene to chromosome 1q24.

606649	TITLE *606649 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TYPE 1 ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN 3; HIVEP3
;;ZAS FAMILY, MEMBER 3; ZAS3;;
KRC, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; KRC;;
SCHNURRI, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; SHN3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ZAS family, such as ZAS3 (HIVEP3), are large proteins
that contain a ZAS domain, a modular protein structure consisting of a
pair of C2H2 zinc fingers with an acidic-rich region and a
serine/threonine -rich sequence. These proteins bind specific DNA
sequences, including the kappa-B motif (GGGACTTTCC), in the promoters
and enhancer regions of several genes and viruses, including human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). ZAS genes span more than 150 kb and
contain at least 10 exons, one of which is longer than 5.5 kb (summary
by Allen and Wu, 2004).

CLONING

Hicar et al. (2001) cloned HIVEP3, a member of the HIVEP family (see
HIVEP1; 194540). HIVEPs encode large zinc finger proteins and regulate
transcription via the kappa-B enhancer motif. HIVEP3 is homologous to
the mouse Krc (kappa-B-binding and recognition component of the V(D)J
recombination signal sequence) protein. The largest open reading frame
of HIVEP3 contains 2,406 amino acids and is 80% identical to Krc. RNA
studies showed that multiple HIVEP3 transcripts are differentially
expressed and regulated. Transcription termination occurs in the
ultimate exon, exon 10, or in exon 6. Therefore, HIVEP3 may produce
protein isoforms that contain or exclude the C-terminal DNA-binding
domain and the leucine zipper by alternative RNA splicing and
differential polyadenylation.

GENE FUNCTION

Oukka et al. (2002) described a function for the zinc finger
transcription factor Krc in regulating patterns of gene activation in
response to proinflammatory stimuli. Krc overexpression inhibited, while
antisense or dominant-negative Krc enhanced, NF-kappa-B (NFKB; see
164011)-dependent transactivation and JNK (601158) phosphorylation and
consequently inhibited apoptosis and cytokine gene expression. The
effect of Krc was mediated through its interaction with the adaptor
protein TRAF2 (601895). Oukka et al. (2002) concluded that Krc is a
participant in the signal transduction pathway leading from the TNF
receptor (see 602746) to gene activation and may play a critical role in
inflammatory and apoptotic responses.

Hong et al. (2003) found an absence of non-Rel kappa-B protein and
constitutive nuclear expression and activation of the NFKB p65 subunit
(RELA; 164014) in immortalized pre-B-cell lines from a malignant mouse
teratoma that spontaneously developed in a Zas3 -/- Rag2 (179616) -/-
mouse. The results suggested that ZAS3 modulates NFKB transcriptional
activation.

Using T-cell lines, Oukka et al. (2004) showed that KRC was induced by
T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880) signaling and enhanced IL2 (147680)
production by binding to JUN (165160) and coactivating AP1 (165160),
which bound the IL2 promoter.

Jones et al. (2006) showed that Schnurri-3 (Shn3), a mammalian homolog
of the Drosophila zinc-finger adaptor protein Shn, is an essential
regulator of adult bone formation. Mice lacking Shn3 display adult-onset
osteosclerosis with increased bone mass due to augmented osteoblast
activity. Shn3 was found to control protein levels of Runx2 (600211),
the principal transcriptional regulator of osteoblast differentiation,
by promoting its degradation through recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin
ligase WWP1 (602037) to Runx2. By this means, Runx2-mediated
extracellular matrix mineralization was antagonized, revealing an
essential role for Shn3 as a central regulator of postnatal bone mass.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Hicar et al. (2001) determined that the
HIVEP3 gene spans at least 300 kb and has 10 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hicar et al. (2001) mapped the HIVEP3 gene
to chromosome 1p34.

ANIMAL MODEL

By deleting exon 2 of the Krc gene, Oukka et al. (2004) generated mice
lacking the Krc protein but retaining normal lymphoid development and
CD4 T-cell numbers and CD4 T-cell maturation markers. CD4 T cells from
Krc -/- mice produced significantly less IL2 after TCR stimulation, but
were able to respond to exogenous IL2 with normal Ifng (147570)
production.

Jones et al. (2010) stated that Shn2 (HIVEP2; 143054) -/- mice display a
modest low-turnover osteopenia due to reduced osteoclast and osteoblast
function, whereas Shn3 -/- mice show severe osteosclerosis due to
increased osteoblast activity and elevated rate of bone formation. Jones
et al. (2010) found that Shn2 -/- Shn3 -/- double-knockout mice
displayed severe growth retardation resulting in dwarfism and did not
survive beyond 3 weeks of age. Shn2 -/- Shn3 -/- skeletal defects were
due to shortening of both axial and appendicular skeletons, incomplete
formation of thoracic vertebrae, impaired sternum development, and
shortening of proximal and distal limb bones. Increased bone mass in
Shn2 -/- Shn3 -/- mice was similar to that observed in Shn3 -/- mice and
was due to elevated osteoblast activity. Complete ablation of both Shn2
and Shn3 was necessary to perturb growth plate maturation, whereas
deletion of a single Shn3 allele was sufficient to cause increased bone
mass, which could be augmented by deletion of an Shn2 allele.

601928	TITLE *601928 KERATIN 86; KRT86
;;KERATIN, HAIR, BASIC, 6; KRTHB6;;
KERATIN, HARD, TYPE II, 6; HB6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In addition to the epithelial, or soft, alpha-keratins, the keratin
multigene family comprises the smaller family of hard alpha-keratins
that, in accordance with their most frequently investigated site of
expression, are referred to as hair keratins. Independent of species,
the hair keratin family consists of several members of each of 2
subfamilies; according to Winter et al. (1997), 7 type I human hair
keratins (e.g., KRTHA1; 601077) and 4 type II hair keratins had been
identified.

Rogers et al. (1997) reviewed human hair keratin nomenclature.
Expression studies showed that hair keratin synthesis is not restricted
to the hair follicle and the cortex but clearly begins earlier in matrix
cells of the hair bulb. Whereas both matrix and cuticle trichocytes
appear to express only 1 keratin pair each, keratin expression in the
cortex involves at least 4 sequentially synthesized, structurally highly
related keratin pairs. The keratins have highly homologous central
alpha-helical rod domains flanked by variable-sized head and tail
domains. The boundary peptides at the extremities of the rod domain (the
helix initiation motif (HIM) of the 1A subdomain and the helix
termination motif (HTM) of the 2B subdomain) are highly conserved and
crucial for structure and function. Pathogenic mutations, which have
been described in epithelial alpha-keratins in a number of hereditary
disorders of skin, skin appendages, and oral mucosa, appear most
disruptive when located in the HIMs or HTMs of keratins. See KRTHA1 for
additional general information on hair keratins.

CLONING

By screening a human scalp cDNA library with a mouse genomic sequence
corresponding to the C terminus and 3-prime noncoding region of Hb6,
Rogers et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding KRT86 (KRTHB6, or HB6).
The predicted protein has 483 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of
HB1 (602153), HB3 (602765), HB5 (602767), and HB6 are highly conserved,
with the similarity extending beyond the alpha-helical region into the
N-terminal and proximal C-terminal domains. HB6 is more closely related
to HB1 and HB3 than to HB5. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated
that type II keratin genes are sequentially activated in the hair
follicle in the following order: HB5--(HB1, HB3)--HB6. The synthesis of
HB6 mRNA begins slightly higher in the hair shaft than HB1 and HB3 mRNA
syntheses and continues much farther up, ending in the keratogenous
zone.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bowden et al. (1998) cloned the complete genomic sequence of HB6. The
HB6 gene has 9 exons and spans about 7.1 kb from the translational
initiation ATG codon to the poly(A) site. Its upstream regulatory
sequences contain a LEF1 (153245)-binding site, which is found in other
hair keratin genes.

MAPPING

Rogers et al. (1995) demonstrated that human hair keratin genes
colocalize with epithelial keratin genes on 17q12-q21 (type I genes) and
12q13 (type II genes), respectively.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Bowden et al. (1998) mapped the
HB6 gene to the type II hair keratin cluster on 12q13. The HB6 gene is
about 10 kb from the HB1 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Monilethrix (158000) is an autosomal dominant hair disorder
characterized clinically by alopecia and follicular papules. Affected
hairs have uniform elliptical nodes of normal thickness and intermittent
constrictions, internodes at which the hair easily breaks. Usually only
the scalp is involved, but in severe forms, the secondary sexual hair,
eyebrows, eyelashes, and nails may also be affected. The disorder has
been linked to the type II keratin gene cluster on 12q13 in several
pedigrees. Winter et al. (1997) analyzed a matrix basic keratin and 3
cortical basic keratins in a 4-generation British monilethrix family
with known linkage to 12q13. The gene regions encoding HIM and HTM were
amplified and sequenced. The authors detected a heterozygous G-to-A
point mutation in the first position of the glutamic acid 413 codon GAG
in the exon encoding the HTM of the cortical keratin HB6 in affected
members of the family. The mutation led to a nonconservative
glu413-to-lys (E413K; 601928.0001) substitution. A 3-generation French
monilethrix family in which linkage analysis had not been performed also
revealed a heterozygous point mutation in codon 413 in affected
individuals, but in this case, a G-to-T transversion occurred at the
third base of the codon and yielded a conservative substitution of
aspartic acid for glutamic acid-413 (E413D; 601928.0002). Winter et al.
(1997) predicted that, by analogy with epithelial keratins, a
monilethrix phenotype should also be expected from mutations in the type
I partner of HB6.

Winter et al. (1999) stated that causative mutations for monilethrix had
been found only in 2 type II cortex keratins, HB6 and HB1. In these hair
keratins, the HTM was the only site in which the mutations were located.
They described the first mutation in the HIM in the H6 gene, a change
from asn114 to asp (601928.0003). Winter et al. (1999) suggested that
monilethrix is a disease of hair cortex and that causative mutations are
restricted to type II hair keratins.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MONILETHRIX
KRT86, GLU413LYS

Winter et al. (1997) identified a glu413-to-lys (E413K) mutation in
affected members in the hair cortical basic keratin 6 in a British
monilethrix (158000) family that had been previously been found to show
linkage to a type II keratin cluster on 12q13. The mutation in the
analogous glutamic acid residue of the type II epidermal keratin 2e has
been identified in cases of ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens (600194.0002).

This mutation was originally designated GLU410LYS because the mutation
was identified in a partial HB6 cDNA clone; based on the complete HB6
sequence reported by Bowden et al. (1998), Winter et al. (1998) revised
the designation of the mutation to glu413 to lys. Glu413 to lys, the
most frequently observed mutation in monilethrix, was also found by
Korge et al. (1997) in 3 unrelated families.

Korge et al. (1998) sequenced the critical helix termination motif in
the 2B domain of the KRTHB6 gene in 13 unrelated families or cases with
monilethrix. In 5 of the 13 cases, they found the glu413-to-lys
mutation. In 8 cases, however, including 3 in which linkage data were
consistent with a defect in the type II keratin locus, no mutation was
found in this domain. These findings demonstrate that codon 413 and the
glutamic acid, which is residue 117 of the 2B helix, is a mutation
hotspot for monilethrix.

Winter et al. (1999) stated that this mutation had been found in 22
cases of monilethrix.

In 15 affected members of 2 unrelated Indian families with monilethrix,
Khandpur et al. (2004) identified the E413K mutation in the helix
termination motif (HTM) in exon 7 of the KRTHB6 gene; in each family,
the mutation segregated with polymorphisms in the HTM motif of the
KRTHB1 gene (602153): 1 with 3 novel SNPs in cis and a second with only
an intronic SNP. The 9 affected members of family 1 had a localized
severe hair defect with beaded appearance confined to the scalp and
carried the KRTHB1 polymorphisms in heterozygous state. The 6 affected
members of family 2 had a generalized unbeaded hair defect of moderate
severity and carried the KRTHB1 polymorphism with 3 SNPs in homozygous
state. Presence of both the E413K mutation and variation in the KRTHB1
gene was not observed in 150 randomly selected unaffected controls.

.0002
MONILETHRIX
KRT86, GLU413ASP

In a French family with monilethrix (158000), Winter et al. (1997)
demonstrated a glu413-to-asp amino acid substitution (G413D) in the
product of the HB6 gene. Although the same codon was involved as in the
initially studied British patient (600194.0001), the disorder was
clearly milder in the French family in which an adolescent's symptoms
were restricted largely to keratosis pilaris of the limbs.

This mutation was originally designated GLU410ASP based on a partial HB6
cDNA clone; based on the complete HB6 sequence reported by Bowden et al.
(1998), Winter et al. (1998) revised the designation of the mutation to
glu413 to asp.

.0003
MONILETHRIX
KRT86, GLU402LYS

In a patient with monilethrix (158000), Winter et al. (1999) identified
a glu402-to-lys mutation (E402K) in the HTM of cortex keratin HB6 which
was the equivalent of the E402K mutation of HB1 (602153.0002). The
mutation was detected in only 1 clinically affected individual of an
American family. Thus, the G-to-A transition represented a spontaneous
germline mutation in the HB6 gene. This finding indicated that both the
HB6/HB1 E413K substitution and the HB6/HB1 E402K substitution represent
mutation hotspots in the HTM of the type II cortex keratins.

See also 601928.0005 and Pearce et al. (1999).

In an 18-year-old woman of Turkish descent with monilethrix (158000),
van Steensel et al. (2005) identified the E402K mutation.

In 11 affected members of a 3-generation consanguineous Turkish family
segregating monilethrix, Celep et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity
for the E402K mutation in the KRT86 gene. Noting the low (1.7) lod score
obtained in this family at marker D12S390, the authors emphasized the
difficulties of mapping a heterozygous disorder in a country with a high
rate of consanguinity.

.0004
MONILETHRIX
KRT86, ASN114ASP

Winter et al. (1999) described the first monilethrix (158000)-causing
mutation in the HIM of the cortex keratin HB6. The critical
asn114-to-asp substitution was found only in affected members of a large
Swedish 3-generation kindred. Considering that since childhood, half of
the affected individuals suffered from complete baldness and follicular
keratosis, the HIM mutation seemed to be associated with a rather severe
disease phenotype.

.0005
MONILETHRIX
KRT86, GLU402GLN

Pearce et al. (1999) studied 2 unrelated monilethrix (158000) patients
and identified heterozygosity for 2 different mutations in the same
codon in exon 7 of the KRTHB6 gene. Both mutations affected the first
base of codon 402 (glutamic acid). In one patient, a G-to-C transversion
occurred causing a glutamine substitution (GAG to CAG; E402Q), whereas
in the second patient, a G-to-A transition yielded a lysine residue (GAG
to AAG; E402K 601928.0003). Both mutations disrupted a TaqI restriction
site and RFLP analysis showed that a diagnostic 361-bp fragment could
confirm the presence of the mutation.

.0006
MONILETHRIX
KRT86, ALA118GLU

In affected members of a 3-generation French family with monilethrix
(158000), Winter et al. (2000) identified a heterozygous C-to-A
transversion in exon 1 of the KRT86 gene, resulting in an ala118-to-glu
(A118E) substitution in the helix initiation motif. Winter et al. (2000)
concluded that the mutation was incompatible with stable intermediate
filament formation.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

PABPs bind to the poly(A) tail present at the 3-prime ends of most
eukaryotic mRNAs. Yang et al. (1995) isolated an activation-induced
T-cell mRNA encoding a protein similar to PABPC1 (604679). The predicted
644-amino acid protein, which they designated iPABP (inducible PABP),
shares 79% sequence identity with PABPC1. Both proteins contain 4
RNA-binding domains and proline-rich C termini, and both have very
similar RNA-binding properties. Using immunofluorescence, Yang et al.
(1995) determined that iPABP localizes primarily to the cytoplasm.
Northern blot analysis revealed that iPABP was expressed as a 3.2-kb
mRNA in all tissues tested.

Houng et al. (1997) identified iPABP as an antigen, APP1
(activated-platelet protein-1), expressed on thrombin-activated rabbit
platelets. They isolated rabbit and human APP1 cDNAs. The predicted
human and rabbit proteins are 99% identical. Houng et al. (1997) noted
that activated platelets express molecules that execute many of the
complex cellular biochemical processes that stanch the loss of blood and
begin the process of vascular repair.

GENE FUNCTION

Yang et al. (1995) showed that activation of T cells increased iPABP
mRNA levels in T cells approximately 5-fold. The authors suggested that
iPABP might be necessary for regulation of stability of labile mRNA
species in activated T cells.

Houng et al. (1997) stated that, given its similarity to PABPC1, APP1
may be involved in the regulation of protein translation in platelets
and megakaryocytes or may participate in the binding or stabilization of
polyadenylates in platelet dense granules.

MAPPING

By amplification of specific DNA fragments from a human-rodent somatic
cell hybrid panel, Feral et al. (1999) mapped the PABPC4 gene to
chromosome 1; this result, compared with radiation hybrid database
information, localized the gene to 1p36-p32.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12
ST3GAL3, ALA13ASP

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), previously reported by
Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12
ST3GAL3, ASP370TYR

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), Hu et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile

identified a homozygous 958G-C transversion in exon 12 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an ala320-to-pro (A320P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the sialyl motif S. The mutation was identified by
linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.

190450	TITLE *190450 TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE 1; TPI1
;;TPI
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI; EC 5.3.1.1) catalyzes the
interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (summary by Ationu et al., 1999).

CLONING

Electrophoretic variants of triosephosphate isomerase were identified by
the Galton Laboratory group (Hopkinson and Harris, 1971).

Brown et al. (1985) isolated the functional gene and 3 intronless
pseudogenes for human TPI from a recombinant DNA library. The
pseudogenes share a high degree of homology with the functional gene but
contain mutations that preclude synthesis of active TPI enzyme. Sequence
divergence indicated origin of the pseudogenes about 18 million years
ago. Brown et al. (1985) concluded that the human TPI gene family has
only 1 functional gene.

Yuan et al. (1979), on the basis of structural analysis, concluded that
the TPI-A and TPI-B isozymes are products of distinct structural loci.
Decker and Mohrenweiser (1981) presented evidence that triosephosphate
isomerase isozymes are the expression of a single structural locus. (The
existence of 2 TPI loci, both probably coded by chromosome 12, had been
suggested to explain the observed isozyme patterns.) They identified a
rare electrophoretic variant and found that the variant phenotype was
expressed in the TPI-B isozyme of both red cells and circulating
lymphocytes and was also expressed in the TPI-A isozyme of
mitogen-stimulated lymphoblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

TPI is a dimeric enzyme of identical subunits that is characterized by a
high constitutive level of activity in all tissues. It is involved in
both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, catalyzing the interconversion of
DHAP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. TPI is one of the most efficient
enzymes known, enhancing proton transfer by a factor of 10(10), and is
the least rate-limiting step in glycolysis (summary by Watanabe et al.,
1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Brown et al. (1985) found that the functional TPI1 gene spans 3.5 kb and
is split into 7 exons.

MAPPING

From study of 3 patients with different deletions of chromosome 12,
Rethore et al. (1976, 1977) concluded that the GAPD locus (138400) is on
the distal part of 12p, between 12p12.2 and 12pter, and that the LDHB
locus (150100) is on the middle third between 12p12.1 and 12p12.2. The
results for TPI were like those for GAPD, suggesting the same distal
localization.

Law and Kao (1978) summarized data suggesting the order
12pter--TPI--GAPD--SHMT (SHMT2; 138450) on chromosome 12. SHMT lies on
the proximal part of 12q between the centromere and PEPB (169900).

Brown et al. (1985) confirmed that the functional TPI gene is on
chromosome 12 whereas the pseudogenes are on other chromosomes.

Asakawa and Iida (1985) also found support for a single TPI locus. GPI
(172400) and PEPD (613230), which are on chromosome 19 in man, are on
chromosome 9 of the Chinese hamster, and TPI, which is on chromosome 12
of man, is on Chinese hamster chromosome 8 (Siciliano et al., 1983).

OTHER FEATURES

TPI was 1 of 4 representative 'ancient' proteins used by Stoltzfus et
al. (1994) to test the exon theory of genes. Spliceosomal introns are
present in the nuclear protein-coding genes of most eukaryotic
organisms, but they have not been detected in several eukaryotic protist
phyla or in eubacteria, archaebacteria, and organelles. Two major
theories had emerged in the continuing debate on the origin of these
introns. The exon theory of genes (sometimes called the introns-early
view) proposed that exons are the descendants of ancient mini-genes and
introns are the descendants of the spaces between them; genes large
enough to encode contemporary proteins were first assembled from sets of
exons; the machinery of splicing originated in an ancient RNA world; and
introns were lost completely from both kingdoms of bacteria as well as
several protist groups. In contrast, the insertional theory of intron
origin (also known as the introns-late view) holds that split genes
arise from uninterrupted genes by insertion of introns; genes large
enough to encode contemporary proteins first arose (presumably from
smaller genes) without the participation of introns; the machinery of
spliceosomal splicing arose from fragmented self-splicing introns; and
spliceosomal introns were never present in the ancestors of those
organisms that now lack them. The analysis performed by Stoltzfus et al.
(1994) on TPI, the globins, pyruvate kinase, and alcohol dehydrogenase
demonstrated no significant correspondence between exons and units of
protein structure, suggesting that the putative correspondence does not
exist and that the exon theory of genes is untenable.

The chicken-and-egg question of which came first--exons or introns--was
studied, using TPI as a model, also by Kwiatowski et al. (1995) and
Logsdon et al. (1995). Each group looked at the positions of introns in
homologous TPI genes from a number of phylogenetically diverse species.
Both groups concluded that introns were gained comparatively recently in
eukaryotic evolution by insertion into preexisting genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Eber et al. (1979) identified 5 persons heterozygous for a TPI null
allele.

Maquat et al. (1985) concluded that the genetic basis of TPI deficiency
is heterogeneous: normal levels of TPI mRNA were found in 1 homozygote
and about 40% of normal in another. The rare homozygous deficient
persons usually have 3 to 10% of normal enzyme activity.

Daar et al. (1986) and Pekrun et al. (1995) identified homoygosity for a
glu104-to-asp (E104D; 190450.0001) mutation in the TPI1 gene in patients
with triosephosphate deficiency. Arya et al. (1997) found that among 7
unrelated Northern European kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency, the
glu104-to-asp mutation accounted for 11 of 14 (79%) mutant alleles.
Haplotype analysis supported a founder effect.

Studies by Boyer et al. (1989) and Boyer and Maquat (1990) identified
several sequences in the 5-prime region that appear to be required for
maintenance of normal levels of gene expression. These include a CAP
proximal element (CPE) spanning nucleotides -6 and -12. The -5A-G and
-8G-A substitutions identified by Watanabe et al. (1996) are located
within the CPE region. The observation that all 7 affected individuals
shared the same variant CPE allele, an allele that does not exist at
higher frequency in the general African American population, suggested
to the authors a common origin for this TPI-deficiency allele; how the
allele frequency is maintained at such a high level was unclear.

Watanabe et al. (1996) undertook the molecular characterization of the
variant alleles from 7 African American and 3 Caucasian individuals from
the unrelated group identified in the frequency studies. In Caucasians
they found 3 amino acid substitutions, all in residues that are not
directly involved in the enzyme's active site but are highly conserved
through evolutionary time, suggesting important roles for these residues
in maintenance of subunit structure and conformation. One of the amino
acid substitutions, glu104-to-asp (190450.0001), had been previously
identified in cases of hemolytic anemia due to TPI deficiency. The
variant allele in the 7 African American individuals had nucleotide
changes at positions -8 and -5 on the 5-prime side of the
transcription-initiation site.

In a study of 424 African American subjects and 75 white subjects,
Schneider et al. (1998) found that the -5 (592A-G), -8 (382G-A), and -24
(573T-G) variants in the triosephosphate isomerase gene occurred
frequently (41%) in the African American subjects but did not occur in
whites. These data suggested that this set of polymorphisms may be one
of the higher-incidence molecular markers of African lineage. Although
the variant substitutions (occurring in 3 haplotypes: -5 alone, -5 -8,
and -5 -8 -24) were associated with moderate reduction in enzyme
activity, severe deficiency heterozygotes could not be identified with
certainty, and none of the haplotypes was restricted to subjects with
marked reduction of enzyme activity. Three subjects were homozygous for
the -5 -8 haplotype, a finding inconsistent with the putative role of
this haplotype as the cause of a null variant incompatible with life in
homozygotes, as had been suggested in the past for the rarity of
homozygotes with TPI deficiency in African Americans. Despite these
findings, Schneider et al. (1998) admitted the possibility that the -5
-8 or -5 -8 -24 haplotypes may in some instances contribute to compound
heterozygosity and clinical TPI deficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gnerer et al. (2006) identified a recessive hypomorphic mutation in
Drosophila, which they called 'wasted away' (wstd), that causes
progressive motor impairment, vacuolar neuropathology, and severely
reduced life span. They found that wstd was caused by a mutation in the
Tpi1 gene. The mutation did not result in a significant deficit in ATP,
and the authors suggested that the lack of TPI1 activity may cause the
accumulation of toxic metabolites upstream of the enzymatic block.

HISTORY

From studies in the cri-du-chat syndrome (123450), Sparkes et al. (1969)
suggested that the TPI locus is on the short arm of chromosome 5. Others
failed to confirm this (Brock and Singer, 1970). Cell hybridization
studies indicated that the TPI locus is on chromosome 12.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, GLU104ASP

In 2 unrelated patients with TPI deficiency (615512), Daar et al. (1986)
found a guanine-to-cytosine transversion in the codon for amino acid
104, resulting in a structurally altered protein in which a glutamate
residue was replaced by an aspartate residue. The importance of
glutamate-104 to enzyme structure and function was indicated by its
conservation in the TPI protein of all species characterized to date.
The glutamate-to-aspartate substitution resulted in a thermolabile
enzyme. The same mutation was identified in an Australian family by
Chang et al. (1993). The alteration of codon 104 was from GAG to GAC.

Pekrun et al. (1995) found this same mutation in a family with severe
TPI deficiency. The 1-year-old index patient suffered from hemolytic
anemia, neuromuscular impairment, and recurrent pneumonia, with the
necessity of intermittent mechanical ventilation. TPI activity in red
cells was reduced to about 20% of normal. Heat stability of the enzyme
was strongly reduced; concentration of the physiologic substrate,
dihydroxyacetone phosphate, was increased 20-fold due to the metabolic
block. During a second pregnancy, examination of a cord blood sample
obtained in the nineteenth gestational week showed that the infant was
homozygous normal. An unaffected, healthy newborn was delivered. The
parents were consanguineous and of Turkish origin.

Arya et al. (1997) found that among 7 unrelated Northern European
kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency, the glu104-to-asp mutation
accounted for 11 (79%) of 14 mutant alleles. In 3 families, molecular
analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for glu104 to asp and novel
missense mutations (see 190450.0004 and 190450.0005). The origin of the
glu104-to-asp mutation was defined by haplotype analysis using a novel
G/A polymorphism at nucleotide 2898 of the TPI gene. Cosegregation of
the low frequency 2898A allele with the G-to-C base change at nucleotide
315, responsible for the glu104-to-asp amino acid substitution,
supported a single origin for that mutation, i.e., founder effect.

.0002
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE MANCHESTER
TPI-MANCHESTER
TPI1, GLY122ARG

In a screening of more than 3,400 persons in an Ann Arbor, Michigan,
population, Perry and Mohrenweiser (1992) found only 1 example of a TPI
electromorph variant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA products and subsequent
direct sequencing identified a G-to-A transition causing a replacement
of gly122 with arg in this electrophoretic mobility variant of TPI which
was referred to as TPI-Manchester. The substitution was at the amino
terminus or solvent interaction end of the fifth beta sheet of the
alpha/beta barrel structure. TPI-Manchester was found to be thermolabile
but the stability of the variant enzyme was not sensitive to other
denaturants.

.0003
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI-HUNGARY
TPI1, PHE240LEU

In a Hungarian family, Chang et al. (1993) found that the proband with
TPI deficiency (615512), who had chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia
but no neuromuscular disabilities, was a genetic compound. One of the
mutations was a missense mutation within codon 240 that changed TTC
(phe) to CTC (leu) and created a thermolabile protein. The substitution
occurred in a phylogenetically conserved amino acid and affected enzyme
activity by disrupting intersubunit contacts or substrate binding, as
deduced from enzyme structural studies. The nature of the other mutation
was not identified (see 190450.0006), but it had the effect of reducing
the abundance of TPI mRNA 10- to 20-fold. The same family was also
reported by Hollan et al. (1993) who gave clinical details on the
13-year-old boy with congenital hemolytic anemia and hyperkinetic
torsion dyskinesia associated with severe TPI deficiency, and on his
brother, a 23-year-old amateur wrestler, who also had congenital
hemolytic anemia but no neurologic symptoms. The latter was the proband
in the study of Chang et al. (1993), which demonstrated compound
heterozygosity. (Hollan et al. (1993) incorrectly referred to the
brothers as being double heterozygotes.) Both had less than 10% TPI
activity and a greatly increased dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) level
in their red blood cells. Their TPI had a slow electrophoretic mobility
and was heat unstable. Both parents and a third brother were healthy
heterozygotes. The older brother represented a unique phenotype since
all published homozygotes had severe neurologic alterations from infancy
or early childhood except 1 infant who died at 11 months, probably too
young for neurologic symptoms to be noted. Furthermore, in contrast to
the 2 affected Hungarian brothers, all but 1 homozygote had died before
the age of 6 years.

.0004
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, CYS41TYR

In 2 families with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (615512), Arya
et al. (1997) found compound heterozygosity for the common glu104-to-asp
mutation (190450.0001) and a previously unknown missense mutation, cys41
to tyr, due to a TGT-to-TAT transition.

.0005
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, ILE170VAL

In a family with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (615512), Arya et
al. (1997) found that affected individuals showed compound
heterozygosity for the common glu104-to-asp substitution (190450.0001)
and a novel ile170-to-val missense mutation.

.0006
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, GLU145TER

In a Hungarian family with severe TPI deficiency (615512) originally
described by Chang et al. (1993), Orosz et al. (2001) analyzed 2
germline-identical but phenotypically different brothers who were
compound heterozygotes for the F240L mutation (190450.0003) and a
glu145-to-ter (E145X) mutation. The kinetic, thermodynamic, and
associative properties of the recombinant human wildtype and F240L
mutant enzymes were compared with those of TPIs in normal and deficient
erythrocyte hemolysates. The specific activity of the recombinant mutant
enzyme relative to the wildtype was much higher (30%) than expected from
the activity (3%) measured in hemolysates. Comparative studies of the
hemolysate from a British patient with glu104-to-asp (190450.0001)
homozygosity (Ationu et al., 1999) and the platelet lysates from the
Hungarian family suggested that the microcompartmentation of TPI is not
unique for the hemolysates from the Hungarian TPI-deficient brothers.

147360	TITLE *147360 INVOLUCRIN; IVL
DESCRIPTION The crosslinked envelope of the keratinocyte is formed in the last stage
of its terminal differentiation. This envelope is made up of membrane
and cytosolic proteins crosslinked by glutamyl lysine isopeptide bonds.
The most abundant component is involucrin, a keratinocyte protein that
appears first in the cytoplasm but ultimately becomes crosslinked to
membrane proteins by transglutaminase. Eckert and Green (1986) cloned
the involucrin gene and studied its structure and evolution. The gene
consists of 585 amino acids, 390 of which form a central decapeptide
repeat, rich in glutamine and glutamic acid. Teumer and Green (1989)
described the divergent evolution of the IVL gene in gorilla and human.
Green and Djian (1992) reviewed the alterations in the involucrin gene
during evolution of primates from nonprimates. As reflected in the 17
species examined, the changes involved short tandem repeats. Evolution
of the IVL gene took place through mechanisms that shortened the length
of the repeats, increased their number, and changed their codon
sequence. As part of this trend, one entire segment of repeats was
replaced by another located elsewhere in the coding region.

Stroh et al. (1987) used a genomic clone to probe a panel of
human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and map the involucrin gene to
chromosome 1. By in situ hybridization using the same probe, maximal
hybridization was observed to bands 1q21-q22, with weak hybridization to
1p35-p36. They concluded that band 1q21 is the most likely location of
the IVL gene. Simon et al. (1989) presented the data for mapping of the
IVL gene. They also described a PstI RFLP, which they demonstrated in 1
individual to be the absence of 39 repeats that make up two-thirds of
the coding region of the IVL gene. Simon et al. (1991) gave further
information on the polymorphism in the coding region in the involucrin
gene in higher primates, which results from the variable number of
tandem repeats (VNTR) of a 10-codon sequence. Confirmation of the
localization of the IVL gene to 1q21 was provided by Volz et al. (1993),
who demonstrated physical linkage within 2.05 Mb of DNA to several other
genes involved in epidermal differentiation and known to be located in
that area.

Green (1993) pointed to the relevance of the expanded poly(CAG) in the
coding region of genes leading to 3 disorders: spinal and bulbar
muscular atrophy (313200), Huntington disease (143100), and
spinocerebellar ataxia type I (164400). Multiple glutamine residues,
usually encoded by CAG, are necessary for the crosslinking of involucrin
to other proteins by the keratinocyte transglutaminase during terminal
differentiation in the keratinocytes with formation of the insoluble
envelope of the corneocyte. Reiteration of the CAG codon appears to be
very frequent. Of all the animal and plant protein sequences in 2
databases, Green (1993) found that 33 contained a sequence of 16 or more
reiterated glutamines, but not one contained a run of more than 38
glutamines; hence, all showed a number of repeats lower than that in the
abnormal alleles of the 3 human diseases of CAG reiteration. Therefore,
reiteration must in some way be restricted in order to prevent genomic
havoc.

The IVL gene has evolved rapidly in higher primates (Green and Djian,
1992). Djian et al. (1995) observed that, although all mammalian IVL
genes examined to date possess a segment of short tandem repeats in the
coding region, the higher primates possess a segment of repeats that is
different from that of other mammals. This segment has enlarged
progressively mainly in the region not far from the 5-prime end of the
segment of repeats. The site of recent repeat additions is located in
the late region, which is polymorphic with respect to number of repeats
in most higher primates, including the human. The repeat pattern in the
late region of the human IVL gene does not resemble that of other
hominoids. Caucasians and Africans were found by Simon et al. (1991) and
by Urquhart and Gill (1993) to differ in repeat patterns within this
region and at certain nucleotide positions. Djian et al. (1995) observed
that there are over 8 polymorphic forms based on the number and kind of
10-codon tandem repeats in that part of the coding region most recently
added in the human lineage. The IVL alleles of Caucasians and Africans
differ both in nucleotide sequence and repeat patterns. Djian et al.
(1995) showed that the IVL alleles in East Asians (Chinese and Japanese)
can be divided into 2 populations according to whether they possess the
2 marker nucleotides typical of Africans or Caucasians. The Asian
population bearing Caucasian-type marker nucleotides had repeat patterns
similar to those of Caucasians, whereas Asians bearing African-type
marker nucleotides had repeat patterns resembling those of Africans more
than those of Caucasians. The existence of 2 populations of East Asian
IVL alleles gave support for the existence of a Eurasian stem lineage
from which Caucasians and a part of the Asian population originated.

Lopez-Bayghen et al. (1996) characterized the 5-prime noncoding region
of IVL and concluded that the region contains a distal
CaCl(2)-responsive enhancer, a putative transcriptional silencer, and a
proximal enhancer.

604769	TITLE *604769 PEROXIREDOXIN 3; PRDX3
;;PRX3;;
ANTIOXIDANT PROTEIN 1; AOP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Peroxiredoxins inactivate H2O2 by oxidizing a key cysteine residue in
their catalytic center, which is subsequently reduced by thioredoxins
(see 187700). The thioredoxins are subsequently reduced by electrons
from NADPH via thioredoxin reductases (see TXNRD1; 601112). PRDX3 is
localized exclusively in mitochondria (summary by Chiribau et al.,
2008).

CLONING

The mouse Aop1 protein, also called Mer5, may promote early events in
the differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells (Nemoto et
al., 1990). Tsuji et al. (1995) found that mouse Aop1 shares 38% amino
acid sequence identity with the C22 subunit of Salmonella typhimurium
alkylhydroperoxide reductase.

By screening a human leukemia cell line cDNA library with a mouse Aop1
cDNA, Tsuji et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA encoding human AOP1. The
deduced 256-amino acid human AOP1 protein shares 86% amino acid sequence
similarity with mouse Aop1, and significant similarity with both the
human proliferation-associated gene A product (PAGA; 176763) and the
mouse stress-induced peritoneal macrophage protein Msp23. AOP1 also
shows sequence similarity to the S. cerevisiae thiol-specific
antioxidant protein TSA; a surface antigen of Entamoeba histolytica,
which is a pathogenic protozoan that causes diarrhea and organ abscess
formation; and a protein of H. pylori, which is a causative agent in
gastritis, ulcers, and gastric adenocarcinoma.

GENE FUNCTION

Tsuji et al. (1995) demonstrated that recombinant mouse Aop1 could
complement an alkylhydroperoxide reductase mutation in E. coli,
suggesting that Aop1 functions as an antioxidant protein.

Shih et al. (2001) determined that AOP1 interacts with Abrin A-chain
(ABRA), which inhibits protein synthesis and can induce apoptosis. By
immunolocalization studies, they determined that both AOP1 and ABRA
colocalize within the mitochondria. By assays of thiol-dependent
antioxidant activity, they determined that ABRA can attenuate AOP1
activity in a dose-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of AOP1 also
blocked the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and inhibited
apoptosis in ABRA-treated cells.

Deregulated expression of the MYC transcription factor (190080) is found
in a wide variety of human tumors. The primary transforming activity of
MYC is thought to arise through transcriptional regulation of numerous
target genes. Wonsey et al. (2002) showed that PRDX3, which encodes a
mitochondrial protein of the peroxiredoxin gene family, is such a
target. Expression of PRDX3 is induced by MYC and is reduced in c-myc
-/- cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis spanning the entire
PRDX3 genomic sequence revealed that MYC binds preferentially to a
930-bp region surrounding exon 1. Wonsey et al. (2002) showed that PRDX3
is required for MYC-mediated proliferation, transformation, and
apoptosis after glucose withdrawal. Results using mitochondria-specific
fluorescent probes demonstrated that PRDX3 is essential for maintaining
mitochondrial mass and membrane potential in transformed rat and human
cells. These data provided evidence that PRDX3 is a MYC target gene that
is required to maintain normal mitochondrial function.

Chiribau et al. (2008) found that the forkhead box transcription factor
FOXO3A (602681) was required for basal expression of PRX3 in human
cardiac fibroblasts. They identified 2 FOXO regulatory sequences in the
promoter region of PRX3 and showed that binding of FOXO3A to both
regulatory sequences was required for FOXO3A-mediated activation of a
PRX3 reporter plasmid. Chiribau et al. (2008) concluded that FOXO3A
mediates PRX3 expression and suggested that this regulation may play a
critical role in the resistance to oxidative stress in cardiac
fibroblasts.

MAPPING

By FISH, Tsuji et al. (1995) mapped the human AOP1 gene, also known as
PRDX3, to 10q25-q26. They mapped the mouse Aop1 gene to the distal
region of chromosome 19.

SLC21A9, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening human brain cDNAs for the potential to encode proteins that
are at least 50 kD, Nagase et al. (1998) isolated an SLC21A9 cDNA, which
they called KIAA0880, that contains a complete coding sequence. The
predicted 709-amino acid SLC21A9 protein contains 8 membrane-spanning
regions. SLC21A9 shares 42.8% amino acid sequence identity with a rat
prostaglandin transporter across 678 residues. RT-PCR followed by ELISA
detected SLC21A9 expression in all human tissues examined, with the
highest expression in liver, lower expression in lung, ovary, brain,
heart, kidney, pancreas, spleen, and testis, and lowest expression in
skeletal muscle.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to OATP (SLCO1A2;
602883), followed by RT-PCR of adult brain RNA, Tamai et al. (2000)
cloned SLCO2B1, which they designated OATPB. The deduced 709-amino acid
protein has 12 potential transmembrane regions and several
phosphorylation and N-glycosylation sites. RT-PCR detected OATPB
expression in adult pancreas, liver, lung, gut, ovary, testis, and
spleen, and in all fetal tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are a family of
multispecific carriers that mediate the sodium-independent transport of
steroid hormone and conjugates, drugs, and numerous anionic endogenous
substrates. St-Pierre et al. (2002) investigated whether members of the
OATP gene family could mediate fetal-maternal transfer of anionic
steroid conjugates in the human placenta. They isolated OATPB from a
placenta cDNA library. An antiserum to OATPB detected an 85-kD protein
in basal but not apical syncytiotrophoblast membranes.
Immunohistochemistry of first-, second-, and third-trimester placenta
showed staining in the cytotrophoblast membranes and at the basal
surface of the syncytiotrophoblast. Trophoblasts that reacted with an
antibody to Ki-67, a proliferation-associated antigen, expressed lower
levels of OATPB. OATPB mRNA levels were measured in isolated
trophoblasts under culture conditions that promoted syncytia formation.
Real-time quantitative PCR estimated an 8-fold increase in OATPB
expression on differentiation to syncytia. Pregnenolone sulfate
partially inhibited OATPB-mediated transport of estrone-3-sulfate in an
oocyte expression system. The authors concluded that these findings
suggested a physiologic role for OATPB in the placental uptake of
fetal-derived sulfated steroids.

Tamai et al. (2000) overexpressed OATPB in HEK293 cells and found that
it mediated transport of estrone-3-sulfate and, more weakly,
prostaglandin E2.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nagase et al. (1998)
mapped the SLC21A9 gene to chromosome 11. By radiation hybrid analysis,
Tamai et al. (2000) mapped the SLCO2B1 gene to chromosome 11, between
markers D11S916 and D11S911.

;;CHROMOSOME 1 OPEN READING FRAME 77; C1OORF77;;
SMALL PROTEIN RICH IN ARGININE AND GLYCINE; SRAG;;
FRIEND OF PRMT1; FOP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Zullo et al. (2009) cloned 3 splice
variants of CHTOP, which they called SRAG, SRAG3, and SRAG5. SRAG
encodes the full-length 248-amino acid protein, which contains a central
arginine- and glycine-rich domain similar to that found in nucleolin
(NCL; 164035) and fibrillarin (FBL; 134795). Compared with the
full-length SRAG protein, SRAG3 contains an N-terminal deletion, and
SRAG5 encodes a protein with a partial deletion within the arginine- and
glycine-rich domain. Western blot analysis of mouse tissues revealed
widespread Srag expression, with highest levels in thymus, spleen, and
lymph node. Srag3 was expressed in lung only, and Srag5 was expressed in
stomach only. Endogenous HEK293 cell SRAG protein migrated as a doublet
with an apparent molecular mass of about 28 kD. Cell fractionation and
extraction experiments revealed that SRAG was predominantly a nuclear
protein, with some nucleolar localization. SRAG5, but not SRAG3, was
also detected in nucleoli. However, immunofluorescence microscopy of
transfected HeLa cells revealed that fluorescence-tagged SRAG and SRAG5
were nucleolar in 25 to 35% of cells, whereas SRAG3 was nucleolar in
nearly 100% of cells. Database analysis revealed SRAG orthologs in
vertebrates, but not invertebrates.

Van Dijk et al. (2010) cloned mouse Chtop, which they designated Fop,
and by database analysis, they identified full-length human FOP. The
mouse and human FOP proteins both contain 249 amino acids. A second FOP
isoform may be translated from a conserved internal methionine at
residue 26. Full-length FOP has a central glycine- and arginine-rich
(GAR) domain and 2 copies of a 9-amino acid sequence near the C
terminus. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL)
cells revealed a punctate nuclear distribution. In day-16.5 mouse
embryos, Fop protein was expressed in heart, lung, gut, kidney,
submandibular gland, thymus, follicles of the vibrissae, muscle, brown
fat, and neuronal cells of brain, olfactory epithelium, and dorsal root
ganglia. Fop tightly associated with facultative heterochromatin in MEL
cells. Time-lapse imaging showed that fluorescence-tagged Fop released
from condensed chromosomes during mitosis and relocalized to chromatin
after cell division.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mutation analysis, Zullo et al. (2009) showed that the N-terminal
40 amino acids of full-length SRAG functioned as a nucleolar exclusion
signal. Treatment with an RNase or disruption of nucleolar ribosomal RNA
reduced nucleolar SRAG localization, suggesting that nucleolar SRAG
depends upon RNA. Srag protein expression was reduced following
activation of mouse thymocytes and during the G2/M phase of the cell
cycle in HeLa cells. Overexpression of SRAG in HeLa cells slowed cell
growth by reducing entry into the G2/M phase and by enhancing cell
death.

Using fetal mouse liver cells expressing the entire human beta-globin
cluster (see HBB; 141900), van Dijk et al. (2010) found that knockdown
of Fop via lentivirus infection upregulated the expression of human
fetal gamma-globin (see HBG1; 142200) within the beta-globin cluster, in
addition to upregulating expression of the embryonic mouse beta-globin
genes, epsilon-Y and beta-H1. Silencing of Fop did not alter expression
of the adult mouse globin genes beta-major and alpha-globin (see HBA1;
141800). Depletion of FOP from adult human erythroid progenitor cells
increased expression of embryonic epsilon-globin (HBE1; 142100) and
gamma-globin and decreased expression of adult beta-globin mRNA. The
embryonic zeta-globin gene (HBZ; 142310) within the alpha-globin cluster
was also reactivated following FOP depletion. FOP appeared to modulate
SOX6 (607257)-dependent silencing of gamma-globin in the adult erythroid
progenitor cells. Van Dijk et al. (2010) concluded that FOP is a
critical regulator of fetal globin gene expression.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, van Dijk et al.
(2010) found that mouse Fop interacted with the methyltransferase Prmt1
(602950). The GAR domain of Fop was heavily methylated by Prmt1 and
Prmt5 (604045) in vitro and in vivo, and both methyltransferases
competed for Fop binding. Knockdown of FOP in estrogen-responsive MCF7
human breast cancer cells via small interfering RNA almost completely
blocked estrogen-induced promoter occupancy by ER-alpha (ESR1; 133430)
and reduced expression of the estrogen-responsive genes PS2 (TFF1;
113710), lactoferrin (LTF; 150210), and TGF-alpha (TGFA; 190170).

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the CHTOP gene to chromosome 1q21.3 based on an
alignment of the CHTOP sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL050260) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zullo et al. (2009) found that Srag knockout in mice was embryonic
lethal and incompatible with viability in mouse embryonic fibroblasts
and stem cells.

;;SPFH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; SPFH2;;
CHROMOSOME 8 OPEN READING FRAME 2; C8ORF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, followed by PCR and RACE of adult and
fetal cDNA libraries, Ikegawa et al. (1999) cloned 2 splice variants of
ERLIN2, which they designated C8ORF2. The deduced 339- and 152-amino
acid proteins share the first 141 N-terminal amino acids, then diverge.
Both proteins have an N-glycosylation site and type-2 membrane topology,
and the longer protein has a lysine- and glutamic acid-rich region.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of 1.6- and 2.5-kb
transcripts; a minor 4.4-kb transcript was also observed.

Using monoclonal antibodies to human lipid raft proteins, Browman et al.
(2006) identified ERLIN1 (611604) and ERLIN2 as components of lipid
rafts. Immunohistochemical analysis of endogenous and
fluorescence-tagged proteins revealed that ERLIN1 and ERLIN2 localized
specifically to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope. The
2 proteins share 83% identity, and both contain a conserved prohibitin
(PHB; 176705) homology domain of about 160 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway removes aberrant proteins
and metabolically regulated native proteins from the ER. Pearce et al.
(2007) found that SPFH2 associated rapidly with activated IP3 receptors
(see IP3R1; 147265), which are substrates for the ERAD pathway, in
various mammalian cell lines. A proportion of SPFH2 associated with
several components of the ERAD pathway, and RNA interference-mediated
depletion of SPFH2 inhibited polyubiquitination and degradation of IP3R1
and turnover of model ERAD substrates. Pearce et al. (2007) concluded
that SPFH2 is a key ERAD pathway component that may act as a substrate
recognition factor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikegawa et al. (1999) determined that the ERLIN2 gene contains 16 exons
and spans more than 16.5 kb. The first 4 exons encode alternative
5-prime UTRs, exon 5 contains the initiating methionine, and exons 10
and 16 encode alternative 3-prime UTRs.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ikegawa et al. (1999) mapped the ERLIN2
gene to chromosome 8p11.2.

CYTOGENETICS

By autozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing in a
consanguineous Saudi family with complicated SPG18 (611225), Alazami et
al. (2011) identified a homozygous 20-kb deletion on chromosome 8, with
the distal breakpoint near physical position 37,694,857 (NCBI36) and the
proximal breakpoint near 37,714,575 immediately upstream of exon 2 of
the ERLIN2 gene. This 20-kb interval spans 2 protein-coding genes,
ERLIN2 and FLJ34378. RT-PCR analysis of patient lymphoblasts showed loss
of ERLIN2 transcription, consistent with a null allele. Alazami et al.
(2011) noted that ERLIN2 is involved in the endoplasmic
reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, and postulated that
loss of ERLIN2 may result in persistent activation of IP3 signaling and
neuronal channel activity since ERAD normally degrades IP3 receptors.
Alazami et al. (2011) concluded that ERLIN2 depletion caused the
phenotype, although they could not exclude a role for FLJ34378.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive spastic paraplegia-18 (SPG18; 611225), Yildirim et al. (2011)
identified a truncation mutation in the ERLIN2 gene (611605.0001) by
linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing. The authors
termed the disorder 'intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and
contractures (IDMDC).' Affected individuals presented between ages 6
months and 2 years with an arrest and regression of motor function. They
developed progressive severe contractures of all joints, resulting in
severe motor disability and a fixed position. All had severe
intellectual disability, and none could speak, read, or write. Features
suggestive of spasticity included hyperactive reflexes, ankle clonus,
and extensor plantar responses, but the neurologic examination was
difficult to perform in most. Electron microscopy of white blood cells
from 2 affected sibs showed large membrane-bound vacuoles containing
flocculent material in 7 to 10% of cells, and these vacuoles appeared to
be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, and contractures,
or spastic paraplegia-18 (SPG18; 611225), Yildirim et al. (2011)
identified a 2-bp insertion (812insAC) in exon 11 of the ERLIN2 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination in the
oligomerization domain. The protein was predicted to be truncated by
20%, but the mutant transcript did not appear to undergo
nonsense-mediated decay. The mutation was not found in 109 control
individuals.

;;EPH- AND ELK-RELATED KINASE; EEK;;
PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE EEK;;
HEK3
DESCRIPTION See EPH (EPHA1; 179610) for background on Eph receptors and their
ligands, the ephrins. Chan and Watt (1991) identified human and rat DNAs
encoding 2 novel members of the EPH subclass of putative receptor
protein-tyrosine kinases. Rat cDNA clones encoding EEK (EPH- and
ELK-related kinase) were isolated from a brain cDNA library probed with
DNA encoding the kinase region of the insulin receptor-related receptor
(INSRR; 147671). The EEK protein was predicted to contain all the amino
acid residues conserved in the catalytic domains of protein-tyrosine
kinases and was most similar to 2 putative receptor protein-tyrosine
kinases of the EPH subclass, ELK (EPHB1; 600600) and EPH, showing 69 and
57% identity, respectively. Human genomic DNAs, encoding part of EEK as
well as another putative protein tyrosine kinase most similar to ELK
(90%) and symbolized ERK (EPHB2; 600997) for ELK-related kinase, were
isolated and partially characterized. The novel identity of these 2
EPH-family genes was further supported by Southern blot analysis and
localization to human chromosome 1. In Northern blot analysis of rat
RNA, DNAs encoding rat EEK and human ERK hybridized to transcripts most
abundant in brain and lung, respectively. These 2 new members of the EPH
subclass of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, EEK and ERK, may
therefore have tissue-specific functions distinct from those of the
other EPH family members.

ANIMAL MODEL

Park et al. (1997) generated mice homozygous for a mutation that
disrupts the gene encoding EPHA8, a member of the Eph family of tyrosine
proteinase receptors. EphA8 -/- mice developed to term, were fertile,
and did not display obvious anatomical or physiologic defects. The mouse
EphA8 gene is expressed primarily in a rostral to caudal gradient in the
developing tectum. Axonal tracing experiments revealed that in these
mutant mice, axons from a subpopulation of tectal neurons located in the
superficial layers of the superior colliculus did not reach targets
located in the contralateral inferior colliculus. Moreover, EphA8-null
animals displayed an aberrant ipsilateral axonal tract that projected to
the ventral region of the cervical spinal cord. Retrograde labeling
revealed that these abnormal projections originated from a small
subpopulation of superior colliculus neurons that normally express the
EPHA8 gene. Park et al. (1997) suggested that EPHA8 receptors play a
role in axonal pathfinding during development of the mammalian nervous
system.

612962	TITLE *612962 DYNACTIN 5; DCTN5
;;p25
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dynactin (see 601143) is a multimeric protein essential for
minus-end-directed transport driven by the microtubule-based motor
dynein (see DYNC1H1; 600112). DCTN5 is a subunit of the pointed-end
subcomplex of dynactin that is thought to interact with membranous cargo
(Parisi et al., 2004).

CLONING

Eckley et al. (1999) identified Dctn5, which they called p25, as a
component of the pointed-end dynactin subcomplex in bovine brain. By
database analysis, they identified mouse p25, which encodes a 182-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 20.1 kD. Eckley et al.
(1999) also identified p25 orthologs in fly and worm.

By searching databases for proteins containing an isoleucine-patch motif
predicted to adopt a left-handed parallel beta-helix fold, Parisi et al.
(2004) identified mouse p25.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the DCTN5 gene to chromosome 16p12.2 based on an
alignment of the DCTN5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK027387) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607047	TITLE *607047 ATAXIN 3; ATXN3
;;AT3;;
MJD GENE; MJD1;;
SCA3 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATXN3 has deubiquitinase activity and appears to be a component of the
ubiquitin proteasome system. It may also have roles in transcriptional
regulation and neuroprotection (summary by Haacke et al., 2006).

CLONING

To identify the gene affected by CAG expansion in Machado-Joseph disease
(MJD; 109150), Kawaguchi et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA with a CAG repeat
from a human brain cDNA library using an oligonucleotide probe with 13
CTG repeats, complementary to the CAG repeats. The cDNA, which they
designated MJD1, encodes a deduced 359-amino acid protein.

Goto et al. (1997) obtained 3 ATXN3 cDNAs from a human brain cDNA
library. Two of the cDNAs represent an ATXN3 variant that differs from
the cDNA reported by Kawaguchi et al. (1994) in splicing of the 3-prime
exons, resulting in a different C-terminal sequence in the protein. The
third cDNA has a stop codon polymorphism that results in additional
C-terminal amino acids. The deduced ATXN3 proteins, which range in size
from 360 to 374 amino acids, differ only at their C termini and in the
number of glutamines in the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract.

Schmitt et al. (1997) isolated rat Atxn3. They found that the rat and
human ATXN3 genes are highly homologous, with an overall sequence
identity of approximately 88%. However, the C-terminal end of the
putative rat protein differs strongly from the human sequence published
by Kawaguchi et al. (1994). The (CAG)n block in the rat cDNA consists of
only 3 interrupted units, suggesting that a long polyQ stretch is not
essential for normal function of the Atxn3 protein in rodents.
Transcription of rat Atxn3 was detected in most rat tissues, including
brain. In human brain sections, Schmitt et al. (1997) did not find
significantly higher ATXN3 mRNA levels in regions predominantly affected
in MJD, suggesting that additional molecules and/or regulatory events
are necessary to explain the exclusive degeneration of certain brain
areas in MJD.

Using immunohistochemistry of normal and MJD brain, Paulson et al.
(1997) showed that expression of ATXN3 was restricted to a limited
subset of neurons, particularly to those in the striatum. In normal and
diseased brain and in transfected cells, immunolocalization studies
revealed that ATXN3 was predominantly a cytoplasmic protein that
localized to neuronal processes as well.

Tait et al. (1998) studied the subcellular localization of full-length
ataxin-3 protein with a glutamine sequence in the normal range in 2
mammalian cell lines. By immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning
microscopy, and by biochemical subcellular fractionations, they detected
the protein predominantly, but not exclusively, in the nucleus. The
ataxin-3 present in the nucleus of neuroblastoma cells associated with
the inner nuclear matrix. The authors concluded that the ataxin-3
protein, which contains a putative nuclear localization signal very
close to the glutamine tract, per se has the ability to be transported
into the nucleus and that an expanded glutamine repeat is not essential
for this transport.

Using Northern blot analysis, Ichikawa et al. (2001) showed that ATXN3
mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. They detected at least
4 ATXN3 transcripts of 1.4, 1.8, 4.5, and 7.5 kb and suggested that the
different mRNA species probably result from differential splicing and
polyadenylation.

Burnett et al. (2003) stated that the major human AT3 isoform contains
an N-terminal deubiquitinating domain, called the Josephin domain,
followed by 2 ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) and a polyQ tract near
the C terminus. In some isoforms, the polyQ tract is followed by a third
UIM. Burnett et al. (2003) identified a catalytic triad of cys14,
his119, and asn134 and other highly conserved residues within the
Josephin domain of AT3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ichikawa et al. (2001) determined that the ATXN3 gene spans 48,240 bp
and contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Kawaguchi et al. (1994) mapped the ATXN3 gene to chromosome
14q32.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a 2-hybrid system, Wang et al. (2000) found that ataxin-3
interacted with 2 human homologs of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23,
HHR23A (RAD23A; 600061) and HHR23B (RAD23B; 600062). Both normal and
mutant ataxin-3 proteins interacted with the ubiquitin-like domain at
the N terminus of the HHR23 proteins, which is a motif important for
nucleotide excision repair. However, in HEK 293 cells, HHR23A was
recruited to intranuclear inclusions formed by the mutant ataxin-3 (see
MOLECULAR GENETICS) through its interaction with ataxin-3. The authors
suggested that this interaction may be associated with the normal
function of ataxin-3, and that some functional abnormality of the HHR23
proteins may exist in MJD.

By combining profile-based sequence analysis with genomewide functional
data in model organisms, Scheel et al. (2003) determined that ataxin-3
belongs to a novel group of cysteine proteases and is predicted to be
active against ubiquitin chains or related substrates. The catalytic
site of this enzyme class is similar to that found in UBP (see USP1;
603478)- and UCH (see UCHL3; 603090)-type ubiquitin proteases. They
suggested the finding had implications for disease pathogenesis by
providing a direct connection between SCA3 and ubiquitin metabolism.

Doss-Pepe et al. (2003) showed that both normal and polyQ-expanded human
ATXN3 associated with a number of proteasome subunits and with
ubiquitinated proteins. Truncation analysis showed that the UIMs of
ATXN3 bound polyubiquitin, but other factors in the full-length protein
increased the affinity of ATXN3 for polyubiquitin. Both normal and
polyQ-expanded ATXN3 inhibited formation of ubiquitin-conjugated histone
H2B (see 609904).

Burnett et al. (2003) showed that the UIM domain of AT3 bound ubiquitin
chains containing 4 or more ubiquitin units, the chain length required
for proteasome degradation. PolyQ-expanded AT3 showed similar binding to
ubiquitin chains. Both wildtype and pathologic AT3 also decreased the
degree of polyubiquitination of the test protein, iodinated lysosome,
suggesting that AT3 is a ubiquitin protease. AT3 was sensitive to a
specific ubiquitin protease inhibitor. Mutation of cys14 within the
Josephin domain to alanine reduced the ability of AT3 to remove
polyubiquitin chains from iodinated lysosome.

Winborn et al. (2008) showed that human ATXN3 bound both lys48- and
lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, but preferentially cleaved lys63
linkages. ATXN3 showed greater activity toward mixed-linkage
polyubiquitin, cleaving lys63 linkages in chains that contained both
lys48 and lys63 linkages. PolyQ expansion did not alter the binding or
catalytic properties of ATXN3. The authors concluded that ATXN3 is a
mixed-linkage, chain-editing enzyme and that the UIM region of ATXN3
regulates its substrate specificity.

Mueller et al. (2009) showed that protein casein kinase-2 (CK2, see
115440)-dependent phosphorylation controlled the nuclear localization,
aggregation, and stability of ataxin-3. Ser340 and ser352 within the
third ubiquitin-interacting motif of ATXN3 were particularly important
for nuclear localization of normal and expanded ATXN3, and mutation of
these sites robustly reduced the formation of nuclear inclusions. A
putative nuclear leader sequence was not required. ATXN3 associated with
CK2-alpha (CSNK2A1; 115440), and pharmacologic inhibition of CK2
decreased nuclear ATXN3 levels and the formation of nuclear inclusions.
ATXN3 shifted to the nucleus upon thermal stress in a CK2-dependent
manner, suggesting a key role of CK2-mediated phosphorylation of ATXN3
in SCA3 pathophysiology.

Reina et al. (2010) showed that interactions of ATXN3 with
valosin-containing protein (VCP; 601023) and HHR23B were dynamic and
modulated by proteotoxic stresses. Heat shock, a general proteotoxic
stress, also induced wildtype and pathogenic ATXN3 to accumulate in the
nucleus. Mapping studies showed that 2 regions of ATXN3, the Josephin
domain and the C terminus, regulated heat shock-induced nuclear
localization. Atxn3-null mouse cells were more sensitive to toxic
effects of heat shock, suggesting that ATXN3 had a protective function
in the cellular response to heat shock. Oxidative stress also induced
nuclear localization of ATXN3; both wildtype and pathogenic ATXN3
accumulated in the nucleus of SCA3 patient fibroblasts following
oxidative stress. Heat shock and oxidative stress were the first
processes identified that increased nuclear localization of ATXN3. Reina
et al. (2010) suggested that the nucleus may be a key site for early
pathogenesis of SCA3.

Koch et al. (2011) showed that L-glutamate-induced excitation of
patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons
initiates calcium-dependent proteolysis of ATXN3 followed by the
formation of SDS-insoluble aggregates. This phenotype could be abolished
by calpain (see 114220) inhibition, confirming a key role of this
protease in ATXN3 aggregation. Aggregate formation was further dependent
on functional sodium and potassium channels as well as ionotropic and
voltage-gated calcium channels, and was not observed in iPSCs,
fibroblasts, or glia, thereby providing an explanation for the
neuron-specific phenotype of Machado-Joseph disease. Koch et al. (2011)
concluded that iPSCs enable the study of aberrant protein processing
associated with late-onset neurodegenerative disorders in
patient-specific neurons.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down studies, Araujo
et al. (2011) found that endogenous ATXN3 interacted directly with the
transcription factor FOXO4 (300033) in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells,
rat CSM14.1 mesencephalic cells, and mouse brain. The interaction
required the N-terminal Josephin domain of ATXN3. Expression of ATXN3
enhanced FOXO4-dependent expression of the antioxidant enzyme SOD2
(147460) in a manner independent of ATXN3 deubiquitinase activity.
Treatment of HeLa cells with H2O2 induced nuclear translocation of FOXO4
and ATXN3, enhanced binding of FOXO4 and ATXN3 to the SOD2 promoter, and
induced SOD2 expression. Coexpression of mutant ATXN3 with an expanded
polyglutamine tract or knockdown of ATXN3 via short hairpin RNA reduced
FOXO4 nuclear translocation and induction of SOD2. Lymphocytes from SCA3
patients exposed to oxidative stress showed reduced binding of FOXO4 to
the SOD2 promoter, concomitant with impaired upregulation of SOD2 and
enhanced oxidative cytotoxicity. Araujo et al. (2011) concluded that
ATXN3 stabilizes FOXO4 and acts as a transcriptional coactivator with
FOXO4 in the oxidative stress response.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- CAG Expansion in ATXN3 in Machado-Joseph Disease

In 8 of 9 patients with clinically diagnosed MJD, Kawaguchi et al.
(1994) identified CAG expansions of between 68 to 79 in the ATXN3 gene
(607047.0001). In normal individuals, the ATXN3 gene was found to
contain between 13 and 36 CAG repeats.

Kawaguchi et al. (1994) found a negative correlation between age of
onset and CAG repeat numbers. Southern blot analyses and genomic cloning
demonstrated the existence of related genes and raised the possibility
that similar abnormalities in related genes may give rise to diseases
similar to MJD.

- Pathogenic Effects of Polyglutamine Expansion in ATXN3

Paulson et al. (1997) showed that ATXN3 with a polyglutamine sequence in
the pathologic range accumulated in ubiquitinated intranuclear
inclusions selectively in neurons of affected brain regions. They
provided evidence in vitro for a model of disease in which an expanded
polyglutamine-containing fragment recruits full-length protein into
insoluble aggregates.

Evert et al. (1999) generated ataxin-3-expressing rat mesencephalic
CSM14.1 cells to study the effects of long-term expression of ataxin-3.
The isolated stable cell lines provided high level expression of human
full-length ataxin-3 with either the normal nonexpanded CAG repeats
(SCA3-Q23) or the pathogenic expanded CAG repeats (SCA3-Q70). When
cultured at a nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C), CSM14.1 cells
expressing the expanded full-length ataxin-3 developed nuclear inclusion
bodies, strong indentations of the nuclear envelope, and cytoplasmic
vacuolation, whereas cells expressing the nonexpanded form and control
cells did not. The ultrastructural alterations resembled those found in
affected neurons of SCA3 patients. Cells with such changes exhibited
increased spontaneous nonapoptotic cell death.

Gaspar et al. (2000) explored the possibility that frameshift mutations
in expanded CAG tracts of ATXN3 can generate polyalanine mutant proteins
and form intranuclear inclusions. Antisera were raised against a
synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of ATXN3, which would
result from a frameshift within the CAG repeat motif with an intervening
polyalanine stretch. Corresponding proteins were evident in MJD patients
by Western blot analysis of lymphoblastoid proteins and in situ
hybridization of MJD pontine neurons. Transfection experiments suggested
that frameshifts are more likely to occur in longer CAG repeats and that
alanine polymers alone may be harmful to cells. The authors suggested
that a similar pathogenic mechanism may occur in other CAG repeat
disorders.

Toulouse et al. (2005) established a cellular model of transcript
frameshifting of expanded CAG tracts, resulting from ribosomal slippage
to the -1 frame exclusively. Ribosomal frameshifting depended on the
presence of long CAG tracts, and polyalanine-frameshifted proteins may
enhance polyglutamine-associated toxicity, possibly contributing to
pathogenesis. Anisomycin, a ribosome-interacting drug that reduces -1
frameshifting, also reduced toxicity, suggesting a therapeutic
opportunity for these disorders.

Haacke et al. (2006) found that full-length recombinant human AT3 formed
detergent-resistant fibrillar aggregates in vitro with extremely low
efficiency, even when it contained a pathogenic polyQ tract of 71
residues (AT3Q71). However, an N-terminally truncated form, called
257cQ71, which began with residue 257 and contained only the C terminus
with an expanded polyQ region, readily formed detergent-insoluble
aggregates and recruited full-length nonpathogenic AT3Q22 into the
aggregates. The efficiency of recruitment increased with expansion of
the polyQ stretch. FRET analysis revealed that the interaction of AT3Q22
with the polyQ tract of 257cQ71 caused a conformational change that
affected the active-site cysteine within the Josephin domain of AT3Q22.
Similar results were found in vivo with transfected mouse neuroblastoma
cells: 257cQ71 formed inclusions in almost all cells, and full-length
AT3 proteins did not readily aggregate unless coexpressed with 257cQ71.
AT3Q71 also formed inclusions, but it appeared to do so following its
partial degradation. Use of an engineered protease-sensitive form of AT3
suggested that release of expanded polyQ fragments initiates the
formation of cellular inclusions. Haacke et al. (2006) concluded that
recruitment of functional AT3 into aggregates by expanded
polyQ-containing fragments reduces cellular AT3 content and thus impairs
its function.

- Suppression of Mutant ATXN3

In animal cell models, Miller et al. (2003) demonstrated that
allele-specific silencing of disease genes with small interfering RNA
(siRNA) could be achieved by targeting either a linked SNP or the
disease mutation directly. They determined that selective targeting of
the disease-causing CAG repeat in the ATXN3 gene was not possible and
then took advantage of an associated SNP to generate siRNA that
exclusively silenced the mutant ATXN3 allele while sparing expression of
the wildtype allele. Allele-specific suppression was accomplished with
all 3 siRNA delivery approaches in use at the time: in vitro-synthesized
duplexes and plasmid and viral expression of short hairpin RNA.

In vitro, Li et al. (2004) found that an siRNA targeted to a C/G
polymorphism immediately after the CAG repeat that is expanded in MJD
effectively suppressed expression of mutant ataxin-3 (79 repeats) by 96%
without significant effect on the wildtype protein. In addition, siRNA
decreased cell death by 63 to 76%.

- Susceptibility to Late-Onset Parkinson Disease

In a family of African descent in which 3 members presented with
phenotypic features reminiscent of typical Parkinson disease (168600),
Gwinn-Hardy et al. (2001) identified pathogenic expansions in the ATXN3
gene. Features suggestive of PD included bradykinesis, facial masking,
rigidity, postural instability, shuffling, asymmetric onset, dopamine
responsiveness, and lack of atypical features often associated with
SCA3. A fourth, mildly symptomatic patient also carried the repeat
expansion. The authors suggested that the low numbers of repeats in this
family (67-75; normal, 16-34) presenting with parkinsonism may be
associated with ethnic background and that evaluation for SCA3 should be
considered in similar cases.

EVOLUTION

By comparing wildtype haplotypes encompassing the ATXN3 CAG repeat in
431 chromosomes of European, Asian, and African origin, Martins et al.
(2006) concluded that the main mutation mechanism occurring in the
evolution of the polymorphic CAG repeat is a multistep process resulting
from gene conversion or DNA slippage, as opposed to a stepwise process.
The 4 most frequent haplotypes showed a bimodal CAG repeat length
frequency distribution, particularly in the European population, and
genetic distances among all the alleles from each population did not
reflect allele size differences.

ANIMAL MODEL

- Transgenic Rodent Models of Machado-Joseph Disease

Cemal et al. (2002) generated transgenic mice by introducing pathologic
ATXN3 alleles with polyglutamine tract lengths of 64, 67, 72, 76, and 84
repeats, as well as the wildtype with 15 repeats. The mice with expanded
alleles demonstrated a mild and slowly progressive cerebellar deficit,
manifesting as early as 4 weeks of age. As the disease progressed,
pelvic elevation became markedly flattened and was accompanied by
hypotonia and motor and sensory loss. Neuronal intranuclear inclusion
formation and cell loss was prominent in the pontine and dentate nuclei,
with variable cell loss in other regions of the cerebellum from 4 weeks
of age. Peripheral nerve demyelination and axonal loss was also detected
in symptomatic mice from 26 weeks of age. In contrast, transgenic mice
carrying the wildtype (CAG)15 allele of the ATXN3 locus appeared
completely normal at 20 months. Disease severity increased with the
level of expression of the expanded protein and the size of the repeat.

Boy et al. (2009) generated a conditional mouse model of SCA3.
Transgenic mice developed a progressive neurologic phenotype
characterized by neuronal dysfunction in the cerebellum, reduced
anxiety, hyperactivity, impaired performance on the rotarod test, and
lower body weight gain. When mutant ataxin-3 expression was turned off
in symptomatic mice in an early disease state, the transgenic mice were
indistinguishable from negative controls after 5 months of treatment.
Boy et al. (2009) concluded that reducing the production of pathogenic
ataxin-3 may be a promising approach to treat SCA3, provided that such
treatment is applied before irreversible damage has taken place and that
it is continued for a sufficiently long time.

Alves et al. (2010) both overexpressed and silenced wildtype ATX3 in the
rat model of MJD developed by Alves et al. (2008). They found that
overexpression of wildtype ATX3 did not protect against MJD pathology,
that knockdown of wildtype ATX3 did not aggravate MJD pathology, and
that non-allele-specific silencing of ataxin-3 strongly reduced
neuropathology.

- Transgenic Drosophila Models of Machado-Joseph Disease

Warrick et al. (2005) expressed normal and pathogenic forms of human
ATXN3 in Drosophila and found that the normal activity of ATXN3
mitigated polyQ-induced neurodegeneration. When both normal and
pathogenic proteins were expressed together throughout the nervous
system, flies lived longer and showed improved brain cortical structure
compared with flies expressing only the pathogenic protein. Normal ATXN3
reduced accumulation of pathogenic ATXN3 and of other polyQ disease
proteins. Mutations in the ubiquitin interaction motif or in the
ubiquitin protease domain of ATXN3 abrogated the protective effect.
Protection also required proteasome activity, indicating that the normal
function of ATXN3 requires the ubiquitin pathway of protein quality
control.

Jung and Bonini (2007) showed that a transgenic Drosophila model for
spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 recapitulated key features of human CAG
repeat instability, including large repeat changes and strong expansion
bias. Instability was dramatically enhanced by transcription and
modulated by nuclear excision repair and CREB-binding protein (600140),
a histone acetyltransferase whose decreased activity contributes to
polyglutamine disease. Pharmacologic treatment normalized
acetylation-suppressed instability. Thus, Jung and Bonini (2007)
concluded that toxic consequences of pathogenic polyglutamine protein
may include enhancing repeat instability.

Li et al. (2008) provided evidence of a pathogenic role for ATXN3 CAG
repeat RNA in polyQ toxicity. In a screen for modifiers of polyQ
degeneration induced by ATXN3 in a transgenic Drosophila model, the
authors isolated an upregulation allele of muscleblind (see MBNL1;
606516), a gene implicated in the RNA toxicity of CUG expansion
diseases. Upregulation of muscleblind enhanced ATXN3 toxicity. Altering
the ATXN3 repeat sequence to an interrupted CAACAG repeat within the
polyQ-encoding region resulted in dramatically mitigated toxicity in
flies. Expressing an untranslated CAG repeat of pathogenic length in
flies resulted neuronal degeneration. Li et al. (2008) concluded that
these studies reveal a role for RNA in polyQ toxicity, highlighting
common components in RNA-based and polyQ protein-based trinucleotide
repeat expansion diseases.

To gain insight into the significance of ataxin-3 cleavage, Jung et al.
(2009) developed a Drosophila SL2 cell-based model as well as transgenic
fly models of SCA3. Ataxin-3 protein cleavage was conserved in the fly
and may be caspase-dependent as reported previously. Comparison of flies
expressing either wildtype or caspase-site mutant proteins indicated
that ataxin-3 cleavage enhanced neuronal loss in vivo.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MACHADO-JOSEPH DISEASE
PARKINSON DISEASE, LATE-ONSET, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
ATXN3, (CAG)n EXPANSION

Machado-Joseph disease (109150), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia-3,
results from an expansion of a (CAG)n repeat in the ATXN3 gene. In
normal individuals, the gene contains between 13 and 36 CAG repeats,
whereas most patients with clinically diagnosed MJD and all of the
affected members of a family with clinical and pathologic MJD showed
expansion of the repeat number in the range of 68 to 79 copies
(Kawaguchi et al., 1994).

Susceptibility to Late-Onset Parkinson Disease

In a family of African descent in which 3 members presented with
phenotypic features reminiscent of typical Parkinson disease (168600),
Gwinn-Hardy et al. (2001) identified pathogenic expansions in the ATXN3
gene. Features suggestive of PD included bradykinesis, facial masking,
rigidity, postural instability, shuffling, asymmetric onset, dopamine
responsiveness, and lack of atypical features often associated with
SCA3. A fourth, mildly symptomatic patient also carried the repeat
expansion. The authors suggested that the low numbers of repeats in this
family (67-75; normal, 16-34) presenting with parkinsonism may be
associated with ethnic background and that evaluation for SCA3 should be
considered in similar cases.

600327	TITLE *600327 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 3; SYT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Synaptotagmin-1 (SYT1; 185605), an integral membrane protein of synaptic
vesicles, is thought to be involved in calcium-dependent exocytosis of
synaptic vesicles. Mizuta et al. (1994) cloned a novel isoform of
synaptotagmin, designated synaptotagmin-3, from a rat brain cDNA library
and studied its tissue distribution. The protein contains 588 amino
acids having 40.5, 38.3, and 64.0% identity with rat synaptotagmin-1,
rat synaptotagmin-2 (SYT2; 600104), and a third synaptotagmin isoform of
the marine ray, respectively. The region of the 2 internal repeats
homologous to the regulatory domain of protein kinase C was highly
conserved among the 3 synaptotagmins. RNA blot studies demonstrated that
synaptotagmin-3 mRNA is expressed in brain, various endocrine tissues,
and hormone-secreting clonal cells. It appeared to be involved in
Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of secretory vesicles in endocrine cells, as
well as in neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro characterization of recombinant rat Syt3, Li et al. (1995)
determined that Syt3 showed Ca(2+)-dependent binding to phospholipids,
Ca(2+)-dependent binding to syntaxins (see 186590), and
Ca(2+)-independent binding to adaptor protein-2 (see 601026).

MAPPING

Using an interspecific backcross DNA panel, Jones et al. (1995)
demonstrated that the mouse Syt3 gene is located on mouse chromosome 7;
no recombinants were observed between Syt3 and the kallikrein gene
family (Kal) in 94 meioses. To map human SYT3, they probed a Southern
blot containing genomic DNAs from a somatic cell mapping panel and found
segregation with chromosome 19. Thus, SYT3 appears to be located in the
conserved linkage group on proximal mouse chromosome 7 and human
chromosome 19q that is known to include at least 28 genes (Holdener et
al., 1993). Kwon et al. (1995) likewise mapped Syt3 to mouse chromosome
7.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PLPLA2 is a triglyceride lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) that localizes to lipid
droplets and catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride hydrolysis
(Zimmermann et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching for genes expressed exclusively in mouse adipose tissue,
Villena et al. (2004) cloned Pnpla2, which they designated desnutrin.
The deduced 486-amino acid protein contains a highly conserved 180-amino
acid N-terminal patatin domain with a glycine-rich region, an active
serine hydrolase motif, and an aspartate active site motif. By database
analysis, Villena et al. (2004) identified human PNPLA2, which shows 88%
amino acid homology to mouse desnutrin. Northern blot analysis detected
a 2.0-kb transcript expressed at high levels in mouse brown and white
adipose tissue and at intermediate levels in heart and testis. Very low
expression was detected in all other mouse tissues examined. Expression
of desnutrin was lower in gonadal fat deposits of genetically obese mice
compared with wildtype mice. Desnutrin mRNA was found only in mature
adipocytes and not in proliferating or confluent mouse preadipocytes.
Expression was rapidly increased in cells induced to differentiate.

GENE FUNCTION

Villena et al. (2004) found that desnutrin mRNA levels were regulated by
the nutritional status of mice, being transiently induced during
fasting. In vitro desnutrin gene expression was upregulated by
dexamethasone in a dose-dependent manner, but not by cAMP, suggesting
that glucocorticoids could mediate the increased desnutrin mRNA levels
observed during fasting.

Zimmermann et al. (2004) reported that an enzyme besides
hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; 151750) that they called 'adipose
triglyceride lipase (ATGL)' catalyzes the initial step in triglyceride
hydrolysis in mammalian adipose tissue. ATGL contains a 'patatin domain'
common to plant acyl-hydrolases. ATGL is highly expressed in adipose
tissue of mice and humans. It exhibits high substrate specificity for
triacylglycerol and is associated with lipid droplets. Inhibition of
ATGL markedly decreased total adipose acyl-hydrolase activity. Thus,
Zimmermann et al. (2004) concluded that ATGL and hormone-sensitive
lipase coordinately catabolize stored triglycerides in adipose tissue of
mammals.

Jenkins et al. (2004) found that purified recombinant PNPLA3 (609567),
PNPLA2, and GS2 (PNPLA4; 300102) expressed in insect cells showed
abundant triacylglycerol lipase activity. The recombinant enzymes also
showed acylglycerol transacylase activity by transferring the acyl donor
mono-olein to mono-olein or diolein acceptors to form diolein and
triolein, respectively.

Using a cell culture model and various biochemical approaches, Wang et
al. (2011) investigated the mechanisms by which perilipin-1 (PLIN1;
170290), PLIN2 (103195), and PLIN5 (613248) control lipolysis by ATGL
and its colipase, CGI58 (ABHD5; 604780). PLIN5 exerted a negative
regulatory role in lipid droplet hydrolysis by binding and inhibiting
ATGL activity at the lipid droplet surface under basal conditions. Even
after protein kinase A (PKA; see 188830) activation, release of fatty
acid was only modestly increased. In contrast, recruitment of CGI58,
followed by interaction with ATGL, increased lipolysis. Neither PLIN1
nor PLIN2 directly interacted with ATGL. Wang et al. (2011) proposed
that PLIN5 plays a critical role in oxidative tissues (e.g., heart and
skeletal muscle) to protect mitochondria from a rapid increase of fatty
acid during lipolysis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fischer et al. (2007) reported that the PNPLA2 gene comprises 9 coding
exons.

MAPPING

The Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PNPLA2 gene to
chromosome 11 (TMAP A009K14). Villena et al. (2004) mapped the mouse
Pnpla2 gene to chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 patients with a neutral lipids storage disorder (NLSD) associated
with mild myopathy but not ichthyosis (NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al.
(2007) detected mutations in the PNPLA2 gene. One individual was a
compound heterozygote for a 1-bp deletion (808delC; 609059.0001) and a
missense mutation (P195L; 609059.0002). The second was homozygous for a
1-bp deletion (847delC; 609059.0003). The third was homozygous for a
nonsense mutation (Q289X; 609059.0004). Fischer et al. (2007) considered
the PNPLA2 gene as a good candidate for mutations causing this disorder
because PNPLA2 is activated by ABHD5 (604780), mutations in which cause
another NLSD, that with ichthyosis (NLSDI), also called Chanarin-Dorfman
syndrome (CDS; 275630). Fischer et al. (2007) noted that the 808delC,
847delC, and Q289X mutations severely alter and delete the C-terminal
region of the protein, which includes the putative lipid-binding site.
They suggested that loss of the C-terminal region could explain the low
activity of the lipid droplet-associated lipase and the defect in
triglyceride catabolism, while the intact N-terminal region containing
the catalytic site may retain lipase activity, explaining the normal in
vitro lipase activity in whole lysate of fibroblasts.

Reilich et al. (2011) identified biallelic mutations in the PNPLA2 gene
(see, e.g., 609059.0002; 609059.0009-609059.0010) in 6 patients,
including 2 sibs, with NLSDM. Mutations in 5 of the patients resulted in
a lack of protein expression. The patients had adult onset of muscle
weakness affecting primarily the shoulder girdle but sometimes affecting
the lower limbs and distal muscles of the fingers and feet. Some
patients developed cardiac involvement later in the disease course. All
had increased serum creatine kinase, most had increased serum
triglycerides, and all had Jordans bodies on peripheral blood smear,
consistent with multisystem lipid accumulation. Other, more variable
features included diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and sensorineural hearing
loss. Activation of hormone-sensitive lipase by beta-adrenergic agents
such as clenbuterol appeared to bypass the enzymatic block in
PNPLA2-deficient patient cells in vitro, suggesting a possible
therapeutic approach.

In 3 unrelated Han Chinese patients with adult-onset neutral lipid
storage disease with myopathy, Lin et al. (2012) identified 4 different
mutations in the PNPLA2 gene (609059.0005-609059.0008). All mutations
occurred in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state.

ANIMAL MODEL

Das et al. (2011) showed that inhibition of lipolysis through genetic
ablation of Atgl or hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; 151750) ameliorated
certain features of cancer-associated cachexia. In wildtype C57BL/6
mice, the injection of Lewis lung carcinoma or B16 melanoma cells causes
tumor growth, loss of white adipose tissue, and a marked reduction of
gastrocnemius muscle. In contrast, Atgl-deficient mice with tumors
resisted increased white adipose tissue lipolysis, myocyte apoptosis,
and proteasomal muscle degradation and maintained normal adipose and
gastrocnemius muscle mass. Hsl-deficient mice with tumors were also
protected, although to a lesser degree. Das et al. (2011) concluded that
functional lipolysis is essential in the pathogenesis of
cancer-associated cachexia.

Haemmerle et al. (2011) found that Atgl knockout in mice resulted in
cardiac insufficiency and premature death. Cardiac dysfunction was
associated with excessive lipid and glycogen accumulation, disrupted
substrate oxidation and respiration in predominantly subsarcolemmal
mitochondria, reduced expression of Ppar-alpha (PPARA; 170998) and
Ppar-delta (PPARD; 600409) target genes, including genes directly
involved in fatty acid and glucose metabolism, and reduced expression of
Pgc1-alpha (PPARGC1A; 604517) and Pgc1-beta (PPARGC1B; 608886).
Atgl-null mice also showed defective expression of Ppar-alpha and
Ppar-delta target genes in liver, but decreased expression of Pgc1-alpha
and Pgc1-beta was specific to cardiac muscle. Conditional Atgl deletion
in heart and skeletal muscle only resulted in a cardiac phenotype
identical to that in Atgl -/- mice. Reexpression of an Atgl transgene in
hearts of Atgl -/- mice entirely rescued the lethal cardiac phenotype,
increased expression of Ppar-alpha and Ppar-delta target genes and
Pgc1-alpha and Pgc1-beta, restored the metabolic profile, and increased
life span to a level indistinguishable from wildtype. Treatment of Atgl
-/- mice with Ppar-alpha agonists, but not Ppar-delta agonists,
completely reversed all pathologic effects of Atgl deletion. Haemmerle
et al. (2011) concluded that ATGL is required for cardiac mitochondrial
function and activation of lipids as signaling molecules.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 808C

In a female from the Netherlands with neutral lipid storage disease with
myopathy (NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) detected compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the PNPLA2 gene. A 1-bp deletion in exon
7 (808delC) led to frameshift and a premature stop codon at amino acid
position 319. The other allele carried a missense mutation
(609059.0002).

.0002
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, PRO195LEU

The patient of Fischer et al. (2007) from the Netherlands with neutral
lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM; 610717) carried a 584C-T
transition in exon 5 of the PNPLA2 gene that led to a pro195-to-leu
substitution (P195L). This mutation is localized on the border of the
N-terminal patatin domain in a region that is conserved in 5 proteins of
the PNPLA family and in homologous genes conserved in bilateral animals.
The other allele of the patient carried a 1-bp deletion (609059.0001).

Reilich et al. (2011) reported a 45-year-old woman from Newfoundland
with NLSDM and a homozygous P195L mutation in the PNPLA2 gene. She had
onset of slowly progressive myopathy in her twenties, followed by severe
congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy by her late thirties. She
also developed diabetes mellitus. The proximal muscles were more
severely affected. Her father died of dilated cardiomyopathy at age 57.
The proband also carried a homozygous G483R substitution in the PNPLA2
gene, which was of uncertain significance.

.0003
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 847C

In a French patient with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy
(NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) detected homozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion in exon 7 of the PNPLA2 gene, 847delC, leading to frameshift
and a premature stop codon at amino acid position 319. This patient
developed diabetes at age 12 and died from cardiovascular complications
at age 34.

NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, GLN289TER

In an Algerian patient with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy
(NLSDM; 610717), Fischer et al. (2007) found homozygosity for an 865C-T
transition in exon 7 of the PNPLA2 gene that substituted a stop codon
for the glutamine at codon 289 (Q289X).

.0005
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, IVS6DS, T-C, +2

In a 44-year-old Han Chinese man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin et
al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
PNPLA2 gene: a T-to-C transition in intron 6, and a 749A-C transversion
resulting in a gln250-to-pro (Q250P; 609059.0006) substitution. RT-PCR
of patient skeletal muscle detected only the Q250P mutant mRNA,
indicating that absence of the transcript results from the splice site
mutation. The Q250P mutation was not found in 50 controls.

the PNPLA2 gene. No PNPLA2 transcript was detected by RT-PCR analysis of
mRNA from skeletal muscle.

.0008

PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 467C

In a 39-year-old Han Chinese man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Lin et
al. (2012) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (467delC) in the PNPLA2
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Pro156LeufsTer100).

.0009
NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DUP, 613C

In 2 Turkish sibs with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Reilich et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp duplication (c.613dupC) in exon 5 of the
PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutant transcript was predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
resulting in a lack of protein. Muscle weakness primarily affected the
proximal upper limbs, although both patients also had some distal
involvement, including of the lower limbs in 1. Serum creatine kinase
and triglycerides were increased. Both patients had hepatic steatosis,
but neither had cardiac involvement. Jordans bodies were present in
peripheral blood.

NEUTRAL LIPID STORAGE DISEASE WITH MYOPATHY
PNPLA2, 1-BP DEL, 543C

In a British man with adult-onset NLSDM (610717), Reilich et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (c.543delC) in exon 5 of the
PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutant transcript was predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
resulting in a lack of protein. At age 28 years, the patient developed
slowly progressive muscle weakness affecting the proximal upper and
lower limbs. At age 52 years, he had Gowers sign, distal muscle weakness
of the upper and lower extremities, and cardiac involvement. He also had
sensorineural hearing loss since childhood. Jordans bodies were present
in peripheral blood.

(2007) identified a homozygous 4-bp duplication (c.475_478dupCTCC) in
exon 4 of the PNPLA2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination in the patatin domain (Gln160ProfsTer19). The mutation was
not found in 100 control alleles or in 50 unrelated Japanese
individuals. She had delayed walking and slow running from childhood,
with severe upper and lower limb involvement as an adult. However, she
did not have cardiac involvement. Imaging showed fatty replacement of
multiple skeletal muscles, and skeletal muscle biopsy showed
accumulation of neutral lipid droplets.

609787	TITLE *609787 UBIQUITIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; UBAP1
;;UBAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening the expression patterns of ESTs located in a region at
9p22-p21 undergoing loss of heterozygosity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC), Yang et al. (1999) identified an EST that is downregulated in
NPC. Using the clone for this EST and 5-prime RACE, Qian et al. (2001)
identified the full-length cDNA sequence, which they designated UBAP1.
The deduced 502-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 55
kD and contains 2 putative tandem UBA domains at the C terminus, a
coiled-coil domain, 2 possible N-glycosylation sites, 5 PKC
phosphorylation sites, 7 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and 3
N-myristoylation sites. Qian et al. (2001) also identified mouse Ubap1.
The human and mouse proteins share 90% sequence identity. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected ubiquitous expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript, with highest expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and
liver. RT-PCR of mouse tissues also revealed ubiquitous expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using RT-PCR and direct sequencing, Qian et al. (2001) screened the NPC
cell line HNE1 and 10 primary NPCs for mutations in the UBAP1 gene. They
found no sequence alterations.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Qian et al. (2001) mapped the UBAP1 gene to
chromosome 9p22-p21.

609168	TITLE *609168 SHUGOSHIN-LIKE 1; SGOL1
;;SGO; SGO1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kitajima et al. (2004) cloned yeast Sgo1 and Sgo2, and by database
analysis, they identified 2 similar human proteins, SGOL1 and SGOL2
(612425), which they referred to as Q9BVA8 and tripin, respectively. All
Sgo-like proteins contain an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a
C-terminal basic region.

By searching for sequences similar to Xenopus Sgo, Salic et al. (2004)
identified mouse and human SGOL1, which they called SGO. The human
protein shares significant similarity with mouse and frog Sgo at the N-
and C-terminal ends.

Wang et al. (2008) noted that full-length SGO1 contains 527 amino acids.
An SGO1 splice variant lacking exon 6 encodes a 292-amino acid isoform
designated sSGO1. Using fluorescence microscopy, Wang et al. (2008)
showed that full-length SGO1 localized to kinetochores during mitosis.
In contrast, sSGO1 localized to centrosomes at interphase and to spindle
poles at mitosis, but not to kinetochores.

GENE FUNCTION

Salic et al. (2004) determined that the N terminus of mouse Sgo bound
and stabilized microtubules. Following transfection in HeLa cells,
epitope-tagged mouse Sgo localized to kinetochores between the fibrous
corona and the underlying centromeric chromatin, around the inner or
outer kinetochore plate. Endogenous HeLa cell SGOL1 was degraded by both
CDC20 (603618)- and CDH1 (603619)-activated anaphase-promoting complex
(APC), resulting in loss of SGOL1 from kinetochores during the
metaphase-to-anaphase transition. SGOL1 depletion by RNA interference
(RNAi) caused mitotic arrest with loss of sister kinetochore cohesion.
Chromosomes and their centromeres did not align to form a metaphase
plate; instead they scattered throughout the cell. SGOL1 depletion also
destabilized kinetochore microtubules. Salic et al. (2004) concluded
that SGOL1 is required for mitotic progression and chromosome
segregation and provides a link between sister centromere cohesion and
microtubule interactions at kinetochores.

Tang et al. (2004) found that depletion of BUB1 (602452) and SGO1 in
HeLa cells by RNAi caused massive missegregation of sister chromatids
that originated at centromeres. Loss of chromatid cohesion in BUB1 and
SGO1 RNAi cells did not appear to require activation of separase (see
604143), but instead triggered mitotic arrest dependent on MAD2 (601467)
and Aurora B (604970). Tang et al. (2004) determined that BUB1 maintains
the steady-state level and centromeric localization of SGO1, and they
concluded that BUB1 protects centromeric cohesion in mitosis through
SGO1.

Riedel et al. (2006) showed in both fission and budding yeast that Sgo1
recruited to centromeres a specific form of protein phosphatase-2A
(PP2A; 176915). Its inactivation caused loss of centromeric cohesin (see
RAD21; 606462) at anaphase I and random segregation of sister
centromeres at the second meiotic division. Artificial recruitment of
PP2A to chromosome arms prevented Rec8 (608193) phosphorylation and
hindered resolution of chiasmata. Riedel et al. (2006) concluded that
their data were consistent with the notion that efficient cleavage of
Rec8 requires phosphorylation of cohesin and that this is blocked by
PP2A at meiosis I centromeres.

In mitotic cells, phosphorylation of cohesin promotes its dissociation
from chromosomes, but centromeric cohesin is protected from
phosphorylation until kinetochores are properly captured by the spindle
microtubules. Kitajima et al. (2006) found that a shugoshin complex made
up of SGO1, SGO2, and a specific subtype of PP2A containing the
regulatory B56 subunit (see 601643) was required for protection of
centromeric cohesin in HeLa cells. The shugoshin-PP2A complex protected
cohesin by reversing phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit SA2 (STAG2;
300826). Both SGO1 and SGO2 bound PP2A directly, although SGO1 appeared
to bind the regulatory subunit PP2A-B56, while SGO2 appeared to bind the
core subunit PP2A-A (see 605983). Knockdown studies showed that SGO2
tethered PP2A to the centromere, whereas SGO1 had the more important
role in centromere protection and appeared to facilitate PP2A function
at centromeres.

Brar et al. (2006) showed that phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit
REC8 contributes to stepwise cohesin removal. Their data further
implicated 2 other key regulators of meiotic chromosome segregation, the
cohesin protector SGO1 and meiotic recombination in bringing about the
stepwise loss of cohesins and thus the establishment of the meiotic
chromosome segregation pattern.

Wang et al. (2008) found that SGO1 depletion via RNA interference
induced formation of multiple centrosome-like structures in mitotic HeLa
cells due to separation of paired centrioles. Sgo1 +/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts displayed split centrosomes. sSGO1 interacted with PLK1
(602098) in HeLa cells, and mutation of PLK1 phosphorylation sites in
sSGO1 (ser73 and thr146) resulted in mislocalization of sSGO1 from
mitotic spindle poles. Centriole splitting induced by SGO1 depletion or
expression of a dominant-negative mutant was suppressed by ectopic
expression of sSGO1 or by PLK1 knockdown. Wang et al. (2008) concluded
that sSGO1 plays an essential role in protecting centriole cohesion,
which is partly regulated by PLK1.

Yamagishi et al. (2008) showed that the requirement of heterochromatin
for mitotic chromosome segregation is largely replaced by forcibly
enriching cohesin at centromeres in fission yeast. However, this
enrichment of cohesin is not sufficient to replace the meiotic
requirement for heterochromatin. Yamagishi et al. (2008) found that the
heterochromatin protein Swi6 (whose human homolog is HP1, 604478)
associates directly with meiosis-specific shugoshin Sgo1, a protector of
cohesin at centromeres. A point mutation of Sgo1 (V243E), which
abolishes the interaction with Swi6, impairs the centromeric
localization and function of Sgo1. The forced centromeric localization
of Sgo1 restores proper meiotic chromosome segregation in swi6-delta
cells. Yamagishi et al. (2008) also showed that the direct link between
HP1 and shugoshin is conserved in human cells. Yamagishi et al. (2008)
suggested that the recruitment of shugoshin is the important primary
role for centromeric heterochromatin in ensuring eukaryotic chromosome
segregation.

Kawashima et al. (2010) demonstrated that BUB1 (602452) phosphorylates
the conserved ser121 of histone H2A in fission yeast S. pombe. The
h2a-SA mutant, in which all cellular H2A-S121 is replaced with alanine,
phenocopies the Bub1 kinase-dead mutant (bub1-KD) in losing the
centromeric localization of shugoshin proteins. Artificial tethering of
shugoshin to centromeres largely restores the h2a-SA or bub1-KD-related
chromatin instability defects, a function that is evolutionarily
conserved. Kawashima et al. (2010) concluded that Bub1 kinase creates a
mark for shugoshin localization and the correct partitioning of
chromosomes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2005) mapped the SGOL1 gene to chromosome 3p24.3 based on an
alignment of the SGOL1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF308299) with the
genomic sequence.
