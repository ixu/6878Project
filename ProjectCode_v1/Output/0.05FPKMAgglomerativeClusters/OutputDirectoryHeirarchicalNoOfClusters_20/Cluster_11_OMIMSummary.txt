DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chu et al. (1995) performed positional cloning of short fragment cDNA
sequences from the class I region of the human major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) using a hybridization selection approach. They isolated
full-length cDNA clones and partial genomic clones encoding a protein
with 2 domains rich in cysteine and histidine similar to those
characteristic of metal-dependent DNA-binding proteins. The predicted
protein also contains a domain thought to form a coiled-coil, possibly
to promote dimerization. A third feature of the predicted protein is a
polyglutamic acid region near the carboxyl terminus. Because of these
properties, Chu et al. (1995) named the gene product acid-finger
protein, AFP (a designation used originally for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP;
104150)). Although the biologic role of AFP was unknown, one potential
function was binding of nucleic acids. The gene was expressed in
multiple tissues and conserved among mammals. In particular, the mouse
and human coding regions were highly conserved.

MAPPING

Chu et al. (1995) identified the AFP gene within the MHC on chromosome
6. It appeared that multiple AFP-like genes existed in this region of
the MHC.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chemoattractant cytokines (chemokines) play an important role in the
recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory lesions. Interleukin-8
(146930) is predominantly a neutrophil chemoattractant, whereas monocyte
chemotactic protein-1 (MCP1, or CCL2; 158105) serves predominantly as a
monocyte and T-cell chemoattractant. Ponath et al. (1996) noted that the
striking accumulation of eosinophils in certain tissues, particularly in
response to parasitic infection and also as a result of IGE-mediated
reactions such as rhinitis and allergic asthma, suggests that there may
be factors that are chemotactic specifically for eosinophils. The
chemokine termed eotaxin was identified as the predominant eosinophil
chemoattractant in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of allergen-challenged
guinea pigs. Ponath et al. (1996) cloned a human homolog of guinea pig
eotaxin. Human eotaxin mediated the selective migration of eosinophils,
both in vitro and in vivo. Human eotaxin was found to be 61.8% and 63.2%
identical to guinea pig and mouse eotaxin, respectively. Radiolabeled
eotaxin was used to identify a high-affinity receptor on eosinophils.
This receptor also bound RANTES (187011) and monocyte chemotactic
protein-3 (CCL7; 158106). The same gene was isolated by Kitaura et al.
(1996), who showed that the recombinantly expressed protein induced a
calcium flux response in human eosinophils but not in either neutrophils
or monocytes. They showed that the response was mediated through the CC
chemokine receptor-3 (CCR3; 601268), a G protein-coupled receptor
expressed in eosinophils.

GENE FUNCTION

Eotaxin is a potent inducer of eosinophil chemotaxis leading to
eosinophil migration in vitro and accumulation in vivo. These effects
are mediated via CCR3, which is highly expressed on eosinophils,
basophils, and TH2 lymphocytes and, thus, is involved in allergic
inflammation. Ogilvie et al. (2001) showed that eotaxin also interacts
with CCR2 (601267) and CCR5 (601373) and can thus affect the responses
of monocytes, which express both receptors. In human monocytes, they
found that pretreatment with eotaxin decreased responsiveness to MCP1, a
selective ligand for CCR2, as well as to RANTES and MIP1-beta (182284),
which bind to CCR5. These and other results from the study demonstrated
that eotaxin is a CCR5 agonist and a CCR2 antagonist. The authors
suggested that eotaxin has a role in the fine-tuning of cellular
responses occurring at sites of allergic inflammation, in which both
MCP1 and eotaxin are produced.

Salcedo et al. (2001) showed that CCL11 induces CCR3-expressing
endothelial cell migration in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo, as well as
endothelial cell sprouting from aortic rings in the absence of an
eosinophil infiltrate. They suggested that CCL11 may contribute to
angiogenesis in conditions accompanied by eosinophil infiltration such
as Hodgkin lymphoma (236000), nasal polyposis, endometriosis, and
allergic diathesis.

Menzies-Gow et al. (2002) used immunohistological analysis to examined
the effects of intradermal injection of eotaxin and eotaxin-2 (CCL24;
602495), both of which act through CCR3, into human atopic and nonatopic
skin. Both chemokines produced a dose- and time-dependent local
eosinophilia of comparable intensity and an acute wheal and flare
response regardless of atopy status. Basophils and neutrophils also
accumulated at the injection sites. Menzies-Gow et al. (2002) concluded
that the eosinophilic and inflammatory cell infiltrate induced by
eotaxins is consistent with CC chemokine-induced mast cell
degranulation.

Villeda et al. (2011) used heterochronic parabiosis to demonstrate that
blood-borne factors present in the systemic milieu can inhibit or
promote adult neurogenesis in an age-dependent fashion in mice.
Accordingly, exposing a young mouse to an old systemic environment or to
plasma from old mice decreased synaptic plasticity, and impaired
contextual fear conditioning and spatial learning and memory. Villeda et
al. (2011) identified chemokines, including CCL11, the plasma levels of
which correlated with reduced neurogenesis in heterochronic parabionts
and aged mice, and the levels of which are increased in the plasma and
cerebrospinal fluid of healthy aging humans. Lastly, increasing
peripheral CCL11 chemokine levels in vivo in young mice decreased adult
neurogenesis and impaired learning and memory. Villeda et al. (2011)
concluded that the decline in neurogenesis and cognitive impairments
observed during aging can be in part attributed to changes in
blood-borne factors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hein et al. (1997) cloned SCYA11 genomic sequence, including the coding
region and 3 kb of DNA immediately 5-prime of the coding region. The
SCYA11 gene has 3 exons. The authors identified a number of consensus
regulatory elements in the 5-prime flanking region of the SCYA11 gene
that potentially regulate SCYA11 gene expression and/or mediate the
effects of antiinflammatory drugs.

MAPPING

Kitaura et al. (1996) mapped the SCYA11 gene to chromosome 17 using a
somatic cell hybrid DNA panel. By FISH, Garcia-Zepeda et al. (1997)
mapped the SCYA11 gene to 17q21.1-q21.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The eotaxin gene family (eotaxin 1; eotaxin 2; and eotaxin 3, 604697)
recruits and activates CCR3-bearing cells such as eosinophils, mast
cells, and Th2 lymphocytes that play a major role in allergic disorders.
Shin et al. (2003) genotyped a 721-member asthma (600807) cohort at 17
polymorphisms among the 3 eotaxin loci. Statistical analysis revealed
that the eotaxin 2 +1272A-G G* allele showed significantly lower
frequency in asthmatics than in normal healthy controls (0.14 vs 0.23, P
= 0.002), and that distribution of the eotaxin 2 +1272A-G G*
allele-containing genotypes was also much lower in asthmatics (26.3 vs
40.8%, P = 0.003). In addition, a nonsynonymous SNP in eotaxin 1,
+123Ala to Thr, showed significant association with total serum IgE
levels (P = 0.002-0.02) (see 147050). The effect of eotaxin 1 +123Ala to
Thr on total serum IgE appeared in a gene dose-dependent manner. The
authors suggested that the development of asthma may be associated with
eotaxin 2 +1272A-G polymorphisms, and the susceptibility to high IgE
production may be attributed to the eotaxin 1 +123Ala to Thr
polymorphism. In an erratum, the authors noted that the first base of
the translation start site of the eotaxin 2 genomic reference sequence
had been denoted as +1, introducing some errors in the numbering of the
eotaxin 2 SNPs.

Modi et al. (2003) identified 3 SNPs that formed a 31-kb haplotype (H7;
see 601156.0001) spanning the CCL2-CCL7-CCL11 gene cluster on chromosome
17q. The SNPs and the H7 haplotype were significantly associated with
protection from HIV-1 infection (see 609423).

Batra et al. (2007) analyzed 3 polymorphisms in the CCL11 gene and a
hexanucleotide (GAAGGA)n repeat (601156.0002) located 10.9 kb upstream
of the gene in 235 patients with asthma and 239 age-, sex-, and
ethnically matched controls and in 230 families with asthma from
northern India. The authors found a highly significant association of
the hexanucleotide repeat with asthma (p = 3 x 10(-6)).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TYPE 1, RESISTANCE TO
CCL11, -1385G-A

Modi et al. (2003) genotyped 9 SNPs spanning the CCL2 (158105)-CCL7
(158106)-CCL11 gene cluster on chromosome 17q in more than 3,000 DNA
samples from 5 AIDS cohorts (see 609423). Extensive linkage
disequilibrium was observed, particularly for 3 SNPs, -2136T in the CCL2
promoter (158105.0001), 767G in intron 1 of the CCL2 gene (158105.0002),
and -1385A in the CCL11 promoter, that formed a 31-kb haplotype (H7)
containing the 3 genes. The frequencies of these 3 SNPs and the H7
haplotype were significantly elevated in uninfected individuals
repeatedly exposed to HIV-1 through high-risk sexual behavior or
contaminated blood products. Since these chemokines do not bind the
primary HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 (601373) or CXCR4 (162643), Modi et al.
(2003) proposed that the influence of the H7 haplotype on HIV-1
transmission may result from activation of the immune system rather than
receptor blockage.

Batra et al. (2007) studied 235 patients with asthma (600807) and 239
age-, sex-, and ethnically matched controls and 230 families with asthma
from northern India and found a significant association between a
polymorphic hexanucleotide (GAAGGA)n repeat, located 10.9 kb upstream of
the CCL11 gene, and asthma (p = 3 x 10(-6)). The hexanucleotide repeat
was also associated with total serum IgE levels (p = 0.006) and eotaxin
levels (p = 0.004).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Her et al. (1996) and Dooley and Huang (1996) reported the sequence of
the SULT1A2 gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sulfonation is an important pathway in the biotransformation of many
drugs, xenobiotics, neurotransmitters, and steroid hormones. The
thermostable form of phenol sulfotransferase preferentially catalyzes
the sulfonation of 'simple' planar phenols. The phenol sulfotransferase
STP1 (171150) maps to chromosome 16. Her et al. (1996) determined the
structure and chromosomal localization of the gene encoding a second
phenol sulfotransferase, STP2. The gene spans approximately 5.1 kb and
contains 9 exons that range in length from 74 to 347 bp. Exons 1A and 1B
as well as the 5-prime portion of exon 2 and the 3-prime portion of exon
8 are noncoding. The locations of most STP2 exon/intron splice junctions
are identical to those of a gene for the thermolabile form of PST in
humans, STM (600641), which maps to 16p close to the location of the
thermostable STP1.

Dooley and Huang (1996) determined that 7 coding exons are conserved
among the human STP1, STP2, and STM (600641) genes. The initiator
methionine is found on exon 2. All 3 genes colocalized on a single
cosmid from chromosome 16p12.1-p11.2 and have a high degree of sequence
homology, suggesting that these 3 genes arose by gene duplication.
Dooley and Huang (1996) stated that the previously identified PST gene
sequences HAST4, HAST4v, and ST1A2 are isolates of the STP2 gene.

MAPPING

Her et al. (1996) mapped STP2 to human chromosome 16 by PCR with DNA
from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD99 is a 32-kD T-cell surface glycoprotein involved in spontaneous
rosette formation with erythrocytes (Bernard et al., 1988). The gene
encoding CD99 (MIC2X) is located in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) at
the end of the short arm of the X and Y chromosomes (Goodfellow et al.,
1983). See also MIC2Y (450000).

CLONING

The monoclonal antibody 12E7 was raised against human leukemia T cells.
It detects a 30,000 MW protein which is expressed on all human tissues
tested with the possible exception of spermatozoa (Levy et al., 1979).

Dracopoli et al. (1985) described a monoclonal antibody, O13, that
defines a cell surface antigen that is expressed on most cultured human
cells but not on rodent cells. Glycoproteins of 25,000 and 30,000 MW
were precipitated by O13. Either the X or the Y chromosome in cultured
hybrid cells was sufficient for serologic reactivity with the antiserum.
The gene encoding O13 maps to Xp22-pter and apparently escapes
lyonization. All of these characteristics suggested that O13 was related
or identical to 12E7 and that MSK5X and MSK57 (so-called because the
workers were at Sloan-Kettering) were related or identical to MIC2X and
MIC2Y.

Darling et al. (1986) cloned the MIC2X and MIC2Y genes and concluded
that their sequences are closely related or identical.

Gelin et al. (1989) isolated a 1.11-kb cDNA from a lambda-gt11
expression library by screening with monoclonal antibodies directed
against E2 antigen. The primary structure of E2, deduced from the
nucleotide sequence of its gene, comprises 185 amino acids and is devoid
of N-linked glycosylation sites. The protein displays an organization
typical of an integral membrane protein. Nucleotide sequencing revealed
that E2 is the MIC2 gene product.

MAPPING

Goodfellow et al. (1983) showed that the gene for the E2 antigen, called
MIC2 (M = monoclonal; IC = Imperial Cancer Research Fund; 2 = order of
discovery), maps to the band between Xp22.3 and Xpter, where the STS
(300747) and Xg (300879) genes are located. Goodfellow et al. (1984)
showed that the MIC2X locus, like Xg and STS, escapes lyonization. They
identified a homologous locus on the Y chromosome (MIC2Y; 45000) in the
euchromatin region Ypter-q11.1. This was the first instance of a clear
Y-linked structural gene.

Curry et al. (1984) found that the STS, Xg, and MIC2X loci as well as
the locus for X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata (302950) were
apparently absent in males with deletion of Xp22.32.

By in situ hybridization, Buckle et al. (1985) showed that MIC2Y is
located on the distal part of Yp, namely, Ypter-p11.2.

On the basis of an X/Y translocation in which STS activity was retained
with the X chromosome (selected by fusion with an HPRT-deficient mouse
cell line) but MIC2X was lost, Geller et al. (1986) concluded that MIC2X
is distal to STS.

- Pseudogene

Mangs and Morris (2007) stated that the sequence identified by Smith and
Goodfellow (1994) as MIC2R (CD99L1) is a pseudogene that shares 78%
sequence homology with MIC2 (CD99). Smith and Goodfellow (1994) had
detected sequences related to exons 1, 4, and 5 of MIC2 on the X and Y
chromosomes of humans and other primate species. Isolation of these
sequences defined the MIC2R (MIC2-related) locus, which is associated
with the second-most proximal CpG-rich island in the human
pseudoautosomal region. Genomic sequences from the MIC2R locus showed
that it is composed of a single sequence related to exon 1 and at least
4 tandem copies of sequences related to exons 4 and 5 of MIC2.
Comparison of the 4 sequences related to exons 4 and 5 suggested that
they are the result of sequential duplication of a 2.8-kb region during
evolution. Smith and Goodfellow (1994) detected transcripts from the
MIC2R locus in at least 10 adult and fetal tissues, and a number of
different transcripts appear to be generated by alternative RNA
splicing. Since none of the transcripts they analyzed contained a
significant open reading frame, the function of the MIC2R locus remained
unknown.

GENE FUNCTION

Gelin et al. (1989) found that Xg(a-) females (see 314700) have no E2
molecule on the surface of their red cells, in contrast with Xg(a+)
individuals, but have the molecule in their cytoplasm, in the form of
the 28-kD precursor. Thus, the MIC2 gene encodes a cell surface molecule
involved in T-cell adhesion processes.

Kovar et al. (1990) noted that Ewing sarcoma and other PNE tumors
express high amounts of a glycoprotein on their cell surface, which
could be specifically detected by the monoclonal antibody HBA-71. They
identified this glycoprotein as the product of the pseudoautosomal gene
CD99. Kovar et al. (1990) presented evidence that CD99 is expressed at
low levels in most, if not all, human cells and normal tissues. Because
expression of CD99 is significantly enhanced in ES and PNET cells, they
suggested that detection of the antigen by immunocytochemical analysis
might be a useful tool in tumor diagnosis. Khoury (2005) stated that
strong diffuse CD99 immunostaining constitutes a useful positive marker
for the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors.

Goodfellow et al. (1987) presented evidence suggesting the existence of
a pseudoautosomal locus, XGR (314705), that regulates expression of MIC2
and XG.

Using flow cytometry and Western and Northern blot analyses, Fouchet et
al. (2000) provided a quantitative estimation of XG and CD99 on human
erythrocytes. Their findings supported the hypothesis of genetic control
of XG and CD99 expression by the hypothetical XGR locus.

Fouchet et al. (2000) examined coexpression of human XG and CD99 cDNAs
in transfected mouse cells, either in double transfectants or in somatic
hybrids from single transfectants. Their findings were consistent with
transcriptional coregulation of XG and CD99 expression, because no
influence of either protein on the surface production of the other was
observed. In addition, Fouchet et al. (2000) found no evidence of
association or complex formation between XG and CD99 on transfected
mouse cells or human erythrocytes.

Using flow cytometric analysis, Pettersen et al. (2001) demonstrated
that activation of a distinct domain of CD99 activates a
caspase-independent death pathway in T cells. Ligation of FAS (TNFRSF6;
134637) and TRAIL (TNFSF10; 603598) death receptors was less effective
than CD99 ligation in controlling transformed T cells.

Bixel et al. (2010) found that antibodies against mouse Cd99 or Pecam1
(173445) trapped neutrophils between endothelial cells in vitro. In
contrast, electron and 3-dimensional confocal microscopy of inflamed
cremaster demonstrated that antibodies against Cd99 or Cd99l2 (300846)
or Pecam1 gene deletion led to accumulation of neutrophils in vivo
between endothelial cells and basement membrane rather than between
endothelial cells. Antibodies against Cd99 or Cd99l2 in combination with
Pecam1 deficiency resulted in additive inhibitory effects on leukocyte
extravasation in 2 different inflammation models. Bixel et al. (2010)
concluded that CD99 and CD99L2 act independently of PECAM1 but at the
same site during diapedesis, i.e., between endothelial cells and the
basement membrane.

HISTORY

Polymorphism at the Xg locus and the Yg locus shows similar allele
frequencies. This could be due to chance, to selection, or to
recombination between the X and Y chromosomes (Burgoyne, 1982).

Tippett et al. (1986) presented family and sibship analysis to prove
that the 12E7 quantitative polymorphism of red cells is controlled by
the Y-borne locus, Yg, in addition to the X-borne locus, Xg. X-Y
recombination was invoked to explain the apparent exception to Y-borne
control in 1 family.

Goodfellow et al. (1986) stated that MIC2 recombines with TDF
(testis-determining factor) at a frequency of 2 to 3%. MIC2 was the most
proximal autosomal locus described to that time and a useful marker in
studies directed toward isolation of TDF. The order of Y-specific
sequences located proximal to the sex-determining gene(s), and therefore
not pseudoautosomal, has been determined on the basis of their presence
or absence in DNA from XX males, and the order of pseudoautosomal loci
situated distal to TDF has been established through family studies such
as those presented by Goodfellow et al. (1986).

During meiosis, pairing of the X and Y begins at the ends of the short
arms. Cooke et al. (1985) found sequence homology in the pairing regions
of the human X and Y. Because of a high order of polymorphism, they
could do family studies which showed what they termed 'pseudoautosomal'
inheritance, whereas Cooke et al. (1985) used repetitive sequences for
this demonstration. Simmler et al. (1985) used a single-copy genomic DNA
fragment which occurred in different allelic forms shared by both sex
chromosomes. Homologous segments of the X and Y have been suspected
because the 2 have a common ancestral origin; there is karyologic
evidence for pairing and crossing-over and, in man, the Turner phenotype
suggests deficiency of genetic material located on the second sex
chromosome.

611213	TITLE *611213 RELT-LIKE 2; RELL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database analysis to search for sequences with similarity to RELT
(611211), Cusick et al. (2006) cloned full-length RELL1 (611212) and
RELL2. The predicted RELL2 sequence contains a transmembrane domain but
lacks extracellular cysteine-rich domains. RELL2 shares 27% and 40%
amino acid identity with RELT and RELL1, respectively. Northern blot
analysis detected an approximately 3-kb transcript primarily in human
immune-related tissues such as spleen, thymus, testis, peripheral blood
leukocytes, and placenta. RELL2 mRNA was not detected in prostate,
ovary, small intestine, colon, heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle,
kidney, or pancreas. Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy localized
RELL2 to the plasma membrane in COS-7 cells and colocalized RELL2 with
RELL1 and RELT.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation studies, Cusick et al. (2006) showed that
showed that RELL2 bound RELL1, RELT, and serine-threonine kinase OSR1
(OXSR1; 604046). By in vitro kinase assay, Cusick et al. (2006) showed
that RELL1, RELL2, and RELT were phosphorylated by OSR1.

610434	TITLE *610434 LYMPHOCYTE ANTIGEN 6 COMPLEX, LOCUS G5C; LY6G5C
;;G5C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LY6G5C belongs to a cluster of leukocyte antigen-6 (LY6) genes located
in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on
chromosome 6. Members of the LY6 superfamily typically contain 70 to 80
amino acids, including 8 to 10 cysteines. Most LY6 proteins are attached
to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that
is directly involved in signal transduction (Mallya et al., 2002).

CLONING

By EST database searching and RT-PCR analysis, Mallya et al. (2002)
obtained LY6G5C cDNAs. The predicted protein contains an N-terminal
signal peptide, followed by a cys-rich LY6 domain. RT-PCR detected a
444-bp product in T-cell lines and fetal and adult lung. Several other
transcripts were detected, but all contained premature stop codons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mallya et al. (2002) determined that the LY6G5C gene contains 4 exons
and spans at least 7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Mallya et al. (2002) mapped the LY6G5C
gene to a LY6 gene cluster within the MHC class III region on chromosome
6p21.3.

610257	TITLE *610257 SEC31, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, A; SEC31A
;;SEC31-LIKE 1; SEC31L1;;
KIAA0905
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEC31A is a subunit of coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles,
which are essential for secretion (Jin et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned SEC31L1, which they designated
KIAA0905. The deduced protein contains 1,220 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected moderate expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
brain regions examined.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to yeast Sec31,
followed by screening a pancreas cDNA library, Tang et al. (2000) cloned
SEC31L1, which they called SEC31A. The deduced 1,218-amino acid protein
shares 25.8% identity with yeast Sec31. It contains 5 WD40 or WD40-like
repeats at its N terminus and a proline-rich region in its C-terminal
half. Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb transcript that was
abundantly and ubiquitously expressed. In rat kidney cells, Sec31a
colocalized with Sec13 (SEC13L1; 600152) in vesicular-tubular structures
characteristic of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunostaining for Sec31a in intact and permeabilized rat kidney
cells, Tang et al. (2000) found that Sec31a was not tightly associated
with the membrane. Binding of Sec31a to specific membrane structures was
restored by incubating washed cells with cytosol, indicating that Sec31a
was recruited to membranes. The membrane association of Sec31a was
greatly enhanced in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. Tang
et al. (2000) demonstrated that Sec31A and Sec13 coimmunoprecipitated
and that the proteins existed in a 600- to 700-kD complex.
Immunodepletion studies showed that rat Sec31a was required for
ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport.

Jin et al. (2012) found that monoubiquitination of Sec31 in mouse
embryonic stem cells by Klhl12 (614522) and the Cul3 (603136) E3
ubiquitin ligase complex was required for COPII vesicle expansion to
accommodate large cargo proteins, such as procollagens (see 120150). A
Sec31-binding mutant of Klhl12 neither colocalized with Sec31 at
intracellular vesicles nor induced formation of large vesicles.
Disruption of KLHL12-CUL3 function in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells
impaired COPII vesicle expansion and collagen export, but it had no
effect on export of smaller cargo by small COPII vesicles. Jin et al.
(2012) concluded that KLHL12-CUL3 monoubiquitination of SEC31 is
required for COPII vesicle expansion to accommodate large or bulky cargo
molecules.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the SEC31L1
gene to chromosome 4.

;;NUCLEOLAR RNA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; NRAP;;
UTP22, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; UTP22
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a mouse embryonic stem cell cDNA library with a partial
Nol6 clone, followed by 5-prime RACE, database analysis, and RT-PCR of
human hepatic cell line RNA, Utama et al. (2002) cloned full-length
human and mouse NOL6, which they called NRAP. They identified
NOL6-alpha, -beta, and -gamma isoforms that contain 1,146, 1,007, and
699 amino acids, respectively. NOL6-alpha shares 88% amino acid identity
with mouse Nol6-alpha. Both human and mouse coding regions are GC-rich
and share weak homology to a PAP/25A core domain, which is found in
poly(A) polymerases (605553). NOL6 contains potential nuclear
localization signals and has several potential phosphorylation sites.
Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies localized Nol6
expression within the nucleolus in a variety of rodent cell lines,
although expression was not specifically localized to rRNA transcription
sites. Nol6 localized to the condensed chromosomes during mitosis in a
pattern similar to that of B23/nucleophosmin (NPM1; 164040). In situ
hybridization studies in mouse embryos showed ubiquitous Nol6 expression
during development. Immunoblot studies of mouse tissues detected strong
expression in spleen, testis, colon, kidney, stomach, and brain, with
moderate expression in lung, liver, and small intestine, and low
expression in heart and skeletal muscle.

By database analysis, Bernstein et al. (2004) identified NOL6 as the
human ortholog of yeast Utp22. Utp22 is a component of a yeast
ribonucleoprotein required for biogenesis of the 18S rRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Utama et al. (2002) showed that both actinomycin D and RNase treatment
disrupted Nol6 nucleolar localization while cyclohexamide had no effect.
They suggested that Nol6 interacts either directly or indirectly with
the pre-rRNA transcript.

GENE STRUCTURE

Utama et al. (2002) determined that the NOL6 gene contains 26 exons
spanning 11.4 kb. Alternative splicing excludes exons 24 and 25 in
NOL6-beta and skips exons 16 to 25 in the NOL6-gamma isoform.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Utama et al. (2002) mapped the NOL6 gene
to chromosome 9p13.

;;KIR2.4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family are
characterized by a channel structure with 2 transmembrane segments
surrounding putative pore loop. The Kir2 subfamily contains channels
characterized by their strong current rectification. By screening a rat
brain library with a bovine PCR fragment based on a human Kir-like EST
(GenBank GENBANK W25800), Topert et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding
Kir2.4, a Kir2 subfamily member. In situ hybridization revealed that
Kir2.4 is expressed predominantly in motoneurons of cranial nerve motor
nuclei within the general somatic and special visceral motor cell
column. The unique Kir2.4 expression pattern and in situ measurements of
the functional characteristics of Kir2.4 in rat brainstem led the
authors to conclude that these channels serve an important function in
controlling the excitability of brainstem motoneurons. Northern blot
analysis revealed that Kir2.4 is expressed specifically in human brain.

;;LEUCINE AMINOPEPTIDASE OF PLACENTA;;
OXYTOCINASE;;
INSULIN-RESPONSIVE AMINOPEPTIDASE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; IRAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Beckman et al. (1966) found 3 placental leucine aminopeptidase (LAP)
types. (LAP enzymes in the serum of pregnant women probably are not
derived from placenta.) Beckman et al. (1969) stated a preference for
the designation amino acid naphthylamidase. The serum level of placental
LAP increases during pregnancy and degrades several peptide hormones
such as oxytocin (167050) and vasopressin (192340).

Rogi et al. (1996) cloned a human placenta cDNA encoding leucyl-cystinyl
aminopeptidase, which they symbolized PLAP. The deduced 944-amino acid
polypeptide contains the HEXXH consensus sequence of zinc
metallopeptidases as well as an N-terminal hydrophobic region that
resembles a transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of 3.6-kb and 10.5-kb transcripts in placenta, heart, and
skeletal muscle, and a 10.5-kb transcript in brain. Using
immunohistochemistry, Nagasaka et al. (1997) localized LNPEP to
syncytiotrophoblasts in placenta as well as in fetal and adult vascular
endothelial cells, the epithelial lining of several organs, neurons, and
sweat gland cells; adult seminal vesicles and prostate; and fetal
adipocytes and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

In muscle and fat cells, insulin (INS; 176730) stimulation activates a
signaling cascade that causes intracellular vesicles containing glucose
transporter-4 (GLUT4, or SLC2A4; 138190) to translocate to and fuse with
the plasma membrane. Using mass spectrometry, Larance et al. (2005)
identified Irap as a major membrane protein associated with Glut4
vesicles in cultured mouse adipocytes. The Rab GTPase-activating protein
As160 (TBC1D4; 612465), another major constituent of Glut4 vesicles,
interacted directly with the cytoplasmic tail of Irap in vitro and in
vivo. Since As160 dissociated from Glut4 vesicles upon insulin
stimulation, Larance et al. (2005) concluded that interaction between
AS160 and IRAP mediates association of AS160 with GLUT4 vesicles.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules present
peptides, produced through cytosolic proteasomal degradation of cellular
proteins, to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In dendritic cells, the peptides
can also be derived from internalized antigens through a process known
as crosspresentation. Saveanu et al. (2009) identified a role for
peptide trimming by IRAP in crosspresentation. In human dendritic cells,
IRAP was localized to a Rab14+ endosomal storage compartment in which it
interacted with MHC class I molecules. IRAP deficiency compromised
crosspresentation in vitro and in vivo but did not affect endogenous
presentation. Saveanu et al. (2009) proposed the existence of 2 pathways
for proteasome-dependent crosspresentation in which final peptide
trimming involves IRAP in endosomes and involves the related
aminopeptidases in the endoplasmic reticulum.

GENE STRUCTURE

Horio et al. (1999) isolated and sequenced genomic clones containing the
upstream region of LNPEP and identified 4 GC-rich sequences, a TATA box,
and 3 half palindromic estrogen-responsive element (ERE)-like motifs.

MAPPING

By FISH, Horio et al. (1999) mapped the LNPEP gene to chromosome
5q14.2-q15.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mouse Irap, a zinc-dependent membrane aminopeptidase, is the homolog of
human LNPEP. Keller et al. (2002) characterized Irap-null mice with
regard to glucose homeostasis and regulation of the insulin-responsive
glucose transporter Glut4 (138190). Irap-null mice maintained normal
glucose homeostasis despite decreased glucose uptake into muscle and fat
cells. The absence of Irap did not affect the subcellular distribution
of Glut4 in adipocytes, but it led to a substantial decrease in Glut4
expression.

611838	TITLE *611838 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L30; MRPL30
;;MRPL28
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL30 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of rat Mrpl28, Goldschmidt-Reisin et
al. (1998) identified mouse and human MRPL30, which they called MRPL28.
The deduced 162-amino acid human MRPL30 protein contains a 34-amino acid
N-terminal mitochondrial import signal.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPL30 gene to chromosome 2q11.2.

604881	TITLE *604881 RABPHILIN 3A-LIKE; RPH3AL
;;NOC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a DNA fragment encoding the Rab3A (179490)-binding domain of a
mouse rabphilin-3A (RPH3A; 612159) cDNA, Kotake et al. (1997) probed a
rat islet cDNA library under low stringency and identified rat Rph3al,
which they designated Noc2. A full-length Noc2 clone was isolated from a
rat insulin-secreting cell line cDNA library. The Noc2 cDNA encodes a
302-amino acid protein that shows 40.7% amino acid identity and 77.9%
similarity to the N-terminal region of rat rabphilin-3A. However, it
lacks the C2 domains, and hence the Noc2 (no C2 domain) designation.
Noc2 contains 1 potential protein kinase A and 3 potential protein
kinase C phosphorylation sites. RNA blot analysis revealed that a single
2.2- or 2.6-kb transcript of Noc2 is expressed at very high levels in
pancreatic islets, and at low to moderate or high levels in other
endocrine tissues and hormone-secreting cell lines, but at very low
levels in brain. Screening a mouse embryonic cDNA library with the yeast
2-hybrid system, Kotake et al. (1997) showed that Noc2 interacts with
the LIM domain-containing protein zyxin (602002), a component of the
cytoskeleton. The authors suggested that Noc2 is probably involved in
regulated exocytosis in endocrine cells by interacting with the
cytoskeleton.

Using cDNA selection, Smith et al. (1999) identified a human transcript
spanning a common deletion on 17p13.3 found in approximately 40% of
medulloblastomas. The full-length coding sequence predicted a 315-amino
acid protein displaying 77% amino acid identity with the rat Noc2
(Rph3al) protein. Northern blot analysis detected moderate to high
expression of a 2.6-kb RPH3AL transcript in thyroid, ovary, stomach,
heart, pancreas, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Smith et al. (1999) determined that the RPH3AL gene contains 9 exons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Smith et al. (1999) determined that at least 1 exon of the RPH3AL gene
maps within the common 9-kb deletion on chromosome 17p13.3 found in
medulloblastomas. However, they found no mutations in this gene in 33
tumor samples with allelic loss of 17p13, including 10 medulloblastomas,
14 follicular thyroid cancers, and 9 ovarian cancers.

182350	TITLE *182350 ATPase, Na+/K+ TRANSPORTING, ALPHA-3 POLYPEPTIDE; ATP1A3
;;SODIUM-POTASSIUM-ATPase, ALPHA-3 POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The alpha subunit of the Na,K-ATPase is the catalytic subunit. Three
isoforms are expressed in the nervous system: ATP1A1 (182310), ATP1A2
(182340), and ATP1A3 (de Carvalho Aguiar et al., 2004).

GENE FUNCTION

Agrin (AGRN; 103320) mediates accumulation of acetylcholine receptors at
the developing neuromuscular junction through its interaction with MUSK
(601296), and it has also been implicated in brain development. Through
biochemical studies, Hilgenberg et al. (2006) found that agrin bound
Atp1a3 in mouse cortical neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that Atp1a3 colocalized with agrin-binding sites at synapses. Agrin
inhibited Atp1a3 activity, resulting in membrane depolarization and
increased action potential frequency in mouse cortical neurons in
culture and acute slice. An agrin fragment that acted as a competitive
antagonist depressed action potential frequency, indicating that
endogenous agrin regulates native Atp1a3 function. Hilgenberg et al.
(2006) concluded that agrin regulates activity-dependent processes in
neurons through its interaction with ATP1A3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ovchinnikov et al. (1988) determined that the ATP1A3 gene has about
25,000 basepairs and that its protein-coding region includes 23 exons.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of DNA from panels of rodent/human somatic cell
hybrid lines, Yang-Feng et al. (1988) mapped the ATP1A3 gene to
chromosome 19q12-q13.2. Harley et al. (1988) concluded that the order is
qter--DM--APOC2--ATP1A3--cen.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Dystonia 12

In 7 unrelated families with rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, or
dystonia-12 (DYT12; 128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified
6 different heterozygous mutations in the ATP1A3 gene
(182350.0001-182350.0006). Functional expression studies and structural
analysis suggested that the mutations impaired enzyme activity or
stability.

Anselm et al. (2009) and Blanco-Arias et al. (2009) reported de novo
heterozygous ATP1A3 mutations (182350.0007 and 182350.0008,
respectively) in patients with DYT12.

- Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood 2

In 82 of 105 patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood-2 (AHC2;
615820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified 19 different heterozygous
mutations in the ATP1A3 gene (see, e.g., 182350.0009-182350.0012). The
first mutations were identified through exome sequencing of affected
individuals. Thirteen of the 18 mutations observed in sporadic cases
were confirmed to occur de novo. Since it was possible that some
variants represented polymorphisms, Heinzen et al. (2012) estimated that
mutations in the ATP1A3 gene may be responsible for up to 74% of
patients with sporadic, typical AHC. Several mutations were recurrent,
and some occurred within hypermutable sequences. All patients had
infantile onset of hemiplegia attacks, usually associated with episodes
of quadriparesis, abnormal eye movements, autonomic signs, seizures,
dystonia, ataxia, chorea, and developmental delay. Transfection of
several of the mutations in HeLa cells showed protein levels similar to
wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was significantly decreased. In contrast,
transfection of DYT12-associated mutations resulted in decreased protein
levels as well as decreased activity. The report expanded the spectrum
of phenotypes associated with mutations in the ATP1A3 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ashmore et al. (2009) identified 6 different EMS-induced missense
mutations in the Atp1a2 and Atp1a3 genes in Drosophila. All mutations
resulted in reduced respiration activity consistent with a loss of
ATPase function and a hypomorphic effect. Different mutant strains
exhibited some abnormalities, including progressive
temperature-dependent paralysis, progressive stress-sensitive paralysis,
and decreased locomotor activity in response to startle, suggesting a
decrease in maximal locomotion capacity. Neuromuscular studies showed
allele-specific pathology, including brain vacuoles and myopathology,
and biochemical studies showed decreased metabolic rates. An unexpected
finding was the some mutant strains had increased longevity, which was
not related to caloric restriction. Low doses of ouabain showed a
similar effect on longevity in control groups. Ashmore et al. (2009)
suggested that these findings may be relevant for studying the
pathogenesis of FHM2 and DYT12 (128235).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, THR613MET

In a sporadic patient (Linazasoro et al., 2002) and affected members of
a second family (Zaremba et al., 2004) with dystonia-12 (DYT12; 128235),
de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 1838C-T
transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a thr613-to-met (T613M)
substitution in a highly conserved residue near the phosphorylation
domain on the cytoplasmic face of the protein. The mutation was not
identified in 500 northern European control chromosomes.

Brashear et al. (2007) identified the T613M mutation in a family with
DYT12 reported by Pittock et al. (2000).

.0002
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ILE274THR

In a patient with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 821T-C transition in the ATP1A3 gene,
resulting in an ile274-to-thr (I274T) substitution in a highly conserved
residue in the transmembrane domain of the protein. The mutation was not
identified in 500 northern European control chromosomes. The patient had
disease onset at age 37 years.

.0003
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, GLU277LYS

In a patient with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004)
identified a heterozygous 829G-A transition in exon 8 of the ATP1A3
gene, resulting in a glu277-to-lys (E277K) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the transmembrane domain of the protein. The
mutation was not identified in 500 northern European control
chromosomes. The patient had disease onset at age 20 years.

Tarsy et al. (2010) identified the E277K mutation in a 29-year-old woman
of African Caribbean descent with DYT12. She had onset at age 26 years
of weakness and flexion of the left hand and ankle, which progressed
rapidly over the next few years to become frank dystonia of the left arm
and bulbar symptoms, including dysphagia, laryngeal dysfunction with
task-specific dysphonia, and oropharyngeal dysmotility. She also had
mild parkinsonism, with hypomimia and wide-based gait. Treatment with
oral trihexyphenidyl and botulinum injection into selected laryngeal
muscles resulted in clinical improvement.

.0004
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ILE758SER

In 12 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235) reported by
Dobyns et al. (1993), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2273T-G transversion in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an
ile758-to-ser (I758S) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane domain of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0005
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, PHE780LEU

In 2 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235), de Carvalho
Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 2338T-C transition in the
ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a phe780-to-leu (F780L) substitution in a
highly conserved residue in the transmembrane region of the protein
close to the extracellular surface. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0006
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ASP801TYR

In 4 affected members of a family with dystonia-12 (128235) reported by
Brashear et al. (1997), de Carvalho Aguiar et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2401G-T transversion in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an
asp801-to-tyr (D801Y) substitution in a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane region of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
500 northern European control chromosomes.

.0007
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, ASP923ASN

In a boy with early-onset DYT12 (128235) at age 4 years, Anselm et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous de novo 2767G-A transition in exon 20
of the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an asp923-to-asn (D923N) substitution.
The mutation was not found in 338 Caucasian control chromosomes. The
substitution was predicted to occur in a residue buried in the membrane
close to the ion-binding residue gln920, suggesting that it may affect
enzyme activity. He was born of an unaffected Caucasian father and
Chinese mother. The onset of dystonia was abrupt, occurring after mild
trauma to the forehead. He developed mutism, eye convergence, and
inability to walk, which later evolved into severe dystonia, severe
dysarthria, and drooling. The condition stabilized over several months,
and he showed mild improvement over the next 8 years. About a year after
onset, he developed unusual episodes of flaccidity lasting for hours,
later replaced by shorter episodes of stiffness. Treatment with L-dopa
was not effective. At the time of the report, he had bulbar symptoms,
striking oromotor dystonia with inability to speak or swallow well, and
apraxia.

.0008
DYSTONIA 12
ATP1A3, 3-BP DUP, 3191TAC

In a 16-year-old female with DYT12 (128235), Blanco-Arias et al. (2009)
reported a de novo heterozygous 3-bp duplication (3191dupTAC) in exon 23
of the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in duplication of tyr1013, the C-terminal
amino acid of the protein before the stop codon. The mutation was not
found in either parent, her brother, or in 218 control individuals. HeLa
cells expressing the mutant protein showed decreased survival in
response to ouabain challenge, but no defect was detected in protein
expression or plasma membrane targeting. Functional analysis
demonstrated a drastic 40- to 50-fold reduction in Na(+) affinity in the
mutant. Blanco-Arias et al. (2009) suggested a crucial role for the C
terminus of the alpha-subunit in the function of the Na+/K+-ATPase and
emphasized a key impact of Na(+) affinity in the pathophysiology of
DYT12.

.0009
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, ASP801ASN

In 36 of 95 unrelated patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood
(614820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 2401G-A
transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in an asp801-to-asn (D801N)
substitution in the sixth transmembrane domain. The mutation was
demonstrated to occur de novo in cases where parental material was
available. All patients had infantile onset of hemiplegia attacks,
usually associated with episodes of quadriparesis, abnormal eye
movements, autonomic signs, seizures, dystonia, ataxia, chorea, and
developmental delay. Transfection of the mutation in HeLa cells showed
protein levels similar to wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was
significantly decreased. Evaluation of the crystal structure of the
protein predicted that the D801N substitution would prevent the binding
of potassium ions to the pump.

.0010
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, GLU815LYS

In 19 patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood-2 (614820),
Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 2443G-A transition in
the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a glu815-to-lys (E815K) substitution in
the sixth transmembrane domain. The mutation was shown to occur de novo
in all patients whose parents were available for study. Transfection of
the mutation in HeLa cells showed protein levels similar to wildtype,
but ATP1A3 activity was significantly decreased.

.0011
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, SER811PRO

In 4 unrelated patients with AHC2 (614820), Heinzen et al. (2012)
identified a de novo heterozygous 2431T-C transition in the ATP1A3 gene,
resulting in a ser811-to-pro (S811P) substitution in the sixth
transmembrane domain. Transfection of the mutation in HeLa cells showed
protein levels similar to wildtype, but ATP1A3 activity was
significantly decreased.

.0012
ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD 2
ATP1A3, GLY947ARG

In 5 patients with AHC2 (614820), Heinzen et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 2839G-A transition in the ATP1A3 gene, resulting in a
gly947-to-arg (G947R) substitution in the ninth transmembrane domain.
The mutation was shown to occur de novo in all patients whose parents
were available for study.

238310	TITLE *238310 AMINOMETHYLTRANSFERASE; AMT
;;GLYCINE CLEAVAGE SYSTEM T PROTEIN; GCST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The enzyme system for cleavage of glycine (glycine cleavage system; EC
2.1.2.10), which is confined to the mitochondria, is composed of 4
protein components: P protein (a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent glycine
decarboxylase; GLDC, 238300), H protein (a lipoic acid-containing
protein; GCSH, 238330), T protein (a tetrahydrofolate-requiring enzyme),
and L protein (a lipoamide dehydrogenase; DLD, 238331).

Mutations in the T, P, and H proteins have been found to cause glycine
encephalopathy (GCE; 605899).

CLONING

The T protein of the glycine cleavage system is also known as
aminomethyltransferase (AMT). Nanao et al. (1994) isolated the AMT gene
from a human placenta cosmid library. They found that the gene is about
6 kb long and contains 9 exons. They identified 2 putative
glucocorticoid-responsive elements and a putative thyroid
hormone-responsive element. By dot-blot analysis, Kure et al. (2001)
detected expression of AMT in all tissues tested except stomach and bone
marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakata et al. (2001) reported the structure and expression of the
glycine cleavage system in rat central nervous system.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nanao et al. (1994) assigned the
AMT gene to 3p21.2-p21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with glycine encephalopathy, Nanao et al. (1994) identified
mutations in the AMT gene (238310.0001-238310.0002).

Toone et al. (2000) studied 14 unrelated patients with glycine
encephalopathy and identified mutations in 4 cases. In 2 patients,
mutations were identified in the T protein: 1 patient was homozygous for
an arg320-to-his mutation (R320H; 238310.0006), and the other patient
was heterozygous for a novel glutamine-to-termination substitution at
codon 192 (238310.0007).

Applegarth and Toone (2001) reviewed the laboratory diagnosis of glycine
encephalopathy and confirmed 9 mutations in the T protein and 8
mutations in the P protein. They also reviewed the 7 cases of transient
NKH known at that time.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY269ASP

Nanao et al. (1994) found that a patient with typical glycine
encephalopathy (605899) was homozygous for a missense mutation in the
AMT gene, a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-asp substitution at
amino acid 269 (G269D).

.0002
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY47ARG

In 2 sisters with atypical glycine encephalopathy (605899), Nanao et al.
(1994) found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the T
protein gene: a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-arg substitution
at amino acid 47 (G47R) in 1 allele, and a G-to-A transition leading to
an arg-to-his substitution at amino acid 320 (R320H; 238310.0006) in the
other allele. Nanao et al. (1994) pointed out that gly269, which was
mutant in the typically severe case they studied (see 238300.0001), is
conserved in T proteins of various species, even in E. coli, whereas
gly47 and arg320, which were mutant in the atypical and milder cases,
are replaced by ala and leu, respectively, in E. coli. Thus, mutation
occurring in more conservative amino acid residues results in more
deleterious damage to the T protein and a more severe clinical
phenotype.

.0003
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, HIS42ARG

Kure et al. (1998) reported a large Israeli-Arab kindred with glycine
encephalopathy (605899). Enzymatic analysis demonstrated that T-protein
activity was deficient in the liver from 1 affected person in the
family. Mutation detection revealed a missense mutation in exon 2
resulting in an amino acid substitution from histidine to arginine at
position 42 (his42 to arg). Homozygosity for the H42R mutation was seen
in all affected members of the family.

.0004
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, 1-BP DEL, 183C

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899), Kure et al.
(1998) described a 1-bp deletion (183delC) and a missense mutation,
asp276 to his (238310.0005).

.0005
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ASP276HIS

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899) of neonatal
onset, Kure et al. (1998) found a G-to-C substitution at position 955 in
exon 7, resulting in an amino acid change from aspartate to histidine at
position 276.

.0006
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ARG320HIS

See 238310.0001 and Nanao et al. (1994).

Toone et al. (2001) screened a DNA bank from 50 patients with
enzymatically confirmed NKH and identified the arg320-to-his (R320H)
mutation in 7% of alleles.

.0007
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLN192TER

In a patient with neonatal-onset NKH (605899), Toone et al. (2000)
identified a C-to-T transition resulting in a glutamine-to-termination
codon substitution at residue 192 (Q192X). The other mutation in this
patient was not identified.

.0008
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, IVS7, G-A, -1

Toone et al. (2001) reported a novel splice site mutation at the -1
position of intron 7 of the AMT gene: G was converted to A. This
mutation was found in 3 unrelated families and was not found in any
normal controls.

606110	TITLE *606110 LY6/NEUROTOXIN 1; LYNX1
;;SECRETED LY6/PLAUR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; SLURP2;;
SECRETED LY6/UPAR-RELATED PROTEIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LYNX1 gene encodes a protein that shares characteristics with toxins
that bind and inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR; see,
e.g., CHRNA1, 100690) (Miwa et al., 1999). Components of snake venoms
often have structural and functional mammalian homologs. For example,
hemolytic snake venom toxins are related to cellular phospholipases
(e.g., PLA2G1B; 172410), and snake sarafotoxins may be related to
vertebrate endothelins (e.g., EDN1; 131240). The elapid venom
alpha-bungarotoxin also binds to and inhibits nAChR.

CLONING

By screening for central nervous system-specific, developmentally
regulated cDNAs in mouse, Miwa et al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding
GC26, which was expressed in mouse cerebellum. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 116-amino acid protein contains a signal sequence at
its N terminus, a cysteine-rich consensus motif characteristic of LY6
family proteins (e.g., CD59; 107271) and snake alpha-neurotoxins, and an
asparagine/GPI anchor motif at its C terminus. The overall structure of
GC26 is similar to that of LY6 family proteins and snake
alpha-neurotoxins, and Miwa et al. (1999) redesignated the protein
'Ly6/neurotoxin-1,' or Lynx1. A partial sequence encoding a human Lynx1
homolog has been identified (GenBank GENBANK AF321824). Northern blot
analysis revealed predominant expression of Lynx1 in mouse brain. In
situ hybridization analysis showed Lynx1 expression in neurons in
multiple brain structures. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated expression
of Lynx1 in neuronal soma and proximal dendrites.

Using microarray analysis to identify ESTs expressed predominantly in
the skin of patients with psoriasis vulgaris (see 177900), followed by
PCR and RACE of cultured keratinocyte cDNA libraries, Tsuji et al.
(2003) cloned LYNX1, which they called SLURP2. The deduced 97-amino acid
protein contains a signal peptide and 10 conserved cysteine residues
with a spacing pattern characteristic of the LY6 superfamily, but it
does not have the GPI anchor or transmembrane domains found in
membrane-bound LY6 proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.6-kb
transcript in esophagus and a 1.6-kb transcript in stomach and duodenum.
No expression was detected in other tissues examined, including skin.
RT-PCR detected abundant LYNX1 expression in cervix and esophagus, with
lower expression in adult and fetal skin and keratinocytes. Weak
expression was detected in brain, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon,
rectum, uterus, and thymus. No expression was detected in spleen and
bone marrow. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected a 3.8- to
2.8-fold increase in LYNX1 expression in lesional skin from 5 psoriasis
patients compared with nonlesional skin or normal skin.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Miwa et al. (1999) indicated that Lynx1 is not a
ligand or neurotransmitter but has the capacity to enhance nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor function in the presence of acetylcholine.

Morishita et al. (2010) identified an increase in expression of Lynx1
protein in mice that prevented plasticity in the primary visual cortex
late in life. Removal of this molecular brake enhanced nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor signaling. Lynx1 expression thus maintains
stability of mature cortical networks in the presence of cholinergic
innervation. Morishita et al. (2010) concluded that modulating the
balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits reactivates visual
plasticity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsuji et al. (2003) determined that the LYNX1 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 5.6 kb. The promoter region contains 3 Sp1 (189906)- and 2
AP1 (165160)-binding sites, as well as single sites for E2F (189971) and
GATA3 (131320). It lacks TATA and CAAT consensus sequences. There are 2
major transcriptional initiation sites.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tsuji et al. (2003) mapped the LYNX1 gene
to chromosome 8q24.3. Southern blot analysis indicated that LYNX1 is a
single-copy gene.

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including LYNX1, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miwa et al. (2006) found that Lynx1 -/- mice showed no gross
abnormalities in size, viability, CNS morphology, or longevity compared
to wildtype mice. However, Lynx1-null mice showed increased learning and
memory in a fear-conditioned paradigm and displayed increased
sensitivity to nicotine in motor tasks compared to wildtype. Neurons
from Lynx1-null mice showed heightened sensitivity and increased
intracellular calcium levels in response to nicotine. Loss of Lynx1
decreased receptor desensitization and enhanced synaptic efficacy.
Mutant neurons were also more sensitive to excitotoxic insult, and Lynx1
mutant mice exhibited age-dependent degeneration that was exacerbated by
nicotine and rescued by null mutations in nAChR subunits. These data
supported the hypotheses that Lynx1 normally decreases activity of
nAChRs and that deletion of Lynx1 shifts the balance in favor of
increased neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. But the short-term
benefits of the loss of Lynx1 were counterbalanced by an increased
vulnerability of Lynx1 mutant neurons to glutamate toxicity and by loss
of nicotine's neuroprotective effect on these cells. Miwa et al. (2006)
concluded that Lynx1 modulates nAChR function to maintain low
sensitivity and plays a critical role in maintaining a balance between
the beneficial effects of short-term nAChR activation and the
degenerative effects of chronic receptor activation.

602618	TITLE *602618 C-TERMINAL-BINDING PROTEIN 1; CTBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The E1a region of group C adenoviruses encodes 2 nearly identical
proteins that are largely responsible for the oncogenic properties of
adenoviruses. Whereas the N-terminal half of these E1A proteins is
sufficient for transformation, the C-terminal half appears to modulate
transformation, tumorigenesis, and metastasis negatively. Boyd et al.
(1993) purified a HeLa cell protein, designated CTBP1, that specifically
binds to the C-terminal half of E1A proteins. CTBP1 is a phosphoprotein
that migrates as a 48-kD doublet by SDS-PAGE. Katsanis and Fisher (1998)
suggested that the doublet consists of CTBP1 and the closely related
CTBP2 (602619).

Schaeper et al. (1995) independently isolated a CTBP1 cDNA from a B-cell
library. The predicted 439-amino acid sequence contains the sequences of
2 peptides prepared from purified CTBP1. The authors
coimmunoprecipitated CTPB1 and an E1A protein from extracts of mammalian
cells that were expressing both proteins.

Furusawa et al. (1999) identified the mouse homologs of CTBP1 and CTBP2
in a yeast 2-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with delta-EF1
(TCF8; 189909), a transcriptional repressor that binds the E2-box
(CACCTG) and related sequences. Using 2-hybrid and direct binding
assays, they concluded that CtBP1 binds to the short medial portion of
delta-EF1 containing the PLDLSL motif. In cotransfection experiments,
they observed that CtBP1 enhanced the transrepression activity of
delta-EF1. Using Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization with
mouse embryos, Furusawa et al. (1999) detected CtBP1 expression
throughout developmental stages and in a wide range of adult tissues.
CtBP1 and CtBP2 expression correlates with delta-EF1 expression. The
authors hypothesized that CtBP1 and CtBP2 function as corepressors of
delta-EF1 action.

GENE FUNCTION

Polycomb (Pc) is part of a Pc group (PcG) protein complex that is
involved in repression of gene activity during Drosophila and vertebrate
development. Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Sewalt et al. (1999) found
that Xenopus Ctbp1 interacts with Xenopus Pc and that human CTBP2
interacts with PC2 (603079), a human Pc homolog. Immunofluorescence
studies indicated that CTBP1 and CTBP2 partially colocalize with PC2 in
large PcG domains in interphase nuclei. As with PC2, chimeric LexA-CTBP2
and LexA-CTBP1 proteins repressed gene activity when targeted to a
reporter gene. Sewalt et al. (1999) suggested that PC2-mediated
repression of gene expression involves an association with corepressors
such as the CTBPs. They speculated that the interference of the
adenoviral E1A protein with the transcription machinery of the infected
cell may involve interference with PcG-mediated repression through
disruption of the CTBP-PcG interaction. Northern blot analysis revealed
that the CTBP1 gene was expressed as a 2.4-kb mRNA in all human tissues
tested.

Pc2 recruits the transcriptional corepressor CTBP to PcG bodies. Kagey
et al. (2003) showed that CTBP is sumoylated at a single lysine. In
vitro, CTBP sumoylation minimally required the SUMO E1 and E2 (UBC9;
601661) and SUMO1 (601912). However, Pc2 dramatically enhanced CTBP
sumoylation. The authors proposed that, in vivo, this is likely due to
the ability of Pc2 to recruit both CTBP and UBC9 to PcG bodies, thereby
bringing together substrate and E2 and stimulating the transfer of SUMO
to CTBP. These results demonstrated that Pc2 is a SUMO E3 and suggested
that PcG bodies may be sumoylation centers.

Zhang et al. (2002) demonstrated that CTBP binding to cellular and viral
transcriptional repressors is regulated by NAD+ and NADH, with NADH
being 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more effective. Levels of free nuclear
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides, determined using 2-photon
microscopy, corresponded to the levels required for half-maximal CTBP
binding and were considerably lower than those previously reported.
Agents capable of increasing NADH levels stimulated CTBP binding to its
partners in vivo and potentiated CTBP-mediated repression. Zhang et al.
(2002) proposed that this ability to detect changes in nuclear NAD+/NADH
ratio allows CTBP to serve as a redox sensor for transcription.

Kumar et al. (2002) reported biochemical and crystallographic studies
that revealed that CTBP1 is a functional dehydrogenase. In addition,
both a cofactor-dependent conformational change, with NAD+ and NADH
being equivalently effective, and the active site residues were linked
to the binding of the PXDLS consensus recognition motif on repressors,
such as E1A and RIP140 (602490). They concluded that CTBP1 is an
NAD(+)-regulated component of critical complexes for specific repression
events in cells.

CTBP is recruited to DNA by transcription factors that contain a PXDLS
motif. Shi et al. (2003) reported the identification of a CTBP complex
that contains the essential components for both gene targeting and
coordinated histone modifications, allowing for the effective repression
of genes targeted by CTBP. This complex has a molecular mass of about
1.3 to 1.5 million and contains CTBP1 and CTBP2 as well as G9A (604599),
EUHMT (607001), COREST (607675), HDAC1 (601241) and HDAC2 (605164),
NPAO, REBB1, ZNF217 (602967), and KIAA0222. Immunoprecipitation with G9A
antibodies brought down the same components as well as HPC2 (ELAC2;
605367). Shi et al. (2003) found that inhibiting the expression of CTBP
and its associated histone-modifying activities by RNA-interference
resulted in alterations of histone modifications at the promoter of the
tumor invasion suppressor gene E-cadherin (192090) and increased
promoter activity in a reporter assay.

By yeast 3-hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2003) found that mouse Hipk2
(606868) interacted with an E1A-Ctbp complex. Expression of Hipk2 or
exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation reduced Ctbp levels via a
proteasome-mediated pathway. Coexpression of kinase-inactive Hipk2 or
small interfering RNA-mediated reduction in Hipk2 levels prevented the
UV effect. Mutation of Ctbp ser422 prevented phosphorylation as well as
UV- and Hipk2-directed Ctbp clearance. Deletion of Ctbp or reduction in
Ctbp levels promoted apoptosis in p53 (191170)-deficient cells.

Gallop et al. (2005) found that the lysophosphatidic acid
acyltransferase, or LPAAT, activity associated with CtBP/BARS (e.g.,
Weigert et al., 1999) is a copurification artifact.

Using a promoter pull-down assay followed by mass spectrometry analysis,
Flajollet et al. (2009) identified RREB1 (602209) as a protein that
bound the HLA-G (142871) promoter. RREB1 exerted repressive activity on
the promoter in HLA-G-negative cells that was mediated by recruitment of
HDAC1 and CTBP1 and/or CTBP2. The HLA-G promoter contains 3 RREB1 target
sites. Flajollet et al. (2009) proposed that the repressive activity of
RREB1 on the HLA-G promoter may be regulated by posttranslational
modifications governing its association with CTBP.

Deng et al. (2011) identified microRNA-137 (MIR137; 614304) as a
regulator of CTBP1 expression. Expression of MIR137 was inversely
correlated with that of CTBP1 in melanoma cell lines. The MIR137-binding
site in the 3-prime UTR of CTBP1 mRNA is conserved from human to
chicken. Pull-down assays revealed that MIR137 interacted with ARGO2
(EIF2C2; 606229) and CTBP1 mRNA. Cotransfection of MIR137 inhibited
expression of a reporter gene containing the CTBP1 3-prime UTR, but not
when the MIR137-binding site was deleted from the CTBP1 3-prime UTR.
Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that MIR137
expression in a melanoma cell line reduced CTBP1 protein levels and
increased expression of the CTBP1 target genes E-cadherin and BAX
(600040).

MAPPING

By PCR of a radiation hybrid panel, Katsanis and Fisher (1998) mapped
the CTBP1 gene to 4p16.
