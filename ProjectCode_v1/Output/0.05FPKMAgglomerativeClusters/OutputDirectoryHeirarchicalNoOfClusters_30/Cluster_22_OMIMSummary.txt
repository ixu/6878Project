;;APRIL;;
TNF- AND APOL-RELATED LEUKOCYTE EXPRESSED LIGAND 2; TALL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands play
important roles in various physiologic and pathologic processes,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death, and modulation
of immune responses. By screening EST databases, Hahne et al. (1998)
cloned a novel TNF cDNA, TNFSF13, which they called APRIL, for 'a
proliferation-inducing ligand.' The full-length cDNA TNFSF13 clone
encodes a 250-amino acid protein with a predicted 28-amino acid
cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and an
extracellular domain of 201 amino acids with no signal peptide. There is
only 1 N-linked glycosylation site. The sequence of the extracellular
domain shows 21% homology with TNFSF6 (134638) and 20% homology with
TNFA (191160). Northern blot analysis revealed weak expression
restricted to a few tissues: transcripts of 2.1 and 2.4 kb in prostate
and a transcript of 1.8 kb in peripheral blood leukocytes. All tumor
cell lines, however, strongly expressed the TNFSF13 2.1-kb transcript,
and expression of extracellular or full-length TNFSF13 led to increased
proliferation of various cell lines.

Shu et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they designated TALL2.
TALL2 shares about 35% sequence identity with TALL1 (BLYS, or TNFSF13B;
603969) in the C terminus.

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK (TNFSF12; 602695) to exons 2 through 6 of
APRIL. See 602695 for further information on the protein encoded by the
TWEAK/APRIL transcript, which Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) called
TWEPRIL.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Seyler et al. (2005) analyzed synovial tissue specimens from 72 patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (180300) for TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B production
and TNFSF13/TNFSF13B receptor expression. Synovitis with ectopic
germinal centers present had the highest levels of TNFSF13, produced
exclusively by CD83 (604534)-positive dendritic cells; TNFSF13B was
present in similar levels in all types of synovitis (with or without
germinal centers or T cell-B cell aggregates) and was produced
exclusively from CD68 (153634)-positive macrophages. In synovitis with
germinal centers, inhibiting TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B with a TACI
(TNFRSF13B; 604907):Fc fusion protein resulted in destruction of the
germinal centers and marked inhibition of IFN-gamma (147570) and Ig
transcription, whereas similar inhibition in the aggregate and diffuse
types of synovitis enhanced IFN-gamma production and did not affect Ig
levels. These differential immunomodulatory effects correlated with the
presence of TACI-positive T cells in aggregate and diffuse synovitis and
their absence in synovitis with germinal centers. Seyler et al. (2005)
proposed that TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B regulate B-cell as well as T-cell
function and have both pro- and antiinflammatory effects in rheumatoid
arthritis.

Both BLYS and APRIL have been described as homotrimeric molecules, a
feature common to many members of the TNF superfamily. Using ELISA
analysis, Roschke et al. (2002) found that patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700), rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, psoriatic
arthritis (see 607507), polymyositis (see 160750), and ankylosing
spondylitis (106300) had significantly higher levels of BLYS/APRIL
heterotrimers than did controls. Roschke et al. (2002) proposed that
BLYS/APRIL heterotrimers may play a role in rheumatic and other
autoimmune diseases, and that other members of the TNF ligand
superfamily may also form active soluble heterotrimers.

Using cell-based, biochemical, and structural studies, Hymowitz et al.
(2005) characterized interactions between APRIL and TACI. They found
that the short isoform of human TACI, which lacks cysteine-rich domain-1
(CRD1), was still functional for signaling and that CRD2 of TACI was
sufficient for high-affinity binding to either murine April or human
BAFF (TNFSF13B). The solution structure of CRD2 of TACI revealed a
compact domain and additional ligand-binding determinants. Cocrystal
structures of murine April bound to CRD2 of human TACI or to human BCMA
(TNFRSF17; 109545) showed large interfaces and revealed key differences
that likely influence ligand-binding affinity and specificity.

Ingold et al. (2005) showed that the TNF homology domain of mouse and
human APRIL bound BCMA and TACI, whereas a basic sequence (QKQKKQ) close
to the N terminus of the mature protein bound negatively charged
sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Although T-cell
lines bound little APRIL, ectopic expression of glycosaminoglycan-rich
syndecans (see SDC1; 186355) or glypicans (see GPC1; 600395) conferred
on these cells a high binding capacity that was completely dependent on
the N-terminal basic sequence of APRIL. Moreover, SDC1-positive plasma
cells and proteoglycan-rich nonhematopoietic cells displayed high
specific, heparin-sensitive binding to APRIL. Inhibition of BAFF and
APRIL, but not BAFF alone, prevented survival and/or migration of newly
formed plasma cells to bone marrow. In addition, costimulation of B-cell
proliferation by APRIL was only effective upon APRIL oligomerization.
Ingold et al. (2005) proposed that APRIL binding to the extracellular
matrix or to proteoglycan-positive cells induces APRIL oligomerization,
which is the prerequisite for triggering TACI- and/or BCMA-mediated
activation, migration, and survival signals.

Using flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemical
analysis, Huard et al. (2008) found that APRIL was expressed on
recruited neutrophils and accumulated on subepithelial heparan sulfate
proteoglycans in upper (e.g., tonsils) and lower (e.g., lamina propria)
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and contributed to survival of
plasma cells. Mice lacking April had less-persistent mucosal humoral
immunity. Huard et al. (2008) proposed that inflammation-recruited
neutrophils may create plasma cell niches in MALT to sustain local
antibody production.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF13 gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the transcriptional start
site of the TNFSF13 gene lies 878 bp downstream of the TNFSF12 gene on
chromosome 17p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

By treating mice with TACI-Ig, Gross et al. (2001) determined that BLYS
and APRIL are required for the development of both transitional (T2) and
mature B lymphocytes. TACI-Ig-treated mice also had less circulating
immunoglobulin and produced less collagen-specific antibody. TACI-Ig
treatment inhibited the development of collagen-induced rheumatoid
arthritis. Gross et al. (2001) proposed that TACI-Ig may have a role in
both the prevention and treatment of autoimmune disease mediated by
pathogenic autoantibodies.

Stein et al. (2002) created mice expressing human APRIL as a transgene
in T cells. These mice appeared normal. Transgenic T cells showed
enhanced survival in vitro and enhanced survival of staphylococcal
enterotoxin B-reactive Cd4-positive T cells in vivo, and both of these
responses correlated with elevated Bcl2 levels. Analysis of humoral
responses to T cell-dependent antigens in the transgenic mice indicated
that APRIL affected IgM responses, but not IgG responses. In contrast, T
cell-independent type-2 (TI-2) humoral responses were enhanced in APRIL
transgenic mice. As TACI had been reported to be indispensable for TI-2
antibody formation, Stein et al. (2002) concluded that APRIL-TACI
interactions have a role in generating the TI-2 response and that APRIL
is involved in the induction and/or maintenance of T- and B-cell
responses.

To investigate the role of APRIL in immunity, Castigli et al. (2004)
generated April-deficient mice. April -/- mice had normal T and B
lymphocyte development, normal T and B cell proliferation in vitro, but
increased numbers of CD4+ effector/memory T cells and increased IgG
responses to T-dependent antigens. Serum IgA levels were significantly
decreased, and serum IgA antibody responses to mucosal immunization with
T-dependent antigens and to type 1 T-independent antigens were impaired
in April -/- mice. The results suggested that APRIL downregulates T
cell-dependent antibody responses and promotes IgA class switching.

605276	TITLE *605276 APOPTOSIS-ASSOCIATED TYROSINE KINASE; AATK
;;AATYK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly selecting cDNA clones from size-fractionated human brain
cDNA libraries, Ishikawa et al. (1998) identified a full-length cDNA
clone, which they called KIAA0641, encoding a protein with significant
homology to the mouse Aatyk protein identified by Gaozza et al. (1997).
The deduced human AATK protein contains 1,207 amino acids and has an
observed molecular mass greater than 100 kD. By RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al.
(1998) detected expression of AATK in brain, lung, kidney, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

From studies of the mouse Aatyk gene, Gaozza et al. (1997) hypothesized
that Aatyk is a necessary prerequisite for the induction of growth
arrest and/or apoptosis of myeloid precursor cells. They found that
expression of Aatyk is dramatically upregulated during apoptotic death
of 32D bone marrow-derived cells during IL3 (147740) deprivation as well
as during GCSF (138970)-induced terminal differentiation of 32D cells.
Additionally, the expression of Aatyk is blocked in v-abl or bcr-abl
transformed myeloid cells, which are unable to apoptose when deprived of
IL3.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the AATK
gene to chromosome 17. By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Seki et
al. (1999) refined the localization to 17q25.3

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the sequences of EXT1 (608177), EXT2
(608210), and EXTL1 (601738), followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE,
Saito et al. (1998) cloned full-length cDNAs for 2 new members of the
EXT family, EXTL2 (602411) and EXTL3, which they called EXTR2 and EXTR1,
respectively. The deduced 919-amino acid EXTL3 protein contains a highly
conserved region in the C terminus common to other EXT proteins.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of 6.2- and 4.7-kb EXTR1
transcripts in all tissues tested except ovary. The larger transcript
was predominant in brain, skeletal muscle, and testis, and the shorter
transcript in heart, liver, thymus, and prostate.

Kobayashi et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA for a REG protein (see 167770)
receptor from a rat islet cDNA library. Cells into which the cDNA had
been introduced bound REG protein with high affinity. When the cDNA was
introduced into a pancreatic beta-cell line that showed REG-dependent
growth, the transformants exhibited a significant increase in the
incorporation of 5-prime-bromo-2-prime-deoxyuridine as well as in the
cell numbers in response to REG protein. A homology search revealed that
the rat REG protein receptor cDNA is a homolog of EXTL3. The rat and
human proteins share 97% sequence identity. Kobayashi et al. (2000)
found that REG receptor mRNA in the rat is detectable in liver, kidney,
stomach, small intestine, colon, adrenal gland, pituitary gland, and
brain, but not in heart, suggesting the possible involvement of the
REG-REG protein receptor signal system in a variety of cell types other
than pancreatic beta cells.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Saito et al.
(1998) mapped the human EXTL3 gene to chromosome 8p21. By FISH,
radiation hybrid analysis, and inclusion within a mapped contig, Van Hul
et al. (1998) mapped the gene to 8p21-p12.

;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 30; GPR30;;
CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR-LIKE 2; CMKRL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Owman et al. (1996) performed PCR of template DNA from human B-cell
lymphoblasts using degenerate primers to G protein-coupled receptors.
They identified a full-length cDNA encoding a 375-amino acid protein,
which they termed CMKRL2. CMKRL2 is expressed in the Burkitt lymphoma
cell lines Raji and Daudi but not in T-cell lymphoma Jurkat cells, T- or
B-cell leukemias, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or other cancer cell
lines (Owman et al., 1996). Northern blot analysis of normal tissue
showed expression of a 2.4-kb transcript in many tissues including the
brain; there was no detectable mRNA in placenta, bone marrow, or
peripheral blood leukocytes (Owman et al., 1996).

Using the technique of differential cDNA library screening to identify
genes overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ESR)-positive breast carcinoma
cell lines compared to ESR-negative cell lines, Carmeci et al. (1997)
isolated a CMKRL2 cDNA and designated it GPR30. Sequence analysis
determined that the clone shares significant homology to G
protein-coupled receptors. This receptor was abundantly expressed in 3
ESR-positive breast carcinoma cell lines. Expression was absent or
minimal in 3 ESR-negative breast carcinoma cell lines. It was
ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues examined, but was most
abundant in placenta. In 11 primary breast carcinomas, it was detected
in all 4 ESR-positive tumors and in only 1 of 7 ESR-negative tumors. The
pattern of expression of the gene indicated that the receptor may be
involved in physiologic responses specific to hormonally responsive
tissues.

Using PCR with degenerate primers to identify novel members of the G
protein-coupled receptor family, Feng and Gregor (1997) also cloned
GPR30. They designated the gene CEPR for 'constitutively/commonly
expressed peptide-like receptor' because the 3.3-kb mRNA was detected in
most human tissues on Northern blots. They found that CEPR is encoded by
an intronless gene. Similarly, Kvingedal and Smeland (1997) cloned GPR30
using RT-PCR of B-cell mRNA to identify G protein-coupled receptors
expressed in lymphocytes. They designated the gene LyGPR for
'lymphocyte-derived G protein-coupled receptor.' Takada et al. (1997)
cloned GPR30 from endothelial cells exposed to fluid shear stress. They
designated the gene FEG1 for 'flow-induced endothelial G protein-coupled
receptor gene-1.'

GENE FUNCTION

Revankar et al. (2005) found that unlike other known G protein-coupled
receptors, GPR30 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it
specifically binds estrogen and estrogen derivatives. Activating GPR30
by estrogen resulted in intracellular calcium mobilization and synthesis
of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the nucleus. Revankar et
al. (2005) concluded that GPR30 represents an intracellular
transmembrane estrogen receptor that may contribute to normal estrogen
physiology as well as pathophysiology. Pietras et al. (2005) questioned
the conclusions raised by Revankar et al. (2005); Prossnitz et al.
(2005) provided a response.

MAPPING

Owman et al. (1996) mapped the CMKRL2 gene to 7p22 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Based upon PCR analysis in somatic hybrid cell
lines, Carmeci et al. (1997) mapped the GPR30 gene to 7p22.

300512	TITLE *300512 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 13; WDR13
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human testis cDNA library, Singh et al. (2003) cloned
WDR13. The deduced 485-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 53 kD. The N-terminal domain of WDR13 contains several consensus
phosphorylation sites, and the C terminus contains 6 WD repeats. Singh
et al. (2003) also identified a splice variant that encodes a 393-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 43 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of transcripts at about 3.0 and
2.0 kb in all tissues examined. RNA dot blot analysis confirmed
widespread expression in adult and fetal tissues. Transfection of the
WDR13 splice variants in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated
expression of the 53-kD isoform in the nucleus and expression of the
43-kD isoform in both cytoplasm and nucleus.

613358	TITLE *613358 ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 16 FAMILY, MEMBER A1; ALDH16A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mass spectrometry to identify proteins that coimmunoprecipitated
with maspardin (ACP33; 608181) from HeLa cell lysates, followed by
database analysis, Hanna and Blackstone (2009) identified ALDH16A1.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected a punctate cytoplasmic ALDH16A1
distribution in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis showed that the
protein had an apparent molecular mass of 85 kD. RT-PCR detected
Aldh16a1 in mouse brain. In situ hybridization of cultured mouse
cortical neurons revealed prominent punctate Aldh16a1 staining in cell
bodies and growth cones.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays, Hanna
and Blackstone (2009) showed that endogenous maspardin and ALDH16A1
interacted directly.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ALDH16A1 gene to chromosome 19q13.33 based on an
alignment of the ALDH16A1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY007096) with the
genomic sequence (GRCH37).

142810	TITLE *142810 HISTIDYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; HARS
;;HRS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HARS catalyzes the covalent ligation of histidine to its cognate tRNA as
an early step in protein biosynthesis (O'Hanlon and Miller, 2002).

CLONING

O'Hanlon et al. (1995) noted that HARS and HARS2 (600783), which they
called HO3, are oriented in a head-to-head configuration and share a
bidirectional promoter. They reported that the deduced 509-amino acid
HARS protein shares 72% amino acid identity with HARS2. Both proteins
contain 3 motifs conserved among class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and
2 signature regions of histidyl-tRNA synthetases. However, HARS and
HARS2 have divergent N-terminal domains that are encoded by the first 2
exons of each gene. HARS has a calculated molecular mass of 57.4 kD.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb HARS transcript that was highly
expressed in heart, brain, liver, and kidney.

Using 5-prime RACE with a human kidney cDNA library, O'Hanlon and Miller
(2002) identified several HARS transcripts that differed only in the
lengths of their 5-prime UTRs. O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) noted that
pufferfish and human HARS proteins share 84% amino acid homology,
suggesting a high degree of conservation.

GENE STRUCTURE

O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) determined that the HARS gene contains 13
exons and spans approximately 17.4 kb. The HARS and HARS2 genes share a
bidirectional promoter that lacks TATA and CAAT boxes. Both genes use
multiple transcriptional start sites. HARS also uses a second, more
distal promoter that overlaps the first exons of the HARS2 gene.

MAPPING

Carlock et al. (1985) used a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line with
mutations in 3 genes, HARS, RPS14 (130620) and CHR (118840), in
interspecies cell hybridization experiments, to assign the HARS gene to
chromosome 5. Wasmuth and Carlock (1986) assigned the HARS gene to
chromosome 5 by use of human-Chinese hamster ovary cell hybrids.

By genomic sequence analysis, O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) mapped the HARS
and HARS2 genes to chromosome 5q31.3. HARS and HARS2 exhibit a
head-to-head orientation, with 344 bp separating their ORFs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients from Old Order Amish families in Pennsylvania with Usher
syndrome type III mapping to chromosome 5q (USH3B; 614504), Puffenberger
et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the
HARS gene (Y454S; 142810.0001) that was not found in dbSNP 129 or the
1000 Genomes Project. In addition, an Old Order Amish patient from an
unrelated deme in Ontario, Canada, had an identical phenotype and was
homozygous for the same mutation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIB
HARS, TYR454SER

In 2 patients from Old Order Amish families in Pennsylvania with Usher
syndrome type IIIB (USH3B; 614504), Puffenberger et al. (2012)
identified homozygosity for a 1361A-C transversion in the HARS gene,
resulting in a tyr454-to-ser (Y454S) substitution in the interface
between the catalytic domain and the anticodon binding domain. A patient
with an identical phenotype from an unrelated Old Order Amish deme in
Ontario, Canada, was also homozygous for the Y454S mutation. The variant
was not found in dbSNP 129 or the 1000 Genomes Project; it was, however,
detected in 7 of 406 Old Order Amish alleles, for a population-specific
allele frequency of 1.72%. (Puffenberger (2012) stated that the correct
population-specific allele frequency data appear in Table 4;
corresponding data in the text are incorrect.)

.0002
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
HARS, ARG137GLN (dbSNP rs191391414)

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to a peripheral neuropathy has not been confirmed.

In a 64-year-old man with a 15-year history of impaired sensation in the
lower extremities and electrophysiologic studies suggestive of an axonal
peripheral neuropathy, Vester et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous
410G-A transition (dbSNP rs191391414) in the HARS gene, resulting in an
arg137-to-gln (R137Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
catalytic core of the enzyme. The patient was ascertained from a larger
cohort of 363 individuals with peripheral neuropathy. The R137Q variant
was also found in 3 of over 13,000 control chromosomes. One of the
control carriers had no evidence of neuropathy at age 57 years.
Generation of a yeast strain with deletion of the Hst1 gene (the
ortholog of HARS) showed that the R137Q variant could not complement the
Hst1 deletion, suggesting that it is a loss-of-function allele.
Expression of the R137Q variant specifically in GABA motor nerves of C.
elegans caused gross morphologic defects in commissural axons, with
failure to reach the dorsal nerve cord, axonal beading, defasciculation,
and breaks in the nerve cord. The animals with the variant also showed
locomotor defects. Vester et al. (2013) concluded that the HARS R137Q
variant may be a pathogenic allele that predisposes to the development
of peripheral neuropathy, similar to other ARS mutations (see, e.g.,
GARS, 600287), but noted that a causal link remains unclear.

602352	TITLE *602352 GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE 2; GNRH2
DESCRIPTION Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GNRH1; 152760) is a decapeptide widely
known for its role in regulating reproduction by serving as a signal
from the hypothalamus to pituitary gonadotropes. This function for GNRH1
has been highly conserved during 500 million years of vertebrate
evolution despite the fact that its amino acid sequence varies by 50%.
In addition to the hypothalamic GNRH1 of variable sequence, many
vertebrate species express a second, invariant GNRH form, GNRH-II (or
GNRH2), with the primary structure
gln-his-trp-ser-his-gly-trp-tyr-pro-gly. Antibody staining demonstrates
GNRH2 in the midbrain of all species where its location has been
described (Kasten et al., 1996). Furthermore, nucleic acid probes have
been used to identify GNRH2 expression in the midbrain of several fish
species and one mammal. White et al. (1998) showed that a gene encoding
GNRH2 is expressed in humans and is located on chromosome 20p13,
distinct from the GNRH1 gene on 8p21-p11.2. The genomic and mRNA
structures of GNRH2 parallel those of GNRH1. However, in contrast to
GNRH1, GNRH2 is expressed at significantly higher levels outside the
brain (up to 30-fold), particularly in the kidney, bone marrow, and
prostate. The widespread expression of GNRH2 suggests it may have
multiple functions. Molecular phylogenetic analysis shows that GNRH2 is
likely the result of a duplication before the appearance of vertebrates,
and predicts the existence of a third GNRH form in humans and other
vertebrates. White et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization
to map GNRH2 to 20p13.

Chen et al. (2002) found that human normal and leukemic T cells produce
GNRH2 and GNRH1. Exposure of normal or cancerous human or mouse T cells
to GNRH2 or GNRH1 triggered de novo gene transcription and cell-surface
expression of the laminin receptor (150370), which is involved in
cellular adhesion and migration and in tumor invasion and metastasis.
GNRH2 or GNRH1 also induced adhesion to laminin and chemotaxis toward
SDF1A (600835), and augmented entry in vivo of metastatic T-lymphoma
into the spleen and bone marrow. Homing of normal T cells into specific
organs was reduced in mice lacking GNRH1. A specific GNRH1 receptor
antagonist blocked GNRH1 but not GNRH2-induced effects, which was
suggestive of signaling through distinct receptors. Chen et al. (2002)
suggested that GNRH2 and GNRH1, secreted from nerves or autocrine or
paracrine sources, interact directly with T cells and trigger gene
transcription, adhesion, chemotaxis, and homing to specific organs.

603002	TITLE *603002 TRANSPORTIN 2; TNPO2
;;TRN2;;
KARYOPHERIN BETA-2B; KPNB2B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transportin-1 (KPNB2; 602901) interacts directly and specifically with
M9, the bidirectional transport signal of the nuclear shuttling protein
hnRNPA1 (164017) and mediates hnRNPA1 nuclear import. In the course of
isolating additional transportin-1 cDNAs, Siomi et al. (1997) isolated
cDNAs encoding a related protein that they designated 'transportin-2.'
The sequence of the predicted 894-amino acid protein shares 84% identity
with that of transportin-1. One notable difference is that transportin-2
contains a short extra sequence within the region corresponding to the
M9-interacting domain of transportin-1. Far Western blotting showed that
transportin-2 and transportin-1 have different substrate specificities.
Siomi et al. (1997) suggested that the insert in transportin-2 modifies
its interaction with import substrates.

GENE FUNCTION

Transport of macromolecules between the cell nucleus and cytoplasm
occurs through the nuclear pores and is mediated by soluble carriers
known as karyopherins, transportins, importins, or exportins. Shamsher
et al. (2002) found that transportin-2 forms complexes with the mRNA
export factor TAP (NXF1; 602647) that strictly depend on the presence of
RanGTP. The data supported the conclusion that transportin-2
participates directly in the export of a large proportion of cellular
mRNAs, and that TAP connects transportin-2 to mRNAs to be exported.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRN2
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP WI-30101).

305360	TITLE *305360 MEMBRANE PROTEIN, PALMITOYLATED 1; MPP1
;;ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN p55; EMP55;;
PALMITOYLATED ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN; PEMP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EMP55 is the prototype of a family of membrane-associated proteins
termed MAGUKs (membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs). MAGUKs
interact with the cytoskeleton and regulate cell proliferation,
signaling pathways, and intracellular junctions (Kim et al., 1996).

CLONING

Ruff et al. (1991) deduced the complete amino acid sequence of a 55-kD
erythrocyte membrane protein from cDNA clones isolated from a human
reticulocyte library. This protein, p55, was copurified during the
isolation of dematin, an actin-bundling protein of the erythrocyte
membrane cytoskeleton. Its tight association with the plasma membrane
was reminiscent of an integral membrane protein. Protein p55 is the most
extensively palmitoylated protein of the erythrocyte membrane. Predicted
primary structure of p55 contained a conserved sequence, called the SH3
(src homology 3) motif, found in several other proteins that associate
with the cytoskeleton and are suspected to play important roles in
signal transduction.

Metzenberg and Gitschier (1992) found a gene located in a CpG island 30
kb 3-prime to the factor VIII gene (F8; 300841). The 2-kb transcript
encoded a previously described palmitoylated membrane protein, p55,
containing an src homology motif, SH3. Although originally described in
reticulocytes (Ruff et al., 1991), Metzenberg and Gitschier (1992) found
that the transcript was expressed in a wide variety of human tissues.
The gene was also found in the mouse where it was expressed in all
tissues examined. The EMP55 gene did not appear to be developmentally
regulated in erythrocytes; p55 is constitutively and abundantly
expressed in erythroid cells during their development from stem cells to
fully differentiated reticulocytes. In contrast, other red cell
membrane-associated proteins such as 4.1, ankyrin, and band 3 are
expressed late in erythropoiesis. These results suggested that the p55
protein may have a housekeeping function. Other work indicated that it
is a peripheral membrane protein. Bryant and Woods (1992) demonstrated
that p55 is homologous to the yeast guanylate kinase and to the product
of a Drosophila tumor suppressor gene.

Elder et al. (1996) cloned and sequenced the mouse MPP1 gene. The mouse
gene shares 89% sequence identity with the coding sequence of human
MPP1. The coding region size and intron/exon structures of the mouse and
human genes are identical. The human and mouse sequences and structures
are highly homologous to the MPP1 gene of fish (Fugu), suggesting that
the gene serves an essential function in development.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse embryo cDNA library, Mburu et al.
(2006) found that whirlin (WHRN; 607928) interacted with p55. p55 was
expressed in mouse outer hair cells in long stereocilia that made up the
stereocilia bundle and in surrounding shorter stereocilia structures.
Since p55 and protein 4.1R (EPB41; 130500) form complexes critical for
actin cytoskeletal assembly in erythrocytes, Mburu et al. (2006)
proposed that p55 and whirlin may have a similar role in hair cell
stereocilia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Metzenberg and Gitschier (1992) estimated that the EMP55 gene spans 20
to 30 kb.

Kim et al. (1996) reported the complete intron/exon map of the human
erythroid p55 gene. The structure of the p55 gene was determined from
cosmid clones isolated from a cosmid library specific for the human X
chromosome. There is a single copy of the p55 gene, composed of 12 exons
and spanning approximately 28 kb in the Xq28 region. Several of the exon
boundaries corresponded to the boundaries of functional domains in the
p55 protein. These domains include an SH3 motif and a region that binds
to cytoskeletal protein 4.1.

MAPPING

Metzenberg and Gitschier (1992) identified the EMP55 gene in a CpG
island 30 kb 3-prime to the factor VIII gene (300841). They confirmed
the Xq28 localization of the EMP55 gene by study of hybrid cell lines
containing various parts of the human X chromosome in rodent
backgrounds. They proved that the gene is located between the F8 and
glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; 305900) genes by hybridization
to a YAC clone that extends approximately 60 kb beyond the F8C gene. The
EMP55 gene appeared to be transcribed in the same direction as F8C. No
known factor VIII gene deletions extended into the EMP55 gene. Since the
function of the p55 protein was not known, the gene was formally a
candidate for any of the many disease genes that are closely linked
genetically to the F8C gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Metzenberg et al. (1994) failed to find evidence of mutation in the
EMP55 gene in either of 2 disorders that on the grounds of phenotype and
map location are candidate disorders: dyskeratosis congenita (305000)
and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300).

Liu et al. (1997) reported a method of determination of clonality using
allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) to detect exonic polymorphisms in p55 and
G6PD (305900). They demonstrated a significant sex difference in allele
frequencies in African Americans but not in Caucasians, and linkage
disequilibrium for the p55 and G6PD alleles in Caucasians but not in
African Americans.

605213	TITLE *605213 3-@PHOSPHOINOSITIDE-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 1; PDPK1
;;PDK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Isoforms of protein kinase B (PKB, or AKT1; 164730) are overexpressed in
some ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancer cells, and PKB has been
shown to protect cells from apoptosis. Activation of PKB, which is
preventable by inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (see PIK3CG;
601232), is stimulated by insulin or growth factors after
phosphorylation of PKB at thr308 and ser473. Alessi et al. (1997)
biochemically purified a protein kinase, which they called PDK1, that
phosphorylates PKB at thr308 in response to phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) or phosphatidylinositol
3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and enhances PKB activity. By
microsequence analysis of the approximately 67- to 69-kD PDK1 protein,
searching an EST database, and probing a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Alessi et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding PDK1, also called
PDPK1. Sequence analysis predicted that the 556-amino acid PDPK1 protein
contains a catalytic domain with 11 classic kinase subdomains and a
C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Alessi et al. (1997) found that expression of recombinant PDPK1 resulted
in the activation and phosphorylation of PKB at thr308 in a
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3- or PtdIns(3,4)P2-dependent manner via the PH domains.

Stephens et al. (1998) demonstrated that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and
PtdIns(3,4)P2 bind to the PH domains of PKB and PDPK1, causing their
translocation to the membrane and leading to PKB activation.

Pullen et al. (1998) showed that PDPK1 selectively phosphorylates the
70-kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70-RPS6K) at thr229, which is
required for its activation. Thr229 of p70-RPS6K is homologous to thr308
of the PKB protein.

Using transfected HEK293 cells stimulated with pervanadate or insulin,
Park et al. (2001) found that PDK1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and
translocates to the plasma membrane. Following pervanadate treatment,
PDK1 kinase activity increased 1.5- to 3-fold, whereas the activity of
PDK1 associated with the plasma membrane increased approximately 6-fold.
The activity localized to the plasma membrane was also increased by
insulin treatment. Using site-directed mutants, they determined that
phosphorylation of tyr373/tyr376 is important for PDK1 activity.

Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011) after
engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) is important for T cell
proliferation and activation during the adaptive immune response. Lee et
al. (2005) demonstrated that PDK1 has an essential role in this pathway
by regulating the activation of PKC-theta (PRKCQ; 600448) and through
signal-dependent recruiting of both PKC-theta and CARD11 (607210) to
lipid rafts. PDK1-associated PKC-theta recruits the IKK complex, whereas
PDK1-associated CARD11 recruits the Bcl10-MALT1 complex (see 604860),
thereby allowing activation of the IKK complex through
Bcl10-MALT1-dependent ubiquitination of the IKK complex subunit NEMO
(300248). Lee et al. (2005) concluded that PDK1 plays a critical role by
nucleating the TCR-induced NF-kappa-B activation pathway in T cells.

Gruber et al. (2006) commented on the study of Lee et al. (2005),
stating they observed that PKC-theta is phosphorylated on the activation
loop at thr538 before T cell activation. The results of Gruber et al.
(2006) are therefore inconsistent with the conclusions of Lee et al.
(2005) that thr538 phosphorylation of PKC-theta is regulated by T-cell
receptor activation. They postulated that other mechanisms, such as
autophosphorylation of thr219, might orchestrate the cellular function
of PKC-theta in T cells. Lee et al. (2006) responded to the comments of
Gruber et al. (2006) to state that several other groups have replicated
their data regarding inducible phosphorylation of thr538 in T cells. Lee
et al. (2006) noted that although the physiologic relevance of the
discrepancy is unclear, substantial differences and experimental
conditions and reagents may have accounted for the conflicting
observations.

In 3-dimensional matrices, cancer cells move with a rounded, amoeboid
morphology that is controlled by ROCK1-dependent contraction of
actomyosin. Using human cancer cell lines, Pinner and Sahai (2008)
showed that PDK1 was required for phosphorylation of myosin light chain
(see 160780) and cell motility, both on deformable gels and in vivo.
Depletion of PDK1 via RNA interference altered the localization of ROCK1
and reduced its ability to drive cortical actomyosin contraction. This
form of ROCK1 regulation did not require PDK1 kinase activity. Instead,
PDK1 competed directly with RHOE (RND3; 602924) for binding to ROCK1 and
opposed inhibition of ROCK1 by RHOE.

MAPPING

Alessi et al. (1997) and Stephens et al. (1998) mapped the PDPK1 gene to
16p13.3 based on its identity to a sequence located in the same region
as the PKD1 (601313) and TSC2 (191092) loci (Burn et al., 1996).

ANIMAL MODEL

Lawlor et al. (2002) found that Pdk1-null mice died at embryonic day 9.5
with multiple abnormalities, including lack of somites, forebrain, and
neural crest-derived tissues. Development of hind- and midbrain,
however, proceeded relatively normally. Lawlor et al. (2002) developed a
mouse strain that showed reduced levels of Pdk1 activity. These
hypomorphic Pdk1 mice were viable and fertile, and insulin injection
induced the normal phosphorylation responses attributed to Pdk1
activation. Nevertheless, these mice were 40 to 50% smaller than control
animals. The organ volumes from the Pdk1 hypomorphic mice were reduced
proportionally, and the volume of a number of Pdk1-deficient cells was
reduced by 35 to 60%. Pdk1 deficiency seemed to regulate cell size
directly and independently of cell number or proliferation rate.

The PDK1 'master kinase' mediates activation of AGC serine kinases (PKA,
PKG, and PKC (see 176960)) by phosphorylating them at the 'T-loop' site
of their catalytic domains. In order to determine the role of AGC serine
kinases in T-cell development, Hinton et al. (2004) used conditional
gene deletion of Pdk1 in mouse T cells to avoid embryonic lethality.
Complete loss of Pdk1 blocked T-cell differentiation in thymus, whereas
reducing Pdk1 activity to 10% of normal allowed differentiation to
proceed but blocked thymic expansion.

Hashimoto et al. (2006) investigated the role of PDK1, a
serine-threonine kinase, in regulating islet mass via a signaling
pathway that includes INSR (147670) or IGF1R (147370), IRS1 (147545),
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Hashimoto et al. (2006) showed
that mice lacking Pdk1 specifically in pancreatic beta cells developed
progressive hyperglycemia as a result of loss of islet mass. The mice
showed reductions in islet density as well as in number and size of beta
cells. Haploinsufficiency of the Foxo1 gene (136533) resulted in a
marked increase in the number, but not the size, of beta cells and
resulted in restoration of glucose homeostasis in beta cell-specific
Pdk1-null mice. Hashimoto et al. (2006) suggested that PDK1 is important
in maintenance of pancreatic beta cell mass and glucose homeostasis.

In mice lacking Pdk1 in oocytes, Reddy et al. (2009) demonstrated that
the majority of primordial follicles were depleted around the onset of
sexual maturity, causing premature ovarian failure (POF) during early
adulthood. Suppressed PDK1-Akt1 (164730)-S6K1 (RPS6KB1; 608938)-RPS6
(180460) signaling in oocytes appeared to be responsible for the loss of
primordial follicles, and mice lacking the Rps6 gene in oocytes showed
POF similar to that in Pdk1-deficient mice. Reddy et al. (2009)
concluded that the PI3K/PTEN (601728)-PDK1 signaling pathway in oocytes
controls the survival, loss, and activation of primordial follicles
(which together determine reproductive aging and the length of
reproductive life in females), and that underactivation or
overactivation of the pathway in oocytes may cause POF and infertility.

611982	TITLE *611982 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S18B; MRPS18B
;;MRPS18-2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS18B
is a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS18B, which they called MRPS18-2. The deduced
MRPS18B protein contains 258 amino acids and has a calculated molecular
mass of 29.3 kD. Removal of a predicted 25-amino acid N-terminal
mitochondrial localization signal results in a mature 26.5-kD protein.
Koc et al. (2001) noted that 1 Mrps18 protein is present in E. coli,
whereas other organisms contain several Mrps18 orthologs. Humans have 3
MRPS18 proteins, MRPS18A (611981), MRPS18B, and MRPS18C (611983), that
share sequence conservation only in their central regions. Mouse and
human MRPS18B share 78.4% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003) mapped the
MRPS18B gene to chromosome 6p21.3. They identified MRPS18B pseudogenes
on chromosomes 1 and 2.

613110	TITLE *613110 BLADDER CANCER-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; BLCAP
;;BLADDER CANCER-ASSOCIATED, 10-KD; BC10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The BLCAP gene is a tumor suppressor that limits cell proliferation and
stimulates apoptosis. BLCAP protein or message is downregulated or
absent in a variety of human cancers (Schulz et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using differential display to identify genes upregulated in tumor
biopsies obtained from a noninvasive compared with invasive bladder
transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs), Gromova et al. (1999) identified
BLCAP, which they designated BC10. Gromova et al. (2002) cloned
full-length BC10 from a cDNA library developed from a noninvasive TCC.
The deduced 87-amino acid peptide has a calculated molecular mass of 9.8
kD. It has an N-terminal cytoplasmic region, followed by a proline-rich
region with characteristics of the SRC (190090) homology-3
domain-binding site, 2 highly hydrophobic regions, and a C terminus with
a putative casein kinase II (see CSNK2A1, 115440) phosphorylation site.
Human and mouse BC10 share 100% amino acid identity, and the
corresponding transcripts share 95% nucleotide identity in the coding
region. Close orthologs were also detected in nematode and fly,
suggesting a high degree of conservation. Northern blot analysis
detected a transcript of about 2 kb in noninvasive TCC. Two-dimensional
separation of proteins in BC10-expressing COS cells, followed by Western
blot analysis, revealed a major acidic form of BC10, and a minor basic
form of BC10, both at an apparent molecular mass of 10 kD. The acidic
form is likely phosphorylated.

Schulz et al. (2009) identified at least 4 distinct human BLCAP
transcripts and 2 distinct mouse transcripts. They referred to BLCAP
transcripts with translation start sites downstream of NNAT (603106),
which is within intron 1 of BLCAP, as BLCAP-V1A, -V1B, and -V1C, and
they referred to the BLCAP transcript with translation start site
upstream of NNAT as BLCAP-V2A.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR, Gromova et al. (2002) confirmed
that the expression of BLCAP was downregulated in invasive bladder TCCs.

Yao et al. (2007) stated that expression of BLCAP is downregulated in
several types of carcinomas and overexpression of BLCAP in HeLa cells
induces apoptosis. They found that BLCAP overexpression in a human
tongue carcinoma cell line induced S phase arrest and apoptosis,
accompanied by upregulation of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and downregulation
of BCL2 (151430) and BCLXL (BCL2L1; 600039).

GENE STRUCTURE

Schulz et al. (2009) noted that the BLCAP gene consists of 2 exons
traversing approximately 13 kb, with evidence for 2 alternative exons
resulting in minor splice variants. In mouse and human, the first intron
of the BLCAP gene contains the distinct neuronatin (NNAT; 603106) gene,
which is an imprinted gene exclusively expressed from the paternally
inherited allele.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gromova et al. (2002) mapped the BLCAP
gene to chromosome 20q11.2-q12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schulz et al. (2009) found that mouse Blcap-v1 transcripts were
preferentially expressed from maternally-inherited alleles in adult and
fetal brain but not in other murine tissues, and likewise human BLCAP-V1
transcripts showed similar preferential expression from
maternally-inherited alleles in adult and fetal brain. Mouse and human
BLCAP-V2A transcripts were found predominantly expressed from
paternally-inherited alleles in brain. They proposed that the
tissue-specific imprinting of BLCAP may be due to the particularly high
transcriptional activity of NNAT in brain. Schulz et al. (2009)
hypothesized that the imprinted expression of BLCAP and its interplay
with NNAT at the transcriptional level may be relevant to human
carcinogenesis.

603486	TITLE *603486 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 4; USP4
;;UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE; UNP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs) are a group of deubiquitinating
enzymes that possess 2 signature motifs, the Cys box and the His box
(summary by Frederick et al., 1998).

CLONING

Gupta et al. (1993) isolated mouse cDNAs encoding Unp, a protein similar
to the human TRE oncogene. Using Western blots, Gupta et al. (1994)
found that Unp has an apparent molecular mass of 180 kD. They reported
that overexpression of Unp led to oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3
cells injected into athymic mice.

By screening a human frontal cortex library with a murine Unp cDNA, Gray
et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding human UNP. Analysis of the clones
revealed a large open reading with the potential to encode a protein of
854 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 97 kD. The human and mouse
proteins share 90% sequence identity. Northern blot analysis of primary
lung tumor samples indicated that levels of UNP mRNA were elevated in
small cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas relative to normal adult lung.

Frederick et al. (1998) sequenced additional UNP cDNAs and found several
differences from the sequence reported by Gray et al. (1995), including
2 single nucleotide insertions that increased the length of the
predicted protein, UNPEL (UNP extended, long isoform), to 963 amino
acids. They also recovered cDNAs encoding a shorter isoform designated
UNPES. Both isoforms exhibited deubiquitinating activity. Antibodies
against UNP detected 2 proteins of 105 to 110 kD on Western blots. Using
immunocytochemistry of mammalian cells expressing epitope-tagged UNP and
cell fractionation studies, Frederick et al. (1998) demonstrated that
both isoforms of the human protein are localized primarily in the
cytosol. (In an erratum, Frederick et al. (1998) cited a personal
communication from the Gray laboratory stating that the data in Gupta et
al. (1993) locating Unp in the nuclear fraction of mammalian cell
extracts was apparently in error.) Northern blot analysis revealed UNP
expression as a closely-migrating cluster of mRNAs in all tissues
tested. However, the authors found no evidence for overexpression of UNP
transcripts in cell lines derived from small cell lung carcinomas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Di Fruscio et al. (1998) reported that the mouse Unp gene contains 22
exons distributed over 47 kb. A processed ribosomal S2 pseudogene was
identified in the third intron.

MAPPING

By analysis of an interspecific backcross, Gupta et al. (1993) mapped
the Unp gene to mouse chromosome 9 in a region showing homology of
synteny with human chromosome 3p.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Gray et al. (1995) mapped the
human UNP gene to 3p21.3, a region implicated in neoplasms of the lung.
Using the same technique, Frederick et al. (1998) refined the map
position to 3p21.31.

604839	TITLE *604839 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 6; FKBP6
;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, 36-KD
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050) is a developmental disorder
caused by haploinsufficiency of genes in 7q11.23. The deleted DNA
associated with WBS spans more than 1 Mb. Using an STS that maps close
to the common WBS centromeric deletion breakpoint, Meng et al. (1998)
isolated human testis cDNAs corresponding to a novel gene, FKBP6,
located within the WBS deletion region. The FKBP6 gene has 9 exons and
is oriented in a 5-prime to 3-prime direction from centromere to
telomere. FKBP6 is completely contained within a 35-kb cosmid; the DNA
corresponding to the insert of this cosmid was deleted in 40 of 40 WBS
individuals. The predicted 327-amino acid FKBP6 protein shows structural
homology to FKBP immunophilins, which are cellular receptors for the
immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and rapamycin. FKBP6 contains an
N-terminal FK506-binding peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (rotamase) domain and
3 imperfect C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. Northern
blot analysis detected an approximately 1.6-kb FKBP6 transcript in all
human tissues examined, with exceptionally high expression in testis and
high expression in heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney.

Metcalfe et al. (2005) described a Bulgarian father and son with
Williams-Beuren syndrome who appeared to have a common heterozygous
deletion, confirming the expected dominant transmission and adding to
the few familial cases reported. The deletion included the FKBP6 gene
which has been shown to play a role in homologous chromosome pairing in
meiosis and male fertility in mouse models. Metcalfe et al. (2005)
suggested that haploinsufficiency for FKBP6 does not appear to preclude
male fertility in WBS, although male infertility involving this gene has
the potential to follow the mouse model as a human autosomal recessive
condition.

ANIMAL MODEL

Crackower et al. (2003) showed that Fkbp6 localizes to meiotic
chromosome cores and regions of homologous chromosome synapsis. Targeted
inactivation of Fkbp6 in mice resulted in aspermic males and the absence
of normal pachytene spermatocytes. Moreover, Crackower et al. (2003)
identified the deletion of Fkbp6 exon 8 as the causative mutation in
spontaneously sterile male 'aspermia' (as/as) mutant rats. Loss of Fkbp6
results in abnormal pairing and misalignments between homologous
chromosomes, nonhomologous partner switches, and autosynapsis of X
chromosome cores in meiotic spermatocytes. Fertility and meiosis are
normal in Fkbp6 mutant females. Thus, Crackower et al. (2003) concluded
that Fkbp6 is a component of the synaptonemal complex essential for
sex-specific fertility and for the fidelity of homologous chromosome
pairing in meiosis.

607389	TITLE *607389 SINGLE-STRANDED DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 2; SSBP2
;;SENSOR OF SINGLE-STRANDED DNA COMPLEX, SUBUNIT B2; SOSSB2;;
SOSS COMPLEX, SUBUNIT B2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SSBP2 is a subunit of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding complex
involved in the maintenance of genome stability (Huang et al., 2009).

CLONING

By positional cloning, Castro et al. (2002) identified a novel gene,
which they designated SSBP2, that is disrupted at the 5q13 breakpoint in
the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line ML3. EST database searching
revealed that the transcript is similar to the chicken gene CSDP, which
encodes a protein that binds single-stranded pyrimidine-rich
mirror-repeat elements with high specificity. By further database
searching, they identified 2 additional cDNAs encoding single-stranded
DNA-binding proteins, SSBP3 (607390) and SSBP4 (607391). The deduced
362-amino acid SSBP2 protein shares 83% and 73% sequence identity with
SSBP3 and SSBP4, respectively, and 100% identity with the mouse Ssbp2
homolog. SSBP family members share a highly conserved N terminus
followed by a glycine- and proline-rich domain. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of a 1.9-kb SSBP2 transcript. Expression
was high in all hematopoietic tissues, including spleen, lymph node,
peripheral blood, bone marrow, thymus, and fetal liver, with highest
expression in thymus and fetal liver. Expression was also high in heart,
brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Of 5 leukemia cell lines tested,
expression was highest in pre-T lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CEM. No
gross inactivating mutations were found in leukemia cell lines or in
primary leukemic blasts from 4 patients.

GENE FUNCTION

Using HEK293 cells for tandem affinity purification, Huang et al. (2009)
identified SOSSA (INTS3; 611347) and SOSSC (613273) as common components
of 2 distinct and complementary ssDNA-binding heterotrimeric complexes
defined by their inclusion of either SOSSB1 (SSBP1; 600439) or SOSSB2
(SSBP2), but not both. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that
SOSS complexes formed in HeLa cells independent of DNA damage.
Recombinant heterotrimeric SOSS complexes specifically bound ssDNA, but
not double-stranded DNA. SOSSA served as the central assembly factor,
and SOSSB and SOSSC bound overlapping regions on SOSSA, but they did not
interact directly with each other. Depletion of SOSSA by small
interfering RNA led to dramatic decreases in SOSSB1 and SOSSB2 protein
levels, abrogated targeting of SOSSB1 and SOSSB2 to chromatin, increased
ionizing radiation sensitivity, caused defective G2/M checkpoint, and
impaired homologous recombination repair. Huang et al. (2009)
demonstrated that both SOSS complexes and the CTIP (RBBP8; 604124)/RPA
(see RPA1; 179835) complex acted downstream of the MRE11 (600814)-RAD50
(604040)-NBS1 (NBN; 602667) complex and functioned in DNA damage repair.

GENE STRUCTURE

Castro et al. (2002) determined that the SSBP2, SSBP3, and SSBP4 genes
all contain 17 exons and have identical intron/exon boundaries,
suggesting duplication from a common ancestral gene. They also
identified alternative splicing and additional internal exons for all 3
genes, suggesting the existence of multiple isoforms for each protein.
The SSBP2 gene spans more than 200 kb.

MAPPING

Castro et al. (2002) mapped the SSBP2 gene to chromosome 5q13.3, within
the critical breakpoint region in the AML cell line ML3.

608476	TITLE *608476 TBK1-BINDING PROTEIN 1; TBKBP1
;;PROSAPIP2;;
KIAA0775
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TBKBP1 is an adaptor protein that binds to TBK1 (604834) and is part of
the interaction network in the TNF (191160)/NFKB (see 164011) pathway
(Bouwmeester et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching for sequences with the potential to encode large proteins
expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding
KIAA0775. The predicted protein contains 615 amino acids. RT-PCR
analysis detected ubiquitous expression, with highest levels in ovary,
followed by testis, brain, heart, lung, smooth muscle, kidney, and
liver.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TBKBP1
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP WI-14964).

;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN, SUBFAMILY 1A, MEMBER 1; ZNFN1A1;;
IKAROS; IK1;;
LYF1
IKAROS/BCL6 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ikaros proteins are lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription
factors that are considered master regulators of lymphocyte
differentiation. Klug et al. (1998) noted that there are at least 8
alternatively spliced transcripts of the Ikaros gene that encode
isoforms with common N-terminal and C-terminal domains. By screening a
Jurkat T-cell cDNA library with a mouse Ikaros cDNA, Molnar et al.
(1996) isolated human Ikaros cDNAs. The deduced human and mouse Ikaros
proteins are 95% identical. RT-PCR of human thymus and peripheral blood
leukocyte mRNAs detected 6 Ikaros splicing variants which were expressed
at similar levels and ratios as the corresponding mouse leukocyte Ikaros
transcripts. The authors found that Ikaros proteins are conserved in
sequence composition and relative expression between human T cells and
mouse thymocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of
7.5- and 4.5-kb Ikaros transcripts in human thymus, spleen, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By PCR using primers based on a conserved nucleotide sequence of various
zinc finger proteins, Nietfeld and Meyerhans (1996) cloned human bone
marrow cDNAs encoding Ikaros, which they designated IK1. The deduced
519-amino acid protein is 93% identical to the mouse Ikaros isoform
1/LyF1 isoform VI and contains 4 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal zinc finger
domains. The authors detected 3 human mRNA species by Northern blot
analysis: a 4.4-kb transcript, which was prominent in peripheral blood
leukocytes; a 6.0-kb transcript, which was strongly expressed in spleen,
thymus, lymph node, and bone marrow; and a 7.0-kb transcript. They
stated that the human and mouse Ikaros genes have similar overall
transcription patterns.

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger
domain of Ikaros proteins is involved in DNA binding, while the
C-terminal zinc finger domain mediates homo- or heterodimerization with
other Ikaros proteins. Alternative splicing of exons 3 to 6 produces
Ikaros isoforms with 0 to 4 N-terminal zinc fingers, and those with at
least 3 efficiently bind DNA. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms include
IK1, IK2, IK3, and IKX, and IK4 can bind DNA on palindromic sequences.
IK5, IK6, IK7, and IK8 are considered dominant-negative isoforms due to
their capacity to bind other isoforms and their inefficiency in binding
DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Harker et al. (2002) showed that Ikaros may play an important role in
CD4 (186940) versus CD8 (see CD8A; 186910) lineage commitment decisions
by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements in the
endogenous CD8A locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin
immunoprecipitations; (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect
variegation of transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements; and (3)
that mice with reduced levels of Ikaros and Aiolos (606221) show an
apparent increase in CD4 populations with immature phenotype, i.e.,
cells that fail to activate the CD8A gene. The authors proposed that
Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8A gene and that
their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin
remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage
commitment.

Ezzat et al. (2005) demonstrated that Ikaros is expressed in the
hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells of mice, where it
binds the proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene
expression. Ikaros-null mice had contraction of the pituitary
corticomelanotroph population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic
hormone levels, and adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency. Hematopoietic
reconstitution failed to correct this hormonal deficit, but the
phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished survival was rescued by
systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Ezzat et al. (2005)
concluded that Ikaros plays a role in orchestrating immune-endocrine
development and function.

Yap et al. (2005) identified Ikaros-binding elements in the 5-prime
flanking regions of pufferfish, mouse, and human STAT4 (600558).
Transactivation, electrophoretic mobility shift, and RNA interference
analyses showed that Ikaros bound to the STAT4 promoter and was involved
in regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

Dijon et al. (2008) found that purified CD34 (142230)-positive human
cord blood cells and adult peripheral blood cells that were cultured
under erythroid conditions expressed the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms IK1
through IK4, but not the dominant-negative isoform IK6.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that expression of IK6 in these
cells resulted in complex formation between IK6 and IK1, and IK6
decreased cell number and increased cell death. IK6 overexpression
disturbed erythroid differentiation and expression of erythroid-specific
genes, although it had no effect on Ikaros expression, and favored
myelopoiesis by promoting expression of myeloid-specific genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the IKZF1 gene contains 7 translated
exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Molnar et al. (1996) mapped the human
Ikaros gene to 7p13-p11.1, near the EGFR gene (131550). They mapped the
mouse Ikaros gene to chromosome 11 by interspecific backcross analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ikaros is required for normal lymphocyte development. Germline mutant
mice that express only non-DNA-binding dominant-negative 'leukemogenic'
Ikaros isoforms lacking critical N-terminal zinc fingers develop an
aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia 3 to 6 months after birth (see
'Animal Model' below). These facts prompted Sun et al. (1999) to seek
molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL2; 613067) in infants. In leukemic cells from 12 ALL
infants less than 1 year of age, Sun et al. (1999) found high-level
expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal
subcellular compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide
sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect
Ikaros gene mutations in these cells. Leukemic cells from 7 of 7 infants
with ALL, including 5 of 5 MLL-AF4-positive (159557) infants, expressed
dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms IK4, IK7, and IK8 that lack critical
N-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 7 patients, Sun et al. (1999) detected
an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the
transcription-activation domain adjacent to the C-terminal zinc fingers
of IK2, IK4, IK7, and IK8. In contrast, only wildtype IK1 and IK2
isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in normal infant
bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicated the
expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of
normal Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.

Nakase et al. (2000) found overexpression of the dominant-negative IK6
isoform in 14 of 41 B-cell patients with adult B-cell ALL. None of the
other dominant-negative isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by
RT-PCR analysis. Southern blot analysis with PstI digestion revealed
that those patients with the dominant-negative IK6 isoform might have
small mutations in the Ikaros locus. The results suggested that Ikaros
plays a key role in human B-cell malignancies through the
dominant-negative isoform IK6.

Using RT-PCR to detect Ikaros isoforms with the 30-base deletion in exon
6, Payne et al. (2001) showed that transcripts for IK1 and IK1 with the
deletion were present in normal cord blood and bone marrow, as well as
in 3 ALL cell lines. In addition, they identified an isoform, IKX, that
was identical to IK3 except that it included exon 6; IKX was generated
from a novel exon combination with and without the 30-base deletion.
Payne et al. (2001) detected multiple DNA-binding and nonbinding
isoforms with a 60-base insertion linked to leukemia expressed at the
RNA level in normal hemopoietic cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that the predominant isoform in normal cells is IKX, while the
predominant form in leukemic cells is IK1.

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in IKZF1, IKZF3 (606221),TCF3 (147141), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes
BCR-ABL1 (see 151410, 189980), is the defining lesion of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to
induce ALL, Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of
diagnostic leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43
BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the
transcription factor Ikaros, was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but
not in chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an
acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid
blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency,
expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss
of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested
that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for
the deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Mullighan et al. (2009) identified deletions involving the IKZF1 gene in
leukemic cells of 63 (28.6%) of 221 children with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Cells from 20 patients had a deletion of coding
exons 3 through 6, resulting in the expression of a dominant-negative
form of IKZF1. IKZF1 deletions were associated with an increased risk of
relapse and adverse effects in the original cohort and in an independent
cohort of 258 patients (p values ranging from less than 0.001 to 0.004).

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
IKZF1 gene and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, see ALL2 (613067).

CYTOGENETICS

The BCL6 gene (109565), isolated from the breakpoints of 3q27-associated
chromosomal translocations, is implicated in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBL). Hosokawa et al. (2000) described the molecular
characterization of novel t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations in 2 patients
with DLBL. Molecular genetic analysis of the breakpoint area involving
BCL6 revealed the presence of the Ikaros gene. As a molecular
consequence of the translocation, the 5-prime regulatory region of BCL6
was replaced by the putative 5-prime regulatory region of the Ikaros
gene, probably leading to deregulated expression of the BCL6 gene
throughout B-cell differentiation. RT-PCR and FISH analyses of a patient
sample established that the translocation resulted in fusion of the
Ikaros and BCL6 genes. The clinical features of the 2 patients with DLBL
and t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations were reported by Ichinohasama et al.
(1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice homozygous for a germline mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain
lack not only T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but also
their earliest defined progenitors (Georgopoulos et al., 1994). In
contrast, the erythroid and myeloid lineages are intact in these mutant
mice. Klug et al. (1998) showed that the DNA-binding isoforms of mouse
Ikaros are localized in the nucleus of the most primitive hematopoietic
stem cell subset. They found that Ikaros localizes to heterochromatin in
Abelson-transformed pre-B lymphocytes. Changes in the RNA splicing
pattern of Ikaros occurred at 2 stages of lymphoid differentiation.

O'Neill et al. (1999, 2000) described the structure of a chromatin
remodeling complex associated with Ikaros that is present only in adult
hematopoietic cells. This complex binds to Ikaros-like DNA-binding
sites, including a long polypyrimidine-rich sequence upstream of the
human delta-globin gene (142000), and was thus called PYR complex.
Deletion of this sequence in a human beta locus-containing cosmid
(carrying sequences from the human gamma-A gene, 142200, through the
adult beta-globin gene, 141900) in transgenic mice resulted in delayed
switching from gamma-globin to beta-globin. Lopez et al. (2002) showed
that homozygous Ikaros-null mice lacked the PYR complex, demonstrating a
requirement for Ikaros in the formation of the complex on DNA.
Heterozygous Ikaros-null mice had about half as much PYR complex,
indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and PYR complex. They also
showed that Ikaros-null mice had multiple hematopoietic cell defects,
including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to
lymphoid and stem cell defects. The null mice also had a delay in murine
embryonic-to-adult beta-globin switching and a delay in human
gamma-to-beta switching, consistent with the suggested role for PYR
complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicated that
several hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages were
either up- or downregulated in 14-day embryos from Ikaros-null mice
compared with wildtype mice. These results indicated that Ikaros and PYR
complex function together in vivo at many adult hematopoietic
cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites, affecting their expression
and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized dendritic cells that
produce high levels of type I interferon (see IFNA1; 147660) upon viral
infection. Allman et al. (2006) showed that mice expressing low levels
of Ikaros lacked peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not other
dendritic cell subsets. Loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was
associated with inability to produce type I interferon after challenge
with Tlr7 (300365) or Tlr9 (605474) ligands or murine cytomegalovirus.
Conventional dendritic cells were present in normal numbers and
exhibited normal responses to in vivo challenge with murine
cytomegalovirus or inactivated toxoplasma antigen.

605565	TITLE *605565 RESISTIN; RETN
;;RSTN;;
FOUND IN INFLAMMATORY ZONE 3; FIZZ3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching sequence databases for genes similar to mouse Fizz1,
Holcomb et al. (2000) identified cDNAs encoding human FIZZ2 (RETNLB;
605645), which the authors incorrectly called FIZZ1, and human and mouse
FIZZ3 (RETN). The deduced 108-amino acid FIZZ3 protein, 53% identical to
mouse Fizz3 and 47% identical to human FIZZ2, shares an N-terminal
signal peptide and a C-terminal stretch of 10 cysteine residues with
identical spacing with the other FIZZ family members. In situ
hybridization analysis detected diffuse expression of mouse Fizz3 in
white but not brown adipose tissue in a variety of organs.

GENE FUNCTION

Type II diabetes (125853), characterized by target-tissue resistance to
insulin (176730), is epidemic in industrialized societies and is
strongly associated with obesity. Steppan et al. (2001) studied the
mechanism by which increased adiposity causes insulin resistance. They
demonstrated that adipocytes secrete a unique signaling molecule, which
they called resistin (for resistance to insulin), that may be the
hormone potentially linking obesity to diabetes. Steppan et al. (2001)
identified resistin, which is identical to FIZZ3, by screening for genes
that are induced during adipocyte differentiation but downregulated in
mature adipocytes exposed to thiazolidinediones (TZD),
insulin-secreting, antidiabetic drugs that interact with the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG; 601487). Resistin gene
expression is induced during adipocyte differentiation, and the resistin
polypeptide is specifically expressed and secreted by adipocytes.
Resistin circulates in mouse serum, and its level is increased markedly
in both genetic and diet-induced obesity. Immunoneutralization improves
blood glucose and insulin action in this model of type II diabetes. By
contrast, administration of resistin impairs glucose tolerance and
insulin action in normal mice. In mouse, a single mRNA of roughly 750
residues is robustly expressed in white adipose tissue but not in
several other mouse tissues. Resistin expression is greater in white
adipose tissue than in brown adipose tissue, where resistin mRNA is
barely detectable. Resistin mRNA levels varied as a function of white
adipose depot and gender, with the highest level of expression in female
gonadal fat. Immunohistochemistry of epididymal white adipose tissue
showed that the resistin protein is abundant in adipocyte cytoplasm.
Steppan et al. (2001) found that a unique pattern of C-terminal
cysteines (X11-C-X8-C-X-C-X3-C-X10-C-X-C-X-C-X9-CC-X3-6-END) is
conserved in a family of resistin-like molecules, including at least 3
distinct mouse subtypes.

McTernan et al. (2002) found that resistin mRNA expression was similar
in both subcutaneous abdominal and omental fat depots. However, the
abdominal depots showed a 418% increase in resistin mRNA expression
compared with the thigh. The authors suggested that increased resistin
expression in abdominal fat could explain the increased risk of type II
diabetes associated with central obesity.

Degawa-Yamauchi et al. (2003) investigated the role of resistin in
obesity and insulin resistance by quantitating resistin protein by ELISA
in serum of 27 lean and 50 obese subjects. There was more serum resistin
protein in obese than lean subjects. The elevation of serum resistin in
obese humans was confirmed by Western blot as was expression of resistin
protein in human adipose tissue and isolated adipocytes. There was a
significant positive correlation between resistin and body mass index
(BMI). Multiple regression analysis with predictors BMI and resistin
explained 25% of the variance in the homeostasis model assessment of
insulin resistance score. BMI was a significant predictor of insulin
resistance (P = 0.0002), but resistin adjusted for BMI was not (P =
0.11). The authors concluded that their data demonstrate that resistin
protein is present in human adipose tissue and blood, and that there is
significantly more serum resistin in obese subjects, but it is not a
significant predictor of insulin resistance when adjusted for adiposity.

Verma et al. (2003) incubated endothelial cells with human recombinant
resistin and observed an increase in ET1 (EDN1; 131240) release and ET1
mRNA expression, with no change in nitric oxide production. Treatment
with resistin increased ET1 promoter activity via the activator
protein-1 (AP1; see 165160) site. Resistin upregulated adhesion
molecules and chemokines and downregulated tumor necrosis factor
receptor-associated factor-3 (TRAF3; 601896), an inhibitor of CD40
ligand (CD40LG; 300386) signaling. Verma et al. (2003) concluded that
these effects may represent the mechanistic link between resistin and
cardiovascular disease in the metabolic syndrome (see 605552).

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2002) determined that the resistin gene comprises 4 exons,
the first of which is untranslated, and spans approximately 1,750 bp.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Patel et al. (2004) determined the crystal structure of resistin and
RELM-beta (605645), which revealed an unusual multimeric structure. Each
protomer comprises a carboxy-terminal disulfide-rich beta-sandwich
'head' domain and an amino-terminal alpha-helical 'tail' segment. The
alpha-helical segments associate to form 3-stranded coiled-coils, and
surface-exposed interchain disulfide linkages mediate the formation of
tail-to-tail hexamers. Analysis of serum samples showed that resistin
circulates in 2 distinct assembly states, likely corresponding to
hexamers and trimers. Infusion of a resistin mutant, lacking the
intertrimer disulfide bonds, in pancreatic insulin clamp studies
revealed substantially more potent effects on hepatic insulin
sensitivity than those observed with wildtype resistin.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cao and Hegele (2001) identified 2 noncoding single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RSTN gene useful for the study of diabetes,
obesity, or disorders of adipocyte biology such as lipodystrophy.

Pizzuti et al. (2002) searched for polymorphisms in the resistin gene by
SSCP and direct sequencing. They identified an ATG triplet repeat in the
3-prime-untranslated region and considered it for association with
insulin resistance. They identified 3 alleles: allele 1, with 8 repeats
and an allele frequency of 0.3%; allele 2, with 7 repeats and an allele
frequency of 94.5%; and allele 3, with 6 repeats and an allele frequency
of 5.2%. Allele 1 was not tested for association with insulin resistance
because of its very low allele frequency. Among Sicilians, subjects
carrying allele 3 had lower fasting insulin and insulin resistance
index, and lower glucose and insulin levels during the oral glucose
tolerance test. In subjects from Gargano (a region geographically close
to Sicily but with a different ethnicity), those carrying allele 3 had
lower fasting plasma glucose levels and serum triglycerides. When the 2
populations were analyzed together, subjects carrying allele 3 had lower
fasting insulin levels (P less than 0.005), homeostasis model assessment
of insulin resistance (P less than 0.005), and serum triglycerides (P =
0.01). The authors concluded that subjects carrying the 6-repeat allele
of the resistin gene are characterized by relatively high insulin
sensitivity.

Wang et al. (2002) hypothesized that genetic variation in the RSTN gene
might explain the heritability of insulin action in familial type II
diabetes kindreds. They screened 44 subjects with type II diabetes and
20 nondiabetic family members who were at the extremes of insulin
sensitivity. They identified 8 noncoding SNPs and 1 GAT microsatellite
repeat. Three SNPs, which were in incomplete linkage disequilibrium with
each other and had allelic frequencies exceeding 5%, were selected for
further study. No SNP was associated with type II diabetes, but the SNP
in the promoter region was a significant determinant of insulin
sensitivity index (P = 0.04) among nondiabetic family members who had
undergone intravenous glucose tolerance tests. The authors concluded
that the 3 common SNPs showed statistical significance as determinants
of insulin sensitivity index (P less than 0.01) in interaction with body
mass index.

Ma et al. (2002) sequenced the resistin gene in 32 subjects with type II
diabetes and identified 8 SNPs in the 5-prime flanking region and
introns of the gene. Allele and genotype distributions were determined
for all 8 SNPs in 312 cases with type II diabetes and in 303 nondiabetic
controls, all of Caucasian origin. No significant association with type
II diabetes was found at any of the polymorphic loci; however, an
interactive effect of one SNP, IVS2+181G-A, with obesity was a
significant determinant of type II diabetes risk in this population.

Insulin resistance is a major cause of type II diabetes mellitus.
Resistin, an adipocyte-secreted hormone, antagonizes insulin. Transgenic
mice that overexpress Retn in adipose tissue are insulin resistant
(Pravenec et al., 2003), whereas Retn-null mice show lower fasting blood
glucose (Banerjee et al., 2004), suggesting that the altered Retn
promoter function could cause diabetes. To determine the possible role
of RETN in human type II diabetes, Osawa et al. (2004) analyzed
polymorphisms in its 5-prime flanking region. They found that the GG
genotype at the -420C-G SNP was associated with type II diabetes with an
adjusted odds ratio of 1.97 and could accelerate the onset of diabetes
by 4.9 years. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that the GG
genotype itself was a primary variant in determining type II diabetes
susceptibility. Functionally, transcription factors Sp1 (189906) and Sp3
(601804) bound specifically to the susceptible DNA element that included
-420G. Overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 enhanced RETN promoter activity.
Consistent with these findings, fasting serum resistin levels were
higher in type II diabetes patients with the GG genotype. Osawa et al.
(2004) concluded that the specific recognition of -420G by Sp1/3
increases RETN promoter activity, leading to enhanced serum resistin
levels, thereby inducing human type II diabetes.

Mattevi et al. (2004) studied the association of the -420C-G SNP of the
RETN gene with obesity-related phenotypes in 585 nondiabetic Brazilians
of European descent. In the 356 women in the study, the G allele was
somewhat less frequent in the overweight/obese group than in normal
weight individuals (p = 0.040). Female carriers of the G allele had a
lower mean BMI and waist circumference than C/C homozygotes (p = 0.010).
When women were stratified by menopausal status, the association was
restricted to premenopausal women. Mattevi et al. (2004) suggested that
RETN gene variation has gender-specific effects on BMI.

MAPPING

Steppan et al. (2001) localized the human resistin gene to a cloned
fragment of human chromosome 19 (GenBank GENBANK AC008763).

ANIMAL MODEL

Rajala et al. (2003) found that an infusion of either resistin or RETNLB
in rats rapidly induced severe hepatic but not peripheral insulin
resistance. Increases in circulating resistin or RETNLB levels markedly
stimulated hepatic glucose production despite the presence of fixed
physiologic insulin levels. This enhanced rate of glucose output was due
to increased flux through glucose-6-phosphatase. The results supported
the notion that a novel family of fat- and gut-derived circulating
proteins modulates hepatic insulin action.

Banerjee et al. (2004) generated mice deficient in resistin by targeted
disruption. Resistin-null mice exhibited low blood glucose levels after
fasting due to reduced hepatic glucose production. This was partly
mediated by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (see 602739) and
decreased expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in the liver. Banerjee et
al. (2004) suggested that their data supported a physiologic function
for resistin in the maintenance of blood glucose during fasting.
Remarkably, lack of resistin diminished the increase in post-fast blood
glucose normally associated with increased weight, suggesting a role for
resistin in mediating hyperglycemia associated with obesity.

To determine whether resistin plays a causative role in the development
of diet-induced insulin resistance, Muse et al. (2004) lowered
circulating resistin levels in mice by use of a specific antisense
oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO) directed against resistin mRNA and assessed
in vivo insulin action by the insulin clamp technique. After 3 weeks on
a high-fat diet, mice displayed severe insulin resistance associated
with an approximately 80% increase in plasma resistin levels. In
particular, the rate of endogenous glucose production increased more
than 2-fold compared with that in mice fed a standard chow. Treatment
with the resistin ASO for 1 week normalized the plasma resistin levels
and completely reversed the hepatic insulin resistance. Acute infusion
of purified recombinant mouse resistin in these mice, designed to
elevate acutely the levels of circulating resistin up to those observed
in the mice fed a high-fat diet, was sufficient to reconstitute hepatic
insulin resistance. These results provided strong support for the
physiologic role of resistin in the development of hepatic insulin
resistance.

RETN, +62G-A

Cao and Hegele (2001) identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
of the RETN gene, +62G-A, located 62 bp downstream of the last base of
the codon for termination in the 3-prime untranslated region of exon 4.

Tan et al. (2003) studied the association of the resistin gene +62G-A
polymorphism with type II diabetes (125853) in 1,102 Chinese type II
diabetes patients and 743 subjects without diabetes. Type II diabetes
subjects had a lower frequency of the A allele (GG:GA/AA, 83.5%:16.5%)
than did the controls (GG:GA/AA, 75.1%:24.9%; odds ratio, 1.524; 95% CI,
1.268-1.831; P less than 0.001). Unexpectedly, diabetic patients with
the GG genotype had a higher prevalence of hypertension (GG:GA/AA,
49.8%:36.2%; odds ratio, 1.375; 95% CI, 1.116-1.693; P = 0.001).
Logistic regression analysis confirmed that the +62G-A polymorphism acts
as an independent contributing factor to type II diabetes and
hypertension. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in
diabetic subjects with the GG genotype (144 +/- 21/87 +/- 13 mm Hg) were
significantly higher than those in subjects with GA/AA variants (139 +/-
21/84 +/- 14 mm Hg; P = 0.004 and P = 0.002, respectively). The authors
concluded that resistin may play a role in the pathogenesis of type II
diabetes and insulin resistance-related hypertension.

;;miRNA200C;;
MIRN200C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN200C, are 20- to 22-nucleotide noncoding
RNAs that inhibit gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by
binding to complementary sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs
(Park et al., 2008).

CLONING

Park et al. (2008) stated that miR200C belongs to the miR200 family of
miRNAs, which can be divided into 2 subfamilies based on a 1-nucleotide
difference in seed sequences. miR200A (612090) and miR141 (612093) have
a seed sequence of AACACUG, whereas miR200B (612091), miR200C, and
miR429 (612094) have a seed sequence of AAUACUG.

GENE FUNCTION

Park et al. (2008) evaluated expression of 207 miRNAs in 60 human cell
lines and found that expression of miR200 family members, including
miR200C, was associated with an epithelial phenotype. Expression of
these miRNAs showed a positive correlation with expression of E-cadherin
(CDH1; 192090), an epithelial cell marker, and a negative correlation
with expression of vimentin (VIM; 193060), a mesenchymal cell marker.
Park et al. (2008) identified multiple miR200 target sequences in the
3-prime UTRs of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 (189909)
and ZEB2 (605802). Using the 3-prime UTRs of mouse and human ZEB1 and
ZEB2, they showed that endogenous miR200s suppressed ZEB1 and ZEB2
expression. Increasing the levels of miR200A and miR200C induced
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in human cancer cell lines,
reducing their aggressiveness. Conversely, reducing miR200 levels
induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Park et al. (2008)
concluded that the miR200 family regulates EMT/MET by targeting ZEB1 and
ZEB2, which control expression of E-cadherin.

Using the MDCK canine epithelial cell line and a subclone with a
mesenchymal phenotype, Gregory et al. (2008) independently showed that
the miR200 family, including miR141, and miR205 (613147) regulated
expression of Zeb1 and Zeb2 and controlled EMT. Furthermore, expression
of the miR200 family and miR205 was lost in invasive human breast cancer
cell lines with mesenchymal phenotype and in primary breast cancer
specimens lacking E-cadherin.

Shimono et al. (2009) showed that MIR200C downregulated expression of
BMI1 (164831), a regulator of stem cell self-renewal. Expression of
MIR200C resulted in growth retardation and differentiation in Tera-2
cells, suppressed clonogenicity in mouse breast cancer cells, reduced
tumorigenicity of human breast cancer stem cells in immunocompromised
mice, and suppressed mammary outgrowth from normal mouse mammary stem
cells in vivo. Shimono et al. (2009) concluded that MIR200C provides a
molecular link between normal and cancerous stem cells.

MAPPING

Park et al. (2008) stated that the miR200 family members MIRN200C and
MIRN141 are clustered on chromosome 12, whereas MIRN200A, MIRN200B, and
MIRN429 are clustered on chromosome 1.

613117	TITLE *613117 SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNA, C/D BOX, 50A; SNORD50A
;;RNA, U50 SMALL NUCLEOLAR; RNU50;;
snoRNA, U50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNORD50A belongs to the C/D box class of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs),
which are thought to function as guide RNAs in the site-specific ribose
methylation of preribosomal RNA (Kiss-Laszlo et al., 1996).

CLONING

Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) isolated SNORD50A, which they called RNU50,
from a cDNA library of intronic snoRNAs from HeLa cells. RNU50 is 74
nucleotides long.

GENE FUNCTION

Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) found that a 15-nucleotide sequence of RNU50
was complementary to a region near the D box of 28S ribosomal RNA (see
180450), and that a 12-nucleotide sequence of RNU50 was complementary to
a region near the D-prime box of 28S RNA. These regions of 28S RNA
contain an O-methylcytosine and a potential O-methylguanine,
respectively. Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) hypothesized that RNU50 may have
a role in methylation of 28S RNA at these sites.

Using Northern blot analysis and real-time PCR, Dong et al. (2008)
showed that expression of snoRNA U50 was downregulated in a significant
number of primary prostate cancer specimens and prostate cancer cell
lines. Ectopic expression of snoRNA U50 significantly reduced colony
formation in the 2 prostate cancer cell lines examined.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tanaka et al. (2000) determined that the
SNORD50A gene lies within intron 5 of the SNHG5 gene (613263) on
chromosome 6q15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dong et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2-bp (TT) germline deletion
in the SNORD50A gene in 2 (2%) of 89 unrelated patients with prostate
cancer but not in 104 men without prostate cancer. A somatic homozygous
TT deletion was found 2 of 30 prostate cancer cell lines or xenografts,
and 9 of 89 localized prostate cancers (total, 11 (9%) of 119 cancers).
The homozygous deletion abolished U50 suppressive function in a colony
formation assay, suggesting that SNORD50A is a tumor suppressor gene and
that germline mutation may increase susceptibility to prostate cancer.
Further analysis of 1,371 prostate cancer patients and 1,371 matched
controls showed that a heterozygous germline TT deletion was found at
similar levels in patients and controls, suggesting that it may be a
common polymorphism.

;;WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 10; WDR10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A conserved core of 4 or more modular repeat units defines a group of
functionally diverse regulatory proteins in eukaryotes known as the WD
repeat family. WD repeats are minimally conserved regions of
approximately 40 amino acids typically bracketed by gly-his and trp-asp
(GH-WD), which may facilitate formation of heterotrimeric or
multiprotein complexes. Proteins belonging to the WD repeat family are
involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle
progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation
(summary by Claudio et al., 1999).

CLONING

Gross et al. (2001) screened human HL60 leukemia and prostate and colon
cancer cDNA libraries with degenerate oligonucleotide primers directed
to sequences encoding the AF2 domains of class III nuclear receptors.
They then used 5-prime and 3-prime RACE and screening of a testis cDNA
library to clone IFT122, which they designated WDR10. They also isolated
a longer variant of this cDNA, which appeared to have an additional
153-bp exon near the 5-prime end. The full-length WDR10 cDNA encodes a
deduced 1,242-amino acid protein with an AF2-like domain, 7 N-terminal
WD repeat units, and 2 potential nuclear localization sequences.
Northern blot analysis detected a single 4-kb WDR10 transcript in most
tissues tested, with predominant expression in testis and pituitary; a
3.5-kb transcript was detected in HL60 leukemia cells. Study of a
WDR10-GFP fusion protein demonstrated that WDR10 is localized in the
cytoplasm. In situ hybridization on reproductive tissues in the rat
showed stage-specific expression of WDR10 within developing sperm and
ovarian follicles.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gross et al. (2001) determined that the IFT122 gene has at least 28
exons spanning approximately 65 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By FISH, Gross et al. (2001) mapped the IFT122 gene to chromosome 3q21.

GENE FUNCTION

Walczak-Sztulpa et al. (2010) performed morpholino knockdown of ift122
in zebrafish embryos and observed defects typical of other ciliopathy
models including shortened body axis and curvature, cardiac edema, and
small eyes at 80 hours postfertilization, with pronephric cysts and a
distended cranium consistent with hydrocephalus and otolith defects at 5
days postfertilization. Cilia and their basal bodies were dramatically
reduced in the pronephric duct of morphant embryos compared to control
embryos, and primary cilia shortening was observed in the morphant
zebrafish Kupffer vesicle.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a consanguineous Polish family with cranioectodermal dysplasia
mapping to chromosome 3q21-q24 (CED1; 218330), Walczak-Sztulpa et al.
(2010) sequenced 79 candidate genes and identified homozygosity for a
missense mutation in the IFT122 gene (V553G; 606045.0001) that
segregated with the disease. Fibroblasts from 1 of the sibs showed
significantly reduced cilia frequency and length compared to controls.
Analysis of IFT122 in 11 additional unrelated patients with CED revealed
homozygosity and compound heterozygosity for mutations in 2 of the
patients (606045.0002-606045.0004, respectively).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CRANIOECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA 1
IFT122, VAL553GLY

In an affected sister and brother with cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED1;
218330), born of distantly related Polish parents, Walczak-Sztulpa et
al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a T-G transversion in the IFT122
gene, resulting in a val553-to-gly (V553G) substitution at a highly
conserved residue. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 340 ethnically matched control
chromosomes. Analysis of fibroblasts from the brother showed
significantly reduced cilia frequency and length compared to 3
unrelated, healthy German controls.

In a boy with cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED1; 218330), born of
fourth-cousin Norwegian parents and previously reported by Fry et al.
(2009), Walczak-Sztulpa et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a C-T
transition in the IFT122 gene, resulting in a ser373-to-phe (S373F)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. The unaffected parents were
heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 340 ethnically
matched control chromosomes. The patient had an unaffected sister.

In an Italian boy with cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED1; 218330),
originally reported by Zaffanello et al. (2006), Walczak-Sztulpa et al.
(2010) identified compound heterozygosity for a G-A transition in intron
6 (502+5G-A) of the IFT122 gene and a de novo trp7-to-cys substitution
(W7C; 606045.0004) at a highly conserved residue in exon 1. The mother
was a heterozygous carrier of the splice site mutation but the missense
mutation was not detected in either parent; neither mutation was found
in 340 ethnically matched control chromosomes.

186820	TITLE *186820 T-CELL ANTIGEN CD7; CD7
;;Tp41
DESCRIPTION The CD7 antigen is a cell surface glycoprotein found on thymocytes and
mature T cells. It is one of the earliest antigens to appear on cells of
the T-lymphocyte lineage and the most reliable clinical marker of T-cell
acute lymphocytic leukemia. Aruffo and Seed (1987) isolated and
sequenced a full-length CD7 cDNA as well as a cDNA for an unusual
intron-bearing precursor. They found that COS cells expressing CD7 do
not bind IgM. Van Dongen et al. (1985) assigned T-cell antigen Tp41
(CD7) to chromosome 17 by somatic cell hybridization. Osada et al.
(1988) confirmed the location of CD7 on chromosome 17 by studying
reactivity with Tp40 antibody in hybrid human-mouse T-cell clones. By
chromosomal in situ hybridization, Baker et al. (1990) localized CD7 to
17q25.2-q25.3. Schanberg et al. (1991) isolated and characterized the
human CD7 gene and its 5-prime flanking region; the gene comprises 4
exons that span 3.5 kb. Comparison of the organization of the CD7 gene
with that of other members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily
revealed that the human CD7 gene most closely resembles the murine Thy-1
gene (188230). Both genes have 4 exons and promoters with no TATA boxes.
Yoshikawa et al. (1991) cloned and characterized the CD7 gene.

Jung et al. (1986) found that the T-cell surface membrane-associated
glycoprotein CD7, which they referred to as Tp40 (40,000 MW), was not
expressed by the T cells of a patient with severe combined
immunodeficiency. In addition to this abnormality, T-cell proliferative
responses to mitogens were defective and the IL2 receptor expression was
deficient on the patient's T lymphocytes. However, his T cells were
found to provide help for the differentiation of normal B cells to
Ig-secreting cells. Abundant circulating B cells were detected. The
findings were interpreted as supporting the idea that the Tp40
deficiency was related to a defect in T-cell precursors, and that Tp40
plays an essential role not only in T-cell interactions but also in
certain aspects of T-cell/B-cell interaction during early lymphoid
development. However, Bonilla et al. (1997) found that targeted
disruption of the mouse CD7 gene (located on chromosome 11 in that
species), with resulting CD7 deficiency, was associated with normal
histology of thymus and spleen, normal lymphocyte populations in primary
and secondary lymphoid tissues, and normal serum Ig levels. Specific
antibody responses after immunization with T-dependent and T-independent
antigens were equivalent in wildtype and CD7 knockout mice.
CD7-deficient lymphocytes responded normally to T-cell mitogenic and
allogeneic stimuli, and displayed normal NK cell cytotoxicity.

614471	TITLE *614471 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 19; USP19
;;KIAA0891
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

USP19 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (EC 3.4.19.12) with a role in
regulating cell cycle progression (Lu et al., 2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned USP19, which they designated
KIAA0891. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the ubiquitin protease UNPH (USP4; 603486). RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression in fetal liver, followed by adult spinal
cord. All other tissues, including adult and fetal brain, showed much
lower expression, and no expression was detected in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that
regulates the G1/S transition. Using rat myoblast and fibroblast cell
lines, Lu et al. (2009) showed that Usp19 regulated p27(KIP1) levels by
deubiquitinating and stabilizing Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that ubiquitinates cytosolic p27(KIP1) and targets it for
proteasomal degradation at G1 phase. Immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that Usp19 interacted directly with Kpc1. Knockdown of Usp19
resulted in loss of Kpc1, accumulation of p27(KIP1), inhibition of cell
proliferation, and slower progression from G0/G1 to S phase.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the USP19 gene
to chromosome 3.

Hartz (2011) mapped the USP19 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the USP19 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020698) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GTF2IRD1 gene was identified within the chromosomal region on
7q11.23 commonly deleted in Williams syndrome (194050) and is involved
in mammalian craniofacial and cognitive development (Tassabehji et al.,
2005).

CLONING

Tassabehji et al. (1999) isolated and characterized a 3.4-kb gene, which
they called general transcription factor III (GTF3), which occupies
about 140 kb of the region deleted in Williams syndrome. Northern blot
analysis showed that the gene is expressed in skeletal muscle and heart,
and RT-PCR analysis showed expression in a range of adult tissues with
stronger expression in fetal tissues. Part of the conceptual GTF3
protein sequence was found to be almost identical to a slow muscle-fiber
enhancer binding protein identified by O'Mahoney et al. (1998) and
termed MusTRD1. GTF3 showed significant homology to the 90-amino acid
putative helix-loop-helix repeat (HLH) domains of the transcription
factor TFII-I (GTF2I; 601679), which maps distal to GTF4 within the
Williams syndrome deleted region.

Osborne et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they termed
WBSCR11, by genomic DNA sequence analysis and screening of 2 colon
carcinoma cell line cDNA libraries. The cDNA sequence predicts an
895-amino acid protein.

Franke et al. (1999) cloned GTF2IRD1 from cDNA libraries representing
several diverse tissues, and they obtained a full-length cDNA by 5-prime
RACE of an adult brain cDNA library. They also identified several splice
variants arising from exon skipping. The longest deduced protein
contains 944 amino acids. In addition to the repeated GTF2I motifs and
HLH repeats, Franke et al. (1999) identified a myc (190080)-type HLH
dimerization domain, a number of putative phosphorylation sites and
N-myristoylation sites, an amidation site, and several putative nuclear
localization signals. Northern blot analysis detected expression of
GTF2IRD1 in all adult and fetal tissues except leukocytes. The dominant
transcript was 3.6 kb long, with sizes ranging from 1.5 kb to 5.0 kb.

By Western blot analysis, Yan et al. (2000) found that endogenous
GTF2IRD1, which they designated CREAM1, was expressed at low levels as a
120-kD protein in a variety of human cell lines and tissues. GTF2IRD1
was expressed in the nucleus of transfected cells, and deletion of the
C-terminal nuclear localization signal resulted in cytoplasmic
expression.

Bayarsaihan and Ruddle (2000) cloned mouse Gtf2ird1, which they
designated Ben. The deduced full-length 1,072-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal leucine zipper motif, followed by 6
helix-loop-helix domains, a nuclear localization signal, and a
C-terminal serine-rich region. Northern blot analysis detected several
Ben transcripts in all mouse tissues examined. Western blot analysis
showed several Ben isoforms with apparent molecular masses of 40 to 165
kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Osborne et al. (1999) determined that the WBSCR11 gene spans 95 kb of
genomic DNA and consists of 26 exons, not including the last noncoding
exon.

Franke et al. (1999) determined that the GTF2IRD1 gene contains up to 30
exons and spans about 105 kb. The coding sequence uses 26 exons.

Palmer et al. (2010) determined that the region upstream of the GTF2IRD1
gene contains a well-conserved CCAAT box and 3 canonical
GTF2IRD1-recognition sequences (GGATTA), one of which is inverted.

MAPPING

Franke et al. (1999) reported that the GF2IRD1 gene maps within the WBS
deletion region on chromosome 7q11.23 and is oriented 5-prime to 3-prime
in the centromeric to telomeric orientation.

Tassabehji et al. (1999) tabulated 11 genes in addition to GTF3 that had
been mapped to the deleted area of chromosome 7 in classic Williams
syndrome.

Lazebnik et al. (2008) stated that the mouse Gtf2ird1 gene maps to a
region of chromosome 5 that shares homology of synteny with human
chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Yan et al. (2000) determined that GTF2IRD1 interacted with the RB1
protein (614041) in vitro and in vivo. They also showed that full length
GTF2IRD1 stimulated transcription of a reporter gene and, by mutation
analysis, they localized the activation domain to the N terminus.

Using yeast 1-hybrid analysis, Bayarsaihan and Ruddle (2000) showed that
in vitro-translated mouse Ben interacted with an early enhancer upstream
of the Hoxc8 (142970) transcription start site.

Ring et al. (2002) characterized the Xenopus homolog of GTF2IRD1,
Xwbscr11. They determined that Xwbscr11 binds DNA via selective HLH
repeats and interacts with the transcription factor FOXH1 (603621) and
the signal transduction molecules Smad2 (601366) and Smad3 (603109) to
affect activin (147290)/nodal-mediated induction of the distal element
of the Xenopus goosecoid promoter.

Vullhorst and Buonanno (2003) characterized mouse Gtf3 splice variants.
They determined that HLH domain 4 is necessary and sufficient for
binding the bicoid-like motif of the troponin (191042) enhancer. An
isoform that lacks exon 23 and exons 26 through 28 interacted most
avidly with the bicoid-like motif. Isoforms that included these exons
failed to bind in gel retardation assays. The authors also determined
that Gtf3 polypeptides associate with each other via the leucine zipper.

Lazebnik et al. (2008) showed that BEN bound the 8-bp core consensus
sequence CAG(C/G)G(C/A)GA, surrounded by G- and C-rich sequences. BEN
repressed expression of a reporter gene containing 3 copies of the
sequence 5-prime-GGGGGCAGCGACAGCCCCC-3-prime. Knockdown of Ben
expression in C2C12 mouse myoblasts enhanced expression of Bmpr1b
(603248), Sox4 (184430), En1 (131290), and Fgf15, the mouse ortholog of
FGF19 (603891). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis followed by
quantitative PCR confirmed binding of BEN to Fgf15.

Palmer et al. (2010) found that GTF2IRD1 is subject to negative
autoregulation. All isoforms of mouse or human GTF2IRD1 bound 3
canonical GTF2IRD1-binding sites (GGATTA) in the region upstream of the
GTF2IRD1 gene. EMSA using artificial DNA probes and in vitro-translated
GTF2IRD1 revealed enhanced binding in the presence of 3 GGATTA sites and
dimerization of GTF2IRD1 proteins via an N-terminal leucine zipper
region. Binding by GTF2IRD1 repressed expression of a reporter gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tassabehji et al. (1999) found that GTF3 was deleted in patients with
classic Williams syndrome, but not in patients with partial deletions
who had only supravalvular aortic stenosis. They suggested that
haploinsufficiency of the GTF3 gene may be the cause of the abnormal
muscle fatigability that is characteristic of Williams syndrome.

Tassabehji et al. (2005) reported a rare WBS individual with an atypical
deletion, including the GTF2IRD1 gene, showed facial dysmorphism and
cognitive deficits that differed from those of classic WBS cases. They
proposed a mechanism of cumulative dosage effects of duplicated and
diverged genes applicable to other human chromosomal disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tassabehji et al. (2005) demonstrated that GTF2IRD1 is involved in
mammalian craniofacial and cognitive development. Gtf2ird1-null mice
exhibited phenotypic abnormalities reminiscent of the human
microdeletion disorder Williams-Beuren syndrome; craniofacial imaging
revealed abnormalities in both skull and jaws that may arise through
misregulation of goosecoid (138890), a downstream target of Gtf2ird1.

Palmer et al. (2010) found that mutant mice lacking Gtf2ird1 exon 2
expressed a mutant Gtf2ird1 transcript. The mutant transcript was
expressed at wildtype levels due to escape from nonsense mediated decay
and escape from negative autoregulation by Gtf2ird1 itself.

607082	TITLE *607082 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, ALPHA-2/DELTA SUBUNIT 2; CACNA2D2
;;KIAA0558
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CACNA2D2 gene encodes the alpha-2-delta-2 auxiliary subunit of high
voltage-gated calcium channels. Auxiliary subunits modulate calcium
current and channel activation and inactivation kinetics, and may be
involved in proper assembly and membrane localization of the channels.
Alpha-2-delta-2 is a receptor for the antiepileptic drug gabapentin
(summary by Edvardson et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching for sequences with the potential to encode large proteins
expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding
CACNA2D2, which they called KIAA0558. The deduced 1,145-amino acid
protein was predicted to be 45% identical to mouse Cacna2d2. RT-PCR
analysis detected ubiquitous expression.

Using a positional cloning strategy to identify a putative tumor
suppressor gene on chromosome 3p21.3, Gao et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA
encoding CACNA2D2. The CACNA2D2 protein is 56% identical to CACNA2D1
(114204), and 17 of 22 cysteines in CACNA2D2 are conserved in CACNA2S1,
suggesting similar secondary structures. CACNA2D2 also has multiple
putative N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a 5.5-kb transcript that was most abundant in lung and
testis, followed by brain, heart, and pancreas, with low levels in
prostate and skeletal muscle. Some lung cancer lines expressed CACNA2D2.
Western blot analysis showed expression of a 150-kD protein, larger than
the predicted 130 kD, presumably due to glycosylation. Functional
analysis indicated that CACNA2D2 is able to act as an auxiliary subunit
of all 3 subfamilies of voltage-gated calcium channels.

By physical cloning methodologies and bioinformatic computational
analyses, Lerman and Minna (2000) identified a number of genes,
including CACNA2D2, in a region of chromosome 3p21.3 that is associated
with a putative lung cancer tumor suppressor gene. They did not detect
CACNA2D2 mutations in any lung cancer cell lines tested.

Each alpha-2-delta subunit is encoded by a single gene and
post-translationally cleaved into a long, N-terminal, extracellular
alpha-2 protein and a shorter, membrane-anchored delta polypeptide; the
alpha-2 and delta proteins are covalently linked by disulfide bonds
(summary by Brill et al., 2004).

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) determined that
the CACNA2D2 gene contains at least 40 exons and spans approximately 140
kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the CACNA2D2
gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Gao et al. (2000)
refined the localization to 3p21.3, a site of frequent deletions in
breast and lung cancers.

GENE FUNCTION

Hoppa et al. (2012) showed that a trafficking step probably sets
synaptic voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) levels in rats, because
overexpression of the pore-forming alpha-1A VGCC subunit (CACNA1A;
601011) fails to change synaptic VGCC abundance or function.
Alpha-2-deltas are a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored VGCC-associated subunits that, in addition to being the
target of the potent neuropathic analgesics gabapentin and pregabalin
(alpha-2-delta-1 (CACNA2D1) and alpha-2-delta-2 (CACNA2D2)), were also
identified in a forward genetic screen for pain genes (alpha-2-delta-3
(CACNA2D3; 606399)). Hoppa et al. (2012) showed that these proteins
confer powerful modulation of presynaptic function through 2 distinct
molecular mechanisms. First, alpha-2-delta subunits set synaptic VGCC
abundance, as predicted from their chaperone-like function when
expressed in nonneuronal cells. Second, alpha-2-deltas configure
synaptic VGCCs to drive exocytosis through an extracellular metal
ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), a conserved set of amino acids
within the predicted von Willebrand A domain of alpha-2-delta.
Expression of alpha-2-delta with an intact MIDAS motif leads to an 80%
increase in release probability, while simultaneously protecting
exocytosis from blockade by an intracellular calcium chelator.
Alpha-2-deltas harboring MIDAS site mutations still drive synaptic
accumulation of VGCCs; however, they no longer change release
probability or sensitivity to intracellular calcium chelators. Hoppa et
al. (2012) concluded that their data reveal dual functionality of these
clinically important VGCC subunits, allowing synapses to make more
efficient use of calcium entry to drive neurotransmitter release.

ANIMAL MODEL

Brodbeck et al. (2002) showed that mice with the 'ducky' (du) mutation,
a model for absence epilepsy (see 600131), had a mutation in Cacna2d2
gene. The mutation resulted in the introduction of a premature stop
codon and the expression of a truncated protein encoded by the first 3
exons of Cacna2d2, followed by 8 novel amino acids. The shortened mRNA
and protein were expressed in mutant mouse cerebellum and Purkinje
cells. Brodbeck et al. (2002) detected high expression of the normal
protein in cerebellar Purkinje cells, but found that ducky mice had
abnormalities in their Purkinje cell dendritic trees. Functional
analysis indicated that the mutant Cacna2d2 protein failed to increase
or even decreased the peak current density of the voltage-gated Ca(V)2.1
(CACNA1A; 601011)/beta-4 (CACNB4; 601949) channel combination,
suggesting that it may contribute to the ducky phenotype.

Brill et al. (2004) identified a recessive mouse phenotype, 'entla,'
caused by an in-frame duplication of 39 amino acids in the Cacna2d2
gene, resulting in expression of a full-length, membrane-associated
protein, but with loss of the disulfide linkage between the 2 derived
proteins. Mutant mice developed ataxia by postnatal day 13 to 15
followed by paroxysmal dyskinesia. The mice showed reduced size and
weight, increased mortality before weaning, and female infertility. EEG
studies suggested absence epilepsy, with 2- and 4-Hz spike-wave
discharges in the cortex and hippocampus. Cerebellar Purkinje cells
isolated from mutant mice showed about a 50% reduction in current, as
well as a reduction of gabapentin binding to the membrane compared to
wildtype and to heterozygous mice. Entla (ent) mice showed no
neuroanatomical abnormalities.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CACNA2D2, LEU1040PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy has not
been confirmed.

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Arab-Palestinian parents, with early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy, global developmental delay, and
cerebellar atrophy, Edvardson et al. (2013) identified a homozygous
3119A-G transition in the CACNA2D2 gene, resulting in a leu1040-to-pro
(L1040P) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The variant, which
was identified by linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing,
was not found in 102 controls or in 6,503 control exomes. In vitro
expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed that the variant protein
decreased currents of N- and L-type calcium channels and caused slower
inactivation in N-type channels. Although the variant protein was
expressed, it showed decreased localization to the plasma membrane
compared to wildtype, suggesting that it may not properly associate with
the alpha-1 subunit. Edvardson et al. (2013) postulated that prolonged
channel opening and calcium influx during depolarization associated with
delayed inactivation may underlie the epileptic phenotype observed in
these patients. There was no evidence for a dominant-negative effect.
Exome sequencing in 1 of the 3 affected sibs also identified a
homozygous C-to-T transition in the CELSR3 gene (604264), resulting in a
met2630-to-ile (M2630I; 604264.0001) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. This variant also segregated with the disease state in the
family. Inactivation of Celsr3 in mice causes abnormalities in
connectivity in the cerebral cortex (Zhou et al., 2008). Edvardson et
al. (2013) could not exclude a role for the CELSR3 mutation in the
epileptic phenotype in this family.

610611	TITLE *610611 GINS COMPLEX SUBUNIT 4; GINS4
;;SLD5, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SLD5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The yeast heterotetrameric GINS complex is made up of Sld5, Psf1 (GINS1;
610608), Psf2 (GINS2; 610609), and Psf3 (GINS3; 610610). The formation
of the GINS complex is essential for the initiation of DNA replication
in yeast and Xenopus egg extracts (Ueno et al., 2005). See GINS1 for
additional information about the GINS complex.

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to yeast SLD5,
Takayama et al. (2003) identified GINS4, which they called SLD5. The
deduced protein contains 223 amino acids.

Using mouse Psf1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid analysis of an 11-day mouse
embryo cDNA library, Kong et al. (2006) cloned Sld5. The deduced
223-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a
central basic region, and a C-terminal domain that is conserved between
the mouse and yeast proteins. RT-PCR of mouse tissues detected abundant
expression in adult testis, and weak expression in thymus and bone
marrow. No Sld5 was detected in brain, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and
heart. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Psf1 and Sld5 in the
cytoplasm of transfected NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Kong et al. (2006) demonstrated that
mouse Sld5 and Psf1 interacted in transfected NIH3T3 cells.

MAPPING

International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GINS4 gene
to chromosome 8 (TMAP RH102031).

NOMENCLATURE

The GINS complex derives its name from the Japanese words Go, Ichi, Nii,
and San, which mean 5, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and refer to the
numbering of the yeast homologs of the GINS complex (Takayama et al.,
2003).
