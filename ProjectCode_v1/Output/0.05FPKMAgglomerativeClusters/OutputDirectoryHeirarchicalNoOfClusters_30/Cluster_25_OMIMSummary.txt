;;PP32R2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kadkol et al. (1999) identified and cloned ANP32C (606877) and ANP32D,
which they called PP32R1 and PP32R2, respectively, by RT-PCR of
prostatic adenocarcinoma amplified with primers for PP32 (600832).
ANP32D, ANP32C, and PP32 share approximately 90% amino acid sequence
identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Kadkol et al. (1999) determined that, whereas PP32 is a tumor
suppressor, both ANP32C and ANP32D are tumorigenic. ANP32C and ANP32D
were able to stimulate transformed focus formation when cotransfected
into NIH 3T3 cells along with tumor promoters. NIH 3T3 cells transformed
with ANP32C or ANP32D were also tumorigenic in nude mice. Kadkol et al.
(1999) suggested that alternative use of ANP32D, ANP32C, and PP32 may
modulate the oncogenic potential of human prostate cancer.

Brody et al. (1999) determined that the region of PP32 spanning amino
acids 150 to 174 is responsible for its tumor suppressor activity and
that this region is truncated in ANP32D.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kadkol et al. (1999) stated that the ANP32D gene is intronless.

MAPPING

Kadkol et al. (1999) stated that the ANP32D gene maps to chromosome 12.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ferrous transport (Fet) proteins are involved in the uptake and
processing of iron in yeast. By analysis of Fet mutants, Radisky et al.
(1997) identified yeast Vps41 as a gene required for assembly and
targeting of the high-affinity iron transport system. By searching an
EST database and screening a human heart cDNA library, they obtained a
cDNA encoding human VPS41. The deduced 854-amino acid protein contains a
C-terminal sequence highly conserved among the VPS41 homologs and also
found in clathrin heavy chain (118955). The non-yeast VPS41 homologs
also have a RING-H2 motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.5-kb
transcript equally expressed in all tissues tested.

MAPPING

Radisky et al. (1997) stated that the EST corresponding to VPS41 maps to
chromosome 14q23. However, Hartz (2009) mapped the VPS41 gene to
chromosome 7p14.1 based on an alignment of the VPS41 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK AK026848) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

600061	TITLE *600061 RAD23, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, A; RAD23A
;;HHR23A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Masutani et al. (1994) reported the purification to homogeneity and
subsequent cDNA cloning from HeLa cells of a repair complex by in vitro
complementation of the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (278720) defect in
a cell-free repair system containing UV-damaged SV40 minichromosomes.
The complex had a high affinity for ssDNA and consisted of 2 tightly
associated proteins of 125 and 58 kD. The 125-kD subunit represented the
previously reported XPC gene (613208) product, which represents the
human homolog of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) gene RAD4 of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The 58-kD species turned out to be a human
homolog of yeast RAD23. Unexpectedly, a second human counterpart of
RAD23 was identified. The 2 genes, which Masutani et al. (1994) referred
to as HHR23A (RAD23A) and HHR23B (RAD23B; 600062), were expressed in the
same cells. In the XPC purification scheme, however, only the RAD23B
protein was found in a complex with p125/XPC.

In the mouse, van der Spek et al. (1996) cloned the homologs of both
RAD23A and RAD23B. Detailed sequence comparisons permitted deductions
concerning the structure of all RAD23 homologs. Northern blot analysis
revealed constitutive expression of both RAD23 genes in all tissues
examined. Elevated RNA expression of both genes was observed in testis.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), van der Spek et al.
(1994) demonstrated that the RAD23A gene is located on 19p13.2.

By FISH, van der Spek et al. (1996) assigned the Rad23a gene to mouse
chromosome 8C3 and the Rad23b gene to mouse chromosome 4B3.

GENE FUNCTION

Masutani et al. (1994) commented that no human mutant defective in
RAD23A had been identified. They suggested that the nature of the defect
in xeroderma pigmentosum group C implies that the XPC-RAD23B complex
exerts a unique function in the genome-overall repair pathway that is
important for prevention of skin cancer.

Van der Spek et al. (1996) found that although the RAD23 equivalents are
well conserved during evolution, the mammalian genes do not express the
UV-inducible phenotype of their yeast counterpart. The authors stated
that this discovery may point to a fundamental difference between the UV
responses of yeast and human.

Machado-Joseph disease (MJD; 109150) is an autosomal dominant
neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine
tract near the C terminus of the MJD1 gene product, ataxin-3. The mutant
ataxin-3 forms intranuclear inclusions in cultured cells as well as in
diseased human brain and also causes cell death in transfected cells.
Using a 2-hybrid system, Wang et al. (2000) found that ataxin-3
interacts with 2 human homologs of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23,
RAD23A and RAD23B. Both normal and mutant ataxin-3 proteins interact
with the ubiquitin-like domain at the N terminus of the RAD23 proteins,
which is a motif important for nucleotide excision repair. However, in
human embryonic kidney cells RAD23 is recruited to intranuclear
inclusions formed by the mutant ataxin-3 through its interaction with
ataxin-3. The authors suggested that this interaction may be associated
with the normal function of ataxin-3, and that some functional
abnormality of the RAD23 proteins may exist in MJD.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050) is a multisystem developmental
disorder caused by the deletion of contiguous genes at chromosome
7q11.23. A common interval that includes as many as 17 genes is deleted
in most patients. Meng et al. (1998) constructed a physical map
encompassing the 1.5-Mb region that is commonly deleted in WBS. They
identified 3 genes within this region, including WBSCR14, which they
designated WS-bHLH. By EST database searching, sequencing, and screening
of a human fetal brain cDNA library, they isolated a partial WBSCR14
cDNA encoding a protein belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix
leucine-zipper family of transcription factors.

De Luis et al. (2000) fully characterized the WBSCR14 gene. They
identified 2 intragenic polymorphic dinucleotide repeats and used them
to verify hemizygosity in WBS patients. They found that the WBSCR14 cDNA
encodes an 852-amino acid protein which, in addition to the bHLH-ZIP
motif, has a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). Northern blot
analysis detected a 4.2-kb transcript predominantly in adult liver and
at late stages of fetal development. De Luis et al. (2000) also cloned
the mouse homolog. Given that other bHLH-ZIP proteins are dose sensitive
and based on the putative function of WBSCR14 as a transcription factor,
de Luis et al. (2000) suggested that hemizygosity at this locus may be
involved in some features of WBS.

Kawaguchi et al. (2002) cloned Chrebp from rat liver. The rat Chrebp
protein shares approximately 94% and 82% identity with mouse and human
WBSCR14, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Cairo et al. (2001) found that WBSCR14 was expressed in multiple
tissues, including regions of the brain and the intestinal tract.
WBSCR14 formed heterodimers with the bHLH-ZIP protein Mlx (602976) to
bind the DNA sequence CACGTG. Like Max (154950), Mlx has no intrinsic
transcriptional activity, but its association with Mad1 (602686), Mad4,
Mnt (603039), or WBSCR14 can repress E-box-dependent transcription.
Preliminary results suggested a possible role of WBSCR14 in growth
control. The authors hypothesized that the Max-like bHLH-ZIP protein,
Mlx, is a key element of a transcription factor network, and that
WBSCR14 may contribute to some aspects of the WBS pathology.

Kawaguchi et al. (2001) noted that rat Chrebp is essential for
activation of the liver pyruvate kinase gene (PKLR; 609712). They stated
that Chrebp is activated by high glucose and is inhibited by cAMP. By
mutation analysis of mouse Chrebp, Kawaguchi et al. (2001) demonstrated
that the N-terminal NLS and the C-terminal bHLH and leucine zipper
domains were essential for transcription of a reporter gene from the PKL
promoter in transfected rat hepatocytes. These 2 domains were targets
for regulation by cAMP and glucose. Kawaguchi et al. (2001) found that
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (see 601639) phosphorylated ser196 near
the NLS, which inactivated nuclear import of Chrebp, and thr666 near the
bHLH domain, which dissociated Chrebp from DNA and inactivated PKL
transcription. On the other hand, high glucose stimulated
dephosphorylation, leading to translocation of Chrebp from the cytosol
into the nucleus, where dephosphorylation led to DNA binding.

Kawaguchi et al. (2002) found that acetate and fatty acids inhibited the
glucose-induced transcription of PKL in Chrebp-transfected rat
hepatocytes. Inhibition was associated with a significant increase in
cytosolic AMP and activation of AMPK (see 602739). They determined that
AMPK phosphorylated Chrebp on ser568, resulting in loss of DNA binding.

Several endocrine phenotypes, in particular impaired glucose tolerance
and silent diabetes, have been described in Williams-Beuren syndrome. A
heterodimeric complex consisting of WBSCR14 and the MAX-like protein
(MLX; 602976), binds and activates, in a glucose-dependent manner,
carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) motifs in the promoter of
lipogenic enzymes. Merla et al. (2004) identified 5 novel
WBSCR14-interacting proteins, 4 14-3-3 isotypes (beta, 601289; gamma,
605356; zeta, 601288; and theta, 609009) and NIF3L1 (605778), which form
a single polypeptide complex in mammalian cells. WBSCR14 was exported
actively from the nucleus through a CRM1-dependent mechanism. This
translocation was contingent upon the ability to bind 14-3-3. The
authors proposed that through this mechanism, the 14-3-3 isotypes may
directly affect the WBSCR14:MLX complexes, which may activate the
transcription of lipogenic genes.

Herman et al. (2012) reported that adipose tissue GLUT4 (138190)
regulates the expression of CHREBP, a transcriptional regulator of
lipogenic and glycolytic genes. Furthermore, adipose CHREBP is a major
determinant of adipose tissue fatty acid synthesis and systemic insulin
sensitivity. Herman et al. (2012) found a new mechanism for glucose
regulation of CHREBP: glucose-mediated activation of the canonical
CHREBP isoform (CHREBP-alpha) induces expression of a novel, potent
isoform (CHREBP-beta) that is transcribed from an alternative promoter.
CHREBP-beta expression in human adipose tissue predicts insulin
sensitivity.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Luis et al. (2000) determined that the WBSCR14 gene contains 17 exons
and spans 33 kb.

MAPPING

Meng et al. (1998) mapped the WBSCR14 gene to the WBS deletion region on
chromosome 7q11.23. De Luis et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Wbscr14 gene
to chromosome 5 in a region of conserved synteny with human 7q11.23.

300873	TITLE *300873 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 3-LIKE PROTEIN; GNL3L
;;GNL3-LIKE PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis and RT-PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Du et al.
(2006) cloned GNL3L, a putative human ortholog of yeast Grn1. Both Grn1
and GNL3L have at least 4 circularly permuted GTPase motifs and a
C-terminal RG stretch predicted to bind RNA. Fluorescence-tagged Grnl
and GNL3L localized predominantly to nucleoli of yeast and COS-7 cells,
respectively.

Meng et al. (2011) noted that the 582-amino acid human GNL3L protein
contains an N-terminal basic region, followed by a basic coiled-coil
domain, a GTP-binding domain, an intermediate region, and a C-terminal
domain. It also has a nucleolar localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Du et al. (2006) found that knockout of Grn1 expression in fission yeast
resulted in growth arrest, failure of cytokinesis, impaired pre-rRNA
processing, and nucleolar accumulation of the ribosomal protein Rpl25a.
When expressed from the yeast Grn1 promoter, human GNL3L completely
complemented Grn1 deletion. Knockdown of GNL3L expression in HeLa cells
also reduced cell proliferation. Du et al. (2006) hypothesized that Grn1
and GNL3L are involved in early 5-prime pre-rRNA processing and/or
assembly and export of precursor ribonucleoprotein complexes from the
nucleolus.

Meng et al. (2011) found that knockdown of GNL3L in human cell lines
triggered G2/M arrest and upregulation of the p53 (TP53; 191170) targets
BAX (600040), 14-3-3-sigma (SFN; 601290), and p21 (CDKN1A; 116899).
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that GNL3L bound directly to and
stabilized MDM2 (164785), a protein that regulates p53 ubiquitination
and proteasome-mediated degradation. GNL3L interacted with MDM2 in the
nucleoplasm and stabilized MDM2 under basal conditions against its
ubiquitination and degradation. In contrast, the GNL3L paralog
nucleostemin (GNL3; 608011) interacts with and stabilizes MDM2 during
cell cycle counting or following cell stress only. However, depletion of
nucleostemin induced a compensatory upregulation of GNL3L in both
p53-expressing and p53-null HCT116 cells. Meng et al. (2011) concluded
that GNL3L is a constitutive regulator of MDM2 stability.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the GNL3L gene to chromosome Xp11.22 based on an
alignment of the GNL3L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK001475) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;LECTIN, C-TYPE, SUPERFAMILY MEMBER 14; CLECSF14;;
MACROPHAGE GALACTOSE-TYPE C-TYPE LECTIN; MGL;;
HML;;
CD301
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin family, such as
CLEC10A, recognize carbohydrate chains and are involved in host defense
mechanisms (Suzuki et al., 1996).

CLONING

By screening an interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680)-activated peripheral blood
monocyte cDNA library with a hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (see
108360) probe, Suzuki et al. (1996) isolated a cDNA encoding HML (human
macrophage lectin). The predicted 292-amino acid type II transmembrane
protein has a cytoplasmic domain with a tyr-glu-asn-phe (YENF)
internalization signal, a transmembrane domain, a neck domain, and a
C-type lectin domain (also called a carbohydrate recognition domain, or
CRD) containing a gln-pro-asp motif. Western blot analysis showed that
HML had an apparent molecular mass of 35 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Suzuki et al. (1996) indicated that HML bound
specifically to galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine in the presence of
calcium.

MAPPING

Gross (2010) mapped the CLEC10A gene to chromosome 17p13.1 based on an
alignment of the CLEC10A sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC027858) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mgl1 and Mgl2 are mouse homologs of human MGL that have distinct binding
specificities. Westcott et al. (2009) examined the impact of
diet-induced obesity on inflammation and metabolism in mice lacking
Mgl1, a marker of alternatively activated macrophages. Mgl1 was not
required for trafficking of antiinflammatory type-2 adipose tissue
macrophages to adipose tissue. Obese Mgl1 -/- mice were protected from
glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and steatosis, despite having
more visceral fat, and this protection was associated with significantly
reduced inflammatory type-1 Cd11c (ITGAX; 151510)-positive macrophages.
FACS analysis revealed that Mgl1 was expressed on inflammatory 7/4(hi)
monocytes, and obese Mgl1 -/- mice had lower levels of 7/4(hi)
monocytes. Westcott et al. (2009) concluded that Mgl1 is a cell surface
receptor involved in the regulation of monocyte/macrophage activation
and trafficking to fat in obesity.

DESCRIPTION The multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first
enzyme complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. See
NDUFA2 (602137). To identify genes expressed in hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells, Mao et al. (1998) sequenced cDNAs from umbilical
cord blood CD34-positive cell libraries. They identified a cDNA encoding
the human homolog of bovine CI-MNLL, a complex I subunit. The predicted
protein contains 58 amino acids.
