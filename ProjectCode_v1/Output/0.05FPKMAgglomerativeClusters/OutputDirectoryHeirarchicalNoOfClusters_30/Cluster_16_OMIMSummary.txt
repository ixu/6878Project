;;KIAA1237
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (1999) obtained a partial HEG1 clone. The transcript
contains a short interspersed element (SINE) in its 3-prime end. RT-PCR
ELISA detected HEG1 expression all tissues examined, with highest
expression in lung, followed by kidney, ovary, heart, brain, and
pancreas. Expression was high in all specific adult brain regions
examined, with highest expression in amygdala, thalamus, subthalamic
nucleus, and caudate nucleus. Fetal brain showed much lower HEG1
expression than adult brain.

By searching databases for orthologs of zebrafish Heg, Mably et al.
(2003) identified a partial human cDNA encoding HEG1. The deduced
1,296-amino acid protein is N-terminally truncated. It has a large
extracellular region containing 2 EGF-like domains, followed by a
C-terminal transmembrane domain and a short intracellular tail. The
deduced full-length 977-amino acid zebrafish Heg protein has a similar
domain structure as human HEG1, and it also contains an N-terminal
signal peptide. Mably et al. (2003) identified 2 other less abundant
splice variants of zebrafish Heg that encode secreted proteins lacking
the transmembrane domain.

Using in situ hybridization, Kleaveland et al. (2009) found that Heg1
was expressed in the endothelium of developing mouse heart and aorta and
in neural tube.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mice and zebrafish lacking Ccm2 (607929) and/or Heg1 (see ANIMAL
MODEL) and CCM2-knockdown human umbilical vein endothelial cells,
Kleaveland et al. (2009) showed that CCM2-HEG1 signaling regulated
endothelial tube formation and endothelial junction formation.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and pull-down assays in transfected
HEK293T cells suggested a model in which HEG1 coupled with CCM2
primarily through interaction with KRIT1 (604214) at endothelial
cell-cell junctions. Loss of both Ccm2 and Heg1 resulted in closed
branching endothelial structures that lacked luminal openings.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the HEG1 gene to chromosome 3q21.2 based on an
alignment of the HEG1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB033063) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

The zebrafish N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutation 'heart of glass'
(heg) is characterized by embryonic lethality with a massively enlarged
heart. The heart enlargement results from abnormal addition of
myocardial cells in a single layer over the endocardium instead of in a
concentric manner, which normally generates myocardial thickening. Using
a positional cloning approach, Mably et al. (2003) identified the Heg
gene and showed that the heg mutation results in a severe truncation
that eliminates most of the protein sequence, including the predicted
EGF repeats. Using selective morpholino perturbation, they showed that
the Heg isoform containing the transmembrane domain was critical for
normal cardiac patterning and growth. Overexpression of all Heg isoforms
in zebrafish resulted in gastrulation defects.

Kleaveland et al. (2009) found that Heg1 deletion in mice resulted in
embryonic and postnatal lethality. At embryonic day 15, Heg1 -/- hearts
showed abnormal invagination of the ventricular cavity and other
structural defects, with blood pooling between the epicardial and
myocardial cell layers. Hearts of neonatal Heg1 -/- mice exhibited
defective cardiac integrity, with rupture of the low-pressure atrial
chamber and blood-filled pericardial sac. Heg1 -/- neonates also showed
dilated intestinal and mesenteric lymphatic vessels that leaked chyle
into the intestinal wall and peritoneal space. Although most Heg1 -/-
mice survived to birth, about half died before weaning as a result of
pulmonary hemorrhage. Embryonic Heg1 -/- mice homozygous for a Ccm2 null
allele had more severe cardiovascular defects and died early in
development due to failure of nascent endothelial cells to associate
into patent vessels. These compound knockout embryos showed complete or
near-complete circulatory block in blood and lymphatic vessels.

MYH11/CBFB FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Matsuoka et al. (1991, 1993) isolated a smooth muscle myosin heavy-chain
gene from a human cDNA library. They confirmed it as a smooth muscle MHC
gene by Northern blot hybridization and a partial DNA sequence analysis.

MAPPING

Deng et al. (1993) mapped the MYH11 gene to the middle of the short arm
of chromosome 16 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Southern blots
of a panel of hybrids containing different portions of human chromosome
16 localized the gene to 16p13.13-p13.12. Studies of DNA from a
CHO/mouse hybrid clone mapping panel showed that the gene was located on
mouse chromosome 16.

GENE FUNCTION

- MYH11/CBFB FUSION GENE

The pericentric inversion inv(16)(p13q22) is a characteristic
abnormality associated with acute myeloid leukemia, most commonly of the
M4Eo subtype. Liu et al. (1993) pinpointed the 16p and 16q breakpoints
by yeast artificial chromosome and cosmid cloning and identified the 2
genes involved in the inversion. On 16p, the MYH11 gene was interrupted;
on 16q, the inversion occurred near the end of the coding region for
CBF-beta (121360), also known as PEBP2-beta, a subunit of a
heterodimeric transcription factor regulating genes expressed in T
cells. In all of 6 inv(16) patients tested, an in-frame fusion messenger
RNA was demonstrated that connected the first 165 amino acids of CBFB
with the tail region of MYH11. The repeated coiled coil of MYH11 may
result in dimerization of the CBFB fusion protein, which in turn would
lead to alterations in transcriptional regulation and contribute to
leukemic transformation.

Castilla et al. (1999) showed that the fusion Cbfb-MYH11 blocks myeloid
differentiation in mice and predisposes the mice to acute myelomonocytic
leukemia when exposed to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), a potent DNA
alkylating mutagen.

Huang et al. (2004), who referred to MYH11 as smooth muscle myosin heavy
chain (SMMHC), investigated the molecular basis for the dominant
inactivation of RUNX1 (151385) by the leukemogenic inversion of
chromosome 16. They showed that, in the PEBP2-beta-SMMHC chimeric
protein, the second heterodimerization domain is created by the fusion
junction, enabling the chimeric protein to interact with RUNX1 at far
greater affinity than PEBP2-beta and inactivate the RUNX1 function. To
explain how heterozygous chimeric protein can inactivate homozygous
RUNX1 near to completion, Huang et al. (2004) proposed a model for the
chimeric protein that consists of a Y-shaped dimer with unpaired
N-terminal halves followed by a coiled-coil for the C-terminal region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Familial clustering of common (isolated) thoracic aortic aneurysm/aortic
dissection (TAAD), one of the most severe cardiovascular conditions in
adults, is heterogeneous, with 1 locus having been mapped to chromosome
16p13.1-p12.2 (AAT4; 132900). The MYH11 gene is located in the critical
linkage region for AAT4. Zhu et al. (2006) performed systematic mutation
screening, which showed 2 heterozygous mutations affecting the same
allele of MYH11 in the French kindred reported by Khau Van Kien et al.
(2004, 2005). The first was a substitution at the splice donor site of
intron 32 and the second was a missense mutation in exon 37, R1758Q
(160745.0001). Both mutations were identified in all subjects carrying
the disease haplotype, but neither was found in 340 normal chromosomes.
A similar mutation analysis in an American family with a combination of
thoracic aortic aneurysm and patent ductus arteriosus (Glancy et al.,
2001) showed a mutation in the MYH11 gene, a deletion of 72 nucleotides
within exon 28 (160745.0002). Zhu et al. (2006) suggested that the
position of the mutations observed in the French and American kindreds
may affect the coiled-coil structure of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain
(SM-MHC) and the assembly of myosin thick filaments. Abnormal
immunologic recognition of SM-MHC and the colocalization of wildtype and
mutant rod proteins in smooth muscle cells in conjunction with
differences in their coimmunoprecipitation capacities strongly suggested
a dominant-negative effect of the mutations.

The ascending aorta is placed under major mechanical stress during each
cardiac cycle. Khau Van Kien et al. (2005) showed in the French kindred
that individuals bearing the disease haplotype showed altered aortic
stiffness parameters: notably, aortic compliance, which serves as an
early marker of the disease. Zhu et al. (2006) extended this study to
49-first degree relatives, showing that aortic diameter was generally
similar in those with and without the mutation, but that the carriers of
the mutation had a lower aortic compliance (66% decrease) and a higher
pulse wave velocity (73% increase; both p less than 0.001). Young
asymptomatic mutation carriers already had aortic indices similar to
those of symptomatic mutation carriers and significantly different from
those of normal relatives of the same age. Thus, Zhu et al. (2006)
concluded that MYH11 heterozygous mutation leads to an early and severe
decrease in the elasticity of the aortic wall consistent with the role
of smooth muscle cells in maintaining the mechanical properties of the
thoracic aorta.

Alhopuro et al. (2008) identified somatic mutations in the MYH11 gene in
56 (56%) of 101 samples of colorectal cancer (114500) tissue showing
microsatellite instability. All mutations were within a mononucleotide
repeat of 8 cytosines (C8) in the last exon of the MYH11 SM2 isoform,
which is susceptible to mutations under microsatellite instability, and
were predicted to lead to a frameshift and elongation of the protein.
All mutations were found within epithelial cells. Analysis of
microsatellite stable tumors identified 2 somatic mutations in the same
tumor that were not in the C8 repeat. Functional expression studies of
the mutant proteins showed unregulated actin-activated motor activity.

Among 32 patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS; 175200) and 66
patients with unspecified hamartomatous polyposis, Alhopuro et al.
(2008) identified 1 PJS patient with a heterozygous germline 1-bp
insertion in the C8 repeat of the MYH11 gene. This mutation was also
identified in the somatic state in a colorectal tumor from an unrelated
patient, but not in 1,015 controls. The patient had a cystic astrocytoma
at age 13 years. At age 23 years, he developed intussusception and was
diagnosed with typical PJS. His unaffected father also carried the
mutation. There was no family history of the disorder, and the patient
did not have a STK11 (602216) mutation. Based on a zebrafish phenotype
(see ANIMAL MODEL), Alhopuro et al. (2008) postulated autosomal
recessive inheritance and the presence of a second unidentified MYH11
mutation.

Pannu et al. (2007) sequenced the MYH11 gene in 3 probands from 3 TAAD
families in which 1 or more members had patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
and in 93 probands from unrelated TAAD families without PDA, and
identified 2 closely linked missense mutations in 1 of the 3 TAAD/PDA
families (160745.0003 and 160745.0004) and a different missense mutation
in another of the 3 TAAD/PDA families (160745.0005). Analysis of aortic
sections and explanted smooth muscle cells from mutation-positive
individuals from both families revealed upregulation of insulin-like
growth factor-1 (IGF1; 147440) but no increase in transforming growth
factor-beta (TGFB; 190180) or downstream targets. Enhanced expression
levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) and markers of
angiotensin II (106150) vascular inflammation, e.g., macrophage
inflammatory proteins 1-alpha (MIP1A; 182283) and 1-beta (MIP1B;
182284), were also found.

ANIMAL MODEL

Major changes in the structure and composition of the ductus arteriosus
occur before and after delivery, and these changes require smooth muscle
cells to migrate, proliferate, differentiate, and contract (Slomp et
al., 1997). Homozygous MYH11 -/- mice deficient in SM-MHC have delay in
closure of the ductus arteriosus (Morano et al., 2000). The
SM-MHC-deficient mice also presented a giant thin-walled bladder and
abnormal intestinal movement. No symptoms of this type were observed in
the affected members with AAT4.

The autosomal recessive Zebrafish meltdown (mlt) lethal phenotype is
characterized by cystic expansion of the posterior intestine as a result
of stromal invasion of nontransformed epithelial cells. Using positional
cloning, Wallace et al. (2005) determined that the mlt phenotype
resulted from a mutation in the Myh11 gene that causes constitutive
activation of the Myh11 ATPase and disruption of smooth muscle cells
surrounding the posterior intestine. The findings implicated an
essential role for smooth muscle signaling in the maintenance of
epithelial architecture.

AORTIC ANEURYSM, FAMILIAL THORACIC 4
MYH11, IVS32, G-T, +1, ARG1758GLN

In the French 'Bourgogne' kindred described by Khau Van Kien et al.
(2004) with familial thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection with patent
ductus arteriosus mapping to chromosome 16p12.2-p13.13 (AAT4; 132900),
Zhu et al. (2006) detected 2 heterozygous mutations affecting the same
allele of the MYH11 gene: a substitution at the splice donor site of
intron 32 (IVS32+1G-T), and a missense mutation in exon 37 (5361G-A)
resulting in a charged amino acid, arginine, being replaced by an
uncharged amino acid, glutamine (R1758Q). The corresponding cDNA
demonstrated that exon 32 was missing, resulting in an in-frame deletion
of 71 amino acids (L1456_N1526del) in the C-terminal region of the
smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC).

.0002
AORTIC ANEURYSM, FAMILIAL THORACIC 4
MYH11, 72-BP DEL

In the American kindred with AAT4 (132900) reported by Glancy et al.
(2001), Zhu et al. (2006) detected a heterozygous 72-nucleotide deletion
within exon 28 of the MYH11 gene (3810_3881del) that was not detected in
340 normal chromosomes. This in-frame deletion corresponds to the loss
of 24 amino acids (R1241_L1264del) in the C-terminal region of the
SM-MHC.

.0003
AORTIC ANEURYSM, FAMILIAL THORACIC 4
MYH11, LEU1264PRO

In affected members of a 3-generation family with aortic aneurysm and
patent ductus arteriosus (AAT4; 132900), Pannu et al. (2007) identified
2 closely linked missense mutations: a 3791T-C transition in the MYH11
gene, resulting in a leu1264-to-pro (L1264P), and a 3824G-T
transversion, resulting in an arg1275-to-leu (R1275L; 160745.0004)
substitution. Both mutations are in the coiled-coil domain.
Cosegregation of the 2 alterations suggested that the mutations are in
linkage disequilibrium.

In affected members of a family with aortic aneurysm and patent ductus
arteriosus (AAT4; 132900), Pannu et al. (2007) identified a 2153C-T
transition in the MYH11 gene, resulting in an arg712-to-gln (R712Q)
substitution in the ATPase head region. The proband's affected father
also had acute myocardial infarction (MI) at age 47 years, and a
mutation-positive brother died of MI at age 43 years.

605729	TITLE *605729 AT-HOOK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR AKNA; AKNA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The AT hook is a small motif with a typical 9-amino acid signature
sequence, in which a glycine-arginine-proline (GRP) tripeptide is the
center of the DNA-binding domain. AT-hook proteins such as ANKA bind
A/T-rich DNA and are thought to modify DNA architecture, thus enhancing
the accessibility of promoters to transcription factors (summary by
Siddiqa et al., 2001).

CLONING

By RT-PCR differential display with RNA from human B-lymphocyte subsets,
Siddiqa et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding AKNA. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 633-amino acid protein contains an AT-hook motif
(RTRGRPADS) and 3 PEST regions. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.0-kb
transcript predominantly in lymphoid tissue, with highest expression in
spleen, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood leukocytes, lower expression
in thymus, and undetectable expression in fetal liver and adult bone
marrow. In addition, AKNA was expressed by B and T lymphocytes, natural
killer cells, and CD1A (188370)-positive/CD14 (158120)-negative
dendritic cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated a nuclear
localization in a B lymphoma transfected with AKNA-GFP.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed expression of AKNA predominantly in
germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs.

GENE FUNCTION

Using cDNA expression array, Northern blot, RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and
Western blot analyses, Siddiqa et al. (2001) observed AKNA-mediated
upregulation of CD40 (109535) expression and downregulation of GSTP1
(134660) expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed AKNA
binding to A/T-rich regulatory elements of CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40LG;
300386), supporting a role for AKNA as a transcription factor that
coordinately regulates a key receptor-ligand pair during secondary
immune responses.

;;ORIGIN RECOGNITION COMPLEX-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; ORCA;;
ORC-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN;;
CENTROMERE PROTEIN 33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LRWD1 appears to have a critical role in assembly of the prereplication
complex and initiation of DNA replication (Shen et al., 2012). LRWD1 may
also serve as a centrosomal protein during spermatogenesis (Teng et al.,
2010).

CLONING

Using microarray analysis to identify genes downregulated in testis of
men with spermatocyte maturation arrest (see 270960) or Sertoli
cell-only syndrome (see 400042), followed by database analysis, Lin et
al. (2006) identified LRWD1. The deduced 647-amino acid protein contains
a leucine-rich repeat domain and a tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat
domain. RT-PCR of 8 human tissues detected LRWD1 expression in testis
only. Similar expression was detected in adult mouse. In mouse testis,
Lrwd1 expression began at postnatal day 35.

Teng et al. (2010) cloned mouse Lrwd1 from a testis cDNA library. The
deduced 648-amino acid protein has an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat
region and 4 C-terminal WD40 domains. Mouse and human LRWD1 share 81.4%
amino acid identity. Northern and Western blot analyses detected Lrwd1
in mouse testis only. The apparent molecular mass of the protein was
about 71 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse testis showed
cytoplasmic Lrwd1 staining in spermatocytes and spermatids. In
spermatozoa, Lrwd1 concentrated in the head-neck region, where the
centrosome is located. Even in mature spermatozoa, Lrwd1 retained its
localization in the head-neck region following loss of an identifiable
centrosome. In a mouse spermatocyte cell line, Lrwd1 colocalized with
gamma-tubulin (see 191135) in the centrosomal region throughout the cell
cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

Using reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis of mouse spermatocytes,
Teng et al. (2010) found that Lrwd1 interacted directly with
gamma-tubulin.

Initiation of DNA replication requires the assembly of a prereplication
complex (pre-RC) in late mitosis and G1, with sequential loading of the
origin recognition complex (see ORC1; 601902), CDC6 (602627), CDT1
(605525), and the MCM2-7 complex (see MCM2; 116945) onto replication
origins. Upon initiation of DNA replication, the pre-RC is disassembled,
and CDT1 and CDC6 are released from the origins to prevent
rereplication. Using human cell lines, Shen et al. (2012) showed that
LRWD1, which they called ORCA, was required for pre-RC assembly and
replication initiation. Knockdown of ORCA via small interfering RNA
reduced association of ORC and MCM2-7 with chromatin and caused failure
of cell cycle progression through S phase. ORCA associated dynamically
with different pre-RC components during the cell cycle: it associated
with ORC and CDT1 at G1, with ORC(2-5) and the CDT1 inhibitor geminin
(GMNN; 602842) in S phase, and with ORC(2-5), phosphorylated CDT1, and
phosphorylated geminin during mitosis. ORCA interacted directly with
ORC2 (601182), CDT1, and geminin, and ORC2 was required for ORCA
stability. Overexpression of geminin reduced the affinity of CDT1 for
ORCA, and loss of association between ORCA and CDT1 appeared to be a key
step in disassembling the pre-RC at the end of G1 phase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lin et al. (2006) determined that the LRWD1 gene contains at least 14
exons and spans about 8.3 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lin et al. (2006) mapped the LRWD1 gene to
chromosome 7q22.1. They mapped the mouse Lrwd1 gene to chromosome 5G2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a consensus sequence of a mouse zinc finger motif as probe,
Pannuti et al. (1988) obtained a partial clone of ZNF3, which they
called cHF.12, from a placenta cDNA library. ZNF3 has at least 6 finger
repeats. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from cell lines of various
tissue origin showed ubiquitous expression of a 3.5-kb transcript.
Expression of ZNF3 was drastically reduced upon terminal differentiation
of 2 human myeloid cell lines.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe isolated from a human liver cDNA library by means of
a mouse DNA segment containing multiple copies of a 7-amino acid zinc
finger domain, for the study of human-hamster cell hybrids, Archidiacono
et al. (1989) showed that one sequence identified by probe A8-51 is
located on chromosome 5.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ZNF3
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP WI-30599).

607606	TITLE *607606 KERATIN 9; KRT9
;;K9
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Langbein et al. (1993) reported the cloning and sequence of the KRT9
gene. The amino acid sequence showed the typical structure of type I
cytokeratins, with a head (153 residues), alpha-helical
coiled-coil-forming rod (306 residues), and tail (163 residues) domains.
(In an erratum, the authors stated that the polypeptide has 623
residues, 154 in the head domain, with a calculated molecular mass of 63
kD.) The keratin 9 protein displayed highest homology to human keratin
10 (148080), not only in the highly conserved rod domain but also in
large parts of the head and tail domains. Expression was confined to
palmar and plantar epidermis. In situ hybridization and
immunolocalization showed expression in subrabasal cell layers.

MAPPING

Hennies et al. (1994) mapped the KRT9 gene to chromosome 17 by PCR
amplification from a chromosome 17-only hybrid. Reis et al. (1994)
refined the assignment of the KRT9 gene to 17q21.1-q21.2 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 unrelated German pedigrees with epidermolytic palmoplantar
keratoderma (EPPK; 144200), including the family originally described by
Thost (1880) and the family previously studied by Reis et al. (1992)
that showed linkage to chromosome 17q11-q23, Reis et al. (1994)
identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the KRT9 gene
(R162W; 607606.0001). Two other missense mutations were also detected in
1 EPPK kindred each, N160K (607606.0004) and R162Q (607606.0005),
respectively. All 3 mutations involved highly conserved residues in coil
1A of KRT9, thought to be important for dimer formation in intermediate
filaments. Reis et al. (1994) noted that the R162W and R162Q mutations
are in the residue corresponding to the arginine that is altered in
KRT14 (R125, see 148066.0002 and 148066.0003) and KRT10 (R156, see
148080.0003 and 148080.0010) in epidermolysis bullosa simplex and
epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, respectively.

In a large 4-generation German EPPK kindred, Hennies et al. (1993, 1994)
identified a missense mutation in the KRT9 gene (Q171P; 607606.0002).

In affected members of a large 4-generation French kindred with EPPK
originally reported by Blanchet-Bardon et al. (1987), in which 8 of 10
affected females over 40 years of age also developed breast or ovarian
cancer, Torchard et al. (1994) identified a missense mutation in the
KRT9 gene (N160Y; 607606.0003). Noting that the KRT9 gene is not
expressed in the mammary gland, Torchard et al. (1994) stated that the
most likely explanation for the association of EPPK with hereditary
breast/ovarian cancer syndrome is that the 2 conditions resulted from
distinct genetic events on chromosome 17q in linked genes.

Kobayashi et al. (1996) obtained experimental evidence that the
arg162-to-gln point mutation (607606.0005) observed in patients with
epidermolytic hereditary palmoplantar keratoderma (Reis et al., 1994)
has a dominant-negative effect on keratin network formation. Transient
transfection of KRT9 cDNA into both epithelial- and epidermal-derived
cell lines showed normal keratin network formation in cells transfected
with normal KRT9 cDNA and disrupted keratin filaments with droplet
formation in cells transfected with the mutant KRT9 cDNA. Kobayashi et
al. (1996) also summarized published reports of mutations in KRT9
associated with EPPK (their Figure 3) and commented that amino acid
residues 156-171, which correspond to the head of the keratin 9
alpha-helical domain, may be crucial for keratin filament assembly and
intermediate filament network formation. (Allelic variants 607606.0001
through 607606.0008 are within the same region of the KRT9 polypeptide
cited by the authors. PMC.)

Covello et al. (1998) studied 4 Northern Irish kindreds with
epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma. Heterozygous missense mutations
in exon 1 of KRT9 were detected in all of the families: met156 to thr
(607606.0010) in 1 family; met156 to val (607606.0006) in 2 kindreds;
and arg162 to gln (607606.0005) in 1 family. Covello et al. (1998) noted
that all reported EPPK mutations had occurred in the helix initiation
motif at the start of the central coiled-coil rod domain of K9.

Kuster et al. (2002) analyzed the KRT9 gene in members of the EPPK
pedigree originally described by Vorner (1901) and identified
heterozygosity for a missense mutation in affected individuals
(607606.0013).

In a family from Shandong Province, China, with autosomal dominant
epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma associated with knuckle pads (see
144200), Lu et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in
the KRT9 gene (L160F; 607606.0012).

In a 5-generation Taiwanese family with EPPK in which 6 of 13 affected
individuals had knuckle pads, Chiu et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for the R163W mutation in the KRT9 gene. The authors
stated that because of renumbering of the KRT9 gene, this mutation was
identical to that previously designated R162W.

In a 4-generation southern Italian family in which 11 of 24 members had
EPPK, 1 of whom also had knuckle pads, Codispoti et al. (2009)
identified the common R163W mutation in the KRT9 gene. Expression of
KRT9 from a knuckle-pad biopsy was found to be increased almost 90-fold
compared to control.

KRT9, ARG163TRP

The numbering of this KRT9 mutation (R163W) is based on the numbering
system used by Lu et al. (2003). Early reports designated this mutation
ARG162TRP.

In 5 unrelated German pedigrees with epidermolytic palmoplantar
keratoderma (EPPK; 144200), including the family originally described by
Thost (1880) and the family previously studied by Reis et al. (1992)
with linkage to chromosome 17q11-q23, Hennies et al. (1993) and Reis et
al. (1994) identified heterozygosity for a C-T transition in exon 1 of
the KRT9 gene, resulting in an arg162-to-trp substitution at a highly
conserved residue in coil 1A of KRT9. The mutation cosegregated
completely with disease in a large 6-generation EPPK family and was not
found in 42 unrelated controls. Haplotype analysis showed that in 3
large EPPK families, the mutation cosegregated with the same haplotype,
whereas the 2 other families carried different mutant haplotypes at the
KRT9 locus, suggesting that the mutation occurred independently on
different haplotypes, or, more probably, that the mutation is not of
recent origin.

Bonifas et al. (1994) found the same R162W mutation in a family with
EPPK previously reported by Berth-Jones and Hutchinson (1989). These
were, however, independent mutations because the R162W mutation reported
by Reis et al. (1994) occurred on an allele with 23 CA repeats in the
microsatellite in intron 4 of the KRT9 gene, whereas the mutant allele
reported by Bonifas et al. (1994) contained 24 CA repeats.

In 13 affected members of a 5-generation Taiwanese family with EPPK, 6
of whom also had knuckle pads (see 144200), Chiu et al. (2007)
identified heterozygosity for the R163W mutation.

In a 4-generation southern Italian family in which 11 of 24 members had
EPPK, 1 of whom also had knuckle pads, Codispoti et al. (2009)
identified heterozygosity for the R163W mutation. Quantitative RT-PCR
analysis of a knuckle-pad skin biopsy revealed an almost 90-fold
increase in KRT9 expression compared to control.

In 4 affected members of a large 4-generation French kindred with
epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (144200), originally reported by
Blanchet-Bardon et al. (1987) and in which 8 of 10 affected females over
40 years of age also developed breast or ovarian cancer, Torchard et al.
(1994) identified an A-T transversion resulting in an asn160-to-tyr
(N160Y) substitution at a conserved residue at the beginning of the rod
domain in the KRT9 gene. The mutation was not found in unaffected family
members or in 20 unrelated controls. Noting that the KRT9 gene is not
expressed in the mammary gland, Torchard et al. (1994) stated that the
most likely explanation for the association of EPPK with hereditary
breast/ovarian cancer syndrome is that the 2 conditions resulted from
distinct genetic events on chromosome 17q in linked genes.

et al. (1994) identified a T-A transversion in exon 1 of the KRT9 gene,
resulting in an asn160-to-lys (N160K) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in coil 1A of KRT9. The mutation was not found in 64 unrelated
controls.

In a family with epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (144200), Reis
et al. (1994) identified a G-A transition in exon 1 of the KRT9 gene,
resulting in an arg161-to-gln (R161Q) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in coil 1A of KRT9. The mutation was not found in 64 unrelated

found an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 532 leading to a substitution
of methionine by valine at codon 156 of the KRT9 gene.

In a family with EPPK (144200) reported by Fritsch et al. (1978),
Bonifas et al. (1994) identified a substitution of serine for
asparagine-160. Two other mutations of the same codon had been
described: asn160-to-tyr (607606.0003) and asn160-to-lys (607606.0004).

The numbering of this KRT9 mutation (L168S) is based on the numbering
system used by Lu et al. (2003). Early reports designated this mutation
LEU167SER. The mutation has also been referred to as L15S.

Rothnagel et al. (1995) searched for mutations in the KRT9 gene in 6
unrelated patients with epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (144200).
In 2 of these, they found mutations that altered critical residues
within the highly conserved helix initiation motif at the beginning of
the rod domain of keratin 9. In a 3-generation Middle Eastern kindred,
they found a C-to-T transition at codon 162 that resulted in an arginine
to tryptophan substitution at position 10 of the 1A alpha-helical
domain, thus confirming this codon as a hotspot for mutation in keratin
9 (see 607606.0001). The other mutation they found involved a T-to-C
transition at codon 167 that resulted in the expression of a serine
residue in place of the normal leucine at position 15 of the 1A segment.

KRT9, LEU160VAL

The numbering of this KRT9 mutation (L160V) is based on the numbering

In a Japanese kindred with epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma
(144200), Endo et al. (1997) identified a C-to-G transversion in
nucleotide 541 of the keratin 9 gene that converted a leucine residue
(CTC) to a valine (GTC) at codon 159. As in all other reported cases of
keratin 9 mutations in EPPK, this mutation was found within the highly
conserved coil 1A of the rod domain, which is considered to play a role
in the correct alignment of the coiled-coil molecules. In this family,
diffuse yellowish hyperkeratosis was limited strictly to the palms and
soles. The first patient presented with symptoms during the first 6
months of life.

(144200), Rugg et al. (2002) detected by denaturing high performance
liquid chromatography a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 508 of the KRT9
gene that resulted in a val170-to-met (V170M) amino acid substitution.

PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, EPIDERMOLYTIC, WITH KNUCKLE PADS
KRT9, LEU160PHE

In a family from Shandong Province, China, with autosomal dominant
epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma associated with knuckle pads (see
144200), Lu et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 544C-T transition in
exon 1 of the KRT9 gene, resulting in a leu160-to-phe (L160F) mutation.
Both the hyperkeratosis and knuckle pads were friction-related. Lu et
al. (2003) stated that aggravation of the hyperkeratosis by friction had
not previously been reported. The right hand of each right-handed
affected member showed more severe hyperkeratosis than the less
frequently used left hand. The knuckle pads on the right hand were
likewise more prominent than those on the left hand. Furthermore, the
knuckle pad on the more frequently used proximal interphalangeal joint
of the index finger was more severely affected than that on the less
frequently used interphalangeal joint of the thumb. One patient showed
EPPK symptoms approximately 5 months after birth, whereas another showed
EPPK symptoms at a little more than 1 year after birth.

in the KRT9 gene, resulting in an asn160-to-ile (N160I) substitution at
a highly conserved residue in the coil-1 A segment at the beginning of
the central rod domain. The mutation was not found in 2 unaffected
family members or in 100 control chromosomes.

607652	TITLE *607652 SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 36; STK36
;;FUSED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; FU;;
KIAA1278
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned STK36, which they designated
KIAA1278. The deduced 1,311-amino acid protein shares about 55% identity
over 795 amino acids with the Drosophila 'fused' (Fu) protein. RT-PCR
ELISA detected expression of STK36 at low to moderate levels in most
tissues tested, but not in adult skeletal muscle and fetal liver.

Using Drosophila Fu as query, Murone et al. (2000) identified an EST
containing STK36, and they used this sequence to screen fetal lung and
adult testis cDNA libraries to obtain the full-length cDNA. The deduced
1,315-amino acid protein shares 55% homology with Drosophila Fu in the
N-terminal kinase domain, but only limited homology over the remaining
1,052 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 5.0-kb transcript
expressed at low levels in most fetal tissues and in adult testis and
ovary. Highest expression was in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Noting that the Drosophila Fu protein modulates the activity of
transcription factors, Murone et al. (2000) characterized the effects of
STK36 on the transcriptional activities of GLI1 (165220), GLI2 (165230),
and GLI3 (165240) in cotransfected mouse mesenchymal stem cells. STK36
did not affect the activity of GLI1 and GLI3, but strongly synergized
with GLI2. Mutation analysis indicated that STK36 lacking the kinase
domain was equally active. Murone et al. (2000) showed that SUFU
(607035) repressed the transcription-enhancing activity of STK36. STK36
coimmunoprecipitated with SUFU, GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3 in cotransfected
293 cells. In the presence of SUFU, about 3% of cells exhibited nuclear
staining of GLI1 or GLI2. When STK36 was introduced, however, about 20%
of cells possessed nuclear GLI1 or GLI2 staining. Murone et al. (2000)
concluded that STK36 controls the activity of GLI1 and GLI2 by opposing
the effect of SUFU.

Wilson et al. (2009) demonstrated that mouse Fu is essential for
construction of the central pair apparatus of motile, 9+2 cilia, and
offers a new model of human primary ciliary dyskinesia (see 244400).
They found that mouse Fu physically interacts with Kif27 (611253), a
mammalian Cos2 ortholog, and linked Fu to known structural components of
the central pair apparatus, providing evidence for the first regulatory
component involved in central pair construction. Wilson et al. (2009)
also demonstrated that zebrafish Fu is required both for hedgehog (see
600725) signaling and cilia biogenesis in Kupffer vesicle. Mouse Fu
rescued both hedgehog-dependent and -independent defects in zebrafish.
Wilson et al. (2009) concluded that their results delineated a new
pathway for central pair apparatus assembly, identified common
regulators of hedgehog signaling and motile ciliogenesis, and provided
insights into the evolution of the hedgehog cascade.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the STK36 gene
to chromosome 2. Murone et al. (2000) stated that they mapped the STK36
gene to chromosome 2q35, close to the PAX3 gene (606597).

ANIMAL MODEL

Fu has an essential role in hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signaling in
Drosophila, and its deletion is embryonic lethal. In contrast, Chen et
al. (2005) found that Fu-deficient mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio. Mutant mice could not be distinguished from wildtype
littermates and appeared to develop normally. However, most Fu-deficient
mice died before 3 weeks of age, apparently of starvation. Histologic
examination showed no significant morphologic changes, and expression
studies revealed no changes in hedgehog signaling. Chen et al. (2005)
concluded that Fu does not have an essential role in hedgehog signaling
in vertebrates.

613904	TITLE *613904 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 569; ZNF569
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF569 belongs to a large family of transcription factors characterized
by an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and tandem
C-terminal C2H2-type zinc fingers (Huang et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using the KRAB domain consensus sequence to search EST databases,
followed by PCR of an early embryonic human heart cDNA library, Huang et
al. (2006) cloned ZNF569. The deduced 686-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 79.6 kD. It has a classical N-terminal
KRAB-A domain, followed by 18 tandem Kruppel C2H2-type zinc fingers
extending to the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of a 2.06-kb ZNF569 transcript in adult heart, skeletal
muscle, and liver and in fetal heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. It was
also expressed more weakly in adult and fetal pancreas and placenta,
with little to no expression detected in other tissues.
Fluorescence-tagged ZNF569 localized predominantly to nuclei of
transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By cotransfecting COS-7 cells with ZNF569 and a reporter gene system,
Huang et al. (2006) showed that ZNF569 suppressed the endogenous
transcriptional activities of the serum response element (SRE) and AP1
(165160). Domain analysis revealed that both the KRAB domain and the
zinc finger motifs of ZNF569 suppressed transcriptional activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huang et al. (2006) determined that the ZNF569 gene contains 6 exons and
spans approximately 56.3 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Huang et al. (2006) mapped the ZNF569 gene
to chromosome 19q13.12.
