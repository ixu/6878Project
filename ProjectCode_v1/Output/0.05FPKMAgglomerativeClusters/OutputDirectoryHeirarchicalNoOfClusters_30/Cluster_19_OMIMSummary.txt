;;LUCA15;;
G15
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Timmer et al. (1999) identified a YAC clone corresponding to chromosome
3p21.3 that is deleted in the small cell lung cancer cell line GLC20.
They isolated and cloned RBM5 by direct hybridization of this YAC clone
to a pre-B-cell cDNA library. The deduced 815-amino acid protein
contains 2 RNA-binding motifs, a C2C2-type zinc finger motif, a
C2H2-type zinc finger motif, and a bipartite nuclear signal. The same
functional motifs are found in RBM6 (606886), as has also been reported
by Gure et al. (1998), and the 2 proteins share 30% amino acid identity.
Northern blot analysis of multiple tissues detected expression of 7.4-
and 3.5-kb transcripts in all tissues investigated. Although the RBM5
gene is located in a region considered critical for the development of
lung cancer, Northern and Southern analyses of a number of lung cancer
cell lines revealed no patterns of aberrant RBM5 expression.

By physical cloning methodologies and bioinformatic computational
analyses, Lerman and Minna (2000) identified a number of genes,
including RBM5, which they called G15, in a region of chromosome 3p21.3
that is associated with a putative lung cancer tumor suppressor gene.
The mouse ortholog is 97% identical on the protein level. Northern blot
analysis detected wide expression in normal and lung cancer tissues and
cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Drabkin et al. (1999) found that recombinant proteins containing the RNA
recognition motifs of RBM5 or RBM6 specifically bind poly(G) RNA
homopolymers in vitro.

Lerman and Minna (2000) identified no mutations in the RBM5 gene in lung
cancer cell lines. They concluded that RBM5 is an unlikely candidate as
a tumor suppressor gene.

Oh et al. (2002) found that the RBM5 gene, which they called H37, showed
reduced expression in 9 of 11 primary nonsmall cell lung cancers when
compared with adjacent normal bronchial cells. Introduction of H37 cDNA
into human breast cancer cells with deletion of 3p22-p21 reduced both
anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth in vitro. They
concluded that H37 may have a role as a tumor suppressor gene in human
lung cancer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Timmer et al. (1999) determined that the RBM5 gene contains 25 exons. By
genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) detected only 18
exons in the 18.5-kb RBM5 gene.

MAPPING

Timmer et al. (1999) identified the RBM5 gene within a YAC clone
corresponding to chromosome 3p21.3.

605255	TITLE *605255 ETS VARIANT GENE 7; ETV7
;;ETS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TEL2; TEL2;;
TELB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family of transcription factors,
of which ETV7 is a member, is a large group of evolutionarily conserved
transcriptional regulators that play an important role in a variety of
cellular processes throughout development and differentiation, and are
involved in oncogenesis as well (Potter et al., 2000).

CLONING

Potter et al. (2000) sequenced cDNA clones corresponding to a novel ETS
gene from an activated T-cell cDNA library, as well as from breast
tissue and meningioma cDNA libraries. The cDNA, which the authors
designated TEL2, encodes a deduced 341-amino acid protein that shares
38% sequence identity with TEL1 (ETV6; 600618). TEL2 contains a
C-terminal ETS domain and an N-terminal PNT domain, which is thought to
mediate protein-protein interactions. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of TEL2 mRNA predominantly in hematopoietic tissues; a
predominant band of approximately 1.2 kb was present in fetal liver and
bone marrow and was faintly present in peripheral blood leukocytes.
Using antibodies raised against the C terminus of the TEL2 protein,
Potter et al. (2000) showed that TEL2 localizes to the nucleus. The
striking similarities of TEL2 to TEL1, its expression in hematopoietic
tissues, and its ability to associate with TEL1 suggested that TEL2 may
be an important hematopoietic regulatory protein.

Poirel et al. (2000) identified the TELB gene by comparison of the TEL
sequence with genomic sequence databases. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of TELB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Potter et al. (2000) determined that the TEL2 gene contains 8 exons
spanning approximately 21 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by inclusion within a PAC
clone, Potter et al. (2000) mapped the TEL2 gene to chromosome 6p21.

Poirel et al. (2000) mapped the TELB gene to 6p21 by genomic sequence
analysis.

DESCRIPTION Yoshiura et al. (1998) identified a family in which cleft lip and palate
(119530) segregated in 2 of 3 generations with a balanced chromosomal
translocation t(2;19)(q11.2;q13.3). They identified a novel gene on
chromosome 19, which they named 'cleft lip- and palate-associated
transmembrane protein-1' (CLPTM1), by positional cloning. Assembled cDNA
sequences and comparison with genomic sequences predicted a gene with 13
exons encoding a putative protein with 7 transmembrane domains highly
conserved between human and C. elegans. Yoshiura et al. (1998) found
ubiquitous expression of a 2.6-kb transcript using Northern blot
analysis of various adult human tissues and whole-mount in situ
hybridization to day 10-12 postconception mouse embryos. Using SSCP
analysis in sporadic cases of clefting and direct sequencing of coding
sequences in familial cases, Yoshiura et al. (1998) identified no
pathologic mutations.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse 11-day-old embryo library using
human DLG2 (603583) SH3 and GK domains as bait, Kawabe et al. (2001)
cloned mouse Tjap1, which they called Pilt. By database analysis, they
identified full-length human TJAP1, which encodes a 547-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60.7 kD. TJAP1 contains an
N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a central proline-rich region, and
shares 74% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. TJAP1 shares 43%
and 51% amino acid identity over its N-terminal and C-terminal regions,
respectively, with the same regions of BEGAIN. SDS-PAGE detected TJAP1
as an 86-kD band. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately
3.0-kb transcript in all 16 human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence microscopy of mouse mammary tumor cells, Kawabe et
al. (2001) localized TJAP1 to cell-cell junctions where it colocalized
with ZO-1 (TJP1; 601009) at tight junctions. Using endogenous and stably
expressed TJAP1, the authors confirmed colocalization of TJAP1 and ZO-1
to tight junctions in small intestine cells where TJAP1 localized to the
Golgi complex. TJAP1 was absent from apical junctions and desmosomes. By
observing TJAP1 incorporation into cell-cell junctions over time in a
mouse wound healing model, the authors showed that TJAP1 was
incorporated into tight junctions at the very late stages of cell-cell
junction formation. Kawabe et al. (2001) used GST pull-down assays to
confirm that TJAP1 binds DLG2. Immunohistochemical studies using
cadherin deficient L-cells expressing claudin-1 (CLDN1; 603718) or JAM
(JAM1; 605721) showed no evidence of interaction between TJAP1 and
either of these 2 proteins.

;;MESODERM DEVELOPMENT GENE; MESD;;
KIAA0081;;
BOCA, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; BOCA
MESDC2/SENP1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
the human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, Nagase et al. (1995) isolated
a cDNA encoding MESDC2, which they designated KIAA0081. The predicted
233-amino acid protein contains at least 1 putative transmembrane
region. Northern blot analysis detected expression in all tissues tested
except peripheral blood leukocytes.

Wines et al. (2001) cloned mouse Mesdc2, which encodes a 223-amino acid
protein that shares 82% identity with the 234-amino acid human protein.
MESDC2 was predicted to have an N-terminal transmembrane domain.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.8-kb transcript in mouse embryos
throughout development and in all adult mouse tissues tested, except
skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Hsieh et al. (2003) demonstrated that Mesdc2, a gene identified in the
mesoderm development (Mesd) deletion interval on mouse chromosome 7, is
essential for specification of embryonic polarity and mesoderm
induction. They determined that the patterning and cell differentiation
defects observed in Mesd deletion homozygotes result solely from loss of
the Mesdc2 gene, and therefore they renamed the gene Mesd. Hsieh et al.
(2003) showed that Mesd functions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a
specific chaperone for Lrp5 (603506) and Lrp6 (603507), which in
conjunction with frizzled (see 603408) are coreceptors for canonical Wnt
signal transduction. The authors proposed that disruption of embryonic
polarity and mesoderm differentiation in Mesd-deficient embryos likely
results from a primary defect in Wnt signaling. However, phenotypic
differences between Mesd-deficient and Wnt3 (165330) -/- embryos
suggested that Mesd may function on related members of the LDLR family.
LDLR family members mediate diverse cellular processes ranging from
cargo transport to signaling.

Culi and Mann (2003) described boca, an evolutionarily conserved gene in
Drosophila melanogaster that encodes an ER protein homologous to the
mouse Mesdc2 protein. They showed that boca is specifically required for
the intracellular trafficking of members of the LDLR family. Two LDLRs
in flies, arrow (see 603507), which is required for wingless signal
transduction, and yolkless, which is required for yolk protein uptake
during oogenesis, were found to require boca function. Culi and Mann
(2003) concluded that boca is an essential component of the wingless
pathway but is more generally required for the activities of multiple
LDLR family members.

Veltman et al. (2005) identified a patient with an infantile
sacrococcygeal teratoma and a constitutional t(12;15)(q13;q25)
chromosomal translocation, resulting SENP1 (612157)/MESDC2 fusion gene.
Both reciprocal SENP1/MESDC2 (SEME) and MESDC2/SENP1 (MESE) fusion genes
were transcribed in tumor-derived cells, and their open reading frames
encoded aberrant proteins. In contrast to wildtype MESDC2, the
translocation-associated SEME protein was no longer targeted to the
endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a presumed loss-of-function as a
chaperone for the WNT coreceptors LRP5 (603506) and/or LRP6 (603507).
SUMO, a posttranslational modifier, plays an important role in several
cellular key processes and is cleaved from its substrates by wildtype
SENP1. In vitro studies revealed that translocation-associated MESE
proteins exhibited desumoylation capacities similar to those observed
for wildtype SENP1. Veltman et al. (2005) speculated that spatiotemporal
disturbances in desumoylating activities during critical stages of
embryonic development might be responsible for teratoma formation. The
constitutional t(12;15)(q13;q25) translocation suggested SENP1 and
MESDC2 as candidate genes for neonatal/infantile germ cell tumor
development.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the MESDC2 gene to chromosome 15 by analysis
of human-rodent hybrid cell lines.

By radiation hybrid analysis and sequencing a BAC contig, Wines et al.
(2001) mapped the MESCD2 gene to chromosome 15q23-q25. They mapped the
mouse Mesdc2 gene to a region of chromosome 7 that shares homology of
synteny with human chromosome 15q23-q25.

Veltman et al. (2005) stated that the MESDC2 gene maps to chromosome
15q25.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wines et al. (2001) identified Mesdc2 within a region of mouse
chromosome 7 that, when deleted, results in failure to form mesoderm and
embryonic lethality.

HYPERTENSION-RELATED CALCIUM-REGULATED GENE; HCARG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Solban et al. (2000) cloned rat Hcarg from a cDNA library constructed
from the spontaneously hypertensive rat parathyroid gland. The deduced
224-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 22.5 kD.
Hcarg has a 67% alpha helix content, a calcium-binding EF-hand motif, 4
putative leucine zipper motifs, a nuclear receptor-binding domain, and
no transmembrane domain. It also contains several putative
phosphorylation sites and an N-glycosylation site. Using rat Hcarg as
probe, Solban et al. (2000) cloned human HCARG from a vascular smooth
muscle cell cDNA library. The deduced 224-amino acid protein shares 80%
homology with rat Hcarg. Multiple-tissue expression array analysis
detected high expression in heart, stomach, jejunum, kidney, liver, and
adrenal gland. Expression was generally higher in adult organs than in
fetal tissues, particularly in heart, kidney, and liver. In situ
hybridization of rat tissues detected expression in the medulla and zona
fasciculata of the adrenal cortex and in the tubules of the kidney, but
showed no expression in renal glomeruli. Immunofluorescence microscopy
of transfected COS-7 cells and immunohistochemical staining of rat
pituitary detected Hcarg predominantly localized to the nucleus, with
some staining at sites of protein synthesis.

GENE FUNCTION

Solban et al. (2000) found that expression of Hcarg was higher in the
adrenal cortex and kidney tubules of hypertensive rats compared with
their normotensive controls. Rat Hcarg inhibited cell proliferation in
human embryonic kidney cells following transfection.

MAPPING

gene to chromosome 8q24.3.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are capable of producing a free
ubiquitin moiety from ubiquitin-fused precursors and ubiquitylated
proteins in cells. DUBs possess conserved catalytic regions known as the
'cys domain' and the 'his domain.' There are 2 distinct families of
DUBs: ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (UBPs, or USPs) and
ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs).

CLONING

By computerized sequence analysis of human fetal brain cDNAs, Fujiwara
et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding a novel UBP family member,
which they designated USP1 (ubiquitin-specific protease-1). The
predicted 785-amino acid USP1 protein contains a cys domain and a his
domain, as well as conserved asp and KRF domains. Recombinant USP1
protein exhibited UBP activity.

MAPPING

By analysis of radiation hybrids and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Fujiwara et al. (1998) mapped the USP1 gene to
1p32.1-p31.3.

601683	TITLE *601683 COQ7, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; COQ7
;;CLK1, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the nematode C. elegans, the activity of clk1 controls the rate of
worm development, the pace of behaviors, and the time of death. Ewbank
et al. (1997) identified the C. elegans clk1 gene. They showed that the
predicted 187-amino acid clk1 protein is conserved among eukaryotes,
including humans, and they cloned partial cDNAs representing the human
and mouse homologs. The clk1 protein is structurally similar to the S.
cerevisiae metabolic regulator Cat5 (also called Coq7). These proteins
contain a tandem duplication of a core 82-residue domain.

Asaumi et al. (1999) cloned the mouse homolog of clk1, designated Coq7.
They cloned the human COQ7 cDNA by screening a liver cDNA library with
the mouse cDNA as probe. Human COQ7 encodes a deduced 217-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 24.3 kD. The protein shares
85%, 89%, 53%, and 37% sequence identity with orthologs from mouse, rat,
C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae, respectively. COQ7 transfected into COS-7
cells shows a single band of about 25 kD by Western blot analysis.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 0.9-kb COQ7 transcript
in heart and skeletal muscle, with barely detectable expression in
brain, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas.

Takahashi et al. (2001) cloned Coq7 from a mouse diaphragm cDNA library
and found that the deduced 217-amino acid protein has an N-terminal,
38-residue mitochondria targeting sequence. Immunofluorescence
localization of Coq7 revealed punctate staining in the cytoplasm of
skeletal muscle and heart muscle, in smooth muscle cells surrounding
small blood vessels, and in renal tubule cells. Coq7 transfected into
COS-7 cells gave a punctate staining pattern consistent with
mitochondrial localization, and transfection with Coq7 lacking the
putative mitochondria targeting sequence led to diffuse cytoplasmic
staining.

Vajo et al. (1999) cloned COQ7 from human heart. They found that the
predicted protein contains 179 amino acids, is mostly helical, and
contains an alpha-helical membrane insertion. It has a potential
N-glycosylation site, a phosphorylation site for protein kinase C and
another for casein kinase II, and 3 N-myristoylation sites. Northern
blot analysis detected 3 transcripts; a 1-kb transcript was predominant
in heart, and a 3-kb transcript was predominant in skeletal muscle,
kidney, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Ewbank et al. (1997) noted that the timing of a wide range of
physiologic processes is deregulated and the life span is extended in C.
elegans clk1 mutants. Mutations in clk1, clk2 (TELO2; 611140), clk3, and
gro1 interact genetically to affect developmental rate and longevity.
They demonstrated that the clk1 gene complemented the clk1 phenotypes
and restored normal longevity. They also showed that clk1 complements
the phenotype of S. cerevisiae Cat5/Coq7 null mutants, demonstrating
that the 2 genes share biochemical function and that clk1 acts at the
level of cellular physiology.

In yeast, Coq7/Cat5 is essential for several metabolic pathways,
including ubiquinone biosynthesis, respiration, and gluconeogenic gene
activation. Jonassen et al. (1998) demonstrated that the Coq7/Cat5 gene
product is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein directly involved in
ubiquinone biosynthesis. They showed that the defect in gluconeogenic
gene activation in coq7/cat5 null mutants is a general consequence of a
defect in respiration. Jonassen et al. (1998) stated that these results
obtained in the yeast model suggest that the effects on development and
life span in C. elegans clk1 mutants may relate to changes in the amount
of ubiquinone, an essential electron transport component and a
lipid-soluble antioxidant.

Guarente (1997) discussed the relevance of the studies in yeast and
nematode to the understanding of human aging.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR amplification and Southern blot analysis on human genomic DNA,
Asaumi et al. (1999) determined that the COQ7 gene contains 6 exons and
spans 11 kb. Analysis of the putative promoter region revealed an Alu-J
subfamily consensus sequence, and CAAT box- and TATA box-like sequences.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and radiation
hybrid analysis, Asaumi et al. (1999) mapped the COQ7 gene to chromosome
16p12.3-p11. By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Vajo et al. (1999)
mapped the gene to 16p13.1-p12.

601558	TITLE *601558 RNA-BINDING PROTEIN GENE WITH MULTIPLE SPLICING; RBPMS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shimamoto et al. (1996) established a 1.3-Mb physical map spanning the
Werner syndrome (WRN; 277700) region on chromosome 8p and identified a
unique gene that they called RBPMS. The single-copy RBPMS gene is
alternatively spliced, resulting in at least 12 transcripts with an
average length of 1.5 kb. Nine different types of cDNAs encoding an
N-terminal RNA-binding motif homologous to that of the Drosophila 'couch
potato' protein and C-terminal helix-rich sequences were identified.
Northern blot analysis showed that the RBPMS gene was expressed strongly
in heart, prostate, intestine, and ovary, and poorly in skeletal muscle,
spleen, thymus, brain, and peripheral leukocytes. Shimamoto et al.
(1996) noted evidence that alternative splicing of RBPMS was regulated
in a tissue-specific fashion.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid screens, coaffinity purification analysis of
transfected HEK293 cells, and bioinformatic analysis, Lim et al. (2006)
developed an interaction network for 54 human proteins involved in 23
inherited ataxias. By database analysis, they expanded the core network
to include more distantly related interacting proteins that could
function as genetic modifiers. ATXN1 (601556) showed a strong direct
interaction with RBPMS, and the N-terminal portion of ATXN1 was required
for interaction with RBPMS. RBPMS was a main hub in the network and
interacted with many proteins, including 2 cerebellar ataxia-associated
proteins, ATN1 (607462) and QK1 (609590).

GENE STRUCTURE

Shimamoto et al. (1996) determined that the RBPMS gene contains 16 exons
and spans at least 230 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Shimamoto et al. (1996) mapped the RBPMS
gene to chromosome 8p12-p11.

113505	TITLE *113505 BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; BDNF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BDNF is a prosurvival factor induced by cortical neurons that is
necessary for survival of striatal neurons in the brain (Zuccato et al.,
2001).

For background information on neurotrophins and their receptors, see
NGFR (162010).

CLONING

Jones and Reichardt (1990) noted that during normal vertebral
development, up to 80% of the neurons in diverse cell populations within
the forming nervous system die. This is thought to be a mechanism that
ensures that adequate numbers of neurons establish appropriate
innervation densities with effector organs or other neuronal
populations. In several instances, the innervation target of a
population of neurons has been shown to have a crucial role in
regulating the number of surviving neurons. Targets of neuronal
innervation produce a limited supply of neurotrophic factors, and
competition between neurons responsive to these factors determines which
neurons survive. In addition to nerve growth factor (NGF; 162030), BDNF
has been purified and shown in vivo to reduce the amount of naturally
occurring neuronal cell death in portions of the peripheral nervous
system (Hofer and Barde, 1988).

Jones and Reichardt (1990) cloned human BDNF, which encodes a deduced
247 preproprotein that is proteolytically processed into a mature
119-amino acid protein. The mature BDNF protein shares 100% identity
with mature porcine Bdnf and 52% identity with mature human NGF.
Northern blot analysis detected BDNF transcripts of 1.6 and 4.0 kb in
all brain regions examined.

Maisonpierre et al. (1991) cloned the human and rat genes encoding BDNF.
They demonstrated that the mature form was identical in all mammals
examined. Furthermore, the tissue distributions and neuronal
specificities are conserved among mammals.

By database analysis and RT-PCR, Liu et al. (2005) identified 9
alternatively spliced BDNF transcripts. The transcripts differ in their
use of alternative promoters, alternative splice donor and acceptor
sites, and alternative polyadenylation sites. Most transcripts encode
the previously identified proBDNF; however, 2 transcripts contain
additional in-frame methionines that may result in proteins with longer
N termini, and another transcript encodes a protein with an internal
deletion of 48 amino acids. RT-PCR revealed a complex pattern of BDNF
transcripts in brain and a more simple pattern of expression in
peripheral tissues. Liu et al. (2005) also identified noncoding RNAs
transcribed from a gene that overlaps with BDNF on the opposite strand
(BDNFOS; 611468).

By in silico analysis, RT-PCR of adult frontal cerebral cortex, medulla,
and hippocampus total RNA, and 5-prime RACE of adult hippocampus and
cerebellum RNA, Pruunsild et al. (2007) identified numerous BDNF
transcripts. The transcripts differ in the length of their 5-prime UTR,
and most encode proBDNF. RT-PCR detected tissue-specific expression of
BDNF variants. Most showed highest expression in brain, although several
alternative transcripts showed relatively high expression in nonneural
tissues. The BDNF variants showed variable expression in all specific
brain regions examined, and all were expressed at high levels in
mammillary body, pons, hippocampus, frontal cortex, colliculi, and
olfactory tract.

By examining expression of Bdnf transcripts in rat and mouse brain, An
et al. (2008) found that mRNAs with short 3-prime UTRs were restricted
to somata, whereas those with long 3-prime UTRs also localized to
dendrites.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pruunsild et al. (2007) determined that the BDNF gene contains 11 exons
and spans about 70 kb. They identified transcription start sites in 9
exons, each of which was associated with a functional promoter.

MAPPING

Maisonpierre et al. (1991) localized the BDNF gene to 11p13. Ozcelik et
al. (1991) also mapped BDNF to human chromosome 11p15.5-p11.2 by
analysis of somatic cell hybrids. They assigned the mouse gene to
chromosome 2. By deletion analysis of somatic cell hybrids containing
human chromosome 11 with deletion or translocation breakpoints, Hanson
et al. (1992) showed that BDNF maps between FSHB (136530) and HVBS1
(114550) at the boundary of 11p13 and 11p14.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen and Weber (2001) conducted experiments to determine whether BDNF,
which is a neuroprotectant in the small rat eye, might also serve as an
effective neuroprotectant in larger vertebrate eyes. They used a cat
optic nerve crush model; the non-BDNF-injected eye served as control.
Their data showed that BDNF is an effective neuroprotectant in
primate-sized eyes after optic nerve injury. High doses of BDNF induced
inflammation and resulted in a decrease in total ganglion cell survival
but appeared necessary to save medium-sized neurons that are affected
most severely by nerve injury.

Lu et al. (2001) showed that SDF1 (600835) and BDNF are chemoattractants
for cerebellar granule cells.

Zuccato et al. (2001) demonstrated that wildtype huntingtin (HTT;
613004) upregulates transcription of BDNF. They showed that this
beneficial activity of huntingtin is lost when the protein becomes
mutated, resulting in decreased production of cortical BDNF. This leads
to insufficient neurotrophic support for striatal neurons, which then
die. Zuccato et al. (2001) suggested that restoring wildtype huntingtin
activity and increasing BDNF production may be therapeutic approaches
for treating Huntington disease (HD; 143100).

Gauthier et al. (2004) showed that huntingtin specifically enhances
vesicular transport of BDNF along microtubules. They determined that
huntingtin-mediated transport involves huntingtin-associated protein-1
(HAP1; 600947) and the p150(Glued) (601143) subunit of dynactin, an
essential component of molecular motors. BDNF transport was attenuated
both in the disease context and by reducing the levels of wildtype
huntingtin. The alteration of the huntingtin/HAP1/p150(Glued) complex
correlated with reduced association of motor proteins with microtubules.
The polyglutamine-huntingtin-induced transport deficit resulted in the
loss of neurotrophic support and neuronal toxicity. Gauthier et al.
(2004) concluded that a key role of huntingtin is to promote BDNF
transport and suggested that loss of this function might contribute to
pathogenesis.

Although proneurotrophins have been considered inactive precursors, Lee
et al. (2001) demonstrated that the proforms of NGF and the proforms of
BDNF are secreted and cleaved extracellularly by the serine protease
plasmin (173350) and by selective matrix metalloproteinases (MMP7,
178990; MMP3, 185250). ProNGF is a high-affinity ligand for p75(NTR)
(NGFR; 162010), and induced p75(NTR)-dependent apoptosis in cultured
neurons with minimal activation of TRKA (191315)-mediated
differentiation or survival. The biologic action of neurotrophins is
thus regulated by proteolytic cleavage, with proforms preferentially
activating p75(NTR) to mediate apoptosis and mature forms activating TRK
receptors to promote survival.

By imaging dentate granule cells in mouse hippocampal slices, Kovalchuk
et al. (2002) identified BDNF-evoked calcium transients in dendrites and
spines, but not at presynaptic sites. Pairing a weak burst of synaptic
stimulation with a brief dendritic BDNF application caused an immediate
and robust induction of long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation
induction required activation of postsynaptic calcium channels and NMDA
receptors and was prevented by the blockage of postsynaptic calcium
transients. Kovalchuk et al. (2002) concluded that BDNF-mediated
long-term potentiation is induced postsynaptically, and that the
observation that dendritic spines are the exclusive synaptic sites for
rapid BDNF-evoked calcium signaling supports this conclusion.

Ming et al. (2002) found that axonal growth cones of cultured frog
spinal neurons exhibit adaptation during chemotactic migration,
undergoing consecutive phases of desensitization and resensitization in
the presence of increasing basal concentrations of the guidance factors
Ntn1 (601614) or Bdnf1. Ntn1- or Bdnf1-specific desensitization was
accompanied by a reduction of calcium signaling, whereas resensitization
required activation of Mapk and local protein synthesis. Ming et al.
(2002) suggested that the protracted nature of this process allows
adaptive changes in the sensitivity of the growth cone and that the
adaptive behavior exemplifies the image of the growth cone as a
chemotaking amoeba, as proposed in the 19th century by Ramon y Cajal.

Using quantitative RT-PCR analysis in cultured rat cortical neurons, Tao
et al. (2002) demonstrated that the induction of BDNF exon 3 expression
is selectively activated by calcium influx specifically in neurons. They
used mutagenesis to identify calcium-responsive enhancer elements within
the BDNF promoter III, which they named CaRE1 and CaRE2. Tao et al.
(2002) found that CaRE1 is required for membrane depolarization-mediated
induction of a BDNF promoter III reporter gene in neurons in a calcium-
and neural-selective manner. Using a yeast 1-hybrid screen to clone
CaRE1-binding proteins, Tao et al. (2002) identified the calcium
response factor gene (CARF; 607586). They hypothesized that CARF is a
neuronal, calcium-regulated transcriptional activator of BDNF exon 3
expression.

In cell cultures of rat sympathetic neurons innervating cardiac
myocytes, Yang et al. (2002) showed that BDNF rapidly (within 15
minutes) shifted the neurotransmitter release properties of the neurons
from excitatory to inhibitory cholinergic transmission in response to
neural stimulation via the presynaptic p75 neurotrophin receptor
(162010).

Chen et al. (2003) found that MECP2 (300005) binds selectively to BDNF
promoter III and functions to repress expression of the BDNF gene.
Membrane depolarization triggers the calcium-dependent phosphorylation
and release of MECP2 from BDNF promoter III, thereby facilitating
transcription. Chen et al. (2003) concluded that MECP2 plays a key role
in the control of neuronal activity-dependent gene regulation and that
the deregulation of this process may underlie the pathology of Rett
syndrome (312750).

Martinowich et al. (2003) reported that increased synthesis of BDNF in
mouse neurons after depolarization correlates with a decrease in CpG
methylation within the regulatory region of the BDNF gene. Moreover,
increased BDNF transcription involves dissociation of the MECP2-histone
deacetylase-(see 601241)-Sin3A (607776) repression complex from its
promoter. Martinowich et al. (2003) concluded that DNA
methylation-related chromatin remodeling is important for
activity-dependent gene regulation that may be critical for neural
plasticity. Martinowich et al. (2003) proposed a model in which DNA
methylation and its related chromatin remodeling play critical roles in
regulating gene transcription in response to neuronal activity. CpG
methylation at any critical site may increase the likelihood of MECP2
binding, which can recruit histone deacetylases and the H3-K9
methyltransferase to mediate inactive chromatin remodeling, or may
directly induce chromatin compaction to repress gene expression.

In a rat model, Baker-Herman et al. (2004) found that intermittent
hypoxia, but not carotid body denervation or hypercapnia, elicited a
serotonin-mediated increase in BDNF in the spinal cord. The increase in
BDNF was necessary and sufficient for spinal respiratory plasticity and
respiratory long-term facilitation. Evidence suggested that BDNF elicits
the response through the TrkB receptor (600456). RNA interference (RNAi)
targeted against BDNF mRNA inhibited the effect.

The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat is a widely studied, classic
model of recessively inherited retinal degeneration in which the retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) fails to phagocytose shed outer segments, and
photoreceptor cells subsequently die. Lawrence et al. (2004) found that
engineered Schwann cells sustained retinal structure and function in the
RCS rat. Cells overexpressing glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF; 600837) or BDNF had a greater effect on photoreceptor
survival than the parent line or sham surgery. The authors concluded
that their study demonstrated that ex vivo gene therapy and subsequent
cell transplantation could be effective in preserving photoreceptors
from the cell death that normally accompanies retinal degeneration.

Du and Poo (2004) demonstrated that rapid retrograde synaptic
modification exists in an intact developing retinotectal system. Local
application of BDNF to the Xenopus laevis optic tectum, which induced
persistent potentiation of retinotectal synapses, led to a rapid
modification of synaptic inputs at the dendrites of retinal ganglion
cells, as shown by a persistent enhancement of light-evoked excitatory
synaptic currents and spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells. This
retrograde effect required TrkB receptor activation, phospholipase
C-gamma (see 172420) activity, and calcium elevation in retinal ganglion
cells, and was accounted for by a selective increase in the number of
postsynaptic AMPA-subtype glutamate receptors at retinal ganglion cell
dendrites. Such retrograde information flow in the neuron allows rapid
regulation of synaptic inputs at the dendrite in accordance to signals
received at axon terminals, a process reminiscent of back-propagation
algorithm for learning in neural networks.

By infusing antisense oligodeoxynucleotides into the hippocampus of
rats, Lee et al. (2004) showed that consolidation and reconsolidation
are doubly dissociable component processes of memory. Consolidation
involves BDNF but not the transcription factor ZIF268 (EGR1; 128990),
whereas reconsolidation recruits ZIF268 but not BDNF. Lee et al. (2004)
concluded that their findings confirmed a requirement for BDNF
specifically in memory consolidation and also resolved the role of
ZIF268 in brain plasticity, learning, and memory.

Neurotrophins (NTFs) act as survival and differentiation factors in the
nervous system and have been detected in the developing rodent testis.
To determine whether neurotrophins could influence development and
maturation of the human fetal testis, Robinson et al. (2003) examined
the cell-specific expression and distribution of several members of the
neurotrophin family and their receptors during the second trimester,
with particular emphasis on NT4 and TRKB. They detected expression of
mRNA for nerve growth factor (NGF; 162030), NTF3 (162660) and NTF4
(162662), BDNF, the high-affinity receptors TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC
(191316), and the low-affinity p75 receptor (NGFR) in the human testis
between 14 and 19 weeks' gestation. NT4 mRNA and protein were
predominantly localized to the peritubular cells. These cells were also
the site of expression of p75. By contrast, NGF and NT3 were mainly
expressed in Sertoli and interstitial cells. The authors concluded that
these data demonstrate the expression of neurotrophins and their
receptors in the human fetal testis during the second trimester and
indicate possible roles in the regulation of proliferation and survival
of germ cells and peritubular cells.

Pang et al. (2004) showed that tissue plasminogen activator (173370), by
activating the extracellular protease plasmin, converts the precursor
proBdnf to the mature Bdnf, and that such conversion is critical for
late-phase long-term potentiation expression in mouse hippocampus.
Moreover, Pang et al. (2004) found that application of mature Bdnf is
sufficient to rescue late-phase long-term potentiation when protein
synthesis is inhibited, which suggests that mature BDNF is a key protein
synthesis product for late-phase long-term potentiation expression.

By DNA microarray analysis, Kawamura et al. (2005) found Bdnf expression
induced by luteinizing hormone (see LH; 152780) during the preovulatory
period in mouse oocytes. Bdnf transcript and protein were detected in
mural granulosa and cumulus cells of preovulatory follicles. Ovarian
Bdnf acted on Trkb (NTRK2; 600456) receptors expressed exclusively in
oocytes to enhance first polar body extrusion of oocytes and to promote
the in vitro development of zygotes into preimplantation embryos.
Kawamura et al. (2005) concluded that ovarian BDNF is important to
nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation of oocytes.

Li et al. (2005) reported that in cultured cerebellar granule cells,
TRPC (transient receptor potential canonical) channels contribute to the
BDNF-induced elevation of calcium at the growth cone and are required
for BDNF-induced chemoattractive turning. They observed that several
members of the TRPC family are highly expressed in these neurons, and
both calcium ion elevation and growth cone turning induced by BDNF were
abolished by pharmacologic inhibition of TRPC channels, overexpression
of a dominant-negative form of TRPC3 (602345) or TRPC6 (603652), or
downregulation of TRPC3 expression via short interfering RNA (siRNA).
Thus, TRPC channel activity is essential for nerve-growth-cone guidance
by BDNF.

Wang and Poo (2005) reported that TRP-like channel activity exists in
the growth cones of cultured Xenopus neurons and can be modulated by
exposure to netrin-1 (601614) and BDNF, 2 chemoattractants for axon
guidance. Whole-cell recording from growth cones showed that netrin-1
induced a membrane depolarization, part of which remained after all
major voltage-dependent channels were blocked. Furthermore, the membrane
depolarization was sensitive to blockers of TRP channels. Pharmacologic
blockade of putative TRP currents or downregulation of Xenopus TRP1
(xTRPC1) expression with a specific morpholino oligonucleotide abolished
the growth cone turning and calcium ion elevation induced by a netrin-1
gradient. Thus, Wang and Poo (2005) concluded that TRPC currents reflect
early events in the growth cone's detection of some extracellular
guidance signal, resulting in membrane depolarization and cytoplasmic
calcium ion elevation that mediates the turning of growth cones.

Coull et al. (2005) showed that ATP-stimulated microglia cause a
depolarizating shift in the anion reversal potential in spinal lamina I
neurons. This shift inverts the polarity of currents activated by GABA,
as occurs after peripheral nerve injury. Applied BDNF mimicked the
alteration in the anion reversal potential. Blocking signaling between
BDNF and the receptor TrkB reversed the allodynia and the anion reversal
potential shift that follows both nerve injury and administration of
ATP-stimulated microglia. ATP stimulation evoked the release of BDNF
from microglia. Preventing BDNF release from microglia by pretreating
them with interfering RNA directed against BDNF before ATP stimulation
also inhibited the effects of these cells on the withdrawal threshold
and anion reversal potential. Coull et al. (2005) concluded that their
results showed that ATP-stimulated microglia signal to lamina I neurons,
causing a collapse of their transmembrane anion gradient, and that BDNF
is a crucial signaling molecule between microglia and neurons.

Using a PCR-based assay, Pruunsild et al. (2007) showed that BDNF and
BDNFOS transcripts formed double-stranded RNA duplexes in human
cerebellum in vivo.

In rat brain splices, the repetitive pairing of postsynaptic spikes and
2-photon uncaging of glutamate at single spines (a spike-timing
protocol) produced both immediate and gradual phases of spine
enlargement in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The gradual enlargement was
strongly dependent on protein synthesis and BDNF action, often
associated with spine twitching, and was induced specifically at the
spines that were immediately enlarged by the synaptic stimulation. Thus,
Tanaka et al. (2008) found that this spike-timing protocol is an
efficient trigger for BDNF secretion and induces protein
synthesis-dependent long-term enlargement at the level of single spines.

Deppmann et al. (2008) reported that developmental competition between
sympathetic neurons for survival is critically dependent on a
sensitization process initiated by target innervation and mediated by a
series of feedback loops. Target-derived nerve growth factor (NGF;
162020) promoted expression of its own receptor TrkA (191315) in mouse
and rat neurons and prolonged TrkA-mediated signals. NGF also controlled
expression of BDNF and neurotrophin-4 (162662), which, through the
receptor p75 (162010), can kill neighboring neurons with low retrograde
NGF-TrkA signaling, whereas neurons with high NGF-TrkA signaling are
protected. Perturbation of any of these feedback loops disrupts the
dynamics of competition. Deppmann et al. (2008) suggested that 3
target-initiated events are essential for rapid and robust competition
between neurons: sensitization, paracrine apoptotic signaling, and
protection from such effects.

Nott et al. (2008) demonstrated that BDNF triggers nitric oxide (NO)
synthesis and S-nitrosylation of histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2; 605164)
in neurons, resulting in changes to histone modifications and gene
activation. S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 occurs at cys262 and cys274 and
does not affect deacetylase activity. In contrast, nitrosylation of
HDAC2 induces its release from chromatin, which increases acetylation of
histones surrounding neurotrophin-dependent gene promoters and promotes
transcription. Notably, nitrosylation of HDAC2 in embryonic cortical
neurons regulates dendritic growth and branching, possibly by the
activation of CREB (123810)-dependent genes. Thus Nott et al. (2008)
concluded that, by stimulating NO production and S-nitrosylation of
HDAC2, neurotrophic factors promote chromatin remodeling and the
activation of genes that are associated with neuronal development.

By examining a mouse mutant in which the Bdnf long 3-prime UTR was
truncated, An et al. (2008) found that the Bdnf long 3-prime UTR had
roles in targeting of Bdnf mRNA to dendrites, controlling the abundance
of dendritic Bdnf protein, and regulating pruning and enlargement of
dendritic spines. CA1 pyramidal neurons lacking dendritic Bdnf mRNA
showed selective impairment in long-term potentiation at dendritic
synapses, but not at somatic synapses. An et al. (2008) concluded that
the long 3-prime UTR in BDNF mRNA has a role in trafficking and
dendritic functioning in central nervous system neurons.

Vargas-Perez et al. (2009) found that a single infusion of BDNF into the
ventral tegmental area promoted a shift from a dopamine-independent to a
dopamine-dependent opiate reward system, identical to that seen when an
opiate-naive rat becomes dependent and withdrawn. The shift involved a
switch in the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors of ventral
tegmental area GABAergic neurons, from inhibitory to excitatory
signaling.

BDNF is a key mediator of synaptic plasticity in multiple brain areas.
In rats subjected to auditory fear conditioning, Peters et al. (2010)
found that BDNF infused into the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex
reduced conditioned fear for up to 48 hours, even in the absence of
extinction training, which suggested that BDNF substituted for
extinction. Similar to extinction, BDNF-induced reduction in fear
required NMDA receptors and did not erase the original fear memory. Rats
failing to learn extinction showed reduced BDNF in hippocampal inputs to
the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex, and augmenting BDNF in this
pathway prevented extinction failure. Hence, Peters et al. (2010)
concluded that boosting BDNF activity in hippocampal-infralimbic
circuits may ameliorate disorders of learned fear.

Lobo et al. (2010) showed that deletion of TrkB (600456), the BDNF
receptor, selectively from D1+ or D2+ neurons in the nucleus accumbens
oppositely affects cocaine reward. Because loss of TrkB in D2+ neurons
increases their neuronal excitability, Lobo et al. (2010) next used
optogenetic tools to control selectively the firing rate of D1+ and D2+
nucleus accumbens neurons and studied consequent effects on cocaine
reward. Activation of D2+ neurons, mimicking the loss of TrkB,
suppressed cocaine reward, with opposite effects induced by activation
of D1+ neurons.

Autry et al. (2011) showed that ketamine and other NMDAR (see 138252)
antagonists produce fast-acting behavioral antidepressant-like effects
in mouse models, and that these effects depend on the rapid synthesis of
BDNF. They found that the ketamine-mediated blockade of NMDAR at rest
deactivates eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (EEF2K; 606968),
resulting in reduced EEF2 phosphorylation and desuppression of
translation of BDNF. Furthermore, Autry et al. (2011) found that
inhibitors of EEF2K induce fast-acting behavioral antidepressant-like
effects. Autry et al. (2011) concluded that the regulation of protein
synthesis by spontaneous neurotransmission may serve as a viable
therapeutic target for the development of fast-acting antidepressants.

Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that posttranscriptionally
downregulate expression of target mRNAs by inhibiting their translation
or causing their degradation. By in silico analysis, Mellios et al.
(2008) identified putative binding sites for 26 miRNAs, including MIR30A
(612329) and MIR195 (610718), in the 3-prime UTR of the BDNF transcript.
MIR30A, MIR195, and several other miRNAs predicted to interact with BDNF
were expressed in a laminar pattern in prefrontal cortex of adult
postmortem brain. The most abundant MIR30A miRNA, MIR30A-5p, originates
from the 5-prime end of the precursor MIR30A stem-loop structure.
Reporter gene assays showed that MIR30A-5p and MIR195 downregulated
expression of a reporter containing the BDNF 3-prime UTR. Quantitative
RT-PCR confirmed downregulation of BDNF mRNA by MIR30A-5p and MIR195.

Koo et al. (2012) discovered a surprising role for BDNF in countering
responses to chronic morphine exposure. The suppression of BDNF in the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) enhanced the ability of morphine to
increase dopamine neuron excitability and promote reward. In contrast,
optical stimulation of VTA dopamine terminals in nucleus accumbens
completely reversed the suppressive effect of BDNF on morphine reward.
Furthermore, Koo et al. (2012) identified numerous genes in the nucleus
accumbens, a major target region of VTA dopamine neurons, whose
regulation by BDNF in the context of chronic morphine exposure mediated
this counteractive function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome

Weese-Mayer et al. (2002) studied 19 children with congenital central
hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS; 209880), 5 of whom also had Hirschsprung
disease, for mutations in the BDNF gene. They identified a missense
mutation (113505.0001) in 1 child with isolated CCHS as well as in his
father, who did not have CCHS but had symptoms of postural hypotension
and vasovagal syncope.

- Susceptibility to Memory Impairment

Egan et al. (2003) examined the effects of a single nucleotide
polymorphism (dbSNP rs6265), G to A at nucleotide 196, that results in a
val66-to-met (V66M; 11350.0002) change in the 5-prime pro-region of the
human BDNF protein in a cohort of 641 human subjects. In humans, the M66
allele was associated with poorer episodic memory, abnormal hippocampal
activation assayed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
and lower hippocampal N-acetyl aspartate, assayed with MRI spectroscopy.
Neurons transfected with M66-BDNF-GFP showed lower
depolarization-induced secretion, while constitutive secretion was
unchanged. Furthermore, M66-BDNF-GFP failed to localize to secretory
granules or synapses. These results demonstrated a role for BDNF and its
V66M polymorphism in human memory and hippocampal function and suggested
that V66M exerts these effects by impacting intracellular trafficking
and activity-dependent secretion of BDNF.

- Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; 164230) experience
intrusive, disturbing, repetitive thoughts (obsessions) and the
uncontrollable urge to repeatedly enact stereotypic behaviors or rituals
(compulsions), thereby reducing the psychic anxiety produced by the
obsessional process. Hall et al. (2003) evaluated a possible association
between the BDNF gene and susceptibility to OCD by genotyping a number
of SNPs and 1 microsatellite marker from the extended BDNF locus in 164
OCD proband-parent trios. Extensive background linkage disequilibrium
was observed at this locus. Single-locus transmission distortion tests
revealed significant evidence of association with the disease for all
the BDNF gene markers tested, including the V66M polymorphism, which
affects the sequence of the BDNF protein. Analysis of multi-SNP
haplotypes provided similar results. Haplotype transmission comparisons
in this and previous studies pointed to a functionally distinct BDNF
haplotype uniquely marked by the rare M66 allele, which is
undertransmitted and likely confers a protective effect in OCD and other
psychiatric disorders.

- Anorexia Nervosa or Bulimia

Several genes with an essential role in the regulation of eating
behavior and body weight are considered candidates involved in the
etiology of the eating disorders anorexia nervosa (see 606788) and
bulimia nervosa (see 607499). BDNF has been implicated in the regulation
of food intake and body weight in rodents (Lyons et al., 1999; Kernie et
al., 2000; Rios et al., 2001). Ribases et al. (2003) reported a strong
association of the BDNF met66 allele (113505.0002) with restricting
anorexia nervosa (see 610269) and low minimum body mass index in Spanish
patients. In a case-control study of European patients with eating
disorders, Ribases et al. (2004) found that the met66 variant of BDNF
was strongly associated with all eating disorder subtypes and that the
-270C BDNF variant (113505.0003) had an effect on bulimia nervosa
(610269) and late age at onset of weight loss.

- Bipolar Disorder

Geller et al. (2004) noted that 2 independent research groups (Sklar et
al., 2002; Neves-Pereira et al., 2002), using family-based methods, had
found that the val66 allele of BDNF was preferentially transmitted to
predominantly Caucasian adult probands with bipolar disorder (125480).
To determine whether preferential transmission of the val66 allele also
occurred in prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder I, Geller
et al. (2004) studied 53 complete, independent trios in which the mean
age of the probands was 10.7 years. Using the Family Based Association
Test in 27 informative families, Geller et al. (2004) found that the
BDNF val66 allele was preferentially transmitted (p = 0.014). Lohoff et
al. (2005) studied the BDNF val66 allele in 621 European patients with
bipolar I disorder and positive family histories of affective disorder
and 998 European controls. The frequency of the val66 allele was
significantly increased in the bipolar I patients when compared to
controls (p = 0.028; OR of 1.22).

- Schizophrenia

Neves-Pereira et al. (2005) studied the BDNF gene as a risk factor for
schizophrenia (181500) in a Scottish population, including 321 probands
with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder,
263 probands with a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, and 350
controls. The val66-to-met polymorphism showed significant (p = 0.005)
association for valine (allele G) with schizophrenia but not bipolar
disorder. Haplotype analysis of the val/met SNP and a dinucleotide
repeat polymorphism in the promoter region revealed highly significant
(p less than 0.00000001) underrepresentation of the methionine (met1)
haplotype in the schizophrenic but not the bipolar population.
Therefore, the risk of this polymorphism may depend upon haplotypic
background on which the val/met variant is carried.

- Wilms Tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary Anomalies, Mental Retardation
and Obesity Syndrome (WAGRO)

In a study of the relationship between genotype and body mass index
(BMI) in 33 patients with the chromosome 11p13 deletion syndrome (WAGR;
194072), Han et al. (2008) found that haploinsufficiency for BDNF was
strongly associated the WAGR subtype characterized by childhood-onset
obesity (WAGRO; 612469). All 19 patients with deletions that involved
any portion of the BDNF gene became obese by 10 years of age, whereas in
each patient who had normal weight during childhood, the BDNF gene was
intact. The concentration of serum BDNF in the group of patients with
heterozygous BDNF deletions was 47% lower than that in patients without
BDNF deletions.

ANIMAL MODEL

Conover et al. (1995) and Liu et al. (1995) performed studies in mice
rendered deficient in Bdnf and/or neurotrophin-4 (Nt4; 162662) by the
use of homologous recombination targeting vectors in embryonic stem
cells. Conover et al. (1995) found that Nt4-deficient mice were
long-lived and showed no obvious neurologic defects. Further analysis of
distinct neuronal populations demonstrated that vestibular and
trigeminal sensory neurons required Bdnf but not Nt4, whereas
nodose-petrosal sensory neurons required both Bdnf and Nt4. Liu et al.
(1995) likewise found that Nt4-deficient mice were viable but exhibited
a loss of sensory neurons in the nodose-petrosal and geniculate ganglia.
In contrast, motor neurons of the facial nucleus and sympathetic neurons
of the superior cervical ganglion were unaffected. In mice lacking both
Nt4 and Bdnf, facial motor neurons remained unaffected, whereas the loss
of sensory neurons was more severe than with either mutation alone.

Maturation of the visual cortex is influenced by visual experience
during an early postnatal period. Huang et al. (1999) examined the
maturation and plasticity of the visual cortex in transgenic mice in
which the postnatal rise of Bdnf was accelerated using the promoter of
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-alpha (CAMK2A; 114078)
upstream of the mouse Bdnf gene. In these mice, the maturation of
GABAergic innervation and inhibition was accelerated. Furthermore, the
age-dependent decline of cortical long-term potentiation induced by
white matter stimulation, a form of synaptic plasticity sensitive to
cortical inhibition, occurred earlier. The transgenic mice also showed a
precocious development of visual acuity and an earlier termination of
the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. The authors
proposed that BDNF promotes the maturation of cortical inhibition during
early postnatal life, thereby regulating the critical period for visual
cortical plasticity.

BDNF was initially thought to be responsible for neuron proliferation,
differentiation, and survival through its uptake at nerve terminals and
retrograde transport to the cell body. A more diverse role for BDNF
emerged progressively from observations showing that it is also
transported anterogradely, is released upon neuron depolarization, and
triggers rapid intracellular signals and action potentials in central
neurons. Guillin et al. (2001) reported that BDNF elicits long-term
neuronal adaptations by controlling the responsiveness of its target
neurons to the important neurotransmitter, dopamine. Using lesions and
gene-targeted mice lacking BDNF, Guillin et al. (2001) showed that BDNF
from dopamine neurons is responsible for inducing normal expression of
the dopamine D3 receptor (126451) in nucleus accumbens both during
development and in adulthood. BDNF from corticostriatal neurons also
induces behavioral sensitization by triggering overexpression of the D3
receptor in striatum of hemiparkinsonian rats. Guillin et al. (2001)
concluded that BDNF may be an important determinant of pathophysiologic
conditions such as drug addiction, schizophrenia (181500), or Parkinson
disease (PD; 168600), in which D3 receptor expression is abnormal.

Lyons et al. (1999) showed that heterozygous Bdnf +/- mice demonstrated
physiologic disturbances in central serotonergic neurons in early
adulthood as well as a structural deterioration of these neurons in
advanced age. Abnormalities included blunted neuronal serotonin release
responses and altered expression of several postsynaptic serotonin
receptors in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. The
heterozygous mice also showed behavioral abnormalities that had been
linked to serotonergic dysfunction, including increased aggressiveness
and hyperphagia. The authors concluded that endogenous BDNF is critical
for the normal development and function of central serotonergic neurons.

The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R; 155541) has a critical role in
regulating energy balance, and mutations in the MC4R gene result in
obesity in mice and humans. Xu et al. (2003) found that similar to MC4R
mutants, mouse mutants that express decreased amounts of the BDNF
receptor TrkB (600456) showed hyperphagia and maturity-onset obesity,
suggesting a role for BDNF in energy balance. The authors found that
BDNF is an anorexigenic factor that is highly expressed in murine
ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) nuclei and is regulated by feeding
status. Deficiency in MC4R signaling reduced expression of BDNF in the
VMH, indicating that BDNF and its receptor TrkB are downstream
components in the MC4R-mediated control of energy balance.

Mice experiencing repeated aggression develop a long-lasting aversion to
social contact, which can be normalized by chronic, but not acute,
administration of antidepressants. Using viral-mediated, mesolimbic
dopamine pathway-specific knockdown of BDNF, Berton et al. (2006) showed
that BDNF is required for the development of this experience-dependent
social aversion. Gene profiling in the nucleus accumbens indicated that
local knockdown of BDNF obliterates most of the effects of repeated
aggression on gene expression within this circuit, with similar effects
being produced by chronic treatment with antidepressant. Berton et al.
(2006) concluded that their results establish an essential role for BDNF
in mediating long-term neural and behavioral plasticity in response to
aversive social experiences.

Kalueff et al. (2006) questioned the report of Berton et al. (2006) on
several points, suggesting that modeling transitions from anxiety to
depression, use of longer social and nonsocial stressors, and specific
targeting of neuromediatory systems beyond dopamine may help further
elaborate BDNF's important role in brain stress-related disorders. In
response, Berton et al. (2006) agreed with Kalueff et al. (2006) that
the duration of the chronic social defeat, which was not addressed in
their earlier studies, is a critical dimension for future
investigations. They further noted that the persistent social avoidance
induced by chronic social defeat stress could be relevant to several
human syndromes including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress
disorder. They remarked that it should not be surprising that a molecule
like BDNF exerts different or even opposite effects on behavior
depending on the neural circuitry in question.

Govindarajan et al. (2006) observed that transgenic mice overexpressing
Bdnf showed increased anxiety behavior paralleled by an increase in
dendritic spine density in the basolateral amygdala, similar to the
effects of chronic stress on control mice. In contrast, mice
overexpressing Bdnf showed decreased depressive behavior and absence of
stress-induced hippocampal atrophy, thus showing an antidepressive
effect. The findings indicated inherent differences between the amygdala
and hippocampus in manifesting diverse emotional symptoms related to
mood disorders.

Chen et al. (2006) generated a variant Bdnf mouse carrying a
substitution of a variant methionine for valine at codon 66 (V66M;
113505.0002) on both alleles. This mouse reproduced the phenotypic
hallmarks of human with the variant allele. Bdnf(met) was expressed in
brain at normal levels, but its secretion from neurons was defective.
When placed in stressful settings, Bdnf(met/met) mice exhibited
increased anxiety-related behaviors that were not normalized by the
antidepressant fluoxetine. Chen et al. (2006) concluded that a variant
BDNF may thus play a key role in genetic predispositions to anxiety and
depressive disorders.

Bekinschtein et al. (2008) found that intrahippocampal delivery of BDNF
in rats reversed the deficit in memory persistence caused by
pharmacologic inhibition of hippocampal protein synthesis. BDNF also
induced memory persistence by itself in an ERK (see 176948)-dependent
manner. The authors concluded that BDNF is both necessary and sufficient
to induce a late postacquisition phase in the hippocampus that is
essential for long-term memory storage.

Nagahara et al. (2009) reported beneficial effects of entorhinal BDNF
administration in 3 models of Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300)-related
cognitive decline in mouse and nonhuman primates: an App (104760)-mutant
mouse strain, aged rats, and aged monkeys. BDNF is widely expressed in
the entorhinal cortex and undergoes anterograde transport into the
hippocampus, where it is implicated in plasticity mechanisms. In
App-transgenic mice, lentiviral BDNF gene delivery administered after
disease onset reversed synapse loss, partially normalized aberrant gene
expression, improved cell signaling, and restored learning and memory.
These changes occurred independently of amyloid plaque load. In aged
rats, BDNF protein and lentiviral gene infusion, respectively, reversed
cognitive decline and improved age-related perturbations in gene
expression. In adult rats and primates, lentiviral BDNF gene delivery
prevented lesion-induced death of entorhinal cortical neurons. Finally,
lentiviral BDNF gene delivery and expression in aged primates reversed
neuronal atrophy and ameliorated age-related cognitive impairment.
Nagahara et al. (2009) suggested that BDNF exerts substantial protective
effects on crucial neuronal circuitry involved in AD, acting through
amyloid-independent mechanisms.

In rats with induced status epilepticus and hippocampal damage, Paradiso
et al. (2009) found that injection of FGF2 (134920) and BDNF-containing
vectors into the lesioned hippocampus resulted in increased
neuronogenesis with appropriate distribution, less neuronal damage,
decreased epileptogenesis, and decreased occurrence and severity of
spontaneous recurrent seizures 2 to 3 weeks later. The findings
indicated that supplementation of specific growth factors in lesioned
areas of the brain may decrease neuronal damage and lessen
epileptogenesis.

Weese-Mayer et al. (2002) studied 19 children with congenital central

disease, for mutations in the BDNF gene. A mutation was identified in
one child with isolated CCHS and his father, who did not have CCHS but
had symptoms of postural hypotension and vasovagal syncope. The authors
stated that the mutation resulted in the substitution of an isoleucine
for threonine at amino acid position 2 in the coding sequence.

BDNF, VAL66MET

Egan et al. (2003) identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (dbSNP
6265), 196G-A, in the BDNF gene that results in a val66-to-met (V66M)
change in the 5-prime pro-region of the protein. They examined the
effects of this polymorphism in a cohort of 641 human subjects. The M66
allele was associated with poorer episodic memory, abnormal hippocampal
activation assayed with fMRI, and lower hippocampal N-acetyl aspartate
assayed with MRI spectroscopy.

In a study of 164 proband-parent trios with obsessive-compulsive
disorder (164230), Hall et al. (2003) found significant evidence of
association between OCD and all BDNF gene markers tested, including the
V66M polymorphism. Haplotype transmission comparisons in this and
previous studies pointed to a functionally distinct BDNF haplotype
uniquely marked by the rare M66 allele, which is undertransmitted and
likely confers a protective effect in OCD and other psychiatric
disorders.

Ribases et al. (2003) reported a strong association of the met66 allele
with restricting anorexia nervosa (ANR; see 610269) and low minimum body
mass index in Spanish patients. Ribases et al. (2004) performed a
case-control study in 1,142 European patients with eating disorders.
They found that the met66 variant of BDNF was strongly associated with
all eating disorder subtypes (anorexia nervosa, restricting anorexia
nervosa, binge-eating/purging anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa; see
610269).

Geller et al. (2004) noted that Sklar et al. (2002) and Neves-Pereira et
al. (2002), using family-based methods, had found that the val66 allele
was preferentially transmitted to predominantly Caucasian adult probands
with bipolar disorder (125480). Geller et al. (2004) reported that the
val66 allele was also preferentially transmitted in children with
bipolar disorder.

Lohoff et al. (2005) studied the BDNF val66 allele in 621 European
patients with bipolar I disorder and positive family histories of
affective disorder and 998 European controls. The frequency of the val66
allele was significantly increased in the bipolar I patients when
compared to controls (p = 0.028; OR of 1.22).

Rybakowski et al. (2006) studied the performance of 111 patients with
bipolar disorder, 129 schizophrenia patients, and 92 healthy controls on
the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test in the context of the BDNF V66M
polymorphism. Bipolar patients with the val/val genotype made
significantly fewer perseverative errors and had more correctly
completed categories and conceptual level responses compared to bipolar
patients with the val/met or met/met genotypes. No differences were
observed in schizophrenia patients or controls.

Rosa et al. (2006) studied the V66M polymorphism in a sample of 94
nuclear families (94 probands with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and
282 family members). The results indicated that the val66 polymorphism
plays a significant role in the phenotype of psychosis. No association
was found with prefrontal cognitive functions as assessed on the
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Trail Making Test.

In a metaanalysis of 6 published association studies, Zintzaras and
Hadjigeorgiou (2005) found no association between the 196G-A
polymorphism and the development of Parkinson disease.

In a study of 597 patients from 322 families with PD, Karamohamed et al.
(2005) found that homozygosity for the met66 allele was associated with
a 5.4-year older age at disease onset. The findings were significant
only under an autosomal recessive model (see, e.g., PARK2; 600116).

Soliman et al. (2010) identified parallel phenotypes in mice and humans
resulting from the common V66M SNP in BDNF, which is involved in
anxiety-related behavior. An inbred genetic knockin mouse strain
expressing the variant BDNF recapitulated the phenotypic effects of the
human polymorphism. Both were impaired in extinguishing a conditioned
fear response, which was paralleled by atypical frontoamygdala activity
in humans. Soliman et al. (2010) concluded that this variant BDNF allele
may play a role in anxiety disorders showing impaired learning of cues
that signal safety versus threat and in the efficacy of treatments that
rely on extinction mechanisms, such as exposure therapy.

BULIMIA NERVOSA, AGE OF ONSET OF WEIGHT LOSS IN
BDNF, -270C-T

Among 268 European patients with bulimia nervosa (610269), Ribases et
al. (2004) found an effect of a promoter polymorphism in BDNF, -270C-T,
on age of onset of weight loss. Patients with the C/C genotype had a
later mean age of onset of weight loss (18.1 years vs 15.9 years; p =
0.001) compared to those with the C/T or T/T genotype.

606605	TITLE *606605 ATR-INTERACTING PROTEIN; ATRIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cortez et al. (2001) searched for substrates of ATM (see 607585) and ATR
(601215) and identified a protein of 86 kD, which they called ATRIP for
'ATR-interacting protein.' The full-length cDNA encodes a deduced
791-amino acid protein with a coiled-coil domain near its N terminus.
RNA blotting indicated that ATRIP is expressed in all tissues tested.
Cortez et al. (2001) also identified an alternatively spliced exon
encoding amino acids 658 to 684 near the C-terminus. RT-PCR from 2 cell
lines indicated that both forms were expressed.

GENE FUNCTION

ATRIP is phosphorylated by ATR, regulates ATR expression, and is an
essential component of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. Cortez et al.
(2001) demonstrated that ATR and ATRIP both localize to intranuclear
foci after DNA damage or inhibition of replication. Deletion of ATR
mediated by the Cre recombinase caused the loss of ATR and ATRIP
expression, loss of DNA damage checkpoint responses, and cell death.
Therefore, ATR is essential for the viability of human somatic cells.
Small interfering RNA directed against ATRIP caused the loss of both
ATRIP and ATR expression and the loss of checkpoint responses to DNA
damage. Cortez et al. (2001) concluded that ATRIP and ATR are mutually
dependent partners in cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways.

The function of the ATR-ATRIP protein kinase complex is crucial for the
cellular response to replication stress and DNA damage. Zou and Elledge
(2003) demonstrated that replication protein A (RPA) complex, which
associates with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), is required for recruitment
of ATR to sites of DNA damage and for ATR-mediated CHK1 (603078)
activation in human cells. In vitro, RPA stimulates the binding of ATRIP
to single-stranded DNA. The binding of ATRIP to RPA-coated
single-stranded DNA enables the ATR-ATRIP complex to associate with DNA
and stimulates phosphorylation of the RAD17 (603139) protein that is
bound to DNA. Furthermore, Ddc2, the budding yeast homolog of ATRIP, is
specifically recruited to double-stranded DNA breaks in an RPA-dependent
manner. A checkpoint-deficient mutant of RPA, rfa1-t11, is defective for
recruiting Ddc2 to single-stranded DNA both in vivo and in vitro. Zou
and Elledge (2003) concluded that RPA-coated single-stranded DNA is the
critical structure at sites of DNA damage that recruits the ATR-ATRIP
complex and facilitates its recognition of substrates for
phosphorylation and the initiation of checkpoint signaling.

By mutation analysis, Namiki and Zou (2006) identified 2 major
RPA-ssDNA-interacting domains of ATRIP in regions flanking the conserved
coiled-coil domain. They also identified an internal region of ATRIP
that exhibited affinity to single-stranded DNA. Namiki and Zou (2006)
concluded that there are multiple interactions between ATRIP and
RPA-ssDNA and that ATRIP may interact directly with ssDNA in the
ATRIP-RPA-ssDNA complex.

603420	TITLE *603420 CALUMENIN; CALU
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Many calcium-binding proteins are reported to be localized in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in such ER functions as protein
folding and sorting. Among these are RCN1 (602735), RCN2 (602584), and
calumenin (CALU), which form a novel family of calcium-binding proteins
in the ER and Golgi apparatus. By searching sequence databases with a
mouse Calu cDNA sequence (Yabe et al., 1997), Yabe et al. (1998)
identified a human CALU EST, which they used to clone a full-length CALU
cDNA. The cDNA encodes a deduced 315-amino acid protein containing 6
EF-hand motifs, 1 potential N-glycosylation site, and a C-terminal ER
retention signal. The human and mouse CALU proteins are 98% identical.
Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the 3.4-kb CALU mRNA is
ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Southern blot analysis using a
human CALU cDNA probe detected bands in a variety of species.

MAPPING

Yabe et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Calu gene to the proximal portion of
chromosome 7. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Yabe et al. (1998)
localized the human CALU gene to 7q32, which was an unexpected result
due to the homology of synteny between proximal mouse chromosome 7 and
human 19q13.2-q13.3.

;;CHYMASE, MAST CELL;;
CHYMASE, HEART; CYH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chymase is a major secreted protease of mast cells with suspected roles
in vasoactive peptide generation, extracellular matrix degradation, and
regulation of gland secretion. Caughey et al. (1991) cloned and
sequenced a human chymase gene encoding a preproenzyme with a 19-amino
acid signal peptide, an acidic 2-amino acid propeptide, and a 226-amino
acid catalytic domain. In the phase and placement of introns, the
organization of the human chymase gene is similar to that of several
other granule-associated leukocyte serine proteases including lymphocyte
granzymes (see 600311), neutrophil cathepsin G (CTSG; 116830), and
elastase (130130). However, its organization differs from that of mast
cell tryptase.

GENE FUNCTION

The heart, a target organ for angiotensin II (see 106150), has a dual
pathway for its formation in which the major angiotensin II-forming
enzymes are angiotensin I-converting enzyme (106180) and chymase.
Compared to other chymases, human heart chymase has an unusually high
degree of specificity for the substrate angiotensin I. Urata et al.
(1991) cloned the gene for human heart chymase, the most catalytically
efficient enzyme that had been described for the cleavage of angiotensin
I to yield angiotensin II and the dipeptide his-leu. The deduced amino
acid sequence showed a high degree of homology to other members of the
chymase subfamily. However, this gene lacked mast cell-specific
sequences found in the 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions of the
rat chymase II gene. In addition, human heart chymase contained clusters
of unique amino acid sequences located at key positions probably
involved in substrate binding. Urata et al. (1993) performed in situ
hybridization studies suggesting that cardiac mast cells, mesenchymal
interstitial cells, and endothelial cells are the cellular sites of
synthesis of angiotensin II and storage of chymase.

Ju et al. (2001) cloned a rat vascular chymase (RVCH) from smooth muscle
cells (SMCs) that converts angiotensin I to II and is upregulated in SMC
from spontaneously hypertensive versus normotensive rats. To determine
whether increased activity of RVCH is sufficient to cause hypertension,
transgenic mice were generated with targeted conditional expression of
RVCH to SMC. Ju et al. (2001) confirmed conditional expression of RVCH
in the absence, but not in the presence, of dietary doxycycline.
Systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures were elevated in the transgenic
mice. Hypertension was completely reversed by doxycycline, suggesting a
causal link with chymase expression. Medial thickening of mesenteric
arteries in the transgenic mice was associated with increased SMC
proliferation. These structural changes were also prevented by
doxycycline. Increased vasoconstriction in response to phenylephrine and
impaired metacholine-induced vasodilatation could be demonstrated when
compared with littermate controls or with the doxycycline-treated group.
These studies suggested that upregulation of this vascular chymase is
sufficient to cause hypertensive arteriopathy, and that RVCH may be a
candidate gene and a therapeutic target in patients with high blood
pressure.

Using a mouse model of acute inflammation, Chmelar et al. (2011) found
that a salivary protein, termed Irs2, from the tick Ixodes ricinus, the
vector for Lyme disease in Europe, inhibited edema formation and
neutrophil influx in inflamed tissue. Using a panel of human proteins,
they found that Irs2 primarily inhibited CTSG and CMA1. Human platelet
aggregation assays showed that Irs2 inhibited CTSG-induced and thrombin
(F2; 176930)-induced platelet aggregation. Structural analysis revealed
that Irs2 resembles mammalian serpins, including bovine antithrombin III
(SERPINC1; 107300) and human alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (SERPINA3; 107280)
and alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1; 107400).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Sharma et al. (2005) studied the association of a polymorphism in the
CMA1 gene, -1903G-A, and a (TG)n(GA)n repeat polymorphism located 254 bp
downstream of the gene with asthma and IgE levels in Indian asthmatic
patients with a family history of asthma and atopy (see 147050). A
significant association was observed between -1903G-A genotype and serum
IgE levels (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0004 for a northern and western cohort,
respectively). Sharma et al. (2005) suggested that the CMA1 gene
contributes to asthma susceptibility and may be involved in regulating
IgE levels in atopic asthma.

MAPPING

By a study of hamster-human hybrid DNAs, Caughey et al. (1991) assigned
the CMA1 gene to human chromosome 14, which is the site of related
genes. From studies of YACs and cosmid clones, Caughey et al. (1993)
demonstrated that the mast cell chymase gene is located at 14q11.2 in
the same cluster as the genes for 3 other proteases, T-cell receptor
alpha/delta (TCRA; see 186880/TCRD; see 186810), neutrophil cathepsin G,
and the lymphocyte cathepsin G-like proteins CGL1 (123910) and CGL2
(116831). They found that CMA1 maps to a site within 150 kb of the
cathepsin G gene. The gene order is:
cen--TCRA/TCRD--CGL1--CGL2--CTSG--CMA. In some cells, the chymase and
cathepsin G genes were cotranscribed; in others, they appeared to be
capable of independent regulation.

601684	TITLE *601684 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S6 KINASE, 90-KD, 1; RPS6KA1
;;RIBOSOMAL S6 KINASE 1; RSK1;;
MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 1A; MAPKAPK1A;;
MAPKAP KINASE 1A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase) family comprises growth factor-regulated
serine/threonine kinases, known also as p90(rsk). Homologs of RSK exist
in several species. The highly conserved feature of all members of the
RSK family is the presence of 2 nonidentical kinase catalytic domains.
RSKs are implicated in the activation of the mitogen-activated kinase
(MAPK) cascade (see 176872) and the stimulation of cell proliferation
(at the transition between phases G0 and G1 of the cell cycle) and
differentiation.

CLONING

Moller et al. (1994) described the cloning and characterization of 3
genes encoding RSKs, which they called HU1 (RPS6KA1), HU2 (RPS6KA2;
601685), and HU3 (RPS6KA3; 300075). The HU1 cDNA (GenBank GENBANK
L07597) encodes a predicted 735-amino acid protein containing 2 distinct
consensus ATP-binding site sequences. Northern blot and RNase protection
analyses detected an approximately 3.5-kb HU1 transcript in lymphocytes,
skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue.

Zeniou et al. (2002) determined the expression of the RSK1, RSK2
(300075), and RSK3 (601685) genes in various human tissues, during mouse
embryogenesis, and in mouse brain. The 3 RSK mRNAs were expressed in all
human tissues and brain regions tested, supporting functional
redundancy. However, tissue-specific variations in levels suggested that
the proteins may also serve specific roles. The mouse Rsk3 gene was
prominently expressed in the developing neural and sensory tissues,
whereas Rsk1 gene expression was the strongest in various other tissues
with high proliferative activity, suggesting distinct roles during
development. In adult mouse brain, the highest levels of Rsk2 expression
were observed in regions with high synaptic activity, including the
neocortex, the hippocampus, and Purkinje cells. The authors suggested
that in these areas, which are essential to cognitive function and
learning, the RSK1 and RSK3 genes may not be able to fully compensate
for a lack of RSK2 function.

GENE FUNCTION

Bonni et al. (1999) characterized the mechanism by which the RAS (see
190020)-MAPK signaling pathway (see 602448) mediates growth
factor-dependent cell survival. The MAP-activated kinases, the Rsks,
catalyzed the phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD (603167)
at ser112 both in vitro and in vivo. The Rsk-induced phosphorylation of
BAD at ser112 suppressed BAD-mediated apoptosis in neurons. The Rsks are
known to phosphorylate the transcription factor CREB (see 123810) at
ser133. Activated CREB promoted cell survival, and inhibition of CREB
phosphorylation at ser133 triggered apoptosis. Bonni et al. (1999)
suggested that the MAP kinase signaling pathway promotes cell survival
by a dual mechanism comprising the posttranslational modification and
inactivation of a component of the cell death machinery and the
increased transcription of prosurvival genes.

Bhatt and Ferrell (1999) demonstrated that Xenopus laevis egg extracts
immunodepleted of Rsk lost their capacity to undergo mitotic arrest in
response to activation of the Mos (190060)-MEK1 (176872)-p42 (603441)
MAPK cascade of protein kinases. Replenishing Rsk-depleted extracts with
catalytically competent Rsk protein restored the ability of the extracts
to undergo mitotic arrest. Bhatt and Ferrell (1999) concluded that Rsk
appears to be essential for cytostatic factor arrest.

Gross et al. (1999) investigated whether cytostatic factor arrest is
mediated by the protein kinase p90 Rsk, which is phosphorylated and
activated by MAPK, by expressing a constitutively activated form of Rsk
in Xenopus embryos. Expression of constitutively active Rsk resulted in
cleavage arrest, and cytologic analysis showed that arrested blastomeres
were in M phase with prominent spindles characteristic of meiotic
metaphase. Thus, Gross et al. (1999) concluded that Rsk appears to be
the mediator of MAPK-dependent cytostatic factor arrest in vertebrate
unfertilized eggs. Gross et al. (1999) found that because Rsk expression
did not activate the endogenous MAPK pathway, MAPK required no other
substrate for induction of cytostatic factor arrest. They also stated
that cytostatic factor arrest is not a consequence of direct regulation
of the spindle assembly checkpoint or the anaphase-promoting complex by
MAPK.

Cohen et al. (2005) used a structural bioinformatics approach to
identify 2 selectivity filters, a threonine and a cysteine, at defined
positions in the active site of p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RSK). A
fluoromethylketone inhibitor, designed to exploit both selectivity
filters, potently and selectively inactivated RSK1 and RSK2 in mammalian
cells. Kinases with only one selectivity filter were resistant to the
inhibitor, yet they became sensitized after genetic introduction of the
second selectivity filter. Thus, Cohen et al. (2005) concluded that 2
amino acids that distinguish RSK from other protein kinases are
sufficient to confer inhibitor sensitivity.

Nishiyama et al. (2007) reported that in Xenopus eggs Erp1 (see 609110)
is a substrate of p90rsk, and that Mos (a mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase)-dependent phosphorylation of Erp1 by p90rsk
at thr336, ser342, and ser344 is crucial for both stabilizing Erp1 and
establishing cytostatic factor (CSF) arrest in meiosis II oocytes.
Semiquantitative analysis of CSF-arrested egg extracts revealed that the
Mos-dependent phosphorylation of Erp1 enhances, but does not generate,
the activity of Erp1 that maintains metaphase arrest. Nishiyama et al.
(2007) concluded that their results also suggested that Erp1 inhibits
cyclin B (see 123836) degradation by binding the anaphase-promoting
complex/cyclosome (APC/C) at its carboxy-terminal destruction box, and
this binding is also enhanced by the Mos-dependent phosphorylation.
Thus, Mos and Erp1 collaboratively establish and maintain metaphase II
arrest in Xenopus eggs.

Inoue et al. (2007) demonstrated that p90rsk, the kinase immediately
downstream from Mos-MAPK, directly targets Erp1 for CSF arrest in
Xenopus oocytes. Erp1 is synthesized immediately after meiosis I, and
the Mos-MAPK pathway or p90rsk is essential for CSF arrest by Erp1.
p90rsk can directly phosphorylate Erp1 on ser335/thr336 both in vivo and
in vitro, and upregulates both Erp1 stability and activity. Erp1 is also
present in early embryos, but has little CSF activity owing, at least in
part, to the absence of p90rsk activity. Inoue et al. (2007) concluded
that their results clarified the direct link of the classical Mos-MAPK
pathway to Erp1 in meiotic arrest of vertebrate oocytes.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Moller et al. (1994) mapped the
RPS6KA1 gene to chromosome 3.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nomura et al. (1994) identified ORFX as a non-linked copy of RING3
(BRD2; 601540), a gene in the human major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class II region on 6p21.3.

MAPPING

Using a PCR probe derived from the ORFX cDNA sequence, Thorpe et al.
(1996) mapped the gene, symbolized here RING3L, by fluorescence in situ
hybridization analysis to 9q34. Several other MHC-related genes have
been found to map to the same region.

GENE FUNCTION

Dawson et al. (2011) demonstrated that I-BET151, a novel small molecule
inhibitor of the BET family, of which BRD3 is a member, has profound
efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukemia cell lines through
the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151
treatment in 2 human leukemia cell lines with different MLL fusions
altered the expression of a common set of genes whose function may
account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is,
at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes
BCL2 (151430), C-MYC (190080), and CDK6 (603368) through the
displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc, and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo
studies indicated that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value,
providing survival benefit in 2 distinct mouse models of murine

610396	TITLE *610396 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A; TRAPPC6A
;;TRAPP COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRAPPC6A is a subunit of the TRAPPI and TRAPPII complexes (Gwynn et al.,
2006).

CLONING

Gwynn et al. (2006) cloned mouse Trappc6a, and they identified human
TRAPPC6A by database analysis. Mouse and human TRAPPC6A encode deduced
159-amino acid proteins that share 83% identity and have calculated
molecular masses of 17.4 kD. Both proteins contain 2 motifs conserved in
TRAPPC6B (610397) and several yeast TRAPP subunits, including Trs33, the
putative homolog of TRAPPC6A and TRAPPC6B. Northern blot analysis
detected Trappc6a expression in all mouse tissues examined, with highest
expression in kidney, liver, and testis. Expression of mouse Trappc6a
was higher in cultured melanocytes than in kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gwynn et al. (2006) determined that the mouse Trappc6a gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
TRAPPC6A gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH98840). Gwynn et al. (2006)
mapped the mouse Trappc6a gene to chromosome 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gwynn et al. (2006) identified a recessive mutation in mice, designated
'mosaic hypopigmentation' (Mhyp), that caused mosaic loss of coat
pigmentation and patchy loss of pigmentation with abnormal melanosomes
in the retinal pigmented epithelial layer of the eye. They determined
that Mhyp resulted from integration of an 8.4-kb retrovirus into intron
1 of the Trappc6a gene.

120105	TITLE *120105 COLIPASE, PANCREATIC; CLPS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pancreatic colipase is a 12-kD polypeptide cofactor for pancreatic
lipase (EC 3.1.1.3; 246600), an enzyme essential for the absorption of
dietary long-chain triglyceride fatty acids. Colipase is thought to
anchor lipase noncovalently to the surface of lipid micelles,
counteracting the destabilizing influence of intestinal bile salts
(summary by Davis et al., 1991).

CLONING

Using primers derived from the known amino acid sequence, Davis et al.
(1991) employed the PCR to produce a cDNA clone corresponding to the
complete coding region of the human procolipase mRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sims and Lowe (1992) found that the CLPS gene has 3 exons and that the
5-prime-flanking region contains a TATA box, a GC box, and a 28-bp
region with homology to the rat pancreatic-specific enhancer.

MAPPING

By the study of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids, Davis et al. (1991)
determined that the CLPS gene is located in the region 6pter-p21.1.

Sims and Lowe (1992) confirmed the assignment of the CLPS gene to
chromosome 6 by blots of hamster-human somatic cell hybrid DNA using the
entire colipase cDNA.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2006) reported a mechanism by which constant darkness
regulates the gene expression of fat catabolic enzymes in mice. Genes
for murine procolipase (Clps) and pancreatic lipase-related protein-2
(Plrp2; 604423) are activated in a circadian manner in peripheral organs
during 12-hour dark:12-hour dark (DD) but not light-dark (LD) cycles.
This mechanism is deregulated in circadian-deficient Per1/Per2 double
mutant mice. Zhang et al. (2006) identified circadian-regulated
5-prime-AMP, which is elevated in the blood of DD mice, as a key
mediator of this response. Synthetic 5-prime-AMP induced torpor (a
hibernation-like state) and murine Clps expression in LD mice. Torpor
induced by metabolic stress was associated with elevated 5-prime-AMP
levels in DD mice. Levels of glucose and nonesterified fatty acid in the
blood were reversed in DD and LD mice. Induction of murine Clps
expression by 5-prime-AMP in LD mice was reciprocally linked to blood
glucose levels. Zhang et al. (2006) concluded that their findings
uncovered a circadian metabolic rhythm in mammals.

603732	TITLE *603732 CRYPTOCHROME 2; CRY2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hsu et al. (1996) identified a human gene, CRY2, whose product had 73%
amino acid identity to the human (6-4)photolyase (CRY1; 601933). The
CRY2 protein shares 51% amino acid sequence identity to Drosophila
(6-4)photolyase. Hsu et al. (1996) purified the human CRY1 and CRY2
proteins and characterized them as maltose-binding fusion proteins that
contain FAD and a pterin cofactor. Both CRY1 and CRY2 proteins lacked
photolyase activity. Hsu et al. (1996) concluded that these proteins are
not photolyases, but may function as blue-light photoreceptors in
humans.

As part of a search for human brain cDNA clones with the potential to
encode large proteins in vitro, Ishikawa et al. (1998) independently
identified CRY2. The CRY2 open reading frame encodes a protein of 589
amino acids with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kD.

Kobayashi et al. (1998) isolated and characterized mouse Cry1 and Cry2.
While Cry1 is localized to the mitochondria, Cry2 is found mainly in the
nucleus. The C termini of both mouse Cry2 and human CRY2 each contain a
nuclear localization signal, and the N terminus of mouse Cry1 contains a
mitochondrial transport signal. Cry1 protein bound tightly to DNA
Sepharose, while Cry2 protein did not.

GENE FUNCTION

Griffin et al. (1999) showed that human CRY1 and CRY2 act as
light-independent inhibitors of a heterodimeric activator consisting of
CLOCK (601851) and BMAL1 (602550), the activator driving Per1 (602260)
transcription, very likely by means of direct contacts between CRY1 and
BMAL1 and between CRY2 and CLOCK. They concluded that CRY1 and CRY2
occupy a central position within the mammalian circadian clock,
virtually at the interface between CLOCK-BMAL1 and PER1, PER2 (603426),
and TIM (603887). Griffin et al. (1999) suggested that Drosophila CRY
exemplifies the ancestral role of the photoreceptor acting as a
light-dependent regulator of the circadian feedback loop, whereas
mammalian CRYs have preserved the role within the circadian feedback
loop but have shed their direct photoreceptor function.

Kume et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Cry1 and Cry2 genes act in
the negative limb of the clock feedback loop. They stated that mouse
Cry1 and Cry2 are nuclear proteins that interact with each of the Per
proteins, translocate each Per protein from cytoplasm to nucleus, and
are rhythmically expressed in the suprachiasmatic circadian clock.
Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that Cry1 or Cry2 alone abrogates
Clock/Bmal1 (602550) E box-mediated transcription. The mouse Per and Cry
proteins appeared to inhibit the transcriptional complex differentially.

Etchegaray et al. (2003) demonstrated that transcriptional regulation of
the core clock mechanism in mouse liver is accompanied by rhythms in H3
histone (see 602810) acetylation, and that H3 acetylation is a potential
target of the inhibitory action of Cry. The promoter regions of the
Per1, Per2, and Cry1 genes exhibited circadian rhythms in H3 acetylation
and RNA polymerase II (see 180660) binding that were synchronous with
the corresponding steady-state mRNA rhythms. The histone
acetyltransferase p300 (602700) precipitated with Clock in vivo in a
time-dependent manner. Moreover, the Cry proteins inhibited a
p300-induced increase in Clock/Bmal1-mediated transcription. Etchegaray
et al. (2003) concluded that the delayed timing of the Cry1 mRNA rhythm,
relative to the Per rhythms, was due to the coordinated activities of
Rev-Erb-alpha (602408) and Clock/Bmal1, and defined a novel mechanism
for circadian phase control.

Lamia et al. (2011) showed that 2 circadian coregulators, Cry1 (601933)
and Cry2, interact with glucocorticoid receptor (138040) in a
ligand-dependent fashion and globally alter the transcriptional response
to glucocorticoids in mouse embryonic fibroblasts: cryptochrome
deficiency vastly decreases gene repression and approximately doubles
the number of dexamethasone-induced genes, suggesting that cryptochromes
broadly oppose glucocorticoid receptor activation and promote
repression. In mice, genetic loss of Cry1 and/or 2 results in glucose
intolerance and constitutively high levels of circulating
corticosterone, suggesting reduced suppression of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis coupled with increased
glucocorticoid transactivation in the liver. Genomically, Cry1 and Cry2
associate with a glucocorticoid response element in the
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-1 (PCK1; 614168) promoter in a
hormone-dependent manner, and dexamethasone-induced transcription of the
Pck1 gene was strikingly increased in cryptochrome-deficient livers.
Lamia et al. (2011) concluded that their results revealed a specific
mechanism through which cryptochromes couple the activity of clock and
receptor target genes to complex genomic circuits underpinning normal
metabolic homeostasis.

In mammals, PERIOD (PER1; 602260 and PER2; 603426) and CRYPTOCHROME
(CRY1 and CRY2) proteins accumulate, form a large nuclear complex (PER
complex), and repress their own transcription. Padmanabhan et al. (2012)
found that mouse PER complexes included RNA helicases DDX5 (180630) and
DHX9 (603115), active RNA polymerase II large subunit (180660), Per and
Cry pre-mRNAs, and SETX (608465), a helicase that promotes
transcriptional termination. During circadian negative feedback, RNA
polymerase II accumulated near termination sites on Per and Cry genes
but not on control genes. Recruitment of PER complexes to the elongating
polymerase at Per and Cry termination sites inhibited SETX action,
impeding RNA polymerase II release and thereby repressing
transcriptional reinitiation. Circadian clock negative feedback thus
includes direct control of transcriptional termination.

MAPPING

Kobayashi et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Cry1 and Cry2 genes to
chromosomes 10C and 2E, respectively. Using a GeneBridge 4 radiation
hybrid panel, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the human CRY2 gene to
chromosome 11.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Xing et al. (2013) reported the crystal structures of mammalian CRY2 in
its apo, FAD-bound, and FBXL3 (605653)-SKP1 (601434)-complexed forms.
Distinct from other cryptochromes, mammalian CRY2 binds FAD dynamically
with an open cofactor pocket. Notably, the F-box protein FBXL3 captures
CRY2 by simultaneously occupying its FAD-binding pocket with a conserved
carboxy-terminal tail and burying its PER-binding interface.

ANIMAL MODEL

Van der Horst et al. (1999) disrupted the Cry1 and Cry2 genes in mice.
Homozygous Cry1 -/-, Cry2 -/-, and double-mutant mice had normal 24-hour
circadian rhythms when exposed to 12h/12h light/dark cycles. In total
darkness, Cry1 -/- mice had a faster running clock (22.51 +/- 0.06h, P =
0.00001) than wildtype mice, while Cry2 -/- mice had a slower clock
(24.63 +/- 0.06 hours, P = 0.00001). Double-mutant mice in total
darkness showed a striking instantaneous and complete arrhythmicity,
indicating the absence of an internal circadian clock. The 'clock'
mutant mouse differs in showing a more gradual onset of arrhythmicity.
Mice with only 1 copy of wildtype Cry2 displayed a free-running rhythm
even shorter than that of Cry1 knockouts, which gradually progressed
into arrhythmicity. Once returned to a light/dark cycle, the normal
24-hour period resumed. Mice with only one functional allele of Cry1
showed rhythmic activity with a period intermediate to those of Cry1 -/-
and Cry2 -/- mice. The authors concluded that their results demonstrated
that the Cry proteins are involved in maintaining period length and
circadian rhythmicity, and that a critical balance between Cry1 and Cry2
is required for proper clock functioning.

Thresher et al. (1998) disrupted the mouse Cry2 gene by homologous
recombination. The mutant mice had lowered sensitivity to acute light
induction of the Per1 gene in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but
exhibited normal circadian oscillations of Per1 and Cry1 mRNA in the
SCN. Behaviorally, the mutants had an intrinsic circadian period about 1
hour longer than normal and exhibited high amplitude phase shifts in
response to light pulses administered at circadian time 17. The authors
considered these data consistent with the hypothesis that Cry2 protein
modulates circadian responses in mice and suggested that cryptochromes
have a role in circadian photoreception in mammals.

Freedman et al. (1999) studied circadian behavior in mice deficient in
both rods and cones. These mice maintained a light-entrained circadian
rhythm, which they lost with enucleation. Lucas et al. (1999) studied
pineal melatonin secretion in mice lacking both rods and cones. There
was normal suppression of pineal melatonin in response to monochromatic
light of wavelength 509 nm. These authors concluded that mammals have
additional ocular photoreceptors which they use in the regulation of
temporal physiology, and suggested CRY1 and CRY2 as candidates.

Okamura et al. (1999) demonstrated that, in mice lacking Cry1 and Cry2,
cyclic expression of the clock genes Per1 and Per2 is abolished in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissues and that Per1 and Per2
mRNA levels are constitutively high. These findings indicated that the
biologic clock is eliminated in the absence of both Cry1 and Cry2 and
supported the idea that mammalian CRY proteins act in the negative limb
of the circadian feedback loop. The Cry double mutant mice retained the
ability to have Per1 and Per2 expression induced by a brief light
stimulus known to phase-shift the biologic clock in wildtype animals.
Thus, Cry1 and Cry2 are dispensable for light-induced phase shifting of
the biologic clock.

Shearman et al. (2000) demonstrated that in the mouse, the core
mechanism for the master circadian clock consists of interacting
positive and negative transcription and translation feedback loops.
Analysis of Clock/Clock mutant mice, homozygous Per2 mutants, and
Cry-deficient mice revealed substantially altered Bmal1 rhythms,
consistent with a dominant role of Per2 in the positive regulation of
the Bmal1 loop. In vitro analysis of Cry inhibition of
Clock:Bmal1-mediated transcription shows that the inhibition is through
direct protein-protein interactions, independent of the Per and Tim
proteins. Per2 is a positive regulator of the Bmal1 loop, and Cry1 and
Cry2 are the negative regulators of the Period and Cryptochrome cycles.

Yagita et al. (2001) used wildtype and Cry1 -/- and Cry2 -/- deficient
cell lines derived from Cry mutant mice to demonstrate that the
peripheral oscillator in cultured fibroblasts is identical to the
oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in (1) temporal expression
profiles of all known clock genes; (2) the phase of the various mRNA
rhythms (i.e., antiphase oscillation of Bmal1 (602550) and Per); (3) the
delay between maximum mRNA levels and appearance of nuclear Per1 and
Per2 protein; (4) the inability to produce oscillations in the absence
of functional Cry genes; and (5) the control of period length by Cry
proteins.

Van Gelder et al. (2003) tested pupillary light responses of
cryptochrome mutant mice (Cry1 -/-; Cry2 -/-), outer retinal degenerate
(rd/rd) mice, and mice mutant at all of these loci, as well littermate
controls. There was substantial loss of constriction in the rd/rd mice
compared with control mice. The double mutants for the cryptochromes
showed a pupillary response similar in magnitude to that in control
mice. Almost no pupillary constriction was observed in the triple
knockouts at a 470-nm light intensity. Pupillary responses of the triple
mutants were about 5% as sensitive to blue light as those of the rd/rd
mice. Some pupillary responses were retained in the triple mutant mice
under very bright light, although pupillary movement was somewhat
sluggish. The 50% constriction threshold of pupillary responses was
noted in Cry1 -/-;rd/rd and Cry2 -/-;rd/rd mice, and was comparable to
those of rd/rd mice, indicating that either Cry1 or Cry2 function is
sufficient for retention of pupillary responses in rd/rd animals. Since
all mice were of the same strain background, strain differences were
unlikely to account for the observed differences in pupillary light
responses. Van Gelder et al. (2003) suggested that murine cryptochromes
may function as inner retinal photopigments.

300885	TITLE *300885 CYTOCHROME c OXIDASE, SUBUNIT VIIb; COX7B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal component of the respiratory
chain complex of most aerobic organisms, is composed of 13 subunits in
mammals. Three COX subunits are encoded by mitochondrial DNA, and 10,
including COX7B, are encoded by nuclear DNA (summary by Sadlock et al.,
1993).

CLONING

By screening a human endothelial cell library with a partial bovine COX
VIIb cDNA, Sadlock et al. (1993) isolated a cDNA encoding human COX
VIIb. The predicted 80-amino acid human protein contains a 24-amino acid
leader sequence. The mature human and bovine COX VIIb polypeptides are
82% identical. Southern blot analysis indicated that the COX VIIb gene
is part of a large gene family in the human genome. In a review article,
Lenka et al. (1998) noted that the COX VIIb subunit is found in all
mammalian tissues.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the COX7B gene to chromosome Xq21.1 based on an
alignment of the COX7B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK311879) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 female patients with reticulolinear aplasia cutis congenita
associated with microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and other congenital
anomalies (APLCC; 300887), Indrieri et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion, a splice site mutation, and a
nonsense mutation, respectively (300885.0001-300885.0003).

ANIMAL MODEL

Indrieri et al. (2012) performed morpholino knockdown of cox7b in medaka
fish (Oryzias latipes) and observed a dose-dependent phenotype
characterized by microcephaly and microphthalmia, as well as severe
cardiac defects including failure of heart loop formation and
pericardial edema.

COX7B, 1-BP DEL, 196C

In a female patient with reticulolinear congenital skin defects,
microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and short stature (APLCC; 300887), who
was originally described by Zvulunov et al. (1998), Indrieri et al.
(2012) identified heterozygosity for a de novo 1-bp deletion (196delC)
in exon 3 of the COX7B gene, causing a frameshift predicted to result in
premature termination (Leu66CysfsTer48) and a mutant protein lacking the
domain that interacts with COX subunits COX4 (123864) and COX6C
(124090). The mutation was not found in her parents, in 200 ethnically
matched controls, or in the dbSNP or NHLBI Exome Variant Server
databases.

facial dysmorphism, short stature, atrial septal defect and ventricular
hypertrophy, right diaphragmatic hernia, and agenesis of the left kidney
with ureteral duplication of the right kidney (APLCC; 300887), Indrieri
et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a de novo A-G transition
(41-2A-G) in intron 1 of the COX7B gene, predicted to create a novel
splice acceptor site 1 base before the wildtype splice site
(Val14Glyfs*19). The mutation was not found in her parents or in the
dbSNP or NHLBI Exome Variant Server databases. In vitro analysis
demonstrated that 90% of mutant transcripts contained an additional
guanine at the start of exon 2, causing out-of-frame transcripts
predicted to result in premature termination.

In a girl with reticulolinear congenital skin defects of the face and
neck, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, tetralogy of Fallot, and
intellectual disability (APLCC; 300887), Indrieri et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a 55C-T transition in exon 2 of the COX7B
gene, resulting in a gln19-to-ter (Q19X) substitution. The nonsense
mutation was also present in heterozygosity in the proband's mother, who
was born with reticulolinear congenital skin defects of the face and
neck but had no other manifestations and normal cognitive function. The
proband's 3 healthy sisters and healthy brother all inherited the
wildtype allele from their mother, and the mutation was not found in the
dbSNP or NHLBI Exome Variant Server databases.

602137	TITLE *602137 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX, 2; NDUFA2
;;B8 PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NDUFA2 gene encodes one of the accessory subunits of complex I, the
first and largest complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Hoefs
et al., 2008).

For a discussion of complex I, see 516000.

CLONING

Dunbar et al. (1997) reported the genomic cloning and fluorescence in
situ hybridization mapping of 5 nuclear-encoded human complex I genes.

Ton et al. (1997) isolated human heart cDNAs encoding the CI-B8, CI-SGDH
(603841), CI-B14 (602138), CI-B12 (603839), and CI-KFYI (603844)
subunits of the HP fraction. Human and bovine B8 protein shared 94%
sequence identity.

Loeffen et al. (1998) noted that complex I can be fragmented into 3
different fractions. The flavoprotein fraction contains the NDUFV1
(161015), NDUFV2 (600532), and NDUFV3 (602184) subunits and the
iron-sulfur protein (IP) fraction contains at least 7 subunits,
NDUFS1-NDUFS6 (see, e.g., 157655) and NDUFA5 (601677). The remaining
subunits, including NDUFA2, are part of the hydrophobic protein (HP)
fraction, which is involved in proton translocation. Loeffen et al.
(1998) reported cDNA sequences of 8 nuclear-encoded subunits located
within the hydrophobic protein fraction of NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase.

MAPPING

Dunbar et al. (1997) mapped NDUFA2 to chromosome 5q31. Emahazion and
Brookes (1998) showed that of the 5 complex I genes mapped by Dunbar et
al. (1997), only the mapping of NDUFA2 was correct. (See NDUFA6
(602138), NDUFA7 (602139), NDUFB8 (602140), and NDUFS8 (602141).)

By intron-based radiation hybrid mapping, Emahazion and Brookes (1998)
mapped the NDUFA2 gene to chromosome 5q31.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a boy with Leigh syndrome (256000) due to mitochondrial complex I
deficiency (252010), Hoefs et al. (2008) identified a homozygous splice
site mutation in the NDUFA2 gene (602137.0001).

NOMENCLATURE

Mammalian complex I has been studied extensively in Bos taurus. The
names of some the bovine complex I subunits designate the single-letter
code for the 4 N-terminal amino acids (e.g., SGDH). The names of
subunits B8-B22 designate their molecular weights (Walker et al., 1992).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFA2, IVS2DS, G-A, +5

In a Turkish boy with Leigh syndrome (256000) due to mitochondrial
complex I deficiency (252010), born of first-cousin parents, Hoefs et
al. (2008) identified a homozygous G-to-A transition in intron 2 of the
NDUFA2 gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 2 and generation of a
prematurely truncated protein, which was confirmed by PCR analysis. He
had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and developmental delay from birth, and
brain MRI showed cerebral atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum.
After a varicella infection, he developed severe acidosis, seizures, and
coma, and died of cardiovascular arrest at age 11 months. MRI just
before death showed demyelinization of corticospinal tracts and subacute
necrotizing encephalomyelopathy consistent with Leigh syndrome. The
fibroblast and muscle complex I enzymatic activities were 36% and 20% of
control values, respectively. Further studies showed that the NDUFA2
mutation resulted in disturbed assembly and stability of complex I and
decreased complex I activity. In patient fibroblasts, the defect could
be corrected with a baculoviral vector.
