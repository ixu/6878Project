614471	TITLE *614471 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 19; USP19
;;KIAA0891
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

USP19 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (EC 3.4.19.12) with a role in
regulating cell cycle progression (Lu et al., 2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned USP19, which they designated
KIAA0891. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the ubiquitin protease UNPH (USP4; 603486). RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression in fetal liver, followed by adult spinal
cord. All other tissues, including adult and fetal brain, showed much
lower expression, and no expression was detected in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that
regulates the G1/S transition. Using rat myoblast and fibroblast cell
lines, Lu et al. (2009) showed that Usp19 regulated p27(KIP1) levels by
deubiquitinating and stabilizing Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that ubiquitinates cytosolic p27(KIP1) and targets it for
proteasomal degradation at G1 phase. Immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that Usp19 interacted directly with Kpc1. Knockdown of Usp19
resulted in loss of Kpc1, accumulation of p27(KIP1), inhibition of cell
proliferation, and slower progression from G0/G1 to S phase.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the USP19 gene
to chromosome 3.

Hartz (2011) mapped the USP19 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the USP19 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020698) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GTF2IRD1 gene was identified within the chromosomal region on
7q11.23 commonly deleted in Williams syndrome (194050) and is involved
in mammalian craniofacial and cognitive development (Tassabehji et al.,
2005).

CLONING

Tassabehji et al. (1999) isolated and characterized a 3.4-kb gene, which
they called general transcription factor III (GTF3), which occupies
about 140 kb of the region deleted in Williams syndrome. Northern blot
analysis showed that the gene is expressed in skeletal muscle and heart,
and RT-PCR analysis showed expression in a range of adult tissues with
stronger expression in fetal tissues. Part of the conceptual GTF3
protein sequence was found to be almost identical to a slow muscle-fiber
enhancer binding protein identified by O'Mahoney et al. (1998) and
termed MusTRD1. GTF3 showed significant homology to the 90-amino acid
putative helix-loop-helix repeat (HLH) domains of the transcription
factor TFII-I (GTF2I; 601679), which maps distal to GTF4 within the
Williams syndrome deleted region.

Osborne et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they termed
WBSCR11, by genomic DNA sequence analysis and screening of 2 colon
carcinoma cell line cDNA libraries. The cDNA sequence predicts an
895-amino acid protein.

Franke et al. (1999) cloned GTF2IRD1 from cDNA libraries representing
several diverse tissues, and they obtained a full-length cDNA by 5-prime
RACE of an adult brain cDNA library. They also identified several splice
variants arising from exon skipping. The longest deduced protein
contains 944 amino acids. In addition to the repeated GTF2I motifs and
HLH repeats, Franke et al. (1999) identified a myc (190080)-type HLH
dimerization domain, a number of putative phosphorylation sites and
N-myristoylation sites, an amidation site, and several putative nuclear
localization signals. Northern blot analysis detected expression of
GTF2IRD1 in all adult and fetal tissues except leukocytes. The dominant
transcript was 3.6 kb long, with sizes ranging from 1.5 kb to 5.0 kb.

By Western blot analysis, Yan et al. (2000) found that endogenous
GTF2IRD1, which they designated CREAM1, was expressed at low levels as a
120-kD protein in a variety of human cell lines and tissues. GTF2IRD1
was expressed in the nucleus of transfected cells, and deletion of the
C-terminal nuclear localization signal resulted in cytoplasmic
expression.

Bayarsaihan and Ruddle (2000) cloned mouse Gtf2ird1, which they
designated Ben. The deduced full-length 1,072-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal leucine zipper motif, followed by 6
helix-loop-helix domains, a nuclear localization signal, and a
C-terminal serine-rich region. Northern blot analysis detected several
Ben transcripts in all mouse tissues examined. Western blot analysis
showed several Ben isoforms with apparent molecular masses of 40 to 165
kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Osborne et al. (1999) determined that the WBSCR11 gene spans 95 kb of
genomic DNA and consists of 26 exons, not including the last noncoding
exon.

Franke et al. (1999) determined that the GTF2IRD1 gene contains up to 30
exons and spans about 105 kb. The coding sequence uses 26 exons.

Palmer et al. (2010) determined that the region upstream of the GTF2IRD1
gene contains a well-conserved CCAAT box and 3 canonical
GTF2IRD1-recognition sequences (GGATTA), one of which is inverted.

MAPPING

Franke et al. (1999) reported that the GF2IRD1 gene maps within the WBS
deletion region on chromosome 7q11.23 and is oriented 5-prime to 3-prime
in the centromeric to telomeric orientation.

Tassabehji et al. (1999) tabulated 11 genes in addition to GTF3 that had
been mapped to the deleted area of chromosome 7 in classic Williams
syndrome.

Lazebnik et al. (2008) stated that the mouse Gtf2ird1 gene maps to a
region of chromosome 5 that shares homology of synteny with human
chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Yan et al. (2000) determined that GTF2IRD1 interacted with the RB1
protein (614041) in vitro and in vivo. They also showed that full length
GTF2IRD1 stimulated transcription of a reporter gene and, by mutation
analysis, they localized the activation domain to the N terminus.

Using yeast 1-hybrid analysis, Bayarsaihan and Ruddle (2000) showed that
in vitro-translated mouse Ben interacted with an early enhancer upstream
of the Hoxc8 (142970) transcription start site.

Ring et al. (2002) characterized the Xenopus homolog of GTF2IRD1,
Xwbscr11. They determined that Xwbscr11 binds DNA via selective HLH
repeats and interacts with the transcription factor FOXH1 (603621) and
the signal transduction molecules Smad2 (601366) and Smad3 (603109) to
affect activin (147290)/nodal-mediated induction of the distal element
of the Xenopus goosecoid promoter.

Vullhorst and Buonanno (2003) characterized mouse Gtf3 splice variants.
They determined that HLH domain 4 is necessary and sufficient for
binding the bicoid-like motif of the troponin (191042) enhancer. An
isoform that lacks exon 23 and exons 26 through 28 interacted most
avidly with the bicoid-like motif. Isoforms that included these exons
failed to bind in gel retardation assays. The authors also determined
that Gtf3 polypeptides associate with each other via the leucine zipper.

Lazebnik et al. (2008) showed that BEN bound the 8-bp core consensus
sequence CAG(C/G)G(C/A)GA, surrounded by G- and C-rich sequences. BEN
repressed expression of a reporter gene containing 3 copies of the
sequence 5-prime-GGGGGCAGCGACAGCCCCC-3-prime. Knockdown of Ben
expression in C2C12 mouse myoblasts enhanced expression of Bmpr1b
(603248), Sox4 (184430), En1 (131290), and Fgf15, the mouse ortholog of
FGF19 (603891). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis followed by
quantitative PCR confirmed binding of BEN to Fgf15.

Palmer et al. (2010) found that GTF2IRD1 is subject to negative
autoregulation. All isoforms of mouse or human GTF2IRD1 bound 3
canonical GTF2IRD1-binding sites (GGATTA) in the region upstream of the
GTF2IRD1 gene. EMSA using artificial DNA probes and in vitro-translated
GTF2IRD1 revealed enhanced binding in the presence of 3 GGATTA sites and
dimerization of GTF2IRD1 proteins via an N-terminal leucine zipper
region. Binding by GTF2IRD1 repressed expression of a reporter gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tassabehji et al. (1999) found that GTF3 was deleted in patients with
classic Williams syndrome, but not in patients with partial deletions
who had only supravalvular aortic stenosis. They suggested that
haploinsufficiency of the GTF3 gene may be the cause of the abnormal
muscle fatigability that is characteristic of Williams syndrome.

Tassabehji et al. (2005) reported a rare WBS individual with an atypical
deletion, including the GTF2IRD1 gene, showed facial dysmorphism and
cognitive deficits that differed from those of classic WBS cases. They
proposed a mechanism of cumulative dosage effects of duplicated and
diverged genes applicable to other human chromosomal disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tassabehji et al. (2005) demonstrated that GTF2IRD1 is involved in
mammalian craniofacial and cognitive development. Gtf2ird1-null mice
exhibited phenotypic abnormalities reminiscent of the human
microdeletion disorder Williams-Beuren syndrome; craniofacial imaging
revealed abnormalities in both skull and jaws that may arise through
misregulation of goosecoid (138890), a downstream target of Gtf2ird1.

Palmer et al. (2010) found that mutant mice lacking Gtf2ird1 exon 2
expressed a mutant Gtf2ird1 transcript. The mutant transcript was
expressed at wildtype levels due to escape from nonsense mediated decay
and escape from negative autoregulation by Gtf2ird1 itself.

607082	TITLE *607082 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, ALPHA-2/DELTA SUBUNIT 2; CACNA2D2
;;KIAA0558
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CACNA2D2 gene encodes the alpha-2-delta-2 auxiliary subunit of high
voltage-gated calcium channels. Auxiliary subunits modulate calcium
current and channel activation and inactivation kinetics, and may be
involved in proper assembly and membrane localization of the channels.
Alpha-2-delta-2 is a receptor for the antiepileptic drug gabapentin
(summary by Edvardson et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching for sequences with the potential to encode large proteins
expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding
CACNA2D2, which they called KIAA0558. The deduced 1,145-amino acid
protein was predicted to be 45% identical to mouse Cacna2d2. RT-PCR
analysis detected ubiquitous expression.

Using a positional cloning strategy to identify a putative tumor
suppressor gene on chromosome 3p21.3, Gao et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA
encoding CACNA2D2. The CACNA2D2 protein is 56% identical to CACNA2D1
(114204), and 17 of 22 cysteines in CACNA2D2 are conserved in CACNA2S1,
suggesting similar secondary structures. CACNA2D2 also has multiple
putative N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a 5.5-kb transcript that was most abundant in lung and
testis, followed by brain, heart, and pancreas, with low levels in
prostate and skeletal muscle. Some lung cancer lines expressed CACNA2D2.
Western blot analysis showed expression of a 150-kD protein, larger than
the predicted 130 kD, presumably due to glycosylation. Functional
analysis indicated that CACNA2D2 is able to act as an auxiliary subunit
of all 3 subfamilies of voltage-gated calcium channels.

By physical cloning methodologies and bioinformatic computational
analyses, Lerman and Minna (2000) identified a number of genes,
including CACNA2D2, in a region of chromosome 3p21.3 that is associated
with a putative lung cancer tumor suppressor gene. They did not detect
CACNA2D2 mutations in any lung cancer cell lines tested.

Each alpha-2-delta subunit is encoded by a single gene and
post-translationally cleaved into a long, N-terminal, extracellular
alpha-2 protein and a shorter, membrane-anchored delta polypeptide; the
alpha-2 and delta proteins are covalently linked by disulfide bonds
(summary by Brill et al., 2004).

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) determined that
the CACNA2D2 gene contains at least 40 exons and spans approximately 140
kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the CACNA2D2
gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Gao et al. (2000)
refined the localization to 3p21.3, a site of frequent deletions in
breast and lung cancers.

GENE FUNCTION

Hoppa et al. (2012) showed that a trafficking step probably sets
synaptic voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) levels in rats, because
overexpression of the pore-forming alpha-1A VGCC subunit (CACNA1A;
601011) fails to change synaptic VGCC abundance or function.
Alpha-2-deltas are a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored VGCC-associated subunits that, in addition to being the
target of the potent neuropathic analgesics gabapentin and pregabalin
(alpha-2-delta-1 (CACNA2D1) and alpha-2-delta-2 (CACNA2D2)), were also
identified in a forward genetic screen for pain genes (alpha-2-delta-3
(CACNA2D3; 606399)). Hoppa et al. (2012) showed that these proteins
confer powerful modulation of presynaptic function through 2 distinct
molecular mechanisms. First, alpha-2-delta subunits set synaptic VGCC
abundance, as predicted from their chaperone-like function when
expressed in nonneuronal cells. Second, alpha-2-deltas configure
synaptic VGCCs to drive exocytosis through an extracellular metal
ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), a conserved set of amino acids
within the predicted von Willebrand A domain of alpha-2-delta.
Expression of alpha-2-delta with an intact MIDAS motif leads to an 80%
increase in release probability, while simultaneously protecting
exocytosis from blockade by an intracellular calcium chelator.
Alpha-2-deltas harboring MIDAS site mutations still drive synaptic
accumulation of VGCCs; however, they no longer change release
probability or sensitivity to intracellular calcium chelators. Hoppa et
al. (2012) concluded that their data reveal dual functionality of these
clinically important VGCC subunits, allowing synapses to make more
efficient use of calcium entry to drive neurotransmitter release.

ANIMAL MODEL

Brodbeck et al. (2002) showed that mice with the 'ducky' (du) mutation,
a model for absence epilepsy (see 600131), had a mutation in Cacna2d2
gene. The mutation resulted in the introduction of a premature stop
codon and the expression of a truncated protein encoded by the first 3
exons of Cacna2d2, followed by 8 novel amino acids. The shortened mRNA
and protein were expressed in mutant mouse cerebellum and Purkinje
cells. Brodbeck et al. (2002) detected high expression of the normal
protein in cerebellar Purkinje cells, but found that ducky mice had
abnormalities in their Purkinje cell dendritic trees. Functional
analysis indicated that the mutant Cacna2d2 protein failed to increase
or even decreased the peak current density of the voltage-gated Ca(V)2.1
(CACNA1A; 601011)/beta-4 (CACNB4; 601949) channel combination,
suggesting that it may contribute to the ducky phenotype.

Brill et al. (2004) identified a recessive mouse phenotype, 'entla,'
caused by an in-frame duplication of 39 amino acids in the Cacna2d2
gene, resulting in expression of a full-length, membrane-associated
protein, but with loss of the disulfide linkage between the 2 derived
proteins. Mutant mice developed ataxia by postnatal day 13 to 15
followed by paroxysmal dyskinesia. The mice showed reduced size and
weight, increased mortality before weaning, and female infertility. EEG
studies suggested absence epilepsy, with 2- and 4-Hz spike-wave
discharges in the cortex and hippocampus. Cerebellar Purkinje cells
isolated from mutant mice showed about a 50% reduction in current, as
well as a reduction of gabapentin binding to the membrane compared to
wildtype and to heterozygous mice. Entla (ent) mice showed no
neuroanatomical abnormalities.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CACNA2D2, LEU1040PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy has not
been confirmed.

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Arab-Palestinian parents, with early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy, global developmental delay, and
cerebellar atrophy, Edvardson et al. (2013) identified a homozygous
3119A-G transition in the CACNA2D2 gene, resulting in a leu1040-to-pro
(L1040P) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The variant, which
was identified by linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing,
was not found in 102 controls or in 6,503 control exomes. In vitro
expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed that the variant protein
decreased currents of N- and L-type calcium channels and caused slower
inactivation in N-type channels. Although the variant protein was
expressed, it showed decreased localization to the plasma membrane
compared to wildtype, suggesting that it may not properly associate with
the alpha-1 subunit. Edvardson et al. (2013) postulated that prolonged
channel opening and calcium influx during depolarization associated with
delayed inactivation may underlie the epileptic phenotype observed in
these patients. There was no evidence for a dominant-negative effect.
Exome sequencing in 1 of the 3 affected sibs also identified a
homozygous C-to-T transition in the CELSR3 gene (604264), resulting in a
met2630-to-ile (M2630I; 604264.0001) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. This variant also segregated with the disease state in the
family. Inactivation of Celsr3 in mice causes abnormalities in
connectivity in the cerebral cortex (Zhou et al., 2008). Edvardson et
al. (2013) could not exclude a role for the CELSR3 mutation in the
epileptic phenotype in this family.

610611	TITLE *610611 GINS COMPLEX SUBUNIT 4; GINS4
;;SLD5, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SLD5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The yeast heterotetrameric GINS complex is made up of Sld5, Psf1 (GINS1;
610608), Psf2 (GINS2; 610609), and Psf3 (GINS3; 610610). The formation
of the GINS complex is essential for the initiation of DNA replication
in yeast and Xenopus egg extracts (Ueno et al., 2005). See GINS1 for
additional information about the GINS complex.

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to yeast SLD5,
Takayama et al. (2003) identified GINS4, which they called SLD5. The
deduced protein contains 223 amino acids.

Using mouse Psf1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid analysis of an 11-day mouse
embryo cDNA library, Kong et al. (2006) cloned Sld5. The deduced
223-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a
central basic region, and a C-terminal domain that is conserved between
the mouse and yeast proteins. RT-PCR of mouse tissues detected abundant
expression in adult testis, and weak expression in thymus and bone
marrow. No Sld5 was detected in brain, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and
heart. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Psf1 and Sld5 in the
cytoplasm of transfected NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Kong et al. (2006) demonstrated that
mouse Sld5 and Psf1 interacted in transfected NIH3T3 cells.

MAPPING

International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GINS4 gene
to chromosome 8 (TMAP RH102031).

NOMENCLATURE

The GINS complex derives its name from the Japanese words Go, Ichi, Nii,
and San, which mean 5, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and refer to the
numbering of the yeast homologs of the GINS complex (Takayama et al.,
2003).
