DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NFKB1 (164011) or NFKB2 (164012) is bound to REL (164910), RELA
(164014), or RELB (604758) to form the NFKB complex. The NFKB complex is
inhibited by I-kappa-B proteins (NFKBIA, 164008, or NFKBIB, 604495),
which inactivate NF-kappa-B by trapping it in the cytoplasm.
Phosphorylation of serine residues on the I-kappa-B proteins by kinases
(IKBKA or IKBKB, 603258) marks them for destruction via the
ubiquitination pathway, thereby allowing activation of the NF-kappa-B
complex. Activated NFKB complex translocates into the nucleus and binds
DNA at kappa-B-binding motifs such as 5-prime GGGRNNYYCC 3-prime or
5-prime HGGARNYYCC 3-prime (where H is A, C, or T; R is an A or G
purine; and Y is a C or T pyrimidine).

CLONING

Helix-loop-helix proteins contain stretches of DNA that encode 2
amphipathic alpha-helices joined by a loop structure and are involved in
protein dimerization and transcriptional regulation essential to a
variety of cellular processes. Mock et al. (1995) performed mapping
studies of a new member of this family of proteins in the human and
mouse. The protein contains a serine/threonine kinase domain; due to its
ubiquitous expression in a broad array of tissues and high degree of
conservation across species, it was designated CHUK for 'conserved
helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase.' The multidomain polypeptide encoded
by the CHUK gene also contains leucine zipper motifs.

DiDonato et al. (1997) purified a cytokine-activated protein kinase
complex, IKK (for I-kappa-B kinase), that phosphorylates I-kappa-B
proteins on the sites that trigger their degradation. They molecularly
cloned and identified a component of IKK, IKK-alpha (CHUK), as a serine
kinase. Mercurio et al. (1997) independently purified CHUK, which they
called IKK1, from HeLa cells. They found that mutant forms of IKK1 had
less effect upon NFKB activation than did mutant forms of IKK2 (also
called IKBKB, IKK-beta, or IKKB). IKK-alpha is approximately 50%
identical to IKK-beta (603258), and both contain kinase, leucine zipper,
and helix-loop-helix domains. Although IKK-alpha and IKK-beta can
homodimerize, heterodimerization appears to be favored over
homodimerization (Mercurio et al., 1997).

By use of NF-kappa-B-inducing kinase (NIK; 604655) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a human B-cell line to identify NIK-interacting
proteins, Regnier et al. (1997) isolated CHUK, which phosphorylates
NFKBIA at ser32 and ser36 and NFKBIB at ser19 and ser23. The
phosphorylation of these proteins leads to the release of NFKB and
activation of nuclear genes. By screening a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library,
Regnier et al. (1997) obtained a full-length CHUK cDNA encoding a
745-amino acid protein that is 96% identical to mouse Chuk. A
catalytically inactive CHUK mutant acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor
of TNF (191160)-, IL1 (see 147760)-, TRAF2 (601895)-, and NIK-induced
NFKB activation.

Hu and Wang (1998) cloned and characterized IKKA and IKKB. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of major 3.6- and minor 7.0-kb IKKA
transcripts in all tissues tested, with highest levels in heart,
placenta, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate,
testis, and peripheral blood. IKKB was also ubiquitously expressed as
major 3.4- and minor 6.5-kb transcripts. Expression of both transcripts
was highest in 7-day mouse embryonic tissue. Hu and Wang (1998)
suggested that IKKA and IKKB may be functionally related and cooperate
in cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Delhase et al. (1999) demonstrated that in mammalian cells,
phosphorylation of 2 sites at the activation loop of IKK-beta was
essential for activation of IKK by TNF and IL1. Elimination of
equivalent sites in IKK-alpha did not interfere with IKK activation.
Thus IKK-beta, not IKK-alpha, is the target for proinflammatory stimuli.
Once activated, IKK-beta autophosphorylated at a carboxy-terminal serine
cluster. This phosphorylation decreased IKK activity and was suggested
to prevent prolonged activation of the inflammatory response.

Ozes et al. (1999) showed that AKT1 (164730) is involved in the
activation of NFKB1 by TNF, following the activation of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3; see 171834). Constitutively active
AKT1 induces NFKB1 activity, mediated by phosphorylation of IKK-alpha at
threonine 23, which can be blocked by activated NIK. Conversely, NIK
activation of NFKB1, mediated by phosphorylation of IKK-alpha at serine
176, is blocked by an AKT1 mutant lacking kinase activity (i.e., kinase
dead AKT), indicating that both AKT1 and NIK are necessary for TNF
activation of NFKB1 through the phosphorylation of IKK-alpha. IKK-beta
is not phosphorylated by either NIK or AKT1 and is apparently
differentially regulated.

May et al. (2000) determined that an N-terminal alpha-helical region of
NEMO (300248) associates with a region of IKKA and IKKB that they termed
the NBD for 'NEMO-binding domain.' The NBD is a 6-amino acid C-terminal
segment within the region denoted alpha-2 of IKKA and IKKB. Wildtype,
but not mutant, NDB peptide inhibited cytokine-induced NFKB activation
and ameliorated experimental acute inflammation.

Anest et al. (2003) demonstrated nuclear accumulation of IKKA after
cytokine exposure, suggesting a nuclear function for this protein.
Consistent with this, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that
IKKA was recruited to the promoter regions of NF-kappa-B-regulated genes
on stimulation with TNFA (191160). Notably, NF-kappa-B-regulated gene
expression was suppressed by the loss of IKKA, and this correlated with
a complete loss of gene-specific phosphorylation of histone H3 (see
602810) on serine-10, a modification previously associated with positive
gene expression. Furthermore, Anest et al. (2003) showed that IKKA can
directly phosphorylate histone H3 in vitro, suggesting a new substrate
for this kinase. Anest et al. (2003) proposed that IKKA is an essential
regulator of NFKB-dependent gene expression through control of
promoter-associated histone phosphorylation after cytokine exposure.

Yamamoto et al. (2003) independently demonstrated that IKKA functions in
the nucleus to activate the expression of NF-kappa-B-responsive genes
after stimulation with cytokines. IKKA interactions with CREB-binding
protein (600140) and in conjunction with RELA (164014) is recruited to
NF-kappa-B-responsive promoters and mediates the cytokine-induced
phosphorylation and subsequent acetylation of specific residues in
histone H3. Yamamoto et al. (2003) concluded that their results define a
new nuclear role of IKKA in modifying histone function that is critical
for the activation of NF-kappa-B-directed gene expression.

Using mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking both Ikbkb and Ikbka, Sizemore et
al. (2004) found that both proteins were required for induction of a
subset of Ifng (147570)-stimulated genes independent of Nfkb activation
and with no defect in Stat1 (600555) activation or function. Sizemore et
al. (2004) concluded that the IKK-dependent pathway is an additional
important pathway for IFNG-stimulated gene expression.

Hoberg et al. (2004) presented evidence that IKK-alpha phosphorylates
chromatin-bound SMRT (NCOR2; 600848), stimulating its removal from
chromatin and allowing recruitment of NFKB to promoters and
transcription of NFKB-dependent genes.

Park et al. (2005) presented evidence that IKKA is important for the
activation of estrogen-mediated gene expression.

Lawrence et al. (2005) described a role for IKK-alpha in the negative
regulation of macrophage activation and inflammation. IKK-alpha
contributes to suppression of NF-kappa-B activity by accelerating both
the turnover of the NF-kappa-B subunits Rela and c-Rel and their removal
from proinflammatory gene promoters. Inactivation of IKK-alpha in mice
enhanced inflammation and bacterial clearance. Lawrence et al. (2005)
concluded that the 2 IKK catalytic subunits have evolved opposing but
complementary roles needed for the intricate control of inflammation and
innate immunity.

Werner et al. (2005) demonstrated that different inflammatory stimuli
induce distinct IKK profiles, and they examined the underlying molecular
mechanisms. Although TNFA-induced IKK activity was rapidly attenuated by
negative feedback, lipopolysaccharide signaling and
lipopolysaccharide-specific gene expression programs were dependent on a
cytokine-mediated positive feedback mechanism. Thus, Werner et al.
(2005) concluded that the distinct biologic responses to LPS and TNFA
depend on signaling pathway-specific mechanisms that regulate the
temporal profile of IKK activity.

Using an RNA interference-based screen, Tang et al. (2006) found 4
negative regulators of insulin-responsive glucose transport in mouse
adipocytes: Pctk1 (311550), Pftk1 (610679), Ikbka, and Map4k4 (604666).

Wu et al. (2006) demonstrated that NEMO (300248), the regulatory subunit
of the IKK complex, associates with activated ATM (607585) after the
induction of DNA double-strand breaks. ATM is exported in a
NEMO-dependent manner to the cytoplasm, where it associates with and
causes the activation of IKK in a manner dependent on another IKK
regulator, a protein rich in glutamate, leucine, lysine, and serine
(ELKS; 607127). Thus, Wu et al. (2006) concluded that regulated nuclear
shuttling of NEMO links 2 signaling kinases, ATM and IKK, to activate
NF-kappa-B by genotoxic signals.

TLR7 (300365) and TLR9 (605474) associate with the cytoplasmic adaptor
protein MYD88 (602170), which associates with IRF7 (605047). IRF7
associates with TRAF6 (602355) and IRAK1 (300283), and these 3 proteins
are critical for induction of IFNA (IFNA1; 147660) production, but not
cytokine production. Hoshino et al. (2006) found that mouse plasmacytoid
dendritic cells deficient in Ikka were severely impaired in Tlr7- or
Tlr9-induced Ifna production, but were able to produce detectable
inflammatory cytokines. Expression of a kinase-deficient Ikka inhibited
the ability of Myd88 or Traf6 to activate the Ifna promoter in synergy
with Irf7. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that Ikka associated
with and phosphorylated Irf7. Hoshino et al. (2006) concluded that IKKA
is a critical component of the cytoplasmic
transductional-transcriptional processor leading to induction of IFNA
production.

Liu et al. (2006) identified somatic mutations in IKKA exon 15 in 8 of 9
squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) examined. More transition mutations than
transversion mutations were detected. In chemical carcinogen-induced
skin cancer in mice, overexpression of wildtype human IKKA reduced
development of SCCs and metastases. The IKKA transgene increased
terminal differentiation and reduced mitogenic activity in the
epidermis, and decreased angiogenic activity in the skin stroma. Liu et
al. (2006) concluded that IKKA in the epidermis antagonizes mitogenic
and angiogenic signals and represses tumor progression and metastases.

Zhu et al. (2007) identified 14-3-3-sigma (SFN; 601290) as a downstream
target of Ikka in cell cycle regulation in response to DNA damage and
found that the 14-3-3-sigma locus was hypermethylated in Ikka -/- mouse
keratinocytes, but not in wildtype keratinocytes. Trimethylated histone
H3-lys9 associated with Suv39h1 (300254) and Dnmt3a (602769) in the
methylated 14-3-3-sigma locus. Reintroduction of Ikka restored
14-3-3-sigma expression by associating with H3 and preventing access of
Suv39h1 to H3, thereby preventing hypermethylation of 14-3-3-sigma. Zhu
et al. (2007) concluded that IKKA protects the 14-3-3-sigma locus from
hypermethylation, which serves as a mechanism of maintaining genomic
stability in keratinocytes.

Mittal et al. (2006) found that the Yersinia YopJ virulence factor
inhibited the host inflammatory response and induced apoptosis of immune
cells by catalyzing acetylation of 2 ser residues in the activation loop
of MEK2 (MAP2K2; 601263), thereby blocking MEK2 activation and signal
propagation. YopJ also caused acetylation of a thr residue in the
activation loop of both IKKA and IKKB. Mittal et al. (2006) concluded
that ser/thr acetylation is a mode of action for bacterial toxins that
may also occur under nonpathogenic conditions to regulate protein
function.

Luo et al. (2007) examined IKK-alpha involvement in prostate cancer (see
176807) and its progression. They demonstrated that a mutation that
prevents IKK-alpha activation slowed down prostate cancer growth and
inhibited metastatogenesis in TRAMP mice, which express SV40 T antigen
in the prostate epithelium. Decreased metastasis correlated with
elevated expression of the metastasis suppressor Maspin (154790), the
ablation of which restored metastatic activity. IKK-alpha activation by
RANK ligand (RANKL; 602642) inhibited Maspin expression in prostate
epithelial cells, whereas repression of Maspin transcription required
nuclear translocation of active IKK-alpha. The amount of active nuclear
IKK-alpha in mouse and human prostate cancer correlated with metastatic
progression, reduced Maspin expression, and infiltration of prostate
tumors with RANKL-expressing inflammatory cells. Luo et al. (2007)
proposed that tumor-infiltrating RANKL-expressing cells leads to nuclear
IKK-alpha activation and inhibition of Maspin transcription, thereby
promoting the metastatic phenotype.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lahtela et al. (2010) detected 21 exons in the CHUK gene.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analyses, Mock et al. (1995) mapped the CHUK gene
to 10q24-q25. By a combination of somatic cell hybrid, recombinant
inbred, and backcross analyses, they mapped Chuk and a related sequence,
Chuk-rs1, to mouse chromosomes 19 and 16, respectively.

By FISH, Hu and Wang (1998) mapped the CHUK gene to chromosome 10q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lahtela et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a nonsense mutation
(600664.0001) in 2 fetuses from 1 family with autosomal recessive cocoon
syndrome (613630).

ANIMAL MODEL

Takeda et al. (1999) disrupted the Ikka gene in mice. Ikka -/- mice died
within 4 hours of birth. They had abnormal limb and craniofacial
development despite normal skeletal development. The skin appeared
abnormally shiny. The epidermal cells of Ikka-deficient mouse fetuses
were highly proliferative with dysregulated epidermal differentiation.
In the basal layer of the epidermis, degradation of I-kappa-B and
nuclear localization of NFKB were not observed. Thus, Ikka is essential
for NFKB activation in the limb and skin during embryogenesis.
Surprisingly, there was no impairment of NFKB activation in response to
either TNF-alpha or IL1 in Ikka-deficient embryonic fibroblasts or
thymocytes, indicating that Ikka is not essential for cytokine-induced
activation of NFKB.

Hu et al. (1999) generated Ikka-deficient mice. Homozygous mutant mice
died within 30 minutes of birth. At embryonic day 18, Ikka -/- mice had
rudimentary protrusions instead of normal limbs. They lacked well-formed
tails and their heads were shorter than normal, with a truncated snout
and no external ears. They had an omphalocele and taut skin. At autopsy,
there were no morphologic abnormalities of heart, lung, liver, kidneys,
spleen, brain, and spinal cord; however, the placentae were severely
congested with bulging vessels and blood sinuses on the maternal surface
and normal fetal surface. Skeletal preparations revealed fused sacral
and cervical vertebrae and a short sternum with delayed ossification and
split xiphoid. Microscopic examination of the skin revealed hyperplasia
of the stratum spinosum, and mutant epidermis lacked a stratum
granulosum and stratum corneum. The lack of Ikka appeared to completely
disrupt keratinocyte differentiation. Hu et al. (1999) hypothesized that
the increased thickness and adhesiveness of mutant skin prevented the
emergence of limb outgrowths.

Yoshida et al. (2000) examined wildtype and Ikka -/- mice on embryonic
days 18 and 19 by light and electron microscopy or immunocytochemistry.
During normal development of the conjunctiva and cornea, nuclear
localization of NFKB1 p50 was seen in areas where basal undifferentiated
cells give rise to differentiated cell types. However, in the Ikka -/-
tissues, no nuclear p50 staining was detected. The authors concluded
that IKKA is specifically required for formation of cornea and
conjunctiva. They stated that this function might be exerted through an
effect on NFKB activity.

Using an ex vivo mouse keratinocyte culture system, immunofluorescence
microscopy, and Western blot analysis, Hu et al. (2001) showed that
keratinocytes derived from Ikka-deficient mice exhibit a
hyperproliferative phenotype, fail to undergo terminal differentiation,
and do not express the appropriate differentiation markers, loricrin
(152445) and filaggrin (135940). This phenotype was observed in the
absence of a defect in NFKB activation. Introduction of Ikka into Ikka
-/- keratinocytes restores keratinocyte differentiation and filaggrin
expression. Mutation and immunoblot analysis established that induction
of keratinocyte differentiation does not require the protein kinase
activity of Ikka. Fetal Ikka -/- skin transplanted to immunodeficient
mice differentiated normally and expressed proliferation and
differentiation markers including Pcna (176740), Krt5 (148040), Krt1
(139350), and filaggrin, suggesting that normal skin contains a factor
that induces terminal differentiation of Ikka-deficient keratinocytes.
The authors demonstrated that wildtype keratinocytes produce,
independently of NFKB activation, a keratinocyte
differentiation-inducing factor (kDIF) protein. Hu et al. (2001)
concluded that the defect in Ikka -/- keratinocytes is continuous
proliferation even in the presence of growth-inhibiting levels of
extracellular calcium. Although Ikka is replaceable by, and is less
efficient than, Ikkb for activating NFKB, it is essential for normal
epidermal development.

By radiation chimera and flow cytometric analyses, Senftleben et al.
(2001) found reduced levels of mature B lymphocytes in spleen and lymph
nodes correlated with high turnover and apoptosis rates in immature B
cells in Ikka -/- reconstituted mice. In vivo, the spleens of chimeric
animals exhibited poor germinal center formation in response to
immunization. Immunoblot and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses
showed that Ikka -/- B cells contained little p52 and increased amounts
of p100, indicative of defective processing of NFKB2. Viable mice
carrying mutations in the activating phosphorylation sites of Ikka
(ser176 to ala and ser180 to ala) expressed a similar, sometimes more
severe, phenotype, suggesting a requirement for the phosphorylation of
these residues either by Ikka itself or by NIK. Recombinant Ikka was
much more efficient than Ikkb or NIK in phosphorylation of the
C-terminal regulatory domain of NFKB2, whereas it was less efficient in
the phosphorylation of IKBA. Senftleben et al. (2001) proposed that
defective NFKB2 processing likely interferes with B-cell maturation.
They concluded that IKKA is required for the activation of NFKB2, which
leads to B-cell maturation and germinal center formation.

Matsushima et al. (2001) found that both Nik -/- and Ikka -/- mice had
impaired NFKB activation in response to lymphotoxin B receptor (600979)
stimulation but not TNF receptor-1 (191190) stimulation. These mice also
had defective development of Peyer patches.

Cao et al. (2001) generated an Ikka(AA) knockin allele containing
alanines instead of serines in the activation loop. Ikka(AA/AA) mice
were healthy and fertile, but females displayed a severe lactation
defect due to impaired proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. Ikka
activity was required for NFKB activation in mammary epithelial cells
during pregnancy and in response to RANK ligand but not TNF. Ikka and
NFKB activation were also required for optimal cyclin D1 (168461)
induction. Defective RANK signaling or cyclin D1 expression resulted in
the same phenotypic effect as the Ikka(AA) mutation, which could be
completely suppressed by a mammary-specific cyclin D1 transgene. Thus,
IKKA is a critical intermediate in a pathway that controls mammary
epithelial proliferation in response to RANK signaling via cyclin D1.

Sil et al. (2004) postulated that the morphogenetic defects in
Ikk-alpha-deficient mice are not caused by reduced NF-kappa-B activity
but instead are due to failed epidermal differentiation that disrupts
proper epidermal-mesodermal interactions. Sil et al. (2004) tested this
hypothesis by introducing an epidermal-specific Ikka transgene into
Ikk-alpha-deficient mice. Mice lacking Ikk-alpha in all cell types
including bone and cartilage, but not in basal epidermal keratinocytes,
exhibit normal epidermal differentiation and skeletal morphology. Thus,
epidermal differentiation is required for proper morphogenesis of
mesodermally derived skeletal elements. One way by which IKK-alpha
controls skeletal and craniofacial morphogenesis is by repressing
expression of fibroblast growth factor family members, such as FGF8
(600483), whose expression is specifically elevated in the limb bud
ectoderm of Ikk-alpha-deficient mice.

Ohazama et al. (2004) determined that Ikka is expressed in mouse tooth
epithelium and has an essential role in incisor and molar tooth
development. Molar teeth in Ikka mutant mice had abnormal cusp
morphology due to a reduction of the Nfkb pathway. Incisors, however,
had a more severe and earlier phenotype where tooth buds failed to
invaginate into the underlying mesenchyme but instead evaginated into
the developing oral cavity. A similar evagination of epithelium was also
observed in whisker follicles. Unlike cusp morphogenesis, the Nfkb
pathway was not involved in the invagination of incisor tooth
epithelium. Changes in the expression of Notch1 (190198), Notch2
(600275), Wnt7b (601967), and Shh (600725) in incisor epithelium of Ikka
mutants suggested that the Nfkb-independent function is mediated by
Notch/Wnt/Shh signaling pathways.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COCOON SYNDROME
CHUK, GLN422TER

In 2 fetuses with cocoon syndrome (613630) from a Finnish family,
Lahtela et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 1264 in exon 12 of the CHUK gene, resulting in a glu-to-stop
substitution at codon 422 (E422X). This mutation was identified in
heterozygosity in both of the carrier parents and was not identified in
any of 100 ancestrally-matched control subjects. Fibroblast DNA from the
affected fetuses had no CHUK protein expression.

610932	TITLE *610932 TWINFILIN, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; TWF1
;;PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE 9; PTK9;;
A6 PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human embryonic lung fibroblast bacteria expression
library with antiphosphotyrosine antibody, Beeler et al. (1994) cloned
TWF1, which they called A6. The deduced 350-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 40.3 kD. TWF1 has an N-myristoylation site
and several sites for threonine, serine, and tyrosine phosphorylation,
but it lacks a conserved protein kinase catalytic domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 3.4-kb transcript that was highly expressed in
colon, testis, uterus, ovary, prostate, and lung. Lower expression was
detected in brain, bladder, and heart, and no expression was detected in
liver. In vitro transcription/translation resulted in a 40-kD TWF1
protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Southern blot analysis indicated
that TWF1 is conserved in vertebrates.

By searching databases for homologs of yeast twinfilin, Vartiainen et
al. (2000) identified mouse and human TWF1. The mouse and human TWF1
proteins contain 2 cofilin (see CFL1; 601442)-like repeats called
actin-depolymerizing factor (DSTN; 609114) homology (ADFH) domains.
Immunofluorescence microscopy localized Twf1 in a punctate perinuclear
distribution in mouse fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells. Twf1 also
localized to globular (G)-actin (see 102610)-rich areas of the actin
cytoskeleton in fibroblasts and to filamentous (F)-actin-rich filopodia
in neuroblastoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Beeler et al. (1994) showed that recombinant TWF1 underwent
autophosphorylation on tyrosines and serines in an in vitro kinase
assay, and it phosphorylated exogenous substrates on tyrosines.
Recombinant TWF1 had kinase activity similar to that of recombinant
FGFR2 (176943), with optimal activity over pH 6.5 to 7.4 and a
preference for manganese over magnesium as a divalent cofactor.

In contrast to the findings of Beeler et al. (1994), Vartiainen et al.
(2000) found that recombinant mouse Twf1 lacked tyrosine kinase
activity. They showed that Twf1 bound G-actin in a 1:1 stoichiometry and
prevented F-actin assembly in a concentration-dependent manner.
Overexpression of Twf1 in mouse fibroblasts decreased the amount of
stress fibers and caused the appearance of abnormal cytoplasmic actin
filaments. In mouse fibroblasts, Twf1 colocalized with GTP-bound forms
of Cdc42 (116952) and Rac1 (602048) at membrane ruffles and cell-cell
contacts, respectively, and localization of Twf1 in these cells appeared
to be regulated by Rac1.

Paavilainen et al. (2007) showed that the N- and C-terminal ADFH domains
of mouse Twf1, which they called TWF-N and TWF-C, respectively, were
required for actin barbed-end capping. NMR and mutagenesis analyses,
together with biochemical and motility assays, showed that TWF-C bound
G-actin and interacted with the sides of F-actin like ADF and cofilins,
whereas TWF-N bound only G-actin. During filament barbed-end capping,
TWF-N interacted with the terminal actin subunit, and TWF-C bound
between 2 adjacent subunits at the side of the filament. The domain
requirement for actin filament capping by Twf1 was similar to that of
gelsolin (GSN; 137350)-type proteins, suggesting the existence of a
general barbed-end capping mechanism.

In an adaptation of loss-of-function screening to mouse models of
cancer, Meacham et al. (2009) introduced a library of shRNAs into
individual mice using transplantable E-mu-myc lymphoma cells. This
approach allowed them to screen nearly 1,000 genetic alterations in the
context of a single tumor-bearing mouse. Their experiments identified a
central role for regulators of actin dynamics and cell motility in
lymphoma cell homeostasis in vivo. Validation experiments confirmed that
these proteins represent bona fide lymphoma drug targets. Additionally,
suppression of 2 of these targets, Rac2 (602049) and twinfilin
potentiated the action of the front-line chemotherapeutic vincristine,
suggesting a critical relationship between cell motility and tumor
relapse in hematopoietic malignancies.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TWF1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH70527).

601745	TITLE *601745 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY K, MEMBER 1; KCNK1
;;POTASSIUM CHANNEL, WEAKLY INWARD-RECTIFYING, WITH TWIN P DOMAINS,
1; TWIK1;;
K2P1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KCNK1 is a potassium-selective, pH-sensitive, openly rectifying channel
regulated by sumoylation (see SUMO1; 601912) (Rajan et al., 2005).

CLONING

Lesage et al. (1996) cloned a member of a new class of potassium
channels by computer identification of an EST with predicted sequence
similarity to the P domain, a region involved in the potassium
conduction pathway, of other channels. A cDNA, designated TWIK1 by the
authors, was obtained from a human kidney library and shown to encode a
predicted 336-amino acid protein. Unlike other potassium channels, TWIK1
has 4, rather than 6, transmembrane domains and 2, rather than 1, P
domains. Two genes from C. elegans are related. Northern blot analysis
showed that TWIK1 was widely expressed, with high levels in brain and
heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Lesage et al. (1996) found that human TWIK1 could direct expression of
weakly inward-rectifying potassium currents when expressed in Xenopus
oocytes. They speculated that TWIK1 channels may be involved in the
control of background potassium membrane conductances.

Rajan et al. (2005) found that K2P1 was sumoylated on intracellular
lys274 by Xenopus or human UBC9 (UBE2I; 601661) at the cell surface, and
that sumoylation rendered the channel inactive. Mutation of lys274 or
desumoylation of K2P1 by SENP1 (612157) activated the mute pore,
allowing its characterization. K2P1 functioned as a potassium-selective
leak channel with unitary conductance that passed larger outward than
inward currents under physiologic conditions. K2P1 was active at all
physiologic voltages and was sensitive to external pH via protonation of
conserved his122 in the first P loop. Rajan et al. (2005) concluded that
K2P1 is an openly rectifying potassium channel that is sensitive to pH
and regulated by sumoylation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Miller and Long (2012) presented the 3.4-angstrom resolution crystal
structure of a human K2P channel, K2P1 (TWIK1). Unlike other potassium
channel structures, K2P1 is dimeric. An extracellular cap domain located
above the selectivity filter forms an ion pathway in which potassium
ions flow through side portals. Openings within the transmembrane region
expose the pore to the lipid bilayer and are filled with electron
density attributable to alkyl chains. An interfacial helix appears
structurally poised to affect gating.

MAPPING

Lesage et al. (1996) mapped the KCNK1 gene by in situ hybridization to
1q42-q43.

;;KIAA0652;;
PARAPROTEIN TARGET 8; PARATARG8;;
PARATARG 8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Macroautophagy is a catabolic process for lysosome-mediated degradation
of cytoplasmic proteins, organelles, and macromolecules. ATG proteins,
such as ATG13, are required for formation of autophagosomes,
double-membrane vesicles that surround and sequester cytoplasmic cargo
prior to fusion with lysosomes (Mercer et al., 2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned ATG13, which they designated
KIAA0652. The deduced protein contains 517 amino acids. RT-PCR detected
high ATG13 expression in all 10 human tissues examined. SDS-PAGE
detected in vitro-translated ATG13 at an apparent molecular mass of 67
kD.

By searching databases for orthologs of yeast Atg13, Mercer et al.
(2009) identified human ATG13. The deduced protein contains 480 amino
acids. Database analysis showed that ATG13 is conserved from mammals to
lower eukaryotes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein interaction assays, Mercer et al. (2009) found that ATG13
interacted with ATG101 (615089) and with the macroautophagy proteins
ULK1 (603168) and FIP200 (RB1CC1; 606837). Immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that ATG13, ATG101, ULK1, and FIP200 formed a complex that
redistributed to punctate structures following starvation-induced
autophagy in HEK293 cells. Knockdown of ATG13 or ATG101 in starved
HEK293 cells reduced accumulation of a lipid-modified form of LC3B
(MAP1LC3B; 609604) that associates with autophagosomes. ATG13 was
required for ATG101 stabilization and localization in the autophagy
complex. ATG13 and ATG101 were required for formation of autophagosomes,
but not for downstream vesicle trafficking or fusion with lysosomes.
Incorporation of radiolabeled PO4 and phosphatase treatment showed that
ATG13 is phosphoprotein, but phosphorylation status of ATG13 had no
effect on the function of the autophagy complex or on ATG101 stability.

Using gel filtration and Western blot analysis of HeLa cell lysates,
Hosokawa et al. (2009) independently identified ATG101 as part of an
approximately 3-MDa autophagy complex including ULK1, ATG13, and FIP200.
ATG101 was also detected in complex with ATG13 only and as a monomer.
The distribution of ATG101 in the 3 fractions was unaltered by
starvation in HeLa cells. Use of small interfering RNA revealed that
ATG13 mediated interaction between ATG101 and ULK1 and that ATG101 was
required for the stability and basal phosphorylation of ATG13 and ULK1.
Knockdown of ATG101 inhibited formation of LC3-containing autophagosome
puncta.

Chan et al. (2009) found that human ATG13 interacted with mouse Ulk1 and
Ulk2 (608650), both of which phosphorylated ATG13.

Antigenic targets of paraproteins, or paratargs, may play a role in the
pathogenesis of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (see
153600), Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (see 153600), and multiple
myeloma (254500). Preuss et al. (2011) noted that all autoantigenic
paratargs, including ATG13, which they called paratarg-8, are
hyperphosphorylated in patients compared with healthy controls,
suggesting a general pathogenic mechanism. Using coimmunoprecipitation
analysis, Preuss et al. (2011) identified phosphokinase C (PKC)-zeta
(PRKCZ; 176982) as the kinase responsible for hyperphosphorylation of
paratarg-8 and most other autoantigenic paratargs tested. They
identified phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) as the phosphatase
responsible for dephosphorylation of all hyperphosphorylated
autoantigenic paratargs tested. Studies of carriers of
hyperphosphorylated and wildtype paratarg-7 (STOML2; 608292) suggested
that inactivation of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PPP2CA; 176915) via
tyr307 phosphorylation causes hyperphosphorylation of autoantigenic
paratargs.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the ATG13
gene to chromosome 11.

Hartz (2013) mapped the ATG13 gene to chromosome 11p11.2 based on an
alignment of the ATG13 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB014552) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;SODIUM CHANNEL, EPITHELIAL, DELTA SUBUNIT; SCNED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Amiloride-sensitive sodium channels (ASCs) are nonvoltage-gated
sodium-permeable ion channels inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. They
are well characterized in epithelia where they constitute the
rate-limiting step for sodium ion reabsorption. Waldmann et al. (1995)
identified a novel homolog of the alpha (600228), beta (600760), and
gamma (600761) amiloride-sensitive sodium channels in the EST sequence
database and cloned the gene from a human kidney cDNA library. This
3.4-kb cDNA encodes a protein of 638 amino acids. Waldmann et al. (1995)
termed this channel the delta isoform and they determined by Northern
analysis that it is expressed mainly in ovary, testis, pancreas, and
brain. After expression in Xenopus oocytes, the delta isoform induced an
amiloride-sensitive sodium current. The current produced by the delta
isoform was increased by a factor of 100 after coexpression of the beta
subunit and gamma subunit, suggesting to Waldmann et al. (1995) that the
delta subunit is part of a novel heteromultimeric channel formed of 3
subunits with the same overall structure but no more than 27-29%
sequence identity among them. The pharmacology, sensitivity to
amiloride, conductance, and ionic selectivity of the delta/beta-gamma
channel were different from those of the alpha/beta-gamma channel.

GENE FAMILY

Molecular cloning of the epithelial amiloride-sensitive sodium channel
demonstrated that it is made up of at least 3 homologous subunits,
termed alpha, beta, and gamma, which are also homologs of the degenerins
of C. elegans, proteins considered to be probable neuronal ion channels
(Waldmann et al., 1996). Gain-of-function mutations of members of this
group of ion channels are involved in hereditary diseases. Mutations of
the C. elegans degenerins are the major known cause of neurodegeneration
in the nematode, and gain of function of the amiloride-sensitive sodium
channel beta-subunit or gamma-subunit is the cause of Liddle syndrome
(177200), a form of hereditary hypertension. The gene encoding the alpha
subunit (SCNN1A) maps to 12p13; the genes encoding the beta subunit
(SCNN1B) and gamma subunit (SCNN1G) map within a 400-kb fragment on
16p12.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Waldmann et al. (1996) mapped the
gene encoding delta (SCNN1D) to 1p36.3-p36.2.

125240	TITLE *125240 CD55 ANTIGEN; CD55
;;DECAY-ACCELERATING FACTOR FOR COMPLEMENT; DAF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The major isoform of DAF, or CD55, is a 70-kD plasma membrane protein
that is widely distributed on all blood cells and on endothelial and
epithelial tissues. The physiologic role of DAF is to inhibit the
complement cascade at the level of the critical C3 (120700) convertase
step. By this mechanism, DAF protects autologous cells and tissues from
complement-mediated damage and thereby plays a role in preventing or
modulating autoimmune disease and inflammation. DAF also serves as a
receptor for certain strains of E. coli and certain types of
enteroviruses. Variation in DAF forms the basis of the Cromer blood
group system (CROM; 613793) (review by Lublin, 2005). In addition to the
major membrane-bound isoform of DAF, several other minor soluble and
membrane-bound DAF isoforms are produced by alternative splicing (Osuka
et al., 2006)

CLONING

Avoidance by host tissues of attack by autologous complement proteins is
dependent in part on the activities of membrane regulatory factors. One
molecule involved in this control is a 70-kD glycoprotein termed
decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Interruption by DAF of the complement
sequence at an early step in activation effectively halts progression of
the cascade and prevents consequent cell injury. In man, a
glycolipid-anchored form of DAF is expressed on the plasma membrane of
all cell types that are in intimate contact with plasma complement
proteins. DAF is also found on the surfaces of epithelial cells lining
extracellular compartments, and variants of DAF are present in body
fluids and in extracellular matrix. Medof et al. (1987) cloned cDNAs for
human DAF. The deduced 376-amino acid protein contains a 29-amino acid
N-terminal leader peptide, followed by 4 approximately 61-amino acid
repeats of internal homology, a 70-amino acid serine- and threonine-rich
segment with multiple potential O-glycosylation sites, and a C-terminal
hydrophobic segment. However, the sequence lacks an initiation codon,
indicating it is incomplete. Northern blot analysis of HeLa cells and
myeloid leukemia cells detected transcripts of 3.1, 2.7, and 2.0 kb.

Osuka et al. (2006) noted that glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored DAF (gDAF) and soluble DAF (sDAF) are generated by
alternative splicing. Insertion of a unique exon (exon 10) into the sDAF
cDNA causes a frameshift that results in a unique C-terminal sequence
lacking the GPI-anchored portion of gDAF. By RT-PCR of a lung cDNA
library, Osuka et al. (2006) cloned 5 additional minor DAF variants.
Three of the variants, vDAF1, vDAF2, and vDAF3, include novel exons
(exons 11, 12, and 13, respectively) compared with gDAF and, like sDAF,
encode proteins lacking the GPI-anchored portion in the C terminus.
Variants vDAF4 and vDAF5 include part or all of intron 7, respectively,
and encode proteins that retain the GPI-anchored portion of the C
terminus but have expanded central STP-rich regions. PCR analysis
detected expression of the DAF variants in almost all tissues examined,
with higher expression of all variants in lung, liver, and peripheral
blood compared with colon and stomach. The main band was derived from
gDAF. Transfection of vDAF1, vDAF2, and vDAF3 into Chinese hamster ovary
cells resulted in the secretion of these isoforms into the culture
medium. Each was highly O-glycosylated prior to secretion. vDAF4 was
expressed as a highly O-glycosylated membrane-bound protein.

GENE FUNCTION

CD55 is deficient in red blood cells from patients with paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria (300818). Hamann et al. (1996) found that CD55
is the cellular ligand for CD97 (601211). Erythrocytes from patients
with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria failed to adhere to cells
expressing CD97.

The placenta is an immunologically privileged site. Using DNA
microarrays to compare gene expression patterns, Sood et al. (2006)
found that 3 regulators of complement, CD55, CD59 (107271), and MCP, are
expressed at higher levels in normal placental villus sections compared
with other normal human tissues. Within the placenta, CD55 and CD59 are
expressed at greatest levels in amnion, followed by chorion and villus
sections, whereas MCP is expressed at higher levels only in villus
sections. These inhibitors of complement are expressed on
syncytiotrophoblasts, the specialized placental cells lining the villi
that are in direct contact with maternal blood. The amnion compared with
chorion is remarkably nonimmunogenic, and the immune properties of the
amnion are intriguing because it is not in direct contact with maternal
cells. Sood et al. (2006) suggested that the amnion may secrete the
complement inhibitors themselves or in the form of protected exosomes
into the amniotic fluid or the neighboring maternofetal junction.

Capasso et al. (2006) showed that stimulation of CD4 (186940) cells
through engagement of CD55, either with monoclonal antibodies or with
CD97, together with anti-CD3, led to enhanced T-cell proliferation,
cytokine production, and expression of activation markers. This
activation did not affect CD55-mediated complement inhibition and
suggested a novel role for CD55.

Using differential display PCR, Brandt et al. (2005) identified a CD55
splice variant that was overexpressed in a breast cancer cell line
displaying increased transendothelial invasiveness. In situ
hybridization of tissue microarrays and RT-PCR analysis showed the
splice variant was expressed in a proportion of invasive breast cancer
tissues but not in normal mammary tissue. Western blot analysis detected
the dominant full-length protein at an apparent molecular mass of 70 kD
and the isoform at about 45 kD. The isoform was detected in cytoplasm
and secreted into the culture medium.

Group B coxsackieviruses (CVBs) must cross the epithelium to initiate
infection. Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR, or CXADR;
602621), which mediates attachment and infection by all CVBs, is a
component of the tight junction (TJ) and is inaccessible to virus
approaching from the apical surface. Using Caco2 human colorectal
carcinoma cells, Coyne and Bergelson (2006) showed that CVB attachment
to DAF on the apical cell surface activated ABL (189980), triggering
RAC1 (602048)-dependent actin rearrangements that permitted virus
movement to the TJ. Within the TJ, interaction with CAR promoted
conformational changes in the virus capsid that were essential for virus
entry and release of viral RNA. Interaction with DAF also activated FYN
(137025), which was required for phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (CAV1;
601047) and transport of the virus into the cell within caveolar
vesicles. Coyne and Bergelson (2006) concluded that CVBs exploit
DAF-mediated signaling pathways to surmount the epithelial barrier.

GENE STRUCTURE

Osuka et al. (2006) determined that the CD55 gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

Lublin et al. (1987) and Lemons et al. (1987) found by study of
hamster-human somatic cell hybrids with DAF cDNA clones and by in situ
hybridization using the same clones that the gene is located at 1q32.
Thus, DAF is closely linked to structural genes for 4 other complement
proteins, C4-binding protein (C4BPA; 120830), CR1 (120620), CR2
(120650), and factor H (CFH; 134370), with which it shares 60-amino acid
repeats as well as functional similarities. Their close genetic linkage
suggests that this complement regulatory gene family evolved from an
ancestral C3b-binding molecule.

Hourcade et al. (1992) described 9 overlapping YACs that encompassed a
genomic region of 800 kb, encoding 4 RCA (regulator of complement
activation) genes and 3 RCA-gene-like elements. An arrangement of CR1,
MCP-like, CR1-like, and MCP (120920), in that order, strongly suggested
that this region of 1q was generated by a single duplication of
neighboring CR1/CR1-like and MCP/MCP-like forerunners.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Cromer Blood Group System: Inab Phenotype

The Cromer Inab phenotype, or Cromer null, in which red blood cells lack
all Cromer system antigens, is very rare. The red blood cells of
individuals with Inab phenotype have a deficiency of DAF, but they are
not known to have any associated hematologic or other abnormalities. In
the individual in which the Inab phenotype was first detected, Lublin et
al. (1994) demonstrated a nonsense mutation in exon 2 of the DAF gene
(125240.0001). The mutation truncated DAF near the N terminus,
explaining the complete absence of surface DAF in the red cells of the
individual.

In a 28-year-old Japanese woman, Wang et al. (1998) demonstrated that
the Cromer Inab phenotype was due to homozygosity for a 1579C-A
transversion at the position 24 bp upstream of the 3-prime end of exon 2
of the CD55 gene (125240.0002). This substitution resulted in an mRNA
with a 26-bp deletion, which introduced a frameshift and created a stop
codon immediately downstream of the deletion. Translation of the mRNA
would be terminated at the first amino acid of the second short
consensus repeat (SCR2) domain of DAF. The woman and her brother, who
also had the Cromer-null phenotype, had no history of intestinal
disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lin et al. (2002) demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to experimental
autoimmune myasthenia gravis (254200) in mice lacking Daf. Following
anti-AChR Ab injection, Daf1 -/- mice (devoid of neuromuscular DAF
protein) showed dramatically greater muscle weakness than their Daf1 +/+
littermates. Reversal of the weakness by edrophonium was consistent with
a myasthenic disorder. Immunohistochemistry revealed greatly augmented
C3b deposition localized at postsynaptic junctions, and
radioimmunoassays showed more profound reductions in AChR levels.
Electron microscopy demonstrated markedly greater junctional damage in
the Daf1 -/- mice compared with the Daf1 +/+ littermates.

Liu et al. (2005) found that Daf -/- mice had significantly enhanced
T-cell responses after immunization. This phenotype was characterized by
hypersecretion of Ifng (147570) and Il2 (147680), as well as
downregulation of Il10 (124092) upon restimulation of lymphocytes in
vitro. Daf1 -/- mice also displayed exacerbated disease progression and
pathology in the T cell-dependent experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Both T-cell responses and EAE disease
severity could be attenuated by neutralization of the complement system.
Liu et al. (2005) concluded that there is a critical link between the
complement system and T-cell immunity and proposed that DAF may have a
role in organ transplantation and vaccine development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CROMER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, Inab PHENOTYPE
CD55, TRP53TER

In the first individual discovered to have the Cromer Inab phenotype
(613793), i.e., absence of all Cromer system antigens on red blood
cells, Lublin et al. (1994) found a G-to-A transition, converting codon
53 in the CD55 gene from TGG (trp) to TGA (stop). The resulting
truncation near the amino terminus explained the complete absence of
surface DAF in the subject.

.0002
CROMER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, Inab PHENOTYPE
CD55, 26-BP DEL

In a 28-year-old Japanese woman, Wang et al. (1998) demonstrated that
the Cromer Inab phenotype (613793) was due to homozygosity for a 1579C-A
transversion at the position 24 bp upstream of the 3-prime end of exon 2
of the CD55 gene. This substitution caused the activation of a novel
cryptic splice site and resulted in the production of mRNA with a 26-bp
deletion. The deletion introduced a frameshift and created a stop codon
immediately downstream of the deletion. Translation of mRNA would be
terminated at the first amino acid residue of the second short consensus
repeat (SCR2) domain (exon 3) of DAF. The functional domains of DAF's
complement regulatory activity and the C-terminal signal domains for
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring were predicted to be
lacking in the subject. The subject and her brother, who also had the
Cromer-null phenotype, had no history of intestinal disease.
