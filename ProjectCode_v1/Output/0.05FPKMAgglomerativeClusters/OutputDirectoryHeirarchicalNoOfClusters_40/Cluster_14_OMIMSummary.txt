DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are nuclear receptors that mediate gene
regulation by thyroid hormone (TH, or T3). TRs form monomers,
homodimers, or heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs; see 180245)
at target DNA binding sites called TH-responsive elements (TREs). Two
different genes, THRA and THRB (190160), encode TRs, and both genes
produce multiple TR isoforms through alternative splicing (summary by
Nagaya et al., 1996).

CLONING

Thompson et al. (1987) isolated a cDNA derived from rat brain messenger
RNA on the basis of homology to the human thyroid receptor gene.
Expression of this cDNA produced a high-affinity binding protein for
thyroid hormone. Messenger RNA from this gene was expressed in
tissue-specific fashion, with highest levels in the central nervous
system and no expression in liver.

Nakai et al. (1988) isolated a cDNA encoding a specific form of thyroid
hormone receptor expressed in human liver, kidney, placenta, and brain.
Identical clones were found in human placenta. The cDNA encodes a
protein of 490 amino acids with a molecular mass of 54.8 kD. Designated
thyroid hormone receptor type alpha-2 (THRA2), this protein was
represented by mRNAs of different sizes in liver and kidney, possibly
representing tissue-specific processing of the primary transcript. Nakai
et al. (1988) suggested that the thyroid hormone receptor isolated from
a testis library by Benbrook and Pfahl (1987) may be identical to THRA2.

Sakurai et al. (1989) used Northern blot analysis to study the
distribution and abundance of mRNAs for the 3 thyroid hormone receptors,
beta, alpha-1, and alpha-2. The 3 mRNAs were expressed in all tissues
examined, and the relative amounts of the 3 were roughly parallel. None
of the 3 mRNAs was abundant in liver, the major thyroid
hormone-responsive organ, suggesting that another thyroid hormone
receptor may be present in liver.

Miyajima et al. (1989) reported that the human EAR7 generates 2
alternatively spliced forms, EAR71 and EAR72. The EAR71 protein is the
human counterpart of the chicken c-erbA protein.

Koenig et al. (1989) found that alternative splicing of the rat
Erba-alpha gene results in 2 proteins, Erba-alpha-1 and Erba-alpha-2,
that differ at their C-terminal ends.

Laudet et al. (1991) reported that a 5-kb THRA1 mRNA encodes a predicted
410-amino acid protein, and that a 2.7-kb THRA2 mRNA encodes a 490-amino
acid protein. The proteins differ at their C-terminal ends. Nagaya et
al. (1996) stated that a third isoform, THRA3, is derived by alternative
splicing. The proximal 39 amino acids of the THRA2-specific sequence are
deleted in THRA3.

Maternal thyroid hormone is transferred to the fetus early in pregnancy
and is postulated to regulate brain development. Iskaros et al. (2000)
investigated the ontogeny of TR isoforms and related splice variants in
9 first-trimester fetal brains by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis.
Expression of the TR-beta-1, TR-alpha-1, and TR-alpha-2 isoforms was
detected from 8.1 weeks' gestation. An additional truncated species was
detected with the TR-alpha-2 primer set, consistent with the TR-alpha-3
splice variant described in rat. All TR-alpha-derived transcripts were
coordinately expressed and increased approximately 8-fold between 8.1
and 13.9 weeks' gestation. A more complex ontogenic pattern was observed
for TR-beta-1, suggestive of a nadir between 8.4 and 12.0 weeks'
gestation. The authors concluded that these findings point to an
important role for the TR-alpha-1 isoform in mediating maternal thyroid
hormone action during first-trimester fetal brain development.

GENE STRUCTURE

Laudet et al. (1991) reported that the THRA gene contains 10 exons
spanning 27 kb of DNA. The last 2 exons of the gene are alternatively
spliced.

Miyajima et al. (1989) reported studies on the structure and function of
the EAR1 (602408) and EAR7 genes, both located on chromosome 17q21. They
determined that an exon in the EAR7 coding sequence overlaps an exon of
EAR1, and that the 2 genes are transcribed from opposite DNA strands.

MAPPING

Dayton et al. (1984) assigned the ERBA oncogene to chromosome 17, and
Spurr et al. (1984) confirmed this assignment. Both Dayton et al. (1984)
and Spurr et al. (1984) showed that the ERBA locus remains on chromosome
17 in the t(15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL;
612376). The thymidine kinase (188300) locus is probably translocated to
chromosome 15; study of leukemia with t(17;21) and apparently identical
breakpoint showed that TK was on 21q+.

Jhanwar et al. (1985) performed in situ hybridization of a cloned DNA
probe of ERBA to meiotic pachytene spreads obtained from uncultured
spermatocytes. They concluded that ERBA is situated at chromosome
17q21.33-17q22, in the same region as the break that generates the
t(15;17) seen in APL. Because most of the grains were seen in 17q22,
they suggested that ERBA is probably in the proximal region of 17q22 or
at the junction between 17q22 and 17q21.33.

By in situ hybridization, Le Beau et al. (1985) placed ERBA at
chromosome 17q11-q12 and demonstrated that it remains on chromosome 17
in APL, whereas TP53 (191170), at chromosome 17q21-q22, is translocated
to chromosome 15.

Ferro and San Roman (1981) discovered a constitutional t(15;17)
translocation apparently identical to that of APL. Molecular genetic
studies showed, however, that they are different: ERBA moves to
chromosome 15 in the constitutional translocation. Mitelman et al.
(1986) performed high resolution chromosome analysis on bone marrow
cells from 4 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia associated with
t(15;17) and in lymphocytes from 2 unrelated phenotypically normal
persons with an apparently identical constitutional translocation. In
all 6 cases the breakpoints were localized to subbands 15q22.3 and
17q11.2 in prophase-prometaphase chromosomes. Thus, ERBA must be at
17q11.2 just proximal to the breakpoint in the APL translocation and
just distal to it in the constitutional translocation.

By family linkage studies, Anderson et al. (1993) placed the THRA1 gene
on the genetic map of 17q in relation to other genes and DNA markers.

GENE FUNCTION

Debuire et al. (1984) found that ERBA, which potentiates ERBB (131550),
has an amino acid sequence different from that of other known oncogene
products and related to those of the carbonic anhydrases. ERBA
potentiates ERBB by blocking differentiation of erythroblasts at an
immature stage. Carbonic anhydrases participate in the transport of
carbon dioxide in erythrocytes. Sap et al. (1986) and Weinberger et al.
(1986) showed that the ERBA protein is a high-affinity receptor for
thyroid hormone. The cDNA sequence indicates a relationship to
steroid-hormone receptors, and binding studies indicate that it is a
receptor for thyroid hormones. It is located in the nucleus, where it
binds to DNA and activates transcription.

Koenig et al. (1989) showed that the rat Erba-alpha-1 isoform bound T3,
whereas the Erba-alpha-2 isoform did not. Erba-alpha-2 antagonized T3
binding and responsiveness by Erba-alpha-1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Congenital Nongoitrous Hypothyroidism 6

In a 6-year-old girl with congenital nongoitrous hypothyroidism (CHNG6;
614450), Bochukova et al. (2012) performed whole-exome sequencing and
identified a de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in the THRA gene
(E403X; 190120.0001) that generates a mutant protein that inhibits
wildtype receptor action in a dominant-negative manner.

In a father and daughter with congenital nongoitrous hypothyroidism, van
Mullem et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in
the THRA gene (190120.0002).

- Nonfunctioning Pituitary Adenomas, Somatic Mutations

McCabe et al. (1999) hypothesized that aberrant THRA expression in
nonfunctioning pituitary tumors may reflect mutations in the receptor
coding and regulatory sequences. They screened THRA mRNA and THRB
response elements and ligand-binding domains for sequence anomalies.
Screening THRA mRNA from 23 tumors by RNase mismatch and sequencing
candidate fragments identified 1 silent and 3 missense mutations, 2 in
the common THRA region (S45I and K370N) and 1 that was specific for the
alpha-2 isoform (S377L). No THRB response element differences were
detected in 14 nonfunctioning tumors, and no THRB ligand-binding domain
differences were detected in 23 nonfunctioning tumors. The authors
suggested that the novel thyroid receptor mutations may be of functional
significance in terms of thyroid receptor action, and that further
definition of their functional properties may provide insight into the
role of thyroid receptors in growth control in pituitary cells.

- Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma, Somatic Mutations

Puzianowska-Kuznicka et al. (2002) tested the hypothesis that the
functions of TRs could be impaired in cancer tissues by aberrant
expression and/or somatic mutations. As a model system, they selected
human thyroid papillary cancer. They found that the mean expression
levels of THRB mRNA and THRA mRNA were significantly lower, whereas the
protein levels of THRB1 and THRA1 were higher in cancer tissues than in
healthy thyroid. Sequencing of THRB1 and THRA1 cDNAs, cloned from 16
papillary cancers, revealed that mutations affected receptor amino acid
sequences in 93.75% and 62.5% of cases, respectively. In contrast, no
mutations were found in healthy thyroid controls, and only 11.11% and
22.22% of thyroid adenomas had such THRB1 or THRA1 mutations,
respectively. The majority of the mutated TRs lost their transactivation
function and exhibited dominant-negative activity. The authors concluded
that these findings suggest a possible role for mutated thyroid hormone
receptors in the tumorigenesis of human papillary thyroid carcinoma.

ANIMAL MODEL

To evaluate the respective contributions of THRA and THRB in the
regulation of CYP7A (118455), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis
of bile acids, Gullberg et al. (2000) studied the responses to 2%
dietary cholesterol and T3 in THRA and THRB knockout mice under hypo-
and hyperthyroid conditions. Their experiments showed that the normal
stimulation in CYP7A activity and mRNA level by T3 is lost in THRB -/-,
but not in THRA -/-, mice, identifying THRB as the mediator of T3 action
on CYP7A and, consequently, as a major regulator of cholesterol
metabolism in vivo. Somewhat unexpectedly, T3-deficient THRB -/- mice
showed an augmented CYP7A response after challenge with dietary
cholesterol, and these animals did not develop hypercholesterolemia to
the extent that wildtype controls did. The authors concluded that the
latter results lend strong support to the concept that THRs may exert
regulatory effects in vivo independent of T3.

Mutations in the THRB gene result in resistance to thyroid hormone. To
address the question of whether mutations in the THRA gene can lead to a
similar disease, Kaneshige et al. (2001) prepared mutant mice by
targeting the same THRB mutation found in kindred PV, a 1-bp insertion
in the THRB gene (190160.0011), into the Thra1 gene by homologous
recombination. The PV mutation was derived from a patient with severe
resistance to thyroid hormone who had a frameshift of the C-terminal 14
amino acids of THRB1. They compared mice heterozygous for the Thr-alpha
mutation with mice heterozygous for the Thr-beta mutation. Heterozygous
Thr-alpha-1 mutant mice were viable, indicating that the mutation is not
an embryonic lethal. In drastic contrast to the heterozygous beta mice,
which did not exhibit a growth abnormality, the heterozygous alpha mice
were dwarfs. These dwarfs exhibited increased mortality and reduced
fertility. In contrast to the heterozygous beta mice, which had a
hyperactive thyroid, the heterozygous alpha mice exhibited mild thyroid
failure. The in vivo patterns of abnormal regulation of T3 target genes
in heterozygous alpha mice were different from those of heterozygous
beta mice. The distinct phenotypes exhibited by the heterozygous
Thr-alpha-1 and Thr-beta mice indicated that the in vivo functions of
thyroid hormone receptor mutants are isoform-dependent. The heterozygous
alpha mice may be useful as a tool to uncover human diseases associated
with mutations in the THRA gene, and, furthermore, to understand the
molecular mechanisms by which thyroid hormone receptor isoforms exert
their biologic activities.

Ng et al. (2001) determined that a targeted mutation in the THRA gene
suppresses deafness and thyroid hyperactivity in transgenic Thrb-null
mice. The THRA splice variant TR-alpha-1 receptor is nonessential for
hearing, and the shorter TR-alpha-2 splice variant has unknown function
but neither binds thyroid hormone nor transactivates. The targeted
mutation deletes TR-alpha-2 and concomitantly causes overexpression of
TR-alpha-1 as a consequence of the exon structure of the gene. The
Thra-null mice had normal auditory thresholds, suggesting that
TR-alpha-2 is dispensable for hearing, and have only marginally reduced
thyroid activity. However, a potent function for the mutated allele was
revealed upon its introduction into Thrb-null mice, where it suppressed
the auditory and thyroid phenotypes caused by loss of THRB. The authors
proposed a modifying function for a THRA allele and suggested that
increased expression of TR-alpha-1 may substitute for the absence of
THRB.

HISTORY

Jansson et al. (1983) demonstrated that both human and mouse DNA have 2
distantly related classes of ERBA genes and that in the human genome
multiple copies of one of the classes exist.

Thompson et al. (1987) suggested that there may be as many as 5
different but related loci encoding thyroid hormone receptors. Many of
the clinical and physiologic studies suggested the existence of multiple
receptors. For example, patients had been identified with familial
thyroid hormone resistance in which peripheral response to thyroid
hormones is lost or diminished while neuronal functions are maintained
(Menezes-Ferreira et al., 1984). Thyroidologists recognize a form of
cretinism in which the nervous system is severely affected and another
form in which the peripheral functions of thyroid hormone are more
dramatically affected.

The identification of the several types of thyroid hormone receptor may
explain the normal variation in thyroid hormone responsiveness of
various organs and the selective tissue abnormalities found in the
thyroid hormone resistance syndromes. See, for example, the sibship
reported by Refetoff et al. (1972), in which several members who were
resistant to thyroid hormone action had retarded growth, congenital
deafness, and abnormal bones, but had normal intellect and sexual
maturation, as well as augmented cardiovascular activity. In this
family, Bernal et al. (1978) demonstrated abnormal T3 nuclear receptors
in blood cells, and Ichikawa et al. (1987) demonstrated the same in
fibroblasts. The availability of cDNAs encoding the various thyroid
hormone receptors was considered useful in determining the underlying
genetic defect in this family.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOTHYROIDISM, CONGENITAL, NONGOITROUS 6
THRA, GLU403TER

In a 6-year-old girl of white European origin with congenital
nongoitrous hypothyroidism (CHNG6; 614450), Bochukova et al. (2012)
performed whole-exome sequencing and identified a de novo heterozygous
1207G-T transversion in the THRA gene, resulting in a glu403-to-ter
(E403X) substitution, predicted to cause premature termination with loss
of the C-terminal alpha-helix. The mutation was not found in published
normal genomes and exomes or in 200 ethnically matched control alleles.
Functional analysis demonstrated that the mutant receptor did not
activate a thyroid hormone-responsive reporter gene and mediated
substantial repression of basal promoter activity, consistent with
negligible binding of radiolabeled triiodothyronine to mutant TR-alpha.
Coexpression studies showed that the E403X receptor strongly inhibited
transcriptional activity by wildtype TR-alpha in a dominant-negative
manner. Patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated markedly
reduced basal and triiodothyronine-induced expression of the thyroid
hormone-responsive target gene KLF9 (602902) compared to wildtype.
Two-hybrid interaction assays revealed strong recruitment of
corepressors by E403X mutant TR-alpha, with failure of their
hormone-dependent dissociation, and minimal triiodothyronine-dependent
association with coactivator SRC1 (602691).

HYPOTHYROIDISM, CONGENITAL, NONGOITROUS 6
THRA, 1-BP INS, 1190T

In a father and daughter with congenital nongoitrous hypothyroidism
(CHNG6; 614450), van Mullem et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for
a 1-bp insertion (1190insT) in the THRA gene, causing a frameshift
predicted to result in premature termination (F397fs406X). The mutation
was not found in the unaffected mother, in 300 Caucasian controls, or in
public databases. Transfection studies showed that the mutant receptor
does not respond to stimulation by T3, and also exerts a strong
dominant-negative effect on wildtype THRA.

116820	TITLE *116820 CATHEPSIN H; CTSH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a probe deduced from the amino acid sequence of mature human
cathepsin H, Fuchs et al. (1988) obtained a cathepsin H clone from a
kidney cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a mature 220-amino acid protein
plus 28 amino acids of the propeptide. The protein has 2 potential sites
for N-glycosylation, one in the prosequence and another in the mature
sequence. Proteolytic processing of the propeptide and cleavage between
asn177 and gly178 produces the mature enzyme with both heavy and light
chains. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.7-kb cathepsin H transcript
in kidney and inflamed tonsil, but not in placenta or liver.

Fuchs and Gassen (1989) cloned human preprocathepsin H, a lysosomal
cysteine proteinase. The prepro sequence consists of 115 amino acids.

MAPPING

Using previously identified cathepsin cDNAs as hybridization probes,
Wang et al. (1987) mapped CTSH to chromosome 15q24-q25. They noted that
a form of Batten disease (see 204200), representing perhaps about
one-fourth of all cases, has been found to show deficiency of cathepsin
H.

Deussing et al. (1997) mapped Ctsh to mouse chromosome 9 by linkage
analysis. A related sequence was identified on the X chromosome, which
may represent a pseudogene or a gene of a closely related cysteine
proteinase.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association of mutation in the CTSH gene
with myopia, facial dysmorphism, and hearing loss, see 116820.0001.

ANIMAL MODEL

Aldahmesh et al. (2013) examined eyes from Ctsh -/- mice and observed a
markedly abnormal posterior chamber with a configuration suggestive of
increased axial lengthening, compared to the rounded appearance in
wildtype littermates.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CTSH, 4-BP DEL, 485CTGT

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to myopia, facial dysmorphism, and hearing loss has not
been confirmed.

In a 1-year-old boy from a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family with
extreme myopia, facial dysmorphism, and hearing loss, Aldahmesh et al.
(2013) identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (c.485_488delCTGT;
Alkuraya, 2013) in the CTSH gene, causing a frameshift predicted to
result in a premature termination codon (Leu162ProfsTer66). The mutation
was present in heterozygosity in his unaffected parents and brother, and
was not found in 210 Saudi exome files or in the SNP databases of the
1000 Genomes Project and the Exome Variant Server. RT-PCR showed a 90%
reduction in mutant transcription compared to controls, presumably due
to nonsense-mediated decay. Alkuraya (2013) noted that the patient's
other eye was phthisical subsequent to retinal detachment caused by the
very large globe; the patient also exhibited dysmorphic features,
including hypertelorism, large forehead, and low-set, posteriorly
rotated ears, and had hearing loss.

600169	TITLE *600169 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX CLASS I CHAIN-RELATED GENE A; MICA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes typically encode
polymorphic peptide-binding chains that are ubiquitously expressed and
mediate the recognition of intracellular antigens by cytotoxic T cells.
Motivated by the association of HLA-B27 with rheumatoid and inflammatory
diseases, Bahram et al. (1994) found a family of sequences in the human
MHC that are highly divergent from all of the known MHC class I genes
and were presumably derived early in the evolution of mammalian class I
genes. These MIC genes (for MHC class I chain-related genes) evolved in
parallel with the human class I genes and with those of most, if not
all, mammalian orders. Bahram et al. (1994) cloned the MICA gene in this
family and stated that it was by far the most divergent mammalian MHC
class I gene known. The MICA gene encodes a 383-amino acid polypeptide
with a predicted mass of 43 kD. It is further distinguished by its
unusual exon-intron organization and preferential expression in
fibroblasts and epithelial cells. However, the presence of distinctive
residues in the MICA amino acid sequence translated from cDNA suggested
that the putative MICA chain folds similarly to typical class I chains
and may have the capacity to bind peptide or other short ligands. Thus,
a second lineage of evolutionarily conserved MHC class I genes was
defined by these results. MICA and other members of this family may have
been selected for specialized functions that are either ancient or
derived from those of typical MHC class I genes, in analogy to some of
the nonclassic mouse H-2 genes.

MAPPING

Bahram et al. (1994) demonstrated that the MICA gene is located near
HLA-B (142830) on chromosome 6. Nalabolu et al. (1996) showed that the
MICA and MICB (602436) genes occur in a 200-kb region spanning the TNFA
(191160) and TNFB (153440) cluster at chromosome 6p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

T cells with variable region V-delta-1 gamma/delta T-cell receptors (see
TCRG, 186970, and TCRD, 186810) are distributed throughout the human
intestinal epithelium and may function as sentinels that respond to self
antigens. The expression of MICA matches this localization. Groh et al.
(1998) found that MICA and the closely related MICB were recognized by
intestinal epithelial T cells expressing diverse V-delta-1 gamma/delta
TCRs. These interactions involved the alpha-1/alpha-2 domains of MICA
and MICB but were independent of antigen processing. With intestinal
epithelial cell lines, the expression and recognition of MICA and MICB
could be stress induced. Thus, these molecules may broadly regulate
protective responses by the V-delta-1 gamma/delta T cells in the
epithelium of the intestinal tract.

Bauer et al. (1999) found that MICA binds NKG2D (KLRK1; 611817) on
gamma/delta T cells, CD8+ alpha/beta T cells, and natural killer (NK)
cells. Engagement of NKG2D activated cytolytic responses of gamma/delta
T cells and NK cells against transfectants and epithelial tumor cells
expressing MICA. These results defined an activating immunoreceptor-MHC
ligand interaction that may promote antitumor NK- and T-cell responses.

MIC engagement of NKG2D stimulates NK-cell and T-cell effector
functions. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection induces the expression of
stress proteins such as HSP70 (140550). By flow cytometric analysis,
Groh et al. (2001) showed that CMV infection also induces MIC expression
and a concurrent downregulation of MHC class I molecules on fibroblasts
and endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections
from patients with CMV interstitial pneumonitis confirmed that induction
of MIC expression also occurs in vivo. Functional analysis of T-cell
cytotoxicity against CMV-infected fibroblasts showed that early after
infection when MIC expression was low, antibodies to MHC class I, but
not to MIC or NKG2D, could block T cell-mediated cytolysis. As MIC
expression increased, antibody masking of MIC or NKG2D reduced target
cell lysis; anti-MHC class I antibodies further reduced cytolysis. The
presence of MICA on stimulator cells also substantially enhanced
cytokine release by T-cell clones, and anti-MIC antibody abrogated this
production, suggesting that the MIC-NKG2D interaction provides an
important costimulatory activity.

Groh et al. (2002) showed that NKG2D binding of MIC induces endocytosis
and degradation of NKG2D. In cancer patients, NKG2D expression was
markedly reduced in both CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells and in
peripheral blood T cells, associated with circulating tumor-derived
soluble MICA. The downregulation of NKG2D causes a severe impairment of
tumor antigen-specific effector T cells. Groh et al. (2002) proposed
that this mode of T cell silencing through MIC shedding may promote
tumor immune evasion and inferred that it could also compromise host
resistance to infections.

Using immunohistopathologic and flow cytometric analyses, Hue et al.
(2004) found increased expression of MICA at epithelial cell surfaces in
celiac disease (CD; 212750) patients exposed to gliadin. Patient biopsy
specimens exposed to an IL15 (600554)-inducing gliadin fragment did not
express MICA in the presence of anti-IL15. Cytotoxicity assays showed
that NKG2D played primarily a costimulatory role on intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IELs), with a TCR-mediated signal required for complete
activation. However, in refractory celiac sprue patients, NKG2D mediated
a direct activating signal. ELISA detected soluble MICA in serum in half
of untreated CD patients, but in few patients on gluten-free diets; the
presence of soluble MICA was independent of MICA genotype. Hue et al.
(2004) proposed that villous atrophy in CD may be ascribed to
IEL-mediated damage to enterocytes involving NKG2D-MICA interaction
after gliadin-induced expression of MICA on gut epithelium.

Kriegeskorte et al. (2005) showed that the NKG2D ligands H60 and MICA
could mediate strong suppressive effects on T-cell proliferation. The
suppression did not occur in Il10 (124092)-deficient mice and involved a
receptor other than NKG2D. Kriegeskorte et al. (2005) concluded that
NKG2D ligands can induce strong inhibitory effects in addition to
stimulatory effects

Kaiser et al. (2007) showed that on the surface of tumor cells, MICA
associates with endoplasmic reticulum protein-5 (ERP5; 611099), which,
similar to protein disulfide isomerase (176790), usually assists in the
folding of nascent proteins inside cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of
thioreductase activity and ERP5 gene silencing revealed that
cell-surface ERP5 function is required for MICA shedding. ERP5 and
membrane-anchored MICA formed transitory mixed disulfide complexes from
which soluble MICA was released after proteolytic cleavage near the cell
membrane. Kaiser et al. (2007) suggested that reduction of the seemingly
inaccessible disulfide bond in the membrane-proximal alpha-3 domain of
MICA must involve a large conformational change that enables proteolytic
cleavage. They concluded that their results uncovered a molecular
mechanism whereby domain-specific deconstruction regulates MICA protein
shedding, thereby promoting tumor immune evasion, and identified surface
ERP5 as a strategic target for therapeutic intervention.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Using multiwavelength-anomalous dispersion phases at a resolution of 2.7
angstroms, Li et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of MICA and
NKG2D. They showed that NKG2D forms a homodimer that interacts with a
MICA monomer.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The predicted amino acid sequence of the MICA chain suggests that it
folds similarly to typical class I chains and may have the capacity to
bind peptides or other short ligands (Bahram et al., 1994). Therefore,
MICA was predicted to have a specialized function in antigen
presentation or T cell recognition. During nucleotide sequence analyses
of the MICA genomic clone, Mizuki et al. (1997) found a triplet repeat
microsatellite polymorphism (GCT/AGC)n in the transmembrane region of
the MICA gene. In 68 HLA homozygous B cell lines, 5 distinct alleles of
this microsatellite sequence were detected. One of them contained an
additional 1-bp insertion that created a frameshift resulting in a
premature termination codon in the transmembrane region. This particular
allele was thought to encode a soluble, secreted form of the MICA
molecule. Mizuki et al. (1997) also investigated this microsatellite
polymorphism in 77 Japanese patients with Behcet disease (109650), which
had previously been known to be associated with HLA-B51. The
microsatellite allele consisting of 6 repetitions of GCT/AGC was present
at significantly higher frequency in the patient population (Pc =
0.00055) than in a control population. Furthermore, the (GCT/AGC)6
allele was present in all B51 positive patients and in an additional 13
B51 negative patients. These results suggested the possibility of a
primary association of Behcet disease with MICA rather than HLA-B.

Wallace et al. (1999) investigated the association of the 16 previously
described external domain alleles and the transmembrane triplet repeats
of the MICA gene with Behcet disease in a Middle Eastern population. The
results showed an increase of MICA*009 in the Behcet disease patient
group (44 of 95; 46%) compared with controls (24 of 102; 24%), giving an
odds ratio (OR) of 2.8. The A6 form of a MICA transmembrane triplet
repeat was found to be significantly raised in the patients (80 of 95;
84%) compared with controls (58 of 102; 57%), giving an OR of 4. The
most significant association was that between Behcet disease and
HLA-B51. Wallace et al. (1999) interpreted the data as indicating that
since both MICA*009 and A6 are in strong linkage disequilibrium with
HLA-B51, they are unlikely to be the susceptibility genes for Behcet
disease but may be markers for additional risk factors.

Mizuki et al. (2000) studied the localization of the pathogenic gene of
Behcet disease using microsatellite analysis of 3 different populations:
Japanese, Greek, and Italian. In genotypic differentiation between
patients and controls, the authors found that only HLA-B51 was
significantly associated with BD in all 3 populations. These results
suggested that the pathogenic gene of BD is HLA-B51 itself and not other
genes located in the vicinity of HLA-B.

The MICA and MICB genes are polymorphic, displaying an unusual
distribution of a number of variant amino acids in their extracellular
alpha-1, alpha-2, and alpha-3 domains. To further define the
polymorphism of MICA, Petersdorf et al. (1999) examined its alleles
among 275 individuals with common and rare HLA genotypes. Of 16
previously defined alleles, 12 were confirmed, and 5 new alleles were
identified. A 2-by-2 analysis of MICA and HLA-B alleles uncovered a
number of significant associations. These results confirmed and extended
previous knowledge on the polymorphism of MICA. Petersdorf et al. (1999)
suggested that a strong positive linkage of certain MICA and HLA-B
alleles may have implications for studies related to MHC-associated
diseases and transplantation.

Komatsu-Wakui et al. (1999) studied polymorphisms in the MICA gene in
Japanese. They observed 8 MICA alleles in Japanese individuals, among
which 1, tentatively named MIC-AMW, had not previously been reported.
There was a strong linkage disequilibrium between MICA and HLA-B loci;
each MICA allele showed strong association with a particular HLA-B
group. Komatsu-Wakui et al. (1999) also identified a MICA-MICB null
haplotype, which was associated with HLAB*4801. In this haplotype, they
found large-scale deletion (of approximately 100 kb), including the
entire MICA gene, and a MICB gene that possessed a stop codon.

To summarize, the MICA gene has a microsatellite repeat, GCT(n), within
exon 5, encoding for a variable number of alanines (Ala = A).
Perez-Rodriguez et al. (2000) described a novel MICA allele with 10 GCT
repeats (A10); 4 different repeats of this microsatellite had been
previously reported: A4, A5, A6, and A9. An association of Behcet
disease with the A9 repeat had been reported by Mizuki et al. (1997).

Gambelunghe et al. (2001) concluded the existence of distinct genetic
markers for childhood/young-onset IDDM (222100) and for adult-onset
IDDM, namely the MICA5 and MICA5.1 alleles, respectively.

Mei et al. (2009) analyzed the relationship between Chlamydia
trachomatis, tubal pathology, and MICA allele polymorphisms in 214
infertile Chinese women. They found no association between MICA alleles
and the presence or absence of tubal pathology in infertile women with
antibodies to C. trachomatis. However, an association was found between
the MICA*008 allele and infertile women without antibodies to C.
trachomatis. Mei et al. (2009) concluded that MICA may modify host
susceptibility to C. trachomatis infection.

Aquino-Galvez et al. (2009) analyzed the MICA gene in 80 sporadic
patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; 178500) and 201
controls and found a significant increase of MICA*001 allele in the IPF
cohort (odds ratio, 2.91; corrected p = 0.03). In addition, the MICA
*001/*00201 genotype was significantly increased in patients with IPF
compared with healthy controls (odds ratio, 4.72; corrected p = 0.01).
Strong immunoreactive MICA staining was localized in alveolar epithelial
cells and fibroblasts from IPF lungs, whereas control lungs were
negative. Soluble MICA was detected in 35% of IPF patients compared to
12% of control subjects (p = 0.0007). The expression of the MICA
receptor NKG2D (KLRK1; 611817) was significantly decreased in
gamma/delta T cells and natural killer cells obtained from IPF lungs.
Aquino-Galvez et al. (2009) concluded that MICA polymorphisms and
abnormal expression of NKG2D might contribute to IPF susceptibility.

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the MICA
region and progression from chronic hepatitis C to hepatocellular
carcinoma, see 114550.

ANIMAL MODEL

The MICA/MICB locus is not conserved in mice; however, mice do have
counterpart NKG2D ligands, Rae1-beta and H60. Diefenbach et al. (2001)
demonstrated that ectopic expression of these ligands in tumor cell
lines resulted not only in potent rejection mediated by either NK cells
or CD8-positive T cells, but that mice subsequently challenged with
tumor cell lines not expressing the ligands were also immune to the
tumors. Girardi et al. (2001) determined that immunity to cutaneous
malignancies could be mediated by NKG2D-expressing intraepithelial
gamma/delta T cells. Girardi et al. (2001) proposed that the diverse
expression of NKG2D on cytolytic cell types may allow attacks on tumor
cells in different anatomical compartments and that gamma/delta T cells
may be particularly important in skin and gut.

602516	TITLE *602516 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 4; RGS4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins have been shown to
accelerate the GTPase activities of G protein alpha-subunits, thus
driving G proteins into their inactive GDP-bound forms. See 602189 for
further background information.

CLONING

By searching for homologs of the yeast SST2 gene product, which
regulates G protein signaling, Druey et al. (1996) cloned RGS4 cDNAs
from rat and human brain cDNA libraries. The human RGS4 cDNA encodes a
predicted 205-amino acid protein that is 97% identical to rat Rgs4.
Northern blot analysis detected a single human RGS4 transcript that was
expressed exclusively in brain. RGS4 partially complemented a yeast SST2
mutation, but it required the G protein alpha-subunit to function. Druey
et al. (1996) suggested that RGS4, and presumably other RGSs, negatively
regulate signaling upstream or at the level of the heterotrimeric G
protein.

Koelle and Horvitz (1996) cloned a human RGS4 cDNA by searching for
homologs of the C. elegans egl-10 gene (see 602517).

Using RT-PCR, Ruiz de Azua et al. (2010) found that Rgs4 was highly
expressed in the MIN6 murine insulinoma cell line and in mouse
pancreatic islets.

GENE FUNCTION

Ruiz de Azua et al. (2010) showed that knockdown of Rgs4 in MIN6 cells
caused a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular calcium,
increased basal insulin release, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion. Rgs4 coimmunoprecipitated with M3 muscarinic receptor (M3R,
or CHRM3; 118494) from transfected COS-7 cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sierra et al. (2002) determined that RGS4 contains 5 exons and spans 5.5
kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sierra et al. (2002) mapped the RGS4 gene
to chromosome 1q23.3. They mapped the mouse Rgs4 gene to chromosome 1 by
interspecific backcross mapping.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the RGS4
gene and schizophrenia, see 181500.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ruiz de Azua et al. (2010) found that Rgs4 deficiency in mice enhanced
M3r-mediated insulin secretion. Pancreatic beta cell-specific Rgs4
knockout did not alter basal glucose levels, but it increased plasma
insulin levels and increased insulin release after administration of a
muscarinic agonist. Ruiz de Azua et al. (2010) concluded that RGS4 acts
as a negative regulator of M3R signaling in pancreatic beta cells.

162323	TITLE *162323 TACHYKININ RECEPTOR 1; TACR1
;;NEUROKININ 1 RECEPTOR; NK1R;;
SUBSTANCE P RECEPTOR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hopkins et al. (1991) isolated functional cDNA clones for human NK1
receptor from human lung RNA using PCR. They then screened a human
cosmid library and isolated a clone that appeared to contain the entire
NK1 receptor gene. A full-length cDNA predicted a peptide of 407 amino
acids, with 89% homology to the rat protein.

Fong et al. (1992) cloned a splice variant of human NK1R that encodes a
311-amino acid protein with a truncated C terminus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gerard et al. (1991) found that the NK1R gene spans 45 to 60 kb and
comprises 5 exons with introns interrupting at sites homologous to those
in the NK2 receptor gene (162321).

GENE FUNCTION

Gerard et al. (1991) demonstrated that, when transfected into COS-7
cells, the NK1 receptor was selective for substance P; the relative
affinity for neurokinin A (162320) and neurokinin B (162330) was 100-
and 500-fold lower, respectively.

Fong et al. (1992) found that the truncated NK1R isoform expressed in
COS cells bound substance P with an affinity at least 10-fold lower than
that of the full-length form. Furthermore, it elicited an
electrophysiologic response to peptide agonists only weakly in Xenopus
oocytes. Fong et al. (1992) concluded that the full-length and truncated
NK1R isoforms couple to different effector systems.

Using RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy, Lai et al. (2006) found
that undifferentiated THP1 monocyte/macrophage cells expressed the
truncated NK1R isoform, whereas differentiated THP1 cells expressed the
full-length isoform. Exposure of differentiated THP1 cells to substance
P (SP) induced a Ca(2+) increase. In contrast, SP treatment did not
trigger Ca(2+) response in undifferentiated cells, but it did enhance
CCL5 (187011)-mediated Ca(2+) release. Introduction of full-length NK1R
into undifferentiated THP1 cells resulted in Ca(2+) release in response
to SP. Treatment of either cell type with an antagonist of NK1R-SP
binding blocked Ca(2+) release, including that mediated by CCL5.

Neurons in lamina I of the spinal dorsal horn express the NK1 receptor
for substance P and mediate hyperalgesia, an enhanced sensitivity to
painful stimuli. Ikeda et al. (2003) demonstrated that in these but not
in other nociceptive lamina I cells, NK1 receptor-activated signal
transduction pathways and activation of low-threshold (T-type)
voltage-gated calcium channels synergistically facilitate activity- and
calcium-dependent long-term potentiation at synapses from nociceptive
nerve fibers. Thereby, memory traces of painful events are retained.

George et al. (2008) investigated the role of the neurokinin-1 receptor,
a mediator of behavioral stress responses, in alcohol dependence
(103780) and treatment. In preclinical studies, mice genetically
deficient in NK1R showed a marked decrease in voluntary alcohol
consumption and had an increased sensitivity to the sedative effects of
alcohol. In a randomized controlled experimental study, George et al.
(2008) treated recently detoxified alcoholic inpatients with an NK1R
antagonist (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). The NK1R antagonist suppressed
spontaneous alcohol cravings, improved overall well-being, blunted
cravings induced by a challenge procedure, and attenuated concomitant
cortisol responses. Brain functional magnetic resonance imaging
responses to affective stimuli likewise suggested beneficial NK1R
antagonist effects. George et al. (2008) suggested that given these
surrogate markers of efficacy, NK1R antagonism warrants further
investigation as a treatment in alcoholism.

MAPPING

Hopkins et al. (1991) mapped the NK1R gene to chromosome 2, using PCR to
amplify the human sequence in hamster/human hybrid DNAs and also in
mouse/human monochromosome hybrids.

By analysis of mouse/human hybrid cell DNAs, Gerard et al. (1991) showed
that the NK1R gene is present in single copy and located on human
chromosome 2.

Peyrard-Janvid et al. (2004) linked the TACR1 gene to marker D2S286 on
chromosome 2p11. They excluded it as the cause of a form of dyslexia
mapping to that region (see 604254).

ANIMAL MODEL

De Felipe et al. (1998) disrupted the NK1 receptor gene in mice. Mutant
mice were healthy and fertile, but the characteristic amplification
('wind-up') and intensity coding of nociceptive reflexes were absent.
Although substance P did not mediate the signaling of acute pain or
hyperalgesia, it was essential for the full development of
stress-induced analgesia and for an aggressive response to territorial
challenge. De Felipe et al. (1998) suggested that substance P is
important for orchestrating the response of the animal to major
stressors such as pain, injury, or invasion of territory.

Toxin A, a 308,000-M(r) enterotoxin from Clostridium difficile, mediates
antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in humans. Injection of toxin
A into animal intestine triggers an acute inflammatory response
characterized by activation of sensory neurons and immune cells of the
intestinal lamina propria, including mast cells and macrophages, and
migration of circulating neutrophils in the involved intestinal segment.
Using mice deficient in NK1R, the substance P receptor, as a result of
targeted disruption of the gene in embryonic stem cells, Castagliuolo et
al. (1998) demonstrated protection from the secretory and inflammatory
changes of toxin A as well as from epithelial cell damage. The
protective effect correlated with diminished intestinal levels of
TNF-alpha (191160) and its mRNA and the leukocyte enzyme myeloperoxidase
(606989). The results demonstrated a major requirement for substance P
receptors in the pathogenesis of acute inflammatory diarrhea.

Modulation of substance P activity offers a radical new approach to the
management of depression, anxiety, and stress. The substance P receptor
is highly expressed in areas of the brain that are implicated in these
behaviors, but also in other areas, such as the nucleus accumbens, that
mediate the motivational properties of both natural rewards such as food
and of drugs of abuse such as opiates. Murtra et al. (2000) demonstrated
a loss of the rewarding properties of morphine in mice with a genetic
disruption of the substance P receptor, generated by De Felipe et al.
(1998). The loss was specific to morphine, as both groups of mice
responded when cocaine or food was used as a reward. The physical
response to opiate withdrawal was also reduced in substance P receptor
knockout mice. Murtra et al. (2000) concluded that substance P has an
important and specific role in mediating the motivational aspects of
opiates and may represent a pharmacologic route for the control of drug
abuse.

Murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 (gHV-68) shares sequence homology and
pathologic similarities with human Epstein-Barr virus and herpesvirus-8.
Elsawa et al. (2003) observed increased expression of substance P and
its receptor, Tacr1, in mucosal and lymphoid organs of wildtype mice
after intragastric inoculation with gHV-68. Tacr1-deficient mice showed
an increased viral burden and a reduced cytotoxic lymphocyte response
against gHV-68, as well as lower expression of Il12 mRNA and protein
during infection. Elsawa et al. (2003) concluded that elimination of
Tacr1 increases susceptibility to gHV-68.

Using immunohistochemistry, Svensson et al. (2005) detected increased
levels of substance P (SP; 162320) in vaginal tissue early after
infection of female mice with genital herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2. A
modest, but statistically significant, inhibitory effect of SP on HSV-2
infection was observed in vitro. Mice lacking the SP receptor, Nk1r,
showed enhanced viral replication, including in the central nervous
system, and reduced viral clearance associated with HSV-2 dose-dependent
accumulation of Mip1a (CCL3; 182283) and impaired local natural killer
cell function. Vaccination of Nk1r -/- and wildtype mice with an
attenuated HSV-2 strain showed that SP signaling was not required for
protection against HSV-2 challenge, and HSV-2-specific T cells secreting
Ifng (147570) were present in both Nk1r -/- and wildtype mice. Svensson
et al. (2005) concluded that HSV-2 infection induces SP expression in
vagina and that NK1R signaling contributes to innate resistance to
infection.

139250	TITLE *139250 GROWTH HORMONE 1; GH1
;;GH;;
GROWTH HORMONE, NORMAL; GHN;;
GROWTH HORMONE, PITUITARY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Growth hormone (GH) is synthesized by acidophilic or somatotropic cells
of the anterior pituitary gland. Human growth hormone has a molecular
mass of 22,005 and contains 191 amino acid residues with 2 disulfide
bridges (Niall et al., 1971).

CLONING

By 1977, not only had the amino acid sequence of GH been determined, but
the sequence of nucleotides in the structural gene for GH had been
determined as well (Baxter et al., 1977).

By molecular cloning of cDNA, Masuda et al. (1988) demonstrated that the
20-kD variant of human GH is produced by the same gene (GHN or GH1) as
the 22-kD form, and that a process of alternative splicing is involved.

Chen et al. (1989) sequenced the entire 66,500 bp of the GH gene
cluster. The expression of the 5 genes in this cluster was examined by
screening pituitary and placenta cDNA libraries, using gene-specific
oligonucleotides. According to this analysis, the GHN gene is
transcribed exclusively in the pituitary, whereas the other 4 genes
(CSL, 603515; CSA, 150200; GHV, 139240; and CSB, 118820) are expressed
only in placental tissues. The CSL gene carries a G-to-A transition in a
sequence used by the other 4 genes as an intronic 5-prime splice donor
site. The mutation results in a different splicing pattern and, hence,
in a novel sequence of the CSL gene mRNA and the deduced polypeptide.

GH and CSH (CSA) have 191 amino acid residues and show about 85%
homology in amino acid sequence (Owerbach et al., 1980). Their messenger
RNAs have more than 90% homology.

GENE FUNCTION

Human GH binds 2 GHR (600946) molecules and induces signal transduction
through receptor dimerization. Sundstrom et al. (1996) noted that at
high concentrations, GH acts as an antagonist because of a large
difference in affinities at the respective binding sites. This
antagonist action can be enhanced further by reducing binding in the
low-affinity binding site. A possible mechanism by which mutant,
biologically inactive GH may have its effect is to act as an antagonist
to the binding of normal GH to its receptor, GHR.

The regulation of GH synthesis and release is modulated by a family of
genes that include the transcription factors PROP1 (601538) and PIT1
(173110). PROP1 and PIT1 regulate differentiation of pituitary cells
into somatotrophs, which synthesize and release GH. Genes that are
important in the release of GH include the GHRH (139190) and GHRHR
(139191) genes. After GHRH is synthesized and released from the
hypothalamus, it travels to the anterior pituitary where it binds to
GHRHR, resulting in transduction of a signal into the somatotroph which
promotes release of presynthesized GH that is stored in secretory
granules. Other gene products that are important in GH synthesis and
release are GHR and the growth hormone-binding proteins (GHBP). The
GHBPs are derived from the membrane bound receptor (GHR) and they remain
bound to GH in the circulation. Following binding of GH to 2 GHR
molecules, the signal to produce IGF1 (147440) is transduced. The GH
molecules that are bound to membrane-anchored GH receptors can be
released into the circulation by excision of the extracellular portion
of the GHR molecules. At this point, the extracellular portion of the
GHR, which is referred to as the GHBP, serves to stabilize GH in the
circulation. The final genes in the GH synthetic pathway include IGF1
and its receptor (IGF1R; 147370), whose products stimulate growth in
various tissues including bones and muscle (Phillips, 1995; Rimoin and
Phillips, 1997).

Boguszewski et al. (1997) investigated the proportion of circulating
non-22-kD GH1 isoforms in prepubertal children with short stature
(height less than -2 SD score) of different etiologies. The study groups
consisted of 17 girls with Turner syndrome (TS), aged 3 to 13 years; 25
children born small for gestational age (SGA) without postnatal catch-up
growth, aged 3 to 13 years; and 24 children with idiopathic short
stature (ISS), aged 4 to 15 years. The results were compared with those
from 23 prepubertal healthy children of normal stature (height +/- 2 SD
score), aged 4 to 13 years. Serum non-22-kD GH levels, expressed as a
percentage of the total GH concentration, were determined by the 22-kD
GH exclusion assay. The median proportion of non-22-kD GH isoforms was
8.1% in normal children; it was increased in children born SGA (9.8%; P
= 0.05) and in girls with TS (9.9%; P = 0.01), but not in children with
ISS (8.9%). In children born SGA, the proportion of non-22-kD GH
isoforms directly correlated with different estimates of spontaneous GH
secretion and inversely correlated with height SD score. The authors
concluded that the ratio of non-22-kD GH isoforms in the circulation may
have important implications for normal and abnormal growth.

Mendlewicz et al. (1999) studied the contributions of genetic and
environmental factors in the regulation of the 24-hour GH secretion. The
24-hour profile of plasma GH was obtained at 15-minute intervals in 10
pairs of monozygotic and 9 pairs of dizygotic normal male twins, aged 16
to 34 years. A major genetic effect was evidenced on GH secretion during
wakefulness (heritability estimate of 0.74) and, to a lesser extent, on
the 24-hour GH secretion. Significant genetic influences were also
identified for slow-wave sleep and height. These results suggested that
human GH secretion in young adulthood is markedly dependent on genetic
factors.

Hindmarsh et al. (1999) studied GH secretory patterns in the elderly by
constructing 24-hour serum GH profiles in 45 male and 38 female
volunteers, aged 59.4 to 73.0 years, and related patterns to IGF1,
IGFBP3 (146732), and GH-binding protein levels; body mass index; and
waist/hip ratio. There was a highly significant difference in mean
24-hour serum GH concentrations in females compared to males as a result
of significantly higher trough GH levels in females. Peak values were
not significantly different. Serum IGF1 levels were significantly higher
in males. Peak GH values were related to serum IGF1 levels, whereas
trough GH levels were not. GH was secreted with a dominant periodicity
of 200 minutes in males and 280 minutes in females. GH secretion
assessed by ApEn was more disordered in females, and increasing disorder
was associated with lower IGF1 levels. Body mass index was negatively
related to GH in both sexes. In males, trough values were the major
determinant, whereas in females, the peak value was the major
determinant. Trough GH levels were inversely related in both sexes to
waist/hip ratio and to increasing secretory disorder. These data
demonstrated a sexually dimorphic pattern of GH secretion in the
elderly.

De Groof et al. (2002) evaluated the GH/IGF1 axis and the levels of
IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), IGFBP3 protease, glucose, insulin
(176730), and cytokines in 27 children with severe septic shock due to
meningococcal sepsis during the first 3 days after admission. The median
age was 22 months. Significant differences were found between
nonsurvivors and survivors for the levels of total IGF1, free IGF1,
IGFBP1 (146730), IGFBP3 protease activity, IL6 (147620), and TNFA
(191160). The pediatric risk of mortality score correlated significantly
with levels of IGFBP1, IGFBP3 protease activity, IL6, and TNFA and with
levels of total IGFI and free IGFI. Levels of GH and IGFBP1 were
extremely elevated in nonsurvivors, whereas total and free IGFI levels
were markedly decreased and were accompanied by high levels of the
cytokines IL6 and TNFA.

In rodents and humans there is a sexually dimorphic pattern of GH
secretion that influences the serum concentration of IGF1. Geary et al.
(2003) studied the plasma concentrations of IGF1, IGF2 (147470), IGFBP3,
and GH in cord blood taken from the offspring of 987 singleton Caucasian
pregnancies born at term and related these values to birth weight,
length, and head circumference. Cord plasma concentrations of IGF1,
IGF2, and IGFBP3 were influenced by factors related to birth size:
gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, maternal height, and
parity of the mother. Plasma GH concentrations were inversely related to
the plasma concentrations of IGF1 and IGFBP3; 10.2% of the variability
in cord plasma IGF1 concentration and 2.7% for IGFBP3 was explained by
sex of the offspring and parity. Birth weight, length, and head
circumference measurements were greater in males than females (P less
than 0.001). Mean cord plasma concentrations of IGF1 and IGFBP3 were
significantly lower in males than females. Cord plasma GH concentrations
were higher in males than females, but no difference was noted between
the sexes for IGF2. After adjustment for gestational age, parity, and
maternal height, cord plasma concentrations of IGF1 and IGFBP3 along
with sex explained 38.0% of the variability in birth weight, 25.0% in
birth length, and 22.7% in head circumference.

Ho et al. (2002) noted that the human GH gene cluster encompasses GHN,
which is expressed primarily in pituitary somatotropes, and 4 genes,
CSA, CSB, CSL, and GHV, which are expressed specifically in
syncytiotrophoblast cells lining the placental villi. A multicomponent
locus control region (LCR) is required for transcriptional activation in
both pituitary and placenta. In addition, 2 genes overlap with the GH
LCR: SCN4A (603967) on the 5-prime end and CD79B (147245) on the 3-prime
end. Ho et al. (2002) studied mice carrying an 87-kb human transgene
encompassing the GH LCR and most of the GH gene cluster. By deleting a
fragment of the transgene, they showed that a single determinant of the
human GH LCR located 14.5 kb 5-prime to the GHN promoter has a critical,
specific, and nonredundant role in facilitating promoter trans factor
binding and activating GHN transcription. Ho et al. (2002) found that
this same determinant plays an essential role in establishing a 32-kb
acetylated domain that encompasses the entire GH LCR and the contiguous
GHN promoter. These data supported a model for long-range gene
activation via LCR-mediated targeting and extensive spreading of core
histone acetylation.

Using mice carrying the 87-kb human GH transgene, Ho et al. (2006) found
that insertion of a Pol II terminator within the GH LCR blocked
transcription of the CD79B gene adjacent to the LCR and repressed GHN
expression. However, the insertion had little effect on acetylation
within the GH locus. Selective elimination of CD79B also repressed GHN
expression. Ho et al. (2006) concluded that Pol II tracking and histone
acetylation are not linked and that transcription, but not translation,
of the CD79B gene is required for GHN expression.

In addition to expression in pituitary and placenta and functions in
growth and reproduction, prolactin (PRL; 176760), GH, and placental
lactogen (CSH1; 150200) are expressed in endothelial cells and have
angiogenic effects. Ge et al. (2007) found that BMP1 (112264) and
BMP1-like proteinases processed PRL and GH in vitro and in vivo to
produce approximately 17-kD N-terminal fragments with antiangiogenic
activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

The GH, PL (CSH1), and PRL genes contain 5 exons separated by 4 introns.
The introns occur at the same sites, supporting evolutionary homology
(Baxter, 1981). All 5 genes in the GH gene cluster are in the same
transcriptional orientation (Ho et al., 2002).

Baxter (1981) found evidence for the existence of at least 3 GH and 3
CSH, also called placental lactogen (PL), genes on chromosome 17.
Whether they are situated GH:GH:GH:PL:PL:PL or arranged
GH:PL:GH:PL:GH:PL was not clear.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Sundstrom et al. (1996) crystallized a GH antagonist mutant, gly120 to
arg, with its receptor as a 1-to-1 complex and determined the crystal
structure at 2.9-angstrom resolution. The 1-to-1 complex with the
agonist is remarkably similar to the native GHR 1-to-2 complex. A
comparison between the 2 structures revealed only minimal differences in
the conformations of the hormone or its receptor in the 2 complexes.

EVOLUTION

Owerbach et al. (1980) estimated that the GH and CSH genes diverged
about 50 to 60 million years ago, whereas the PRL and GH genes diverged
about 400 million years ago.

Human PL and human GH are more alike than are rat GH and human GH. (PL
has more growth-promoting effects than milk-producing effects.) Baxter
(1981) proposed that in evolution the prolactin gene diverged early from
the gene that was the common progenitor of the GH and PL genes.
(Placental lactogen was the official Endocrine Society designation;
Grumbach (1981) promoted the term chorionic somatomammotropin, which has
functional legitimacy.)

MAPPING

By a combination of restriction mapping and somatic cell hybridization,
Owerbach et al. (1980) assigned genes for growth hormone, chorionic
somatomammotropin (CSH), and a third growth hormone-like gene (GH2;
139240) to the growth hormone gene cluster that is assigned to
chromosome 17.

Lebo (1980) corroborated the assignment of the GH gene to chromosome 17
by the technique of fluorescence-activated chromosome sorting. George et
al. (1981) assigned the genes for GH and CSH to the 17q21-qter region.

Ruddle (1982) found that the GH family of genes is between galactokinase
(604313) and thymidine kinase (TK1; 188300), with galactokinase being
closer to the centromere.

Harper et al. (1982) used in situ hybridization to assign the GH gene
cluster to 17q22-q24. A gene copy number experiment showed that both
genes are present in about 3 copies per haploid genome. The sequence of
genes in the GH gene cluster is thought to be GHN--CSL--CSA--GHV--CSB
(Phillips, 1983). Normal growth hormone (GHN, referred to now as GH1)
encodes GH. CSA and CSB both encode chorionic somatomammotropin. GHV, or
growth hormone variant, is now designated GH2.

Xu et al. (1988) assigned the growth hormone complex to 17q23-q24 by in
situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using GH cDNA as a specific DNA probe in Southern blot analyses,
Phillips et al. (1981) found that the GHN (GH1) gene was deleted in 2
families with type IA growth hormone deficiency (Illig type; 262400). On
the other hand, the GH genes of persons with type IB (612781) (in 6
families) had normal restriction patterns. Two affected sibs in 2 of the
6 families were discordant for 2 restriction markers closely linked to
the GH cluster.

Braga et al. (1986) reported the cases of a son and daughter of
first-cousin Italian parents who had isolated growth hormone deficiency
(IGHD) resulting from homozygosity for a 7.6-kb deletion within the GH
gene cluster. Both developed antibodies in response to treatment with
human GH, but in neither was there interference with growth. The
deletion affected not only the structural gene for GH (GH1) but also
sequences adjacent to CSL.

Goossens et al. (1986) described a double deletion in the GH gene
cluster in cases of inherited growth hormone deficiency. A total of
about 40 kb of DNA was absent due to 2 separate deletions flanking the
CSL gene (603515). Two affected sibs were homozygous. The parents were
'Romany of French origin' (i.e., French gypsies) and related as first
cousins once removed. Restriction patterns in them were consistent with
heterozygosity.

Vnencak-Jones et al. (1988) described the molecular basis of deletions
within the human GH gene cluster in 9 unrelated patients. Their results
suggested that the presence of highly repetitive DNA sequences flanking
the GH1 gene predisposed to unequal recombinant events through
chromosomal misalignment.

In a Chinese family, He et al. (1990) found that 2 sibs with GH
deficiency had a deletion of approximately 7.1 kb of DNA. The parents,
who were related as second cousins, were heterozygous but of normal
stature. The affected children had not received exogenous GH, but the
authors suspected that their disorder represented IGHD type IA.

Akinci et al. (1992) described a Turkish family in which 3 children had
IGHD type IA. A homozygous deletion of approximately 45 kb encompassing
the GH1, CSL, CSA, and GH2 genes was found. The end points of the
deletion lay within 2 regions of highly homologous DNA sequence situated
5-prime to the GH1 gene and 5-prime to the CSB gene. The parents, who
were consanguineous, were both heterozygous for the deletion.

Mullis et al. (1992) analyzed GH1 DNA from circulating lymphocytes of 78
subjects with severe IGHD. The subjects analyzed were broadly grouped
into 3 different populations: 32 north European, 22 Mediterranean, and
24 Turkish. Of the 78 patients, 10 showed a GH1 deletion; 8 had a 6.7-kb
deletion, and the remaining 2 had a 7.6-kb GH1 deletion. Five of the 10
subjects developed anti-hGH antibodies to hGH replacement followed by a
stunted growth response. Parental consanguinity was found in all
families, and heterozygosity for the corresponding deletion was present
in each parent. The proportion of deletion cases was about the same in
each of the 3 population groups.

Phillips and Cogan (1994) tabulated mutations found in the GH gene.

Takahashi et al. (1996) reported the case of a boy with short stature
and heterozygosity for a mutant GH gene (139250.0008). In this child,
the GH not only could not activate the GH receptor (GHR; 600946) but
also inhibited the action of wildtype GH because of its greater affinity
for GHR and GH-binding protein (GHBP), which is derived from the
extracellular domain of the GHR. Thus, a dominant-negative effect was
observed. See Kowarski syndrome, 262650.

Splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts is regulated by consensus sequences at
intron boundaries and the branch site. In vitro studies showed that the
small introns of some genes also require intron splice enhancers (ISE)
to modulate splice site selection. An autosomal dominant form of
isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD II; 173100) can be caused by
mutations in intron 3 (IVS3) of the GH1 gene that cause exon 3 skipping,
resulting in truncated GH1 gene products that prevent secretion of
normal GH. Some of these GH1 mutations are located 28 to 45 nucleotides
into IVS3 (which is 92 nucleotides long). McCarthy and Phillips (1998)
localized this ISE by quantitating the effects of deletions within IVS3
on skipping of exon 3. The importance of individual nucleotides to ISE
function was determined by analyzing the effects of point mutants and
additional deletions. The results showed that (1) an ISE with a
G(2)X(1-4)G(3) motif resides in IVS3 of the GH1 gene; (2) both runs of
Gs are required for ISE function; (3) a single copy of the ISE regulates
exon 3 skipping; and (4) ISE function can be modified by an adjacent AC
element. The findings revealed a new mechanism by which mutations can
cause inherited human endocrine disorders and suggested that (1) ISEs
may regulate splicing of transcripts of other genes, and (2) mutations
of these ISEs or of the transacting factors that bind them may cause
other genetic disorders.

Hasegawa et al. (2000) studied polymorphisms in the GH1 gene that were
associated with altered GH production. The subjects included 43
prepubertal short children with GHD without gross pituitary
abnormalities, 46 short children with normal GH secretion, and 294
normal adults. A polymorphism in intron 4 (A or T at nucleotide 1663,
designated P1) was identified. Two additional polymorphic sites (T or G
at nucleotide 218, designated P2, and G or T at nucleotide 439,
designated P3) in the promoter region of the GH1 gene were also
identified and matched with the P1 polymorphism (A or T, respectively)
in more than 90% of the subjects. P1, P2, and P3 were considered to be
associated with GH production. For example, the allele frequency of T at
P2 in prepubertal short children with GHD without gross pituitary
abnormalities (58%) was significantly different from that in short
children with normal GH secretion and normal adults (37% and 44%,
respectively). Furthermore, significant differences were observed in
maximal GH peaks in provocative tests, IGF1 (147440) SD scores, and
height SD scores in children with the T/T or G/G genotypes at P2. In the
entire study group, significant differences in IGF1 SD scores and height
SD scores were observed between the T/T and G/G genotypes at P2.
Hasegawa et al. (2000) concluded that GH secretion is partially
determined by polymorphisms in the GH1 gene, explaining some of the
variations in GH secretion and height.

Dennison et al. (2004) examined associations between common SNPs in the
GH1 gene and weight in infancy, adult bone mass and bone loss rates, and
circulating GH profiles. Genomic DNA was examined for 2 SNPs in the GH
gene, 1 in the promoter region and 1 in intron 4. Homozygotes at loci
GH1 A5157G and T6331A displayed low baseline bone density and
accelerated bone loss; there was also a significant (P = 0.04)
interaction among weight at 1 year, GH1 genotype, and bone loss rate.
There was a graded association between alleles and circulating GH
concentration among men. The authors concluded that common diversity in
the GH1 region predisposes to osteoporosis via effects on the level of
GH expression.

The proximal promoter region of the GH1 gene is highly polymorphic,
containing at least 15 SNPs. This variation is manifest in 40 different
haplotypes, the high diversity being explicable in terms of gene
conversion, recurrent mutation, and selection. Horan et al. (2003)
showed by functional analysis that 12 haplotypes were associated with a
significantly reduced level of reporter gene expression, whereas 10
haplotypes were associated with a significantly increased level. The
former tended to be more prevalent in the general population than the
latter (p less than 0.01), possibly as a consequence of selection.
Haplotype partitioning identified 6 SNPs as major determinants of GH1
gene expression, which is influenced by an LCR located between 14.5 and
32 kb upstream of the GH1 gene (Jones et al., 1995). Horan et al. (2003)
used a series of LCR-GH1 proximal promoter constructs to demonstrate
that the LCR enhanced proximal promoter activity by up to 2.8-fold
depending upon proximal promoter haplotype, and that the activity of a
given proximal promoter haplotype was also differentially enhanced by
different LCR haplotypes. The genetic basis of interindividual
differences in GH1 gene expression thus appeared to be extremely
complex.

Millar et al. (2003) sought to identify subtle mutations in the GH1
gene, which had been regarded as a comparatively rare cause of short
stature, in 3 groups: 41 individuals selected for short stature, reduced
height velocity, and bone age delay, 11 individuals with short stature
and IGHD, and 154 controls. Heterozygous mutations were identified in
all 3 groups but disproportionately in the individuals with short
stature, both with and without IGHD. Twenty-four novel GH1 gene lesions
were found. Fifteen novel GH1 gene mutations were considered to be of
probable phenotypic significance. Although most such lesions may be
insufficient on their own to account for the observed clinical
phenotype, they were considered likely to play a contributory role in
the etiology of short stature.

In a screen of the GH1 gene for mutations in a group of 74 children with
familial short stature, Lewis et al. (2004) identified 4 mutations, 2 of
which were novel: an ile179-to-met (I179M) substitution and a
single-basepair substitution in the promoter region. Resistance to
proteolysis and secretion from rat pituitary cells of I179M GH were
consistent with a lack of significant misfolding. Receptor binding
studies were normal, but molecular modeling studies suggested that the
I179M substitution might perturb interactions between GH and the GH
receptor loop containing residue trp169, thereby affecting signal
transduction. In contrast to its ability to activate STAT5 (601511)
normally, activation of ERK (see 176948) by the I179M variant was
reduced to half that observed with wildtype. The subject exhibited
normal GH secretion after pharmacologic stimulation. That the I179M
variant did not cosegregate with the short stature phenotype in the
family strongly suggested to Lewis et al. (2004) that this variant was
on its own insufficient to fully account for the observed clinical
phenotype.

Cogan et al. (1995, 1997) and Moseley et al. (2002) described 3
mutations (139250.0016; 139250.0011; 139250.0012) that are not located
at the 5-prime splice site in intron 3 but still alter splicing of GH1
to cause increased production of a 17.5-kD isoform. All 3 mutations
reside within purine-rich sequences that resemble exonic and intronic
splicing enhancers (ESE and ISE). Since splicing enhancers often
activate specific splice sites to facilitate exon definition, Ryther et
al. (2003) considered that the splicing defects caused by these
mutations could be due to a defect in exon definition, resulting in exon
skipping. They showed that overexpression of the dominant-negative
17.5-kD isoform also destroyed the majority of somatotrophs, leading to
anterior pituitary hypoplasia in transgenic mice. They demonstrated that
dual splicing enhancers are required to ensure exon 3 definition to
produce full-length 22-kD hormone. They also showed that splicing
enhancer mutations that weaken exon 3 recognition produce variable
amounts of the 17.5-kD isoform, a result that could potentially explain
the clinical variability observed in IGHD II. Noncanonical splicing
mutations that disrupt splicing enhancers, such as those represented by
the 3 mutations discussed, demonstrate the importance of enhancer
elements in regulating alternative splicing to prevent human disease.

Mullis et al. (2005) studied a total of 57 subjects with IGHD type II
(173100) belonging to 19 families with different splice site as well as
missense mutations within the GH1 gene. The subjects presenting with a
splice site mutation within the first 2 bp of intervening sequence 3
(5-prime IVS +1/+2 bp; 139250.0009) leading to a skipping of exon 3 were
more likely to present in the follow-up with other pituitary hormone
deficiencies. In addition, although the patients with missense mutations
had been reported to be less affected, a number of patients presenting
with a missense GH form showed some pituitary hormone impairment. The
development of multiple hormonal deficiencies is not age-dependent, and
there is a clear variability in onset, severity, and progression, even
within the same families. Mullis et al. (2005) concluded that the
message of clinical importance from these studies is that the pituitary
endocrine status of all such patients should continue to be monitored
closely over the years because further hormonal deficiencies may evolve
with time.

Shariat et al. (2008) studied a 4-generation family segregating
autosomal dominant growth hormone deficiency and identified a
heterozygous missense mutation in the GH gene (EX3+1G-A; 139250.0025) in
affected individuals. Analysis of the effects of this variant as well as
G-T and G-C changes at the first nucleotide of exon 3 illustrated the
multiple mechanisms by which changes in sequence can cause disease:
splice site mutations, splicing enhancer function, messenger RNA decay,
missense mutations, and nonsense mutations. The authors noted that for
IGHD II, only exon skipping leads to production of the dominant-negative
isoform, with increasing skipping correlating with increasing disease
severity.

Horan et al. (2006) observed an association between 4 core promoter
haplotypes in the GH1 gene and increased risk for hypertension and
stroke in a study of 111 hypertensive patients and 155 stroke patients.
The association was more significant for females than males. Horan et
al. (2006) also observed an association between an isoform of the GHR
gene lacking exon 3 (GHRd3) and hypertension in female stroke patients.
The authors postulated a complex interaction between variants in the GH1
and GHR genes involving height.

Giordano et al. (2008) studied the contribution to IGHD of genetic
variations in the GH1 gene regulatory regions. The T allele of a G-to-T
polymorphism at position -57 (dbSNP rs2005172), within the vitamin
D-responsive element, showed a positive significant association when
comparing patients with normal (P = 0.006) or short stature (P = 0.0011)
controls. The genotype -57TT showed an odds ratio of 2.93 (1.44-5.99)
and 2.99 (1.42-6.31), respectively. Giordano et al. (2008) concluded
that the common -57G-T polymorphism contributes to IGHD susceptibility,
indicating that it may have a multifactorial etiology.

ANIMAL MODEL

By Southern analysis of DNA from mouse-rat somatic cell hybrids, Cooke
et al. (1986) found that the GH gene is on rat chromosome 10 and the PRL
gene (176760) is on rat chromosome 17. Thus, in the rat, as in man,
these genes are on different chromosomes even though they show an
evolutionary relationship.

Morgan et al. (1987) showed that retrovirus-mediated gene transfer can
be used to introduce a recombinant human GH1 gene into cultured human
keratinocytes. The transduced keratinocytes secreted biologically active
GH into the culture medium. When grafted as an epithelial sheet onto
athymic mice, these cultured keratinocytes reconstituted a
normal-appearing epidermis from which, however, human growth hormone
could be extracted. Transduced epidermal cells may be a general vehicle
for the delivery of gene products by means of grafting.

Smith et al. (1997) demonstrated a role of GH in retinal
neovascularization, which is the major cause of untreatable blindness.
They found that retinal neovascularization was inhibited in transgenic
mice expressing a GH antagonist gene and in normal mice given an
inhibitor of GH secretion. In these mice retinal neovascularization was
inhibited in inverse proportion to serum levels of GH and IGF1.
Inhibition was reversed with exogenous IGF1 administration. GH
inhibition did not diminish hypoxia-stimulated retinal vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240) or VEGF receptor (VEGFR;
191306) expression. Smith et al. (1997) suggested that systemic
inhibition of GH or IGF1, or both, may have therapeutic potential in
preventing some forms of retinopathy.

Growth hormones from primates are unique in that they are able to bind
with and activate both primate and nonprimate GHRs, whereas GHs from
nonprimates are ineffective in primates. Behncken et al. (1997)
investigated the basis of primate specificity of binding by the GHR.
They examined the interaction between GHR residues arg43 (primate) or
leu43 (nonprimate) and their complementary hormone residues asp171
(primate) and his170 (nonprimate). They found that the interaction
between arg43 and his170/171 is sufficient to explain virtually all of
the primate species specificity.

In mouse preadipocytes, Wolfrum et al. (2003) found that Foxa2 (600288)
inhibited adipocyte differentiation by activating transcription of
preadipocyte factor-1 (DLK1; 176290), and that expression of both Foxa2
and Dlk1 was enhanced by growth hormone in primary preadipocytes.
Wolfrum et al. (2003) suggested that the antiadipogenic activity of
growth hormone is mediated by Foxa2.

Using GH-deficient Socs2 (605117) -/- mice, Greenhalgh et al. (2005)
demonstrated that the Socs2 -/- phenotype is dependent upon the presence
of endogenous GH. Treatment with exogenous GH induced excessive growth
in terms of overall body weight, body and bone lengths, and the weight
of internal organs and tissues. Microarray analysis on liver RNA
extracts after exogenous GH administration revealed a heightened
response to GH. The conserved C-terminal SOCS-box motif was essential
for all inhibitory function. SOCS2 was found to bind 2 phosphorylated
tyrosines on the GH receptor, and mutation analysis of these amino acids
showed that both were essential for SOCS2 function. Greenhalgh et al.
(2005) concluded that SOCS2 is a negative regulator of GH signaling.

GH1, 2-BP DEL, FS132TER

Igarashi et al. (1993) identified a Japanese patient with growth
retardation (IGHD IA; 262400) with a compound heterozygous pattern
consisting of total deletion of 1 GH1 gene and retention of a GH1 gene
of apparently normal size. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated deletion
of 2 bases of exon 3 of 1 GH1 allele of the mother and the patient. The
father carried a 6.7-kb deletion (139250.0003), present also on the
patient's paternal allele. The patient was a 13-year-old female, the
offspring of healthy, nonconsanguineous parents. GH therapy, begun at
the age of 9 years and 2 months, resulted in catch-up growth without
development of anti-GH antibodies. Deletion of the 2 bases in exon 3 was
predicted to introduce a termination codon after the codon of amino acid
residue 131 in exon 4.

In a Turkish family with IGHD IA (262400), Cogan et al. (1993) found a
G-to-A transition converting codon 20 from tryptophan (TGG) to stop
(TAG) in the signal peptide of GH1. The mutation resulted in termination
of translation after residue 19 of the signal peptide and no production
of mature GH. Patients homozygous for the mutation had no detectable GH
and produced anti-GH antibodies in response to exogenous GH treatment.

ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE IA
GH1, 6.7-KB DEL

Duquesnoy et al. (1990) described the cases of 2 sibs with IGHD IA
(262400) who were found to be compound heterozygotes for deletion and
frameshift mutations of the GH1 gene. Southern blot analysis showed them
to be heterozygous for a 6.7-kb GH deletion; DNA sequence analysis
demonstrated deletion of a cytosine at position 371, resulting in a
frameshift within the signal peptide coding region which prevented the
synthesis of any mature GH protein (139250.0004). The patients presented
with severe growth failure, and after an initial growth response to
treatment with exogenous GH, developed high titers of anti-GH
antibodies.

Vnencak-Jones et al. (1990) and Igarashi et al. (1993) also described
patients with 6.7-kb deletions deleting 1 GH1 allele.

In a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family with IGHD IB (612781), Cogan et
al. (1993) detected a G-to-C transversion of the first base of the donor
splice site of intron 4 as the basis of growth hormone deficiency. The
effect of this mutation on mRNA splicing was determined by transfecting
the mutant gene into cultured mammalian cells and DNA sequencing the
resulting GH cDNAs. Mutation was found to cause the activation of a
cryptic splice site 73 bases upstream of the exon 4 donor splice site.
The altered splicing resulted in loss of amino acids 103 to 126 of exon
4 and created a frameshift that altered the amino acids encoded by exon
5.

In another consanguineous Saudi family with IGHD IB (612781), Phillips
and Cogan (1994) found a mutation at the same nucleotide as that
described in 139250.0005. A G-to-T transversion in the first base of the
donor splice site of intron 4 had the same effect on splicing as the
G-to-C transversion. Patients homozygous for these 2 different defects
in 2 different families responded well to exogenous GH treatment and did
not develop anti-GH antibodies. Analogous splicing mutations occurred in
the beta-globin gene, causing milder forms of beta-thalassemia called
beta-plus-thalassemia.

Phillips and Cogan (1994) demonstrated a T-to-C transition in the sixth
base of the donor splice site of intron 3 in a Turkish family with IGHD
II (173100). The mutant GH gene was transfected into cultured mammalian
cells, and the GH mRNA transcripts were analyzed by direct sequencing of
their corresponding cDNAs. The mutation was found to inactivate the
donor splice site of intron 3, resulting in alternative use of the donor
splice site of intron 2 in conjunction with the acceptor site of intron
3. This alternative splicing pattern deleted or skipped exon 3,
resulting in the loss of amino acids 32 to 71 from the corresponding
mature GH protein products. All affected members of the family were
heterozygous for the mutation and had low but measurable GH levels after
stimulation. All responded well to treatment with exogenous GH. The
mechanism of the dominant-negative effect is unknown; the mutant GH
allele may inactivate the normal GH allele by formation of GH dimers or
disruption of normal intracellular protein transport.

KOWARSKI SYNDROME
GH1, ARG77CYS

Takahashi et al. (1996) reported a patient with short stature in whom
the bioactivity of growth hormone was below the normal range (Kowarski
syndrome; 262650). The patient was heterozygous for a C-to-T transition
in the GH1 gene that converted codon 77 from CGC (arg) to TGC (cys)
(R77C). Isoelectric focusing of the proband's serum revealed the
presence of an abnormal growth hormone peak in addition to the normal
peak. Further studies demonstrated that the child's growth hormone not
only could not activate the growth hormone receptor but also inhibited
the action of wildtype growth hormone because of its greater affinity
for growth hormone-binding protein and growth hormone receptor.

Petkovic et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for the R77C mutation
in a Syrian boy with short stature and partial GH insensitivity. His
mother and grandfather had the same mutation and showed partial GH
insensitivity with modest short stature. Functional analyses showed no
differences in the binding affinity or bioactivity between wildtype and
GH-R77C, nor were differences found in the extent of subcellular
localization within endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or secretory vesicles
between wildtype and GH-R77C. There was, however, a reduced capability
of GH-R477C to induce GHR/GHBP gene transcription rate when compared to
wildtype GH. Petkovic et al. (2007) concluded that reduced GHR/GHBP
expression might be a cause of the partial GH insensitivity with delay
in growth in this family.

GH1, IVS3, G-A, +1

Cogan et al. (1995) reported a G-to-A transition of the first base of
the donor splice site of intron 3 (+1G to A) in IGHD II (173100)
subjects from 3 unrelated kindreds from Sweden, North America, and South
Africa. This transition created an NlaIII site that was used to
demonstrate that all affected individuals in all 3 families were
heterozygous for the mutation. In expression studies the transition was
found to destroy the GH intron 3 donor splice site, causing skipping of
exon 3 and loss of amino acids 32 to 71 of the mature GH peptide from
the mutant GH mRNA. Microsatellite analysis indicated that the mutation
arose independently in each family. In 1 family, the finding that
neither grandparent had the mutation suggests that it arose de novo.

Hayashi et al. (1999) identified 2 mutations in Japanese patients with
IGHD II, G-to-A transitions at the first (mutA) and fifth (mutE;
139250.0014) nucleotides of intron 3. GH1 mRNAs skipping exon 3 were
transcribed from both mutant genes. The authors studied the synthesis
and secretion of GH encoded by the mutant GH1 genes and tested whether
inhibition of wildtype GH secretion by mutant products could be
demonstrated in cultured cell lines. A metabolic labeling study in COS-1
cells revealed that a mutant GH with a reduced molecular mass was
synthesized from the mutant mRNAs and retained in the cells for at least
6 hours. On the other hand, the wildtype GH was rapidly secreted into
the medium. Coexpression of mutant and wildtype GH did not result in any
inhibition of wildtype GH secretion in COS-1 or HepG2 cells. However,
coexpression of mutant GH resulted in significant inhibition of wildtype
GH secretion in somatotroph-derived MtT/S cells as well as in
adrenocorticotroph-derived AtT-20 cells, without affecting cell
viability. Hayashi et al. (1999) concluded that the dominant-negative
effect of mutant GH on the secretion of wildtype GH is at least in part
responsible for the pathogenesis of IGHD II. They also suggested that
neuroendocrine cell type-specific mechanisms, including intracellular
storage of the secretory proteins, are involved in the inhibition.

Saitoh et al. (1999) described a 1-year-old Japanese boy and his father
with IGHD II, both of whom had a G-to-A transition of the first base of
the donor splice site of intron 3 of the GH1 gene. The mutation occurred
de novo in the father. No unaffected family members had the mutation.

Binder and Ranke (1995) reported a G-to-C transversion of the first base
of the donor splice site of intron 3 (+1G to C) in a sporadic case of
IGHD II (173100) in a German patient. This mutation was dominant
negative and arose de novo. They also reported RT-PCR data suggesting
overexpression of the mutant GH1 allele and speculated that the
dominant-negative effect might occur because of this imbalance in
expression of the mutant and normal alleles. However, Binder et al.
(1996) found equal quantities of transcripts in studies using an RNA
protection assay to determine the relative expression of the intron 3 +1
G-to-C mutant and normal GH1 alleles. In normal pituitary, they found 3
GH1 mRNA species with the variant lacking exon 3, which comprised
approximately 5% of the total GH1 mRNA. In contrast, lymphoblasts from
the proband, who was heterozygous for the transition at intron 1,
contained equal amounts of mRNA with or without exon 3. Furthermore,
secreted GH1, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was present
in equal concentrations in media from normal and mutant cells. Thus, GH1
mRNA lacking exon 3 was expressed in proportion to the dosage of the
mutant gene, and dominant-negative effects on GH1 secretion were not
seen in lymphoblasts. Their findings are compatible with a
dominant-negative mechanism involving interaction between normal and
mutant proteins in secretory vesicles of somatotropes, as suggested by
Cogan et al. (1995).

GH1, IVS3, G-A, +28

Cogan et al. (1997) reported 2 intron 3 mutations in 2 unrelated
kindreds with autosomal dominant growth hormone deficiency (173100).
These mutations perturbed splicing and caused exon 3 skipping; however,
the mutations did not occur within the intron 3 branch consensus sites
or the 5-prime or 3-prime splice sites. Instead, these mutations
deranged sequences homologous to XGGG repeats that regulate alternative
mRNA splicing in other genes. Eukaryotic pre-mRNA splicing is regulated
by consensus sequences at the intron boundaries and branch site.
Sirand-Pugnet et al. (1995) demonstrated the importance of an additional
intronic sequence, an (A/U)GGG repeat in chicken beta-tropomyocin that
is a binding site for a protein required for spliceosome assembly. The
mutations found by Cogan et al. (1997) in the third intron of the GH
gene affected a putative, homologous consensus sequence and disturbed
splicing. The first mutation was a G-to-A transition base 28 of intron 3
and the second deleted 18 bp (del+28-45; 139250.0012) of intron 3 of the
human GH gene. The findings suggested that XGGG repeats may regulate
alternative splicing in the human growth hormone gene and that mutations
of these repeats cause growth hormone deficiency by perturbing
alternative splicing.

See 139250.0011 and Cogan et al. (1997). McCarthy and Phillips (1998)
presented evidence that this mutation and the G-to-A transition at
position +28 of IVS3 (139250.0011) disturb an intron splice enhancer
(ISE) that is critical for the proper splicing of transcripts of the GH1
gene.

KOWARSKI SYNDROME
GH1, ASP112GLY

In a child presenting with short stature, Takahashi et al. (1997)
demonstrated a biologically inactive growth hormone (262650) resulting
from a heterozygous single-base substitution (A to G) in exon 4 of the
GH1 gene. This change resulted in an asp112-to-gly amino acid
substitution. At age 3 years, the girl's height was 3.6 standard
deviations below the mean for age and sex. Bone age was delayed by 1.5
years. She had a prominent forehead and a hypoplastic nasal bridge with
normal body proportions. She showed lack of growth hormone action
despite high immunoassayable GH levels in serum and marked catch-up
growth to exogenous GH administration. Results of other studies were
compatible with the production of a bioinactive GH, which prevented
dimerization of the growth hormone receptor, a crucial step in GH signal
transduction.

In a father and his 2 daughters with autosomal dominant isolated growth
hormone deficiency (173100), Kamijo et al. (1999) found a G-to-A
transition at the fifth base of intron 3 of the GH1 gene. The paternal
grandparents did not show the mutation, indicating that it was a new
mutation in the case of the father. Kamijo et al. (1999) studied 2 other
(sporadic) cases of IGHD II. It is curious and undoubtedly significant
that so many mutations have been found in the splice donor site of IVS3
in cases of isolated growth hormone deficiency type II.

GH1, IVS4, G-C, +5

Abdul-Latif et al. (2000) identified an extended, highly inbred Bedouin
kindred with IGHD that clinically fulfilled the criteria for type IB
(612781). Molecular studies demonstrated a novel mutation in the GH1
gene: a G-to-C transversion of the fifth base of intron 4, which
appeared to cause GH deficiency through the use of a cryptic splice site
and, consequently, formation of a different protein. Clinical
observations suggested that apparently healthy, non-GH-deficient
individuals in this family were of relatively short stature. Leiberman
et al. (2000) correlated height measurements of potential heterozygotes
with carrier status for the newly identified mutation. Indeed, they
found that carriers of the mutant allele in heterozygous state had
significantly shorter stature than normal homozygotes. They found that
11 of 33 (33%) of heterozygotes, but only 1 of 17 (5.9%) of normal
homozygotes had their height at 2 or more standard deviations below the
mean. Overall, 48.5% of studied heterozygotes were found to be of
appreciably short stature with height at or lower than the 5th centile,
whereas only 5.9% of the normal homozygotes fell into that range (P less
than 0.004).

Moseley et al. (2002) reported an A-to-G transition of the fifth base of
exon 3 (exon 3+5A-G) in affected individuals from an IGHD II (173100)
family. This mutation disrupts a (GAA)n exon splice enhancer (ESE) motif
immediately following the weak IVS2 3-prime splice site. The mutation
also destroys a MboII site used to demonstrate heterozygosity in all
affected family members. To determine the effect of ESE mutations on GH
mRNA processing, GH3 cells were transfected with expression constructs
containing the normal ESE, +5A-G, or other ESE mutations, and cDNAs
derived from the resulting GH mRNAs were sequenced. All ESE mutations
studied reduced activation of the IVS2 3-prime splice site and caused
either partial exon 3 skipping, due to activation of an exon 3 +45
cryptic 3-prime splice site, or complete exon 3 skipping. Partial or
complete exon 3 skipping led to loss of the codons for amino acids 32-46
or 32-71, respectively, of the mature GH protein. They concluded that
the exon 3 +5A-G mutation causes IGHD II because it perturbs an ESE
required for GH splicing.

ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE II
GH1, EX3DEL

In affected members of a Japanese family with autosomal dominant
isolated growth hormone deficiency (173100), Takahashi et al. (2002)
found a heterozygous G-to-T transversion at the first 5-prime site
nucleotide of exon 3. Analysis of the GH1 cDNA, synthesized from
lymphoblasts of the patients, revealed an abnormally short transcript as
well as a normal-sized transcript. Direct sequencing of the abnormal
transcript showed that it completely lacked exon 3. In IGHD II, several
heterozygous mutations have been reported at the donor splice site in
intron 3 of the GH1 gene or inside intron 3 (e.g., 139250.0007,
139250.0009, 139250.0010), which cause aberrant growth hormone mRNA
splicing, resulting in the deletion of exon 3. Loss of exon 3 results in
lack of amino acid residues 32 to 71 in the mature growth hormone
protein. This mutant growth hormone exerts a dominant-negative effect on
the secretion of mature normal growth hormone protein. Thus, in the
family reported by Takahashi et al. (2002), the G-to-T transversion at
the first nucleotide resulted in deletion of exon 3 and caused growth
hormone deficiency. Takahashi et al. (2002) suggested that the first
nucleotide of exon 3 is critical for the splicing of GH1 mRNA.

Fofanova et al. (2003) studied mutations in 28 children from 26 families
with total IGHD living in Russia. They found 3 dominant-negative
mutations causing IGHD type II (173100): 1) an A-to-T transversion of
the second base of the 3-prime acceptor splice site of intron 2 (IVS2
-2A-T); 2) a T-to-C transition of the second base of the 5-prime donor
splice site of intron 3 (IVS3 +2T-C; 139250.0019); 3) and a G-to-A
transition of the first base of the 5-prime donor splice site of intron
3 (IVS3 +1G-A; 139250.0009). The IVS -2A-T mutation was the first
identified mutation in intron 2 of GH1. The authors concluded that the
5-prime donor splice site of intron 3 of GH1 is a mutation hotspot, and
the IVS3 +1G-A mutation can be considered to be a common molecular
defect in IGHD II in Russian patients.

KOWARSKI SYNDROME
GH1, CYS53SER

In a Serbian patient with short stature and bioinactive growth hormone
(Kowarski syndrome; 262650) Besson et al. (2005) detected a homozygous
cys53-to-ser (C53S) mutation in the GH1 gene. The mutation arose from a
G-to-C transversion at nucleotide position 705 (G705C). The
phenotypically normal first-cousin parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. This mutation was predicted to lead to the absence of the
disulfide bridge cys53 to cys165. In GH receptor (GHR; 600946) binding
and Jak2 (147796)/Stat5 (601511) activation experiments, Besson et al.
(2005) observed that at physiologic concentrations (3-50 ng/ml), both
GHR binding and Jak2/Stat5 signaling pathway activation were
significantly reduced in the mutant GH-C53S, compared with wildtype.
Higher concentrations (400 ng/ml) were required for this mutant to
elicit responses similar to wildtype GH. Besson et al. (2005) concluded
that the absence of the disulfide bridge cys53 to cys165 affects the
binding affinity of GH for the GHR and subsequently the potency of GH to
activate the Jak2/Stat5 signaling pathway.

In a 2-year-old child and her mother with severe growth failure at
diagnosis (IGHD II; 173100) (-5.8 and -6.9 SD score, respectively),
Vivenza et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous 22-bp deletion in IVS3
of the GH1 gene, designated IVS3del+56-77, removing the putative branch
point sequence (BPS). Both patients showed 2 principal mRNA species
approximately in equal amount, i.e., a full-length species encoded by
the normal allele, and an aberrant splicing product with the skipping of
exon 3 encoded by the mutant allele. Their clinical phenotype correlated
with that observed in other IGHD II patients harboring splice site
mutations.

GH1, ARG183HIS

In a large kindred with dominant growth hormone deficiency (IGHD II;
173100) Gertner et al. (1998) detected a heterozygous G-to-A transition
at nucleotide 6664 in exon 5 of the GH1 gene, resulting in an
arg183-to-his substitution (R183H).

Hess et al. (2007) studied the phenotype-genotype correlation of
subjects with IGHD II caused by a R183H mutation in the GH1 gene in 34
affected members of 2 large families. Twenty-four of the 52 members from
family 1 and 10 of the 14 from family 2 carried the same mutation in a
heterozygous state. The affected subjects in family 1 were significantly
shorter (-2.6 vs -0.1 standard deviation score (SDS), p less than
0.0001) and had significantly lower IGF1 (147440) serum levels (-1.9 vs
-0.5 SDS, p less than 0.0001), compared with family members with a
normal genotype. The affected adults exhibited great variability in
their stature, ranging from -4.5 to -1.0 SD (mean -2.8 SDS), with 5
members being of normal height (greater than -2 SDS). Twelve children
were diagnosed with IGHD. Two affected children had normal peak GH
levels, although 1 of these subsequently demonstrated GH insufficiency.
The affected children from both families exhibited large variability in
their height, growth velocity, delay in bone age, age at diagnosis, peak
GH response, and IGF1 levels. Hess et al. (2007) concluded that these
detailed phenotypic analyses show the variable expressivity of patients
bearing the R183H mutation, reflecting the spectrum of GH deficiency in
affected patients, even within families, and the presence of additional
genes modifying height determination.

ISOLATED GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY, TYPE II
GH1, EX3, A-C, +2

In 2 independent pedigrees with IGHD II (173100), Petkovic et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous splice enhancer mutation in exon 3, exon
3+2A-C, that encodes a glutamic acid-to-alanine change at position 32 in
the GH protein (E32A) and leads to missplicing at the mRNA level,
producing large amounts of the 17.5-kD GH isoform. Mouse pituitary cells
coexpressing both wildtype and mutant GH-E32A protein presented a
significant reduction in cell proliferation as well as GH production
after forskolin stimulation when compared with the cells expressing
wildtype GH. These results were complemented with confocal microscopy
analysis, which revealed a significant reduction of the GH-E32A-derived
isoform colocalized with secretory granules, compared with wildtype GH.
Petkovic et al. (2007) concluded that the GH-E32A mutation, which
occurred in the exon splice enhancer (ESE1), weakens recognition of exon
3 directly, and therefore increases production of the exon 3-skipped
17.5-kD GH isoform in relation to the 22-kD, wildtype GH isoform.

In affected members of a 4-generation family segregating autosomal
dominant growth hormone deficiency (173100), Shariat et al. (2008)
identified heterozygosity for a +1G-A transition in exon 3 of the GH
gene. The change was predicted to encode a glu32-to-lys (E32K)
substitution; however, transfection studies showed that when the mutant
was expressed, there was an approximately 6-fold increase in skipping of
exon 3 compared to wildtype (39% and 6%, respectively). Functional
analysis revealed that the variant weakens the 3-prime splice site and
simultaneously disrupts a splicing enhancer located within the first 7
bases of exon 3.

607988	TITLE *607988 SPARC/OSTEONECTIN, CWCV, AND KAZAL-LIKE DOMAINS PROTEOGLYCAN 2; SPOCK2
;;TESTICAN 2;;
KIAA0275
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteoglycans, which consist of a core protein and covalently linked
glycosaminoglycans, are components of the extracellular matrix. SPOCK2
encodes a member of a novel Ca(2+)-binding proteoglycan family (summary
by Vannahme et al., 1999).

CLONING

By screening an immature myeloid cell line for cDNAs with the potential
to encode large proteins, Nagase et al. (1996) identified a SPOCK2 cDNA,
which they called KIAA0275, encoding a protein with sequence similarity
to testican (SPOCK1; 602264) and with a thyroglobulin type-1 repeat.
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in brain, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By screening a human brain cDNA library with a fragment of an EST
showing sequence similarity to the follistatin-like domain of a
BM-40/SPARC/osteonectin (182120), Vannahme et al. (1999) cloned a SPOCK2
cDNA, which they called testican-2, encoding a deduced precursor protein
of 424 amino acids with a 22-amino acid signal peptide and a calculated
molecular mass of 46.8 kD. The mature 402-amino acid protein has 5
domains: a follistatin-like domain, a Ca(2+)-binding domain, a
thyroglobulin-like domain, and a C-terminal region with 2 putative
glycosaminoglycan attachment sites. The SPOCK2 protein shares 43%
overall sequence identity with SPOCK1. Northern blot analysis of adult
mouse tissues revealed expression of a major 6.1-kb transcript at high
levels in brain and at low levels in lung and testis. Minor bands of 4.4
and 2.6 kb were also detected. In situ hybridization demonstrated
widespread expression in multiple neuronal cell types in olfactory bulb,
cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebellum, pons, and medulla. A
recombinant fragment consisting of the Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand domain and
the thyroglobulin-like domain showed a reversible Ca(2+)-dependent
conformational change in circular dichroism studies.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the SPOCK2
gene to chromosome 10. By sequence analysis, Vannahme et al. (1999)
localized the gene to 10q21-q23.

613565	TITLE *613565 UBIQUITINATION FACTOR E4B; UBE4B
;;UFD2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, A; UFD2A;;
KIAA0684
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned UBE4B, which they designated
KIAA0684. The deduced 903-amino acid protein shares weak similarity with
Dictyostelium NOSA, a developmental regulator involved in proteasomal
degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (Koegl et al., 1999). See also
UBE4A, 603753. Using RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al. (1998) found uniformly high
KIAA0684 expression in all 10 human tissues examined. In vitro
translation resulted in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 92
kD by SDS-PAGE.

Kaneko et al. (2003) cloned mouse Ube4b, which they called Ufd2a, from
testis and T cell cDNA libraries. The deduced 1,174-amino acid protein
has a C-terminal U-box domain including a proline residue perfectly
conserved among U-box proteins. Western blot analysis detected Ufd2a at
an apparent molecular mass of 140 kD in most mouse tissues examined,
with highest abundance in cerebrum, cerebellum, and skeletal muscle.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed localization of Ufd2a in the
cytoplasm of cortical pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By expressing epitope-tagged mouse proteins in human embryonic kidney
cells, Kaneko et al. (2003) showed that Ufd2a interacted with Vcp
(601023), a AAA-family ATPase implicated in protein folding.

Using an in vitro ubiquitination assay with mouse and human UBE4B and
MDM2 (164785), Wu et al. (2011) showed that either UBE4B or MDM2 alone
led to monoubiquitination of the tumor suppressor p53 (TP53; 191170),
while UBE4B in combination with MDM2 promoted p53 polyubiquitination.
Reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays
revealed that UBE4B interacted directly with MDM2. Overexpression and
knockdown studies in mouse and human cell lines revealed that
interaction of UBE4B with MDM2 reduced the half-life of p53 via
proteasome-mediated degradation and caused repression of p53-dependent
transactivation and apoptosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krona et al. (2003) determined that the UBE4B gene contains 28 exons.

Kaneko et al. (2003) found that the mouse Ube4b gene contains 27 coding
exons. The promoter region has a CpG island that contains a functional
cis-acting element, but no TATA or CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the UBE4B
gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis, Krona et al. (2003)
mapped the UBE4B gene to chromosome 1p36.3-p36.2.

;;SNAP23A
SNAP23B;;
SNAP23C;;
SNAP23D;;
SNAP23E
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptosomal-associated proteins (SNAPs), such as SNAP23, are involved
in the process of membrane fusion in intracellular vesicle traffic
(Ravichandran et al., 1996).

CLONING

Ravichandran et al. (1996) used syntaxin-4 (186591) as bait in
expression cloning to isolate novel proteins involved in membrane fusion
in other cell types. From a human B-cell lymphocyte library, they
identified SNAP23, which shows homology to SNAP25 (600322). SNAP25 is
part of a complex, termed 'SNARE,' that is responsible for membrane
fusion in neurons. The SNAP23 cDNA encodes a 211-amino acid polypeptide
with a predicted mass of 23 kD. Its amino acid sequence is 59% identical
to that of SNAP25. Northern blot analysis revealed that SNAP23 is
ubiquitously expressed.

Mollinedo and Lazo (1997) used RT-PCR to identify an alternatively
spliced variant of SNAP23 in human neutrophils. This isoform, termed
SNAP23B, encodes a protein sequence of 158 amino acids with a deduced
mass of 17.8 kD. Lazo et al. (2001) determined that SNAP23B lacks a
region that is required for nonspecific binding to plasma membranes.

Shukla et al. (2001) identified 3 additional splice variants that they
designated SNAP23C, SNAP23D, and SNAP23E, all of which showed deletions
in comparison with SNAP23A. With use of variant-specific primers in
RT-PCR, they found mRNA for all 5 SNAP23 variants in human eosinophils,
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, neutrophils, brain tissue, and
basophilic and eosinophilic cell lines. Transfection of a basophilic
cell line with reporter constructs for each of these variants revealed a
plasma membrane localization for SNAPA and SNAPB, and both membrane and
intracellular localization for SNAP23C, SNAPD, and SNAP23E.

GENE FUNCTION

Ravichandran et al. (1996) determined that SNAP23 is able to bind to
multiple syntaxins as well as to multiple vesicle-associated membrane
proteins (see 185880).

Guo et al. (1998) reported that SNAP23 relocates in response to
stimulation from plasma membrane lamellipodia-like projections to
granule membranes in permeabilized mast cells. While relocation is a
prerequisite for secretion, it can occur without membrane fusion and
will expedite a subsequent secretory response. After relocation, SNAP23
is required for exocytosis, implying a crucial role in promoting
membrane fusion. Thus, relocation of SNAP23 regulates compound
exocytosis and links granule-plasma membrane and granule-granule
fusions.

Using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, Galli et al.
(1998) demonstrated that human TIVAMP (VAMP7; 300053), syntaxin-3
(STX3A; 600876), and SNAP23, were insensitive to proteolysis by numerous
clostridial neurotoxins (NTs). TIVAMP-containing vesicles were
concentrated in the apical domain of epithelial cells. STX3A and SNAP23
were codistributed at the apical plasma membrane, where they formed
N-ethyl maleimide-dependent SNARE complexes with TIVAMP and cellubrevin
(VAMP3; 603657). Galli et al. (1998) proposed that TIVAMP, STX3A, and
SNAP23 participate in exocytotic processes at the apical plasma membrane
of epithelial cells and in clostridial NT-resistant pathways.

Using RT-PCR, immunoblot analysis, and immunofluorescence microscopy,
Sander et al. (2008) demonstrated that human intestinal mast cells (MCs)
expressed SNAP23, STX1B (601485), STX2 (132350), STX3, STX4 (STX4A;
186591), and STX6 (603944), but not SNAP25. MCs also expressed VAMP3,
VAMP7, and VAMP8 (603177), but, in contrast with rodent MCs, they
expressed only low levels of VAMP2 (185881). VAMP7 and VAMP8
translocated to the plasma membrane and interacted with SNAP23 and STX4
upon activation. Inhibition of STX4, SNAP23, VAMP7, or VAMP8, but not
VAMP2 or VAMP3, resulted in markedly reduced high-affinity IgE
receptor-mediated histamine release. Sander et al. (2008) concluded that
human MCs express a specific pattern of SNAREs and that VAMP7 and VAMP8,
but not VAMP2, are required for rapid degranulation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lazo et al. (2001) found that the SNAP23 gene has 8 exons, with the
initiation codon located in exon 2. They determined that SNAP23B is the
result of alternative splicing where exon 5 is joined to exon 7,
skipping exon 6.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lazo et al. (2001) mapped the
SNAP23 gene to chromosome 15q21-q22. Lazo et al. (2001) suggested that
alterations in the SNAP23 gene may be involved in neurologic and other
diseases with defects in vesicle-membrane fusion processes that map to
15q15-q21.

176930	TITLE *176930 COAGULATION FACTOR II; F2
;;THROMBIN;;
PROTHROMBIN;;
FACTOR II
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The F2 gene encodes coagulation factor II (EC 3.4.21.5), or prothrombin,
a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein synthesized in the liver as an
inactive zymogen. Prothrombin is activated to the serine protease
thrombin by factor Xa (F10; 613872) in the presence of phospholipids,
calcium, and factor Va (F5; 612309). The activated thrombin enzyme plays
an important role in hemostasis and thrombosis: it converts fibrinogen
(134820) to fibrin for blood clot formation, stimulates platelet
aggregation, and activates coagulation factors V, VIII (F8; 300841), and
XIII (F13A1; 134570). Thrombin also inhibits coagulation by activating
protein C (PROC; 612283) (summary by Lancellotti and De Cristofaro,
2009).

CLONING

Degen and Davie (1987) determined the nucleotide sequence of the human
prothrombin gene, which encodes a 622-residue pre-propeptide with a
molecular mass of about 70 kD. The mature circulating protein has 579
residues. The prothrombin protein contains 5 domains: the propeptide
(residues -43 to -1), the Gla domain (residues 1 to 40), a kringle
domain (residues 41 to 155), a kringle-2 domain (residues 156 to 271),
and a serine protease domain (residues 272 to 579). The prothrombin
protein undergoes several cleavage events to generate the active enzyme
alpha-thrombin, which is composed of a light (alpha) and heavy (beta)
chain covalently linked by a disulfide bond (summary by Lancellotti and
De Cristofaro, 2009).

Degen et al. (1990) cloned cDNAs for mouse coagulation factor II and
compared the gene and predicted protein structure with that of human
prothrombin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Degen and Davie (1987) determined that the prothrombin gene contains 14
exons and spans about 21 kb. The gene contains 30 Alu repeats and 2 Kpn
repeats, which constitute about 40% of the gene.

MAPPING

Royle et al. (1987) assigned the gene for human prothrombin (F2) to
chromosome 11p11-q12 by analysis of a panel of somatic cell hybrid DNAs
and by in situ hybridization, using both cDNA and genomic probes.

Degen et al. (1990) mapped the mouse F2 gene to chromosome 2, about 1.8
map units proximal to the catalase locus.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Celikel et al. (2003) determined that the structure of platelet GP1BA
(606672) bound to thrombin at 2.3 angstrom resolution and defined 2
sites that bind to exosite II and exosite I of 2 distinct alpha-thrombin
molecules, respectively. GP1BA occupancy may be sequential, as the site
binding to alpha-thrombin exosite I appears to be cryptic in the
unoccupied receptor but exposed when a first thrombin molecule is bound
through exosite II. Celikel et al. (2003) suggested that these
interactions may modulate alpha-thrombin function by mediating GP1BA
clustering and cleavage of protease-activator receptors, which promote
platelet activation, while limiting fibrinogen clotting through blockade
of exosite I.

Dumas et al. (2003) independently determined the crystal structure of
the GP1BA-thrombin complex at 2.6 angstrom resolution. They found that
in the crystal lattice, the periodic arrangement of GP1BA-thrombin
complexes mirrors a scaffold that could serve as a driving force for
tight platelet adhesion.

Kroh et al. (2009) found that von Willebrand factor-binding protein
(VWFBP), which is secreted by Staphyloccocus aureus, is a potent
nonenzymatic conformational activator of prothrombin. VWFBP was found to
share homology with staphylocoagulase, another protein secreted by
Staphylococcus aureus that can activate prothrombin. However, the
mechanism of VWFBP activation of prothrombin was different from that of
staphylocoagulase, with VWFBP showing weaker affinity for prothrombin
and resulting in a slow conformational change with a specific need for
binding of the substrate fibrinogen to complete the process. The
findings suggested a unique mechanism for fibrin deposition during S.
aureus endocarditis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

- Congenital Prothrombin Deficiency and Dysprothrombinemia

Congenital prothrombin deficiency, also known as hypoprothrombinemia
(613679), is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe
bleeding manifestations and decreased prothrombin antigen levels and
activity to below 10% of normal values. Dysprothrombinemia, which is
characterized by normal antigen levels but a dysfunctional prothrombin
molecule, shows a more variable level in bleeding tendency, and there is
often a good correlation between the levels of prothrombin activity and
clinical severity. Akhavan et al. (2002) stated that 32 molecular
defects in prothrombin had been identified. Complete prothrombin
deficiency, or aprothombinemia, is believed to be incompatible with life
(review by Meeks and Abshire, 2008).

The allelic variants causing dysprothrombinemia are usually indicated
according to the city or area where they were described for the first
time: see, e.g., prothrombin Barcelona (176930.0002) and prothrombin
Tokushima (176930.0003). The abnormalities are usually caused by a
defect in activation of the protease, such as prothrombin Barcelona, or
a defect in the protease itself, such as prothrombin Quick (176930.0004;
176930.0005) and prothrombin Tokushima (reviews by Girolami et al., 1998
and Lancellotti and De Cristofaro, 2009).

- Thrombophilia

Poort et al. (1996) described a common genetic variation in the 3-prime
untranslated region of the prothrombin gene that is associated with
elevated plasma prothrombin levels and an increased risk of venous
thrombosis (THPH1; 188050): a 20210G-A transition (176930.0009) (Degen
and Davie, 1987). They found this single base substitution in 18% of
probands of thrombophilic families, 6% of unselected consecutive
patients with deep vein thrombosis, and 2% of healthy controls.
Rosendaal et al. (1997) found that the mutation was associated with a
4-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction in women, while among men
the risk was increased 1.5-fold (Doggen et al., 1998).

Martinelli et al. (1998) found that the 20210G-A mutation in the
prothrombin gene (176930.0009) and the factor V Leiden mutation
(612309.0001) are associated with 'idiopathic' cerebral vein thrombosis.
The use of oral contraceptives was also strongly and independently
associated with the disorder. The presence of both the prothrombin gene
mutation and oral contraceptive use raised the risk of cerebral vein
thrombosis further. The F2 and F5 mutations had previously been known to
be common genetic determinants of deep vein thrombosis of the lower
extremities. Cerebral vein thrombosis is a frightening event because of
the severity of the clinical manifestations and the high mortality rate,
estimated to be 5 to 30%. Clinically, cerebral vein thrombosis presents
with a wide range of symptoms, including headache, focal deficits (motor
or sensory), dysphasia, seizures, and impaired consciousness. The
findings of Martinelli et al. (1998) represent a prime example of the
interaction of endogenous (genetic) and exogenous factors in causation
of disease (Bertina and Rosendaal, 1998).

De Stefano et al. (1999) examined the relative risk of recurrent deep
venous thrombosis using a proportional-hazards model. The authors found
that while patients who were heterozygous for factor V Leiden had a risk
of recurrent deep venous thrombosis that was similar to that among
patients who had no known mutations in either factor II or factor V,
patients who were heterozygous for both factor V Leiden and prothrombin
20210G-A had a 2.6-fold higher risk of recurrent thrombosis than did
carriers of factor V Leiden alone.

The factor V Leiden mutation (612309.0001) and the 20210G-A mutation in
the prothrombin gene (176930.0009) are the most frequent abnormalities
associated with venous thromboembolism. Martinelli et al. (2000)
compared the prevalence and incidence rate of venous thromboembolism in
relatives with either of these 2 mutations or both. The study population
included 1,076 relatives of probands with the prothrombin gene mutation,
factor V Leiden, or both, who underwent screening for inherited
thrombophilia and were found to be carriers of single mutations or
double mutations or who were noncarriers. The prevalence of venous
thromboembolism was 5.7% in relatives with the prothrombin gene
mutation, 7.8% in those with factor V Leiden, 17.1% in those with both
mutations, and 2.5% in noncarriers. Annual incidences of thrombosis were
0.13%, 0.19%, 0.42%, and 0.066%, respectively. The relative risk of
thrombosis was 2 times higher in carriers of the prothrombin gene
mutation, 3 times higher in those with factor V Leiden, and 6 times
higher in double carriers than in noncarriers. The incidence of venous
thromboembolism in carriers of the prothrombin gene mutation was
slightly lower than that observed in carriers of factor V Leiden,
whereas in carriers of both mutations it was 2 or 3 times higher. From
these findings, Martinelli et al. (2000) concluded that lifelong primary
anticoagulant prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism is not needed in
asymptomatic carriers of single or double mutations. Anticoagulant
prophylaxis seems to be indicated only when transient risk factors for
thrombosis coexist with mutations.

In affected members of a Japanese family with recurrent thrombophilia,
Miyawaki et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous mutation in the F2 gene
(R596L; 176930.0015). The family had originally been reported by Sakai
et al. (2001). In vitro ELISA studies showed that the mutant prothrombin
did not form a complex with antithrombin (SERPINC1; 107300) even when
heparin was added. A thrombin generation assay showed that the mutant
prothrombin activity was lower than wildtype, but its inactivation in
reconstituted plasma was exceedingly slow. Miyawaki et al. (2012)
concluded that although the procoagulant activity of the R596L mutant
prothrombin was somewhat impaired, the antithrombin:thrombin complex was
considerably impaired, causing continued facilitation of coagulation.
The findings indicated that R596L was a gain-of-function mutation
resulting in the resistance to antithrombin, and conferring
susceptibility to thrombosis. The mutant variant was termed 'prothrombin
Yukuhashi.'

- Susceptibility to Recurrent Pregnancy Loss

Pihusch et al. (2001) studied clotting factors in 102 patients with 2 or
more consecutive spontaneous abortions (RPRGL2; 614390) compared to 128
women without miscarriage and found that heterozygosity for the 20210G-A
mutation of prothrombin (176930.0009) was more common in patients with
abortions in the first trimester (p = 0.027; odds ratio, 8.5). Noting
that in addition to fibrin generation, thrombin also activates tissue
components represented in the placenta and induces cellular responses,
Pihusch et al. (2001) suggested that increased prothrombin levels might
affect placental function by influencing pivotal mechanisms such as cell
adhesion, smooth muscle proliferation, and vasculogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Several observations suggest that prothrombin may serve a broader
physiologic role than simply stemming blood loss, including the
identification of multiple G protein-coupled, thrombin-activated
receptors, and the well-documented mitogenic activity of thrombin in in
vitro test systems. To explore further the physiologic roles of
prothrombin in vivo, Sun et al. (1998) generated prothrombin-deficient
mice by knockout techniques. Inactivation of the F2 gene led to partial
embryonic lethality with more than half of the F2 -/- embryos dying
between embryonic days 9.5 and 11.5. Bleeding into the yolk sac cavity
and varying degrees of tissue necrosis were observed in many of the F2
-/- embryos within this gestational time frame. At least one-quarter of
the F2 -/- mice survived to term, but they ultimately developed fatal
hemorrhagic events and died within a few days of birth. The study
demonstrated that F2 is important in maintaining vascular integrity
during development as well as in postnatal life.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PROTHROMBIN TYPE 3
F2, GLU157LYS

Board and Shaw (1983) showed that prothrombin type 3 is due to a
glu157-to-lys (E157K) substitution in the F2 gene. This was the first
identification of the specific change in a variant prothrombin, isolated
from individuals heterozygous for prothrombin type 3. This substitution
explained the relatively slow electrophoretic mobility of prothrombin
type 3 compared to wildtype at alkaline pH.

.0002
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, ARG271CYS

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Barcelona.

In a patient with normal prothrombin antigen levels, but low prothrombin
coagulant activity (see 613679) (Rabiet et al., 1979), Rabiet et al.
(1986) found that the defect was due to an arg271-to-cys (R271C)
substitution in the F2 gene. The peptide bond between arg271 and thr272
is one of 2 sites of cleavage by factor Xa, indicating that activation
of the variant Barcelona prothrombin protein to functional thrombin was
impaired.

.0003
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, ARG418TRP

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Tokushima.

In a 10-year-old Japanese girl who was compound heterozygous for
dysprothrombinemia (see 613679) and hypoprothrombinemia, Miyata et al.
(1987) identified a heterozygous 9490T-to-C transition in the F2 gene,
resulting in an arg418-to-trp (R418W) substitution on the maternal
allele. The patient had originally been reported by Inomoto et al.
(1987), who determined that the prothrombin variant showed about 22%
clotting activity and reduced platelet aggregating activity, suggesting
a defect in the catalytic region (Lancellotti and De Cristofaro, 2009).
Shirakami et al. (1983) and Shirakami and Kawauchi (1984) concluded from
study of this pedigree that the proband was a 'double heterozygote' for
a dysprothrombinemia variant (R418W), inherited from the mother, and a
hypoprothrombinemia (613679) variant, inherited from the father. Indeed,
Iwahana et al. (1992) determined that the hypoprothombinemia variant
inherited from the father was a 1-bp insertion (4177insT; 176930.0008).

.0004
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, ARG382CYS

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Quick I.

A patient with dysprothrombinemia (see 613679) originally studied by
Quick et al. (1955), Quick and Hussey (1962), and Owen et al. (1978) was
later found to be compound heterozygous for 2 defective alleles in the
F2 gene. Henriksen and Mann (1988) identified a heterozygous C-to-T
transition resulting in an arg382-to-cys (R382C) substitution, and
Henriksen and Mann (1989) identified a heterozygous G-to-T transversion
resulting in a gly558-to-val (G558V; 176930.0005) substitution. The
patient had less than 2% of normal prothrombin activity. Laboratory
studies by Henriksen and Mann (1988, 1989) showed that both variants
resulted in a structural change in the catalytic region causing
defective interaction with fibrinogen.

Banfield and MacGillivray (1992) found that the arginine residue at
codon 382 is conserved in 11 species ranging from the human to the gecko
(a lizard), the newt, and fish, including rainbow trout, sturgeon, and
the hagfish.

.0005
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, GLY558VAL

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Quick II.

See 176930.0004 and Henriksen and Mann (1989).

.0006
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, MET337THR

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Himi I.

In a girl with dysprothrombinemia (see 613679), Morishita et al. (1992)
found a congenitally dysfunctional form of prothrombin, called
prothrombin Himi, which was associated with reduced fibrinogen clotting
activity, although it retained full hydrolytic activity toward synthetic
substrates. Because previous findings suggested that the functional
defect of prothrombin Himi was caused by an abnormality in the thrombin
portion of the protein, Morishita et al. (1992) amplified the genomic
DNA regions corresponding to exons 8 through 14 and applied
single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Two variant conformers
in exon 10 were identified in the proband with this variant: an 8751T-C
transition resulting in a met337-to-thr (M337T) substitution inherited
from the father, and an 8904G-A transition resulting in an arg388-to-his
(R388H; 176930.0007) substitution inherited from the mother.

.0007
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA PROTHROMBIN HIMI-II
F2, ARG388HIS

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Himi II.

See 176930.0006 and Morishita et al. (1992).

.0008
HYPOPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, 1-BP INS, 4177T

In a Japanese girl who was compound heterozygous for hypoprothrombinemia
(613679) and dysprothrombinemia, Iwahana et al. (1992) demonstrated a
heterozygous 1-bp insertion (4177insT) in exon 6 of the F2 gene
inherited from her father. This defect was the basis of the
hypoprothrombinemia. The resulting frameshift mutation caused both an
altered amino acid sequence from codon 114 and a premature termination
codon (TGA) at codon 174 in exon 7. Because exon 7 encodes the kringle-2
domain preceding the thrombin sequence, the frameshift led to the null
prothrombin phenotype. The girl was compound heterozygous for 4177insT
and an R418W (176930.0003) substitution, which was the basis of the
dysprothrombinemia (see 613679).

THROMBOPHILIA DUE TO THROMBIN DEFECT

F2, 20210G-A

Rosendaal et al. (1998) presented data from 11 centers and 9 countries,
representing a total of 5,527 tested individuals. Among these, 111
heterozygous carriers of the 20210A mutation were found, yielding an
overall prevalence of 2.0%. In southern Europe, the prevalence was 3.0%,
nearly twice as high as the prevalence in northern Europe (1.7%). The
prothrombin variant appeared to be rare in individuals of Asian and
African descent.

To discern whether the 20210G-A polymorphism originated from a single or
recurrent mutation event, Zivelin et al. (1998) determined allele
frequencies of 4 dimorphisms spanning 16 of 21 kb of the factor II gene
in 133 unrelated Caucasian subjects of Jewish, Austrian, and French
origins who bore factor II 20210A (10 homozygotes and 123 heterozygotes)
and 110 Caucasian controls. Remarkable differences in the allele
frequencies for each dimorphism were observed between the study groups
(p = 0.0007 or less), indicating strong linkage disequilibrium and
suggesting a founder effect. Indeed, a founder haplotype was present in
68% of 20210A mutant alleles and in only 34% of 20210G normal alleles (p
less than 0.0001). These data strongly supported a single origin for the
factor II polymorphism. Because the polymorphism is rare or absent in
non-Caucasian populations, it probably occurred after divergence of
Africans from non-Africans and of Caucasoids from Mongoloid
subpopulations.

Rees et al. (1999) analyzed samples from 22 different non-European
countries and found that the prothrombin 20210G-A variant, like factor V
Leiden (612309.0001), is rare outside Europe. Of 1,811 non-Europeans
tested, they found only 1 individual, in India, who had the mutation in
heterozygous state.

Zivelin et al. (2006) analyzed the frequencies of 5 SNPs and 9
microsatellites flanking the prothrombin gene in 88 homozygotes for
20210A and 66 homozygotes for 20210G. For estimating the age of the
prothrombin 20210G-A mutation, they analyzed linkage disequilibrium
between the mutation and the multiple markers that had been assessed.
The analysis yielded an age estimate of 23,720 years. A similar analysis
was performed for factor V Leiden (612309.0001) yielding an age estimate
of 21,340 years. The occurrence of the 2 mutations in whites toward the
end of the last glaciation and their presently wide distribution in
whites suggested selective evolutionary advantages for which some
evidence was reported (diminished blood loss) or is controversial
(protection against infections). The selected disadvantage from
thrombosis is unlikely because until recent centuries humans did not
live long enough to manifest a meaningful incidence of thrombosis.

Thrombophilia

Poort et al. (1996) found that a common genetic 20210G-A transition in
the 3-prime untranslated region of the prothrombin gene (Degen and
Davie, 1987) was associated with elevated plasma prothrombin levels and
an increased risk of venous thrombosis (THPH1; 188050). The SNP was
found in 18% of probands of families with thrombosis, 6% of unselected
consecutive patients with deep vein thrombosis, and 2% of healthy
controls. Rosendaal et al. (1997) found that the mutation was associated
with a 4-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction in women, while
among men the risk was increased 1.5-fold (Doggen et al., 1998).

Franco et al. (1999) found a frequency of the 20210A allele of 1% in a
400-member healthy control population and 2.7% in 263 patients with
proven premature atherosclerotic disease. All heterozygotes in the
patient group were found to have had a myocardial infarction. In
addition, the data provided evidence for an association of the mutation
with excessive thrombin generation, which may contribute to the
understanding of its role in venous and arterial disease.

Chamouard et al. (1999) studied the frequency of the factor II 20210G-A
mutation in 10 white European patients with idiopathic portal vein
thrombosis. They studied 5 women and 5 men; mean age was 50.4 years. The
frequency of the 20210G-A mutation was found to be 40% in idiopathic
portal vein thrombosis compared with 4.8% in controls or patients with
nonidiopathic portal vein thrombosis or deep vein thrombosis. The
frequency of the factor V Leiden mutation (612309.0001) was similar in
subjects with portal vein thrombosis and in controls but was increased
in patients with deep vein thrombosis.

De Stefano et al. (1999) found that patients who were heterozygous for
both factor V Leiden (1691G-A; 612309.0001) and prothrombin 20210G-A had
a 2.6-fold higher risk of recurrent thrombosis than did carriers of
factor V Leiden alone. Patients who were heterozygous for factor V
Leiden had a risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis that was similar
to that among patients who had no known mutations in either factor II or
factor V.

In a Spanish family, Corral et al. (1999) identified 3 subjects
homozygous for the 20210A prothrombin mutation who additionally were
heterozygous for factor V Leiden. The combination of the 2 mutations
increased the risk of developing venous thrombotic episodes at an
earlier age. However, even in association with factor V Leiden, the
homozygous condition of the 20210A prothrombin mutation required
additional risk factors to induce a thrombotic event.

Humpert et al. (1999) screened 384 type 1 diabetic patients for the
20210G-A prothrombin polymorphism and detected the variant in 9
patients. There was no increase in the incidence of coronary heart
disease, nephropathy, or retinopathy among diabetic patients carrying
the 20210G-A polymorphism.

Meyer et al. (1999) described a method for simultaneously genotyping for
factor V Leiden and the prothrombin 20210G-A variant by a multiplex
PCR-SSCP assay on whole blood. Prohaska et al. (1999) studied 284
patients with angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease for the
presence of the 20210G-A polymorphism of the prothrombin gene and
compared them with 340 healthy controls. The prevalence of the mutation
was similar in both groups. There was a mild increase in the frequency
of the mutation in a group of 294 venous thrombosis patients compared
with the healthy controls (odds ratio, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.25-6.9).

One of the main factors of sudden hearing impairment, vestibular
disturbance (tinnitus), is generally thought to be an acute labyrinthine
ischemia; the most common mechanism of sudden hearing loss appears to be
impaired cochlear blood circulation. Mercier et al. (1999) provided
evidence that the 20210A allele of the prothrombin gene is a risk factor
for perception deafness. Among 368 patients (median age, 41 years) with
spontaneous deep vein thrombosis, 18 (12 women and 6 men, 38 to 69 years
of age) had also suffered from acute unilateral hearing impairment. Six
of the 18 were heterozygous for the 20210A allele. In a group of 395
nonthrombotic consecutive patients studied in the same laboratory for
hemorrhagic symptoms or thrombocytopenia over the same period of time, 4
had acute unilateral perception deafness; of 395 nonthrombotic and
nonhemorrhagic sex- and age-matched controls, 6 had acute unilateral
perception deafness.

Souto et al. (1999) reported a family illustrating the complexity of
thrombotic disease in relation to the 20210A variant. The pedigree was
ascertained through a proband with idiopathic thrombophilia. The family
members who had a history of thromboembolism were heterozygous carriers
of the 20210A variant. In addition, 4 relatives who were heterozygous as
well as 2 who were homozygous for the 20210A allele failed to show
clinical manifestations. The 2 homozygotes were 51 and 19 years old.

Gehring et al. (2001) demonstrated that the 20210G-A mutation does not
affect the amount of pre-mRNA, the site of 3-prime end cleavage, or the
length of poly(A) tail of the mature mRNA. Rather, Gehring et al. (2001)
demonstrated that the physiologic F2 3-prime end cleavage signal is
inefficient and that F2 20210G-A represents a gain-of-function mutation,
causing increased cleavage site recognition, increased 3-prime end
processing, and increased mRNA accumulation and protein synthesis.
Enhanced mRNA 3-prime end formation efficiency emerges as a novel
principle causing a genetic disorder and explains the role of the F2
20210G-A mutation in the pathogenesis of thrombophilia. Gehring et al.
(2001) concluded that their work illustrates the pathophysiologic
importance of quantitatively minor aberrations of RNA metabolism.

Although the 20210G-A mutation in heterozygous state carries an
increased risk of a first venous thromboembolic episode, De Stefano et
al. (2001) found that the risk of spontaneous recurrent venous
thromboembolism was similar to that in patients with normal genotype.
They concluded that carriers of the prothrombin mutation should be
treated with oral anticoagulants after a first deep venous thrombosis
for a similar length of time as patients with a normal genotype.

Laczika et al. (2002) described a 19-year-old woman with the joint
occurrence of type I antithrombin III deficiency (613118) and a
heterozygous prothrombin 20210G-A mutation, who developed chronic
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension on the basis of total occlusion of
the right pulmonary artery. Pulmonary vascular patency was restored
successfully by surgical pulmonary thromboendarterectomy performed 24
weeks after the initial clinical presentation.

Segal et al. (2009) provided a metaanalysis of the predictive value of
the prothrombin 20210G-A mutation for venous thromboembolism using a
literature review of 10 relevant articles. Although heterozygosity for
prothrombin 20210G-A in probands conferred a risk of 1.45, the
confidence interval ranged from 0.96 to 2.2, suggesting that the
mutation was not predictive of recurrent venous thromboembolism compared
to those without the mutation. In addition, there was insufficient
evidence regarding the predictive value of homozygosity for prothrombin
20210G-A in probands, and for the predictive value of being a mutation
carrier in relatives of probands with the mutation. It remained unknown
whether testing improved clinical outcomes. Segal et al. (2009)
concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis
that 20210G-A confers a significantly increased risk for venous
thromboembolism in terms of genetic testing.

Ischemic Stroke

In a comprehensive metaanalysis of 19 case-control studies including
3,028 white adult patients, Casas et al. (2004) found a statistically
significant association between ischemic stroke (601367) and the
20210G-A substitution (odds ratio of 1.44).

Budd-Chiari Syndrome

In a 37-year-old Caucasian male with polycythemia vera who had developed
Budd-Chiari syndrome (BDCHS; 600880), Bucciarelli et al. (1998)
identified heterozygosity for the 20210G-A substitution. His paternal
grandmother had died at the age of 60 due to BDCHS, and his father, who
was also heterozygous for the mutation, had had a myocardial infarction
at age 55. Bucciarelli et al. (1998) excluded deficiencies of
antithrombin, protein C, and protein S, as well as the presence of
antiphospholipid syndrome and the factor V Leiden mutation. They
suggested case-control studies to establish if carriers of the 20210G-A
mutation have an increased risk of developing BDCHS.

Oner et al. (1999) described Budd-Chiari syndrome in a patient
heterozygous for both the 20210G-A mutation of F2 and the factor V
Leiden mutation; heterozygosity for the factor V Leiden mutation is a
known susceptibility factor for BDCHS. Oner et al. (1999) referred to
the 20210G-A mutation by the abbreviation PM, presumably for
'prothrombin mutation.'

Susceptibility to Recurrent Pregnancy Loss

Pihusch et al. (2001) studied clotting factors in 102 patients with 2 or
more consecutive spontaneous abortions (RPRGL2; 614390) compared to 128
women without miscarriage and found that heterozygosity for the 20210G-A
mutation of prothrombin was more common in patients with abortions in
the first trimester (p = 0.027; odds ratio, 8.5).

DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, GLU300LYS

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Denver I.

Montgomery et al. (1980) described a form of dysprothrombinemia (see
613679) in a proband with a severe hemophilia-like bleeding disorder who
was treated with weekly prophylactic prothrombin replacement. Lefkowitz
et al. (2000) found that the patient was a compound heterozygote for 2
mutations in the F2 gene: glu300-to-lys (E300K) and glu309-to-lys
(E309K; 176930.0011). Factor II activity was 5 units/dl and factor II
antigen was 21 units/dl. The functional defect was apparently in the
activation of zymogen to enzyme.

.0011
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA

.0012
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, ARG382HIS

Akhavan et al. (2000) described a homozygous arg382-to-his (R382H)
substitution in the prothrombin gene of an Iranian girl with
dysprothrombinemia (see 613679). The only symptoms were sporadic
ecchymosis and 1 episode of buttock hematoma following a major trauma. A
substitution in this residue had been identified in the compound
heterozygous dysprothrombins Quick I (R382C; 176930.0004) and Corpus
Christi.

Akhavan et al. (2002) investigated the functional properties of the
R382H mutant protein. Their experiments showed that the R382H
substitution drastically affected both the procoagulant and the
anticoagulant functions of thrombin as well as its inhibition by heparin
cofactor II (142360). The mild hemorrhagic phenotype may be explained by
abnormalities that ultimately counterbalance each other.

.0013
DYSPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, ASP552GLU

This F2 variant is referred to as prothrombin Saint-Denis.

In a male newborn with dysprothrombinemia (see 613679), Rouy et al.
(2006) identified a new prothrombin variant, with a point mutation at
nucleotide 20029 resulting in an asp552-to-glu (D552E) substitution.
Prothrombin levels were reduced in each of 3 assays. The substitution
did not affect the rate of prothrombin conversion to thrombin, but
altered thrombin activity. Amino acid 552 had been involved in the
allosteric transition, which is induced by sodium binding to thrombin.
This was the first known amino acid substitution at this site to result
in dysprothrombinemia. The male newborn was referred because of fetal
pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular failure, which resolved
spontaneously. The father and mother, who were first cousins, had a
slight decrease in prothrombin activity and normal levels of prothrombin
antigen. No abnormal bleeding was observed in the proband at birth or in
the first 30 months of his life, and both parents were asymptomatic.

.0014
HYPOPROTHROMBINEMIA
F2, TYR44CYS

In a patient with congenital prothrombin deficiency (613679) and severe
bleeding tendency, Poort et al. (1994) identified a homozygous A-to-G
transition in exon 3 of the F2 gene, resulting in a tyr44-to-cys (Y44C)
substitution. Laboratory studies showed factor II activity at about 2%
and antigen levels at about 5%. Both parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. Further family studies revealed complete cosegregation of the
mutation with the prothrombin deficiency. Five homozygous brothers and
sisters of the propositus were clinically affected with severe
hemorrhages, including epistaxis, soft tissue, muscle, and joint
bleedings in all, and severe menorrhagia in the 2 women.

Lancellotti and De Cristofaro (2009) noted that the Y44C mutation
resulted from a 1305A-G change and affected the kringle-1 domain. The
mutation was found in the family with hypoprothrombinemia reported by
Van Creveld (1954).

.0015
THROMBOPHILIA DUE TO THROMBIN DEFECT
F2, ARG596LEU

In affected members of a Japanese family with recurrent thrombophilia
due to thrombin defect (188050), Miyawaki et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 1787G-T transversion in the F2 gene, resulting in an
arg596-to-leu (R596L) substitution within the sodium-binding region of
thrombin and also in 1 of the antithrombin-binding sites. The mutation
was not found in unaffected family members or in 100 control
individuals. In vitro ELISA studies showed that the mutant prothrombin
did not form a complex with antithrombin (SERPINC1; 107300) even when
heparin was added. A thrombin generation assay showed that the mutant
prothrombin activity was lower than wildtype, but its inactivation in
reconstituted plasma was exceedingly slow. Miyawaki et al. (2012)
concluded that although the procoagulant activity of mutant prothrombin
was somewhat impaired due to disruption of the sodium-binding site, the
antithrombin:thrombin complex was considerably impaired due to
disruption of that binding site, causing continued facilitation of
coagulation. The findings indicated that R596L was a gain-of-function
mutation resulting in the resistance to antithrombin, and conferring
susceptibility to thrombosis. The mutant variant was termed 'prothrombin
Yukuhashi.'

607581	TITLE *607581 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 8; SLC22A8
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 3; OAT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using homology with rat Oat1 (SLC22A6; 607582), Race et al. (1999)
identified ESTs for SLC22A8, which they designated OAT3. They obtained
the full-length clone from a kidney cDNA library. The deduced 568-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 62.1 kD. SLC22A8
contains 12 transmembrane-spanning domains that are separated by 5
intracellular loops and 6 extracellular loops, and the N and C termini
are intracellular. It also has 3 motifs conserved in the amphiphilic
solute facilitator family of proteins. SLC22A8 shares 42 to 43% amino
acid similarity with human, mouse, and rat OAT1 and 25% similarity with
the organic cation transporters OCT1 (SLC22A1; 602607) and OCT2
(SLC22A2; 602608). Northern blot analysis revealed strong expression of
a 3.0-kb transcript in kidney, with weaker expression in brain.

By screening liver and kidney cDNA libraries for homology with rat Oat1,
Sun et al. (2001) cloned what they considered to be a splice variant of
the OAT3 sequence reported by Race et al. (1999). The deduced protein
contains 542 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected expression of
a major 2.6-kb OAT3 transcript and a minor 4.5-kb OAT3 transcript only
in kidney.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SLC22A8
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-14966).

601746	TITLE *601746 HYPOXIA UP-REGULATED 1; HYOU1
;;OXYGEN-REGULATED PROTEIN, 150-KD; ORP150
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Astrocytes retain cell viability, even in extreme ischemia, and
proliferate in damaged brain (Petito et al., 1990; Janeczko, 1991). Rat
astrocytes exposed to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation were reported to
release increased amounts of interleukin-6 (147620) that could promote
neuronal survival in ischemic brain (Maeda et al., 1994). Kuwabara et
al. (1996) observed a 150-kD protein, called oxygen-regulated protein
(ORP150) by them, in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cultured
astrocytes that was induced specifically by hypoxia and not by other
stimuli.

Ikeda et al. (1997) reported the cloning of human and rat ORP150 cDNAs
from hypoxia-treated human astrocytoma U373 cells and rat astrocytes,
respectively. The full-length 4,503-bp human cDNA contains a 2,997-bp
open reading frame predicted to encode a polypeptide of 999 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 111,330 Da. The deduced amino acid
sequences of human and rat ORP150 exhibit high similarity (over 90%
identity) to each other. The first 32 residues represent the signal
peptide necessary for secretion. The C-terminal KNDEL sequence resembles
KDEL, a motif found in ER-resident proteins, suggesting that ORP150
resides in the ER. The N-terminal half of ORP150 has a modest similarity
to the ATPase domain of numerous HSP70 family sequences (see 140550).
Northern blot analysis revealed a marked similarity of expression
between ORP150 and GRP78 (138120) in U373 cells during hypoxia stress.
(The GRP78 protein is produced in cultured rat astrocytes exposed to
hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation.) They also found that ORP150 mRNA was
highly expressed in the liver and pancreas, whereas little expression
was observed in the kidney and brain, similarly to the expression
pattern of GRP78. Ikeda et al. (1997) proposed that ORP150 plays an
important role in protein folding and secretion in the ER, perhaps as a
molecular chaperone in concert with other GRPs, to cope with
environmental stress.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HYOU1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP stSG31085).

GENE FUNCTION

Tamatani et al. (2001) found that although ORP150 was sparingly
upregulated in neurons from human brain undergoing ischemic stress,
there was robust induction in astrocytes. Cultured neurons
overexpressing ORP150 were resistant to hypoxemic stress, whereas
astrocytes with inhibited ORP150 expression were more vulnerable. Mice
with targeted neuronal overexpression of ORP150 had smaller strokes
compared with controls. Neurons with increased ORP150 demonstrated
suppressed caspase-3-like activity and enhanced brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (113505) under hypoxia signaling. Tamatani et
al. (2001) concluded that ORP150 is an integral participant in ischemic
cytoprotective pathways.

Ozawa et al. (2001) demonstrated coexpression, colocalization, and
coimmunoprecipitation of ORP150 and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; 192240) in the ER of macrophages within the neovasculature of
human wound granulation tissue. In vitro, inhibition of ORP150 resulted
in retention of VEGF within the ER, whereas overexpression of ORP150
promoted the secretion of VEGF into hypoxic culture supernatants,
indicating that ORP150 may participate in VEGF transport to the
cytoplasm. In wounds of diabetic mice, overexpression of ORP150 resulted
in accelerated repair and closure; suppression of ORP150 delayed repair.
Ozawa et al. (2001) concluded that ORP150 plays a role in the promotion
of angiogenesis, and more generally acts as a molecular chaperone under
hypoxic conditions to facilitate protein transport and processing in the
ER.

Two members of the HSP70 family are required for protein biogenesis in
the yeast endoplasmic reticulum: Lhs1 (homologous to HYOU1) and Kar2
(homologous to HSPA5, or BiP; 138120). Steel et al. (2004) found that
Lhs1 and Kar2 specifically interacted to couple, and coordinately
regulate, their respective activities. Lhs1 stimulated Kar2 by providing
a specific nucleotide exchange activity, whereas Kar2 reciprocally
activated the Lhs1 ATPase. In yeast, the 2 ATPase activities are
coupled, and their coordinated regulation is essential for normal
function in vivo.

Zhao et al. (2010) showed that overexpression of Hyou1 prevented ER
stress and rescued neurodegeneration of Purkinje cells in Sil1 (608005)
-/- mice, whereas decreasing expression of Hyou1 exacerbated these
phenotypes. Purkinje cells from the caudal lobules of the cerebellum
from Sil1 -/- mice typically do not show signs of ER stress; however,
decreased expression of Hyou1 in these cells resulted in signs of ER
stress, ubiquitin-positive inclusions, and death. Zhao et al. (2010)
suggested that HYOU1 and SIL1 have partially redundant functions as BiP
nucleotide exchange factors in Purkinje cells.

614888	TITLE *614888 ALPHA- AND GAMMA-ADAPTIN-BINDING PROTEIN; AAGAB
;;p34
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP1 and AP2 are heterotetrameric complexes involved in clathrin-coated
vesicle trafficking that associate with the trans-Golgi network (TGN)
and plasma membrane, respectively. AAGAB, or p34, interacts with the
gamma-adaptin (AP1G1; 603533) subunit of AP1 and with the alpha-adaptin
(AP2A1; 601026) subunit of AP2 (Page et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using mouse gamma-adaptin in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA
library, Page et al. (1999) cloned Aagab, which they called p34. The
deduced protein contains 315 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected variable Aagab expression in all rat tissues examined.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 15 linked to punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma type I (PPKP1A; 148600), followed by PCR of a
human keratinocyte cDNA library, Giehl et al. (2012) cloned full-length
AAGAB. RT-PCR analysis detected AAGAB expression in hair follicle cells,
skin, HaCaT keratinocytes, and lymphocytes, with highest relative
expression in HaCaT cells. Database analysis suggested ubiquitous AAGAB
expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal palmoplantar skin
detected granular cytoplasmic AAGAB staining, particularly in the
stratum basale and the first suprabasal cell layers of the stratum
spinosum. Much weaker staining was detected in upper layers of the
stratum spinosum, where it localized only around nuclei in a few
keratinocytes. Dermal vessels were also AAGAB positive.

Independently, Pohler et al. (2012) cloned AAGAB by RT-PCR of HaCaT cell
total RNA. The deduced 315-amino acid protein contains a RAB (see
179508)-like GTPase domain in its N-terminal half and an adaptin-binding
domain in its C-terminal half. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed
AAGAB expression in all 48 human tissues examined, with highest
expression in rectum and thymus, followed by adrenal gland, spleen,
uterus, and vagina. Lowest expression was detected in mammary gland.
Fluorescence-tagged AAGAB was expressed in cytosol, but not in membrane
or clathrin-coated vesicle fractions, of HaCaT and HeLa cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Independently, Giehl et al. (2012) and Pohler et al. (2012) determined
that the AAGAB gene contains 10 exons. Pohler et al. (2012) reported
that the AAGAB gene spans 53.7 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Giehl et al. (2012) mapped the AAGAB gene
to chromosome 15q22.33-q23.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Page et al. (1999) found that rat p34
interacted with mouse gamma-adaptin and alpha-adaptin.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis and Western blot analysis, Pohler et
al. (2012) confirmed that p34 interacted with both AP1 and AP2
complexes. Knockdown of p34 did not alter the TNG or plasma membrane
localization of AP1 or AP2, respectively. In HaCaT cells, knockdown of
AAGAB increased EGFR (131550) mRNA levels and EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation, indicative of active EGFR signaling. Pohler et al.
(2012) concluded that AAGAB may have a role in regulating EGFR turnover,
possibly via ATPase activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 families with type I punctate palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1;
148600), Giehl et al. (2012) identified 2 heterozygous nonsense
mutations in the AAGAB gene, R161X (614888.0001) and R124X
(614888.0002), that segregated fully with disease in the respective
families. Immunofluorescence analyses of skin from the palms and soles
of affected individuals revealed that the amount of granular staining in
keratinocytes was lower in the cytoplasm but higher around the nucleus
than in keratinocytes from controls, suggesting clumping of defective
keratin molecules.

In a collection of 18 PPKP1 kindreds from Scotland, Ireland, Japan, and
Tunisia, 11 of which had a family history consistent with autosomal
dominant inheritance, Pohler et al. (2012) identified heterozygous
mutations in the AAGAB gene (see, e.g., 614888.0001 and
614888.0003-614888.0006).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, ARG161TER

In affected members of 2 Croatian families with type I punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Giehl et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a 481C-T transition in exon 5 of the AAGAB
gene, resulting in an arg161-to-ter (R161X) substitution. The mutation
was not found in unaffected family members. Genotyping of 21 individuals
from the 2 families revealed a 1.2-Mb common haplotype between markers
SNP15-67469128 and SNP15-68728632, indicating that the affected
individuals inherited the mutation by descent from a common ancestor.
Immunoblot analysis confirmed the predicted truncated size of
approximately 24 kD for R161X and showed a strong band, suggesting that
the protein is stable and not degraded. Allele-specific PCR
amplification yielded only a very small peak for the 481C-T allele.

In a 4-generation Scottish family with PPKP, Pohler et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for the R161X mutation, which segregated with
disease in the family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes
databases.

.0002
KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, ARG124TER

In affected members of a German family with type I punctate palmoplantar
keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Giehl et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a 370C-T transition in exon 4 of the AAGAB gene,
resulting in an arg124-to-ter (R124X) substitution. The mutation was not
found in unaffected family members. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the
predicted truncated size of approximately 18 kD for R124X but showed
only a faint band, suggesting that the corresponding mRNA is prone to
decay. Allele-specific PCR amplification yielded undetectable results
for the 370C-T allele, indicating loss of the protein.

.0003
KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, 2-BP DEL, 348AG

In affected members of 3 Tunisian families with type I punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), 1 of which was originally
reported by El Amri et al. (2010), Pohler et al. (2012) identified
heterozygosity for a 2-bp deletion (348_349delAG) in the AAGAB gene,
predicted to cause a frameshift within the GTPase domain resulting in a
premature termination codon (R116Sfs*1).

.0004
KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, 1-BP DEL, NT473

In affected members of 5 Scottish families with type I punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Pohler et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (473del) in the AAGAB
gene, predicted to cause a frameshift resulting in a premature
termination codon (Gly158Glufs*0).

.0005
KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, 4-BP DEL, NT200

In affected members of 2 Japanese families with type I punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Pohler et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (200_203del) in the AAGAB
gene, predicted to cause a frameshift resulting in a premature
termination codon (Phe67Leufs*41).

.0006
KERATODERMA, PALMOPLANTAR, PUNCTATE TYPE IA
AAGAB, IVS, G-A, +1

In affected members of 2 Scottish families with type I punctate
palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP1A; 148600), Pohler et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a splice site mutation (870+1G-A) in the
AAGAB gene.

180231	TITLE *180231 RETINOIC ACID-BINDING PROTEIN, CELLULAR, TYPE II; CRABP2
DESCRIPTION CRABP2 is highly expressed in human skin. Giguere et al. (1990) isolated
a cDNA encoding mouse Crabp-2 by a low stringency cloning strategy using
a probe from previously cloned CRABP1 cDNA (180230). MacGregor et al.
(1992) determined the genomic organization of the murine Crabp-2 gene
and performed a detailed analysis of its transcriptional unit. It was
shown to be approximately 4.6 kb long and divided into 4 exons in a
structure common to other members of the family of serum and cellular
retinoid-binding proteins. The chromosomal location of the Crabp-2 locus
was determined by interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived
from matings of C57BL/6J and M. spretus. Mapping results indicated that
the gene is located on mouse chromosome 2 linked to muscle nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor alpha-chain (Acra) and catalase-1 (Cas-1).
MacGregor et al. (1992) suggested that the human homolog is located on
2q or 11p. Elder et al. (1992) localized the CRABP2 gene to 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Localization was confirmed by
hybridization of a CRABP2 cDNA clone against a human/mouse hybrid cell
line containing a t(1;6)(q21;q13) translocation chromosome.

Flagiello et al. (1997) mapped CRABP2 to 1q21.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

603571	TITLE *603571 VANIN 2; VNN2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mouse vanin-1 (see VNN1; 603570) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored cell surface molecule that is involved in the thymus
homing of bone marrow cells. By screening cDNA libraries with a mouse
vanin-1 cDNA, Galland et al. (1998) identified a partial human cDNA
encoding vanin-2 (VNN2), a vanin-like protein. Using RACE PCR to isolate
additional cDNAs, they determined the entire VNN2 coding sequence. The
deduced VNN2 protein shares 64% sequence identity with mouse vanin-1 and
VNN1, the human homolog of mouse vanin-1. Like VNN1, VNN2 contains a
C-terminal GPI cleavage motif; however, it lacks a leader peptide. VNN2
translated in vitro migrated as a 53-kD protein. Northern blot analysis
revealed that the 2.3-kb VNN2 mRNA is expressed in spleen, thymus,
peripheral blood lymphocytes, and kidney.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and analysis of somatic cell
hybrids, Galland et al. (1998) mapped the VNN2 gene to 6q23-q24. They
identified a YAC clone from 6q23-q24 that contained both the VNN1 and
VNN2 genes.

605515	TITLE *605515 FORKHEAD BOX P1; FOXP1
;;GLUTAMINE-RICH FACTOR 1; QRF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FOXP1 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a critical role in
monocyte differentiation and macrophage function (Shi et al., 2008).

CLONING

Li and Tucker (1993) cloned a glutamine-rich factor, which they
designated QRF1, that was expressed preferentially at the terminal
differentiation stage of B cells and in skeletal muscle. The deduced
707-amino acid QRF1 protein contains an 84-amino acid segment that shows
significant sequence homology with the DNA-binding domains of the
hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead (see FOXA1; 602294) family of
proteins.

By expression cloning using blood and testis cDNA libraries to identify
the target of a monoclonal antibody (JC12), Banham et al. (2001)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding FOXP1. The predicted 677-amino acid
protein contains coiled-coil, glutamine-rich, and serine/threonine-rich
domains in its N-terminal half; a central zinc finger domain; and
coiled-coil, serine/threonine/proline-rich, winged helix, and acidic
domains in its C-terminal half. FOXP1 also has numerous putative
phosphorylation sites, 2 nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in its
C-terminal half, and 2 PEST motif in its C-terminal acidic region.
Multiple-tissue array analysis showed ubiquitous expression of FOXP1 in
normal adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression in lymphoid and
gastrointestinal tissues. Immunohistochemistry showed that FOXP1 protein
was widely expressed, with a predominantly nuclear localization, in
normal tissues.

Wang et al. (2003) stated that there are 4 splice variants of mouse
Foxp1, designated Foxp1a through Foxp1d. They identified and cloned
Foxp1d, which encodes a Foxp1 isoform lacking the N-terminal
polyglutamine domain found in Foxp1a and Foxp1b. Northern blot analysis
and RNase protection assays showed tissue-specific expression of all 4
variants in mouse. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected
tissue-specific expression of FOXP1 variants, with highest levels in
peripheral blood lymphocytes and in caudate nucleus of brain. Western
blot analysis detected variable expression of Foxp1a, Foxp1c, and Foxp1d
in mouse tissues, with high expression of all 3 isoforms in lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2003) found that mouse Foxp1a, Foxp1c, Foxp1d, and the
related Foxp2 (605317) protein bound a 7-nucleotide core sequence,
TATTT(G/A)T. These Foxp proteins repressed gene transcription via
binding to this consensus site, which was identified within the SV40 and
IL2 (147680) promoters. In some cases, the strength of Foxp1 repression
was mediated by the polyglutamine domain. Mouse Foxp1 proteins also
formed homodimers or heterodimers with subfamily members, and the
conserved C2H2 zinc finger and leucine zipper motifs mediated
dimerization.

Using genetic manipulations, Rousso et al. (2008) demonstrated that
Foxp1 established the pattern of LIM-homeodomain protein (see 601999)
expression in embryonic mice and, accordingly, organized motor axon
projections, their connectivity with peripheral targets, and the
establishment of motor pools. Hox proteins (see 142950) dictated the
pattern of Foxp1 expression in spinal cord, and both Foxp1 and Hox were
required for segment-appropriate generation of motor columns and pools
in mouse.

Shi et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice overexpressing human FOXP1
in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Circulating blood monocytes from
these mice had reduced expression of macrophage colony-stimulating
factor receptor (CSF1R; 164770), impaired migratory capacity, and
diminished accumulation as splenic macrophages. Macrophage functions
were globally impaired, and osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption were
attenuated. Forced overexpression of Csf1r reversed many of the
deficits, suggesting that repression of Csf1r is likely the dominant
mechanism responsible for FOXP1 effects on monocyte differentiation and
macrophage function.

- Association of FOXP1 With Cancer

By analysis of a tumor/normal tissue expression array, Banham et al.
(2001) found that expression of FOXP1 was lower in colon tumors and
higher in stomach and prostate tumors compared with matched normal
tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed frequent loss of
expression, increased expression, and cytoplasmic mislocalization of the
predominantly nuclear FOXP1 protein in solid tumors.

By immunohistochemical analysis of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (BCL)
tissue microarray, Banham et al. (2005) found that untreated patients
with a high percentage of FOXP1-positive nuclei had significantly
reduced survival and earlier progression compared with FOXP1-negative
patients.

Of 275 BCLs, Haralambieva et al. (2005) found that only 5 (3
gastrointestinal, 1 thyroid, and 1 cervical lymph node) carried a
chromosomal breakpoint in the FOXP1 gene and strong nuclear FOXP1
expression. All were diffuse large BCLs rather than marginal zone BCLs.
Haralambieva et al. (2005) concluded that genetic alterations at 3p13
are associated with strong FOXP1 expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Banham et al. (2001) mapped the FOXP1 gene
to chromosome 3p14.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Streubel et al. (2005) noted that 3 chromosomal translocations,
t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(14;18)(q32;q21), and t(1;14)(p22;q32), are
associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. They
identified a t(3;14)(p14;q32) in a case of MALT lymphoma of the thyroid.
FISH studies showed that the IGH locus (147100) was rearranged, and
long-distance inverse PCR identified FOXP1 as the partner gene on
chromosome 3. Using FISH assays to screen 91 MALT lymphomas negative for
3 common translocations, Streubel et al. (2005) identified
t(3;14)(p14;q32) in 9 cases (3 thyroid, 4 ocular adnexa, and 2 skin).
Most t(3;14)(p14;q32)-positive MALT lymphomas also harbored additional
genetic abnormalities, such as trisomy 3. All 4 of the MALT-associated
translocations were mutually exclusive. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed
upregulated expression of FOXP1 in MALT cases with t(3;14)(p14;q32) or
trisomy 3. Streubel et al. (2005) concluded that FOXP1 is a
translocation partner of IGH in a site-dependent subset of MALT
lymphomas.

Carr et al. (2010) reported a boy with severe speech delay and delayed
motor development (see 613670) who carried a de novo heterozygous 1.0-Mb
interstitial deletion of chromosome 3p14.1 that involved only the FOXP1
gene. The phenotype was confounded by a Chiari I malformation, which was
surgically corrected at age 30 months. The patient had delayed gross
motor skills and walked at 16 months. After surgery for the Chiari
malformation, he had some improvement in motor skills. The most
significant feature was speech delay with limited verbal output and
difficulty in articulating entire words and multisyllabic speech,
although he did not have a deficit in oromotor coordination. At age 4
years, he developed staring spells with motor arrest associated with
epileptiform discharges. He had mild dysmorphic facial features,
including broad forehead, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral
fissures, ptosis, short nose, broad nasal tip, and smooth philtrum. Carr
et al. (2010) concluded that FOXP1 may play a role in the development of
verbal and motor skills.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hamdan et al. (2010) identified 2 different de novo heterozygous
mutations in the FOXP1 gene (605515.0001 and 605515.0002, respectively)
in 2 unrelated children of French Canadian origin with moderate mental
retardation, expressive language deficits, and autistic features
(613670). The first mutation (605515.0001) was a small deletion found
using array-based comparative genomic hybridization of a cohort of 80
patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 30 with intellectual
disability. The second mutation (R525X; 605515.0002) was found by direct
sequencing of the FOXP1 gene in a cohort of 110 patients with
intellectual disability, 84 with ASD, and 51 with both. Hamdan et al.
(2010) chose to examine the FOXP1 gene specifically because of the role
of the FOXP2 gene (605317) in a speech and language disorder (SPCH1;
602081); patients with intellectual disability and ASD often show
language impairment. The results indicated that disruption of FOXP1 has
a global impact on brain development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hu et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Foxp1 died at embryonic day
14.5 due to heart valve and outflow tract abnormalities. Reconstitution
of Rag2 (179616)-deficient mice with Foxp1 -/- or Foxp1 +/- fetal liver
cells resulted in decreased mature B cells, but normal thymocytes, in
the recipients. Foxp1 -/- pro-B cells had reduced IgM, Rag1 (179615),
and Rag2 expression, and V(D)J rearrangement was also impaired in Foxp1
-/- B cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA analyses showed that
Foxp1 bound to Foxp site-2 (Fkh2) in the Erag enhancer, which is
upstream of Rag2, in a B-lineage specific way. Hu et al. (2006)
concluded that FOXP1 influences B-cell development at an early stage,
and that FOXP1 deficiency results in a phenotype that resembles double
haploinsufficiency of E2A (TCF3; 147141) and EBF (164343).

Feng et al. (2010) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Foxp1
in double-positive thymocytes and found that peripheral Cd4 (see 186940)
and Cd8 (see 186910) cells also lacked Foxp1 and that single-positive
thymocytes acquired an activated phenotype in thymus. Peripheral cells
also exhibited an activated phenotype and increased apoptosis and
readily produced cytokines upon T-cell receptor engagement. Feng et al.
(2010) concluded that FOXP1 is an essential transcriptional regulator
for thymocyte development and the generation of quiescent naive T cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, 390-KB DEL

In a French Canadian girl who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 390-kb intragenic deletion in the
FOXP1 gene. The deletion encompassed exons 4 to 14 of the longest FOXP1
isoform, including the translation initiation site and leucine zipper
and zinc finger domains important for transcriptional activity.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, ARG525TER

In a French Canadian boy who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1573C-T transition in the FOXP1 gene,
resulting in an arg525-to-ter (R525X) substitution. The mutation was
predicted to abolish the last 152 residues of the protein, including
part of the forkhead DNA-binding (FHD) domain and a conserved nuclear
localization signal. The mutation was not found in 570 controls. In
vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the
R525X mutant impaired the transcriptional repression ability of FOXP1,
consistent with a loss of function.

602137	TITLE *602137 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX, 2; NDUFA2
;;B8 PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NDUFA2 gene encodes one of the accessory subunits of complex I, the
first and largest complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Hoefs
et al., 2008).

For a discussion of complex I, see 516000.

CLONING

Dunbar et al. (1997) reported the genomic cloning and fluorescence in
situ hybridization mapping of 5 nuclear-encoded human complex I genes.

Ton et al. (1997) isolated human heart cDNAs encoding the CI-B8, CI-SGDH
(603841), CI-B14 (602138), CI-B12 (603839), and CI-KFYI (603844)
subunits of the HP fraction. Human and bovine B8 protein shared 94%
sequence identity.

Loeffen et al. (1998) noted that complex I can be fragmented into 3
different fractions. The flavoprotein fraction contains the NDUFV1
(161015), NDUFV2 (600532), and NDUFV3 (602184) subunits and the
iron-sulfur protein (IP) fraction contains at least 7 subunits,
NDUFS1-NDUFS6 (see, e.g., 157655) and NDUFA5 (601677). The remaining
subunits, including NDUFA2, are part of the hydrophobic protein (HP)
fraction, which is involved in proton translocation. Loeffen et al.
(1998) reported cDNA sequences of 8 nuclear-encoded subunits located
within the hydrophobic protein fraction of NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase.

MAPPING

Dunbar et al. (1997) mapped NDUFA2 to chromosome 5q31. Emahazion and
Brookes (1998) showed that of the 5 complex I genes mapped by Dunbar et
al. (1997), only the mapping of NDUFA2 was correct. (See NDUFA6
(602138), NDUFA7 (602139), NDUFB8 (602140), and NDUFS8 (602141).)

By intron-based radiation hybrid mapping, Emahazion and Brookes (1998)
mapped the NDUFA2 gene to chromosome 5q31.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a boy with Leigh syndrome (256000) due to mitochondrial complex I
deficiency (252010), Hoefs et al. (2008) identified a homozygous splice
site mutation in the NDUFA2 gene (602137.0001).

NOMENCLATURE

Mammalian complex I has been studied extensively in Bos taurus. The
names of some the bovine complex I subunits designate the single-letter
code for the 4 N-terminal amino acids (e.g., SGDH). The names of
subunits B8-B22 designate their molecular weights (Walker et al., 1992).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFA2, IVS2DS, G-A, +5

In a Turkish boy with Leigh syndrome (256000) due to mitochondrial
complex I deficiency (252010), born of first-cousin parents, Hoefs et
al. (2008) identified a homozygous G-to-A transition in intron 2 of the
NDUFA2 gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 2 and generation of a
prematurely truncated protein, which was confirmed by PCR analysis. He
had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and developmental delay from birth, and
brain MRI showed cerebral atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum.
After a varicella infection, he developed severe acidosis, seizures, and
coma, and died of cardiovascular arrest at age 11 months. MRI just
before death showed demyelinization of corticospinal tracts and subacute
necrotizing encephalomyelopathy consistent with Leigh syndrome. The
fibroblast and muscle complex I enzymatic activities were 36% and 20% of
control values, respectively. Further studies showed that the NDUFA2
mutation resulted in disturbed assembly and stability of complex I and
decreased complex I activity. In patient fibroblasts, the defect could
be corrected with a baculoviral vector.

182205	TITLE *182205 SEX HORMONE-BINDING GLOBULIN; SHBG
;;ANDROGEN-BINDING PROTEIN; ABP;;
TESTOSTERONE-BINDING BETA-GLOBULIN; TEBG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a previously characterized liver cDNA as a probe, Gershagen et al.
(1989) isolated a liver-secreted plasma glycoprotein that binds sex
steroids. Screening of a human testis cDNA library resulted in the
isolation of 2 distinct cDNA forms. One was identical to the previously
characterized liver SHBG cDNA, thus suggesting that human SHBG and the
androgen-binding protein (ABP) produced by Sertoli cells are encoded by
the same gene. The second cDNA differed from the first by having exon 1
exchanged with a completely different sequence and exon 7 deleted.
Primer extension experiments showed that the alternatively spliced
transcript corresponding to the second cDNA is present in both liver and
testis. From the primary structure of the putative SHBG-gene-related
protein, Gershagen et al. (1989) deduced that the protein is very
different from SHBG and probably without steroid-binding activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

By Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA, Gershagen et al. (1989) found
evidence indicating that only 1 SHBG is present in the human haploid
genome. The gene has 8 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Berube et al. (1990) localized the SHBG gene
to chromosome 17p13-p12. By the study of intersubspecies backcrosses,
Joseph et al. (1991) found that Shbg is located on mouse chromosome 11
in close linkage to several neurologic mutations, one of which, Tr, is
associated with male sterility. The fact that ABP-SHBG is found
throughout the rat brain suggested that these mutations may represent a
defect in Shbg.

GENE FUNCTION

Testosterone in plasma is present in both bound and unbound form; only
the unbound hormone is biologically active and available to tissues.
About 66% of testosterone is bound to testosterone-binding beta-globulin
(TEBG), 31% to albumin, and 1.5% to transcortin; 2% is unbound. The
regulatory function of TEBG is said to be well illustrated by female
hirsutism; although many hirsute women have normal levels of total
plasma testosterone, nearly all have depressed levels of TEBG, resulting
in increased levels of unbound testosterone (Wenn et al., 1977; Raj et
al., 1978).

In mice expressing an 11-kb human SHBG transgene and in HepG2
hepatoblastoma cells, Selva et al. (2007) demonstrated that the
monosaccharides glucose and fructose reduced human SHBG production by
hepatocytes, irrespective of the presence of insulin, by downregulation
of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4A (HNF4A; 600281) and replacement of HNF4A
by COUP-TFI (NR2F1; 132890) at a cis-element within the human SHBG
promoter, coincident with repression of its transcriptional activity.
Dose-dependent reduction of HNF4A in HepG2 cells occurred in concert
with parallel increases in cellular palmitate levels and could be
mimicked by treatment with palmitoyl-CoA; inhibition of lipogenesis
prevented monosaccharide-induced downregulation of HNF4A and reduced
SHBG expression in HepG2 cells. Selva et al. (2007) concluded that
monosaccharide-induced lipogenesis reduces hepatic HNF4A levels, which
in turn attenuates SHBG expression, and noted that this provides a
biologic explanation for the sensitivity of SHBG as a biomarker of the
metabolic syndrome.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1977) developed an ingenious method for detection
of genetic variation in plasma proteins, namely, electrophoretic
screening after treatment with radioactive ligands such as vitamins,
hormones, metal ions and drugs. This is essentially a method of
'staining' the protein comparable to the methods using dyes. With this
approach they identified polymorphism of testosterone-binding
beta-globulin, as well as a possible silent allele. By polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE), Luckock and Cavalli-Sforza (1983) identified
4 electrophoretic variants, which they suggested result from
combinations of 3 alleles, designated N ('normal'), S ('slow'), and O
('absent'). The first 2 are codominant and the third recessive. The
frequencies of the 3 alleles in white Americans were, respectively,
0.68, 0.11, 0.21; in black Americans, 0.65, 0.14, 0.22; in Japanese
Americans, 0.59, 0.09, 0.32. Phenotype frequencies and segregation from
various crosses supported simple mendelian inheritance of an autosomal
gene.

By investigating neuraminidase-treated serum samples using isoelectric
focusing (IEF) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and
immunostaining, van Baelen et al. (1992) distinguished 3 patterns
consistent with the expression of a biallelic autosomal system. They
published data on allele frequencies in many populations and found
frequencies of the common allele (SHBG*1) varying from 0.848 in Chinese
to 0.985 in Balinese; monomorphism was found only in Australian
Aborigines, all 47 of whom were SHBG*1 homozygotes. Van Baelen et al.
(1992) found no significant difference for allele frequencies among
hirsute Belgian women. They also presented evidence that the subunit
produced by the SHBG*2 allele has a higher molecular mass than the one
produced by the SHBG*1 allele and that the 3 SHBG genotypes have
identical binding characteristics for 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Power et al. (1992) demonstrated in a Belgian patient homozygous for a
variant isoelectric focusing pattern that a point mutation was present
in exon 8, creating an additional site for N-linked glycosylation.
Expression studies showed that steroid binding was not affected. Hardy
et al. (1995) found the same mutation in Mexican subjects who were
heterozygous for the variant IEF phenotype. Denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to localize the mutation in these
subjects and to purify the variant allele for DNA sequence analysis. A
GAC-to-AAC transition in codon 327 caused an asp-to-asn substitution in
the protein (D327N). The site of the mutation does not lie within the
predicted steroid-binding site of the molecule. The finding in these
widely separated populations suggested that the SHBG gene is biallelic
worldwide. The polymorphism was not associated with any pathologic
condition.

Xita et al. (2003) investigated the possible association of the
functional (TAAAA)n polymorphism in the promoter of the SHBG gene
(Hogeveen et al., 2001) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; 184700)
and SHBG levels. They studied 185 women with PCOS and 324 normal
controls. Genotyping revealed 6 (TAAAA)n alleles containing 6 to 11
repeats. The distribution of these alleles was different in the 2
groups. Women with PCOS had a significantly greater frequency of longer
(TAAAA)n alleles (more than 8 repeats) than normal women who had shorter
alleles (fewer than 8 repeats) in higher frequency (P = 0.001). In the
PCOS group, carriers of the longer allele genotypes had lower SHBG
levels than those with shorter alleles. The authors concluded that SHBG
may be a susceptibility gene for PCOS and may provide the genetic link
for the developmental origin hypothesis for PCOS that was proposed on
the basis of experimental observations in prenatally androgenized sheep
and primates (Abbott et al., 2002).

In a population of 303 women referred for hirsutism, Cousin et al.
(2004) investigated the relationship between the D327N mutation in SHBG
exon 8, the pentanucleotide repeat polymorphism (TAAAA)n in the SHBG
5-prime untranslated region, and SHBG levels. The D327N mutant allele
was associated with higher SHBG levels than was the wildtype.
Multivariate analysis showed that BMI, PCOS status, and D327N
polymorphism influenced plasma SHBG concentrations, each of these
parameters contributing independently of the others. A strong
disequilibrium linkage was found between the D327N variant allele and an
allele with 8 TAAAA repeats (P less than 0.0001). The authors suggested
that this linkage disequilibrium could mask the effect of the TAAAA
repeat polymorphism on SHBG concentration in vivo. Nevertheless, SHBG
levels in patients who were homozygous for 6 repeats were significantly
(P = 0.043) higher than in 9-repeat homozygous patients and lay between
the two for 8-repeat homozygous patients. Results supported the notion
that polymorphism within the coding sequence and, potentially, in the
regulatory sequence of the SHBG gene is associated with circulating SHBG
levels and may represent part of the genetic background of sex steroid
hormone activity in humans.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the SHBG
gene and type 2 diabetes, see 125853.

- SHBG Circulating Level Quantitative Trait Locus

Eriksson et al. (2006) studied whether either of 2 polymorphisms in the
SHBG gene promoter, a (TAAAA)n microsatellite and the SNP dbSNP
rs1799941, are associated with serum levels of SHBG (613498), sex
steroids, or bone mineral density (BMD) in men. In both cohorts,
(TAAAA)n and dbSNP rs1799941 genotypes were associated with serum levels
of SHBG (P less than 0.001), dihydrotestosterone (P less than 0.05), and
5-alpha-androstane-3-alpha,17-beta-diol glucuronides (P less than 0.05).
In the elderly men, they were also associated with testosterone and BMD
at all hip bone sites. Eriksson et al. (2006) concluded that
polymorphisms in the SHBG promoter predict serum levels of SHBG,
androgens, and glucuronidated androgen metabolites, and hip BMD in men.

In the NCI-Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium using 874 SNPs
in 37 candidate genes in the sex steroid hormone pathway, Ahn et al.
(2009) identified a G-A variant (dbSNP rs1799941) located 67 bp upstream
from the transcription start site of the SHBG gene associated with
increased mean circulating levels of SHBG in 4,720 Caucasian men (p =
4.52 x 10(-21); 26.9% increase in AA homozygotes versus wildtype
homozygotes). The relationship between dbSNP rs1799941 was consistent
across the 5 cohorts in the study, age, BMI, and case-control status.
Additionally, dbSNP rs1799941 was also strongly associated with
increased mean circulating levels of testosterone in 4,678 Caucasian men
(p = 7.54 x 10(-15); 14.3% increase in AA homozygotes versus wildtype
homozygotes). Since clearance and bioavailability of testosterone are
related to SHBG levels, Ahn et al. (2009) used regression analysis to
show that also tended to predict SHBG adjusted-testosterone levels (p =
1.33 x 10(-3)).

HISTORY

Gross and Horton (1971) presented evidence indicating 'dominant'
segregation of the trait and low testosterone-binding protein, and
suggested Y-linkage. Hecht and Kimberling (1971) pointed out that since
the Y chromosome represents only about 2% of the human male haploid
genome, Bayesian correction of the estimate of Y-linkage reduces the
value to 1 in 3.

238310	TITLE *238310 AMINOMETHYLTRANSFERASE; AMT
;;GLYCINE CLEAVAGE SYSTEM T PROTEIN; GCST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The enzyme system for cleavage of glycine (glycine cleavage system; EC
2.1.2.10), which is confined to the mitochondria, is composed of 4
protein components: P protein (a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent glycine
decarboxylase; GLDC, 238300), H protein (a lipoic acid-containing
protein; GCSH, 238330), T protein (a tetrahydrofolate-requiring enzyme),
and L protein (a lipoamide dehydrogenase; DLD, 238331).

Mutations in the T, P, and H proteins have been found to cause glycine
encephalopathy (GCE; 605899).

CLONING

The T protein of the glycine cleavage system is also known as
aminomethyltransferase (AMT). Nanao et al. (1994) isolated the AMT gene
from a human placenta cosmid library. They found that the gene is about
6 kb long and contains 9 exons. They identified 2 putative
glucocorticoid-responsive elements and a putative thyroid
hormone-responsive element. By dot-blot analysis, Kure et al. (2001)
detected expression of AMT in all tissues tested except stomach and bone
marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakata et al. (2001) reported the structure and expression of the
glycine cleavage system in rat central nervous system.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nanao et al. (1994) assigned the
AMT gene to 3p21.2-p21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with glycine encephalopathy, Nanao et al. (1994) identified
mutations in the AMT gene (238310.0001-238310.0002).

Toone et al. (2000) studied 14 unrelated patients with glycine
encephalopathy and identified mutations in 4 cases. In 2 patients,
mutations were identified in the T protein: 1 patient was homozygous for
an arg320-to-his mutation (R320H; 238310.0006), and the other patient
was heterozygous for a novel glutamine-to-termination substitution at
codon 192 (238310.0007).

Applegarth and Toone (2001) reviewed the laboratory diagnosis of glycine
encephalopathy and confirmed 9 mutations in the T protein and 8
mutations in the P protein. They also reviewed the 7 cases of transient
NKH known at that time.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY269ASP

Nanao et al. (1994) found that a patient with typical glycine
encephalopathy (605899) was homozygous for a missense mutation in the
AMT gene, a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-asp substitution at
amino acid 269 (G269D).

.0002
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY47ARG

In 2 sisters with atypical glycine encephalopathy (605899), Nanao et al.
(1994) found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the T
protein gene: a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-arg substitution
at amino acid 47 (G47R) in 1 allele, and a G-to-A transition leading to
an arg-to-his substitution at amino acid 320 (R320H; 238310.0006) in the
other allele. Nanao et al. (1994) pointed out that gly269, which was
mutant in the typically severe case they studied (see 238300.0001), is
conserved in T proteins of various species, even in E. coli, whereas
gly47 and arg320, which were mutant in the atypical and milder cases,
are replaced by ala and leu, respectively, in E. coli. Thus, mutation
occurring in more conservative amino acid residues results in more
deleterious damage to the T protein and a more severe clinical
phenotype.

.0003
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, HIS42ARG

Kure et al. (1998) reported a large Israeli-Arab kindred with glycine
encephalopathy (605899). Enzymatic analysis demonstrated that T-protein
activity was deficient in the liver from 1 affected person in the
family. Mutation detection revealed a missense mutation in exon 2
resulting in an amino acid substitution from histidine to arginine at
position 42 (his42 to arg). Homozygosity for the H42R mutation was seen
in all affected members of the family.

.0004
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, 1-BP DEL, 183C

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899), Kure et al.
(1998) described a 1-bp deletion (183delC) and a missense mutation,
asp276 to his (238310.0005).

.0005
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ASP276HIS

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899) of neonatal
onset, Kure et al. (1998) found a G-to-C substitution at position 955 in
exon 7, resulting in an amino acid change from aspartate to histidine at
position 276.

.0006
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ARG320HIS

See 238310.0001 and Nanao et al. (1994).

Toone et al. (2001) screened a DNA bank from 50 patients with
enzymatically confirmed NKH and identified the arg320-to-his (R320H)
mutation in 7% of alleles.

.0007
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLN192TER

In a patient with neonatal-onset NKH (605899), Toone et al. (2000)
identified a C-to-T transition resulting in a glutamine-to-termination
codon substitution at residue 192 (Q192X). The other mutation in this
patient was not identified.

.0008
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, IVS7, G-A, -1

Toone et al. (2001) reported a novel splice site mutation at the -1
position of intron 7 of the AMT gene: G was converted to A. This
mutation was found in 3 unrelated families and was not found in any
normal controls.

606758	TITLE *606758 DUAL OXIDASE 1; DUOX1
;;THYROID OXIDASE 1; THOX1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The synthesis of thyroid hormone is catalyzed by a protein complex
located at the apical membrane of thyroid follicular cells. Contained
within this complex is an iodide transporter (605646), thyroperoxidase
(TPO; 274500), and a peroxide generating system that includes DUOX1 and
DUOX2 (606759) (De Deken et al., 2000).

CLONING

Using a probe for a leukocyte NADPH oxidase, De Deken et al. (2000)
cloned a full-length DUOX1 cDNA from a primary human thyroid cell cDNA
library. The deduced 1,551-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 177 kD. It contains several domains characteristic of
flavoproteins including NADPH- and FAD-binding domains, and 4 specific
histidines and a conserved arginine predicted to bind a heme prosthetic
group. DUOX2 also contains 2 EF-hand motifs, 4 putative N-glycosylation
sites, and 7 hydrophobic stretches. It shares 83% and 53% sequence
similarity with DUOX2 and gp91-phox (300481), respectively, and
significant similarity to other NADPH oxidases. DUOX1 and DUOX2 share
53% and 61% sequence similarity, respectively, with a predicted protein
in C. elegans. Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 5.7-kb
DUOX1 transcript in cultured human thymocytes. Immunolocalization
studies demonstrated that DUOX1 colocalizes with thyroperoxidase at the
supranuclear apical pole of all thyroid cells.

GENE FUNCTION

De Deken et al. (2000) detected upregulated expression of DUOX1 and
DUOX2 mRNA in cultured human thymocytes stimulated with cAMP agonists.
In a study of thyroid carcinomas, Lacroix et al. (2001) showed that
levels of DUOX1 and DUOX2 were maintained in parallel and were more
frequently seen in neoplastic tissues expressing other thyroid
differentiation markers.

Caillou et al. (2001) investigated the gene and protein expression of
DUOX1 and DUOX2 in normal and pathologic human thyroid tissues using
real-time kinetic quantitative PCR and antipeptide antibodies,
respectively. In normal tissue, DUOX1 and DUOX2 localized at the apical
pole of thyrocytes. Immunostaining for DUOX1 and DUOX2 was
heterogeneous, inside a given follicle, with 40 to 60% of positive
follicular cells. Among normal and pathologic tissues, variations of
DUOX1 and DUOX2 mRNA levels were parallel, suggesting a similar
regulation of both gene expressions. The authors concluded that DUOX
proteins are apical glycoproteins with a regulation of expression that
differs from that of other thyroid markers. Because DUOX1 and DUOX2 are
not absolutely thyroid-specific, and because they constitute a novel
family of long homologs of the NOX flavoproteins and were predicted to
form a part of NADPH:O(2)-oxidoreductase systems, Caillou et al. (2001)
referred to the DUOX proteins as LNOX (for 'long NOX') 1 and 2.

Niethammer et al. (2009) probed the role of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
during the early events of wound responses in zebrafish larvae
expressing the genetically encoded H2O2 sensor. This reporter revealed a
sustained rise in H2O2 concentration at the wound margin, starting
approximately 3 minutes after wounding and peaking at approximately 20
minutes, which extended 100 to 200 microns into the tail fin epithelium
as a decreasing concentration gradient. Using pharmacologic and genetic
inhibition, they showed that this gradient is created by dual oxidase
(Duox1 and Duox2, 606759) and that it is required for rapid requirement
of leukocytes to the wound. Niethammer et al. (2009) concluded that this
was the first observation of a tissue-scale H2O2 pattern, and the first
evidence that H2O2 signals to leukocytes in tissues, in addition to its
known antiseptic role.

EVOLUTION

Grasberger and Refetoff (2006) found that the DUOX/DUOXA arrangement is
highly conserved. The bidirectional association of Duox and Duoxa
emerged before the divergence of echinoderms. Teleosts have single
copies of the Duox and Duoxa genes, and these underwent tandem
duplication to an inverted repeat (Duox2/Duoxa2 (612772)/Duoxa1
(612771)/Duox1) in vertebrates before the amphibian divergence.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, De Deken et al. (2000) mapped the DUOX1
and DUOX2 genes on chromosome 15q15.3.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribonuclease P (RNase P) removes the 5-prime leader sequences from
precursor tRNA molecules. RNase P consists of an RNA species (H1 RNA),
the POP1 protein (602486), and at least 7 proteins called RPPs. The RPPs
have apparent molecular masses of 14 kD (RPP14), 20 kD (RPP20; 606113),
25 kD (RPP25), 29 kD (RPP29; 606114), 30 kD (RPP30; 606115), 38 kD
(RPP38; 606116), and 40 kD (RPP40; 606117). Patients with scleroderma
(181750) have serum reactive with RNase P, the Th antigen, which is also
referred to as the To antigen, and RPP30 and RPP38 (summary by Jarrous
et al., 1998, 1999).

By biochemical purification of RNase P, micropeptide sequence analysis,
and EST database searching, Jarrous et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding RPP14. The deduced basic protein has 124 amino acids and a
predicted molecular mass of nearly 14 kD. Immunoblot analysis showed
that antibodies to RPP14 or RPP29 precipitate native RNase P.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the RPP14 gene to chromosome 3p14.3 based on an
alignment of the RPP14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF001175) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;D-FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATE 1-PHOSPHOHYDROLASE;;
FRUCTOSE-1,6-BISPHOSPHATASE, MUSCLE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (fru-1,6-P2ase, EC 3.1.3.11) catalyzes the
hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and
inorganic phosphate, thus providing a mechanism to permit the reversal
of the glycolysis reaction catalyzed by 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. See
the entry for fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1; 611570), the human
liver FBPase. Tillmann and Eschrich (1998) stated that human liver and
muscle fru-1,6-P2ases appear to be distinct enzymes since they differ
significantly in their kinetic properties, and no reduction of
fru-1,6-P2ase activity was found in muscle in patients with hereditary
liver fru-1,6-P2ase deficiency (229700).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of skeletal muscle RNA with primers based on conserved regions
of fru-1,6-P2ases, Tillmann and Eschrich (1998) isolated a partial cDNA
encoding a novel fru-1,6-P2ase. Using a PCR strategy, they recovered
additional cDNAs which together corresponded to the entire coding region
of the gene. The predicted 339-amino acid muscle fru-1,6-P2ase shares
77% protein sequence identity with the liver enzyme. Recombinant enzyme
had fru-1,6-P2ase activity in vitro.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FBP2
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP sts-F16656).

605171	TITLE *605171 TUMOR PROTEIN p53-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN 3; TP53I3
;;p53-INDUCED GENE 3; PIG3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

DNA damage and/or hyperproliferative signals activate wildtype p53 tumor
suppressor protein (TP53; 191170), inducing cell cycle arrest or
apoptosis. Mutations that inactivate p53 occur in 50% of all tumors.
Polyak et al. (1997) used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to
evaluate cellular mRNA levels in a colorectal cancer cell line
transfected with p53. Of 7,202 transcripts identified, only 14 were
expressed at levels more than 10-fold higher in p53-expressing cells
than in control cells. Polyak et al. (1997) termed these genes
'p53-induced genes,' or PIGs, several of which were predicted to encode
redox-controlling proteins. They noted that reactive oxygen species
(ROS) are potent inducers of apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis showed
that p53 expression induces ROS production, which increases as apoptosis
progresses under some conditions. The authors stated that the PIG3 gene
encodes a quinone oxidoreductase homolog (see 123691).

MAPPING

By analysis of a BAC clone, Polyak et al. (1997) mapped the PIG3 gene to
2p.

GENE FUNCTION

The gene PIG3 is induced by the tumor suppressor p53 but not by p53
mutants unable to induce apoptosis, suggesting its involvement in
p53-mediated cell death. Contente et al. (2002) showed that p53 directly
binds and activates the PIG3 promoter, but not through the DNA element
described by Polyak et al. (1997). Instead, p53 interacts with a
pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence within the PIG3 promoter
(TGYCC)n where Y = C or T. Despite its limited similarity to the
p53-binding consensus, this sequence is necessary and sufficient for
transcriptional activation of the PIG3 promoter by p53 and binds
specifically to p53 in vitro and in vivo. In a population of 117 healthy
donors from Germany, the microsatellite was found to be polymorphic, the
number of pentanucleotide repeats being 10, 15, 16, or 17, and the
frequency of alleles 5.1%, 62.0%, 21.4%, and 11.5%, respectively. The
number of repeats directly correlated with the extent of transcriptional
activation by p53. This was the first time that a microsatellite had
been shown to mediate the induction of a promoter through direct
interaction with a transcription factor. Moreover, this sequence of PIG3
was the first p53-responsive element found to be polymorphic. Contente
et al. (2002) suggested that inheritance of this microsatellite may
affect an individual's susceptibility to cancer.

609764	TITLE *609764 LYSINE-SPECIFIC DEMETHYLASE 4A; KDM4A
;;JUMONJI DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2A; JMJD2A;;
JHDM3A;;
KIAA0677
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KDM4 proteins are Fe(II)- and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases
that function as histone demethylases. KDM4A plays important roles in a
variety of biologic processes, including transcription and DNA damage
response, through demethylation of histone H3 (see 602810) lys9 (H3K9)
and lys36 (H3K36) di- and trimethylation (summary by Tan et al. (2011)).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned JMJD2A, which they designated
KIAA0677. The deduced protein shares significant similarity with a zinc
finger protein of S. cerevisiae. RT-PCR detected JMJD2A in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in ovary.

By searching for sequences similar to JMJD1C (604503), Katoh and Katoh
(2004) identified several JMJD2 family genes, including JMJD2A. JMJD2A
encodes a deduced 1,064-amino acid protein. Like JMJD2B (609765) and
JMJD2C (605469), JMJD2A contains a JmjN domain, a JmjC domain, a JD2H
domain, 2 TUDOR domains, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal
that overlaps the C-terminal part of the second TUDOR domain. JmjN is a
small domain found in the Jumonji family of transcription factors (see
601594). JmjC is a putative enzymatic domain. JD2H is a region
containing 2 cys-his clusters with weak similarity to a PHD domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Klose et al. (2006) demonstrated that JMJD2A is capable of removing the
trimethyl group from modified H3K9 and H3K36. Overexpression of JMJD2A
abrogates recruitment of HP1 (see 604478) to heterochromatin, indicating
a role for JMJD2A in antagonizing methylated H3K9 nucleated events.
siRNA-mediated knockdown of JMJD2A leads to increased levels of H3K9
methylation and upregulation of a JMJD2A target gene, ASCL2 (601886),
indicating that JMJD2A may function in euchromatin to remove histone
methylation marks that are associated with active transcription.

Whetstine et al. (2006) showed that JMJD2A reversed trimethylated H3K9
and H3K36 to dimethylated products, but not to monomethylated or
unmethylated products. Overexpression of JMJD2A, but not a catalytically
inactive mutant, reduced H3K9 and H3K36 trimethylation levels in
cultured cells.

Tan et al. (2011) noted that the abundance of KDM4A protein, but not
mRNA, is cell cycle dependent, with highest levels in G1 and S phase and
reduced levels in G2 and during mitosis. Using human cell lines, they
showed that KDM4A protein was subject to proteasome-mediated degradation
via the SKP1 (SKP1A; 601434)-CUL1 (603134)-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin
ligase complex. Immunoprecipitation analysis of F box
protein-transfected cells revealed that KDM4A specifically interacted
with FBXO22 (609096) and not with other F-box proteins tested. Mutation
analysis showed that the C-terminal FIST-C domain of FBXO22 interacted
with the N-terminal JmjN/JmjC domain of KDM4A. Knockdown and
overexpression studies revealed that KDM4A polyubiquitination mediated
by the FBXO22-containing SCF complex led to reduced KDM4A protein
levels. Subsequently, reduced KDM4A levels permitted elevated global
content of H3K9 and H3K36 trimethylation and specifically elevated
trimethylation of the ASCL2 promoter, resulting in increased ASCL2
transcription.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structures

Chen et al. (2006) solved the crystal structure of the catalytic core
domain of JMJD2A with and without alpha-ketoglutarate in the presence of
Fe(2+). The catalytic core region spans residues 1 to 350 and includes
the N-terminal JmjN domain, followed by a long beta hairpin motif, a
motif composed of mixed helices and beta strands, the JmjC domain, and a
C-terminal domain. Chen et al. (2006) also identified a zinc finger
motif within this region, in which the JmjC domain provides a cysteine
and a histidine and the C-terminal domain contributes 2 cysteines.
Structural analysis suggested that a region near beta strands 5 and 6,
which are located between the JmjN and JmjC domains, may function in
substrate peptide binding. Mutation analysis revealed that ser288 and
thr289 are involved in methyl group recognition.

Ng et al. (2007) demonstrated how human JMJD2A, which is selective
towards tri- and dimethylated histone H3 lysyl residues 9 and 36
(H3K9me3/me2 and H3K36me3/me2), discriminates between methylation states
and achieves sequence selectivity for H3K9. The authors reported the
crystal structures of JMJD2A-nickel(II)-zinc(II) inhibitor complexes
bound to tri, di-, and monomethyl forms of H3K9 and the trimethyl form
of H3K36. The structures revealed a lysyl-binding pocket in which
substrates are bound in distinct bent conformations involving the
zinc-binding site. Ng et al. (2007) proposed a mechanism for achieving
methylation state selectivity involving the orientation of the substrate
methyl groups towards a ferryl intermediate. The results suggested
distinct recognition mechanisms in different demethylase subfamilies.

MAPPING

Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the JMJD2A gene to chromosome 1 by
radiation hybrid analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh
(2004) mapped the JMJD2A gene to 1p34.1.

;;O-LINKED N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINASE; OGA;;
O-GlcNAcase;;
NUCLEAR CYTOPLASMIC O-GlcNAcase AND ACETYLTRANSFERASE; NCOAT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The dynamic modification of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins by O-linked
N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) addition and removal on serine and
threonine residues is catalyzed by OGT (300255), which adds O-GlcNAc,
and MGEA5, a glycosidase that removes O-GlcNAc modifications (Gao et
al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening a meningioma expression library with autologous serum,
Heckel et al. (1998) identified 4 cDNA clones representing a novel gene,
which they designated meningioma-expressed antigen-5, with striking
homology to C. elegans hyaluronidase. MGEA5 was noted to have
hyaluronidase activity, but was otherwise not characterized.

By sequencing randomly selected cDNAs corresponding to relatively long
transcripts from human brain, Ishikawa et al. (1998) isolated an MGEA5
cDNA, which they designated KIAA0679, encoding a deduced 767-amino acid
protein. RT-PCR detected high MGEA5 expression in all tissues examined.

By searching databases for sequences similar to bovine O-GlcNAcase,
followed by 5-prime RACE of a brain cDNA library, Gao et al. (2001)
cloned human MGEA5, or O-GlcNAcase. The deduced 916-amino acid protein
has an N-terminal domain of about 400 amino acids and a C-terminal
domain of about 350 amino acids that are highly conserved in vertebrate
and invertebrate homologs. The central region of about 150 amino acids
is highly variable. Northern blot analysis detected O-GlcNAcase in all
human tissues examined, with highest expression in brain, followed by
placenta and pancreas, and lowest expression in lung and liver.

Comtesse et al. (2001) identified a splice variant of MGEA5, which they
called MGEA5s, that includes part of intron 10 and has an alternative
stop codon and alternative polyadenylation signal. The deduced 677-amino
acid protein lacks the C-terminal acetyltransferase domain. Both MGEA5
and MGEA5s contain several possible phosphorylation sites,
N-glycosylation sites, and O-glycosylation sites. Western blot analysis
of a fractionated human glioblastoma cell line detected MGEA5 at an
apparent molecular mass of 130 kD in the cytoplasmic fraction, and
MGEA5s at an apparent molecular mass of 75 kD in the nuclear fraction. A
fraction containing membrane and cytoskeletal components showed the
130-kD protein. Toleman et al. (2004) identified a variant of rat Mgea5,
which they called Ncoat, that encodes a protein with the
acetyltransferase domain, but lacking the O-GlcNAcase domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Gao et al. (2001) demonstrated that COS-7 cells overexpressing human
O-GlcNAcase showed elevated O-GlcNAcase activity. Recombinant human
O-GlcNAcase displayed properties distinct from lysosomal
beta-hexosaminidase (see HEXA; 606869), with distinct substrate
preference and inhibitor sensitivity. O-GlcNAcase had a pH optimum of
5.7 to 7.0 and retained significant activity up to pH 8.0. It showed
strict substrate specificity for beta-linked GlcNAc, and it cleaved
GlcNAc attached to a test peptide.

Toleman et al. (2004) demonstrated that rodent Ncoat, when expressed in
a mammalian system but not in bacteria, possessed acetyltransferase
activity for a synthetic histone substrate, free core histones, and
oligonucleosomal substrates. Deletion analysis indicated that the
C-terminal third of Ncoat had histone acetyltransferase activity.
Toleman et al., 2004 suggested that NCOAT may play a dual role in gene
expression by removing O-GlcNAc modification from activators, while
adding acetyl groups to histones.

GENE STRUCTURE

Comtesse et al. (2001) determined that the MGEA5 gene contains 16 exons
and spans over 34 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the MGEA5
gene to chromosome 10. By somatic cell hybridization and FISH, Heckel et
al. (1998) mapped the gene to 10q24.1-q24.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Forsythe et al. (2006) created a strain of C. elegans with knockout of
Oga1, the nematode homolog of Mgea5. Oga1 knockout altered serine- and
threonine-phosphoprotein profiles and increased GSK3B (605004) levels.
Mutant worms showed elevated stores of glycogen and trehalose and
decreased lipid storage.

;;SEC14, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 4;;
TOCOPHEROL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; TAP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis of the region surrounding human SEC14L2 (607558),
followed by RT-PCR analysis of human lung total RNA, Kempna et al.
(2003) cloned SEC14L3 (612824) and SEC14L4, which they called TAP2 and
TAP3, respectively. The 406-amino acid SEC14L4 protein has a conserved
CRAL/TRIO domain and shares 80% similarity with SEC14L2. All 3 proteins
share residues glu185 and lys216, which are predicted to play a role in
phospholipid binding and transfer activity in S. cerevisiae Sec14.
RT-PCR of human tissues and cell lines detected high SEC14L4 expression
in all tissues examined. Immunocytochemical studies localized SEC14L4 to
intracellular membranes of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells, including
partial localization to the ER and Golgi, with more intense staining
surrounding but not within the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Kempna et al. (2003) showed that in HeLa cells deletion of the
C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain changed SEC14L4 localization
with decreased staining surrounding the nucleus and a more dispersed
staining throughout the cell. They suggested that the SEC14L4 GOLD
domain may play a role in docking to other proteins or in intracellular
transport of bound ligands. Using several assays, Kempna et al. (2003)
demonstrated that SEC14L3 bound tocopherol, squalene, and phospholipids
(phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol).
Although SEC14L4 bound phospholipids, it failed to complement an S.
cerevisiae temperature-sensitive Sec14 allele in yeast. Using
immunoprecipitation assays, Kempna et al. (2003) showed that SEC14L4 may
interact with and regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and
that SEC14L4 displayed low basal GTPase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kempna et al. (2003) determined that the SEC14L4 gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Kempna et al. (2003) mapped the SEC14L4 gene to
chromosome 22q12.1-qter, where it lies within 100 kb of the SEC14L2 and
SEC14L3 genes.

;;ALPHA-KLOTHO
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kuro-o et al. (1997) cloned a mouse gene, which they called klotho (Kl),
from a transgenic mouse model with several age-related disorders. The
name of the gene, Klotho, is that of the Fate in Greek mythology who
spins the thread of life. By screening human kidney and hippocampus cDNA
libraries with a mouse Kl cDNA fragment at low stringency, Matsumura et
al. (1998) isolated cDNA clones for human klotho. Sequence analysis of
the cDNAs revealed that they encode 2 different transcripts. One
transcript encodes a putative 1,012-amino acid single-pass membrane
protein with an N-terminal signal sequence, an extracellular domain with
2 internal repeats, and a short intracellular domain, as found in the
mouse klotho protein by Kuro-o et al. (1997). Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of a single 5.2-kb transcript in kidney, placenta,
small intestine, and prostate. The other transcript contains a 50-bp
insertion encoding a truncated putative secreted protein of 549 amino
acids that lacks the second internal repeat, the transmembrane domain,
and the intracellular domain. Genomic sequence analysis showed that the
2 transcripts arise by alternative RNA splicing. By RNase protection
analysis, the secreted form predominated in all tissues examined, i.e.,
brain, hippocampus, placenta, kidney, prostate, and small intestine.

GENE STRUCTURE

Matsumura et al. (1998) determined that the KL gene contains 5 exons and
spans approximately 50 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Kuro-o et al. (1997) mapped the human KL gene to chromosome 13q12 by
FISH and by inclusion within a BAC contig.

reminiscent of the phenotype observed in Kl mutant mice. By RNase
protection, immunoblot, and immunohistochemical analyses, Koh et al.
(2001) observed severely reduced KL mRNA expression and protein
production in kidneys of CRF patients. They proposed that decreased KL
expression may be one of the factors underlying the degenerative
processes (e.g., arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, and skin atrophy) seen
in CRF.

Chang et al. (2005) reported that the transient receptor potential ion
channel TRPV5 (606679) is stimulated by the mammalian hormone klotho.
Klotho, a beta-glucuronidase, hydrolyzes extracellular sugar residues on
TRPV5, entrapping the channel in the plasma membrane. This maintains
durable calcium channel activity and membrane calcium permeability in
kidney. Thus, Chang et al. (2005) concluded that klotho activates a cell
surface channel by hydrolysis of its extracellular N-linked
oligosaccharides.

Urakawa et al. (2006) demonstrated that a previously undescribed
receptor conversion by Klotho generates the FGF23 (605380) receptor.
Using a renal homogenate, Urakawa et al. (2006) found that Klotho binds
to FGF23. Forced expression of Klotho enabled the high affinity binding
of FGF23 to the cell surface and restored the ability of a renal cell
line to respond to FGF23 treatment. Moreover, FGF23 incompetence was
induced by injecting wildtype mice with an anti-Klotho monoclonal
antibody. Thus, Klotho is essential for endogenous FGF23 function.
Because Klotho alone seemed to be incapable of intracellular signaling,
Urakawa et al. (2006) searched for other components of the FGF23
receptor and found FGFR1(IIIc) (see 136350), which was directly
converted by Klotho into the FGF23 receptor. Thus, the concerted action
of Klotho and FGFR1(IIIc) reconstitutes the FGF23 receptor. The FGF23
receptor shows a strong affinity, one that is sufficient for interacting
with physiologic concentrations of FGF23. Moreover, the tissue-specific
unique biologic activity of FGF23 is likely to be regulated by a limited
local distribution of Klotho. Urakawa et al. (2006) suggested that given
that Klotho, with its homologs beta-klotho (KLB; 611135) and KLPH, forms
a family, other FGF-FGFR systems may be subject to similar conversions.

Urakawa et al. (2006) suggested that Klotho may convert other members of
the FGF/FGFR receptor system.

Imura et al. (2007) found the molecular association of Klotho (referred
to as alpha-Klotho) and Na+,K+ ATPase and provided evidence for an
increase of abundance of Na+,K+ ATPase at the plasma membrane. Low
concentrations of extracellular free calcium rapidly induced regulated
parathyroid hormone (168450) secretion in an alpha-Klotho-Na+,K+
ATPase-dependent manner. The authors suggested that the increased sodium
ion gradient created by Na+,K+ ATPase activity might drive the
transepithelial transport of calcium in cooperation with ion channels
and transporters in the choroid plexus and kidney. Imura et al. (2007)
concluded that their findings revealed fundamental roles of alpha-Klotho
in the regulation of calcium metabolism.

Chen et al. (2007) found that ADAM10 (602192) and ADAM17 (603639)
mediated shedding of Klotho from cell membranes of Klotho-transfected
COS-7 cells, a model system they validated by studies in rat kidney
slices. Insulin enhanced Klotho shedding, and this effect was abolished
by silencing of ADAM10 or ADAM17. Insulin appeared to stimulate ADAM10
and ADAM17 proteolytic activity toward Klotho, but did not increase
their mRNA or protein levels.

CYTOGENETICS

In a 23-year-old woman with hypophosphatemic rickets and
hyperparathyroidism (612089), Brownstein et al. (2008) identified a de
novo balanced translocation t(9;13)(q21.13;q13.1). The authors mapped
the translocation breakpoints and found that the 5-prime end of the
KLOTHO gene was -49 kb distal to the breakpoint on chromosome 13. Plasma
alpha-klotho levels and beta-glucuronidase activity were markedly
increased in the patient, as was circulating FGF23. Brownstein et al.
(2008) concluded that the patient's novel phenotype was caused by a
positional effect of the translocation, causing increased levels of
alpha-klotho.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a population-based association study, Arking et al. (2002) determined
that allele 17 of microsatellite marker 1, which is 11 kb 3-prime of the
last exon of the KL gene, is significantly more prevalent in Bohemian
Czech newborns than in individuals more than 75 years old, independent
of sex and health status. SSCP analysis identified another KL allele,
which the authors termed KL-VS, defined by the presence of 6
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an 800-bp region spanning exon
2 and flanking sequence. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization
analysis showed complete linkage disequilibrium for the coding region
mutations. Of the 3 mutations in exon 2, 1 is silent and 2 encode amino
acid changes, phe352 to val (F352V) and cys370 to ser (C370S). The F352V
mutation occurs at a completely conserved amino acid. Genotype analysis
indicated that heterozygosity for F352V is significantly more prevalent
in elderly Bohemians than in newborns, while homozygosity for V352,
which is rare, is more prevalent in newborns. Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis revealed that the heterozygote advantage promotes not only
survival but also longevity (152430) in elderly individuals more than 80
years old. Analysis of Caucasians and African Americans in Baltimore did
not detect a heterozygote advantage for F352V, but did find decreased
V352 homozygosity in the elderly. Western blot analysis of expression of
the V352, S370, V352/S370, and wildtype alleles in HeLa cells or
fibroblasts showed enhanced secretion of S370 mutant and decreased
secretion of V352 variant compared with the 65-kD wildtype protein. The
double mutant was secreted at intermediate levels, and the V352 mutant
was most abundant intracellularly, suggesting a KL secretion defect.
Functional analysis of a KL paralog, cytosolic beta-glucosidase (CBGL1;
606619), which has a known substrate, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside,
established that a mutation (F289V) at the position in CBGL1
corresponding to KL F352V results in a complete loss of ability to
cleave the substrate. Arking et al. (2002) concluded that the KL-VS
mutation impairs the trafficking and catalytic activity of KL, which may
in turn contribute to differences in the onset and severity of
age-related phenotypes. They also suggested that additional deleterious
mutations remained to be identified, since KL-VS is found on multiple
marker allele haplotypes and is negatively associated with marker 1
allele 17.

Kuro-o et al. (1997) found that klotho-deficient mice display extensive
and accelerated arteriosclerosis in association with medial
calcification of the aorta and both medial calcification and intimal
thickening of medium-sized muscular arteries. To determine whether
klotho influences atherosclerotic risk in humans, Arking et al. (2003)
performed cross-sectional studies to assess the association between the
KL-VS allele and adult coronary artery disease (CAD) in 2 independent
samples of apparently healthy sibs of individuals with onset of CAD
under the age of 60 years. Analysis incorporating known CAD risk factors
demonstrated that the KL-VS allele is an independent risk factor and
that the imposed risk of KL-VS allele status is influenced by modifiable
risk factors. Hypertension and increasing high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels masked or reduced the risk conferred by the KL-VS
allele, respectively, whereas current smoking increased the risk. The
results demonstrated that the KL-VS allele is an independent risk factor
for occult CAD in 2 independent high-risk samples. Modifiable risk
factors, including hypertension, smoking status, and HDL cholesterol
level, appear to influence the risk imposed by this allele.

Priapism, a vasoocclusive manifestation of sickle cell disease (603903),
affects more than 30% of males with the disorder. In sickle cell anemia
patients, 148 with priapism and 529 without, Nolan et al. (2004)
searched SNPs from 44 genes of different functional classes for an
association with priapism. By genotypic and haplotype analysis, they
found an association between SNPs in the KL gene and priapism (dbSNP
rs2249358 and dbSNP rs211239; adjusted odds ratio of 2.6 and 1.7,
respectively).

In a 13-year-old girl with hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis
(211900), Ichikawa et al. (2007) identified a homozygous mutation in the
KL gene (604824.0002). In vitro functional expression studies showed
that the mutation led to decreased complex formation with FGF23 and to
decreased FGF23 signaling.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kuro-o et al. (1997) described a transgenic mouse with several
age-related disorders: infertility, genital and thymus atrophy, skin
atrophy as revealed by a reduction in hair follicle number,
arteriosclerosis, hypokinesis, gait disturbance, ectopic calcification,
osteoporosis, emphysema, pituitary abnormalities, and increases in serum
calcium and phosphorus. The phenotypes appeared only in mice homozygous
for the mutant Kl transgene and only after at least 2 weeks of age. The
average life span of the mice was approximately 60 days with no mice
surviving more than 100 days. Mice with the normal Kl gene did not
express the age-related disorders.

Manya et al. (2002) showed that, while calpain-1 (114220) activity was
unchanged in kidneys of klotho-null mice, the activity of calpain-2
(114230) was elevated, and the activity of its endogenous inhibitor,
calpastatin (114090), was significantly decreased. Proteolysis of
alpha-II spectrin (182860) also increased with decreasing levels of
klotho protein. Manya et al. (2002) observed similar phenomena in normal
aged mice.

Using the Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat model of
atherosclerotic disease, Saito et al. (2000) observed significantly
reduced levels of klotho mRNA in the kidneys of these animals. Saito et
al. (2000) established that adenovirus-mediated klotho gene delivery
improves endothelial dysfunction, increases nitric oxide production, and
reduces elevated blood pressure to control rat levels, but does not have
a detectable effect on weight or blood glucose levels. Klotho treatment
also suppresses the medial thickness of the thoracic aorta and
perivascular fibrosis in the coronary artery.

Mori et al. (2000) showed that klotho mice had a barely detectable
amount of white adipose tissue, whereas brown adipose tissue (BAT) was
comparably preserved. Although klotho mice consumed as much food as
wildtype mice when normalized for body weight, they exhibited changes in
parameters for energy homeostasis similar to those found under
food-restricted conditions. The klotho mice had increased glucose
tolerance and insulin sensitivity, as well as increased hepatic Pepck
(261680) expression. Levels of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1; 113730) and
body temperature were significantly lower in klotho mice. Histologic
analysis demonstrated lower glycogen, insulin, and lipid in the liver,
pancreas, and BAT, respectively.

Fukino et al. (2002) found that mice heterozygously deficient for the
klotho gene showed impaired blood flow recovery and impaired
angiogenesis following ischemic hindlimb injury.

Bektas et al. (2004) sequenced the mouse klotho gene and examined renal
expression of the secreted and membrane-bound klotho isoforms from 16
laboratory-derived and 4 wild-derived inbred strains. Among the
laboratory-derived strains, no sequence variation was found in any of
the exons or intron-exon boundaries. Among the wild-derived strains,
they found 45 sequence variants with 6 resulting in amino acid
substitutions. One wild-derived strain, SPRET/Ei, had 4 amino acid
substitutions and higher levels of the membrane form and total klotho
mRNA. These mice had longer life spans, decreased atherosclerosis risk
factors, and better hearing than almost all other mouse strains.

Kurosu et al. (2005) showed that overexpression of klotho in mice
extends life span. Klotho protein functions as a circulating hormone
that binds to a cell surface receptor and represses intracellular
signals of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1; 147440), an
evolutionarily conserved mechanism for extending life span. Alleviation
of aging-like phenotypes in klotho-deficient mice was observed by
perturbing insulin and IGF1 signaling, suggesting that klotho-mediated
inhibition of insulin and IGF1 signaling contributes to its anti-aging
properties. Kurosu et al. (2005) suggested that klotho protein may
function as an anti-aging hormone in mammals.

In a Tenc1 (607717)-mutant mouse model of glomerulonephritis (ICGN),
Haruna et al. (2007) introduced a Klotho transgene and found that
overexpression of the Klotho gene resulted in a 70% survival rate
compared to 30% for ICGN mice without the Klotho transgene. Survival was
associated with dramatic improvement in renal functions, morphologic
lesions, and cytochrome c oxidase activity, as well reduced
beta-galactosidase (see 230500) activity, mitochondrial DNA
fragmentation, superoxide anion generation, lipid peroxidation, and Bax
(600004) protein expression and apoptosis. Improvement was seen in both
the tubular and glomerular compartments of the kidney, suggesting that
the Klotho gene product may serve as a renoprotective circulating
hormone while mitigating mitochondrial oxidative stress.

Liu et al. (2007) explored the contribution of stem and progenitor cell
dysfunction and depletion to aging in the Klotho mouse model. Analysis
of various tissues and organs from young Klotho mice revealed a decrease
in stem cell number and an increase in progenitor cell senescence.
Because Klotho is a secreted protein, Liu et al. (2007) postulated that
Klotho might interact with other soluble mediators of stem cells. They
found that Klotho bound to various Wnt family members. In a cell culture
model, the Wnt-Klotho interaction resulted in the suppression of Wnt
biologic activity. Tissues and organs from Klotho-deficient animals
showed evidence of increased Wnt signaling, and ectopic expression of
Klotho antagonized the activity of endogenous and exogenous Wnt. Both in
vitro and in vivo, continuous Wnt exposure triggered accelerated
cellular senescence. Thus, Liu et al. (2007) concluded that Klotho
appears to be a secreted Wnt antagonist and that Wnt proteins have an
unexpected role in mammalian aging.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
KL, KL-VS HAPLOTYPE

Arking et al. (2002) identified a functional variant of klotho, a
haplotype termed KL-VS, which is defined by the presence of 6
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an 800-bp region spanning exon
2 and flanking sequence. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization
analysis showed complete linkage disequilibrium for the coding region
mutations. Of the 3 mutations in exon 2, 1 is silent and 2 encode amino
acid changes, phe352 to val (F352V) and cys370 to ser (C370S). The
variant was associated with reduced human longevity when in
homozygosity. The prevalence of the variant in the general population
was estimated to be 0.157.

Arking et al. (2003) demonstrated an association between the variant
allele and susceptibility to coronary artery disease that proved to be a
risk factor independent of known risk factors. The authors found,
however, that the risk imposed by KL-VS was influenced by other risk
factors, including hypertension, smoking status, and HDL cholesterol
level.

.0002
TUMORAL CALCINOSIS, HYPERPHOSPHATEMIC
KL, HIS193ARG

In a 13-year-old girl with hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis
(211900), Ichikawa et al. (2007) identified a homozygous 578A-G
transition in exon 1 of the KL gene, resulting in a his193-to-arg
(H193R) substitution in the first of 2 tandem putative glycosidase
domains. The substitution was predicted to destabilize the tertiary fold
of the glycosidase domain, leading to decreased expression and secretion
of the protein. In vitro functional expression studies indicated that
the H193R mutant protein was not fully glycosylated, was not fully
secreted, and had decreased stability compared to wildtype. In addition,
the mutation led to decreased complex formation with FGF23 (605380) and
to decreased FGF23 signaling. The patient had hyperphosphatemia,
increased serum vitamin D, tumoral calcinosis in the dura, and
osteopenia. She also had hyperparathyroidism due to hyperplastic glands;
the relationship of this feature to the KL mutation was unclear.

605799	TITLE *605799 AMNIONLESS, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; AMN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Amn gene, mutant in the 'amnionless' mouse, encodes a type I
transmembrane protein that is expressed exclusively in the
extraembryonic visceral endoderm layer during gastrulation.

CLONING

Fate-mapping experiments in the mouse have revealed that the primitive
streak can be divided into 3 functional regions: the proximal region
gives rise to the germ cells and the extraembryonic mesoderm of the yolk
sac; the distal region generates cardiac mesoderm and node-derived axial
mesendoderm; and the middle streak region produces the paraxial,
intermediate, and lateral plate mesoderm of the trunk. To gain insight
into the mechanisms that mediate the assembly of the primitive streak
into these functional regions, Kalantry et al. (2001) cloned and
functionally identified the gene disrupted in the amnionless mouse,
which has a recessive embryonic lethal mutation that interferes
specifically with the formation and/or specification of the middle
primitive streak region during gastrulation. The extracellular region of
the Amn protein contains a cysteine-rich domain with similarity to bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP)-binding cysteine-rich domains in chordin
(603475), its Drosophila homolog 'short gastrulation' (Sog), and
procollagen IIA (120140). Alignment of the predicted amino acid
sequences of the Drosophila, human, and mouse genes indicate that the
N-terminal portion, together with the cysteine-rich module, is the most
conserved segment of AMN. Amn acts in the visceral endoderm to affect
cell behaviors in the adjacent epiblast. The apical location of Amn
places it on the opposite side of the visceral endoderm from the
epiblast; therefore, Amn is unlikely to interact directly with epiblast
cells. Kalantry et al. (2001) proposed that AMN modulates a BMP
signaling pathway within the visceral endoderm to direct the production
of a set of gene products that interact directly with epiblast cells and
influence their behavior. Unlike chordin and Sog, AMN is
transmembrane-bound. This indicates that AMN might modulate BMP receptor
function by serving as an accessory or coreceptor that, through its
cysteine-rich domain, facilitates or hinders BMP binding.

The human AMN gene is predicted to encode a 454-amino acid protein
(Kalantry et al., 2001).

Dunn and Hogan (2001) discussed the work of Kalantry et al. (2001) in
the context of the role of extraembryonic signals in embryonic
patterning.

Tanner et al. (2003) determined that the AMN gene comprises 12 exons
encoding at least 5 protein products.

GENE FUNCTION

Fyfe et al. (2004) showed that cubilin (CUBN; 602997), a protein that
recognizes intrinsic factor (IF)-cobalamin and various other proteins to
be endocytosed in the intestine and kidney, respectively, and AMN
colocalize in the endocytic apparatus of polarized epithelial cells and
copurify as a tight complex during IF-cobalamin affinity and
nondenaturing gel filtration chromatography. In transfected cells
expressing either AMN or a truncated IF-cobalamin-binding cubilin
construct, neither protein alone conferred ligand endocytosis. Other
studies indicated that cubilin and AMN are subunits of a novel
cubilin/AMN (cubam) complex, where AMN binds to the N-terminal third of
cubilin and directs subcellular localization and endocytosis of cubilin
with its ligand. Fyfe et al. (2004) concluded that mutations affecting
either of the 2 proteins may abrogate function of the cubam complex and
cause Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome (261100).

MAPPING

Kalantry et al. (2001) assembled an EST contig corresponding to the
human AMN gene. By sequence identity between this contig and a BAC clone
(GenBank GENBANK AL133455), they mapped the human AMN gene to 14q32. AMN
resides between TRAF3 (601896) and CDC42BPB (614062), in the same
transcriptional orientation as TRAF3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Autosomal recessive hereditary megaloblastic anemia (MGA1; 261100) was
described simultaneously in Norway by Imerslund (1960) and in Finland by
Grasbeck et al. (1960). Aminoff et al. (1999) showed that MGA1 is caused
in Finnish cases by homozygous mutations of the CUBN gene, which encodes
a receptor for the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex. Unexpectedly,
however, Norwegian individuals showing the MGA1 phenotype did not have
mutations in CUBN. Using samples from these Norwegian families, Tanner
et al. (2003) carried out a genomewide search, established linkage to
14q, and narrowed the critical region to that containing the AMN gene.
AMN emerged as a clear candidate because of its high expression in the
kidney. Tanner et al. (2003) screened the AMN gene in 5 families and
identified homozygosity for one or another of 3 AMN mutations in all 11
affected individuals, with heterozygosity in the 5 parents available for
study.

It is a paradox that homozygous inactivation of Amn causes an embryonic
lethal condition in mice, whereas homozygous mutations in human AMN
cause only the mild MGA1 phenotype. As all mutations resulting in MGA1
occurred toward the N-terminal end of the gene, this part of the gene
might not be essential for embryonic development but might be for
vitamin B12 uptake. By in vitro protein expression analysis, Tanner et
al. (2003) showed that the AMN gene encodes at least 5 protein products.
Further studies confirmed that the MGA1 mutations allowed truncated AMN
translation. The authors postulated that the truncated AMN products are
important for embryonic development and thereby preclude a lethal
phenotype as seen in the amnionless mouse.

Evidence of mutations in a single gene, such as AMN, causing 2 or more
distinct phenotypes is an exception to the dogma of 1 gene, 1 protein, 1
function. Thus, AMN/Amn can be added to the short list of 'moonlighting
proteins' (Jeffery, 1999). Other examples include laminin A/C (LMNA;
150330), mutations in which cause related phenotypes that suggest a
common mechanism; a notable example is ERCC2 (126340), which apparently
has 2 distinct functions in DNA repair and transcription and causes 3
distinct diseases (Lehmann, 2001) when mutated.

ANIMAL MODEL

The mouse mutation 'amnionless' was originally so named because on some
genetic backgrounds homozygotes lack the amnion (Wang et al., 1996;
Tomihara-Newberger et al., 1998). More striking, however, is that Amn
mutants lack a trunk. Embryos that survive to the tenth day of
gastrulation have headfolds, a beating heart, and abundant posterior
mesoderm; however, in between these tissues is none of the mesoderm that
produces the limb buds, dermis, muscle, vertebrae, and other organs of
the trunk (Tomihara-Newberger et al., 1998). Analysis of marker genes
expressed regionally indicates that the phenotype originates from
mispatterning of epiblast cells in the middle levels so that they
acquire a more posterior fate. The Amn mouse has an insertional mutation
generated by the integration of a human CD8-alpha transgene into distal
mouse chromosome 12, downstream from the 3-prime end of Traf3 (601896).
By in situ hybridization analysis of wildtype blastocysts and early
postimplantation-stage embryos, Kalantry et al. (2001) demonstrated that
Amn is first transcribed in the primitive endoderm at embryonic day 4.5.
Amn expression was specifically in the visceral endoderm at all
subsequent stages of gastrulation examined. The Amn protein is localized
to the apical surface of the visceral endoderm cells at embryonic day
6.0 and 7.5. A similar distribution of Amn was detected at embryonic day
5.5; in particular, Amn is expressed throughout the visceral endoderm
and is not localized to either the posterior or anterior side of the
embryo. The expression pattern indicates that Amn functions exclusively
in the visceral endoderm to direct epiblast growth and assembly of the
middle primitive streak.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA 1, NORWEGIAN TYPE
AMN, 1-BP DEL, 14G

In 3 Norwegian families with recessive hereditary megaloblastic anemia
(261100), Tanner et al. (2003) found deletion of nucleotide 14 in exon 1
(14delG) of the AMN gene, leading to termination at codon 16.

.0002
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA 1, NORWEGIAN TYPE
AMN, THR41ILE

In a Norwegian family, Tanner et al. (2003) found that megaloblastic
anemia (261100) was associated with a C-to-T transition at nucleotide
122 in exon 2 (122C-T) of the AMN gene, predicted to result in a
threonine-to-isoleucine substitution (T41I). The substitution changed
the side chain from polar to nonpolar. Residue 41 is 100% conserved in
human, mouse, and rat homologs.

.0003
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA 1
AMN, IVS3, A-G, -2

In a Tunisian Jewish family with megaloblastic anemia (261100), Tanner
et al. (2003) found that the disorder was associated with a change from
CAG to CGG in the acceptor splice site of intron 3 (208-2A-G) of the AMN
gene. RT-PCR analysis showed that this splice mutation caused complete
skipping of exon 4 (88 bp) with a subsequent frameshift and premature
termination in exon 6. This and the other 2 mutations found by Tanner et
al. (2003) were homozygous in all 11 affected individuals from 5
families and heterozygous in the 5 parents available for study.

Bouchlaka et al. (2007) reported a Tunisian family with MGA1 caused by
the 208-2A-G mutation. Since the mutation had been previously reported
in a Jewish Israeli family of Tunisian origin and in Turkish families,
the authors suggested a founder effect originating in the Mediterranean
basin.

604661	TITLE *604661 POTASSIUM CHANNEL-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2; KCNIP2
;;KCHIP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the brain and heart, rapidly inactivating (A-type) voltage-gated
potassium (Kv) currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to
control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes. An et al.
(2000) described 3 Kv channel-interacting proteins called KCHIPs that
bind to the cytoplasmic amino termini of Kv4-alpha subunits. See KCHIP1
(604660). The KCHIP2 cDNA encodes a 252-amino acid protein that has a
distinct amino terminus but shares approximately 70% amino acid identity
with KCHIP1 and KCHIP3 throughout a carboxy-terminal 185-amino acid core
domain containing 4 EF-hand-like motifs. Expression of KCHIP2 and Kv4
together reconstituted several features of native A-type currents by
modulating the density, inactivation kinetics, and rate of recovery from
inactivation of Kv4 channels in heterologous cells. The KCHIPs
colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with brain Kv4-alpha subunits and
are thus integral components of native Kv4 channel complexes.

GENE FUNCTION

Jeyaraj et al. (2012) provided molecular evidence that links circadian
rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice.
Specifically, they showed that cardiac ion channel expression and QT
interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit
endogenous circadian rhythmicity under the control of a clock-dependent
oscillator, Kruppel-like factor-15 (KLF15; 606465). Klf15
transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of KChIP2, a critical
subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current.
Deficiency or excess of Klf15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation,
abnormal repolarization, and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular
arrhythmias. Jeyaraj et al. (2012) concluded that their findings
identified circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for
cardiac arrhythmogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kuo et al. (2001) found that knockout mice deficient for Kchip2
exhibited normal cardiac structure and function but displayed a
prolonged elevation in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. The
Kchip2 -/- mice were highly susceptible to the induction of cardiac
arrhythmias. Single-cell analysis revealed a substrate for
arrhythmogenesis, including a complete absence of transient outward
potassium current (I-to) and a marked increase in action potential
duration. These studies demonstrated that a defect in KCHIP2 is
sufficient to confer a marked genetic susceptibility to arrhythmias,
establishing a novel genetic pathway for ventricular tachycardia via a
loss of the transmural gradient of I-to.

611687	TITLE *611687 KHDC3-LIKE PROTEIN, SUBCORTICAL MATERNAL COMPLEX MEMBER; KHDC3L
;;CHROMOSOME 6 OPEN READING FRAME 221; C6ORF221;;
EMBRYONIC STEM CELL-ASSOCIATED TRANSCRIPT 1; ECAT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes similar to the 3 mouse Khdc1 genes, Pierre et al.
(2007) identified a family of related genes in eutherian mammals. In
humans, this family includes KHDC1 (611688), DPPA5 (611111), OOEP
(611689), and ECAT1 (KHDC3L), which is absent in rodents. The proteins
encoded by these genes contain an atypical KH domain with amino acid
changes at critical sites, suggesting that it may not bind RNA like
canonical KH domains.

Parry et al. (2011) investigated the expression of C6ORF221 by using
RT-PCR on amplified cDNA derived from a developmental series of staged
human ovarian follicles, oocytes, preimplantation embryos, and human
blastocysts. Expression appeared to be maximal in germinal vesicle
oocytes, tapering off through metaphase II oocytes, and becoming
undetectable following the completion of the oocyte to embryo
transition. Parry et al. (2011) noted that this temporal pattern of
expression is similar to that reported for NLRP7 (609661) and is typical
of the expression reported for oocyte-specific genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Pierre et al. (2007) mapped the ECAT1 gene
to chromosome 6q13.

EVOLUTION

Pierre et al. (2007) identified a family of KHDC1-related genes,
including ECAT1, in eutherian mammals, but not in fish, bird, or
opossum. These genes map to a single syntenic region in human,
chimpanzee, macaque, dog, and bovine, but a paracentric inversion
separated the genes in mouse and rat. Pierre et al. (2007) noted that
the ECAT1 gene is absent in rodents.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a multiply consanguineous Pakistani family with recurrent biparental
complete hydatidiform mole (HYDM2; 614293) that did not map to the known
locus on chromosome 19q (HYDM1; 231090), Parry et al. (2011) performed a
homozygosity scan and identified a mutation in the initiation codon of
the C6ORF221 gene (611687.0001) that segregated with disease in the
family and was not found in 328 ethnically matched control chromosomes.
By sequencing of C6ORF221 in 14 additional probands with recurrent
hydatidiform mole who were known to be negative for mutation in the
NLRP7 gene (609661) on chromosome 19q, Parry et al. (2011) identified
mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous state in 2
(611687.0002-611687.0003).

Fallahian et al. (2013) performed genetic analysis of tissue from the
fourth complete hydatidiform mole (CHM) pregnancy of the woman in whom
Parry et al. (2011) had identified compound heterozygosity for mutations
in the KDHC3L gene (see 611687.0002), and detected 1 nonmaternal and 2
maternal alleles, consistent with a digynic triploid conceptus. The
proband's sister, who was also compound heterozygous for the KDHC3L
mutations, had undergone 2 CHM pregnancies; genotyping of the second CHM
showed that it was a biparental CHM, with both a maternal and paternal
contribution to the genome. Fallahian et al. (2013) stated that these
findings were consistent with a role for KDHC3L in setting and/or
maintaining the maternal imprint.

In affected individuals from a multiply consanguineous Pakistani family
with recurrent biparental complete hydatidiform mole (HYDM2; 614293),
previously studied by Judson et al. (2002), Parry et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 3G-T transversion in the initiation codon
of the C6ORF221 gene, predicted to change ATG to ATT. Functional
analysis in HEK293 cells confirmed production of a shortened protein,
consistent with initiation of the mutant protein at the next available
ATG at position 14. The mutation segregated with disease in the family
and was not found in 328 ethnically matched control chromosomes.

In the proband from a Tunisian family with recurrent biparental complete
hydatidiform mole (HYDM2; 614293), previously studied by Landolsi et al.
(2011), Parry et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion
(322delGACT) in exon 2 of the C6ORF221 gene, causing a frameshift and
resulting in premature termination after 29 novel amino acids. The
mutation was not found in 208 Tunisian control chromosomes. In a proband
of Asian origin with biparental recurrent hydatidiform mole, previously
studied by Wang et al. (2009), Parry et al. (2011) identified compound
heterozygosity for the 4-bp deletion and a 1A-G transition in the
initiation codon of the C6ORF221 gene (611687.0003). Neither mutation
was found in more than 1,100 individuals for whom a genotype could be
called in the 1000 Genomes Project.

Fallahian et al. (2013) performed genetic analysis of tissue from the
fourth complete hydatidiform mole pregnancy of the woman previously
studied by Wang et al. (2009), in whom Parry et al. (2011) had
identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the KDHC3L gene.
Although DNA was unavailable from her partner, 2 alleles were maternal
in origin and a third allele was nonmaternal, consistent with a digynic
triploid conceptus. The proband had 1 sister with 3 normal pregnancies,
but another sister, who was also compound heterozygous for the KDHC3L
mutations, had undergone 2 CHM pregnancies; genotyping of the second CHM
showed that it was a biparental CHM, with both a maternal and paternal
contribution to the genome.

613357	TITLE *613357 FIBRINOGEN C DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; FIBCD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FIBCD1 is a conserved type II transmembrane endocytic receptor that
binds chitin and is located primarily in the intestinal brush border
(Schlosser et al., 2009).

CLONING

By searching databases for L-ficolin (FCN2; 601624) homologs that might
bind acetyl groups, Schlosser et al. (2009) identified human FIBCD1. The
predicted 461-amino acid protein has a 31-amino acid cytoplasmic tail at
its N terminus, followed by a 23-amino acid transmembrane helix and a
408-amino acid ectodomain. The cytoplasmic tail has 2 potential
phosphorylation sites. The ectodomain contains an acetyl group-binding
fibrinogen (see 134820)-related domain (FRED) and sequences with
homology to coiled-coil regions of myosins (see 601478) and
angiopoietins (see 601667). FIBCD1 shares significant homology with
FCN2, M-ficolin (FCN1; 601252), and horseshoe crab tachylectin-5A
(Tl5a). When expressed in HEK293 cells as a secreted protein, the FIBCD1
ectodomain had a molecular mass of 55 kD in the reduced state and 250 kD
in the unreduced state by SDS-PAGE, and chemical cross-linking
experiments showed that it formed disulfide-linked homotetramers. FACS
analysis and confocal microscopy of transfected Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells showed cell surface localization of full-length FIBCD1.
RT-PCR detected FIBCD1 mRNA in nearly all human tissues examined.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human tissues demonstrated high
expression of FIBCD1 in small and large intestine epithelial cells on
the apical surface corresponding to the brush border and in salivary
gland ducts. Little to no expression was detected in stomach epithelial
cells, respiratory cells, and urogenital epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using ELISA and fluorescence microscopy analysis, Schlosser et al.
(2009) showed that human FIBCD1 could bind to and mediate uptake of
acetylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a manner that depended on
calcium or manganese, but not magnesium. Pull-down analysis revealed
that FIBCD1 bound chitin, but not other pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs). Schlosser et al. (2009) concluded that FIBCD1 is a
membrane-bound FRED molecule that binds chitin.

By chemical cross-linking and electron microscopy analyses, Thomsen et
al. (2010) showed that FIBCD1 FREDs formed noncovalent tetramers
independent of the coiled-coil. Using surface plasmon resonance and
pull-down assays with mutation analysis, they found that the central
residues in the hydrophobic funnel were necessary for binding of FIBCD1
to acetylated BSA and chitin. Thomsen et al. (2010) concluded that
FIBCD1 FREDs form noncovalent tetramers with an acetyl-binding site
homologous to those of Tl5a and FCN1, but not to that of FCN2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schlosser et al. (2009) determined that the FIBCD1 gene contains 7 exons
and spans 36 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Schlosser et al. (2009) mapped the FIBCD1
gene to chromosome 9q34.12-q34.13.

607281	TITLE *607281 LSM1 PROTEIN; LSM1
;;CANCER-ASSOCIATED SM-LIKE PROTEIN; CASM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sm-like proteins, such as LSM1, were identified in a variety of
organisms based on sequence homology with the Sm protein family (see
SNRPD2; 601061). Sm-like proteins contain the Sm sequence motif, which
consists of 2 regions separated by a linker of variable length that
folds as a loop. Sm-like proteins are thought to form a stable heteromer
present in tri-snRNP particles, which are important for pre-mRNA
splicing (Achsel et al., 1999). LSM1 localizes to cytoplasmic processing
bodies (P bodies) involved in mRNA storage, processing, regulation, and
degradation and is required for P-body formation (Scheller et al.,
2007).

CLONING

LSM1 was first isolated from human pancreatic cancers as an upregulated
gene and termed 'cancer-associated Sm-like protein' (CASM) by
Schweinfest et al. (1997). The deduced LSM1 protein contains 133 amino
acids.

In a search for human Sm-like proteins, Achsel et al. (1999)
fractionated proteins present in purified (U4/U6.U5) tri-snRNPs and
isolated 7 Sm-like proteins, which they named LSm2-LSm8. Using partial
peptide sequence for database searches, they identified and sequenced
EST clones. Using additional sequence obtained by PCR amplification of a
HeLa cDNA library, they assembled full-length cDNA sequences for
LSM2-LSM8.

Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999) searched database sequence for Sm proteins
and identified 16 potential Sm-related genes in yeast as well as some
Sm-related genes in human and archaebacteria. Using a multiple sequence
alignment of Sm domains, they built a phylogenetic tree of yeast, human,
and archaeal Sm and Sm-like proteins.

Using Northern blot analysis, Scheller et al. (2007) detected variable
expression of a 0.95-kb LSM1 transcript in all human tissues examined.
In HeLa cells, LSM1 colocalized with PATL1 (614660), DCP1 (see 607010),
and RCK (DDX6; 600326) in cytoplasmic P bodies.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electron-microscopy, Achsel et al. (1999) observed that purified
LSm proteins form a heteromer that is stable even in the absence of RNA
and exhibits a doughnut-shaped structure similar to the Sm core RNP
structure. They demonstrated that the purified LSm heteromer binds
specifically to the U6 snRNA at its 3-prime-terminal U-tract. They also
showed that the LSm proteins facilitate the formation of U4/U6 RNA
duplexes in vitro and concluded that the LSm proteins may play a role in
U4/U6 snRNP formation.

Using immunoprecipitation experiments, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that there is a complex of 7 Sm-like proteins bound to RNA in
yeast. Lsm2-Lsm8 coprecipitate the U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs and directly
associate with the U6 snRNA present in the free U6 snRNP. Additionally,
the yeast Lsm2-Lsm7 proteins were found to be associated with the
pre-RNase P RNA but not the mature RNase RNA. Using immunoprecipitation
experiments from human cell extracts, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
showed that the LSM3 and LSM4 proteins are specifically associated with
snRNP complexes containing the U6 snRNA. Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that Sm and Sm-like proteins assemble in at least 2
functionally conserved complexes of deep evolutionary origin.

By disrupting the Sm and Sm-like genes in yeast, Salgado-Garrido et al.
(1999) concluded that disruption of genes encoding Sm-like proteins
directly associated with the U6 snRNA (Lsm2-8) generated variable
phenotypes. Lsm2, Lsm3, Lsm4, and Lsm8 are essential for vegetative
growth. Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 are not essential for growth; however,
their disruptions lead to slow growth especially at elevated
temperature. The levels of the U6 snRNA were strongly reduced in the
strains harboring the Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 disruptions. Lsm1 and Lsm9
are dispensable for vegetative growth, but Lsm1 is required for optimal
vegetative growth at 30 degrees and is temperature sensitive.

Ingelfinger et al. (2002) determined that human LSM1 to LSM7, but not
LSM8, were expressed in HeLa cells within cytoplasmic foci. The foci
also contained a decapping enzyme (DCP1/2) and the exonuclease XRN1
(607994). Coexpression of wildtype and mutant LSM proteins, as well as
fluorescence resonance energy transfer, indicated that the LSM proteins
form a complex similar to one found in yeast. Ingelfinger et al. (2002)
concluded that the foci contain a partially or fully assembled machinery
for the degradation of mRNA.

Using cDNA-representational difference analysis, Takahashi et al. (2002)
searched for genes differentially expressed in advanced prostate cancers
and thereby isolated the LSM1 gene as 1 that is downregulated. They
transfected an LSM1 expression vector into PC3 cells, which normally
feature downregulated LSM1. In the transfectants, no differences in
morphology or cell proliferation were evident in comparison with parent
PC3 or PC3/mock-transfectants. In contrast, significant suppression of
invasive potential or metastatic ability of LSM1 transfectants was
observed in the Matrigel chemoinvasion assay and in nude mice,
respectively. In studies of human prostate cancers, Takahashi et al.
(2002) found that almost all informative prostatectomized cases without
neoadjuvant therapy showed allelic retention in the LSM1 region, whereas
refractory cancers frequently showed allelic loss in this region. No
critical gene mutations were found in the open reading frame of LSM1 in
prostate cancers, including localized and refractory cancers. These
results suggested that LSM1 is deeply involved in prostate cancer
progression through its downregulation, independent of any gene
mutation.

By array CGH, Yang et al. (2006) analyzed the copy number and expression
level of genes in the 8p12-p11 amplicon in 22 human breast cancer
(114480) specimens and 7 breast cancer cell lines. Of the 21 potential
genes identified, PCR analysis and functional analysis indicated that 3
genes, LSM1, BAG4 (603884), and C8ORF4 (607702), are breast cancer
oncogenes that can work in combination to influence a transformed
phenotype in human mammary epithelial cells.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LSM1
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP stSG26021). Most of the genes encoding the
Lsm proteins map to different chromosomes.

606343	TITLE *606343 POLYMERASE, DNA, LAMBDA; POLL
DESCRIPTION DNA polymerases can participate in both replication of the genome and
DNA repair processes. The human genome contains multiple DNA polymerase
genes.

CLONING

By searching sequence databases to identify new members of the polX
family, Aoufouchi et al. (2000) identified EST clones representing 2 DNA
polymerases, POLM (606344) and POLL, which they called pol mu and pol
lambda, respectively. By screening bone marrow and lymph node cDNA
libraries, they isolated a full-length POLL cDNA. POLL encodes a deduced
575-amino acid protein predicted to contain a polX domain, a BRCA-1
C-terminal (BRCT) domain, and 2 helix-hairpin-helix (HHH) DNA-binding
motifs. POLL structurally resembles terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase
(TDT; 187410). It shares 34% amino acid identity with DNA polymerase
beta (POLB; 174760) and 82% identity with mouse Poll. Aoufouchi et al.
(2000) found that POLL has template-dependent DNA polymerase activity in
vitro. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.7-kb POLL transcript with
highest expression in testis and fetal liver and very weak expression in
many other tissues. They identified POLL splice variants which they
considered to be nonfunctional. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR
amplification, Aoufouchi et al. (2000) concluded that POLL mRNA
expression is downregulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner upon
cell exposure to DNA damaging agents.

Aoufouchi et al. (2000) provided a phylogenetic comparison of yeast and
human proteins of the polX family.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aoufouchi et al. (2000) determined that POLL is encoded by 8 exons and
spans approximately 9 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the POLL
gene to human chromosome 10 (TMAP sts-W69567).

609137	TITLE *609137 RECEPTOR-TRANSPORTING PROTEIN 1; RTP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human RTP1. The
deduced mouse Rtp1 protein contains 263 amino acids and shares 73%
identity with mouse Rtp2 (609138). Rtp1 lacks a signal peptide, but it
has a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues detected prominent expression of Rtp1 in olfactory and
vomeronasal organs. Long exposure revealed faint expression in brain. In
situ hybridization of mouse olfactory epithelium revealed specific
expression of Rtp1 in olfactory neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

Saito et al. (2004) showed that mouse Rtp1 and Rtp2 promoted functional
cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic kidney
cells. Rtp1 and Rtp2 were associated with OR proteins and enhanced the
OR responses to odorants. Similar but weaker effects were seen with a
third protein, Reep1 (609139). These findings suggested that RTP1 and
RTP2 play significant roles in the translocation of ORs to the plasma
membrane, as well as in the functioning of ORs.

604177	TITLE *604177 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L8; RPL8
DESCRIPTION The mammalian ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species (see 180450) and
approximately 80 different proteins (see 180466).

The rat ribosomal protein L8 (Rpl8) associates with 5.8S rRNA, very
likely participates in the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA, and has been
identified as a constituent of the EF2 (130610)-binding site at the
ribosomal subunit interface. By screening a human ovarian granulosa cell
cDNA expression library with antibodies against human follicular fluid
glycoproteins, Hanes et al. (1993) isolated a partial RPL8 cDNA. They
completed the full-length cDNA sequence using PCR. The deduced 257-amino
acid human RPL8 protein is identical to rat Rpl8. Northern blot analysis
detected a 900-bp RPL8 transcript in human granulosa cells and white
blood cells.

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid mapping analyses, Kenmochi
et al. (1998) mapped the human RPL8 gene to 8q.

157660	TITLE *157660 MITOCHONDRIAL RNA-PROCESSING ENDORIBONUCLEASE, RNA COMPONENT OF; RMRP
;;RMRPR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondrial RNA-processing endoribonuclease cleaves mitochondrial RNA
complementary to the light chain of the displacement loop at a unique
site (Chang and Clayton, 1987). The enzyme is a ribonucleoprotein whose
RNA component is a nuclear gene product. The RNA component is the first
RNA encoded by a single-copy gene in the nucleus and imported into
mitochondria. The RMRP gene is untranslated, i.e., it encodes an RNA,
not a protein.

MAPPING

By study of interspecific somatic cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization, Hsieh et al. (1989, 1990) located the RMRP gene to
9p21-p12. By interspecific hybrids, the corresponding gene was assigned
to mouse chromosome 4.

GENE FUNCTION

Clayton (2001) discussed the probable function of RMRP.

To provide a physiologic demonstration of a function for RNase MRP in
mammalian cells, Thiel et al. (2005) performed functional studies in
yeast and humans. They showed that different RMRP gene mutations lead to
decreased cell growth by impairing ribosomal assembly and by altering
cyclin-dependent cell cycle regulation. Clinical heterogeneity was
explained by a correlation between the level and type of functional
impairment in vitro and the severity of short stature or predisposition
to cancer. Whereas the cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250) founder 70A-G
mutation (157660.0001) affected both pathways intermediately, mutations
resulting in anauxetic dysplasia (607095) did not affect B-cyclin
(123836) mRNA levels but did severely incapacitate ribosomal assembly
via defective endonucleolytic cleavage. Anauxetic dysplasia mutations
thus lead to poor processing of ribosomal RNA while allowing normal mRNA
processing and, therefore, genetically separate the different functions
of RNase MRP.

Maida et al. (2009) demonstrated that TERT (187270) interacts with RMRP,
which is mutated in cartilage-hair hypoplasia. Human TERT and RMRP form
a distinct ribonucleoprotein complex that has RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase activity and produces double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that can
be processed into small interfering RNA (siRNA) in a Dicer
(606241)-dependent manner. Maida et al. (2009) showed that the human
TERT-RMRP RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) shows a strong preference
for RNA templates that can form 3-prime fold-back structures. Using RMRP
as a template, the TERT-RMRP RdRP produces dsRNAs that are processed by
Dicer into 22-nucleotide dsRNAs that contain 5-prime monophosphate and
3-prime hydroxyl groups that are loaded into AGO2 (606229), confirming
that these short RNAs represent endogenous siRNAs. The involvement of
human TERT in 2 syndromes characterized by stem cell failure
(cartilage-hair hypoplasia and dyskeratosis congenita, 127550) suggested
to Maida et al. (2009) that ribonucleoprotein complexes containing TERT
have a critical role in stem cell biology.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using a positional cloning strategy and mutation analysis, Ridanpaa et
al. (2001) showed that mutations in the RMRP gene are responsible for
cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH; 250250), an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by disproportionate short stature, hypoplastic hair,
ligamentous laxity, defective immunity, hypoplastic anemia, and neuronal
dysplasia of the intestine. The mutations identified in patients with
CHH were of 2 distinct types. The first category consisted of insertions
or duplications between 6 and 30 nucleotides long residing in the region
between the TATA box and the transcription initiation site. These
mutations interfered with the transcription of the RMRP gene. The second
category consisted of single-nucleotide substitutions and other changes
involving at most 2 nucleotides. These resided in highly conserved
residues of the transcribed sequence.

Ridanpaa et al. (2002) described 36 different mutations in the RMRP gene
in 91 Finnish and 44 non-Finnish CHH families. Based on their nature and
localization, these mutations could be classified into 3 categories:
mutations affecting the promoter region, small changes of conserved
nucleotides in the transcript, and insertions and duplications in the
5-prime end of the transcript. The only region of known function that
seemed to avoid mutations was the nucleolar localization signal region
between nucleotides 23 and 62. Eight different mutations in the promoter
region and 28 mutations in the RNA coding region of 267 nucleotides were
reported. The most common mutation in CHH patients was the 70A-G
transition (157600.0001). This mutation represented 92% of the mutations
in Finnish CHH patients. Studies of linkage disequilibrium based on
maximum likelihood estimates with close markers, genealogic studies, and
haplotype data suggested that the mutation was introduced to Finland
some 3,900 to 4,800 years ago and before the expansion of the
population. The same major mutation accounted for 48% of the mutations
among CHH patients from other parts of Europe, North and South America,
the Near East, and Australia. In the non-Finnish CHH families, the 70A-G
mutation segregated with the same major haplotype, although shorter, as
in most of the Finnish families. In 23 of these 27 chromosomes, the
common region extended over 60 kb; therefore, all the chromosomes most
likely arose from a solitary event many thousands of years ago.

Among the sporadic cases of CHH in which Ridanpaa et al. (2002)
identified mutations in the RMRP gene were 1 from China, 2 from Israel,
and 1 from Turkey. Families with more than 1 affected member affected by
CHH and found to have RMRP mutations were from Saudi Arabia and Poland.

Nakashima et al. (2003) identified novel mutations in the RMRP gene in
Japanese patients, but did not find the 70A-G common founder mutation in
any of the 12 patients studied.

Sequencing 120 RMRP alleles from a control group, Bonafe et al. (2002)
found an unusually high density of single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in and around the RMRP gene. The biologic significance of this
finding was unclear.

Upon finding causative mutations in the RMRP gene, Bonafe et al. (2002)
concluded that recessive metaphyseal dysplasia without hypotrichosis
(250460) is a variant of CHH, manifesting only as short stature and
metaphyseal dysplasia. Ridanpaa et al. (2003) studied the RMRP gene and
RNase P (H1RNA; 608513) in 20 patients with the diagnosis of Schmid-type
metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (156500) but no mutations detectable in the
COL10A1 gene (120110). Two patients were found to be homozygous for a
70A-G transition in the RMRP gene, which is the major mutation causing
CHH. The description suggests the metaphyseal dysplasia without
hypotrichosis described by Bonafe et al. (2002); the affected
individuals reported by Bonafe et al. (2002) were compound heterozygous
for the common Finnish mutation (157660.0001) and a duplication mutation
(157660.0005) in the RMRP gene.

Kuijpers et al. (2003) described a female patient in whom the diagnosis
of kyphomelic dysplasia (211350) was made in infancy because of her
short-limb dwarfism and kyphomelia, especially of the femurs. She
developed a combined aplastic anemia and immunodeficiency by the age of
2 years. These responded well to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
from her HLA-identical brother at the age of 3 years. Growth remained
extremely retarded, however. Clinical and radiologic features reported
up to the age of 8 years gradually changed and became more typical for
CHH, as was confirmed by the finding of compound heterozygosity for 2
novel mutations in the RMRP gene: 195insT (157660.0016) and 63C-T
(157660.0017). The 63C-T mutation was said to have previously been found
in an Australian CHH patient. Both mutations resided in evolutionarily
conserved nucleotides and were not found in healthy controls. Molecular
studies in the parents showed the father to have the 195insT and the
mother to have the 63C-T mutation.

Thiel et al. (2005) performed positional cloning at the locus for
anauxetic dysplasia (607095), a rare autosomal recessive
spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia characterized by the prenatal onset of
extreme short stature, an adult height of less than 85 cm, hypodontia,
and mild mental retardation. Homozygosity mapping led to the
identification of novel mutations in the RMRP gene
(157660.0018-157660.0021), indicating that the disorder is allelic to
cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250) as well as to metaphyseal dysplasia
without hypotrichosis.

Hermanns et al. (2005) studied the effects of mutations in both the
promoter and the transcribed region of RMRP. While mutations in the
promoter abolished transcription in vitro, RMRP RNA levels in patients
with transcribed mutations were also decreased, suggesting an unstable
RNA. RMRP mutations introduced into the yeast ortholog nuclear
mitochondrial endonuclease-1 (Nme1) exhibited normal mitochondrial
function, chromosomal segregation, and cell cycle progression, while a
CHH fibroblast cell line exhibited normal mitochondrial content.
However, the most commonly found mutation in CHH patients, 70A-G
(157660.0001), caused an alteration in ribosomal processing by altering
the ratio of the short versus the long form of the 5.8S rRNA in yeast.
Transcriptional profiling of CHH patient RNAs showed upregulation of
several cytokines and cell cycle regulatory genes, 1 of which has been
implicated in chondrocyte hypertrophy. Hermanns et al. (2005) suggested
that alteration of ribosomal processing in CHH may be associated with
altered cytokine signaling and cell cycle progression in terminally
differentiating cells in the lymphocytic and chondrocytic cell lineages.

Hirose et al. (2006) screened 9 Japanese patients for mutations in the
RMRP gene and identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations
in 6 patients. The authors noted that the 70A-G founder mutation
prevalent in Western populations had not been found in Japanese
patients, whereas 2 mutations common in Japanese patients, 218A-G
(157660.0013) and a 17-bp duplication at nucleotide +3 (157660.0014),
had not been reported in other populations. Haplotype analysis revealed
that the 2 latter mutations were contained within rare distinct
haplotypes, indicating the presence of unique founders among Japanese
CHH patients. Hirose et al. (2006) observed that none of the Japanese
patients they evaluated exhibited all of the skeletal, hair, and
immunologic features characteristic of classic CHH.

In 27 CHH patients referred for molecular evaluation of the clinical
diagnosis, Hermanns et al. (2006) found RMRP mutations in 22. The
phenotype in 1 of the 5 mutation-negative patients was fully congruent
with the adopted case definition of CHH. In a second of these patients,
the diagnosis of Schmid type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (156500) was
made and confirmed by the detection of a mutation in the COL10A1 gene.
The remaining patients most likely represented one or more metaphyseal
chondrodysplasias not hitherto delineated. The pattern of cumulative
growth in infancy and early childhood in the latter 4 patients was the
single feature with greatest negative predictive power for CHH. Fourteen
of the mutations reported by Hermanns et al. (2006) had not been
reported previously. Only 4 of 22 CHH patients were homozygous for the
70A-G mutation. Ridanpaa et al. (2002) postulated that the 70A-G
mutation was of ancient founder origin.

Thiel et al. (2007) stated that in addition to the founder mutation
70A-G, which is present in 92% of Finnish and 48% of non-Finnish
patients with CHH, a total of 25 insertions or duplications between the
TATA box and the transcription start site and more than 62 other
mutations within the RMRP gene had been identified in patients with
phenotypes in the cartilage hair hypoplasia-anauxetic dysplasia (CHH-AD)
spectrum. That spectrum, ranging from the milder phenotypes metaphyseal
dysplasia without hypotrichosis (250460) and CHH to the severe anauxetic
dysplasia, includes different degrees of short stature, hair hypoplasia,
defective erythrogenesis, and immunodeficiency. To investigate the
genotype-phenotype correlation, Thiel et al. (2007) analyzed the
position and the functional effect of 13 mutations in patients with
variable features of the CHH-AD spectrum. Those at the severe end of the
spectrum included a patient with anauxetic dysplasia who was compound
heterozygous for a null deletion mutation (157660.0022) and the 195C-T
mutation (see 157660.0009), which had been described in patients with
milder phenotypes. Mapping of nucleotide conservation to the
2-dimensional structure of the RMRP transcript showed that
disease-causing mutations either affect evolutionarily conserved
nucleotides or are likely to alter secondary structure through
mispairing in stem regions. In vitro testing of mitochondrial
RNA-processing ribonuclease multiprotein-specific mRNA and rRNA cleavage
of different mutations showed a strong correlation between the decrease
in rRNA cleavage in ribosomal assembly and the degree of bone dysplasia,
whereas reduced mRNA cleavage, and thus cell-cycle impairment, predicted
the presence of hair hypoplasia, immunodeficiency, and hematologic
abnormalities and thus increased cancer risk.

Nakashima et al. (2007) performed RT-PCR analysis of cDNA from CHH
patients carrying RMRP mutations, including 2 promoter mutations, a
16-bp duplication at +1 and a 17-bp duplication at +3 (157660.0014), and
2 transcribed mutations, 168G-A and 218A-G (157660.0013), and confirmed
lower expression levels of RMRP for all mutations. By 5-prime RACE
analysis, they showed that reduced transcription in the promoter mutants
was accompanied by shifting of the transcription initiation sites to
nucleotides 5-prime upstream of the authentic site. By RT-PCR analysis
of mouse fibroblasts transfected with transcribed mutant RMRP, they
confirmed reduced RMRP expression. Reduced transcription correlated with
greater instability of mutant RMRP transcripts compared to controls. A
comparable reduction of transcription was seen when the major CHH
mutation 70A-G was introduced into mouse ES cells, and low expression
level of the 70A-G Rmrp RNA was confirmed by expression assays in
cultured cells, and again correlated with RNA instability. Nakashima et
al. (2007) concluded that loss of mutant RNA transcripts is a critical
feature of pathogenesis of CHH.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITHOUT HYPOTRICHOSIS, INCLUDED
RMRP, 70A-G

Ridanpaa et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for an A-to-G transition
at nucleotide 70 (70A-G) of the RMRP gene in 42 Finnish families with
cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250), including 12 with more than 1
affected child and 30 with a single affected child. All of these
families carried modifications of the ancestral haplotype of DNA
polymorphisms. In additional CHH patients, the authors identified the
70A-G mutation in compound heterozygosity with another RMRP mutation
(e.g., 157660.0002). Another patient, who had been described as patient
A by Sulisalo et al. (1997), had uniparental disomy for chromosome 9
with 2 copies of the maternal, 70A-G mutation-carrying chromosome, and
no paternal chromosome 9. The 70A-G mutation was detected in
heterozygosity in 1 of 120 Finnish control samples and in 2 of 160
non-Finnish control samples.

Ridanpaa et al. (2003) reported that the most frequent, and perhaps
only, mutation causing CHH in the Old Order Amish in the United States
(in whom the disorder was first described) is the same 70A-G transition
that is the major mutation causing CHH in Finns. They stated that
although more than 40 different mutations in the RMRP gene had been
characterized in other populations, 70A-G was the most common
CHH-causing mutation worldwide. The mutation segregates with the same
major haplotype in Finns and Amish and others, suggesting that it is
very ancient.

Bonafe et al. (2002) found the common Finnish mutation in compound
heterozygous state with another mutation of RMRP (157660.0005) in
patients with a clinical picture of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia without
hypotrichosis (250460).

Ridanpaa et al. (2003) found homozygosity for the common Finnish
mutation in 2 of 20 Canadian patients diagnosed with Schmid-type
metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (156500) without the usual autosomal
dominant mutation in COL10A1 (120110). The patients later developed
features more typical of CHH.

Hermanns et al. (2006) found the 70A-G mutation in patient number 1 of
Williams et al. (2005) with CHH complicated by severe macrocytic anemia.
Repeated transfusions with irradiated packed red blood cells were
required. The patient remained transfusion-dependent but showed no signs
of compromised immunity. The usually mild anemia of CHH is most probably
self-limited. However, over half of CHH patients with severe anemia may
require life-long transfusions and bone marrow transplantation (Williams
et al., 2005).

The so-called Finnish-Amish common transition 70A-G was observed in 12
alleles among 22 confirmed CHH patients (27%) by Hermanns et al. (2006).

.0002
CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 262G-T

In 6 Finnish families with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250), including
1 family with 2 affected children, Ridanpaa et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 262 (262G-T) of the RMRP gene in
compound heterozygosity with the 70A-G mutation (157660.0001). The
chromosomes carrying the 262G-T mutation shared a haplotype that
differed from that of the main ancestral one. The 262G-T mutation was
not detected in any of 120 Finnish and 160 non-Finnish controls.

.0003
CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 10-BP DUP, NT-13

Ridanpaa et al. (2001) identified a 10-bp duplication (TACTCTGTGA) at
position -13 of the RMRP gene in compound heterozygosity with the 70A-G
mutation (157660.0001) in 2 Finnish families with cartilage-hair
hypoplasia (250250). The chromosomes carrying this mutation shared a
haplotype that differed from the ancestral one. This and all other
duplication-insertions found in the RMRP gene were not detected in 120
Finnish and 160 non-Finnish controls.

.0004
CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 15-BP DUP, NT-10

In a Swiss patient with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250), Ridanpaa et
al. (2001) identified a 15-bp duplication (ACTACTCTGTGAAGC) that
occurred twice at position -10 of the RMRP gene in compound
heterozygosity with a 2-bp duplication at nucleotide 98 (157660.0005).

.0005
CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 2-BP DUP, 98TG

Ridanpaa et al. (2001) identified a 2-bp duplication (TG) at nucleotide
98 of the RMRP gene in compound heterozygosity with a 15-bp duplication
at position -10 (157660.0004) in a Swiss patient with cartilage-hair
hypoplasia (250250) and with the 70A-G mutation (157660.0001) in a
Canadian patient with CHH.

.0006
CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 6-BP INS, NT-6

Ridanpaa et al. (2001) identified a 6-bp insertion (CCTGAG) at position
-6 of the RMRP gene in compound heterozygosity with the 70A-G mutation
(157660.0001) in a German patient with cartilage-hair hypoplasia
(250250).

CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 18-BP DUP, NT-3

In an English patient with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250), Ridanpaa
et al. (2001) identified an 18-bp duplication (TCTGTGAAGCTGAGGAC) at
position -3 of the RMRP gene in compound heterozygosity with a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 193 (193G-A; 157660.0008). The 193G-A mutation
was not found in 112 Finnish and 93 non-Finnish controls.

METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITHOUT HYPOTRICHOSIS
RMRP, 195C-T, 238C-T, 12-BP DUP

In 2 unrelated boys with short stature and metaphyseal dysplasia similar
to CHH, but lacking hair anomalies, immunodeficiency, and other
extraskeletal features (metaphyseal dysplasia without hypotrichosis;
250460), Bonafe et al. (2002) identified mutations in the RMRP gene. One
allele was the common Finnish mutation (157660.0001). The other 3
alleles in the 2 boys carried +195C-T, +238C-T, and a 12-bp duplication
at -2. One boy was of Swiss and Danish extraction, the other of Austrian
origin.

METAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITHOUT HYPOTRICHOSIS
RMRP, 17-BP INS, NT-20

Nakashima et al. (2003) described a 7-year-old Japanese girl who had
skeletal changes consistent with CHH but showed neither hypoplastic hair
nor immunodeficiency. Radiography showed brachydactyly with cone-shaped
epiphyses in the phalanges of the hands and metaphyseal dysplasia in the
long and short tubular bones, especially in the distal femur. Mutation
analysis showed compound heterozygosity for mutations in the RMRP gene:
a 17-bp insertion (TCTGTGAAGCTGGGGAC) at -20 and a 218A-G transition
(157660.0013). The insertion was found on the paternal allele and the
nucleotide substitution on the maternal allele.

CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 17-BP DUP, NT3

In a Japanese patient with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (250250), Nakashima
et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
RMRP gene: a 17-bp duplication (GAAGCTGAGGACGTGGT) at +3 inherited from
the mother and a de novo 182G-A mutation (157660.0015). Parenthood was
confirmed by testing for polymorphic markers.

.0015
CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 182G-A

See 157660.0014 and Nakashima et al. (2003). Nakashima et al. (2003)
stated that the 182G-A mutation was the first de novo mutation in the
RMRP gene to be reported.

.0016
CARTILAGE-HAIR HYPOPLASIA
RMRP, 1-BP INS, 195T

Kuijpers et al. (2003) described a girl who in the first 2 years of life
was thought to have kyphomelic dysplasia (211350) because of her
short-limb dwarfism and bowed extremities affecting especially the
femurs. At the age of 2 years she developed a combined immunodeficiency
and aplastic anemia that responded well to allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation, although growth remained extremely retarded. Over 8
years of observation, clinical and radiologic symptoms gradually changed
and became more typical for CHH (250250). Compound heterozygosity for 2
novel mutations in the RMRP gene were found: 195insT and 63C-T
(157660.0013).

ANAUXETIC DYSPLASIA
RMRP, 14-BP INS, NT111

In 3 affected members of a Jordanian family with anauxetic dysplasia
(607095) reported by Menger et al. (1996), Thiel et al. (2005) found
homozygosity for an insertion of 14 nucleotides between nucleotides 111
and 112 of the RMRP cDNA. The parents were consanguineous.

.0019
ANAUXETIC DYSPLASIA
RMRP, 14G-A

In the German family with anauxetic dysplasia (607095) reported by Horn
et al. (2001), Thiel et al. (2005) found that both affected members were
compound heterozygous for 2 mutations of the RMRP gene: 14G-A and
90_91AG-GC (157660.0020).

.0020
ANAUXETIC DYSPLASIA
RMRP, AG-GC, NT90

In a family with 2 affected children with anauxetic dysplasia (607095)
reported by Horn et al. (2001) and in a single patient, Thiel et al.
(2005) found the same mutation in the RMRP gene, 90_91AG-GC. The family
and the single patient were from the same region of Germany and carried
the 90_91AG-GC mutation on the same ancestral haplotype, confirming a
founder effect. The mutation occurred in compound heterozygosity in all
3 individuals, with a 14G-A mutation in the family (157660.0019) and
with a 254C-G mutation in the single patient (157660.0021).

.0021
ANAUXETIC DYSPLASIA
RMRP, 254C-G

Thiel et al. (2005) found an individual with anauxetic dysplasia
(607095), the offspring of nonconsanguineous parents, to be compound
heterozygous for 90_91AG-GC (157660.0020) and 254C-G mutations in the
RMRP gene.

.0022
ANAUXETIC DYSPLASIA
RMRP, 10-BP DEL, NT254

In a patient with anauxetic dysplasia (607095), Thiel et al. (2007)
found compound heterozygosity for a 10-bp null mutation of the RMRP gene
(254_263delCTCAGCGCGG) and the transcribed mutation 195C-T
(157660.0009), which had been previously described in patients with
milder phenotypes.

;;SCAVENGER RECEPTOR EXPRESSED BY ENDOTHELIAL CELLS; SREC;;
SREC1;;
SREC I;;
KIAA0149
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Scavenger receptors mediate the endocytosis of chemically modified
lipoproteins. SCARF1 specifically mediates the selective uptake of
acetylated low density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) into endothelial cells.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a myeloid leukemia cell cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (1995) cloned SCARF1, which they designated KIAA0149. The
deduced 830-amino acid protein contains a putative transmembrane domain
and an EGF-like pattern of cysteine repeats. SCARF1 shares about 33%
identity over 147 amino acids with mouse Tie2 (600221), an epithelial
receptor tyrosine kinase. The 3-prime untranslated region contains an
Alu repeat. Northern blot analysis detected expression in most tissues
examined, with highest levels in lung and spleen. No expression was
detected in HeLa cells, pancreas, or colon.

Adachi et al. (1997) cloned SCARF1, which they designated SREC, using an
expression cloning strategy in which they assayed for uptake of
fluorescence-labeled Ac-LDL into CHO cells transfected with a human
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library. The deduced
830-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 86 kD.
SCARF1 contains a hydrophobic signal sequence followed by 5 EGF-like
cysteine pattern signatures in its extracellular N-terminal half, a
transmembrane region, and an intracellular C-terminal half containing a
serine/proline-rich region followed by a glycine-rich region. It has 3
potential N-glycosylation sites and several putative sites for serine
and threonine phosphorylation. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.5-kb
transcript expressed in HUVECs and in coronary artery endothelial cells,
but not in coronary artery smooth muscle cells.

Adachi and Tsujimoto (2002) identified several SCARF1 variants in a
peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library. Alternative splicing introduces
a stop codon before the transmembrane region in 2 of the variants,
resulting in soluble forms of SCARF1.

GENE FUNCTION

Adachi et al. (1997) determined that CHO cells stably expressing SCARF1
bound radiolabeled Ac-LDL with high affinity and degraded it via an
endocytic pathway. The association between SCARF1 and Ac-LDL was
inhibited by oxidized LDL, malondialdehyde-modified LDL, dextran
sulfate, and polyinosinic acid, but not by natural LDL or heparin.

Adachi and Tsujimoto (2002) determined that all membrane-bound splice
variants of SCARF1 showed receptor activity toward Ac-LDL. They
identified a transcriptional activator of SCARF1, ZNF444 (607874).
Overexpression of ZNF444 in HUVECs increased SCARF1 promoter activity
nearly 2.5-fold. An intact SP1 (189906) motif and an intact inverted
repeat sequence with a triple-nucleotide spacer (IR3), which binds
ZNF444, were required for maximal SCARF1 expression. Several
inflammatory cytokines inhibited SCARF1 promoter activity in vitro and
decreased Ac-LDL uptake in vivo.

Means et al. (2009) showed that the scavenger receptors Scarf1 and Cd36
(173510) mediated mouse defense against 2 fungal pathogens, Cryptococcus
neoformans and Candida albicans, by enabling production of antimicrobial
peptides. Studies in C. elegans indicated that the homologous proteins
protected nematodes. Macrophage binding and cytokine production required
Cd36, but not Tlr2 (603028), and binding was dependent on recognition of
pathogen beta-glucans. Mice lacking Cd36, but expressing other
beta-glucan receptors (e.g., CLEC7A; 606264), had a higher fungal burden
and greater mortality after intravenous infection with C. neoformans
compared with wildtype mice. Means et al. (2009) concluded that SCARF1
and CD36 are beta-glucan-binding receptors and are involved in an
evolutionarily conserved pathway for the innate sensing of fungal
pathogens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Adachi and Tsujimoto (2002) determined that the SCARF1 gene contains 11
exons and spans 12 kb. The 5-prime flanking region lacks TATA and CCAAT
boxes, but it contains several putative motifs for DNA-binding elements,

;;POLYPYRIMIDINE TRACT-BINDING PROTEIN-ASSOCIATED SPLICING FACTOR; PSF;;
PTB-ASSOCIATED SPLICING FACTOR
SFPQ/TFE3 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNA-binding protein PSF is a pre-mRNA splicing factor that also acts
as a transcriptional corepressor, and is a constituent of the PERIOD
(PER) complex involved in the generation of circadian rhythms (summary
by Duong et al., 2011).

CLONING

Patton et al. (1993) identified a 100-kD protein that copurified and
associated with polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB; 600693). By
microsequence analysis and PCR, followed by screening a fetal brain cDNA
library, Patton et al. (1993) isolated cDNAs encoding alternatively
spliced isoforms of this protein, which they called PSF (PTB-associated
splicing factor). The deduced 669- and 707-amino acid PSF isoforms
contain 2 consensus RNA-binding domains and an unusual N terminus rich
in proline and glutamine residues. PSF is highly basic and has a
predicted molecular mass of 76 kD, which is much lower than the
experimentally determined molecular mass of 100 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected PSF transcripts of 2.5 and 3.0 kb, consistent with the
alternative splicing. The authors found that the RNA-binding properties
of PSF are identical to those of PTB and that both proteins, together
and independently, bind the polypyrimidine tract of mammalian introns.
Biochemical complementation, antibody inhibition, and immunodepletion
experiments demonstrated that PSF is an essential pre-mRNA splicing
factor required early in spliceosome formation. Bacterially synthesized
PSF was able to complement immunodepleted extracts and restore splicing
activity. Despite its association with PSF, complementary experiments
with antibodies against PTB did not suggest an essential role for PTB in
pre-mRNA splicing.

CYTOGENETICS

Clark et al. (1997) identified cases of papillary renal cell carcinoma
(RCCX1; 300854) in which the splicing factor gene PSF was partnered with
the TFE3 gene as a result of a translocation, t(X;1)(p11.2;p34).

GENE FUNCTION

Duong et al. (2011) analyzed protein constituents of PERIOD (PER)
complexes purified from mouse tissues and identified PSF. Within the
complex, PSF functions to recruit SIN3A (607776), a scaffold for
assembly transcriptional inhibitory complexes; the PER complex thereby
rhythmically delivers histone deacetylases to the PER1 (602260)
promoter, which repress PER1 transcription. Duong et al. (2011)
concluded that their findings provided a function for the PER complex
and a molecular mechanism for circadian clock negative feedback.

603109	TITLE *603109 MOTHERS AGAINST DECAPENTAPLEGIC, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; SMAD3
;;MADH3;;
SMA- AND MAD-RELATED PROTEIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Drosophila Mad is required for signaling by the TGF-beta (e.g.,
190180)-related factor decapentaplegic. Zhang et al. (1996) cloned a
human cDNA encoding MADH3, a homolog of Drosophila Mad. The deduced
425-amino acid MADH3 protein (GenBank GENBANK 2522267) is 92% identical
to MADH2 (601366).

By searching an expressed sequence tag database with the protein
sequences of Mad and Mad homologs, Riggins et al. (1996) isolated human
cDNAs encoding MADH3, which they called JV15-2. The C terminus of MADH3
shows significant homology to that of Drosophila Mad.

GENE STRUCTURE

Arai et al. (1998) determined the genomic structure of SMAD3, which
contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

Riggins et al. (1996) mapped the MADH3 gene to 15q21-q22 by somatic cell
hybrid analysis and screening of YAC clones.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (1996) showed that MADH3 and MADH4 (SMAD4; 600993)
synergized to induce strong ligand-independent TGF-beta-like responses.
MADH3 containing a C-terminal truncation acted as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of the normal TGF-beta response. The activity of MADH3 was
regulated by the TGF-beta receptors (e.g., 190181), and MADH3 was
phosphorylated and associated with the ligand-bound receptor complex.
Zhang et al. (1996) stated that these results define MADH3 as an
effector of the TGF-beta response.

Zawel et al. (1998) found that human SMAD3 and SMAD4 proteins could
specifically recognize an identical 8-bp palindromic sequence
(GTCTAGAC). Tandem repeats of this palindrome conferred striking
TGF-beta responsiveness to a minimal promoter. This responsiveness was
abrogated by targeted deletion of the cellular SMAD4 gene. These results
showed that SMAD proteins are involved in the biologic responses to
TGF-beta and related ligands.

Scleroderma is a chronic systemic disease that leads to fibrosis of the
skin and other affected organs. TGFB has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of scleroderma. SMAD proteins function as signaling
transducers downstream from TGFB receptors. Dong et al. (2002)
investigated the signaling components of the TGFB pathway and TGFB
activity in scleroderma lesions in vivo and in scleroderma fibroblasts
in vitro. Basal level and TGFB-inducible expression of SMAD7 (602932)
were selectively decreased, whereas SMAD3 expression was increased both
in scleroderma skin and in explanted scleroderma fibroblasts in culture.
TGFB signaling events were increased in scleroderma fibroblasts relative
to normal fibroblasts. In vitro adenoviral gene transfer with SMAD7
restored normal TGFB signaling in scleroderma fibroblasts. These results
suggested that alterations in the SMAD pathway, including marked SMAD7
deficiency and SMAD3 upregulation, may be responsible for TGFB
hyperresponsiveness observed in scleroderma.

You and Kruse (2002) studied corneal myofibroblast differentiation and
signal transduction induced by the TGFB family members activin A
(147290) and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7; 112267). They found
that activin A induced phosphorylation of SMAD2 (601366), and BMP7
induced SMAD1 (601595), both of which were inhibited by follistatin
(136470). Transfection with antisense SMAD2/SMAD3 prevented
activin-induced expression and accumulation of alpha-smooth muscle
actin. The authors concluded that TGFB proteins have different functions
in the cornea. Activin A and TGFB1, but not BMP7, are regulators of
keratocyte differentiation and might play a role during myofibroblast
transdifferentiation. SMAD2/SMAD3 signal transduction appeared to be
important in the regulation of muscle-specific genes.

SMAD3 is a direct mediator of transcriptional activation by the TGF-beta
receptor. Its target genes in epithelial cells include cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK; see 116953) inhibitors that generate a cytostatic response.
Chen et al. (2002) defined how, in the same context, SMAD3 can mediate
transcriptional repression of the growth-promoting gene MYC (190080). A
complex containing SMAD3, the transcription factors E2F4 (600659), E2F5
(600967), and DP1 (189902), and the corepressor p107 (116957) preexists
in the cytoplasm. In response to TGF-beta, this complex moves into the
nucleus and associates with SMAD4, recognizing a composite SMAD-E2F site
on MYC for repression. Previously known as the ultimate recipients of
CDK regulatory signals, E2F4/E2F5 and p107 act here as transducers of
TGF-beta receptor signals upstream of CDK. SMAD proteins therefore
mediate transcriptional activation or repression depending on their
associated partners.

TGFB (190180) stimulation leads to phosphorylation and activation of
SMAD2 and SMAD3, which form complexes with SMAD4 that accumulate in the
nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes. Inman et al. (2002)
demonstrated that following TGFB stimulation of epithelial cells,
receptors remain active for at least 3 to 4 hours, and continuous
receptor activity is required to maintain active SMADs in the nucleus
and for TGFB-induced transcription. Continuous nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling of the SMADs during active TGFB signaling provides the
mechanism whereby the intracellular transducers of the signal
continuously monitor receptor activity. These data explain how, at all
times, the concentration of active SMADs in the nucleus is directly
dictated by the levels of activated receptors in the cytoplasm.

Based upon molecular allelotyping and comparative genomic hybridization
studies, chromosome 15q is the likely location of a tumor suppressor
gene important in the pathogeneses of sporadic enteropancreatic
endocrine tumors and parathyroid adenomas. To determine whether SMAD3
plays a primary role in the development of these tumors, Shattuck et al.
(2002) investigated 20 enteropancreatic tumors and 67 parathyroid
adenomas for LOH at DNA markers surrounding SMAD3. Twenty percent of
enteropancreatic tumors and 24% of parathyroid adenomas showed loss. All
9 coding exons and intron-exon boundaries of the SMAD3 gene were then
sequenced in genomic DNA from all 20 enteropancreatic and 25 parathyroid
tumors, including every case with LOH. No acquired clonal mutations,
insertions, or microdeletions in SMAD3 were detected in any tumors.
Because inactivating somatic mutation is the hallmark of an authentic
tumor suppressor, SMAD3 is unlikely to function as a classic tumor
suppressor gene in the pathogenesis of sporadic parathyroid or
enteropancreatic endocrine tumors.

Matsuura et al. (2004) showed that SMAD3 is a major physiologic
substrate of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 (123829) and CDK2
(116953). Except for the retinoblastoma protein family, SMAD3 was the
only CDK4 substrate demonstrated to that time. Matsuura et al. (2004)
mapped CDK4 and CDK2 phosphorylation sites to thr8, thr178, and ser212
in SMAD3. Mutation of the CDK phosphorylation sites increased Smad3
transcriptional activity, leading to higher expression of the CDK
inhibitor p15 (600431). Mutation of the CDK phosphorylation sites of
Smad3 also increased its ability to downregulate the expression of
c-myc. Using Smad3 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts and other
epithelial cell lines, Matsuura et al. (2004) further showed that Smad3
inhibits cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase and that mutation of
the CDK phosphorylation sites in Smad3 increases this ability. They
concluded that CDK phosphorylation of SMAD3 inhibits its transcriptional
activity and antiproliferative function.

To determine the role of SMAD3 in the pathogenesis of lymphoid
neoplasia, Wolfraim et al. (2004) measured SMAD3 mRNA and protein in
leukemia cells obtained at diagnosis from 19 children with acute
leukemia: 10 with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 7 with
pre-B-cell ALL, and 2 with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). SMAD3
protein was absent in T-cell ALL but present in pre-B-cell ALL and ANLL.
No mutations in the SMAD3 gene were identified in T-cell ALL, and SMAD3
mRNA was present in T-cell ALL and normal T cells at similar levels.
Wolfraim et al. (2004) concluded that loss of SMAD3 protein is a
specific feature of pediatric T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia.

Gupta et al. (2006) retracted their paper describing the identification
of a microRNA in the latency-associated transcript (Lat) of herpes
simplex virus (HSV)-1 (miR-Lat) that targets TGFB and SMAD3 via
sequences in their 3-prime UTRs that show partial homology to miR-Lat.

In experiments using mouse muscle, Carlson et al. (2008) found that, in
addition to the loss of Notch (190198) activation, old muscle produces
excessive TGF-beta (but not myostatin, 601788), which induces unusually
high levels of Smad3 in resident satellite cells and interferes with the
regenerative capacity. Importantly, endogenous Notch and Smad3
antagonize each other in the control of satellite cell proliferation,
such that activation of Notch blocks the TGF-beta-dependent upregulation
of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p15, p16 (600160), p21
(116899), and p27 (600778), whereas inhibition of Notch induces them.
Furthermore, in muscle stem cells, Notch activity determined the binding
of Smad3 to the promoters of these negative regulators of cell cycle
progression. Attenuation of TGF-beta/Smad3 in old, injured muscle
restored regeneration to satellite cells in vivo. Thus, a balance
between endogenous Smad3 and active Notch controls the regenerative
competence of muscle stem cells, and deregulation of this balance in the
old muscle microniche interferes with regeneration.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta (190180) and
BMPs (see 112264) is mediated by miR21 (611020). miR21 downregulates
PDCD4 (608610), which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth
muscle contractile genes. Surprisingly, TGF-beta and BMP signaling
promoted a rapid increase in expression of mature miR21 through a
posttranscriptional step, promoting the processing of primary
transcripts of miR21 (pri-miR21) into precursor miR21 (pre-miR21) by the
Drosha complex (see 608828). TGF-beta and BMP-specific SMAD signal
transducers SMAD1 (601595), SMAD2 (601366), SMAD3, and SMAD5 (603110)
are recruited to pri-miR21 in a complex with the RNA helicase p68 (DDX5;
180630), a component of the Drosha microprocessor complex. The shared
cofactor SMAD4 (600993) is not required for this process. Thus, Davis et
al. (2008) concluded that regulation of microRNA biogenesis by
ligand-specific SMAD proteins is critical for control of the vascular
smooth muscle cell phenotype and potentially for SMAD4-independent
responses mediated by the TGF-beta and BMP signaling pathways.

Chuderland et al. (2008) identified an SPS motif in ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948)
and SMAD3 and a similar TPT motif in MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872) that directed
protein nuclear accumulation when phosphorylated.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using cDNA, Roth et al. (2000) conducted mutation analysis of the SMAD2,
SMAD3, and SMAD4 genes in 14 Finnish kindreds with hereditary
nonpolyposis colon cancer (see 120435). They found no mutations.

In a 4-generation Dutch family with arterial aneurysms and dissections
and early-onset osteoarthritis mapping to chromosome 15q22.2-q24.2, van
de Laar et al. (2011) analyzed the candidate gene SMAD3 and identified
heterozygosity for a missense mutation (R287W; 603109.0001) that
segregated with disease. The authors designated the disorder
aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (AOS), but it is here incorporated
into the Loeys-Dietz phenotypic series as Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 3
(LDS3; 613795). Analysis of SMAD3 in 99 patients with thoracic aortic
aneurysms and dissections and Marfan-like features, who were known to be
negative for mutation in the FBN1 (134797), TGFBR1 (190181), and TGFBR2
(190182) genes, revealed 2 additional probands with heterozygous SMAD3
mutations (603109.0002; 603109.0003). All 3 mutations were located in
the MH2 domain, which mediates oligomerization of SMAD3 with SMAD4
(600993) and SMAD-dependent transcriptional activation.

Regalado et al. (2011) reported 4 new mutations in SMAD3. One mutation
(603109.0004) was a frameshift mutation in exon 5 segregating in a
family with LDS3 phenotype. The other 3 were missense mutations in
invariant codons.

Van de Laar et al. (2012) identified 5 novel SMAD3 mutations in 5
additional families with aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (see, e.g.,
603109.0008-603109.0010).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhu et al. (1998) reported the targeted disruption of the mouse Smad3
gene. Smad3 mutant mice were viable and fertile. Between 4 and 6 months
of age, the Smad3 mutant mice became moribund with colorectal
adenocarcinomas. The neoplasms penetrated through the intestinal wall
and metastasized to lymph nodes. Since TGF-beta transduces its signal to
the interior of the cell via Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, these results
directly implicate TGF-beta signaling in the pathogenesis of colorectal
cancer and provide a compelling animal model for the study of human
colorectal cancer.

Yang et al. (1999) found that Smad3-null (ex8/ex8) mice died between 1
and 8 months due to a primary defect in immune function. The mice
exhibited inflammatory lesions in a number of organs, including the
nasal mucosa, stomach, pancreas, colon, and small intestine, as well as
enlarged lymph nodes, an involuted thymus, and the formation of
bacterial abscesses adjacent to mucosal surfaces. Immunostaining
revealed a significant increase in T-cell activation, suggesting that
Smad3 has a role in TGFB-mediated regulation of T-cell activation.

Renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a chronic inflammatory condition in
which renal fibrosis is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal
transition of the renal tubules and synthesis of extracellular matrix in
response to multiple entities, including ureteral obstruction. TGFB
plays a pivotal role in the disease process. Sato et al. (2003) found
that Smad3-null mice with ureteral obstruction were protected against
tubulointerstitial fibrosis, presumably by blocking the downstream
effects of TGFB. Levels of TGFB mRNA and mature protein were decreased
in the mutant animals compared to experimental controls, indicating that
the Smad3 pathway is also essential for autoinduction of TGFB.

Wolfraim et al. (2004) used mice in which 1 or both alleles of Smad3
were inactivated to evaluate the role of Smad3 in the response of normal
T cells to TGF-beta and in the susceptibility to spontaneous
leukemogenesis in mice in which both alleles of the tumor suppressor
p27(Kip1) (CDKN1B; 600778) were deleted. The loss of 1 allele for Smad3
impaired the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta on the proliferation of
normal T cells and worked in tandem with the homozygous inactivation of
p27(Kip1) to promote T-cell leukemogenesis. Wolfraim et al. (2004)
concluded that a reduction in Smad3 expression and the loss of p27(Kip1)
work synergistically to promote T-cell leukemogenesis in mice.

Ashcroft et al. (1999) generated Smad3-null mice and observed
accelerated cutaneous wound healing, with complete reepithelialization
by day 2 compared to day 5 in wildtype mice, and significantly reduced
local infiltration of monocytes. Smad3 -/- keratinocytes showed altered
patterns of growth and migration, and Smad3 -/- monocytes exhibited a
selectively blunted chemotactic response to TGF-beta (190180).

Arany et al. (2006) created excisional ear wounds in Smad3 -/- mice and
observed wound enlargement compared to wildtype controls. Levels of
elastin and glycosaminoglycans were increased, collagen fibers were more
compactly organized, and integrins, TGFB1, and matrix metalloproteinases
were altered both basally and after wounding in Smad3-knockout mice.
Mechanical testing revealed an increased modulus of elasticity,
suggesting an imbalance of tissue forces. Arany et al. (2006) proposed
that the altered mechanical elastic properties lead to a persistent
retractile force that is opposed by decreased wound contractile forces.

Kanamaru et al. (2005) found that bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs)
from Smad3-null mice had an augmented capacity to produce
proinflammatory cytokines upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Mast
cell-deficient mice reconstituted with Smad3-null BMMCs survived
significantly longer in an acute peritonitis model than mast
cell-deficient mice reconstituted with wildtype BMMCs. Kanamaru et al.
(2005) proposed that SMAD3 in mast cells inhibits mast cell-mediated
immune responses against gram-negative bacteria.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, ARG287TRP

In 20 affected members of a 4-generation Dutch family with arterial
aneurysms and dissections and early-onset osteoarthritis (LDS3; 613795),
van de Laar et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for an 859C-T
transition in exon 6 of the SMAD3 gene, resulting in an arg287-to-trp
(R287W) substitution at a highly conserved residue within the MH2
domain. The mutation was not found in 7 unaffected family members or in
544 Dutch control chromosomes. Immunohistochemical analysis of aortic
wall tissue from 2 patients showed increased expression of key proteins
in the TGF-beta (see TGFB1, 190180) pathway.

.0002
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, 2-BP DEL, 741AT

In 3 Dutch sibs with arterial aneurysms and dissections and early-onset
osteoarthritis (LDS3; 613795), van de Laar et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 2-bp deletion (741delAT) in exon 6 of the SMAD3
gene, resulting in a frameshift and a premature termination sequence at
codon 309 in exon 7 that removes nearly the complete MH2 domain
(Thr247ProfsX61). The deletion, which was presumably present in their
affected deceased father, was not found in their unaffected mother or in
544 Dutch control chromosomes. Analysis of patient cDNA showed very weak
mutant signal compared to wildtype, and treatment of patient fibroblast
cultures with cycloheximide markedly increased the mutant signal,
indicating that most of the abnormal RNA was subjected to nonsense
messenger RNA decay and that a truncated SMAD3 protein was barely
formed.

.0003
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, THR261ILE

In a Dutch male patient with arterial aneurysm and early-onset
osteoarthritis (LDS3; 613795), van de Laar et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 783C-T transition in exon 6 of the SMAD3 gene,
resulting in a thr261-to-ile (T261I) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the MH2 domain. The mutation was not found in 544 Dutch
control chromosomes.

.0004
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, 1-BP DEL, 652A

In a 3-generation pedigree segregating autosomal dominant thoracic
aortic aneurysms and dissections with intracranial and other arterial
aneurysms (LDS3; 613795), Regalado et al. (2011) identified a deletion
of an A at nucleotide 652 in exon 5 of the SMAD3 gene, resulting in
frameshift leading to premature termination following asparagine-218
(N218fs). This mutation was present in all individuals with vascular
disease in the family and segregated with a lod score of 2.52. The
pedigree had originally been reported by Regalado et al. (2011). The
mutation was absent from 2,300 control exomes.

.0005
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, ARG279LYS

In 2 unrelated families of European descent with autosomal dominant
thoracic aortic and other aneurysms (LDS3; 613795), Regalado et al.
(2011) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 836 in exon 6 of the
SMAD3 gene, resulting in an arg-to-lys substitution at codon 279
(R279K). Arg279 is completely conserved from human to Drosophila, and
the R279K mutation was predicted to disrupt protein function. The
mutation was not identified in 2,300 control exomes. There was decreased
penetrance in younger family members.

.0006
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, GLU239LYS

In a small family with 3 sibs affected with thoracic aortic aneurysm and
dissection (LDS3; 613795), Regalado et al. (2011) identified a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 715 in exon 6 of the SMAD3 gene, resulting in a
glutamine-to-lysine substitution at codon 239 (E239K). Exon 6 encodes
the MH2 protein-protein binding domain. Glu239 is completely conserved
from human to Drosophila, and the E239K mutation was predicted to
disrupt protein function. The mutation was not identified in 2,300
control exomes.

.0007
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, ALA112VAL

In a family segregating autosomal dominant thoracic aortic aneurysm with
dissection as well as other features of Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS3;
613795) including bifid uvula and scoliosis, and early-onset
osteoarthritis, Regalado et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
alanine-to-valine substitution at codon 112 (A112V). The mutation
segregated with disease with reduced penetrance in this family and was
not identified in 2,300 control exomes. Guo (2012) stated that the
correct nucleotide change for the A112V mutation is 335C-T in exon 2
rather than 235C-T as cited in Regalado et al. (2011).

.0008
LOEYS-DIETZ SYNDROME, TYPE 3
SMAD3, 1-BP DEL, 313G

In a patient with aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (LCS3; 613795), van

the SMAD3 gene (313delG), resulting in a frameshift (ala105profsX11).

In a patient with aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndrome (LCS3; 613795), van

resulting in a pro263-to-leu (P263L) substitution.

In affected members of a family segregating aneurysms-osteoarthritis
syndrome (LCS3; 613795), van de Laar et al. (2012) identified a 1-bp
duplication at nucleotide 1080 in the SMAD3 gene (1080dupT), resulting
in a glu361-to-ter (E361X) substitution.

609538	TITLE *609538 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, MITOCHONDRIAL, 1; PTPMT1
;;PTEN-LIKE PHOSPHATASE; PLIP;;
PHOSPHOINOSITIDE LIPID PHOSPHATASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases using the phosphatase domain of PTEN (601728) as
query, Pagliarini et al. (2004) identified PTPMT1, which they called
PLIP. Database analysis using the mouse ortholog, which encodes a
deduced 261-amino acid protein, revealed 60 orthologs from 4 different
phylogenetic kingdoms that share more than 70% amino acid identity
within the active site region. The active site sequence between amino
acids 128 and 148 of mouse and human PLIP is identical. Northern blot
analysis of several mouse tissues detected highest expression in testis.
In addition to testis, RT-PCR detected expression in brain, liver,
skeletal muscle, and uterus, with low levels in all other tissues
examined.

Pagliarini et al. (2005) found that mouse Ptpmt1 was targeted to
mitochondria in transfected COS-1 cells. Targeting was determined by an
N-terminal signal sequence, and Ptpmt1 was anchored to the matrix face
of the inner membrane.

GENE FUNCTION

Pagliarini et al. (2004) found that recombinant mouse Plip showed highly
selective activity against phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate
(PtdIns(5)P), with a pH optimum at 5.5. Plip showed activity against
PtdIns(5)P that was 44-fold greater than that against PtdIns(3,5)P2, its
second most preferred substrate, when the phosphoinositides were
presented in a lipid bilayer with phosphatidylserine.

Pagliarini et al. (2005) found that knockdown of Ptpmt1 expression in a
rat pancreatic insulinoma cell line altered the mitochondrial
phosphoprotein profile and enhanced both ATP production and insulin
secretion.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PTPMT1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH47256).

607816	TITLE *607816 POLYCOMB GROUP RING FINGER PROTEIN 6; PCGF6
;;RING FINGER PROTEIN 134; RNF134;;
MEL18- AND BMI1-LIKE RING FINGER PROTEIN; MBLR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for proteins related to MEL18 (600346) and BMI1
(164831), followed by screening an adult testis cDNA library, Akasaka et
al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding RNF134, which they called
MBLR. The deduced 352-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
proline-rich region followed by a glutamine-rich region and a central
domain that includes a RING finger motif. MBLR does not have the
C-terminal PEST sequence found in MEL18 and BMI1. Mouse and human MBLR
share 87% sequence identity, and the central domain of MBLR shares 38%
identity with the corresponding regions of MEL18 and BMI1. Northern blot
analysis detected high expression of a 2.5-kb transcript in testis, with
lower levels in heart and very low levels in all other tissues examined.
A minor transcript of 4.5 kb was also expressed in some tissues. RT-PCR
confirmed ubiquitous expression. Western blot analysis detected
endogenous expression of a doublet of 60 and 65 kD in osteosarcoma
cells. Western blot analysis of mouse tissues detected a 60-kD protein
expressed at highest levels in testis and at lower levels in all other
tissues examined. Subcellular visualization localized MBLR in the
nucleus of interphase cells and excluded it from the nucleolus.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Akasaka et al. (2002) determined that human
MBLR interacts strongly with mouse Ring1a (RING1; 602045) and Ring1b
(RNF2), moderately with Bmi1, weakly with Mph2 (EDR2; 602979), and not
at all with Mel18. Using deletion mutants, they determined that the
interaction between MBLR and Ring1b occurred through 2 regions of each
protein. Interaction required the C termini of both proteins, the RING
finger domain of Ring1b, and a central region of MBLR that also contains
the RING finger domain. The N terminus of MBLR may also have contributed
to the interaction. Akasaka et al. (2002) found that the intracellular
localization of MBLR changed during the cell cycle. MBLR showed a
fine-grained distribution throughout the nucleoplasm in interphase
cultured cells and a fainter diffuse cytoplasmic distribution during
mitosis. MBLR was phosphorylated on ser32 during mitosis.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MBLR
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP SHGC-34357).

136515	TITLE *136515 FOS-LIKE ANTIGEN 1; FOSL1
;;FOS-RELATED ANTIGEN 1; FRA1
DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells derived from hematopoietic
precursors of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Mice lacking Fos (164810)
develop osteopetrosis (see 166600) due to an early differentiation block
in the osteoclast lineage. Matsuo et al. (2000) investigated the
mechanism by which Fos exerts its specific function in osteoclast
differentiation. They showed by retroviral-gene transfer that all 4 Fos
proteins--Fos, FosB (164772), Fosl1, and Fosl2 (601575)--but not the Jun
proteins (e.g., 165160), rescued the differentiation block in vitro.
Structure-function analysis demonstrated that the major carboxy-terminal
transactivation domains of Fos and FosB are dispensable and that Fosl1,
which lacks transactivation domains, has the highest rescue activity.
Moreover, a transgene expressing Fosl1 rescued the osteopetrosis of Fos
mutant mice in vivo. The osteoclast differentiation factor Rankl
(602642) induced transcription of Fosl1 in a Fos-dependent manner,
thereby establishing a link between Rank signaling and the expression of
Ap1 proteins in osteoclast differentiation.

Kustikova et al. (1998) found a correlation between Fra1 expression and
mesenchymal characteristics in cell lines of epithelial tumor origin.
Exogenous expression of Fra1 in epithelioid cells resulted in
morphologic changes that resembled fibroblastoid conversion, with cells
acquiring elongated shape and increased motility and invasiveness in
vitro. The morphologic alterations were accompanied by transcriptional
activation of genes whose expression is often induced at late stages of
tumor progression.

MAPPING

Sinke et al. (1993) applied the designation 'reverse mapping' to the
identification of a previously known gene within a cosmid for which the
localization was already known. For the identification of sequence
tagged sites (STSs) within cosmid clones derived from the 11q13 region,
they subcloned a number of single-copy BamHI fragments. In one of the
subclones, they found a sequence that matched perfectly with the 5-prime
end of the cDNA sequence for human FRA1. The FRA1 fragment was contained
within a clone previously mapped to region V of a long-range contig map
of 11q13. The localization to chromosome 11 was cross-checked by
hybridization to a panel of somatic cell hybrids. Thus another oncogene
was assigned to the region implicated in a number of different forms of
malignancy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Eferl et al. (2004) noted that Fra1 knockout in mice results in
embryonic death in utero, likely due to placental defects. Using
conditional deletion, they deleted Fra1 throughout mouse embryos, but
not in extraembryonic tissues, such as placenta. Homozygous mutant mice
were viable, but they developed osteopenia due to reduced bone
formation. The numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts were unchanged,
although in vitro and in vivo analysis revealed severely reduced
bone-forming activity of osteoblasts. Eferl et al. (2004) concluded that
the defect was likely due to reduced expression of the bone matrix genes
osteocalcin (112260), collagen-1A2 (120160), and matrix Gla protein
(154870).

610516	TITLE *610516 GLYCERATE KINASE; GLYCTK
;;GLYCTK1
GLYCTK2, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the prokaryotic sequence of glycerate kinase
(EC 2.7.1.31) as query, followed by PCR of a fetal liver cDNA library,
Guo et al. (2006) cloned 2 splice variants of GLYCTK. The longer
variant, GLYCTK1, encodes a deduced 523-amino acid protein. The shorter
variant, GLYCTK2, which lacks exon 4, encodes a deduced 234-amino acid
protein. PCR analysis of 17 human tissues detected variable levels of
both transcripts in all tissues examined. In situ hybridization of adult
mouse tissues showed Glyctk in several specific brain regions, in renal
cortex interstitial cells, in epithelium of the interlobular bile duct,
and in skeletal muscle. Fluorescence-tagged GLYCTK1 and GLYCTK2 were
localized in cytoplasmic particles in transfected COS-7 cells. GLYCTK2,
but not GLYCTK1, localized in mitochondria.

GENE STRUCTURE

Guo et al. (2006) determined that the GLYCTK gene contains 6 exons and
spans more than 4 kb. Exons 1 and 6 are noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Guo et al. (2006) mapped the GLYCTK gene
to chromosome 3p21.

GENE FUNCTION

In the liver of a patient with D-glyceric acidemia (220120), Van
Schaftingen (1989) found that glycerate kinase activity was less than 5%
of normal, whereas D-glycerate dehydrogenase (glyoxylate reductase) and
triokinase activities were normal.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 unrelated patients with D-glyceric aciduria (220120), Sass et al.
(2010) identified 3 different homozygous mutations in the GLYCTK gene
(610516.0001-610516.0003), all occurring in exon 5. In vitro functional
expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the proteins were not
expressed and had no enzymatic activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
D-GLYCERIC ACIDURIA
GLYCTK, 1-BP DEL, 1448T

In fibroblasts taken from the Serbian boy with D-glyceric aciduria
(220120), originally reported by Brandt et al. (1974), Sass et al.
(2010) identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (1448delT) in exon 5 of the
GLYCTK gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature truncation. In
vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the
mutant protein was not expressed and had no enzymatic activity. The
mutation was not found in 214 control chromosomes. Clinical features
reported by Brandt et al. (1974) included neonatal hypotonia, delayed
psychomotor development, mental retardation, and seizures.

.0002
D-GLYCERIC ACIDURIA
GLYCTK, PHE493CYS

In a Mexican girl with D-glyceric aciduria (220120), Sass et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 1478T-G transversion in exon 5 of the GLYCTK
gene, resulting in a phe493-to-cys (F493C) substitution in a highly
conserved residue. In vitro functional expression studies in HEK293
cells showed that the mutant protein was not expressed and had no
enzymatic activity. The mutation was not found in 214 control
chromosomes. The patient was born prematurely and showed hypotonia,
spasticity, microcephaly, seizures, and severe global developmental
delay.

.0003
D-GLYCERIC ACIDURIA
GLYCTK, 1-BP DEL, 1558C

In a Turkish boy, born of consanguineous parents, with D-glyceric
aciduria (220120), Sass et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1-bp
deletion (1558delC) in exon 5 of the GLYCTK gene, resulting in a
frameshift and an extension of protein synthesis, predicted to lead to
degradation. In vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells
showed that the mutant protein was not expressed and had no enzymatic
activity. The mutation was not found in 214 control chromosomes. The
patient also had combined pituitary hormone deficiency-5 (182230), but
was thriving and developing at age 8 weeks.

615507	TITLE *615507 NISCHARIN; NISCH
;;IMIDAZOLINE RECEPTOR ANTISERA-SELECTED; IRAS;;
KIAA0975
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Full-length nischarin is an integrin-binding protein with a role in cell
motility (Alahari et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using antisera developed against nonadrenergic imidazoline-binding
proteins to screen a human hippocampal cDNA expression library, Ivanov
et al. (1998) cloned NISCH. The deduced 595-amino acid protein has 4
transmembrane domains, a zinc finger domain, and a glutamic acid- and
aspartic acid-rich region. NISCH shows regions of similarity with
chromogranin-A precursor (118910) and ryanodine receptor (see RYR1,
180901). Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of 6.0- and
9.5-kb transcripts in all 36 human tissues examined. The smaller
transcript predominated, and highest overall expression was detected in
pituitary. In situ hybridization of rat brain showed strongest
expression in pyramidal cell layers of hippocampus and granular layer
and hillus of the dentate gyrus.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned NISCH, which they designated
KIAA0975. The deduced protein contains 1,528 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected variable NISCH expression in all adult and fetal tissues
examined. Very high expression was detected in fetal brain, followed by
adult kidney, testis, ovary, brain, and spinal cord. Within specific
adult brain regions, highest expression was detected in corpus callosum,
amygdala, cerebellum, and caudate nucleus.

By EST database analysis, Piletz et al. (2003) identified 3 splice
variants of NISCH, which they called IRAS. The transcripts differed in
splicing between exons 13 and 14. The transcript of the primary isoform,
IRAS-M, encodes the full-length 1,504-amino acid protein. The shorter
transcript, IRAS-S, includes an internal polyadenylation signal sequence
and encodes a deduced 515-amino acid protein. The longer truncated
transcript, IRAS-L, encodes a deduced 583-amino acid protein. The 3
proteins are identical for the first 510 amino acids, which includes the
PxxP and leucine-rich repeat domains. Only IRAS-M contains the putative
imidazoline-binding region, alpha-5 integrin (ITGA5; 135620)-binding
domain, and C-terminal domain with similarity to insulin receptor
substrate proteins (see IRS1, 147545). Northern blot analysis detected
IRAS transcripts at 9.5, 5.5, and 3.0 kb in all human brain regions
examined and in spinal cord. In most areas, IRAS-M predominated.
Following expression in CHO cells, SDS-PAGE detected IRAS-M, IRAS-S, and
IRAS-L at apparent molecular masses of 167, 57, and 65 kD, respectively.

Alahari et al. (2004) stated that full-length mouse nischarin is 1,354
amino acids long. It has an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat region,
followed by 2 PxxP motifs, an integrin-binding domain, a central
proline- and alanine-rich domain, and a C-terminal leucine zipper with
an additional PxxP motif. The integrin-binding domain contains a leucine
zipper and a cytochrome P450 (see CYP3A4, 124010) cysteine heme-iron
ligand signature.

GENE FUNCTION

Piletz et al. (2003) found that human IRAS-M and IRAS-L, but not IRAS-S,
increased binding of radiolabeled iodoclonidine to transfected CHO
cells.

Alahari et al. (2004) stated that full-length mouse nischarin interacts
with the cytoplasmic domain of alpha-5 integrin in the alpha-5/beta-1
integrin (ITGB1; 135630) complex and that nischarin inhibits cell
migration when overexpressed. By cotransfecting COS-7 cells, they found
that nischarin also specifically interacted with the kinase domain of
human PAK1 (602590), which is involved in cell motility. Mouse nischarin
and human PAK1 colocalized to membrane ruffles in transfected rat
embryonic fibroblasts. Domain and mutation analysis revealed that an
N-terminal domain of nischarin interacted with PAK1 in the active 'open'
conformation, which normally occurs following Rac (see 602048)-dependent
phosphorylation. Binding to nischarin inhibited PAK1 kinase activity and
cell migration, and the presence of alpha-5/beta-1 integrin further
enhanced the interaction between nischarin and PAK1. Knockout of
nischarin in rat PC12 cells via small interfering RNA resulted in Pak
activation and increased cell migration. Alahari et al. (2004) concluded
that nischarin has a role in regulating cell migration.

Using reciprocal coprecipitation assays, Jain et al. (2013) found that
endogenous nischarin and the kinase LKB1 (STK11; 602216) interacted in
the cytoplasm of human breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of both
nischarin and LKB1 enhanced cell migration, which was due to elevated
PAK1 and LIMK1 (601329) phosphorylation. Absence of nischarin and LKB1
increased breast cancer cell growth following injection in nude mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Piletz et al. (2003) determined that the NISCH gene contains 21 exons
and spans 37 kb. Intron 13 is subject to alternative splicing and
contains stop codons and an internal polyadenylation site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Piletz et al. (2003) mapped the NISCH gene
to chromosome 3p21.1.

604374	TITLE *604374 METALLOTHIONEIN-LIKE 5, TESTIS-SPECIFIC; MTL5
;;TESTIS-SPECIFIC METALLOTHIONEIN-LIKE PROTEIN; TESMIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomized RT-PCR on mRNA from mouse tissues, Sugihara et al. (1999)
isolated a testis-specific transcript, which they called TF1. By
screening a human testis cDNA library with TF1 as a probe, they cloned a
novel cDNA, which they called testis-specific metallothionein-like
protein, or tesmin. Tesmin encodes a predicted cysteine-rich, 295-amino
acid protein that is 76.3% homologous to mouse tesmin. Sequence analysis
revealed the presence of 2 metallothionein (MT)-like motifs. MT
expression has been observed to be higher in testes than in liver tissue
(Salehi-Ashtiani et al., 1993) and to be actively expressed in a
developmentally regulated fashion in mouse male germ cells (De et al.,
1991). Tesmin shows no homology to other testis-specific genes. In situ
hybridization of adult mouse testicular sections showed that expression
of tesmin is restricted to spermatocytes. RT-PCR analysis on testicular
transcripts from mice showed that expression of tesmin occurs as early
as day 8 and coincides with the entry of germ cells in meiosis.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Sugihara et al. (1999) mapped the
MTL5 gene to human chromosome 11q13.2-q13.3 and mouse chromosome 19B.

612612	TITLE *612612 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 2D; LCE2D
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 12; LEP12
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE2D,
which they called LEP12.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected low LCE2D expression
in human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin, as well as in vulva and
esophagus, but not in tongue.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE2 genes, including
LCE2D, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by both
ultraviolet irradiation and calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE2D gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE2D
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce2d gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

613504	TITLE *613504 ZINC FINGER FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 21; ZFYVE21
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 21; ZF21
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using RT-PCR, Nagano et al. (2010) cloned ZFYVE21, which they called
ZF21, from an HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cDNA library. The deduced
234-amino acid protein contains a phosphatidylinositol
3-phosphate-binding FYVE domain in its N-terminal half. Nagano et al.
(2010) also identified a ZF21 splice variant that encodes a deduced
252-amino acid protein. Western blot analysis detected variable
expression of Zf21 in all mouse tissues examined. Expression of the
smaller ZF21 isoform predominated in all human cell lines examined. The
apparent molecular mass of endogenous ZF21 in HT1080 cells was 27 kD.
Biochemical fractionation and immunohistochemical analysis revealed a
vesicle-like distribution for ZF21 and colocalization with EEA1
(605070), an endosome marker protein. Fluorescence microscopy revealed
that ZF21 also colocalized with the focal adhesion marker talin (TLN1;
186745) at the cell surface.

GENE FUNCTION

Nagano et al. (2010) characterized the shorter isoform of ZF21. Using
domain analysis, they showed that the FYVE domain of ZF21 was required
for its membrane localization. Knockdown of ZF21 in human cell lines via
small hairpin RNA increased cell adherence to fibronectin (FN1; 135600),
collagen I (see COL1A1; 120150), and vitronectin (VTN; 193190), but not
poly-L-lysine, and reduced cell motility. Knockdown of ZF21 was
associated with enhanced cell surface expression of integrin beta-1
(ITGB1; 135630) and increased number of focal adhesions. ZF21 did not
affect formation of focal adhesions, but appeared to regulate their
disassembly. Protein pull-down analysis showed that ZF21 interacted with
the focal adhesion protein FAK (PTK2; 600758), and domain analysis
revealed that the FYVE domain of ZF21 interacted with the kinase domain
FAK. Nagano et al. (2010) showed that ZF21 dephosphorylated tyr397 of
FAK, an event crucial for the induction of focal adhesion disassembly.
Dephosphorylation of FAK tyr397 was delayed in ZF21-knockdown cells.
Nagano et al. (2010) concluded that ZF21 regulates focal adhesion
disassembly by initiating microtubule-induced dephosphorylation of FAK
and permitting cell motility.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ZFYVE21 gene to chromosome 14q32.33 based on an
alignment of the ZFYVE21 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC001130) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

601838	TITLE *601838 INOSITOL 1,3,4-TRISPHOSPHATE 5/6-KINASE; ITPK1
;;ITRPK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Based on a bovine peptide sequence, Wilson and Majerus (1996) found a
human EST corresponding to the inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase
gene (ITRPK1). They used this EST to clone the cDNA of ITRPK1 from a
human fetal brain cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a 414-amino acid
polypeptide. Northern blot analysis revealed that ITRPK1 was expressed
as a 3.6-kb message in all tissues tested, with the highest levels in
brain. Expression of the cDNA resulted in inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate
5/6-kinase activity, showing that a single kinase phosphorylates
inositol in both the D5 and D6 positions.

By database searching with the ITPK1 sequence to identify an enzyme with
1-kinase activity, Yang and Shears (2000) also obtained a cDNA encoding
ITPK1 but with a serine replacing asparagine-356. Functional analysis
showed that the variant, which they called the type beta protein, as
well as the protein with asn356, which they called the type alpha
protein, phosphorylated not only the 5- and 6-hydroxy groups of
Ins(1,3,4)P3 but also the 1-hydroxy group of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, suggesting
that the 2 inositol phosphates compete for phosphorylation in vivo. Yang
and Shears (2000) concluded that the same kinase is charged with
performing competing activities that both activate and deactivate a
signaling pathway.

600020	TITLE *600020 MAX-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; MXI1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MAD (600021) and MXI1 genes encode basic helix-loop-helix leucine
zipper transcription factors that bind MAX (154950) in vitro, forming a
sequence-specific DNA-binding complex similar to the MYC-MAX
heterodimer. MXI1 and MAD may antagonize MYC function and are candidate
tumor suppressor genes (Edelhoff et al., 1994).

CLONING

Zervos et al. (1993) isolated the MXI1 as a protein that specifically
interacts with MAX. The MXI1 protein contains a bHLH-ZIP motif that is
similar to that found in Myc family proteins. MXI1 interacts
specifically with MAX to form heterodimers that efficiently bind to the
Myc-MAX consensus recognition site. When bound to DNA by a LexA moiety
in yeast, MXI1 does not stimulate transcription.

Albarosa et al. (1995) concluded that the coding sequence of MXI1 has an
open reading frame that is 28 codons shorter at the 3-prime end than
previously described.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wechsler et al. (1996) showed that MXI1 contains 6 exons and spans
approximately 60 kb.

MAPPING

Edelhoff et al. (1994) mapped the MXI1 gene to human chromosome 10q25
and to mouse chromosome 19 at region D by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). A second site of hybridization on mouse chromosome
2 at region C was thought to represent either a pseudogene or a related
sequence. By FISH, Wechsler et al. (1994) mapped the MXI1 gene to
10q24-q25. Shapiro et al. (1994) confirmed the assignments of the MAD
and MXI1 genes to chromosomes 2p13-p12 and 10q24-q25, respectively, by
somatic cell mapping and FISH.

In the mouse, Steingrimsson et al. (1995) mapped the Mxi1 gene, as well
as those for 4 other bHLH-ZIP transcription factors, by interspecific
backcross analysis. An Mxi1 gene was found to reside on mouse chromosome
19 in an area known to have homology of synteny to human 10q.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Albarosa et al. (1995) found an AAAAC polymorphic repeat in the 3-prime
noncoding region of the gene. Using this polymorphism, they demonstrated
loss of heterozygosity in all of 9 glioblastomas and in none of 6
anaplastic astrocytomas. Glioblastoma multiforme (137800) demonstrates
chromosome 10 changes in a majority of instances.

Since the MXI1 protein negatively regulates MYC oncoprotein activity, it
potentially serves a tumor suppressor function. MXI1 maps to a region of
chromosome 10 that is deleted in some cases of prostate cancer (176807).
This prompted Eagle et al. (1995) to do studies in which they
demonstrated mutations in the retained MXI1 allele in 4 primary prostate
tumors with 10q24-q25 deletions. Two tumors contained inactivating
mutations, whereas 2 others contained the identical missense mutation.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization also demonstrated loss of one MXI1
allele in an additional tumor lacking chromosome 10 abnormalities. MXI1
thus displays allelic loss and mutation in some cases of prostate cancer
that may contribute to the pathogenesis or neoplastic evolution of this
common malignancy. These findings satisfy the Knudson 2-hit hypothesis.

One of the most common chromosomal abnormalities in prostate cancer
involves loss of 10q22-qter. Rarely, a smaller deletion, involving
10q24-q25 has been observed, suggesting the presence of a tumor
suppressor gene at that site. Prochownik et al. (1998) prospectively
evaluated prostate tumors for loss of MXI1 by FISH and cytogenetic
techniques. Of 40 tumors, 21 (53%) demonstrated loss of a single MXI1
allele, as determined by FISH. In 10 cases with cytogenetically normal
long arms of chromosome 10, but with FISH-documented deletion of MXI1, 8
mutations of MXI1 were identified. Five of the mutant proteins were
incapable of binding DNA in association with MAX. Prochownik et al.
(1998) concluded that MXI1 gene loss in prostate cancer is common and
most frequently involves a cytogenetically undetectable deletion.

MXI1 appears to regulate MYC function negatively and therefore is a
potential tumor suppressor gene. Li et al. (1999) screened for MXI1
mutations in solid tumors, including 4 neurofibrosarcomas, and also
examined 29 human tumor cell lines. They discovered a missense mutation,
GCA to GTA (ala54 to val; 600020.0004), in exon 2 in a neurofibrosarcoma
patient; they found 2 different missense mutations in a second
neurofibrosarcoma patient, and 3 amino acid substitutions in a third. In
the last patient, loss of heterozygosity was also demonstrated.
Neurofibrosarcoma is known to develop in patients with neurofibromatosis
type I (NF1; 162200). Li et al. (1999) suggested that MXI1 mutations may
play a role in the pathogenesis of neurofibrosarcoma in NF1; the second
case of 2 mutations in exon 5 occurred in a patient who also had NF1.

ANIMAL MODEL

MXI1 belongs to the family of proteins that function as potent
antagonists of MYC oncoproteins. This antagonism relates to their
ability to compete with MYC for the protein MAX and for consensus DNA
binding sites and to recruit Sin3 proteins (see SIN3A; 607776) and their
associated corepressors. Schreiber-Agus et al. (1998) disrupted the Mxi1
open reading frame in transgenic mice by eliminating an exon required
for the production of the 2 mouse Mxi1 isoforms. They showed that the
mice lacking Mxi1 exhibit progressive multisystem abnormalities. The
mice also showed increased susceptibility to tumorigenesis either
following carcinogen treatment or when also deficient in INK4A (600160).
This cancer-prone phenotype may correspond with the enhanced ability of
several MXI1-deficient cell types, including prostatic epithelium, to
proliferate. The results show that MXI1 is involved in the homeostasis
of differentiated organ systems, acts as a tumor suppressor in vivo, and
engages the MYC network in a functionally relevant manner. In histologic
studies of the mice, Schreiber-Agus et al. (1998) focused particularly
on organs that normally express high or sustained levels of Mxi1, e.g.,
brain, spleen, kidney, and liver, and on tissue types that are
susceptible to tumorigenesis when a putative tumor suppressor is lost
from the 10q24-q26 region; for example, the spleen and thymus are
susceptible to T-cell leukemia, the prostatic epithelium to prostate
cancer, and the brain to glioblastoma multiforme when the 10q24-q26
region is mutated.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PROSTATE CANCER
MXI1, 1-BP DEL, A, CODON 140 OR 141

In a prostate cancer (176807) tumor, Eagle et al. (1995) found loss of a
single alanine at codon 140 or 141, converting AAG (lys) to AGT (ser) in
the ZIP-encoding exon. The frameshift resulted in loss of the terminal
leucine residue of the ZIP domain as well as loss of all additional
downstream amino acid sequences, including those comprising the last 2
alpha-helical turns of the ZIP domain. This was a presumably
inactivating mutation.

.0002
PROSTATE CANCER
MXI1, SPLICE DONOR SITE, GT-GC

In a prostate cancer (176807) tumor, Eagle et al. (1995) observed a
T-to-C transition in the invariant GT dinucleotide of the splice donor
site of the ZIP-encoding exon.

.0003
PROSTATE CANCER
MXI1, GLU152ALA

In prostate cancer (176807) tumors from 2 different patients, Eagle et
al. (1995) found the same mutation, an A-to-C transversion in the second
nucleotide of codon 152 resulting in the nonconservative substitution of
alanine (GCG) for glutamic acid (GAG).

.0004
NEUROFIBROSARCOMA
MXI1, ALA54VAL

Li et al. (1999) identified MXI1 mutations in 3 of 4 neurofibrosarcoma
patients. One of the mutations was a change from GCA to GTA (ala54 to
val) in exon 2. Neurofibrosarcoma is known to develop in patients with
neurofibromatosis type I (162200).

;;MYELODYSPLASIA-MYELOID LEUKEMIA FACTOR 2
DESCRIPTION Kuefer et al. (1996) described a cDNA whose predicted 248-amino acid
protein sequence is approximately 40% identical to myeloid leukemia
factor 1 (601402). Expression of MLF2 was ubiquitous. Kuefer et al.
(1996) mapped the gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization to 12p13, a
region associated with translocations in acute leukemias of lymphoid and
myeloid origin. However, they found no alterations in the structure of
the MLF2 locus in patients shown to have 12p translocations.

614367	TITLE *614367 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 5, BETA-1 SUBUNIT; AP5B1
;;ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 5, BETA SUBUNIT;;
BETA-5;;
DKFZp761E198
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP5B1, or beta-5, appears to be a large subunit of an adaptor protein
complex, AP5, that has a role in endocytosis (Hirst et al., 2011).

CLONING

Using C14ORF108 (MUDENG; 614368) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
placenta cDNA library, Hirst et al. (2011) cloned DKFZp761E198, or
beta-5. The deduced 878-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 94 kD. DKFZp761E198 contains a long N-terminal alpha-helical
solenoid, followed by an unstructured flexible linker and a putative
C-terminal appendage domain. DKFZp761E198 shares significant similarity
with beta-adaptin (see AP1B1; 600157) and beta-COP (COPB; 600959).
Database analysis detected DKFZp761E198 orthologs in at least 2
representatives from each of the 5 major eukaryotic supergroups, but not
in S. cerevisiae.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis of HeLa cell lysates, Hirst et al. (2011) found
that knockdown of DKFZp761E198 via small interfering RNA reduced
expression of C14ORF108. Knockdown of either DKFZp761E198 or C14ORF108
caused relocalization of the lysosomal membrane protein CIMPR (IGF2R;
147280) and the retromere protein VPS26 (605506) from fine puncta to
large perinuclear puncta. Hirst et al. (2011) hypothesized that
DKFZp761E198 functions as a large beta subunit in a novel adaptor
protein complex, AP5, with a role in endocytosis. AP complexes normally
contain a second large subunit, a medium-sized mu subunit, and a small
sigma subunit. Hirst et al. (2011) found that C14ORF108 had
characteristics of an AP5 mu subunit. Therefore, they proposed that
DKFZp761E198 and C14ORF108 be renamed beta-5 and mu-5, respectively.
Hirst et al. (2011) noted that Slabicki et al. (2010) immunoprecipitated
DKFZp761E198 and C14ORF108 with KIAA0415 (613653) and C20ORF29 (AP5S1;
614824) and proposed that KIAA0415 and C20ORF29 may function as the
second large subunit (zeta) and the sigma-5 subunit of AP5,
respectively.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DKFZp761E198 gene to chromosome 11q13.1 based on
an alignment of the DKFZp761E198 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF193040)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

601710	TITLE *601710 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 5; EIF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor-5 (EIF5) interacts with the 40S
initiation complex to promote hydrolysis of bound GTP with concomitant
joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to the 40S initiation complex. The
resulting functional 80S ribosomal initiation complex is then active in
peptidyl transfer and chain elongations (summary by Si et al., 1996).

CLONING

Si et al. (1996) cloned the gene encoding human EIF5. The gene encodes a
predicted 431-amino acid polypeptide that shares significant homology
with the rat sequence. The authors also characterized multiple mRNAs
expressed from the rat EIF5 gene and found that they differ only in the
lengths of their 3-prime untranslated regions. The transcript length
variations are tissue specific and arise from use of alternative
polyadenylation signals.

GENE FUNCTION

Das et al. (2001) characterized recombinant rat Eif5. They identified an
N-terminal GTPase-activating domain in addition to the C-terminal
Eif2-beta (EIF2S2; 603908)-binding region. Mutation analysis revealed 1
critical arginine and 2 critical lysine residues near the N terminus
that were essential for Eif5 function. Das et al. (2001) concluded that
Eif5 functions as a GTPase-activating protein.

EIF5 functions in start site selection as a GTPase accelerating protein
(GAP) for the EIF2-GTP-tRNAi(Met) ternary complex within the
ribosome-bound preinitiation complex (summary by Jennings and Pavitt,
2010). Jennings and Pavitt (2010) defined new regulatory functions of
EIF5 in the recycling of EIF2 from its inactive EIF2-GDP state between
successive rounds of translation initiation. First, the authors showed
that EIF5 stabilizes the binding of GDP to EIF2 and is therefore a
bifunctional protein that acts as a GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI).
Jennings and Pavitt (2010) found that this activity is independent of
the GAP function and identified conserved residues within EIF5 that are
necessary for this role. In addition, Jennings and Pavitt (2010) showed
that EIF5 is a critical component of the EIF2(alpha-P) regulatory
complex that inhibits the activity of the guanine-nucleotide exchange
factor (GEF) EIF2B (603908). Jennings and Pavitt (2010) concluded that
their findings defined a new step in the translation initiation pathway,
one that is critical for normal translational controls.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the EIF5 gene to chromosome 14q32.32 based on an
alignment of the EIF5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK U494936) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

123690	TITLE *123690 CRYSTALLIN, GAMMA-D; CRYGD
;;CRYSTALLIN, GAMMA-4; CRYG4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The crystallin proteins alpha (see 123660), beta (see 123610), and gamma
account for more than 90% of total lens proteins. Different
gamma-crystallin isoforms account for approximately one-third of total
lens proteins (Bloemendal et al., 2004).

MAPPING

Shiloh et al. (1986) localized the gamma-crystallin genes to 2q33-q36,
most probably 2q34-q35, by Southern analysis of DNA from somatic cell
hybrids and by in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 3-generation family with hereditary progressive cataracts (115700),
Stephan et al. (1999) performed a genomewide search and obtained
evidence for linkage at chromosome 2q33-q35, where the gamma-crystallin
genes are located. They then looked for mutations in 2 gamma-crystallins
that are expressed at high levels in the developing lens, mainly
gamma-crystallins C (CRYGC; 123680) and D. They discovered a 1-base
alteration that resulted in an arg14-to-cys substitution in
gamma-D-crystallin (123690.0001). Protein modeling suggested that the
effect of this mutation was a subtle one, affecting the surface
properties of the crystallin molecule rather than its tertiary
structure, consistent with the fact that the patients' lenses were
normal at birth. This was the first gene defect shown to be responsible
for a noncongenital progressive cataract.

In affected members of 3 families segregating aculeiform cataract, Heon
et al. (1999) identified an arg58-to-his (R58H; 123690.0002) mutation in
the CRYGD gene.

Kmoch et al. (2000) described a 5-year-old boy with a unique congenital
cataract caused by deposition of numerous birefringent, pleochroic, and
macroscopically prismatic crystals. Crystal analysis with subsequent
Edman degradation and mass spectrometry identified the protein as
gamma-D-crystallin lacking the N-terminal methionine. Sequencing of the
CRYGD gene revealed heterozygosity for a C-to-A transversion at position
109 of the inferred cDNA, resulting in an arg36-to-ser substitution
(R36S; 123690.0003). Although the crystal structure solution at 2.25
angstroms suggested that mutant R36S CRYGD has an unaltered protein
fold, the observed crystal packing was possible only with the mutant
protein molecules lacking the bulky arg36 side chain. This was the first
described case of human cataract caused by crystallization of a protein
in the lens.

Pande et al. (2001) used the term crystal cataract for those produced by
mutation in the CRYGD gene with demonstrable crystallization of the
mutant protein. They showed that the R58H (123690.0002) and R36S
(123690.0003) mutant proteins are much less soluble than wildtype human
gamma-D-crystallin protein. They also showed that these mutants are more
prone to crystallization than the wildtype.

In a father and daughter with congenital lamellar cataract, Santhiya et
al. (2002) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the CRYGD gene
(P23T; 123690.0004).

Nandrot et al. (2003) found P23T mutation in the CRYGD gene in a
4-generation Moroccan family with autosomal dominant congenital cerulean
cataract. The authors showed that although x-ray crystallography
modeling did not indicate any change of the backbone conformation, the
mutation affected a region of the Greek key motif that was important for
determining the topology of this protein fold. The data strongly
suggested that the P23T mutation might alter the protein folding or
decrease the thermodynamic stability or solubility of the protein.

A different mutation in the same codon (P23S; 123690.0007) was found by
Plotnikova et al. (2007) to be the basis of the polymorphic congenital
cataract reported by Rogaev et al. (1996) in a central Asian population
of mixed white and Mongolian ancestry. The cataract-associated serine at
site 23 corresponds to the ancestral state, since it was found in CRYGD
of a lower primate (S. labiatus) and all surveyed nonprimate mammals.
Crystallin proteins include 2 structurally similar domains, and
substitutions in mammalian CRYGD protein at site 23 of the first domain
were always associated with substitutions in the structurally reciprocal
sites 109 and 136 of the second domain. These data suggested that the
cataractogenic effect of serine at site 23 in the N-terminal domain of
CRYGD may be compensated indirectly by amino acid changes in a distal
domain. Plotnikova et al. (2007) also found that gene conversion was a
factor in the evolution of the gamma-crystallin gene cluster throughout
different mammalian clades. The high rate of gene conversion observed
between the functional CRYGD gene and 2 primate gamma-crystallin
pseudogenes (CRYGEP1 and CRYGFP1) coupled with a surprising finding of
apparent negative selection in primate pseudogenes suggested a
deleterious impact of recently derived pseudogenes involved in gene
conversion in gamma-crystallin gene cluster.

McManus et al. (2007) found that CRYGD proteins with cataract-associated
mutations of pro23 became less soluble as temperature increased, in
dramatic contrast to the native protein. As a result, the mutant
proteins had much lower solubilities at body temperature than the native
protein.

In affected members of a Danish family segregating autosomal dominant
congenital cataract and microcornea, Hansen et al. (2007) identified a
heterozygous nonsense mutation in the CRYGD gene (Y134X; 123690.0008).

- Nomenclature of Allelic Variants

Hansen et al. (2007) noted that until September 2007 the systematic name
for all CRYGD mutations (except the E107A mutation) used the N-terminal
processed CRYGD protein, which starts with glycine at position 2 in the
translated mRNA. Based on the numbering system established by den Dunnen
and Antonarakis (2001), however, the first methionine in the coding
sequence should be assigned position 1, and the adenosine in the
corresponding start ATG codon should be assigned position +1. This
change in numbering is reflected in the relevant allelic variants
included below.

ANIMAL MODEL

In an ongoing program to identify new mouse models of hereditary eye
disease, Smith et al. (2000) identified a semidominant form of cataract
consisting of an irregular opacity of the nuclear lens thought to be
similar to the human Coppock cataract (see 604307). The cataract
phenotype mapped to mouse chromosome 1 in the vicinity of the
gamma-crystallin gene cluster. Using a systemic candidate gene approach
to analyze the entire Cryg cluster, a G-to-A transition was found in
exon 3 of Crygd associated with the Lop12 mutation. The mutation led to
the formation of an in-frame stop codon that produced a truncated
protein of 156 amino acids. It was predicted that the defective gene
product would alter protein folding of the gamma-crystallins and result
in lens opacity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CATARACT 4, PUNCTATE
CRYGD, ARG15CYS

Based on a new numbering system, this variant has been changed from
ARG14CYS to ARG15CYS; see Hansen et al. (2007).

Stephan et al. (1999) found an arg14-to-cys (R14C) missense mutation in
the CRYGD gene in affected members of a family with autosomal dominant
punctate cataract of early postnatal onset and progressive nature
(CTRCT4; 115700).

To gain understanding of how the R14C mutation leads to cataract, Pande
et al. (2000) expressed recombinant wildtype human gamma-D crystallin
and its R14C mutant form in Escherichia coli and showed that R14C forms
disulfide-linked oligomers, which markedly raised the phase separation
temperature of the protein solution. Eventually, R14C precipitated. In
contrast, the wildtype version slowly formed only disulfide-linked
dimers and no oligomers. These data strongly suggested that the observed
cataract is triggered by the thiol-mediated aggregation of R14C. The
aggregation profiles of the wildtype and mutant forms were consistent
with homology modeling studies that revealed that R14C contains 2
exposed cysteine residues, whereas wildtype has only 1. Studies showed
that the wildtype and R14C mutant forms had nearly identical secondary
and tertiary structures and stabilities. Thus, contrary to commonly held
views at the time, Pande et al. (2000) concluded that unfolding or
destabilization of the protein was not necessary for cataractogenesis.

.0002
CATARACT 4, ACULEIFORM
CRYGD, ARG59HIS

Based on a new numbering system, this variant has been changed from
ARG58HIS to ARG59HIS; see Hansen et al. (2007).

Heon et al. (1999) found that a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 411 of
the CRYGD gene, resulting in an arg58-to-his substitution, segregated
with the phenotype of aculeiform cataract (CTRCT4; 115700) in 3 affected
families.

.0003
CATARACT 4, CRYSTALLINE
CRYGD, ARG37SER

Based on a new numbering system, this variant has been changed from
ARG36SER to ARG37SER; see Hansen et al. (2007).

Kmoch et al. (2000) described a 5-year-old boy with a juvenile-onset
crystalline cataract (CTRCT4; 115700) caused by deposition of numerous
birefringent, pleochroic, and macroscopically prismatic crystals.
Protein analysis identified the material as gamma-D-crystallin, and
sequencing of the CRYGD gene revealed heterozygosity for a C-to-A
transversion at position 109 of the inferred cDNA, resulting in an
arg36-to-ser substitution.

.0004
CATARACT 4, MULTIPLE TYPES
CRYGD, PRO24THR

Based on a new numbering system, this variant has been changed from
PRO23THR to PRO24THR; see Hansen et al. (2007).

In a father and daughter with congenital lamellar cataracts (CTRCT4;
115700), Santhiya et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for a 70C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the CRYGD gene, predicted to lead to a
pro23-to-thr (P23T) substitution.

In a 4-generation Moroccan family with congenital cerulean cataract,
Nandrot et al. (2003) found that a C-to-A transversion in exon 2 of the
CRYGD gene, resulting in a P23T substitution, segregated with the
phenotype. The authors indicated the nucleotide change as 305C-A but
noted that this was the same mutation as that found by Santhiya et al.
(2002).

.0005
CATARACT 4, CENTRAL NUCLEAR
CRYGD, TRP157TER

Based on a new numbering system, this variant has been changed from
TRP156TER to TRP157TER; see Hansen et al. (2007).

In a father and daughter with congenital central nuclear cataract
(CTRCT4; 115700), Santhiya et al. (2002) found heterozygosity for a
nonsense mutation in the CRYGD gene: a 470G-A transition leading to a
premature stop at codon 156 (W156X).

In a large kindred of mixed white and Mongolian origin with polymorphic
congenital cataract (CTRCT4; 115700), Plotnikova et al. (2007) found a
70C-T transition in exon 2 of the CRYGD gene that resulted in a
pro23-to-ser (P23S) substitution.

.0008
CATARACT 4 WITH MICROCORNEA
CRYGD, TYR134TER

In affected members of a Danish family segregating autosomal dominant
congenital cataract and microcornea (CTRCT4; 115700), Hansen et al.
(2007) identified heterozygosity for a c.418C-A transversion in exon 3
of the CRYGD gene, resulting in a tyr134-to-ter (Y134X) substitution.
The mutation was not found in 170 ethnically matched controls.

;;NIPPED-B, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;

SISTER CHROMATID COHESION 2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SCC2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sister chromatids remain connected following duplication in S phase
until they segregate during anaphase of mitosis or meiosis II. This
cohesion counteracts the force of spindle microtubules on sister
kinetochores and allows chromosomes to align at the mitotic spindle.
Sister chromatid cohesion is also essential for segregation of
homologous chromosomes during meiosis I and for repair of DNA
double-strand breaks during G2 phase. Cohesin (see 606462) is a protein
complex required for sister chromatid cohesion. NIPBL forms a dimer with
MAU2 (614560) that is essential for loading the cohesin complex onto
sister chromatids (Watrin et al., 2006).

CLONING

In the course of searching for the molecular basis of the Cornelia de
Lange syndrome (CDLS; 122470), Tonkin et al. (2004) and Krantz et al.
(2004) analyzed de novo balanced translocations associated with Cornelia
de Lange syndrome and identified a novel gene at 5p13.1 that is
disrupted in these cases. Tonkin et al. (2004) designated the product of
the Nipped-B-like (NIPBL) gene 'delangin.' The coding sequence commences
in exon 2 and continues either to exon 47, generating a long isoform
(2,804 amino acids), or to an expanded variant of exon 46, generating a
slightly shorter isoform (2,697 amino acids). Residues 1 through 2,683
of the short and long isoforms are identical; the short isoform contains
a 14-amino acid C-terminal end that is unrelated to the 121-amino acid
C-terminal end of the long isoform (Tonkin et al., 2004). Northern blot
analysis showed that NIPBL is strongly expressed in fetal and adult
kidney, fetal liver, adult placenta, heart, skeletal muscle, and thymus,
but weakly or almost undetectably expressed in fetal and adult brain and
lung and in adult liver, colon, small intestine, and leukocytes (Tonkin
et al., 2004). Tonkin et al. (2004) found that vertebrate delangins have
substantial homology to orthologs in flies, worms, plants, and fungi,
including Scc2-type sister chromatid cohesion proteins, and D.
melanogaster Nipped-B.

Using bioinformatic analysis, Yan et al. (2006) showed that NIPBL
protein contains an N-terminal caldesmon (CALD1; 114213) domain, a
calponin (CNN1; 600806) domain, and 2 calmodulin (CALM1; 114180)-binding
motifs, followed by a nuclear localization signal, a nuclear export
signal, 5 HEAT repeats, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain.

GENE FUNCTION

In situ hybridization to whole mouse embryos detected Nipbl transcripts
at gestation days 9.5 and 10.5, with notable accumulations in limb bud,
branchial arch, and craniofacial mesenchyme (Krantz et al., 2004). In
situ hybridization to human embryonic tissue sections revealed an
expression pattern largely consistent with the CDLS phenotype (Tonkin et
al., 2004). Krantz et al. (2004) found evidence for alternative splicing
of the NIPBL gene in the presence of multiple transcripts detected on
Northern blot analysis.

The evolution of an ancestral sister chromatid cohesion protein to
acquire an additional role in developmental gene regulation suggested to
Tonkin et al. (2004) that there are parallels between CDLS and Roberts
syndrome (268300), which is characterized by growth retardation, limb
reduction defects, craniofacial abnormalities, and premature centromere
separation. A dual role for Nipped-B in sister chromatid cohesion and
developmental regulation was confirmed by Rollins et al. (2004).

By metaphase spread analysis, Kaur et al. (2005) found evidence of
precocious sister chromatid separation (PSCS) in 37 (41%) of 90 probands
with CDLS compared to 8 (9%) of controls. Of the 37 CDLS patients with
PSCS, 16 (43%) had mutations in the NIPBL gene, whereas 21 (57%) did
not. Both severe and mild phenotypes were seen in those with PSCS and
those without PSCS. Kaur et al. (2005) noted that Roberts syndrome
(268300), which has phenotypic overlap with CDLS and is associated with
premature sister chromatid separation, is caused by mutations in the
ESCO2 gene (609353), which is required for proper establishment of the
sister chromatid cohesion complex.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Watrin et al. (2006) showed that
SCC4 (MAU2) interacted with SCC2 in HeLa cell nucleoplasmic extracts.
SCC4 and SCC2 cosedimented in fractionated HeLa cell extracts and
colocalized on chromatin in HeLa cells during interphase and telophase.
Depletion of either SCC4 or SCC2 via small interfering RNA delayed
mitotic exit and caused loss of cohesin from chromatin during interphase
and telophase, precocious loss of sister chromatid cohesion,
misalignment of chromosomes, appearance of single sister chromatids, and
prometaphase arrest. Knockdown of either SCC4 or SCC2 also reduced the
amount of the other protein, suggesting that physical association
between them is required for stability. Chromosomes in SCC4- or
SCC2-depleted cells lacked cohesin despite the presence of the cohesin
protectors SGO1 (SGOL1; 609168) and BUB1 (602452).

Independently, Seitan et al. (2006) showed that MAU2
coimmunoprecipitated with delangin. Drosophila and Xenopus orthologs of
MAU2 and delangin also interacted directly. Protein truncation and yeast
2-hybrid analyses revealed that the N termini of MAU2 and delangin
mediated their interaction. Knockdown of MAU2 in HeLa cells resulted in
increased frequency of precocious sister chromatid separation. In
control cells, release from block in G2/M resulted in rapid loading of
cohesin subunits onto chromatin. In MAU2 knockdown cells, cohesin
complexes formed, but they failed to load onto chromatin.

Kagey et al. (2010) reported that Mediator (see MED8, 607956) and
cohesin (see SMC1, 300040) physically and functionally connect the
enhancers and core promoters of active genes in murine embryonic stem
cells. Mediator, a transcriptional coactivator, forms a complex with
cohesin, which can form rings that connect 2 DNA segments. The
cohesin-loading factor NIPBL is associated with Mediator-cohesin
complexes, providing a means to load cohesin at promoters. DNA looping
is observed between the enhancers and promoters occupied by Mediator and
cohesin. Mediator and cohesin co-occupy different promoters in different
cells, thus generating cell type-specific DNA loops linked to the gene
expression program of each cell.

GENE STRUCTURE

The NIPBL gene contains 47 exons spanning 188 kb, with commencement of
the coding sequence in exon 2 (Krantz et al., 2004; Tonkin et al.,
2004).

MAPPING

Krantz et al. (2004) and Tonkin et al. (2004) identified the NIPBL gene
within chromosome 5p13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tonkin et al. (2004) studied CDLS cases without translocations and
identified 9 plausible point mutations, at least 5 of which arose de
novo. As they found NIPBL mutations in individuals with severe and mild
CDLS, phenotypic variation may be explained in part by allelic
heterogeneity. The spectrum and distribution of mutations implied that
pathogenesis arose from loss or altered function of a single NIPBL
allele. The mutation detection rate in the study of Tonkin et al. (2004)
was approximately 50%. Thus, locus heterogeneity as well as allelic
heterogeneity may be present, but limitations of the screening methods
were also cited as a plausible explanation for the comparatively low
mutation detection rate. On the other hand, considerable intrafamilial
variation in phenotype of CDLS, even between affected sibs
(Krajewska-Walasek et al., 1995), suggests that additional factors may
be important. Tonkin et al. (2004) proposed that perturbed delangin
function may inappropriately activate distal-less homeobox (DLX) genes,
thereby contributing to the proximodistal limb patterning defects in
CDLS.

Krantz et al. (2004) identified 6 point mutations in individuals with
CDLS (608667.0001-608667.0006). All were expected to result in a
truncated or, in the case of the met1-to-lys mutation (M1K;
608667.0001), an untranslated protein.

Gillis et al. (2004) described the spectrum and distribution of NIPBL
mutations in a large well-characterized cohort of individuals with CDLS.
In 56 (47%) of 120 unrelated individuals with sporadic or familial CDLS,
they identified mutations in the NIPBL gene (see
608667.0007-608667.0012). In 49 (46%) of the 106 individuals with
sporadic CDLS, 44 different mutations were identified, 14 (32%) of which
were small deletions. In 6 the 7 familial cases of CDLS in which NIPBL
mutations were identified, germline mosaicism was considered the likely
mechanism for the occurrence of affected sibs with mutation-negative
parents.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Gillis et al. (2004) found statistically significant phenotypic
differences between mutation-positive and mutation-negative individuals
with CDLS. Analysis also suggested a trend toward a milder phenotype in
individuals with missense mutations.

Yan et al. (2006) identified 13 different NIPBL mutations, including 11
novel mutations, in 13 (46%) of 28 Polish patients with a clinical
diagnosis of CDLS. Eleven of the mutations resulted in a premature
termination of the protein. Mutation-positive patients were more
severely affected than mutation-negative patients with respect to
prenatal growth, facial dysmorphism, and speech impairment.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, MET1LYS

In 3 sibs with CDLS (122470), each with a different father, Krantz et
al. (2004) identified a start codon mutation, 2G-A (M1K), in the NIPBL
gene. The mutation was not present in their mother or in the 2 fathers
from whom samples were available. All 3 sibs, ages 17, 8, and 3 years,
had moderate growth and cognitive delays, small hands without reduction
defects, hirsutism, and typical facial features. Germline mosaicism was
presumably the mechanism for the familial recurrence since the mother
had not manifested features of the disorder.

.0002
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, TYR2430CYS

In an individual with classic features of CDLS (122470), Tonkin et al.
(2004) identified a 7289A-G transition in exon 43 of the NIPBL gene
resulting in a tyr2430-to-cys (Y2430C) amino acid change in the delangin
protein. The patient showed severe growth retardation, lobster limb
defect, characteristic face, feeding difficulties, and gastroesophageal
reflux.

.0003
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, 1-BP DEL, 150G

In a child with CDLS (122470), Krantz et al. (2004) identified a 1-bp
deletion, 150delG, in exon 3 of the NIPBL gene, resulting in frameshift
with a stop codon 28 amino acids downstream. The male child, seen at 4.5
months of age, had severe bilateral upper limb reduction defects
(oligodactyly, single digit), severe growth and cognitive delays,
typical facial features, hirsutism, and cleft palate.

.0004
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, 1-BP INS, 7306G

In a patient with classic features of CDLS (122470), Tonkin et al.
(2004) found a de novo 1-bp insertion, 7306_7307insG, in exon 43 of the
NIPBL gene. The patient showed growth retardation, microbrachycephaly,
long philtrum, thin lips, crescent-shaped mouth, synophrys, bushy
eyebrows, general hirsutism, hearing impairment, myopia, micromelia,
clinodactyly, proximally placed thumbs, fixed flexion of the elbows,
syndactyly of the feet, bilateral inguinal hernias, and undescended
testes.

.0005
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, 1-BP INS, 1546G

In an adult female with classic features of CDLS (122470), Krantz et al.
(2004) identified a 1-bp insertion, 1546_1547insG, in exon 10 of the
NIPBL gene. The insertion resulted in a frameshift with a stop codon 3
amino acids downstream. The patient showed severe growth and cognitive
delays, reduction defect of the right limb (oligodactyly, 4 digits) and
small left hand with no reduction defect, typical facial features,
hirsutism, cleft palate, and hearing loss.

.0006
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, ILE1206DEL

In a patient with mild features of CDLS (122470), Tonkin et al. (2004)
described a 3-bp deletion of nucleotides 3616 through 3618 in exon 14 of
the NIPBL gene (ATA) resulting in deletion of isoleucine-1206. The
change was absent in maternal DNA; no paternal DNA was available. The
patient showed growth retardation, small hands, microcephaly, speech
delay, and inguinal hernia.

.0007
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, 2-BP DEL, 2479AG

In 2 unrelated children with sporadic CDLS (122470), Gillis et al.
(2004) identified a 2-bp deletion in exon 10 of the NIPBL gene,
2479delAG, resulting in a frameshift and truncation of the protein 2
amino acids downstream. Both children were severely affected in terms of
growth and development; however, one had significant limb reduction
defects whereas the other did not.

.0008
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, ARG1723TER

In 2 affected brothers from a family with CDLS (122470) previously
reported by Krantz et al. (2004), Gillis et al. (2004) identified an
arg1723-to-ter (R1723X) substitution in exon 26 of the NIPBL gene.

.0009
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, ALA1246GLY

Krantz et al. (2001) described male first cousins from a family with
CDLS (122470), the sons of unaffected sisters, who were excluded from
linkage analysis because of the atypical inheritance pattern. In the 2
affected males, Gillis et al. (2004) identified different de novo
mutations in the NIPBL gene, neither of which was present in the
parents: in one, an ala1246-to-gly (A1246G) substitution in exon 15, and
in the other, a 7861G-C transversion at position -1 in the intron
upstream of exon 46 (608667.0010).

.0011
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, IVS44DS, A-G, +4

In affected members of a family with CDLS (122470) previously described
by Krantz et al. (2004), Gillis et al. (2004) identified a 7321A-G
transition at position +4 of exon 43 of the NIPBL gene. The mutation was
identified in 2 of 4 affected sibs from whom samples were available, as
well as in the mildly affected mother.

.0012
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, ARG1536TER

In 3 unrelated patients with sporadic CDLS (122470), Gillis et al.
(2004) identified an arg1536-to-ter (R1536X) substitution in exon 22 of
the NIPBL gene.

.0013
CORNELIA DE LANGE SYNDROME 1
NIPBL, 2-BP DEL/1-BP INS

Borck et al. (2006) screened 21 CDLS (122470) patients with no
previously identified NIPBL anomaly for mutations in the 5-prime
untranslated region and the proximal promoter of the NIPBL gene. They
identified a heterozygous deletion-insertion mutation in exon 1, 321
nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon
(-321_-320delCCinsA) in an affected girl and her mildly affected father.
The CC dinucleotide and the surrounding sequence are highly conserved in
mammalian NIPBL homologs. The deletion-insertion variant was not
identified in either parent of the father. The affected child was the
first offspring of parents who were related as second cousins
originating from Algeria. The diagnosis was made in the neonatal period
because of characteristic dysmorphic facial features. The father had had
feeding problems and gastroesophageal reflux in infancy, as did the
proband. He also had developmental delay and speech delay, with his
first words spoken at age 3 years, 6 months. At 7 years of age he was
operated on for subvalvular aortic stenosis. He had growth retardation
with a final height of 152 cm. The heights of his father and mother were
168 cm and 152 cm, respectively. Dysmorphic features in the father
included arched eyebrows with synophrys, long eyelashes, long nose, and
thin upper lip.

601960	TITLE *601960 CHEMOKINE, CC MOTIF, LIGAND 20; CCL20
;;SMALL INDUCIBLE CYTOKINE SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 20; SCYA20;;
EXODUS 1;;
MACROPHAGE INFLAMMATORY PROTEIN 3-ALPHA; MIP3A;;
LARC
DESCRIPTION Chemokines are basic, heparin-binding proteins of 8 to 12 kD that have 4
cysteines conserved among all family members. Hromas et al. (1997) noted
that the chemokine family is subdivided on the basis of where the first
2 cysteines are located. If they are separated by a single amino acid,
they are classified as the alpha family (also called C-X-C). If they are
adjacent to each other, they are classified as the beta family (also
called C-C). Members of the alpha family are located in a gene cluster
on 4q12-q21; the beta-family members are in a cluster on 17q11-q32.
Chemokines have been shown to regulate leukocyte infiltration into
inflamed tissue. Some chemokines, such as MIP-1-alpha (182283), also
inhibit hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation. Three chemokines,
MIP-1-alpha, MIP-1-beta (182284), and RANTES (187011), have been found
to decrease significantly HIV production; several receptors for these
chemokines (e.g., CMKBR5; 601373) function as cell coreceptors for
HIV-1.

CLONING

Hromas et al. (1997) reported the cloning and characterization of a
novel human chemokine that they termed 'Exodus' for its chemotactic
properties. The full-length cDNA encodes a 95-amino acid polypeptide
that includes a 22-amino acid putative signal sequence. This novel
chemokine has approximately 28% homology with MIP-1-alpha and RANTES,
and shares several of their biologic activities. Exodus is expressed
preferentially in lymphocytes and monocytes, and its expression is
markedly upregulated by mediators of inflammation such as tumor necrosis
factor (TNF; 191160) and lipopolysaccharide. Purified synthetic Exodus
inhibited proliferation of myeloid progenitors in colony formation
assays. Exodus also stimulated chemotaxis of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. The sequence homology, expression, and biologic
activity indicated that Exodus represents a novel, divergent
beta-chemokine.

Rossi et al. (1997) identified the Exodus chemokine, which they termed
MIP-3-alpha for 'macrophage inflammatory protein-3-alpha.'

Nelson et al. (2001) identified 2 variants of CCL20 that are derived by
use of alternative splice acceptor sites. One variant, isolated from
myeloid leukemia cells, T lymphocytes, and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
monocyte RNA, contains an N-terminal alanine following removal of the
signal sequence. The second variant, isolated from liver, contains an
in-frame deletion of 3 bases that correspond to this alanine. The
deletion results in a protein that is shorter by 1 amino acid and
contains an N-terminal serine in the mature protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, Homey et al.
(2000) demonstrated that MIP3A, or CCL20, and its receptor, CCR6
(601835), are markedly upregulated in psoriasis (see 177900) and that
CCL20-expressing keratinocytes colocalize with CLA-positive (see PSGL1;
600738) skin-infiltrating T lymphocytes in lesional psoriatic skin. By
flow cytometry analysis, they showed that circulating CLA-positive
memory T cells in both normal and psoriatic individuals expressed high
levels of surface CCR6, which was expressed 100- to 1,000-fold higher
than other chemokine receptors on this T-cell subpopulation. CCL20 was
chemotactic for CLA-positive T cells at lower concentrations in
psoriatic than in normal donor lymphocytes. ELISA and RT-PCR analysis
showed that multiple cellular constituents of the skin produce CCL20 in
response to a variety of proinflammatory mediators, including TNF/IL1B
(147720), CD40LG (300386), IFNG (147570), and IL17 (603149).

Nelson et al. (2001) assayed the activity of the alanine-CCL20 and
serine-CCL20 splice variants toward several human peripheral blood
leukocytes. These chemokines showed negligible activity toward
neutrophils, monocytes, and naive T lymphocytes. However, flu antigen
plus IL2 (147680)-activated CD4+ (186940), and CD8+ (186910) T
lymphoblasts and cord blood-derived dendritic cells responded to both
forms of CCL20. Both forms exerted a dose-dependent effect on
recruitment of activated T cells and on intracellular calcium
mobilization.

Reboldi et al. (2009) found that Ccr6-deficient mice were highly
resistant to induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis (MS; 126200), but became
susceptible after transfer of small numbers of Ccr6-positive T cells.
Ccr6 was required on the first wave of Il17 (603149)-producing T-helper
cells (Th17 cells) entering the central nervous system (CNS) through
Ccl20-expressing epithelial cells in the choroid plexus. The
Ccr6-positive T cells triggered entry of a second wave of T cells that
migrated in large numbers into the CNS by crossing activated parenchymal
vessels. Reboldi et al. (2009) found that patients undergoing an initial
demyelinating event (the first clinical episode of MS) had significantly
higher frequencies of CCR6-positive/CD25 (IL2RA;
147730)-negative/CD4-positive inflammatory T cells in cerebrospinal
fluid than in peripheral blood. MS patients expressed high levels of
CCL20 in inflamed tissues, in GFAP (137780)-positive astrocytes, and in
choroid plexus. Reboldi et al. (2009) proposed that CCR6 and CCL20 may
represent an evolutionarily conserved axis that regulates the entry and
dissemination of T cells into the CNS.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nelson et al. (2001) determined that the CCL20 gene contains 4 exons.
The promoter region contains a TATA box, a TFIID (313650)-binding site,
overlapping AP2 (107580)-binding sites and an SV40 T antigen-binding
site. Harant et al. (2001) identified a putative CAAT-box and other
potential binding sites. By several criteria, they identified a
functional NF-kappa-B (164014) element that responded to TNF-alpha
stimulation. Kwon et al. (2003) identified a site that regulated both
basal and cytokine-induced gene activation and bound the ETS nuclear
factor ESE1 (ELF3;602191).

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybridization and radiation hybrid analysis, Hieshima et
al. (1997) mapped the CCL20 (formerly SCYA20) gene to 2q33-q37. By FISH,
Nelson et al. (2001) mapped the CCL20 gene to chromosome 2q35-q36.

602972	TITLE *602972 PHOSPHODIESTERASE 8A; PDE8A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate the intracellular levels of cAMP and
cGMP. These cyclic nucleotides play an important role as second
messengers in multiple physiologic processes, including regulation of
vascular resistance, cardiac output, visceral motility, immune response,
inflammation, neuroplasticity, vision, and reproduction. PDEs comprise a
large superfamily of enzymes divided into 10 families. Different PDEs
can be distinguished by their structure, tissue expression,
localization, substrate specificity, regulation, and sensitivity to PDE
inhibitors. Diversity in structure and specificity of function make PDEs
promising targets for the pharmacotherapy of diseases modulated by
cyclic nucleotide signaling (Hetman et al., 2000). See 171885.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for clones with homology to the catalytic
domain of PDE4B (600127), Fisher et al. (1998) identified apparently
partial cDNAs encoding 713 amino acids of a novel PDE. Sequence
comparisons revealed that the predicted catalytic domain shared only 20
to 39% sequence identity with those of 7 previously identified PDE
families. Therefore, the authors designated the protein PDE8A. Using
Northern blots, Fisher et al. (1998) determined that PDE8A is expressed
as an approximately 4.5-kb mRNA in a wide variety of tissues. A
recombinant protein containing the 545 C-terminal amino acids of PDE8A
displayed very high affinity cAMP-specific PDE activity. Unlike PDE4 and
PDE7, the other high affinity cAMP-specific PDEs, PDE8A was not
inhibited by IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine).

Wang et al. (2001) cloned 5 PDE8A splice variants from testis and normal
human T-cell cDNA libraries. The variants, called PDE8A1 through PDE8A5,
share a common 5-prime sequence but differ from each other by the
presence or absence of exons 7 through 9. Full-length PDE8A protein,
which they called PDE8A1, has has 829 amino acids and a calculated
molecular mass of 93.3 kD. It has an N-terminal REC domain and PAS
domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. It also contains several sites
for protein phosphorylation, N-glycosylation, N-myristoylation, and
amidation. Mouse Pde8a1 contains a nuclear localization sequence not
found in human PDE8A1. PDE8A2 contains 783 amino acids and has a
calculated molecular mass of 88.3 kD. PDE8A3 contains 449 amino acids
and has a calculated molecular mass of 51.3 kD, and PDE8A4 and PDE8A5
encode identical 582-amino acid proteins with a calculated molecular
mass of 66.0 kD. The isoforms differ from each other in the deletion or
insertion of sequences in the PAS domains; PDE8A3 lacks the entire PAS
domain. Only PDE8A1 and PDE8A2 were evaluated for tissue distribution.
Real-time quantitative PCR detected both transcripts in all human
tissues examined with expression levels of PDE8A1 much higher than that
of PDE8A2. PDE8A1 and PDE8A2 showed highest expression in testis and
spleen, respectively, and both showed lowest expression in skeletal
muscle and bone marrow. By in situ hybridization of mouse testis, Vasta
et al. (2006) showed Pde8a was expressed specifically in Leydig cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2001) determined that the PDE8A gene contains 23 exons and
spans over 80 kb. The 5-prime region of the PDE8A is GC-rich, and it
contains a TATA box and numerous transcription factor binding sites,
including some involved in cAMP-responsive transcriptional regulation
and in expression of genes in T cells.

MAPPING

Wang et al. (2001) noted that the PDE8A gene maps to chromosome
15q25.3-q26.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Vasta et al. (2006) showed that knockdown of Pde8a in mice altered
luteinizing hormone (LH; see LHB 152780) signaling and steroidogenesis.
In Pde8a-knockout Leydig cells, they found a 4-fold increase in
sensitivity to LH for testosterone production. They concluded that PDE8A
plays a role in setting the sensitivity to LH for testosterone
production

605963	TITLE *605963 SORTING NEXIN 17; SNX17
DESCRIPTION SNX17 is a member of the sorting nexin family of molecules that contain
a conserved, approximately 100-amino acid phox (PX) domain Florian et
al. (2001).

CLONING

Using the cytoplasmic tail of P-selectin (173610) as bait in a 2-hybrid
screen of a human placenta cDNA library, Florian et al. (2001) isolated
a cDNA, which they called SNX17, with sequence identity to a full-length
cDNA reported as KIAA0064 by Nomura et al. (1994). Northern blot
analysis detected ubiquitous expression of SNX17 (Nomura et al., 1994).
Florian et al. (2001) found that the deduced 470-amino acid SNX17
protein contains a PX domain that shares 28% sequence identity with the
PX domain of sorting nexin-1 (601272) as well as a B41 (FERM) domain.
Expression of a GFP-SNX17 fusion protein demonstrated localization of
SNX17 in the cytosol and on membranes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SNX17
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP WI-7933).

GENE FUNCTION

Florian et al. (2001) found that the FERM domain may be necessary for
interaction of SNX17 with the cytoplasmic tail of P-selectin.

610292	TITLE *610292 B-CELL SCAFFOLD PROTEIN WITH ANKYRIN REPEATS 1; BANK1
;;FLJ20706;;
BANK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BANK1 is a B-cell-specific scaffold protein and LYN (165120) tyrosine
kinase substrate that promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (see ITPR1; 147265) (Yokoyama et al.,
2002).

CLONING

By solid-phase phosphorylation screening, followed by database analysis
and PCR of RNA isolated from Daudi B cells, Yokoyama et al. (2002)
cloned BANK1, which they called BANK. The deduced 755-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 85.5 kD. BANK1 shares amino acid
homology with mouse Bcap (PIK3AP1; 607942) especially over the ankyrin
repeat motifs and predicted coiled-coil regions. BANK1 contains 23
tyrosine residues that may be phosphorylated including several potential
SH2 domain binding sites. By Northern blot analysis, a 3.2-kb transcript
was detected in mouse spleen and human Daudi B cell line, but not in T
cells or myeloid cells. By RT-PCR analysis of various B and T lineage
cells, Yokoyama et al. (2002) showed that BANK1 expression was confined
to functional B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-expressing B cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis and spectrophotometry, Yokoyama et al.
(2002) showed that BANK1 underwent receptor-dependent tyrosine
phosphorylation and that BANK1 activation enhanced BCR-induced calcium
mobilization from intracellular calcium stores. By coimmunoprecipitation
analysis of BANK1 and LYN mutants, Yokoyama et al. (2002) demonstrated
that BANK1 residues 367-653 were required for association with LYN and
tyrosine phosphorylation of BANK1. BANK1 amino acids 1-367 interacted
with ITPR2 (600144). By interaction and phosphorylation analyses of
coexpression of BANK1, LYN, and ITPR2 and various mutants, Yokoyama et
al. (2002) concluded that BANK1 promotes LYN-mediated tyrosine
phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors.

MAPPING

By database sequence analysis, Yokoyama et al. (2002) mapped the BANK1
gene to chromosome 4q22-q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) is a prototypic autoimmune
disease characterized by production of autoantibodies and complex
genetic inheritance. In a genomewide association scan of SLE using
85,042 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Kozyrev et al. (2008)
identified an association between SLE and a nonsynonymous substitution,
dbSNP rs10516487 (R61H; 610292.0001) in the BANK1 gene. They replicated
the association for independent case-control sets. In an analysis of
BANK1 cDNA, they found 2 isoforms, 1 full-length and the other
alternatively spliced and lacking exon 2, encoding a protein without a
putative domain for binding of IP3R (147265). The transcripts were
differentially expressed depending on a branch point-site SNP, dbSNP
rs17266594, in strong linkage disequilibrium with dbSNP rs10516487. A
third associated variant was found in the ankyrin domain (dbSNP
rs3733197). These findings implicated BANK1 as a susceptibility gene for
SLE, with variants affecting regulatory sites and key functional
domains. The disease-associated variants could contribute to sustained B
cell receptor signaling and B cell hyperactivity characteristic of SLE.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using flow cytometry, Aiba et al. (2006) showed that Bank was expressed
in most mouse B-cell subpopulations, but that Bank expression was
decreased in germinal center (GC) B cells. Aiba et al. (2006) generated
Bank-deficient mice and found that Bank was dispensable for most aspects
of B-cell development. However, Bank-deficient mice had higher levels of
mature B cells and spontaneous GC B cells, particularly in response to
T-dependent antigens, as well as higher serum IgG2a. Bank-deficient B
cells had an enhanced proliferative response to Cd40 (109535). Augmented
GC formation and IgM secretion in response to T-dependent antigen
immunization were abolished in mice lacking both Cd40 and Bank. Western
blot analysis revealed enhanced Cd40-mediated Akt (164730) activation in
Bank-deficient B cells. Aiba et al. (2006) concluded that BANK modulates
hyperactive B-cell responses by inhibiting AKT activation in
CD40-mediated pathways.

Kozyrev et al. (2008) identified an association between systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE; 152700) and a nonsynonymous substitution, dbSNP

that results in substitution of his for arg at codon 61, with the G

Chestkov et al. (1996) described DPF3, which they called Cer-d4, a
conserved gene homologous to Neuro-d4 (DPF1; 601670). The human protein
is the apparent homolog of the mouse Cer-d4 protein.

Ninkina et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding a truncated isoform of
mouse Dpf3, which they called Cerd4. The deduced protein contains 356
amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected multiple Cerd4 transcripts
in mouse retina, cerebellum, and testis only.

Lange et al. (2008) stated that there are 2 splice variants of DPF3.
They cloned the cDNA encoding the full-length isoform, DPF3B, from a
human heart cDNA library. The deduced 378-amino acid DPF3B protein
contains an N-terminal 2/3 domain, which includes a putative nuclear
localization signal, followed by a nuclear receptor interaction domain,
a C2H2 Kruppel-like zinc finger, and 2 C-terminal plant homeodomains
(PHDs). The deduced truncated isoform, DPF3A, contains 357 amino acids
and is identical to DPF3B through the first 290 amino acids, but it
contains only a single truncated PHD finger at its C terminus.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Zeng et al. (2010) reported the structural mechanism of acetylated
histone binding by the double PHD fingers of human DPF3B. Their
3-dimensional solution structure and biochemical analysis of DPF3B
highlighted the molecular basis of the integrated tandem PHD finger,
which acts as 1 functional unit in the sequence-specific recognition of
lys14-acetylated histone H3 (see 602810). Whereas the interaction with
H3 was promoted by acetylation at lys14, it was inhibited by methylation
at lys4, and these opposing influences were important during
transcriptional activation of the mouse Dpb3b target genes Pitx2
(601542) and Jmjd1c (604503). Zeng et al. (2010) concluded that binding
of this tandem protein module to chromatin can thus be regulated by
different histone modifications during the initiation of gene
transcription.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ninkina et al. (2001) determined that the DPF3 gene contains 12 exons
and spans over 275 kb.

MAPPING

Chestkov et al. (1996) mapped the DPF3 gene to chromosome 14q24.3-q31.1
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Ninkina et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Dpf3 gene to a region of
chromosome 12D3 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
14q24.3-q31.

606538	TITLE *606538 MYOSIN IC; MYO1C
;;MYOSIN 2, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; MYR2;;
NUCLEAR MYOSIN I; NMI
DESCRIPTION Myosins are molecular motors that, upon interaction with actin
filaments, utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate mechanical
force. For further background information on myosins, see MYO1A
(601478).

CLONING

By screening a kidney cDNA library with a mouse Myo1c probe, Crozet et
al. (1997) obtained a human cDNA encoding MYO1C. The deduced 1,028-amino
acid protein, which is 96% identical to the mouse protein, contains ATP-
and actin-binding sequences in the motor (or head) domain, followed by
three 23-residue IQ motifs and a tail domain rich in basic residues that
is expected to interact with negatively charged membrane phospholipids.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of Myo1c in adult
mouse tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

MYO1C, also known as myosin I-beta and MYR2, was thought to mediate the
slow component of adaptation by hair cells, the sensory cells of the
inner ear. To test this hypothesis, Holt et al. (2002) mutated tyr61 of
MYO1C to gly, conferring susceptibility to inhibition by N6-modified ADP
analogs. They expressed the mutant MYO1C in utricular hair cells of
transgenic mice, delivered an ADP analog through a whole-cell recording
pipette, and found that the analog rapidly blocked adaptation to
positive and negative deflections in transgenic cells but not in
wildtype cells. The speed and specificity of inhibition suggested that
MYO1C participates in adaptation in hair cells.

Bose et al. (2002) reported that the unconventional myosin MYO1C is
present in GLUT4 (138190)-containing vesicles purified from 3T3-L1
adipocytes. MYO1C is highly expressed in primary and cultured
adipocytes. Insulin (176730) enhances the localization of MYO1C with
GLUT4 in cortical tubulovesicular structures associated with actin
filaments, and this colocalization is insensitive to wortmannin.
Insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the adipocyte plasma
membrane is augmented by the expression of wildtype MYO1C and inhibited
by a dominant-negative cargo domain of MYO1C. A decrease in the
expression of endogenous MYO1C mediated by small interfering RNAs
inhibited insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. Thus, Bose et al.
(2002) concluded that MYO1C functions in a
phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase (PI3K; see 601232)-independent
insulin signaling pathway that controls the movement of intracellular
GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane.

MAPPING

Using PCR and radiation hybrid analysis, Crozet et al. (1997) mapped the
MYO1C gene to 17p13.

motor-dependent interchromosomal interactions involving MYO1C are

610223	TITLE *610223 RAS AND RAB INTERACTOR 3; RIN3
;;RAB5-INTERACTING PROTEIN 3;;
FLJ22439
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RIN3 is a member of the RIN family of Ras interaction-interference
proteins, which are binding partners to the RAB5 small GTPases (see
RAB5A; 179512) (Kajiho et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with GTPase-deficient mutant RAB5B
(179514) as bait, followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of a human
leukocyte cDNA library, Kajiho et al. (2003) cloned the RIN3 gene. The
deduced 985-amino acid protein shares features with RIN1 (605965) and
RIN2 (610222), including an SH2 domain, a Vps9 domain, and a conserved
centrally located 100-amino acid RIN homology domain. RIN3 contains 3
proline-rich domains (PRDs), while RIN1 and RIN2 have 1 and 2 PRDs,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb transcript in all
human tissues examined, with highest expression in peripheral blood
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kajiho et al. (2003) showed that RIN3 bound GTP preferentially over GDP
and acted as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor on RAB5B. By
immunostaining and confocal microscopy of RIN3 transiently expressed in
HeLa cells, they colocalized RIN3 and RAB5 to punctate vesicles in the
cytoplasm and found that vesicular localization of RIN3 required the
RIN3 C-terminal region, suggesting that RIN3 binding to RAB5 is needed
for vesicular localization. In HeLa cells expressing RIN3, transferrin
(TF; 190000) was transported partly through RIN3-positive vesicles to
early endosomes, suggesting that RIN3 plays a role in intracellular
transport from plasma membranes to early endosomes. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis and GST pull-down assays showed that RIN3 interacted through
its N-terminal PRDs with the SH3 domain of amphiphysin II (BIN1;
601248). Through confocal microscopy of HeLa cells coexpressing RIN3 and
amphiphysin II, Kajiho et al. (2003) found that cytoplasmic amphiphysin
II translocated into RIN3-positive vesicles and that this localization
was dependent on RIN3 interaction with the amphiphysin II SH3 domain.
Kajiho et al. (2003) suggested that RIN3, RAB5, and amphiphysin II form
a ternary complex that is involved in the early endocytic transport
pathway.

By assaying recombinant proteins in vitro and following expression in
transfected cells, Kajiho et al. (2011) found that RIN3 functioned as a
GEF for RAB31 (605694), in addition to RAB5, but not for RAB21 (612398).
Mutation analysis revealed that the VPS9 domain was responsible for RIN3
GEF activity. Cotransfection of RAB31 with RIN3 in HeLa cells resulted
in coexpression of RIN3 and RAB31 in enlarged vesicles and
tubulovesicular structures. Mutation of 8 serines to alanine in an
internal sequence of RIN3 between the SH2 and RIN family homology domain
decreased the interaction of RIN3 with RAB31, but not with RAB5. These
mutations also inhibited the GEF activity of RIN3 for RAB31.
Coexpression of RIN3 with CDMPR (M6PR; 154540) reduced the amount of
CDMPR with the trans-Golgi network and increased the amount of CDMPR
associated with perinuclear endosomes in a way that depended on the GEF
activity of RIN3 for RAB31. Kajiho et al. (2011) concluded that RIN3
acts as a GEF to regulate RAB31-dependent transport between the
trans-Golgi network and early endosomes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the RIN3 gene to chromosome 14q32.12 based on an
alignment of the RIN3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK026092) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;LECTIN, C-TYPE, SUPERFAMILY MEMBER 2; CLECSF2;;
ACTIVATION-INDUCED C-TYPE LECTIN; AICL;;
LECTIN, C-TYPE, ACTIVATION-INDUCED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CLEC2B is a myeloid-specific activating receptor that binds NKp80
(KLRF1; 605029) on natural killer (NK) cells, thereby initiating
cross-talk between myeloid cells and NK cells (Welte et al., 2006).

CLONING

The NK gene complex on chromosome 12p13-p12 encodes CD69 (107273) and
other type II transmembrane proteins with a C-type lectin domain. By
searching an EST database for sequences related to CD69, Hamann et al.
(1997) identified a partial AICL cDNA. They used the partial cDNA to
screen a phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-activated human peripheral
blood mononuclear cell cDNA library and isolated cDNAs corresponding to
the entire AICL coding sequence. The predicted 149-amino acid AICL
protein is a type II membrane protein, with a C-terminal extracellular
C-type lectin domain, a transmembrane region, and a very short
N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. AICL has a molecular mass of
approximately 17 kD. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that AICL
was expressed preferentially in lymphoid tissues and in most
hematopoietic cell types. Transcription of AICL was transiently
upregulated during lymphocyte activation by PMA, with kinetics similar
to those of CD69.

GENE FUNCTION

By generating monoclonal antibodies and using flow cytometric and RT-PCR
analyses, Welte et al. (2006) showed that NKp80 was expressed
predominantly on NK cells, but also on gamma-delta T cells, and that it
induced NK-cell degranulation and cytokine release. FACS and surface
plasmon resonance analyses showed that AICL, a myeloid cell-specific
receptor, interacted with NKp80 at an intermediate on rate and a rapid
off rate. AICL expression was upregulated by a number of Toll-like
receptor (TLR; see 603030) ligands, but not by TLR9 (605474) ligands.
Welte et al. (2006) concluded that AICL is a ligand for the activating
NK receptor NKp80 and that NKp80-AICL interaction induces cytolysis of
myeloid cells and activation of both NK cells and monocytes. They noted
that both molecules are present in humans but not in rodents.

MAPPING

By analysis of mapped YAC clones, Hamann et al. (1997) localized the
CLEC2B gene to the NK gene complex on chromosome 12p13-p12. They found
that the AICL gene lies 0.3 cM proximal to the CD69 gene.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences encoding RBCC (N-terminal RING
finger/B-box/coiled-coil) proteins, Short and Cox (2006) identified
TRIM67, which they called TNL. The deduced protein contains an
N-terminal RING finger domain, 2 B-boxes, a coiled-coil region, a COS
box, an FN3 domain, and a B30.2 domain. TRIM67 shares 65% amino acid
identity with TRIM9 (606555).

GENE STRUCTURE

Short and Cox (2006) determined that the TRIM67 gene contains 12 exons
and spans about 53 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Short and Cox (2006) mapped the TRIM67
gene to chromosome 1q42.

604188	TITLE *604188 SELENIUM-BINDING PROTEIN 1; SELENBP1
;;SELENIUM-BINDING PROTEIN, 56-KD; SP56
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Selenium is an essential nutrient that exhibits potent anticarcinogenic
properties, and deficiency of selenium may cause certain neurologic
diseases. It has been proposed that the effects of selenium in
preventing cancer and neurologic diseases may be mediated by
selenium-binding proteins. By sequencing randomly selected human fetal
heart cDNAs, followed by searching sequence databases for sequence
similarities, Chang et al. (1997) identified a cDNA that has sequence
similarity to the mouse 56-kD selenium-binding protein (Sp56) gene. The
deduced 472-amino acid human SP56 (SELENBP1) has 87.3% and 86.4% amino
acid identity to mouse Sp56 and the acetaminophen metabolite-binding
protein AP56, respectively. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected the highest Sp56 expression in liver, kidney, and lung (see
also Lanfear et al., 1993).

GENE FUNCTION

Okunuki et al. (2007) identified selenium-binding protein as a candidate
retinal autoantigen in patients with Behcet disease (109650). Because
anti-SELENBP1 antibody-positive patients showed more frequent ocular
inflammation than the antibody-negative patient group, Okunuki et al.
(2007) concluded that autoimmunity against this retinal antigen might
contribute to the pathogenesis of uveitis in BD patients.

MAPPING

By FISH, Chang et al. (1997) mapped the SELENBP1 gene to 1q21-q22.

611616	TITLE *611616 NAD KINASE; NADK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NADK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to NAD to
generate NADP, which in its reduced form acts as an electron donor for
biosynthetic reactions (Lerner et al., 2001).

CLONING

By EST database analysis using prokaryotic DNA kinase sequences as
probe, followed by PCR of a human fibroblast cDNA library, Lerner et al.
(2001) cloned NADK. The deduced 446-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 49.2 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.0-kb
transcript with high expression in placenta, moderate expression in
brain, colon, heart, liver, kidney, lung, spleen, stomach, and testis,
and low expression in small intestine. A band of 1.8 kb was detected in
several tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant NADK overexpressed in E. coli, Lerner et al. (2001)
showed that purified NADK catalyzed the synthesis of NADP from NAD and
ATP. By gel filtration analysis, they determined that catalytically
active human NADK was a homotetramer. NADK exhibited a specific activity
of 6.7 microM with a high specificity for NAD and ATP substrates. NADK
activity was resistant to heat treatment, had an optimum pH of 7-8, and
required divalent cations. NADK displayed a preference for zinc and
manganese ions over magnesium ions, while copper and nickel ions had no
effect on enzyme activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lerner et al. (2001) determined that the NADK gene contains 11 exons
spanning 14 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerner et al. (2001) mapped the NADK gene
to chromosome 1p36.33-p36.21.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Akasaka et al. (1990) isolated a GPX2 cDNA from a human liver cDNA
library. The deduced selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase contains
190 amino acids.

Chu et al. (1993) isolated GPX2 from a human HepG2 cDNA library and
identified a UGA codon for selenocysteine at nucleotide positions
152-154. Northern blot analysis detected a 1-kb GPX2 mRNA mainly in
gastrointestinal tissues in human and rodent and in human liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chu et al. (1996) demonstrated that the GPX2 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

Chu (1994) mapped the GPX2 gene to chromosome 14 by Southern analysis of
human/hamster somatic cell hybrids. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Chu et al. (1996) mapped the gene to 14q24.1.

Although GPX2 is a single gene in humans, there are 2 genes in the mouse
genome with homology to GPX2. Using a panel of mouse interspecies
backcross DNA, Chu et al. (1996) mapped one gene to mouse chromosome 12
in a region homologous to human 14q24.1 where human GPX2 maps; they
thought that most likely the chromosome 12 gene represents the
functional mouse Gpx2 gene. The other Gpx2-like gene mapped to mouse
chromosome 7. Its pseudogene nature was revealed by analysis of its
sequence which showed that it is intronless, has deletion of a single
nucleotide in the coding region, and has a poly(A) tail at its 3-prime
untranslated region.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, RT-PCR, and 3-prime RACE, Wagner et al. (2001)
cloned human and mouse PBX4. The deduced human and mouse proteins
contain 374 and 378 amino acids, respectively. RT-PCR and Northern blot
analyses of mouse tissues showed almost exclusive expression in testis.
Pbx4 was expressed in mouse prepubertal testis at around postnatal day
14, when the first spermatocytes had reached the pachytene stage of the
meiotic prophase. In situ hybridization of adult mouse testis detected
expression in all tubules in a ring of cells several layers thick in a
region corresponding to meiotic spermatocytes. Immunostaining detected
Pbx4 within the XY bodies of pachytene spermatocytes. RT-PCR detected
PBX4 expression in most human tumor cell lines examined.

By genomic sequence analysis, Wagner et al. (2001) mapped the PBX4 gene
to chromosome 19p12. Using FISH, they mapped the mouse Pbx4 gene to
chromosome 8C proximal, in a region that shows homology of synteny to
human chromosome 19p13-p12.

;;2-@HYDROXYPHYTANOYL-CoA LYASE;;
2-@HPCL;;
HPCL2
DESCRIPTION In the third step of the alpha-oxidation of 3-methyl-branched fatty
acids such as phytanic acid, a 2-hydroxy-3-methylacyl-CoA is cleaved
into formyl-CoA and a 2-methyl-branched fatty aldehyde. Foulon et al.
(1999) purified the cleavage enzyme from the matrix protein fraction of
rat liver peroxisomes and found that it is a protein composed of 4
identical 63-kD subunits. The enzyme's activity proved to depend on
Mg(2+) and thiamine pyrophosphate, a hitherto unrecognized cofactor of
alpha-oxidation. Formyl-CoA and 2-methylpentadecanal were identified as
reaction products when the purified enzyme was incubated with
2-hydroxy-3-methylhexadecanoyl-CoA as the substrate. Hence, the enzyme
catalyzes a carbon-carbon cleavage, and Foulon et al. (1999) designated
it 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase, or 2-HPCL. Sequences derived from
tryptic peptides of the purified rat protein were used as queries to
recover human ESTs. The composite cDNA sequence of the human lyase
contained an open reading frame encoding a predicted 578-amino acid
polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 63,732 Da. Recombinant
human protein expressed in mammalian cells exhibited lyase activity.
2-HPCL displays homology to a putative C. elegans protein that resembles
bacterial oxalyl-CoA decarboxylases. Similar to the decarboxylases, a
thiamine pyrophosphate-binding consensus domain is present in the
C-terminal part of 2-HPCL. Although neither peroxisome targeting
signal-1 nor -2 were apparent, transfection experiments with constructs
encoding green fluorescent protein fused to the full-length lyase or its
C-terminal pentapeptide indicated that the C terminus of 2-HPCL
represents a peroxisome targeting signal-1 variant.

607363	TITLE *607363 KINETOCHORE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; KNTC1
;;ROUGH DEAL, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; ROD;;
KIAA0166
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KNTC1 is a homolog of the Drosophila 'rough deal' (Rod) protein, a
component of the mitotic checkpoint surveillance mechanism. This complex
prevents the onset of anaphase by elaborating an inhibitory signal until
all chromosomes are properly attached and aligned on the spindle
(Scaerou et al., 2001).

CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones obtained from a human myeloid cell line,
Nagase et al. (1996) cloned KNTC1, which they called KIAA0166. The
deduced protein contains 2,209 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
revealed low-to-moderate expression in all tissues tested, with highest
expression in testis.

By Western blot analysis of HeLa cells, Chan et al. (2000) found that
KNTC1, which they called ROD, has a relative molecular mass close to the
calculated molecular mass of 250 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation of HeLa cells, Chan et al. (2000) and Scaerou
et al. (2001) determined that KNTC1 interacts with ZW10 (603954). Using
a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Scaerou et al. (2001) localized the
ZW10-binding region to the middle third of KNTC1. By immunofluorescence
localization, Chan et al. (2000) found KNTC1 throughout the cytoplasm of
cells at all mitotic stages. A fraction of the total pool was associated
with kinetochores and the spindle during mitosis. KNTC1 initially
concentrated at kinetochores during prometaphase. During metaphase,
staining moved to the spindle fibers and prominently to the spindle
poles. By late anaphase, KNTC1 was detected only at the spindle poles.
KNTC1 colocalized with ZW10 at kinetochores at prometaphase. Using
synchronized HeLa cells, Scaerou et al. (2001) found KNTC1 and ZW10
colocalized at kinetochores during prometaphase and metaphase, with the
brightest staining for both proteins on the spindle near the poles.
After late anaphase and telophase, ZW10 accumulated at the spindle
midzone, while KNTC1 staining became prominent at the spindle poles. By
injection of antibodies directed toward KNTC1 or ZW10 into HeLa cells
shortly after their release from the G1/S boundary, Chan et al. (2000)
found that anaphase cells contained lagging chromosomes and divided
cells contained chromatin bridges. They concluded that both KNTC1 and
ZW10 are essential components of the mitotic checkpoint.

MAPPING

By analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al. (1996)
mapped the KNTC1 gene to chromosome 17. However, Gross (2011) mapped the
KNTC1 gene to chromosome 12q24.31 based on an alignment of the KNTC1
sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC150278) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

134690	TITLE *134690 FAU GENE; FAU
;;FBR-MuSV ASSOCIATED UBIQUITOUSLY EXPRESSED GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The FAU gene is the cellular homolog of the fox sequence in the
Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine sarcoma virus (FBR-MuSV) (summary by Kas et
al., 1992).

CLONING

Kas et al. (1992) cloned and sequenced the human FAU gene. Its name is
derived from 'FBR-MuSV associated ubiquitously expressed gene.' FAU
encodes a fusion protein consisting of 133 amino acids. The 59 amino
acids at the carboxy terminus encode the ribosomal protein S30, part of
the small ribosomal subunit. The amino-terminal part of FAU (74 amino
acids) shows strong homology to ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid
multifunctional cellular protein.

MAPPING

Kas et al. (1993) used a cosmid clone containing the human FAU gene for
fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize the gene to 11q13. The
localization was confirmed by hybridization against a panel of somatic
cell hybrids containing different parts of chromosome 11 on a hamster
background. FAU was then further mapped, both on a panel of
radiation-reduced somatic cell hybrids designed to carry different parts
of the 11q13 region and by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. This fine
mapping placed FAU close to the PYGM gene (608455) in a region that
contains oncogenes as well as the putative tumor suppressor genes MEN1
(613733) and ST3 (191181).

By linkage mapping, Casteels et al. (1995) assigned the Fau gene to
mouse chromosome 19.

Courseaux et al. (1996) used a combination of methods to refine maps of
the approximately 5-Mb region of 11q13 that includes MEN1 (613733). They
proposed the following gene order:
cen--PGA--FTH1--UGB--AHNAK--ROM1--MDU1--CHRM1--COX8--EMK1--FKBP2--PLCB3--[PYGM,
ZFM1]--FAU--CAPN1--[MLK3, RELA]--FOSL1--SEA--CFL1--tel.

OTHER FEATURES

Kapranov et al. (2010) demonstrated that human cells contain a novel
type of short RNA (sRNA) with a nongenomically encoded 5-prime poly(U)
tail. They proposed that the presence of these RNAs at the termini of
genes, specifically at the very 3-prime ends of known mRNAs, such as
that for FAU, strongly argues for the presence of a yet uncharacterized
endogenous biochemical pathway in cells that can copy RNA. Kapranov et
al. (2010) showed that this pathway can operate on multiple genes, with
specific enrichment toward transcript-encoding components of the
translational machinery. They also showed that genes are also flanked by
sense, 3-prime polyadenylated sRNAs that are likely to be capped.

604266	TITLE *604266 MULTIPLE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE DOMAINS 6; MEGF6
;;EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE 3, FORMERLY; EGFL3, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The domain that characterizes epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)
consists of approximately 50 amino acids with 3 disulfide bonds.
EGF-like domains are believed to play a critical role in a number of
extracellular events, including cell adhesion and receptor-ligand
interactions. Proteins with EGF-like domains often consist of more than
1,000 amino acids, have multiple copies of the EGF-like domain, and
contain additional domains known to be involved in specific
protein-protein interactions. To identify proteins containing EGF-like
domains, Nakayama et al. (1998) searched a database of long cDNA
sequences randomly selected from a human brain cDNA library for those
that encode an EGF-like motif. They identified several partial cDNAs
encoding novel proteins with EGF-like domains, such as EGFL3, which they
named MEGF6. Nakayama et al. (1998) isolated a rat cDNA containing the
complete Megf6 coding sequence. The predicted Megf6 protein contains a
signal sequence and 30 EGF-like domains, 3 of which are a
calcium-binding type and 23 of which contain 2 additional cysteine
residues within the consensus EGF-like motif. The N-terminal portion of
Megf6 shows significant sequence similarity to fibrillin (134797).
Northern blot analysis detected Megf6 expression in rat lung.

MAPPING

Using a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nakayama et al. (1998) mapped
the EGFL3 gene to 1p36.3.

600031	TITLE *600031 CHITINASE 1; CHIT1
;;CHITINASE, MACROPHAGE; CHIT;;
CHITOTRIOSIDASE;;
METHYLUMBELLIFERYL-TETRA-N-ACETYLCHITOTETRAOSIDE HYDROLASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CHIT1 gene encodes plasma methylumbelliferyl
tetra-N-acetylchitotetraoside hydrolase (chitotriosidase), a human
chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14). Chitinases play a role in degrading the chitin
walls of some microorganisms (Boot et al., 1995).

CLONING

Renkema et al. (1995) purified and characterized the chitotriosidase
protein from the spleen of a patient with Gaucher disease (230800) who
had increased serum CHIT1 enzyme activity. Two major isoforms with
isoelectric points of 7.2 and 8.0 and molecular masses of 50 and 39 kD,
respectively, were found to have identical N-terminal amino acid
sequences. An antiserum raised against the purified 39-kD
chitotriosidase precipitated all isozymes. The findings suggested that a
single gene encodes the different isoforms of chitotriosidase. The
authors postulated that the enzyme may be involved in defense against
and in degradation of chitin-containing pathogens such as fungi,
nematodes, and insects.

Boot et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the chitotriosidase
gene from a macrophage cDNA library. The deduced 445-amino acid protein
has a molecular mass of 49 kD, similar to the larger isoform detected by
Renkema et al. (1995). Secretion of active chitotriosidase was obtained
after transient transfection of COS-1 cells with the cloned cDNA.
Chitotriosidase contains several regions with high homology to those
present in chitinases from different species belonging to family 18 of
glycosylhydrolases. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of
chitotriosidase mRNA occurred only at a late stage of differentiation of
monocytes to activated macrophages in cell culture. The authors
speculated that the enzyme may play a role in the degradation of
chitin-containing pathogens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Boot et al. (1998) determined that the CHIT1 gene contains 12 exons and
spans about 20 kb.

MAPPING

Eiberg and Den Tandt (1997) mapped the CHIT locus to chromosome
1q31-qter between flanking markers D1S191 and D1S245. By fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Boot et al. (1998) assigned the CHIT gene to
1q31-q32.

GENE FUNCTION

Hollak et al. (1994) observed a very marked increase (more than
600-fold) of chitotriosidase activity in the plasma of 30 of 32
symptomatic patients with type I Gaucher disease (230800), which is due
to mutation in the gene encoding beta-glucosidase (GBA; 606463). The
increase in plasma chitotriosidase that they observed in Gaucher disease
patients was far more pronounced than the increase in alkaline
phosphatase (ALPL; 171760), which had been used as an important
diagnostic hallmark of the disease. Chitotriosidase activity declined
dramatically during enzyme supplementation therapy. In contrast, 3
GBA-deficient individuals without clinical symptoms had only slight
increases in chitotriosidase. The authors considered it unlikely that
chitotriosidase itself contributes to the clinical presentation of
Gaucher disease. Hollak et al. (1994) noted that the similarity between
lysozyme (LYZ; 153450) and chitotriosidase with respect to catalytic
activity toward particular substrates suggested that the latter may also
function in host defense mechanisms, e.g., through cleavage of bacterial
cell wall polysaccharide. Hollak et al. (1994) suggested that the
macrophages loaded with glucosylceramide in Gaucher disease are the main
source of the plasma enzyme activity. No elevation, or only moderate
elevation, of plasma chitotriosidase was found in a variety of
granulomatous immunologic disorders.

Boot et al. (1995) noted that homologous chitinases in plants are known
to defend against fungal pathogens. The bactericidal function of
lysozyme is also well established; nevertheless, in rabbits an inherited
deficiency in lysozyme occurs that seems to have little consequence for
susceptibility to infections. The diverse array of defense mechanisms of
the immune system in mammals probably renders sufficient tolerance to
defects in single enzymes such as lysozyme and chitotriosidase.

By comparing the antifungal properties of human macrophage
chitotriosidase and its isolated domains, Vandevenne et al. (2011)
showed that the catalytic domain was sufficient for antifungal activity
and tended to be more efficient than the intact enzyme. In contrast, the
chitin-binding domain did not possess any antifungal properties.
Mutations in chitotriosidase that rendered the macrophage enzyme
inactive could be compensated by lysozyme, which had even greater
antifungal activity than chitotriosidase, as well as antibacterial
activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In individuals with chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Boot et al.
(1998) identified a homozygous 24-bp duplication in the CHIT1 gene
(600031.0001). The observed carrier frequency of about 35% indicated
that the duplication is the predominant cause of chitotriosidase
deficiency. The presence of the duplication in individuals from various
ethnic backgrounds suggested that this mutation is relatively old.

Grace et al. (2007) noted that the identification of CHIT1 gene
mutations that alter plasma activity is important for the use of this
biomarker to monitor disease activity and therapeutic response in
Gaucher disease. They genotyped the CHIT1 gene in 320 unrelated patients
with Gaucher disease, including 272 of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Among
all patients, 4% and 37.2% were homozygous and heterozygous,
respectively, for the 24-bp duplication. In addition, Grace et al.
(2007) identified 3 novel mutations in the CHIT1 gene
(600031.0002-600031.0004) in individuals with Gaucher disease and
chitotriosidase deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, 24-BP DUP

Boot et al. (1998) found that chitotriosidase deficiency (614122) can be
caused by a 24-bp duplication in exon 10 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in
activation of a cryptic 3-prime splice site, generating an mRNA with an
in-frame deletion of 87 nucleotides. All chitotriosidase-deficient
individuals tested were homozygous for the duplication. Among 171 Dutch
persons, 6.4% were homozygous and 35.1% were heterozygous for the
mutation. Among 68 Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, 5.9% were homozygous and
33.8% were heterozygous. The mutant chitotriosidase is predicted to lack
amino acids 344-372. On the basis of homology with several chitinases
for which the 3-dimensional structure has been resolved by
crystallographic analysis, the authors predicted that the internal
deletion in the mutant chitotriosidase prevents the formation of a
proper barrel conformation, with resulting loss of chitinolytic
activity.

Among a total of 320 unrelated patients with Gaucher disease (232800),
including 272 of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, Grace et al. (2007) found
that 4% and 37.2% were homozygous or heterozygous for the CHIT1 24-bp
dup, respectively. The allele frequency was 0.227.

.0002
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLY354ARG, LEU385LEU, AND 4-BP DEL

In a Caribbean Hispanic/African type 1 Gaucher disease (230800) patient
with chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified
a complex allele of the CHIT1 gene with 3 different variations in cis: a
1060G-A transition in exon 10 resulting in a gly354-to-arg (G354R)
substitution, a 1155G-A transition in exon 10 resulting in a synonymous
leu385-to-leu (L385L) substitution, and a 4-bp deletion in intron 10
(1156delGTAA). The complex allele was designated 'E/I-10'
(exon/intron-10) allele. The patient was compound heterozygous for the
E/I-10 complex allele and the common 24-bp duplication (600031.0001). In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the complex mutant had
no residual enzyme activity. Further screening identified the complex
allele in individuals of Caribbean Hispanic, Dominican, Caribbean Black,
Puerto Rican, and American Black descent. It was not identified in those
of Caucasian or Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLU74LYS

In a type I Gaucher disease (230800) patient with chitotriosidase
deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified a 220G-A transition
in exon 3 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in a glu74-to-lys (E74K)
substitution. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
E74K mutant had 51% activity compared to control values. The E74K allele
was found in 3 (1.4%) of 208 Ashkenazi Jewish alleles, but not in
non-Ashkenazi Jewish alleles, indicating that it is very rare. This
mutation was not found in normal controls.

.0004
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLY102SER

In 3 Ashkenazi Jewish type I Gaucher disease (230800) patients with
chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified a
304G-A transition in exon 4 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in a
gly102-to-ser (G102S) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies showed that the G102S mutant had 23% activity compared to
control values. The G102S allele had a frequency of 0.2 to 0.3 in
various control populations.

NOVEL ANTIGEN 2; NAG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSPAN4 belongs to the large family of tetraspanins, so named because
they contain 4 transmembrane domains. Tetraspanins are frequently
expressed at the cell surface in association with each other and with
other molecules, such as integrins (see ITGB1; 135630), and they
function to regulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
differentiation (summary by Todd et al., 1998).

CLONING

Tachibana et al. (1997) generated monoclonal antibodies against proteins
that coimmunoprecipitated with CD81 (TAPA1; 186845) from a human breast
cancer cell line. Two antibodies recognized a 28- to 35-kD protein,
which Tachibana et al. (1997) named NAG2 for 'novel antigen-2.' Using
the antibodies to screen a cDNA expression library derived from the
breast cancer cell line, the authors cloned cDNAs encoding NAG2. The
predicted 238-amino acid NAG2 protein contains 4 hydrophobic domains and
shows homology to transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) proteins. Northern
blot analysis detected a 1.5-kb NAG2 mRNA, and together with flow
cytometry and immunohistochemistry, showed that NAG2 was expressed in
multiple tissues but was absent in brain, lymphoid cells, and platelets.
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that NAG2 colocalized with CD81 on
the cell surface. Tachibana et al. (1997) identified mouse ESTs encoding
the mouse homolog of NAG2. The human and mouse NAG2 proteins have 95%
amino acid identity.

By searching an EST database for sequences containing a tetraspanin
consensus sequence, Todd et al. (1998) identified human TSPAN4. The
deduced 238-amino acid protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and
other features characteristic of tetraspanins, including conservation of
charged residues in or near the transmembrane domains, similar to ion
channels, and of 4 cysteines in the second extracellular domain.
Northern blot analysis detected highest TSPAN4 expression in heart and
placenta. EST database analysis suggested that TSPAN4 is also expressed
in brain, melanocytes, pancreas, and fetal liver/spleen, in addition to
pregnant uterus and adult and fetal heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Tachibana et al. (1997) found that NAG2 coimmunoprecipitated with
integrins and other TM4SF members, indicating that NAG2 is present in
TM4SF-TM4SF and TM4SF-integrin complexes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TSPAN4 gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the TSPAN4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF022813) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

604593	TITLE *604593 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 5C; KIF5C
;;KINESIN, HEAVY CHAIN, NEURON-SPECIFIC, 2; NKHC2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KIF5C gene encodes a member of the kinesin superfamily of proteins,
most of which are ATP-dependent molecular motors involved in
intracellular transport along microtubules. KIF5C functions as a
tetramer consisting of 2 heavy chains and 2 light chains (summary by
Poirier et al., 2013).

See KIF5B (602809) for general information on kinesins.

CLONING

By screening human brain cDNAs for the potential to encode proteins
larger than 100 kD, Nagase et al. (1998) isolated a full-length KIF5C
cDNA, which they called KIAA0531. The deduced 957-amino acid KIF5C
protein shares 75.4% amino acid sequence identity with KIF5A (602821)
across 953 amino acids. By SDS-PAGE, in vitro transcribed/translated
KIF5C had an apparent molecular mass greater than 100 kD. RT-PCR
detected KIF5C expression in several human tissues, with the highest
expression in brain, prostate, and testis, and moderate expression in
kidney, small intestine, and ovary.

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF5C belongs to the
kinesin-1 family.

GENE FUNCTION

Kinesins have N-terminal motor domains and C-terminal cargo-binding tail
domains separated by hinge regions. Kanai et al. (2004) found that the
hinge and C-terminal tail regions of Kif5a, Kif5b, and Kif5c bound a
large detergent-resistant RNase-sensitive granule from mouse brain. Mass
spectrometric analysis showed that the granule contained mRNAs for
Camk2-alpha (CAMK2A; 114078) and Arc (NOL3; 605235) and 42 proteins,
including those for RNA transport, protein synthesis, and translational
silencing. The granule localized to dendrites and underwent
bidirectional movement. Distally directed movement of the granule was
enhanced by Kif5 overexpression and reduced by Kif5 functional blockage.
Kanai et al. (2004) concluded that kinesins transport RNA in dendrites
via this large granule.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid mapping, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the KIF5C gene
to chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 brothers with complex cortical dysplasia with other brain
malformations-2 (CDCBM2; 615282), Poirier et al. (2013) identified a
heterozygous mutation in the KIF5C gene (E237V; 604593.0001). The
mutation was identified by whole-exome sequencing and was not found in
several genomic databases, including dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, Exome Variant
Server, and a local Paris Descartes Bioinformatics platform database.
The unaffected mother was determined to be germline mosaic for the
mutation. In vitro functional expression studies in E. coli and COS-7
cells showed that the mutant protein was expressed, but had a complete
loss of ATP hydrolysis activity. In COS-7 cells, mutant KIF5C heavily
colocalized with microtubules throughout the cell, but did not appear as
puncta or accumulate in cortical clusters as did the wildtype protein.
Poirier et al. (2013) postulated a dominant-negative effect. Three of
the affected fetuses died in utero; the 1 surviving son had microcephaly
(-4 SD), arthrogryposis, and early-onset epilepsy, and he was bedridden
with spastic tetraplegia at age 1 month. Brain MRI showed frontal and
perisylvian polymicrogyria and thin corpus callosum. The findings
extended the association between microtubule-based cellular processes
and proper cortical development.

KIF5C, GLU237VAL

In 4 brothers with complex cortical dysplasia with other brain
malformations-2 (CDCBM2; 615282), Poirier et al. (2013) identified a
heterozygous c.710A-T transversion in the KIF5C gene, resulting in a
glu237-to-val (E237V) substitution at a conserved residue in the
microtubule-interacting domain. The mutation was identified by
whole-exome sequencing and was not found in several genomic databases,
including dbSNP, 1,000 Genomes, Exome Variant Server, and a local Paris
Descartes Bioinformatics platform database. The unaffected mother was
determined to be germline mosaic for the mutation. Three-dimensional
modeling showed the surface location of this residue within the motor
domain. In vitro functional expression studies in E. coli and COS-7
cells showed that the mutant protein had a complete loss of ATP
hydrolysis activity. In COS-7 cells, mutant KIF5C heavily colocalized
with microtubules throughout the cell, but did not appear as puncta or
accumulate in cortical clusters as did the wildtype protein. Poirier et
al. (2013) postulated a dominant-negative effect. Three of the affected

173393	TITLE *173393 PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR RECEPTOR; PTAFR
;;PAFR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PTAFR shows structural characteristics of the rhodopsin (180380) gene
family and binds platelet-activating factor (PAF). PAF is a phospholipid
(1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) that has been
implicated as a mediator in diverse pathologic processes, such as
allergy, asthma, septic shock, arterial thrombosis, and inflammatory
processes.

CLONING

By PCR using primers based on the sequence of guinea pig PAF receptor to
amplify guinea pig genomic DNA, followed by screening of a human genomic
library, Seyfried et al. (1992) isolated the human PTAFR gene. They
determined that the PAF receptor appears to be a member of the G
protein-coupled family of receptors and exhibits significant similarity
to many members of this family.

Using either a conserved rhodopsin-type receptor sequence or the
sequence of guinea pig PAF receptor as probe to screen cDNA libraries of
hematopoietic origin, Ye et al. (1991), Nakamura et al. (1991), and Kunz
et al. (1992) cloned the cDNA for human PAF receptor. Human PTAFR shares
about 82% identity with the guinea pig PAF receptor. Kunz et al. (1992)
determined that the deduced 342-amino acid protein contains 7 putative
transmembrane domains interspersed with polar peptide segments,
characteristic of rhodopsin-type G protein-dependent receptors. PTAFR
has 2 N-glycosylation sites, but unlike other rhodopsin family members,
there is no N-glycosylation site in the N-terminal segment. Transfection
of PTAFR into COS-7 cells resulted in expression of the receptor with an
extracellular N terminus.

Nakamura et al. (1991) determined that the calculated molecular mass of
the PTAFR protein is about 39.2 kD. Northern blot analysis detected
abundant expression of an approximately 3.8-kb PTAFR transcript in
leukocytes, with less expression in undifferentiated eosinophilic or
erythroleukemia cell lines. Ye et al. (1991) detected a 4.0-kb PTAFR
transcript in placenta and lung, but not in heart, brain, liver,
skeletal muscle, kidney, or pancreas. Differentiated HL-60 granulocytes
also expressed PTAFR, but undifferentiated cells did not.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakamura et al. (1991) recorded an electrophysiologic response in
injected Xenopus oocytes following PTAFR expression, and observed that
transfected COS-7 cells showed ligand binding with pharmacologic
properties of the PAF receptor. Activation of the PAF receptor yielded
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production in both COS-7 cells and oocytes.
Injection of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog into oocytes inhibited
PAF-induced chloride ion currents, indicating that PAF stimulates
phosphoinositide turnover via G protein(s). The level of PTAFR mRNA
increased in an eosinophilic leukemia cell line treated with
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (138960), IL5 (147850),
and n-butyrate.

Ye et al. (1991) demonstrated that stably transfected mouse fibroblasts
expressing human PTAFR responded to subnanomolar PAF stimulation with
calcium mobilization, which could be inhibited by a PAF antagonist.
Calcium mobilization was PAF-dose-dependent and appeared to result from
an increase in the intracellular level of free calcium, since addition
of EGTA did not alter the calcium response.

Kunz et al. (1992) found that expression of PTAFR in a myeloid cell line
decreased following differentiation induced with dibutyryl-cAMP. They
demonstrated uptake of PAF by PTAFR-transfected COS-7 cells, and the
uptake was blocked by a PAF receptor antagonist.

Cundell et al. (1995) found that the mechanism of Streptococcus
pneumoniae attachment differed between activated and resting cells, and
that PTAFR is utilized to gain entry into activated cells. PAF and the
pneumococcal cell wall share phosphorylcholine as a determinant of
proinflammatory activity. Attachment of bacterial phosphorylcholine to
PTAFR enhanced adherence, which was coupled to invasion of endothelial,
epithelial, and PTAFR-transfected COS-7 cells. This progression was
arrested in vitro and in vivo by PTAFR-specific antagonists. PAF
interaction with PTAFR resulted in activation of phospholipase C (see
604114), but pneumococcal interaction with PTAFR did not. Cundell et al.
(1995) concluded that the binding of bacterial phosphorylcholine to
PTAFR in the absence of signal transduction subverts receptor
internalization to allow cell invasion.

By transduction of PTAFR into a PTAFR-negative epidermal cell line,
Marques et al. (2002) demonstrated that PTAFR activation stimulates ERK
(601795) and p38 (600289) MAP kinases, but not the JNK (601158) MAP
kinase. PTAFR activation also stimulated ERK-dependent cell
proliferation. ERK activation by PTAFR required the cleavage of
membrane-bound heparin-binding EGF (126150) by matrix metalloproteinases
(see 600754) and the subsequent activation of the EGF receptor (131550).
However, activation of p38 by PTAFR occurred through a distinct pathway.

Lukashova et al. (2001) found that PAF induced rapid tyrosine
phosphorylation of TYK2 (176941) in 2 human monocytic cell lines and in
COS-7 cells transfected with PTAFR and TYK2 cDNAs. TYK2
coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with PTAFR independent of ligand
binding. Deletion mutation analysis indicated that the N terminus of
TYK2 bound PTAFR. Activation of TYK2 was followed by a time-dependent 2-
to 4-fold increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1
(600555), STAT2 (600556), and STAT3 (102582), and a sustained 2.5-fold
increase in STAT5 (see 601511) tyrosine phosphorylation. STAT1 and STAT3
translocated to the nucleus following PAF stimulation, and their
translocation was dependent on TYK2 in transiently-transfected COS-7
cells. In the presence of TYK2, PAF induced activation of PTAFR
promoter-1 in a reporter assay. TYK2 activation and signaling by PAF was
independent of G proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Seyfried et al. (1992) determined that the PTAFR coding sequence
contains no introns.

Chase et al. (1993) found evidence for at least 1 intron in the 5-prime
untranslated region of the PTAFR gene.

MAPPING

By analysis of rodent/human somatic cell hybrids, Seyfried et al. (1992)
concluded that the PTAFR gene is located on human chromosome 1. Chase et
al. (1996) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize PTAFR to
1p35-p34.3. By Southern blot analysis, Kunz et al. (1992) determined
that GPR135 is a single-copy gene.

600927	TITLE *600927 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE INHIBITOR 2D; CDKN2D
;;p19(INK4D)
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclins are important in regulating the cell cycle through their
formation of enzymatic complexes with various cyclin-dependent kinases.
The D type cyclins complex with CDK4 (123829) and CDK6 (603368) to
govern progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle and later are
involved with inactivating phosphorylation of the RB1 protein (614041),
which results in release of RB1-associated transcription factors that
are needed for entry into S phase (Okuda et al., 1995). The activity of
the cyclin D-dependent kinases is, in part, controlled by inhibitors
such as the INK4 family, which includes INK4a (CDKN2A; 600160), 4b
(CDKN2B; 600431), 4c (CDKN2C; 603369), and 4d (CDKN2D). INK4a has been
shown to act by competing with CDK4 and CDK6 and functions as a tumor
suppressor in a variety of cancers.

CLONING

The INK4d protein was first identified in a yeast 2-hybrid system
screened for CDK4 binding proteins (Hirai et al., 1995).

Okuda et al. (1995) described the cloning of the human INK4d gene
(CDKN2D). The predicted 166-amino acid protein is 86% identical to the
mouse protein and about 45% identical to other human INK4 family
members. Northern blot analysis showed that the 1.4-kb transcript is
ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels in tissues with the most
rapidly dividing cells. Lowest expression occurred at mid-G1 phase and
was highest during S phase.

GENE FUNCTION

The mouse INK4d protein interacts with Cdk6. In fibroblasts and
macrophages it is rapidly induced at the G1-to-S transition.
Overexpression of INK4d caused NIH 3T3 cells to arrest in G1 phase and
inhibited cyclin D1-CDK4 kinase activity (Hirai et al., 1995).

GENE STRUCTURE

Matsuzaki et al. (2002) characterized the CDKN2D promoter region using
sequence analysis and truncated 5-prime flanking regions in luciferase
reporter assays. They identified several SP1 (189906) and AP2 (107580)
sites within an active promoter region and found that mutation of the
second SP1 site reduced promoter activity. There was no TATA box.

MAPPING

Okuda et al. (1995) obtained a P1-phage genomic clone including the gene
and mapped it by fluorescence in situ hybridization to 19p13.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zindy et al. (1999) generated mice with targeted deletions of both the
Ink4d and Kip1 genes. They found that terminally differentiated,
postmitotic neurons in these mice reentered the cell cycle, divided, and
underwent apoptosis. Zindy et al. (1999) noted that when either Ink4d or
Kip1 alone are deleted, the postmitotic state is maintained, suggesting
a redundant role for these genes in mature neurons.

Zindy et al. (2000) generated Ink4d-null mice by targeted gene
disruption. These animals developed into adulthood and had normal life
spans. Males exhibited marked testicular atrophy associated with
increased apoptosis of germ cells, although they remained fertile.
Ink4d-null mice did not spontaneously develop tumors, and they showed
normal sensitivity to ionizing radiation and carcinogens. Zindy et al.
(2000) concluded that Ink4d is not a tumor suppressor but is involved in
spermatogenesis.

Zindy et al. (2001) determined that both Ink4c and Ink4d were expressed
in the seminiferous tubules of postnatal wildtype mice, being largely
confined to postmitotic spermatocytes undergoing meiosis. Loss of either
Ink4c or Ink4d alone was associated with male fertility, but
double-knockout males were sterile. Spermatogonia did not differentiate
properly and became apoptotic. Residual spermatozoa had reduced motility
and decreased viability. Loss of Ink4c alone or in combination with loss
of Ink4d was associated with impaired differentiation of Leydig cells
and reduced testosterone levels, but there was no effect on the levels
of luteinizing hormone produced by the anterior pituitary. Loss of Ink4d
alone was associated with elevated levels of follicle-stimulating
hormone. Loss of Ink4c or Ink4d, either singly or in combination, had no
effect on female reproductive function.

In the organ of Corti, sensory hair cells and supporting cells become
postmitotic during embryogenesis and remain quiescent for the life of
the animal. When lost as a result of environmental insult or genetic
abnormality, hair cells do not regenerate, and this loss is a common
cause of deafness in humans. Chen et al. (2003) reported that targeted
deletion of Ink4d alone was sufficient to disrupt the maintenance of the
postmitotic state of sensory hair cells in postnatal mice. In Ink4d -/-
animals, hair cells aberrantly reentered the cell cycle and subsequently
underwent apoptosis, resulting in progressive hearing loss.

;;SH2 DOMAIN-CONTAINING LEUKOCYTE PROTEIN, 65-KD; SLP65;;
B CELL-SPECIFIC ADAPTOR PROTEIN; BASH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The BLNK gene encodes a B-cell linker protein. Linker or adaptor
proteins provide mechanisms by which receptors can amplify and regulate
downstream effector proteins. BLNK is essential for normal B-cell
development (Fu et al., 1998).

CLONING

Fu et al. (1998) identified a novel B-cell linker protein, which they
called BLNK. BLNK encodes a 456-amino acid polypeptide with basic,
acidic, proline-rich, and SH2 domains. An alternatively spliced product
called BLNK-S lacks basepairs 760 to 828 within the proline-rich domain.
The murine Blnk protein shares 82% identity with human BLNK. There
appeared to be no alternatively spliced form of mouse BLNK. BLNK shows
greatest homology to the SLP76 (601603) linker protein. BLNK mRNA is
predominantly expressed in the spleen, although some level of expression
can be seen in liver, kidney, and pancreas. Expression of BLNK proteins
was detected only in B-cell lines.

Wienands et al. (1998) independently cloned BLNK, which they called
SLP65.

GENE FUNCTION

Fu et al. (1998) showed that BLNK interfaces the B-cell receptor
(BCR)-associated SYK tyrosine kinase (600085) with PLC-gamma (172420),
the VAV guanine nucleotide exchange factor (164875), and the GRB2
(108355) and NCK (600508) adaptor proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of
BLNK by SYK provides docking sites for these SH2-containing effector
molecules that, in turn, permits the phosphorylation and/or activation
of their respective signaling pathways. Thus, BLNK represents a central
linker protein that bridges the B-cell receptor-associated kinases with
a multitude of signaling pathways and may regulate biologic outcomes of
B-cell function and development.

Ishiai et al. (1999) demonstrated that BLNK is essential in activating
phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma-2 (PLCG2; 600220) and JNK (601158). The
BCR-induced PLC-gamma-2 activation, but not the JNK activation, was
restored by introduction of a membrane-associated form of PLC-gamma-2
into BLNK-deficient B cells. As JNK activation requires both Rac1
(602048) and PLC-gamma-2, Ishiai et al. (1999) concluded that BLNK
regulates the Rac1-JNK pathway, in addition to modulating PLC-gamma-2
localization.

Jumaa et al. (2003) showed that the differentiation regulator SLP65
inhibits pre-B-cell leukemia in mice. Reconstitution of SLP65 expression
in an SLP65 -/- pre-B-cell line led to enhanced differentiation in vitro
and prevented the development of pre-B-cell leukemia in immune-deficient
mice. Tyrosine-96 of SLP65 was required for this activity. The murine
knockout SLP65 pre-B-cell leukemia resembles human childhood pre-B ALL.
Indeed, 16 of the 34 childhood pre-B ALL samples that were tested showed
a complete loss or drastic reduction of SLP65 expression. Jumaa et al.
(2003) suggested that this loss is probably due to the incorporation of
alternative exons into SLP65 transcripts, leading to premature stop
codons. Thus, Jumaa et al. (2003) concluded that the somatic loss of
SLP65 and the accompanying block in pre-B-cell differentiation might be
one of the primary causes of childhood pre-B ALL.

Taguchi et al. (2004) identified a pre-B ALL cell line lacking BLNK
expression in which stimulation of pre-BCR resulted in an absence of
phosphorylation of PLCG2 and an increase in intracellular calcium. In
contrast, activation of MAP kinase (see 602425) and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (see 601232) signaling was not affected. Taguchi et al. (2004)
concluded that BLNK is essential for PLCG2-induced calcium influx and
that BLNK-deficient cell lines may provide an in vitro model for
investigation of the role of BLNK in the pre-B-cell receptor-mediated
signaling mechanism.

Kohler et al. (2005) found that the leucine zipper in the highly
conserved N terminus of mouse Slp65 was essential for its association
with the plasma membrane. Mutation of critical leucines in the zipper
region abolished membrane association, as demonstrated by flow cytometry
and immunofluorescence microscopy.

Sprangers et al. (2006) identified defective SLP65 expression in 7 of 28
cases of pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia and 5 of 27 cases of B-cell
lymphoma. SLP65 deficiency correlated with RAG1 (179615)/RAG2 (179616)
expression and unremitting VH gene rearrangement activity.
Reconstitution of SLP65 expression in SLP65-deficient leukemia and
lymphoma cell lines resulted in RAG1/RAG2 downregulation and prevented
de novo VH-DJH rearrangements and secondary VH replacement. Sprangers et
al. (2006) concluded that iterative VH gene rearrangement represents a
frequent feature in B-lymphoid malignancy and can be attributed to SLP65
deficiency in many cases.

GENE STRUCTURE

The BLNK gene comprises 17 exons spread over about 65 kb of DNA
(Minegishi et al., 1999).

MAPPING

Minegishi et al. (1999) mapped the BLNK gene to chromosome 10q23.2 using
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a boy with agammaglobulinemia and absent B cells (AGM4; 613502),
Minegishi et al. (1999) identified a homozygous splice defect in the
BLNK gene (604515.0001). Although this patient had normal numbers of
pro-B cells, he had no pre-B cells or mature B cells, indicating that
BLNK plays a critical role in orchestrating the pro-B cell to pre-B cell
transition. The patient had developed recurrent otitis at 8 months of
age; after 2 episodes of pneumonia, he was evaluated for
immunodeficiency at 16 months of age. At that time, he had no detectable
serum IgG, IgM, or IgA, and he had less than 1% B cells in the
peripheral circulation. He was started on gammaglobulin replacement, and
between 2 and 20 years of age he did well except for chronic otitis and
sinusitis, hepatitis C acquired from intravenous gammaglobulin, and an
episode of protein-losing enteropathy in adolescence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pappu et al. (1999) generated mice deficient in Blnk by targeted
disruption. B-cell development in Blnk -/- mice was blocked at the
transition from B220+CD43+ progenitor B to B220+CD43- precursor B cells.
Only a small percentage of IgM M++, but not mature IgM(lo)IgD(hi), B
cells were detected in the periphery. Pappu et al. (1999) concluded that
BLNK is an essential component of the BCR signaling pathways and is
required to promote B-cell development.

Flemming et al. (2003) showed that both wildtype and Slp65 -/- bone
marrow-derived B cells required IL7 (146660) for proliferation. In the
absence of IL7, or by the reintroduction of Slp65, many mutant cells
expressed surface IgM and downregulated the pre-BCR. Cells lacking both
the pre-BCR and Slp65 had severely reduced proliferative capacity due to
a requirement for pre-B-cell receptor signaling leading to Erk (see
MAPK1; 176948) activation and Slp65 -/- cell survival. Flemming et al.
(2003) also found that Slp65-deficient mice were significantly more
likely to develop pre-B-cell lymphoma and solid tumors than were
wildtype mice. The authors concluded that SLP65 acts as an efficient
tumor suppressor by accelerating the progression of cells through a
mutation-prone developmental stage.

Hayashi et al. (2004) showed that anti-DNA Ig knockin mice had impaired
BCR editing at multiple levels in the absence of Bash. Mice lacking Bash
also had excessive antibody responses to DNA carrier immunization.
Hayashi et al. (2004) concluded that BCR-signaled receptor editing
contributes to establishing B-cell tolerance.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA 4, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE (1 family)
BLNK, IVS1DS, A-T, +3

In a 20-year-old male with early-onset hypoglobulinemia and absent B
cells (613502), Minegishi et al. (1999) identified a homozygous
alteration of the first exon of the BLNK gene and its flanking intronic
sequence. Two noncontiguous basepair substitutions were identified. The
first was a C-to-A substitution of the third basepair position in codon
10, which encoded a silent proline substitution. The second alteration
was an A-to-T transversion at the +3 position of the splice donor site
for intron 1, 20 basepairs downstream from the alteration in codon 10.
SSCP analysis of DNA from 100 unrelated individuals did not reveal the
same pattern as that of the patient. Minegishi et al. (1999) derived
cDNA directly from this patient's bone marrow and used RT-PCR analysis
to examine the abundance of BLNK transcripts. No BLNK transcripts could
be amplified from the patient's bone marrow. The patient's mother and
father, who were heterozygous for both basepair substitutions in BLNK,
were healthy and had normal concentrations of serum immunoglobulins and
normal numbers of B cells. An older brother developed recurrent otitis
at 6 months of age and died at 16 months of age of pseudomonas sepsis
and neutropenia.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

HIF is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in mammalian
oxygen homeostasis. Posttranslational modification by prolyl
hydroxylation is a key regulatory event that targets HIF (see HIF1A,
603348) subunits for proteasomal destruction via the von Hippel-Lindau
(VHL; 608537) ubiquitylation complex. Epstein et al. (2001) defined a
conserved HIF-VHL-prolyl hydroxylase pathway in C. elegans and
identified Egl9 as a dioxygenase that regulates HIF by prolyl
hydroxylation. In mammalian cells, they showed that the HIF-prolyl
hydroxylases are represented by 3 proteins with a conserved
2-histidine-1-carboxylate iron coordination motif at the catalytic site.
The genes encoding these proteins were cloned and termed PHD1 (606424),
PHD2, and PHD3 (606426) by the authors. Direct modulation of recombinant
enzyme activity by graded hypoxia, iron chelation, and cobaltous ions
mirrored the characteristics of HIF induction in vivo, fulfilling
requirements for these enzymes being oxygen sensors that regulate HIF.

By restriction enzyme screening of a YAC clone spanning the 1q42.1
translocation breakpoint associated with major psychosis for CpG
island-rich sequences, Dupuy et al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding
EGLN1, which they termed C1ORF12. The predicted 426-amino acid EGLN1
protein is 87% identical to the rat SM20 protein and contains 2 nuclear
localization signals.

Bruick and McKnight (2001) independently identified the conserved family
of HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, which they called HPH1, 2, and 3,
respectively, that appear to be responsible for the posttranslational
modification of HIF that targets it for ubiquitination.

By quantitative RT-PCR of 17 human tissues, Oehme et al. (2002) found
that EGLN1 expression was high in adipose tissue, moderate in heart, and
low in brain, small intestine, kidney, thymus, testis, adrenal gland,
pancreas, and uterus. No expression was detected in other tissues.

Independently, Hirsila et al. (2003) cloned HIFP4H1, HIFP4H2, and
HIFP4H3 by PCR of human colon, aorta, and lung cDNA. They identified
HIFP4H2 splice variants lacking exons 3 or 4. Skipping of exon 3 was
expected to result in an inactive protein due to the loss of key
catalytic residues. Skipping of exon 4 changes the C-terminal tail, but
it does not alter the catalytic site. PCR analysis revealed HIFP4H2
expression in all tissues examined, with highest expression in adult
heart, brain, lung, and liver and in fetal brain, heart, spleen, and
skeletal muscle. The splice variants showed weaker expression that
full-length HIFP4H2 in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

In cultured mammalian cells, Bruick and McKnight (2001) found that the
inappropriate accumulation of HIF caused by forced expression of the
HIF1A subunit under normoxic conditions was attenuated by coexpression
of HPH. Suppression of HPH in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells by
RNA interference resulted in elevated expression of the
hypoxia-inducible gene LDH (see 150000) under normoxic conditions.
Bruick and McKnight (2001) concluded that HPH is an essential component
of the pathway through which cells sense oxygen.

Using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells, Hirsila et al.
(2003) found that HIFP4H1, HIFP4H2, and HIFP4H3 showed in vitro
2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylation of a 19-residue peptide
corresponding to the C-terminal prolyl hydroxylation site of HIF1-alpha.
The protein encoded by the HIFP4H2 variant lacking exon 4 was inactive
in this assay. All 3 full-length enzymes showed lower or no activity
against a peptide corresponding to a more N-terminal putative prolyl
hydroxylation site in HIF1-alpha. All 3 enzymes hydroxylated peptides
designed from putative prolyl hydroxylation sites of human HIF2-alpha
(EPAS1; 603349), HIF3-alpha (HIF3A; 609976), and C. elegans HIF-alpha.
The isoform encoded by the short HIFP4H3 splice variant was inactive.

Ozer et al. (2005) found that ING4 (608524) suppressed expression of HIF
target genes under hypoxic conditions. ING4 directly interacted with
HPH2, a mediator of HIF stability, providing a mechanism for ING4
recruitment to HIF. ING4 association with HPH2 did not affect
hydroxylase activity or HIF stability, but it suppressed HIF activity in
a chromatin-dependent manner. Ozer et al. (2005) hypothesized that ING4,
recruited to HIF by HPH2 under hypoxic conditions, acts as an adaptor
protein to recruit transcriptional repressors to mediate HIF activity.

Minamishima and Kaelin (2010) showed that loss of all 3 PHDs (PHD1,
606424; PHD2; and PHD3, 606426) in the liver dramatically increased EPO
(133170) and hematocrit values to concentrations vastly in excess of
those achieved after renal PHD2 inactivation. Minamishima and Kaelin
(2010) found that PHD2 inactivation is sufficient to induce near maximal
renal EPO production, whereas inactivation of all 3 PHDs is needed to
reactivate hepatic EPO production.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hirsila et al. (2003) determined that the EGLN1 gene contains 4 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Using YAC and genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Dupuy et al. (2000)
mapped the EGLN1 gene to chromosome 1q42-q43, centromeric to the
breakpoint associated with major psychosis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a father, son, and daughter with familial erythrocytosis-3 (ECYT3;
609820), Percy et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous mutation in the
EGLN1 gene (606425.0001). The mutant protein showed dramatically
decreased hydroxylase activity towards both HIF1-alpha and HIF2-alpha
(603349). The findings provided evidence that EGLN1 plays a critical
role in regulating HIF levels in EPO-producing cells in humans.

Percy et al. (2007) identified a second heterozygous mutation in the
EGLN1 gene (606425.0002) in a patient with modest erythrocytosis and
inappropriately normal EPO levels.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mazzone et al. (2009) found that Phd2 -/- mice died at midgestation,
while Phd2 +/- mice were healthy and displayed normal angiogenesis.
Vessels formed in tumors often appear abnormal and function
inefficiently. Tumors with abnormal angiogenesis developed in wildtype
mice injected with several types of cancer cell lines; however, tumors
grown in Phd2 +/- mice appeared normal and showed improved oxygenation.
Phd2 haploinsufficiency also limited tumor metastasis.

Takeda et al. (2011) found that haplodeficient Phd2 mice displayed
preformed collateral arteries that preserved limb perfusion and
prevented tissue necrosis in ischemia. Improved arteriogenesis in Phd2
heterozygous mice was due to an expansion of tissue-resident, M2-like
macrophages and their increased release of arteriogenic factors, leading
to enhanced smooth muscle cell recruitment and growth. Both chronic and
acute deletion of one Phd2 allele in macrophages was sufficient to skew
their polarization towards a proarteriogenic phenotype. Mechanistically,
collateral vessel preconditioning relied on the activation of the
canonical NF-kappa-B (see 164011) pathway in Phd2 heterozygous
macrophages.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ERYTHROCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL, 3
EGLN1, PRO317ARG

In a father, son, and daughter with familial erythrocytosis-3 (609820),
Percy et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous 950C-G transversion in the
EGLN1 gene, resulting in a pro317-to-arg (P317R) substitution in a
highly conserved region of the protein. In vitro functional expression
studies showed that the mutant protein had markedly decreased enzyme
activity. The mutation was not identified in 200 control samples.
Erythropoietin (133170) levels in the son and daughter were
inappropriately normal, suggesting dysregulation of the EPO axis.

.0002
ERYTHROCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL, 3
EGLN1, ARG371HIS

In a patient with erythrocytosis-3 (609820), Percy et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous 1112G-A transition in the EGLN1 gene,
resulting in an arg371-to-his (R371H) substitution, 3 residues away from
an iron-chelating residue. In vitro functional expression studies showed
that the mutant protein had decreased binding to HIF2A (603349) and
HIF1A (603348), and showed decreased prolyl hydroxylase activity
compared to wildtype EGLN1. The patient had modest erythrocytosis with
inappropriately normal EPO levels.

.0003
ERYTHROCYTOSIS, FAMILIAL, 3
EGLN1, HIS374ARG

In a man with erythrocytosis-3 (609820), Ladroue et al. (2008)
identified a heterozygous 1121A-G transition in the EGLN1 gene,
resulting in a his374-to-arg (H374R) substitution in a highly conserved
residue that is important for binding of Fe(2+). In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the H374R mutant protein was unable to
suppress HIF-alpha subunits (see, e.g., HIF1A; 603348), indicating
impaired activity. The patient also had a recurrent paraaortic
paraganglioma associated with hypertension. Examination of tumor tissue
showed the H374R mutation and loss-of-heterozygosity for the wildtype
EGLN1 allele. The findings suggested that EGLN1 may also act as a
tumor-suppressor gene. Ladroue et al. (2008) noted that hereditary
paraganglioma syndromes (see, e.g., PGL1; 168000) can be caused by
mutations in genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase (see, e.g., SDHD;
602690), which result in accumulation of succinate and inhibition of PHD
function with overexpression of HIF. The authors suggested that
alteration of the ELGN1/HIF pathway could contribute to the growth of a
paraganglioma.

155541	TITLE *155541 MELANOCORTIN 4 RECEPTOR; MC4R
;;MCR RECEPTOR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Gantz et al. (1993) cloned a fourth member of the melanocortin receptor
family of 7-transmembrane G-protein linked receptors. By Northern blot
analysis and in situ hybridization, the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R)
was found to be expressed primarily in the brain; its expression was
notably absent in the adrenal cortex, melanocytes, and placenta. The
profile of responses of MC4R, transfected into COS-1 cells and L cells,
to different melanocortins distinguished it from the previously
described melanocortin receptors. (See 155555, 202200, and 155540.) MC4R
is a 333-amino acid protein encoded by a single exon (Yeo et al., 1998).

GENE FUNCTION

Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) inhibits the accumulation of nonsense- or
frameshift-mutated mRNA and thus minimizes the synthesis of truncated
proteins with potential dominant-negative effects. Brocke et al. (2002)
investigated the NMD sensitivity of nonsense-mutated transcripts of
MC4R. Nonsense-mutated variants of MC4R transcripts were stable and
expressed truncated proteins that were detectable in the lysates of
transfected cells. The authors hypothesized that the lack of necessity
for splicing in the naturally intronless MC4R gene may allow it to
escape from NMD.

By using a combination of pharmacologic, molecular genetic,
electrophysiologic, and feeding studies, Mineur et al. (2011) found that
activation of hypothalamic alpha-3 (118503)-beta-4 (118509) nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors leads to activation of proopiomelanocortin
(POMC; 176830) neurons. POMC neurons and subsequent activation of
melanocortin-4 receptors were critical for nicotinic-induced decreases
in food intake in mice. The study of Mineur et al. (2011) demonstrated
that nicotine decreases food intake and body weight by influencing the
hypothalamic melanocortin system and identified critical molecular and
synaptic mechanisms involved in nicotine-induced decreases in appetite.

Lim et al. (2012) showed that chronic stress in mice decreases the
strength of excitatory synapses on D1 dopamine receptor (DRD1;
126449)-expressing nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons owing to
activation of the melanocortin-4 receptor. Stress-elicited increases in
behavioral measurements of anhedonia, but not increases in measurements
of behavioral despair, are prevented by blocking these melanocortin-4
receptor-mediated synaptic changes in vivo. Lim et al. (2012) concluded
that stress-elicited anhedonia requires a neuropeptide-triggered, cell
type-specific synaptic adaptation in the nucleus accumbens and that
distinct circuit adaptations mediate other major symptoms of
stress-elicited depression.

MAPPING

By means of fluorescence chromosomal in situ hybridization, Gantz et al.
(1993) localized the MC4R gene to 18q21.3. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH), Magenis et al. (1994) mapped the MC4R gene to
18q22. Using FISH and radiation hybrid mapping, Sundaramurthy et al.
(1998) localized the MC4R gene to 18q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Yeo et al. (1998) and Vaisse et al. (1998) described a severely obese
child and adult, respectively, with a mutation in the MC4R gene. The
mutation was present in heterozygous state in each case, and other
members of the family were obese in a pattern consistent with autosomal
dominant inheritance. Molecular abnormalities have been identified in
autosomal recessive severe obesity involving the leptin gene
(164160.0001), the leptin receptor gene (601007.0002), the prohormone
convertase-1 gene (PC1; 162150.0001), and the proopiomelanocortin gene
(POMC; 176830.0001). Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is found in
association with mutations in the leptin, leptin receptor, and PC1
genes, and hypoadrenalism is found with POMC and PC1 gene mutations;
short stature is associated with mutations in the leptin receptor gene.
There was no evidence of impaired adrenal function in the MC4R-deficient
subjects; sexual development and fertility were normal, and affected
subjects were tall, which was of interest given the increased linear
growth exhibited by heterozygous Mc4r-deficient mice.

By SSCP, Hinney et al. (1999) screened the coding region of the MC4R
gene in 306 extremely obese children and adolescents, 25 healthy
underweight students, 52 normal weight individuals, 51 inpatients with
anorexia nervosa (606788), and 27 patients with bulimia nervosa
(607499). Several mutations were identified, including a 4-bp deletion
(155541.0001) that resulted in a frameshift, yielding a truncated
protein. This mutation had been assumed to be associated with dominantly
inherited morbid obesity in humans. Both the index patient (body mass
index (BMI), 42.06 kg/m2; height, 171 cm; age, 19.6 years) and her
mother (BMI, 37.55 kg/m2; height, 164 cm; age, 42.5 years) were
heterozygous for this deletion. A tyr35-to-ter substitution
(155541.0003) was detected in 2 obese probands (BMI, 31.29 kg/m2 and
45.91 kg/m2, respectively); this mutation led to a truncated protein
that encompassed the N-terminal extracellular domain. Both carriers also
showed an asp37-to-val mutation (155541.0004). In both cases these
mutations were maternally transmitted, indicating they form a haplotype.
A male obese proband harbored 2 missense mutations, and 4 different
missense mutations were detected in 4 different male probands. All
mutations in the MC4R gene were only found in extremely obese
individuals whose BMIs were all greater than the 99th percentile. An
ile251-to-leu (I251L) polymorphism was found in similar frequencies in
all groups studied. The authors concluded that MC4R mutations are not
uncommon. While the data supported dominantly inherited obesity because
of the 3 obese probands with haploinsufficiency, the functional
significance of the missense mutations remained to be determined.

In a study of 306 index patients, Hinney et al. (1999) detected 3 obese
probands with haploinsufficiency mutations in the MC4R gene. Sina et al.
(1999) extended the mutation screen to another 186 extremely obese
children and adolescents and identified an additional haploinsufficiency
carrier, bringing the total number of mutation-carrying obese patients
identified to 4. They genotyped and phenotyped 43 family members of
these 4 index patients. A total of 19 mutation carriers were identified.
Extreme obesity was the predominating phenotype; however, moderate
obesity occurred in 3 of the carriers. No other specific phenotypic
abnormalities were detected. Female haploinsufficiency carriers were
heavier than male carriers in the respective families, a finding similar
to findings in Mc4r-knockout mice.

Farooqi et al. (2003) stated that MC4R deficiency is the most common
form of monogenic obesity. To define the clinical spectrum, mode of
inheritance, genotype-phenotype correlations, and pathophysiologic
mechanisms leading to obesity, they determined the nucleotide sequence
of the MC4R gene in 500 probands with severe childhood obesity. In 29
probands (5.8%), they found mutations in MC4R (155541.0010-155541.0019);
23 were heterozygotes and 6 were homozygotes. Mutation carriers had
severe obesity, increased lean mass, increased linear growth,
hyperphagia, and severe hyperinsulinemia; homozygotes were more severely
affected than heterozygotes. Subjects with mutations retaining residual
signaling capacity had a less severe phenotype. Thus, MC4R mutations are
inherited in a codominant manner. The correlation between the signaling
properties of these mutant receptors and energy intake emphasized the
key role of this receptor in the control of eating behavior.

Dubern et al. (2001) identified 4 dominantly inherited heterozygous
missense MC4R mutations in 4 of 63 unrelated children with severe
obesity. The same mutation was not found in any of the control subjects.
Expression of the obese phenotype was variable in mutation-positive
family members. Dubern et al. (2001) concluded that MC4R mutations may
be a nonnegligible cause of severe obesity in children with variable
expression and penetrance.

Jacobson et al. (2002) determined the prevalence of mutations in the
coding and flanking regions of the MC4R gene in severely obese and
normal-weight subjects from the Swedish Obese Subjects study, the
Health, Risk Factors, Exercise Training, and Genetics (HERITAGE) Family
study, and a Memphis cohort. A total of 433 white and 95 black subjects
(94% females) were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. Three
previously described missense variants and 9 novel (3 missense, 6
silent) variants were detected. None of them showed significant
association with obesity or related phenotypes. In addition, 2 novel
deletions were found in 2 heterozygous obese women which were predicted
to encode a truncated nonfunctional receptor. No pathogenic mutations
were found among obese blacks or nonobese controls. Furthermore, none of
the null mutations found in other populations was present in this
sample. The authors concluded that their results do not support the
prevailing notion that sequence variation in the MC4R gene is a frequent
cause of human obesity.

In a cohort of 172 patients presenting with severe childhood obesity and
a family history of obesity, Lubrano-Berthelier et al. (2003) screened
for mutations in the coding region of the MC4R gene and identified 3
heterozygous MC4R mutations in 3 patients. A functional analysis of 14
MC4R mutations, including the 3 identified in this study, indicated that
all mutations altered the activation of the receptor by the endogenous
agonist alpha-MSH (see 176830). Lubrano-Berthelier et al. (2003) further
demonstrated that greater than 80% of childhood obesity-associated
heterozygous MC4R mutations led to intracellular retention of the
receptor.

Branson et al. (2003) sequenced the complete MC4R coding region and the
leptin-binding domain of the leptin receptor (LEPR; 601007) in 469
severely obese white subjects (370 women and 99 men). Normal-weight
controls were 15 women and 10 men without a history of dieting or a
family history of obesity. MC4R mutations, including 5 novel variants,
were found in 24 obese subjects (5.1%) and 1 control (4%). Twenty of the
24 obese subjects with an MC4R mutation were matched for age, sex, and
BMI with 120 of the 445 obese subjects without an MC4R mutation. All
mutation carriers reported binge eating, as compared with 14.2% of obese
subjects without mutations and none of the normal-weight subjects
without mutations. The prevalence of binge eating was similar among
carriers of mutations in the leptin-binding domain of LEPR and
noncarriers. No mutations were found in the region of POMC encoding
alpha-MSH, the ligand of MC4R. List and Habener (2003) commented on the
possible importance of ethnic background in the frequency of mutations
in MC4R in obesity. They also suggested that the findings of Branson et
al. (2003) be interpreted with caution, as they differed from earlier
findings of a binge-eating disorder prevalence of 5% among carriers of
MC4R mutations (Sina et al., 1999).

Hebebrand et al. (2004) compared the eating behavior of 43 obese
probands with functionally relevant MC4R mutations to wildtype controls.
No significant differences in binge-eating episodes between carriers of
the MC4R variants and wildtype controls were detected, and Hebebrand et
al. (2004) concluded that binge-eating episodes are not a distinct
feature of MC4R mutation carriers. This analysis was different from the
study of Branson et al. (2003) because Hebebrand et al. (2004) studied
only carriers of mutations that had been shown to be of functional
relevance in vitro and did not include carriers of silent variants in
the open reading frame, variants in untranslated regions (UTRs), or the
val103-to-ile (V103I) or I251L polymorphisms.

In detailed pharmacologic studies of 11 different missense mutations in
the MC4R gene associated with obesity, Nijenhuis et al. (2003) found
that all the mutant receptors were poorly expressed at the cell surface
and showed a decreased maximal response to agonist, indicating that the
mutations impair receptor function. The findings supported the
hypothesis that loss of function of MC4R contributes to obesity.

Santini et al. (2004) screened a population of Italian obese subjects
for MC4R variants, demonstrating a 1.7% prevalence of potentially
pathogenic mutations. They reported a novel heterozygous missense
mutation that impaired MC4R functional activity in vitro.

By means of transient transfection in vitro, Yeo et al. (2003) examined
the functional properties of 12 different mutations in human MC4R that
result in severe, familial, early-onset obesity. Of the 9 missense
mutants studied, 4 (including 155541.0013, 155541.0014, and 155541.0018)
were completely unable to generate cAMP in response to ligand and 5 were
partially impaired. Four (including 155541.0014 and 155541.0017) showed
impaired cell surface expression and 6 showed reduced ligand binding.
The mutant protein I316S (155541.0016) showed reduced affinity for
alpha-MSH but retained normal affinity for the antagonist agouti-related
protein (AGRP; 602311). None of the mutations inhibited signaling
through cotransfected wildtype receptors.

Valli-Jaakola et al. (2004) screened 2 Finnish cohorts, comprising 56
children with severe early-onset obesity (relative weight for height
greater than or equal to 70% before age 10) and 252 morbidly obese
adults (body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2) for MC4R mutations. They
identified a pathogenic mutation (S127L; 155541.0021) in 1 child,
causing severe early-onset obesity. They also identified a novel
polymorphism in the coding region and 2 novel variations outside the
coding region.

Hinney et al. (2003) performed a mutation screen of the coding region of
the MC4R gene in 808 extremely obese children and adolescents and 327
underweight or normal-weight controls. A total of 16 different missense,
nonsense, and frameshift mutations were found in the obese study group;
5 of these were novel. In vitro assays revealed that 9 of the 16
mutations led to impaired cAMP responses, compared with wildtype
receptor constructs. The association test based on functionally relevant
mutations was positive (P = 0.006, Fisher's exact test, one-sided). They
also screened a total of 1,040 parents of 520 of the aforementioned
obese young index patients to perform transmission disequilibrium tests.
The 11 parental carriers of functionally relevant mutations transmitted
the mutation in 81.8% (P = 0.033). The authors concluded that their
results supported the hypothesis that these MC4R mutations represent
major gene effects for obesity.

Lubrano-Berthelier et al. (2006) determined the prevalence of MC4R
mutations in a cohort of severely obese adults and the clinical
phenotype and the phenotype-genotype relationships of adult MC4R
mutation carriers. The prevalence of obesity specific MC4R mutations was
2.6%, (95% CI = 1.5-3.7). The prevalence of MC4R mutations was similar
in patients developing obesity in childhood (2.83%) and in patients with
a later onset of the disease (2.35%). Adult obese MC4R mutation carriers
did not present with binge eating or with any specific clinical
phenotype. The authors concluded that the severity of the functional
alterations of the mutated MC4Rs and, in particular, the intracellular
retention of the receptor correlated both with the severity and the
onset of the obesity in the mutation carriers.

Hinney et al. (2006) investigated the prevalence and spectrum of MC4R
mutations in 4,068 individuals of a German population-based study group
(KORA-S4) and 1,003 German obese adults (BMI greater than 30 kg/m2).
Sixteen (6 novel) coding nonsynonymous mutations were detected in 27
heterozygous individuals of KORA-S4. Four of the mutation alleles led to
impaired receptor function in vitro; however, none of these 6
heterozygous mutation carriers was obese. In the obese adults, 6 coding
nonsynonymous and a nonsense mutation were detected in 13 individuals.
Only the nonsense mutation allele entailed impaired receptor function.
The authors concluded that individuals heterozygous for nonsynonymous
MC4R mutation alleles entailing impaired function were not obese and
that nonsynonymous MC4R mutations causing impaired receptor function
were rare in German obese adults (2 in 1,003 = 0.2%).

By direct sequencing of the coding region of the MC4R gene in a cohort
of 289 Czech children and adolescents with early-onset obesity,
Hainerova et al. (2007) found a prevalence of 2.4% of MC4R homozygous
and heterozygous mutations. One novel variant (C84R) showed a
significant reduction in cAMP signal properties of the MC4R. There was a
similar response of MC4R mutation carriers and noncarriers to diet
management.

In a genomewide association study of 318,237 SNPs for insulin resistance
and related phenotypes in 2,684 Indian Asians and 11,955 individuals of
Indian Asian or European ancestry, Chambers et al. (2008) found
association between dbSNP rs12970134, located near the MC4R gene, and
waist circumference (p = 1.7 x 10(-9)). Homozygotes for the risk allele
had an approximately 2 cm greater waist circumference compared to
wildtype. The authors concluded that genetic variation near MC4R is
associated with a risk of adiposity and insulin resistance.

Loos et al. (2008) performed a metaanalysis of data from 4 European
population-based studies and 3 disease-case series, involving a total of
16,876 individuals of European descent, and found a significant
association between dbSNP rs17782313, located 188 kb downstream of the
MC4R gene, and BMI in adults (p = 2.8 x 10(-15)) and children (p = 1.5 x
10(-8)). In case-control analyses, the odds for severe childhood obesity
reached 1.30 (p = 8.0 x 10(-11)), and overtransmission of the risk
allele to obese offspring was observed in 660 families. The authors
concluded that common variants near the MC4R gene influence fat mass,
weight, and obesity risk at the population level.

Willer et al. (2009) performed a metaanalysis of 15 genomewide
association studies for BMI comprising 32,387 participants and followed
up top signals in 14 additional cohorts comprising 59,082 participants.
They strongly confirmed association with MC4R at SNP dbSNP rs17782313
with a per-allele change in BMI of 0.20 and an overall P value of 1.1 x
10(-20).

Hardy et al. (2010) genotyped variants in FTO (610966; dbSNP rs9939609)
and near MC4R (dbSNP rs17782313) in 1,240 men and 1,239 women born in
1946 and participating in the MRC National Survey of Health and
Development. Birth weight was recorded and height and weight were
measured or self-reported repeatedly at 11 time-points between ages 2
and 53 years. Hierarchical mixed models were used to test whether
genetic associations with weight or BMI standard deviation scores (SDS)
changed with age during childhood and adolescence (2-20 years) or
adulthood (20-53 years). The association between FTO dbSNP rs9939609 and
BMI SDS strengthened during childhood and adolescence (rate of change:
0.007 SDS/A-allele/year; P less than 0.001), reached a peak strength at
age 20 years (0.13 SDS/A-allele), and then weakened during adulthood
(-0.003 SDS/A-allele/year, P = 0.001). MC4R dbSNP rs17782313 showed
stronger associations with weight than BMI; its association with weight
strengthened during childhood and adolescence (0.005 SDS/C-allele/year;
P = 0.006), peaked at age 20 years (0.13 SDS/C-allele), and weakened
during adulthood (-0.002 SDS/C-allele/year, P = 0.05). Hardy et al.
(2010) concluded that genetic variants in FTO and MC4R showed similar
biphasic changes in their associations with BMI and weight,
respectively, strengthening during childhood up to age 20 years and then
weakening with increasing adult age.

CYTOGENETICS

It has been hypothesized that MC4R mutations found in association with
obesity result in a loss of MC4R gene function due to
haploinsufficiency. Cody et al. (1999) studied the molecular basis of
the phenotype of individuals with large deletions of 18q. Because of its
location at 18q21.3, the MC4R gene was hemizygous in approximately
one-third of the individuals in this study. If hemizygosity of the MC4R
gene results in haploinsufficiency-induced obesity, then individuals
with deletion of 18q whose deletions included the MC4R gene should be
obese in comparison with those individuals whose deletion did not
include the gene. The data of Cody et al. (1999) indicated no difference
in obesity among those deleted and not deleted for the gene. Thus, the
MC4R gene product must be haplosufficient, and the involvement of MC4R
in obesity may reflect a dominant-negative effect.

Heisler et al. (2002) found that genetic or pharmacologic blockade of
MC4R and MC3R (155540) is sufficient to attenuate the anorectic efficacy
of threshold doses of d-FEN (D-fenfluramine), suggesting that drugs
targeting these downstream melanocortin pathways may act in part in a
manner similar to d-FEN to decrease food intake and body weight with
fewer side effects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Huszar et al. (1997) found that inactivation of the melanocortin-4
receptor by gene targeting in mice resulted in a maturity-onset obesity
syndrome associated with hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, and
hyperglycinemia. This syndrome recapitulated several of the
characteristic features of the 'agouti' syndrome, which results from
ectopic expression of agouti protein (600201), a pigmentation factor
normally expressed in the skin. The findings identified a novel
signaling pathway in the mouse for body weight regulation and supported
a model in which the primary mechanism by which agouti induces obesity
is chronic antagonism of the melanocortin-4 receptor.

Marsh et al. (1999) found that the leptin resistance of obese Mc4r -/-
mice does not prevent their response to the anorectic actions of ciliary
neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 118945), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF;
122560), or urocortin (UCN; 600945); or the orexigenic
(appetite-stimulating) actions of neuropeptide Y (NPY; 162640) or
peptide YY (PYY; 600781), indicating that these neuromodulators act
independently or downstream of Mc4r signaling. Marsh et al. (1999)
showed that homozygous Mc4r-deficient mice do not respond to the
anorectic action of a melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)-like agonist,
suggesting that alpha-MSH (see 176830) inhibits feeding primarily by
activating Mc4r.

Kim et al. (2000) studied MC4R as a candidate gene for the control of
economically important growth and performance traits in the pig. They
found a missense mutation in a region highly conserved among
melanocortin receptor genes: a G-to-A transition at a position
corresponding to human codon 298, changing GAU (asp) to AAU (asn). The
asp298 allele was associated with less backfat thickness, slower growth
rate, and lower feed intake. In an association study of this MC4R
polymorphism in a large number of individual animals from several
different pig lines, they found a significant association of MC4R
genotypes with backfat, growth rate, and feed intake in a number of
lines. The authors considered it likely that the variant amino acid
residue of the MC4R mutation (or a closely linked mutation) causes a
significant change of the MC4R function.

Chen et al. (2000) evaluated the potential role of MC3R in energy
homeostasis by studying Mc3r-deficient (Mc3r -/-) mice and compared the
functions of Mc3r and Mc4r in mice deficient for both genes. Mice
lacking both Mc3r and Mc4r became significantly heavier than Mc4r -/-
mice. Chen et al. (2000) concluded that Mc3r and Mc4r serve nonredundant
roles in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Cummings and Schwartz
(2000) showed that these studies demonstrated that the 2 melanocortin
receptor isoforms reduce body weight through distinct and complementary
mechanisms. Mc4r regulates food intake and possibly energy expenditure,
whereas Mc3r influences feed efficiency and the petitioning of fuel
stores into fat.

Ste. Marie et al. (2000) studied Mc4r-null mice to determine whether
aberrant metabolism contributes to their late-onset obesity. The
consumption of the null mice was restricted to (i.e., pair-fed with)
that of wildtype mice. The null females maintained body weights
intermediate to those of wildtype and nonpair-fed null females, whereas
pair-feeding normalized the body weights of null male mice. These and
other findings indicated that Mc4r deficiency enhances caloric
efficiency, similar to that seen in the agouti obesity syndrome and in
Mc3r-null mice.

By a combination of genetic, pharmacologic, and anatomic approaches, Van
der Ploeg et al. (2002) showed that MC4R, implicated in the control of
food intake and energy expenditure, also modulates erectile function and
sexual behavior. Evidence was based on several findings: a highly
selective nonpeptide MC4R agonist augmented erectile activity initiated
by electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve in wildtype, but not
Mc4r-null, mice; copulatory behavior was enhanced by administration of a
selective MC4R agonist and was diminished in mice lacking Mc4r; RT-PCR-
and non-PCR-based methods demonstrated MC4R expression in rat and human
penis, and rat spinal cord, hypothalamus, brainstem, and pelvic ganglion
(major autonomic relay center to the penis), but not in rat primary
corpus smooth muscle cavernosum cells; and in situ hybridization of
glans tissue from the human and rat penis revealed MC4R expression in
nerve fibers and mechanoreceptors in the glans of the penis.
Collectively, these data implicated MC4R in the modulation of penile
erectile function and provided evidence that MC4R-mediated proerectile
responses may be activated through neuronal circuitry in spinal cord
erectile centers and somatosensory afferent nerve terminals of the
penis. The results supported the existence of MC4R-controlled neuronal
pathways that control sexual function.

Xu et al. (2003) found that, like MC4R mutants, mouse mutants that
express decreased amounts of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF; 113505) receptor TrkB (600456) showed hyperphagia and
maturity-onset obesity, suggesting a role for BDNF in energy balance.
The authors found that BDNF is an anorexigenic factor that is highly
expressed in murine ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) nuclei and is
regulated by feeding status. Deficiency in MC4R signaling reduced
expression of BDNF in the VMH, indicating that BDNF and its receptor
TrkB are downstream components in the MC4R-mediated control of energy
balance.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OBESITY
MC4R, 4-BP DEL, NT631

Yeo et al. (1998) identified a cohort of severely obese (601665)
children in whom no evidence for a recognized clinical syndrome or a
structural hypothalamic cause for their obesity was found. In 1 of 63 of
these subjects screened for MC4R mutations, they identified
heterozygosity for a 4-bp deletion at codon 211 of the MC4R gene. The
deletion of CTCT resulted in a missing leucine and a frameshift that
introduced a stop codon 5 amino acids downstream of the deletion. This
disrupted the fifth transmembrane domain of the receptor and resulted in
a truncated protein of 215 residues. The index patient was 4 years old
and the only child of a nonconsanguineous union. Although his
birthweight was 3.8 kg (50th centile), progressive weight gain led to a
weight of 32 kg (more than 99th centile) at the age of 4 years. There
was a history of hyperphagia with constant food seeking and distress
when food was not provided. Fasting serum leptin concentration was
appropriate for the degree of obesity. The mother was not obese and had
a normal appetite. The father, aged 30 years, weighed 139 kg at a height
of 185 cm. He was also of normal birth weight, but his weight began to
deviate from predicted centiles at 6 months of age. He was found to be
heterozygous for the same mutation. He had no sibs and no further
information concerning his parents was available.

MC4R, 4-BP INS, NT732

Vaisse et al. (1998) used PCR-SSCP with 5 primer pairs covering the
entire single exon of MC4R to screen for mutations in 43 individuals
with morbid obesity (601665). A single patient was found to have
heterozygosity for a frameshift mutation, a 4-bp insertion at nucleotide
732 resulting in expression of a nonfunctional, truncated receptor
lacking the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains. The patient was a
35-year-old woman with obesity that developed in infancy. Her birth
weight was normal. Her weight was 45 kg with a height of 141 cm at age
10 years, and 80 kg with a height of 163 cm at age 20. Blood glucose and
plasmid lipid levels were normal; serum leptin levels were consistent
with her adiposity. She belonged to a large family of obese subjects:
her mother, sister, niece, and a younger brother were also obese.

OBESITY
MC4R, TYR35TER

In 2 obese (601665) probands (BMI, 31.29 kg/m2 and 45.91 kg/m2,
respectively), Hinney et al. (1999) identified a C-to-A transversion at
nucleotide 105 of the MC4R gene, resulting in a tyr35-to-ter
substitution. This mutation led to a truncated protein that encompassed
the N-terminal extracellular domain. Both carriers also showed an A-to-T
transversion at nucleotide 110, resulting in an asp37-to-val
substitution (155541.0004). In both cases these mutations were
maternally transmitted, indicating they form a haplotype.

.0005
OBESITY
MC4R, VAL50MET

In a severely obese (601665) child, Dubern et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 148 of the MC4R gene, resulting in a
valine-to-methionine substitution at codon 50 in the first transmembrane
domain of the melanocortin-4 receptor. This mutation was found in
heterozygosity in this patient and was not identified in any of the 283
nonobese adults.

.0006
OBESITY
MC4R, SER58CYS

In 1 of 63 obese (601665) children screened for mutations of MC4R,
Dubern et al. (2001) identified an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 172
of the MC4R gene, resulting in a ser-to-cys substitution at codon 58 in
the first transmembrane domain of the melanocortin-4 receptor. This
mutation was not identified in any of 283 nonobese adults. Not all
mutation-carrying family members were obese.

.0007
OBESITY
MC4R, ILE102SER

In 1 of 63 obese (601665) children, Dubern et al. (2001) identified a
T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 305 of the MC4R gene, resulting in an
isoleucine-to-serine substitution at codon 102 in the second
transmembrane domain of the melanocortin-4 receptor.

Through detailed functional characterization of cell surface expression,
ligand binding, and signaling properties, Tao and Segaloff (2005)
determined that the I102T variant results in loss of function of the
MC4R protein.

.0008
OBESITY
MC4R, ILE170VAL

In 1 of 63 obese (601665) children, Dubern et al. (2001) identified an
A-to-G transition at nucleotide 508 of the MC4R gene, resulting in an
isoleucine-to-valine substitution at codon 170 in the fourth
transmembrane domain of the melanocortin-4 receptor.

OBESITY
MC4R, ASN274SER

Mergen et al. (2001) determined the nucleotide sequence of the entire
coding region of the MC4R gene in 40 morbidly obese (601665) subjects
from independent families. The authors reported a novel heterozygous
mutation, asn274 to ser (N274S), in an obese female (age, 52 years;
height, 158 cm; weight, 104 kg; BMI, 41.7 kg/m2). The sister of the
proband (age, 55 years; height, 160 cm; weight, 110 kg; BMI, 43 kg/m2)
carried the same mutation. Although both sisters were morbidly obese and
hypertensive, the proband had normal plasma insulin and fasting blood
glucose levels, whereas her sister had type II diabetes mellitus
(125853). No abnormalities of the reproductive function were present.
Despite marked hyperphagia in childhood, both sisters had a history of
relatively diminished intensity of appetite after the age of 20.

.0010
OBESITY
MC4R, 1-BP INS, 112A

In a proband and his mother and sister, all with early-onset obesity
(601665), Farooqi et al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for a
frameshift mutation in the MC4R gene, 112insA, which resulted in
complete loss of activity of the protein.

.0011
OBESITY
MC4R, 4-BP DEL, 211CTCT

In a father and son with early-onset obesity (601665), Farooqi et al.
(2003) identified heterozygosity for a frameshift mutation in the MC4R
gene, 211delCTCT, which resulted in complete loss of activity of the
protein.

.0012
OBESITY
MC4R, 2-BP INS, 279GT

In each of 2 presumably unrelated families, Farooqi et al. (2003) found
that the father and 1 child with early-onset obesity (601665) were
heterozygous for a frameshift mutation in the MC4R gene, 279insGT, which
resulted in complete loss of activity of the protein.

.0013
OBESITY
MC4R, ILE125LYS

In each of 2 presumably unrelated families, Farooqi et al. (2003) found
that a parent and 1 child with early-onset obesity (601665) were
heterozygous for an ile125-to-lys (I125K) mutation in the MC4R gene. The
protein showed no activity on in vitro assay.

Yeo et al. (2003) demonstrated that the I125K mutation was completely
unable to generate cAMP in response to ligand.

.0014
OBESITY
MC4R, CYS271TYR

In a family with early-onset obesity (601665) in 8 individuals in 3
successive generations, Farooqi et al. (2003) found that affected
individuals were heterozygous for a cys271-to-tyr (C271Y) mutation in
the MC4R gene. The protein showed no activity on in vitro assay.

Yeo et al. (2003) observed that the C271Y mutation was completely unable
to generate cAMP in response to ligand and showed impaired cell surface
expression.

.0015
OBESITY
MC4R, ALA175THR

In a mother and son with early-onset obesity (601665), Farooqi et al.
(2003) found heterozygosity for an ala175-to-thr (A175T) mutation in the
MC4R gene. The protein showed partial activity on in vitro assay.

.0016
OBESITY
MC4R, ILE316SER

In a family in which there was extensive consanguinity, Farooqi et al.
(2003) found that early-onset obesity (601665) in 6 individuals in 2
generations was associated with heterozygosity for an ile316-to-ser
(I316S) mutation in the MC4R gene. In a second, unrelated family, the
authors found that early-onset obesity in a mother and 3 daughters was
associated with this mutation. The protein showed partial activity on in
vitro assay in both families.

Yeo et al. (2003) observed that the I316S mutant protein showed reduced
affinity for alpha-MSH (see 176830), but retained normal affinity for
the antagonist agouti-related protein (AGRP; 602311).

.0017
OBESITY
MC4R, TYR287TER

In a proband with early-onset obesity (601665), Farooqi et al. (2003)
found homozygosity for a tyr287-to-ter (Y287X) mutation in the MC4R
gene; the mother and a sister were also obese but were heterozygous for
the mutation. On in vitro assay, the protein showed no activity.

Yeo et al. (2003) demonstrated that the Y287X mutation showed impaired
cell surface expression.

.0018
OBESITY
MC4R, ASN97ASP

In a proband with early-onset obesity (601665), Farooqi et al. (2003)
found homozygosity for an asn97-to-asp (N97D) mutation in the MC4R gene;
her consanguineous parents and a sister were also obese but were
heterozygous for the mutation. On in vitro assay, the protein showed no
activity.

Yeo et al. (2003) demonstrated that the N97D mutation was completely
unable to generate cAMP in response to ligand.

.0019
OBESITY
MC4R, ASN62SER

In an inbred family in which 10 individuals in 3 generations had
early-onset obesity (601665), Farooqi et al. (2003) found that the
proband and 4 of his cousins were homozygous for an asn62-to-ser (N62S)
mutation in the MC4R gene. The consanguineous parents in each case were
heterozygous for the mutation and showed obesity that was less severe.
On in vitro assay, the protein showed partial activity.

.0020
OBESITY
MC4R, 15-BP DEL

In a female patient with onset of obesity (601665) at less than 5 years
of age, Donohoue et al. (2003) detected an in-frame deletion in the MC4R
gene of codons 88 through 92 (delta88-92). These codons were predicted
to lie within the second transmembrane domain. Functional analysis
revealed that the mutant receptor was expressed well on the cell surface
but was completely devoid of ligand binding and cAMP generation in
response to agonist stimulation.

.0021
OBESITY
MC4R, SER127LEU

In a 14.8-year-old boy with severe early-onset obesity (601665),
Valli-Jaakola et al. (2004) identified a ser127-to-leu (S127L) mutation
in the melanocortin-4 receptor. Abnormal weight gain began in the second
year of life. The patient presented with acanthosis nigricans in the
neck and axillae and demonstrated marked hyperinsulinemia during an oral
glucose tolerance test despite normal glucose tolerance. Blood pressure
was normal for age. His father, in whom the same mutation was found,
suffered form severe obesity in childhood although the phenotype became
less apparent in adulthood. Functional studies in transiently
transfected 239T cells indicated that signaling properties of the
receptor in response to the MC4R agonists alpha-MSH, beta-MSH, and
gamma-1-MSH (see 176830) were impaired. Valli-Jaakola et al. (2004)
noted that this mutation had been reported by Lubrano-Berthelier et al.
(2003) and Hinney et al. (2003) in a total of 4 patients.

.0022
OBESITY
MC4R, 2-BP DEL, 750GA

In an obese (601665) child of first-cousin parents of North African
origin, Lubrano-Berthelier et al. (2004) detected a homozygous 2-bp
deletion in the MC4R gene (delta750-751GA). MC4R activity was completely
absent. The parents and all sibs of the proband were heterozygous for
the mutation. Lubrano-Berthelier et al. (2004) compared the clinical and
endocrine characteristics of this patient with those observed in leptin
receptor (601007)-deficient patients. They concluded that in humans, the
MC4R mediates most of the anorectic effects of leptin (164160) in early
childhood. In contrast, MC4R does not mediate the effect of leptin on
linear growth and other endocrine axes. In addition, complete MC4R
deficiency is not a cause of relative hyperinsulinemia.

.0023
OBESITY
MC4R, ALA219VAL

In a study of the MC4R gene in 750 Danish men with juvenile-onset
obesity (601665) and 706 control subjects, Larsen et al. (2005) detected
a novel missense mutation in 1 subject, ala219 to val (A219V), that
arose from a 656C-to-T transition. The A219V variant showed significant
impairment of cAMP-induced activity in response to melanotan II (MTII)
compared with the wildtype receptor (34%).

612383	TITLE *612383 MEDIATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 11; MED11
;;HSPC296
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MED11 is a component of the Mediator complex, which is a coactivator for
DNA-binding factors that activate transcription via RNA polymerase II
(Sato et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using HeLa cells overexpressing epitope-tagged MED10 (612382), Sato et
al. (2003) purified several components of the human Mediator complex,
including MED11, which they called HSPC296, and they cloned the
corresponding cDNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro-translated epitope-tagged proteins for protein-binding
assays, Sato et al. (2003) found that MED11 directly interacted with the
mediator subunit SURF5 (MED22; 185641). The MED11-SURF5 heterodimer
could also be coimmunoprecipitated from cotransfected insect cells or
Escherichia coli.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MED11 gene to chromosome 16p13.2 based on an
alignment of the MED11 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF161414) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

;;FERREDOXIN:NADP(+) REDUCTASE;;
ADRENODOXIN REDUCTASE; ADXR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Adrenodoxin reductase (ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase; EC 1.18.1.2) is a
mitochondrial flavoprotein that receives electrons from NADPH, thus
initiating the electron-transport chain serving mitochondrial
cytochromes P450.

CLONING

Solish et al. (1988) cloned and sequenced 2 human ADXR cDNAs that
differed by the presence of 6 additional codons in the middle of 1
clone. The sequence in this region of the clones indicated that these 6
extra codons rose by alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA. Lin et al.
(1990) identified 2 forms of ADXR mRNA, which differed by the absence or
presence of 18 bases in the middle of the sequence; these arise through
alternative splicing at the 5-prime end of exon 7.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lin et al. (1990) found that the ADXR gene spans 12 kb and consists of
12 exons. The first exon encodes the first 26 of the 32 amino acids of
the signal peptide, and the second exon encodes the remainder of the
signal peptide and the apparent FAD binding site. The remaining 10 exons
are clustered in a region of only 4.3 kb, separated from the first 2
exons by a large intron of about 5.6 kb. Southern blot analysis
indicated that the human genome contains only 1 ADXR gene.

MAPPING

By analysis of DNA from a panel of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids,
Solish et al. (1988) localized the gene to 17cen-q25. By in situ
hybridization, Sparkes et al. (1991) refined the assignment to
17q24-q25.

608786	TITLE *608786 PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE; PC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. It is
a key regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and
neurotransmitter synthesis. Human PC is a tetramer composed of identical
subunits (Barden et al., 1974).

CLONING

Using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the amino acid sequence at
the biotin site of pyruvate carboxylase to screen a human liver cDNA
library, Freytag and Collier (1984) isolated 3 cDNA clones for pyruvate
carboxylase. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2-kb mRNA.

Wexler et al. (1994) isolated a PC cDNA, which encodes a deduced
1,178-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 129.6 kD for the
full-length precursor and 127.4 kD for the mature apoprotein. Northern
blot analysis demonstrated that the highest level of PC mRNA is in the
liver. Based on homology with other biotin-containing proteins, the ATP,
pyruvate, and biotin-binding sites were identified. MacKay et al. (1994)
isolated and cloned PC cDNA from human kidney.

Carbone et al. (1998) characterized the PC gene by PCR amplification,
subcloning, and sequencing.

GENE STRUCTURE

Carbone et al. (1998) determined that the PC gene contains 19 exons
spanning approximately 16 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Using Southern blotting of human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids,
Freytag and Collier (1984) localized the PC gene to the long arm of
chromosome 11.

Rochelle et al. (1992) indicated that the corresponding locus in the
mouse is located on chromosome 19 near the centromere. Comparative
mapping suggested that the human PC locus is in the proximal part of
11q, perhaps 11q12-q13.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization to normal chromosomes and
chromosomes carrying the FRA11A (136560) fragile site, Walker et al.
(1995) mapped PC to 11q13, distal to FRA11A, thus localizing it to
11q13.4-q13.5. Perucca-Lostanlen et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ
hybridization with yeast artificial chromosome and cosmid probes on
metaphase chromosomes of patients expressing the fragile site to show
that FRA11A is situated centromeric to ACTN3 (102574) and telomeric to
D11S913, these markers being within an interval of approximately 1 Mb in
the 11q13.3 region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 11 Ojibwa and 2 Cree patients with group A pyruvate carboxylase
deficiency (266150), Carbone et al. (1998) identified a missense
mutation in the PC gene (608786.0001). In 2 brothers of Micmac origin,
they identified a transversion mutation in the PC gene (608786.0002).
Carrier frequency was estimated to be as high as 1 in 10 in some
groupings. The 2 point mutations were located in the region of homology
conserved among yeast, rat, and human PC, in the vicinity of the
carboxylation domain of the enzyme.

NOMENCLATURE

Brun et al. (1999) referred to pyruvate carboxylase as a key enzyme in
the gluconeogenesis and anaplerotic metabolic pathways. Anaplerotic is a
somewhat archaic term derived from the Greek stems ana, meaning 'for
up,' and plerotic, meaning 'for filling.' The adjective anaplerotic
refers to a reaction that effects best the formation of an intermediate
of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, in order to maintain the intracellular
concentration of it, or of another such intermediate, as those
intermediates are utilized for biosynthesis.

In 11 Ojibwa and 2 Cree Amerindian patients with simple pyruvate
carboxylase deficiency (266150), Carbone et al. (1998) identified a
homozygous 1828G-A transition in the PC gene, resulting in an
ala610-to-thr (A610T) substitution.

In 2 Micmac brothers from Nova Scotia with simple pyruvate carboxylase
deficiency (266150), Carbone et al. (1998) identified a 2229G-T
transversion in the PC gene, resulting in a met743-to-ile (M743I)
substitution in the carboxylation domain of the enzyme.

.0003

PC, VAL145ALA

In affected members of a consanguineous family with PC deficiency
(266150), Wexler et al. (1998) identified a homozygous 434T-C transition
in the PC gene, resulting in a val145-to-ala (V145A) substitution. Both
parents were heterozygous for the mutation. The patients were found to
have low PC activity (range 2-25% of control) in blood lymphocytes and
skin fibroblasts associated with either diminished or normal protein
levels.

PC, ARG451CYS

In an affected brother and sister from a consanguineous family with PC
deficiency (266150), Wexler et al. (1998) identified a homozygous
1351C-T transition the PC gene, resulting in an arg451-to-cys (R451C)
substitution. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Both
mutations occurred in relatively conserved amino acid residues and were
located in the biotin carboxylase domain.

.0005
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, IVS15, 4-BP DEL, TAGG, +2-5

In 2 brothers with severe (type B) pyruvate carboxylase deficiency
(266150), Carbone et al. (2002) found compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the PC gene: a TAGG deletion at the exon 15/intron 15
splice site (IVS15+2-5delTAGG) and a dinucleotide deletion in exon 16
(2491-2492delGT; 608786.0006). By RT-PCR and sequencing of aberrant
transcripts, Carbone et al. (2002) found that the splice site mutation
resulted in the retention of intron 15 during pre-mRNA splicing. In
addition, both deletions were predicted to result in a frameshift to
generate a premature termination codon such that the encoded mRNA would
be subject to nonsense-mediated decay. In 1 brother, the diagnosis was
made at the age of 4 hours and death occurred at 7 weeks; in the younger
brother, the diagnosis was made in the fetus and death was in the
neonatal period.

In a patient with type A PC deficiency (266150), Monnot et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous 467G-A transition in exon 3 of the PC gene,
resulting in an arg156-to-gln (R156Q) substitution in the biotin
carboxylase domain. The mutation had no detectable effect on mRNA size
or amount. Monnot et al. (2009) observed that the relatively milder type
A phenotype results from missense mutations in the PC gene.

.0008
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, ARG583LEU

In a patient with type B PC deficiency (266150), Monnot et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PC gene: a
1748G-T transversion in exon 12, resulting in an arg583-to-leu (R583L)
substitution in the carboxytransferase domain, and a 1-bp duplication in
exon 17 (2876dupT; 608786.0009), resulting in a frameshift,
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and no functional protein. The R583L
mutation had no detectable effect on mRNA size or amount. Monnot et al.
(2009) commented that patients with the relatively more severe type B
tend to have at least 1 truncating mutation in the PC gene.

;;HISTOCOMPATIBILITY (MINOR) HA-1;;
HLA-HA1;;
KIAA0223
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against minor histocompatibility
antigens of the host were demonstrated in blood from recipients of bone
marrow from donors who were genotypically HLA identical. Clones of such
cytotoxic T cells were isolated from lymphocyte populations in the blood
of patients with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; see 614395).
These clones were used as reagents to identify 5 nonsex-linked minor
histocompatibility antigens, designated HA-1, -2 (600642) , -3, -4, and
-5 by van Els et al. (1992). Most of the cytotoxic-T-cell clones
isolated from various patients reacted against HA-1 (van Els et al.,
1992). Goulmy et al. (1996) stated that for immune recognition, the
HA-1, -2, -4, and -5 antigens must be presented to cytotoxic T cells by
the major histocompatibility antigen HLA-A2. In this way, they behave
like antigens recognized in an HLA-restricted fashion. The HA-1 antigen
is present in 69% of normal people who express HLA-A2, whereas the
frequencies of the 3 others in this set of HLA-A2-restricted minor
histocompatibility antigens are either high (95% for HA-2); or low (16%
of HA-4 and 7% for HA-5). The HLA-1-restricted minor histocompatibility
antigen HA-3 occurs in 88% of persons positive for HLA-A1. HA-1, -2, -4,
and -5 are inherited independently of the HLA genes; each of them is
encoded by a single gene, and none has a locus within the HLA region
(Schreuder et al., 1993).

GENE FUNCTION

To investigate whether mismatching of minor histocompatibility antigens
contributes to acute GVHD in recipients of genotypically HLA-identical
bone marrow, Goulmy et al. (1996) studied 148 bone marrow recipients and
their sib donors. Fifty pairs were positive for HLA-A1, 117 were
positive for HLA-A2, and 19 were positive for both. The pairs were typed
with cytotoxic-T-cell clones specific for HA-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5. A
mismatch of only HA-1 was significantly correlated with GVHD of grade II
or higher in adults.

Den Haan et al. (1998) identified HA-1 as a nonapeptide derived from a
partial cDNA sequence, designated KIAA0223, derived from the acute
myelogenous leukemia KG-1. HA-1 has the amino acid sequence VLHDDLLEA,
termed HA-1(H). A single amino acid substitution of arginine for
histidine leads to HA-1-negative status, termed HA-1(R). Den Haan et al.
(1998) found that HA-1(H) is presented by its recognizing antigen,
HLA-A*0201, while HA-1(R) is not. The binding affinity of the HA-1(R)
peptide for HLA-A*0201 is 1/12 that of HA-1(H). The authors concluded
that HA-1(R) is a null allele and that only bone marrow transplantation
from an HA-1(R/R) donor to an HA-1(H/H) or HA-1(H/R) recipient, and not
the reverse, would be significantly associated with GVHD. Den Haan et
al. (1998) suggested that HA-1 typing before bone marrow transplantation
of HLA-matched donor-recipient combinations would improve bone marrow
donor selection and prediction of HA-1-induced GVHD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kaminski et al. (2000) determined that the HA-1 gene contains 23 exons
and spans 16 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the KIAA0223
gene to chromosome 19. Kaminski et al. (2000) mapped the HA-1 gene to
chromosome 19p13.3 based on sequence identity shared with a BAC clone
mapped to 19p13.3.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By examining genes arising from intra- and interchromosomal duplications
involving the ancestral chromosome 2 fusion site, Fan et al. (2002)
identified FOXD4L1 (611084), FOXD4L2 (611085), and FOXD4L3. The deduced
417-amino acid FOXD4L3 protein contains a central forkhead domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fan et al. (2002) determined that FOXD4L3 is a single-exon gene, and
they identified a TATA box in the promoter region.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fan et al. (2002) mapped the FOXD4L3 gene
to chromosome 9q13.

;;SCOTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding Scotin, which they called
HSPC217, from CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. The deduced 170-amino acid protein contains an MYB (189990)
DNA-binding domain repeat signature. Microarray analysis of 5
hematopoietic cell lines detected low-level expression of Scotin in NB4
and Jurkat cells, but no expression was detected in HL60, K562, and U937
cells.

Bourdon et al. (2002) identified mouse Scotin by differential display of
spleen and thymus of normal and p53 (191170) null mice after gamma
irradiation of whole animals. The induced 1.85-kb transcript encodes a
deduced 235-amino acid protein. By searching an EST database using the
mouse sequence as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bourdon
et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Scotin from a placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 240-amino acid human protein shares 70%
identity with mouse Scotin. Both the human and the mouse proteins
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a central transmembrane domain
composed of 18 hydrophobic amino acids, and a proline/tyrosine domain,
and both show an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western blot
analysis. Immunolocalization of exogenously expressed Scotin revealed
colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. By mutation
analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the proline-rich domain
is required for ER localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bourdon et al. (2002) noted that mouse thymus and spleen cells underwent
massive p53-dependent apoptosis following ultraviolet irradiation or
exposure to actinomycin D. They found that Scotin mRNA was induced
coincident with apoptosis and was expressed only in spleen and thymus of
irradiated wildtype mice and not in the spleen or thymus of irradiated
p53 null mice. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they
confirmed direct binding between p53 and Scotin, and using a luciferase
reporter plasmid driven by the mouse Scotin promoter, they confirmed
dose-dependent p53 transactiviation. Furthermore, Bourdon et al. (2002)
showed that the apoptosis induced by the p53/Scotin pathway is caspase
dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the
human Scotin gene contains 6 exons. They identified a p53-responsive
element of 9 decamers within the mouse Scotin promoter.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the human
Scotin gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et
al. (2002) mapped the Scotin gene to chromosome 3p21.3. They also
identified a Scotin pseudogene on chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

;;TSA2;;
MALE MEIOTIC METAPHASE CHROMOSOME-ASSOCIATED ACIDIC PROTEIN; MEICHROACIDIN;;
TESTIS-SPECIFIC PROTEIN 2; TSGA2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RSPH1 gene is the homolog of the Chlamydomonas radial spoke head 1
gene, which encodes a protein that localizes to cilia and flagella
(summary by Kott et al., 2013).

CLONING

Tsuchida et al. (1998) cloned the mouse Tsa2 gene, which they called
meichroacidin, from a testis cDNA library. The deduced 284-amino acid
protein has an acidic N terminus, followed by 6 repeat sequences, a
7-glutamic acid sequence, a short hydrophobic region, and an acidic C
terminus. It also contains several potential phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected highest
expression in testis, with much lower expression in ovary, and no
expression in any other tissue examined. Tsa2 was expressed in neonatal
mouse testis beginning at day 12, and high expression was detected in
testis from day 14 to adult. Western blot analysis detected Tsa2 at an
apparent molecular mass of 40 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated
that Tsa2 was expressed in the cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes
through to round spermatids. However, during the disappearance of the
nuclear envelope at both the first and second meiotic divisions, Tsa2
localized around metaphase chromosomes and spindles.

By quantitative RT-PCR, Kott et al. (2013) found expression of human
RSPH1 in tissues with motile cilia or flagella, including the trachea,
lungs, airway brushings, and testes. Expression of RSPH1 was similar to
that of other radial spoke-head proteins, such as RSPH4A (612647). RSPH1
localized to the cilia in nasal brushings.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TSGA2
gene to chromosome 21 (TMAP SHGC-30133).

By interspecific backcross analysis, Taketo et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse Tsa2 gene to the proximal region of chromosome 17.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 12 patients from 10 families with primary ciliary dyskinesia-24
without situs inversus (CILD24; 615481), Kott et al. (2013) identified 7
biallelic mutations in the RSPH1 gene (see, e.g.,
609314.0001-609314.0005). The mutation in the first patient was found by
a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing. The
subsequent mutations were found in patients from a larger cohort of 36
families with CILD characterized by ciliary central microtubule complex
and radial spoke defects. Respiratory cilia from 1 affected individual
showed undetectable RSPH1 protein, consistent with a loss of function.
Overall, RSPH1 mutations accounted for 20.8% of the 48 families studied
with this specific phenotype. Kott et al. (2013) noted that patients
with RSPH1 mutations do not have situs inversus because central complex
defects do not affect the 9+0 structure of embryonic nodal cilia.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 24, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS
RSPH1, GLU29TER (dbSNP 138320978)

In a girl of North African descent, born of consanguineous parents, with
primary ciliary dyskinesia-24 without situs inversus (CILD24; 615481),
Kott et al. (2013) identified a homozygous c.85G-T transversion in exon
2 of the RSPH1 gene, resulting in a glu29-to-ter (E29X) substitution.
The mutation was found by homozygosity mapping combined with whole-exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing; DNA from the parents was
not available. The variant (dbSNP rs138320978) was found at a low
frequency (0.00038) in the Exome Variant Server database, but was not
found in homozygous state in 2,276 control individuals. This low
frequency was compatible with the expected frequency of a CILD allele.
Screening for RSPH1 mutations in 36 additional families with CILD and
central complex defects identified another male patient of North African
descent who was homozygous for the E29X mutation as well as 3 additional
patients of European descent who were compound heterozygous for E29X and
another pathogenic mutation in the RSPH1 gene (see, e.g., 609314.0002
and 609324.0005). All patients had early onset of sinopulmonary
infections and some had infertility; none had situs inversus.

.0002
CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 24, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS
RSPH1, IVS4AS, C-A, -3

In 2 unrelated male patients of European descent with CILD24 without
situs inversus (615481), Kott et al. (2013) identified compound
heterozygosity for a C-to-A transversion in intron 4 of the RSPH1 gene
(c.366-3C-A) and another pathogenic mutation (E29X; 609314.0001 and
407_410delAGTA; 609314.0003, respectively). The c.366-3C-A mutation was
not found in the dbSNP, Ensembl, or Exome Variant Server databases. It
occurred at a highly conserved nucleotide and was predicted to affect
splicing. The 4-bp deletion (c.407delAGTA) was predicted to result in
premature termination (Lys136MetfsTer6).

In 5 patients from 3 European families with CILD24 without situs
inversus (615481), Kott et al. (2013) identified a homozygous A-to-C
transversion in intron 3 of the RSPH1 gene (c.275-2A-C). RT-PCR showed
that the mutation leads to the skipping of exons 4 and 5 and results in
premature termination (Gly92AlafsTer10). Another patient was compound
heterozygous for this splice site mutation and another pathogenic
mutation. The c.275-2A-C mutation was present in dbSNP (dbSNP
rs151107532) and at a low frequency (0.001) in the Exome Variant Server
database, which is compatible with the expected frequency of a CILD
allele. The homozygous genotype was not found among 2,937 individuals.

.0005

RSPH1, GLY103ASP

In a patient with CILD24 without situs inversus (615481), Kott et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygosity for a c.308G-A transition in
exon 4 of the RSPH1 gene, resulting in a gly103-to-asp (G103D)
substitution at a highly conserved residue, and E29X (609314.0001). The
G103D mutation was not found in the Exome Variant Server, Ensembl, or
dbSNP databases.

607348	TITLE *607348 HAIRY/ENHANCER OF SPLIT, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 5; HES5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Takebayashi et al. (1995) cloned mouse Hes5. Hes5 contains a basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain that shares 96% identity with the bHLH
region of rat Hes5. In situ hybridization showed that Hes5 was expressed
at high levels throughout the developing mouse central nervous system.
Prominent expression was observed in the wall of embryonic brain
vesicles and in developing spinal cord.

By searching databases using mouse Hes5 as query, Katoh and Katoh (2004)
identified human HES5. The deduced 166-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal bHLH domain, followed by an orange domain, a proline-rich
domain, and a C-terminal WRPW motif. HES5 ESTs were found in fetal heart
and brain tumor cDNA libraries.

GENE FUNCTION

Using deletion analysis of the mouse Hes5 promoter, Takebayashi et al.
(1995) determined that 2 GC stretches could direct expression of a
reporter plasmid in undifferentiated neural cells. They also found that
expression of Hes5 was reduced upon differentiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the HES5 gene contains at least 3
exons.

Takebayashi et al. (1995) determined that the mouse Hes5 gene has 3
exons. The promoter region of the mouse Hes5 gene contains a TATA motif
and multiple GC elements.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the HES5
gene to chromosome 1p36.32, between the PANK4 (606162) and TNRFSF14
(602746) genes.

606510	TITLE *606510 Fc RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN 3; FCRL3
;;FCRH3
DESCRIPTION Receptors for the Fc region (FcRs) of immunoglobulins (Igs) modulate
cellular and humoral immunity by linking their antibody ligands with
effector cells of the immune system. FcRs sense humoral concentrations
of antibody, initiate cellular responses in host defense, and
participate in autoimmune disorders.

CLONING

By database searching using a consensus sequence corresponding to the
second Ig-like domains of FCGR1A (146760), FCGR2A (146790), and FCGR3A
(146740) as well as the third Ig-like domain of the polymeric Ig
receptor (PIGR; 173880), Davis et al. (2001) identified 2 BAC clones
located at chromosome 1q21.1-q22. They found that one of these clones
contained 3 novel putative Ig superfamily genes, which they designated
FCRH1 (606508), FCRH2 (SPAP1; 606509), and FCRH3, as well as 2
previously identified members of this family, FCRH4 (IRTA1; 605876) and
FCRH5 (IRTA2; 605877). Sequence analysis predicted that the 734-amino
acid type I transmembrane protein possesses a hydrophobic signal
peptide, 6 extracellular C2 type Ig-like domains, 7 N-linked
glycosylation sites, an uncharged transmembrane segment, and a 140-amino
acid cytoplasmic tail with 1 ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
activation motif), 1 ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
motif), and an ITAM-like region. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of approximately 3.5-, 5.5- and 7.0-kb transcripts, chiefly
in spleen and lymph nodes but also in peripheral blood lymphocytes,
thymus, and bone marrow, and an approximately 1.35-kb transcript in
skeletal muscle. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in mature B-cell
lines. Davis et al. (2001) suggested that FCRH3 may have an
activating/inhibitory or a fine-tuning role in regulation of immunologic
function.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Davis et al. (2001) determined that the
FCRH3 gene contains 11 exons spanning approximately 28 kb.

MAPPING

By BAC and genomic sequence analysis, Davis et al. (2001) mapped the
FCRH3 gene to chromosome 1q21.2-q22, near the classic FCGR loci.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kochi et al. (2005) concluded that FCRL3 may have a pivotal role in
autoimmunity. They identified a SNP in the promoter region of FCRL3 that
is associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (180300),
autoimmune thyroid disease (see 608173), and systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700). The polymorphism alters the binding affinity of
nuclear factor-kappa-B (see 164011) and regulates FCRL3 expression. They
observed high FCRL3 expression on B cells and augmented autoantibody
production in individuals with the disease-susceptible genotype.

By means of an association study using nonsynonymous SNPs and tag SNPs
from the major histocompatibility complex, the (Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium and The Australo-Anglo-American Spondylitis
Consortium, 2007) confirmed the association of autoimmune thyroid
disease with FCRL3 reported by Kochi et al. (2005).

608487	TITLE *608487 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; TRIM5
;;RNF88
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIM5 belongs to the large tripartite motif protein family, members of
which typically are composed of 3 zinc-binding domains, a RING, unique
B-box type 1 and B-box type 2 domains, followed by a coiled-coil (CC)
region. TRIM proteins use homomultimerization to identify specific cell
compartments.

CLONING

Using a consensus B-box domain to screen dbEST databases, Reymond et al.
(2001) identified 37 TRIM members in mammals, 21 of which were novel, as
well as 34 splice variants. TRIM5 has 6 variants termed alpha, beta,
gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta, all of which lack a B-box type 1
domain. Additional domains C-terminal to the CC region are variably
present. TRIM5-zeta lacks RING, B-box, and CC domains, but possesses 3
RFP-like domains. Northern blot analysis of adult human tissues detected
ubiquitous expression of TRIM5. Using interaction mating and mutation
analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) confirmed that TRIM5, like most TRIMs,
homointeracts through the CC region. Interaction was also detected with
TRIM6 (607564). Green fluorescent protein microscopy demonstrated
expression as cytoplasmic speckles, possibly in novel subcellular
compartments.

Stremlau et al. (2004) determined that human TRIM5-alpha contains 493
amino acids and includes a C-terminal b30.2 (SPRY) domain missing in
other TRIM5 isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

By fluorescence microscopy and mutation analysis, Xu et al. (2003)
showed that TRIM5-delta interacts with BTBD1 (608530) and BTBD2
(608531), apparently serving as a scaffold for the assembly of
endogenous BTBD1/2 proteins, dependent on the presence of the CC region
and a wildtype RING domain. TRIM5-delta exhibits ubiquitylation in the
presence of UBCH5B (UBE2D2; 602962), dependent on the presence of
zinc-coordinating cysteines in the RING domain.

Kaiser et al. (2007) reported the reconstruction of the core protein of
a 4-million-year-old endogenous virus from the chimpanzee genome
(PtERV1) and showed that the human variant of the intrinsic immune
protein TRIM5-alpha can actively prevent infection by this virus.
However, Kaiser et al. (2007) suggested that the selective changes that
have occurred in the human lineage during the acquisition of resistance
to this virus, and perhaps similar viruses, may have left our species
more susceptible to infection by HIV-1.

Pertel et al. (2011) demonstrated that TRIM5 promotes innate immune
signaling and that this activity is amplified by retroviral infection
and interaction with the capsid lattice. Acting with the heterodimeric
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A, TRIM5 catalyzes the synthesis
of unattached K63-linked ubiquitin chains that activate the TAK1
(602614) kinase complex and stimulate AP1 (see 165160) and NF-kappa-B
(see 164011) signaling. Interaction with the HIV-1 capsid lattice
greatly enhanced the UBC13-UEV1A-dependent E3 activity of TRIM5, and
challenge with retroviruses induced the transcription of AP1- and
NF-kappa-B-dependent factors with a magnitude that tracked with TRIM5
avidity for the invading capsid. Finally, TAK1 and UBC13-UEV1A
contributed to capsid-specific restriction by TRIM5. Pertel et al.
(2011) concluded that the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5 has 2
additional activities that are linked to restriction: it constitutively
promotes innate immune signaling, and it acts as a pattern recognition
receptor specific for the retrovirus capsid lattice.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM5
gene to chromosome 11p15, in a cluster with TRIM6, TRIM21 (109092),
TRIM22 (606559), TRIM34 (605684), and a TRIM pseudogene. The authors
noted that, apart from another cluster in the HLA region (chromosome
6p21-23), TRIM genes are dispersed throughout the genome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Stremlau et al. (2004) noted that HIV-1, the cause of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans, efficiently enters the cells
of Old World monkeys but encounters a block before reverse
transcription. The block acts on the HIV-1 capsid and is mediated by a
dominant repressive factor. By screening HeLa cell lines transduced with
a cDNA library from rhesus fibroblasts, Stremlau et al. (2004)
identified HeLa cells expressing rhesus TRIM5-alpha. These cells were
resistant to HIV-1 but not simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)
infection. PCR analysis indicated a disruption of viral cDNA synthesis
in rhesus TRIM5-alpha-expressing cells. Mutation analysis suggested that
both the N-terminal RING and C-terminal SPRY domains of rhesus
TRIM5-alpha contribute to its HIV-1 inhibitory activity. Short
interfering (si) RNA experiments reducing rhesus TRIM5-alpha expression
resulted in increased efficiency of HIV-1 infection. Stremlau et al.
(2004) concluded that monkey TRIM5-alpha is the repressive factor
inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcription and proposed that rhesus
TRIM5-alpha may directly bind and ubiquitinate the HIV-1 viral capsid.

Sayah et al. (2004) showed that knockdown of owl monkey CYPA (123840) by
RNA interference (RNAi) correlated with suppression of anti-HIV-1
activity. However, reintroduction of CYPA to RNAi-treated cells did not
restore antiviral activity. A search for additional RNAi targets
identified TRIMCYP, an RNAi-responsive mRNA encoding a TRIM5/CYPA fusion
protein. TRIMCYP accounts for post-entry restriction of HIV-1 in owl
monkeys and blocks HIV-1 infection when transferred to otherwise
infectable human or rat cells. Sayah et al. (2004) suggested that
TRIMCYP arose after the divergence of New and Old World primates when a
LINE-1 retrotransposon catalyzed the insertion of a CYPA cDNA into the
TRIM5 locus. They concluded that this was the first vertebrate example
of a chimeric gene generated by this mechanism of exon shuffling.

Sakuma et al. (2007) showed that rhesus Trim5-alpha, but not human
TRIM5-alpha, blocked late-phase HIV-1 production through rapid
degradation of HIV-1 Gag polyproteins. In agreement with Sakuma et al.
(2007), Zhang et al. (2008) found that rhesus Trim5-alpha could block
late-stage HIV-1, but not macaque SIV, production. However, the amount
of Trim5-alpha required for this effect was much higher than that
endogenously expressed, and they questioned the biologic significance of
the finding. In a reply, Sakuma et al. (2008) suggested that technical
differences, such as cell lines and capsid sequences, may explain the
need for high Trim5-alpha expression in the experiments of Zhang et al.
(2008).

602327	TITLE *602327 PLECKSTRIN AND SEC7 DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN; PSD
;;TYL;;
EXCHANGE FACTOR FOR ARF6; EFA6;;
EFA6A
DESCRIPTION Perletti et al. (1997) identified a novel human gene on 10q24,
contiguous to the 3-prime end of the NFKB2 gene (164012) in a
tail-to-tail arrangement. They described a cDNA of 4,307 bp, isolated
from an adult human brain cDNA library, which contains an open reading
frame encoding a putative protein of 645 amino acids with a predicted
molecular weight of 71 kD. Database homology searches indicated that the
novel gene codes for a putative protein containing 2 discrete domains
with significant homology to the Sec7 and pleckstrin-homology (PH)
domains, respectively. They used the gene symbol PSD for
'pleckstrin-Sec7 domains.' Northern blot analysis of a panel of RNAs
from normal human tissues using the PSD cDNA as probe revealed the
presence of 3 different tissue-specific transcripts of approximately
4.3, 2.3, and 1.8 kb, the longest of which was expressed only in brain.
The data suggested that the PSD gene may encode a protein related to the
protein family containing both the Sec7 in the PH domains and thought to
be involved in signaling transduction processes. Other human proteins in
the same family include cytohesin-1 (Kolanus et al., 1996) and ARNO
(602488) (Chardin et al., 1996).

Derrien et al. (2002) reported that PSD, which they called EFA6A, is 63%
identical to EFA6B (PSD4; 614442) and contains a Sec7 domain adjacent to
a PH domain, followed by a C-terminal coiled-coil motif. Northern blot
analysis showed that EFA6A expression was largely restricted to brain,
with a smaller transcript expressed in small intestine, colon, and
ovary. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated punctate cell surface
expression of ARF6 (600464) and EFA6A, like EFA6B, in transfected baby
hamster kidney cells. Both EFA6 proteins also colocalized with F-actin
(see 102610).

GENE FUNCTION

Derrien et al. (2002) found that recombinant EFA6A stimulated nucleotide
exchange on myristoylated ARF6, with only low activity on ARF1 (103180).
The C-terminal region was involved in microvilli lengthening. Derrien et
al. (2002) concluded that EFA6 family guanine exchange factors are
modular proteins that work through the coordinated action of the
catalytic Sec7 domain to promote ARF6 activation, through the PH domain
to regulate association with specific subdomains of the plasma membrane,
and through the C-terminal region to control actin cytoskeletal
reorganization.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the PSD gene to chromosome 10q24.32 based on an
alignment of the PSD sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC142689) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

612167	TITLE *612167 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 48; WDR48
;;p80;;
KIAA1449;;
USP1-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 1; UAF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned WDR48, which they called KIAA1449.
The predicted 607-amino acid protein shares 43% identity with a 77-kD
worm protein containing trp-asp (WD) repeats. RT-PCR ELISA detected high
expression in testis and ovary and moderate expression in all other
adult and fetal tissues examined. Within brain, expression was high in
corpus callosum, caudate nucleus, and subthalamic nucleus and moderate
in all other regions examined.

By screening for T-lymphocyte proteins that could bind to the
herpesvirus saimiri Tip protein, followed by immunoblot analysis, mass
spectrometry, and PCR of a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library, Park et al.
(2002) cloned full-length WDR48, which they called p80. The deduced
677-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 76.2 kD. It
contains 8 potential N-terminal WD repeats and a C-terminal coiled-coil
structure. Northern blot analysis detected a major 4.2-kb transcript and
a minor 3.0-kb transcript in all tissues examined. Expression of the
major transcript was somewhat higher in skeletal muscle, kidney, and
placenta compared with other tissues. WDR48 had an apparent molecular
mass of 80 kD by SDS-PAGE. Immunofluorescence analysis localized to
WDR48 to late endosomes and lysosomes of Jurkat T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation analysis, Park et
al. (2002) showed that the N terminus of WDR48 interacted with the
N-terminal ser-rich portion of Tip, while the WDR48 C terminus mediated
lysosomal localization. Interaction of Tip with WDR48 induced lysosomal
vesicle formation and, via the C-terminal region of Tip, recruitment of
LCK (153390) to these lysosomal vesicles for degradation. Tip
interactions with WDR48 and LCK resulted in downregulation of T-cell
receptor (see 186830) and CD4 (186940) surface expression, respectively,
leading to inhibition of T-lymphocyte signal transduction.

Using tandem affinity protein purification coupled to mass spectrometry,
Cote-Martin et al. (2008) showed that anogenital, but not cutaneous,
strains of human papillomavirus E1 helicase interacted with WDR48.
Colocalization analysis revealed that E1 redistributed WDR48 from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus in a manner dependent on the E1 nuclear
localization signal. Cote-Martin et al. (2008) proposed that E1
interaction with WDR48 is required for efficient maintenance of the
viral episome in undifferentiated keratinocytes.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the KIAA1449 gene to
chromosome 3.

603219	TITLE *603219 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY K, MEMBER 2; KCNK2
;;TWIK-RELATED K+ CHANNEL; TREK;;
TREK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TREK1 is a 2-pore-domain background potassium channel expressed
throughout the central nervous system. It is opened by polyunsaturated
fatty acids, lysophospholipids, and volatile anesthetics, and it is
inhibited by neurotransmitters that increase intracellular cAMP or
activate the Gq (600998) signaling pathway (Heurteaux et al., 2004).

CLONING

Potassium channels are ubiquitous multisubunit membrane proteins that
regulate membrane potential in numerous cell types. One family of
mammalian K+ channels is characterized by the presence of 4
transmembrane domains and 2 P (pore) domains per subunit; this family
includes TWIK (KCNK1; 601745) and TASK (KCNK3; 603220). Fink et al.
(1996) used degenerate PCR with primers based on the sequence of TWIK to
clone a novel member of this family, Trek, from a mouse brain cDNA
library. The Trek cDNA encodes a 370-amino acid polypeptide. Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues demonstrated Trek expression at highest
levels in brain and lung and at lower levels in several other tissues.
In situ hybridization of mouse brain revealed that its expression is
widespread.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to mouse Trek1,
followed by PCR, 3-prime RACE, and 5-prime RACE of fetal brain and
adrenal gland cDNA libraries, Meadows et al. (2000) cloned human TREK1.
The deduced 411-amino acid protein contains 4 transmembrane helices and
2 pore helices with the associated GFG tripeptide signature sequence.
The C terminus contains 7 consensus phosphorylation sites. Meadows et
al. (2000) recloned the 3-prime end of mouse Trek1 and obtained a
sequence encoding a 411-amino acid protein 96% identical to human TREK1.
Northern blot analysis of several human tissues detected a 3.8-kb
transcript only in brain. RT-PCR detected variable expression of TREK1
in all central nervous tissue examined. Expression was highest in
caudate nucleus, putamen, amygdala, thalamus, and spinal cord, and it
was higher in fetal brain than in whole adult brain. Expression in
peripheral tissues was much lower, with highest levels in stomach and
small intestine.

GENE FUNCTION

Fink et al. (1996) found that K+ currents generated by expressed mouse
Trek were outwardly rectifying, sensitive to extracellular K+ and Na+,
and insensitive to pharmacologic agents that block TWIK.

Patel et al. (1998) found that mouse Trek1 expressed in COS cells or in
Xenopus oocytes was responsive to cAMP, serotonin, arachidonic acid,
chloroform, membrane stretch, change in cell shape, and osmolarity. The
C-terminal region of Trek1 was necessary but not sufficient to provide
mechanical and chemical sensitivities. Trek1 truncation mutants lacking
2 C-terminal protein kinase A (see 176911) consensus phosphorylation
sites were insensitive to cAMP and serotonin, suggesting that
phosphorylation may be involved in downmodulation of Trek1 by cAMP.

Meadows et al. (2000) found that expression of TREK1 in Xenopus oocytes
produced a hyperpolarizing shift in the resting membrane potential
accompanied by induction of a large, outwardly rectifying,
noninactivating potassium current. TREK1-mediated currents were weakly
reduced by classic potassium channel blockers or open channel pore
blockers. Channel activity was reversibly potentiated by arachidonic
acid.

MAPPING

Lesage and Lazdunski (1998) used a radiation hybrid mapping panel to map
the human KCNK2 gene to chromosome 1q41 between markers WI5105 and
WI4396.

ANIMAL MODEL

Heurteaux et al. (2004) found that Trek1-null mice were born at expected
mendelian ratios, were healthy and fertile, and showed no morphologic
defects. Brain morphology, behavior, posture, locomotor activity, and
reflexes appeared normal in Trek1-null mice. However, Trek1-null animals
were more sensitive to ischemia and epilepsy than wildtype mice.
Neuroprotection by polyunsaturated fatty acids, which was strong in
wildtype animals, disappeared in Trek1-null mice. Trek1-null mice were
also resistant to anesthesia by volatile anesthetics. Heurteaux et al.
(2004) concluded that TREK1 plays a major role in the neuroprotection
against epilepsy and ischemia afforded by polyunsaturated fatty acids
and lysophospholipids, and in anesthesia induced by volatile
anesthetics.

In rodents, Blondeau et al. (2007) demonstrated that polyunsaturated
fatty acids, particularly alpha-linolenic acid, increased cerebral blood
flow and vasodilation of the basilar artery but not the carotid artery.
Vasodilation was independent of nitric oxide and prostanoids. Trek1 mRNA
was detected in myocytes and endothelial cells of the basilar artery but
not in carotid or femoral arteries. Polyunsaturated-induced vasodilation
of the basilar artery was abolished in Trek1-null mice. Blondeau et al.
(2007) suggested that the increased capacity of certain cerebral
arteries to dilate after treatment with polyunsaturated fatty acids via
the TREK1 channel increases collateral flow and thus may provide
residual cerebral circulation during ischemic stroke.

173880	TITLE *173880 POLYMERIC IMMUNOGLOBULIN RECEPTOR; PIGR
;;POLY-Ig RECEPTOR;;
TRANSMEMBRANE SECRETORY COMPONENT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The poly-Ig receptor is expressed on several glandular epithelia
including those of liver and breast. It mediates transcellular transport
of polymeric immunoglobulin molecules. It is a member of the
immunoglobulin superfamily (Hood et al., 1985). The receptor has 5 units
with homology to the variable (V) units of immunoglobulins and a
transmembrane region, which also has some homology to certain
immunoglobulin variable regions.

CLONING

Davidson et al. (1988) cloned the human PIGR gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krajci et al. (1992) identified 11 exons covering the entire PIGR coding
region.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2000) reported that human PIGR can bind to a major
pneumococcal adhesin, CbpA. Expression of PIGR in human nasopharyngeal
cells and MDCK cells greatly enhanced pneumococcal adherence and
invasion. The PIGR-mediated bacterial adherence and invasion were
abolished by either insertional knockout of CbpA or antibodies against
either PIGR or CbpA. These results suggested that pneumococci are a
novel example of a pathogen coopting the PIG transcytosis machinery to
promote translocation across a mucosal barrier.

PIGR binds its ligand, dimeric IgA (dIgA; see 146900), at the
basolateral surface of epithelial cells. After endocytosis, the
PIGR-dIgA complex traverses several endosomal compartments and is
exocytosed at the apical plasma membrane. Van IJzendoorn et al. (2002)
found that Rab3b (179510) localized to vesicular structures containing
Pigr in canine kidney cells and that GTP-bound Rab3b interacted directly
with the cytoplasmic domain of Pigr. Binding of dIgA to Pigr dissociated
Rab3b, but a constitutively active Rab3b mutant maintained its
interaction with Pigr in dIgA-treated cells. Furthermore, GTP-locked
Rab3b inhibited dIgA-stimulated transcytosis.

MAPPING

Davidson et al. (1988) localized the PIGR gene to 1q31-q41 by a
combination of somatic cell hybridization and in situ hybridization. By
Southern blot analysis of human/rodent somatic hybrid panels, including
hybrids with translocation chromosomes carrying different parts of
chromosome 1, Krajci et al. (1991) confirmed the assignment of PIGR to
1q31-q42. Krajci et al. (1992) found linkage evidence supporting the
location of PIGR in this region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Obara et al. (2003) performed a case-control association study involving
389 Japanese patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN; 161950)
and 465 controls. A significant association was found between IgAN and 6
SNPs in the PIGR gene. One of the SNPs, PIGR17, caused an amino acid
substitution from alanine to valine at codon 580. Another SNP, PIGR2,
may affect promoter activity. Pairwise analyses demonstrated that all 6
SNPs were in almost complete linkage disequilibrium. Biopsy specimens
from IgAN patients were positively stained by antibody against the
secretory component of PIGR, but corresponding tissues from non-IgAN
patients were not.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
PIGR, ALA580VAL

This variant, formerly titled IgA NEPHROPATHY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, has
been reclassified based on the findings of Maxwell and Wang (2006).

In a case-control association study involving 389 Japanese patients with
immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IGAN; 161950) and 465 controls, Obara et
al. (2003) found an association between an SNP, designated PIGR17, and
IGAN. The PIGR17 SNP consists of a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1740
in exon 7, which results in an ala-to-val amino acid substitution at
codon 580 (A580V). The odds ratio of homozygotes for the minor allele
(T) compared to CC or CT genotypes was 2.71.

Maxwell and Wang (2006) included the PIGR variant reported by Obara et
al. (2003) in a table of genetic associations with IgA nephropathy,
noting that although plausible, these genetic associations had not
generally been observed in more than 1 study and could not be proved to
contribute to IgA nephropathy causation or progression.

603977	TITLE *603977 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 208; ZNF208
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 95; ZNF95
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs), such as ZNF208, bind DNA and, through this
binding, regulate gene transcription. Most ZNFs contain conserved C2H2
motifs and are classified as Kruppel-type zinc fingers. A conserved
protein motif, termed the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, mediates
protein-protein interactions (Eichler et al., 1998). See ZNF91 (603971)
for further information on ZNFs.

CLONING

Using probes derived from a ZNF91 cDNA to screen a pool of human
chromosome 19-specific cosmids that had hybridized to a degenerate
oligonucleotide corresponding to the H/C link region, Bellefroid et al.
(1993) isolated the genes of several distinct ZNF91 subfamily members,
including ZNF208, which they called ZNF95. They found that ZNF91-related
genes were widely expressed in human tissues, with highest expression in
T-lymphoid cells.

Using a combined approach of FISH, STS markers, and conversion of
overlapping sets of YAC genomic clones, Eichler et al. (1998) identified
and cloned ZNF208. The full-length transcript predicts a 1,317-amino
acid protein consisting of 2 KRAB protein-interacting domains and 41 ZNF
(28-amino acid) repeats. A splice variant, resulting from the use of an
alternative polyadenylation signal, predicts a 77-amino acid peptide
consisting only of the KRAB protein-interacting domains. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of both transcripts in all tissues
examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eichler et al. (1998) determined that the ZNF208 gene contains 3 exons,
1 for each KRAB domain and a single large exon that incorporates the ZNF
DNA-binding domain.

MAPPING

By FISH, Bellefroid et al. (1993) mapped a YAC clone containing the
ZNF208 gene to chromosome 19p13.1-p12. By sequence analysis, Eichler et
al. (1998) mapped the ZNF208 gene within a cluster of ZNF genes on
chromosome 19p12.

604138	TITLE *604138 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR, FAMILY C, GROUP 5, MEMBER A; GPRC5A
;;RETINOIC ACID-INDUCED 3; RAI3;;
RETINOIC ACID-INDUCIBLE GENE 1; RAIG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large superfamily of
proteins that transmit signals from extracellular messenger molecules
and sensory stimuli to intracellular signaling pathways. GPRC5A belongs
to the glutamate receptor subfamily of GPCRs (Bjarnadottir et al.,
2005).

CLONING

Retinoids affect many fundamental cellular processes, including
embryogenesis, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and they
exert significant preventive and therapeutic effects against human
cancer. Using differential display to identify retinoic acid-regulated
genes from a human oral squamous carcinoma cell line, Cheng and Lotan
(1998) isolated a cDNA corresponding to a novel retinoic acid-induced
gene, which they named RAIG1. RAIG1 expression was induced by
all-trans-retinoic acid rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner. The
levels of RAIG1 mRNA in different cancer cells varied greatly, with no
correlation between the expression levels and the type of cancer cells.
RAIG1 was expressed in several normal human tissues, with highest
expression levels in fetal and adult lung. Northern blot analysis
detected RAIG1 transcripts of 2.4 and 6.8 kb; the authors stated that
these likely result from the alternative use of different
polyadenylation sites. RAIG1 encodes a deduced 357-amino acid protein
with a calculated molecular mass of 40,256 Da. It contains 7 predicted
transmembrane domains, which is a signature motif of the GPCR
superfamily, and a potential N-linked glycosylation site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) determined that the GPRC5A gene contains 3
exons.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid and YAC contig mapping, Cheng and Lotan (1998)
localized the GPRC5A gene to chromosome 12p13-p12.3, between markers
D12S358 and D12S847.

By genomic sequence analysis, Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) mapped the
GPRC5A gene to chromosome 12p13.1. They mapped the mouse Gprc5a gene to
chromosome 6.

609501	TITLE *609501 TUDOR AND KH DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN; TDRKH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to ICLN (CLNS1A; 602158),
followed by PCR and screening of a human aorta cDNA library, Lamb et al.
(2000) obtained several TDRKH variants. The variants differ in their
3-prime ends due to alternative splicing or use of alternative
polyadenylation signals. No TDRKH variant shows similarity to ICLN, but
an intronic sequence of TDRKH appears to contain an ICLN pseudogene. The
longest deduced TDRKH protein contains 606 amino acids and has 2 KH
domains and 1 tudor domain. Both KH and tudor domains are involved in
binding RNA or single-strand DNA. TDRKH splice variants encode shorter
proteins that contain only the first KH domain, both KH domains without
the tudor domain, or only the first KH domain with the tudor domain.
Northern blot analysis detected major TDRKH transcripts of about 4.0 and
2.8 kb and minor transcripts of about 4.8, 2.3, and 1.8 kb. Expression
was highest in brain and heart, intermediate in kidney, lung, and small
intestine, and low in muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lamb et al. (2000) determined that the TDRKH gene contains 3
alternatively spliced exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Lamb et al. (2000)
mapped the TDRKH gene to the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on
chromosome 1q21. The EDC contains a large cluster of related genes
involved in terminal differentiation of the epidermis.

600525	TITLE *600525 DISTAL-LESS HOMEOBOX 3; DLX3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Distal-less family of genes, including DLX3, comprises at least 6
different members sharing a homeobox sequence similar to that found in
the Drosophila Distal-less (Dll) gene.

CLONING

Price et al. (1998) cloned and sequenced the DLX3 gene. The deduced
288-amino acid protein contains a homeobox in its C- terminal region.
Human DLX3 shares 98% identity with mouse Dlx3, and the homeodomain of
human DLX3 shares 100% identity with the homeodomains of mouse, Mexican
salamander (axolotl), newt, zebrafish and Xenopus Dlx3. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.5-kb transcript in human placenta.

GENE STRUCTURE

Price et al. (1998) determined that the DLX3 gene contains 3 coding
exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Hassan et al. (2004) found that Msx2 (123101), Dlx3, Dlx5 (600028), and
Runx2 (600211) regulated the expression of osteocalcin (OC) (BGLAP;
112260) in mouse embryos and therefore are implicated in the control of
bone formation. Msx2 associated with transcriptionally repressed OC
chromatin, and Dlx3 and Dlx5 were recruited with Runx2 to initiate OC
transcription. In a second regulatory switch, Dlx3 association decreased
and Dlx5 recruitment increased coincident with the mineralization stage
of osteoblast differentiation. The appearance of Dlx3 followed by Dlx5
in the OC promoter correlated with increased transcription represented
by increased occupancy of RNA polymerase II.

MAPPING

Using a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel and FISH, Scherer et al.
(1995) mapped the human DLX3 gene to chromosome 17q21.3-q22. Nakamura et
al. (1996) found that human DLX3 and DLX4 (601911) are 10 kb apart on
chromosome 17. DLX3 is in the same general region as the HOX2 cluster of
genes (e.g., HOX2A; 142960), whereas DLX1 and DLX2 are syntenic to the
HOX4 cluster (e.g., HOX4A; 142980) on chromosome 2, and the DLX5 and
DLX6 loci are near the HOX1 cluster (e.g., HOX1A; 142950) on 7q. These
observations offered another piece of evidence for paralogy between
human chromosomes 2, 7, and 17.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Price et al. (1998) noted that trichodentoosseous syndrome (TDO; 190320)
maps to chromosome 17q21, a region that includes 2 members of the
distal-less homeobox gene family, DLX3 and DLX7 (also known as DLX4;
601911). They identified a 4-bp deletion (600525.0001) in the DLX3 gene
that correlated with the TDO phenotype in 6 families.

Amelogenesis imperfecta, hypomaturation-hypoplastic type, with
taurodontism (AI4; 104510) is an autosomal dominant trait associated
with enamel defects and enlarged pulp chambers. Dong et al. (2005)
studied a family with transmission of this disorder through 3
generations with 11 affected individuals in 5 sibships and 1 instance of
male-to-male transmission. Linkage analysis mapped the phenotype to
chromosome 17q21-q22 (lod score = 3.3), and mutation analysis identified
a 2-bp deletion in the DLX3 gene associated with the disorder (560delCT;
600525.0002). This was the first report of a mutation within the
homeodomain of DLX3; the 4-bp deletion in DLX3 associated with TDO is
situated outside the homeodomain. Dong et al. (2005) concluded that TDO
and some forms of AIHHT are allelic.

Wright et al. (2008) analyzed the DLX3 gene in a 3-generation family
with an attenuated TDO phenotype and identified heterozygosity for the
560delCT mutation in all affected individuals. Noting that affected
individuals in this kindred had changes in hair, tooth, and bone,
although to a lesser degree than individuals with the 4-bp deletion
(600525.0001), the authors concluded that this mutation causes TDO with
an attenuated phenotype, not AIHHT, as previously reported.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morasso et al. (1999) found that the targeted deletion of the mouse Dlx3
gene resulted in embryonic death between day 9.5 and day 10 because of
placental defects that altered the development of the labyrinthine
layer. In situ hybridization showed that the Dlx3 gene is initially
expressed in ectoplacental cone cells and chorionic plate, and later in
the labyrinthine trophoblast of the chorioallantoic placenta, where
major defects are observed in the Dlx3 -/- embryos. They found that by
day 10.5 of development, expression of the paired-like homeodomain gene
Esx1 was strongly downregulated in affected placenta tissue, suggesting
that Dlx3 is required for the maintenance of Esx1 expression, normal
placental morphogenesis, and embryonic survival.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TRICHODENTOOSSEOUS SYNDROME
DLX3, 4-BP DEL, NT3198

In all affected members of 6 trichodentoosseous syndrome (TDO; 190320)
pedigrees, Price et al. (1998) found deletion of 4 G nucleotides
beginning at nucleotide 3198 in 1 allele of the DLX3 gene. The deletion
resulted in the frameshift of the 3-prime terminal portion of DLX3 but
left the homeodomain intact. An in-frame termination codon was present
in the deletion allele at nucleotide 3398; this resulted in a mutant
protein that was 32 amino acids shorter than the normal DLX3 protein.
The most penetrant clinical findings in TDO patients are taurodontism
and enamel defects in teeth. In early murine tooth formation, Dlx3 is
expressed primarily in the neural crest-derived mesenchymal component of
the tooth that will later give rise to the dentin and pulp. The whisker
and hair follicles of mice strongly express Dlx3 before birth, followed
by a decrease in expression after birth. This could correlate with the
kinky, curly hair observed in TDO patients at birth, that in over half
the cases straightens during infancy. The osseous cranial changes in TDO
patients are more difficult to understand than the hair and tooth
anomalies, but murine Dlx3 expression has been detected in the dense
mesenchyme of the branchial arches, which subsequently condenses and
ossifies to form the bones of the skull and face.

Price et al. (1998) identified the same 4-bp deletion in a Virginia
family. A common haplotype for 3 markers surrounding the DLX3 gene was
identified in all affected subjects in the 6 original families and the
Virginia family. Price et al. (1998) concluded that all affected
individuals in these families had inherited the same DLX3 gene deletion
from a common ancestor.

.0002
AMELOGENESIS IMPERFECTA, TYPE IV
TRICHODENTOOSSEOUS SYNDROME, INCLUDED
DLX3, 2-BP DEL, 560CT

In affected members of a 3-generation family with amelogenesis
imperfecta, hypomaturation-hypoplastic type, with taurodontism (AI4;
104510) in an autosomal dominant pedigree pattern, Dong et al. (2005)
identified a 2-bp deletion in the DLX3 gene, 560delCT, resulting in a
frameshift that altered the last 2 amino acids of the DNA-binding
homeodomain and introduced a premature stop codon that truncated the
protein by 88 amino acids.

In 7 affected members of a 3-generation family with an attenuated TDO
phenotype, Wright et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for the
560delCT mutation in the DLX3 gene. The mutation was not found in 5
unaffected family members. Noting that affected individuals in this
kindred had changes in hair similar to those of individuals with the
4-bp deletion (600525.0001), as well as tooth and bone changes although
to a lesser degree, the authors concluded that this mutation causes TDO
with an attenuated phenotype, not AIHHT, as previously reported.

;;GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRATE TRANSAMINASE; GABAT;;
GABA-TRANSFERASE;;
GABA-TRANSAMINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ABAT gene encodes gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.19),
which catalyzes the conversion of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an
important, mostly inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous
system, into succinic semialdehyde (Osei and Churchich, 1995).

CLONING

Osei and Churchich (1995) used a probe from the pig GABAT cDNA to screen
a human brain cDNA library. They identified a human GABAT cDNA, which
encodes a deduced 500-amino acid protein that is over 95% similar to the
pig protein. The active enzyme is a homodimer of 50-kD subunits
complexed to pyridoxal-5-phosphate. GABAT is present in several tissues
in addition to brain and is most active in liver.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ABAT
gene to chromosome 16p13.3 (TMAP RH69040).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Jeremiah and Povey (1981) suggested that GABAT in liver and brain is
controlled by 2 codominant alleles with a frequency in a Caucasian
population of 0.56 and 0.44. A 3-banded pattern in heterozygotes
suggested that GABAT is a dimeric protein. Bhattacharyya et al. (1985)
gave gene frequencies for Chinese, Indians, and Malays living in
Singapore and described a new allele.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

- GABA-Transaminase Deficiency

In a patient with GABA-transaminase deficiency (613163) reported by
Jaeken et al. (1984), Medina-Kauwe et al. (1999) identified a mutation
in the ABAT gene (R220K; 137150.0001). The second allele in the patient
remained unidentified. A second unrelated patient had a deletion in the
ABAT gene (137150.0002). Both patients had severe psychomotor
retardation, seizures, hypotonia, and hyperreflexia and died before age
2 years.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GABA-TRANSAMINASE DEFICIENCY
ABAT, ARG220LYS

In a patient with GABA-transaminase deficiency (613163) reported by
Jaeken et al. (1984), Medina-Kauwe et al. (1999) identified a 754A-G
transition in the ABAT gene, resulting in an arg220-to-lys (R220K)
substitution in a highly conserved residue. Expression of the mutant in
E. coli, followed by isolation and enzymatic characterization of the
recombinant protein, revealed an enzyme whose Vmax was reduced to 25% of
wildtype activity. The second allele in the patient remained
unidentified.

;;ERK2-BINDING TESTICULAR PROTEIN 1; EBITEIN1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Erk2 (MAPK1; 176948) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
mouse brain cDNA library, Miura and Imaki (2008) cloned Micalcl, which
they called Ebitein1. The deduced 680-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 75 kD. Northern blot analysis detected
Ebitein1 expression in mouse testis, but not in 12 other mouse tissues
examined, including brain. Western blot analysis detected Ebitein1 at an
apparent molecular mass of 75 kD in testis only. Immunohistochemical
analysis showed high Ebitein1 expression in round spermatids, but not in
other testicular cells. During spermatogenesis, Ebitein1 first appeared
after meiosis when cells became haploid, then the amount of Ebitein1
gradually increased, reaching a maximum at Oakberg stage 9.
Subsequently, the level of Ebitein1 decreased such that it was
undetectable when the flagellum of the spermatozoon was generated. On a
subcellular level, Ebitein1 localized in the cytoplasm.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MICALCL gene to chromosome 11p15.3 based on an
alignment of the MICALCL sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK123671) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

expressed in all rat tissues tested.

LeBoeuf et al. (1998) also cloned the human suppressin cDNA sequence,

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A major mechanism for the regulation of prostaglandin synthesis occurs
at the level of cyclooxygenase, also known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide
synthase (PTGS; EC 1.14.99.1). The first rate-limiting step in the
conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins is catalyzed by PTGS.
Two isoforms of PTGS have been identified: PTGS1 (COX1; 176805) and a
mitogen-inducible form, PTGS2. PTGS1 is involved in production of
prostaglandins for cellular housekeeping functions, whereas PTGS2 is
associated with biologic events such as injury, inflammation, and
proliferation (summary by Hla and Neilson (1992) and Tazawa et al.
(1994)).

CLONING

The antiinflammatory glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of
cyclooxygenase, a key regulator of prostaglandin synthesis. To
investigate the mechanism of this inhibition, O'Banion et al. (1991,
1992) cloned a 4.1-kb mouse cDNA that conferred cyclooxygenase activity
to transfected cells. The mRNA of this cyclooxygenase, which O'Banion et
al. (1991, 1992) called Gripghs, was unique for its long 3-prime
untranslated region containing many AUUUA repeats. The 4.1-kb GRIPGHS
mRNA was rapidly increased by serum or interleukin-1-beta (IL1B; 147720)
in mouse fibroblasts and human monocytes, respectively, and decreased by
glucocorticoids, whereas levels of the 2.8-kb cyclooxygenase mRNA did
not change. O'Banion et al. (1991, 1992) concluded that the 2.8-kb
cyclooxygenase (PGHS1) is constitutive, whereas the 4.1-kb GRIPGHS is
regulated and is probably a major mediator of inflammation.

Hla and Neilson (1992) cloned COX2 from a human umbilical vein
endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library. The deduced 604-amino acid
protein is 61% identical to human COX1 and 88% identical to mouse Cox2.
COX2 contains an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a central
transmembrane region, a conserved active-site tyrosine, a conserved
aspirin acetylation site, and a C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum
retention signal. It also has several N-glycosylation sites, some of
which are conserved with COX1. In vitro translation of COX2 resulted in
a 70-kD protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb COX2
transcript in HUVECs. RT-PCR analysis revealed expression of COX2 and
COX1 in HUVECs, vascular smooth muscle cells, monocytes, and
fibroblasts.

Macchia et al. (1997) detected PGHS2 mRNA by Northern blot analysis of
term placenta. Western blot analysis using 3 highly specific antibodies
also found selective expression of PGHS2 immunoreactive protein in term
placenta. No PGHS1 was found in placenta.

Kirschenbaum et al. (2000) studied the immunohistochemical localization
of PTGS1 and PTGS2 in the human male fetal and adult reproductive
tracts. There was no PTGS1 expression in fetal samples (prostate,
seminal vesicles, or ejaculatory ducts), and only minimal expression in
adult tissues. There was no expression of PTGS2 in the fetal prostate.
In a prepubertal prostate there was some PTGS2 expression that localized
exclusively to the smooth muscle cells of the transition zone. In adult
hyperplastic prostates, PTGS2 was strongly expressed in smooth muscle
cells, with no expression in the luminal epithelial cells. PTGS2 was
strongly expressed in epithelial cells of both fetal and adult seminal
vesicles and ejaculatory ducts. The PTGS2 staining intensity in the
fetal ejaculatory ducts during various times of gestation correlated
with previously reported testosterone production rates by the fetal
testis. The authors concluded that PTGS2 is the predominant isoform
expressed in the fetal male reproductive tract, and its expression may
be regulated by androgens.

GENE FUNCTION

Hla and Neilson (1992) found that expression of human COX2 in COS-7
cells produced cyclooxygenase activity. COX2 mRNA was preferentially
induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) in human endothelial cells and monocytes. This induction could be
partially inhibited by pretreatment with dexamethasone. In contrast,
COX1 showed minimal induction with LPS and PMA. Hla and Neilson (1992)
concluded that high-level induction of COX2 in mesenchymal-derived
inflammatory cells suggests a role for COX2 in inflammatory conditions.

Jones et al. (1993) found that stimulation of endothelial cells with TNF
(191160), PMA, LPS, or IL1 increased mRNA levels of PHS II, and this
change correlated with increased prostacyclin biosynthesis.
Cyclohexamide induced PHS II mRNA without a corresponding activity
increase, demonstrating that translation is required for enhanced
prostacyclin biosynthesis. Jones et al. (1993) concluded that expression
of PHS II may have important pathophysiologic effects in vasculature.

Tsujii and DuBois (1995) studied the effects of overexpressing COX2. Rat
intestinal epithelial (RIE) cells were stably transfected with a COX2
expression vector oriented in the sense (RIE-S) or antisense (RIE-AS)
direction. The RIE-S cells expressed elevated COX2 protein levels and
demonstrated increased adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins.
E-cadherin (192090) was undetectable in RIE-S cells, but was elevated in
parental RIE and RIE-AS cells. RIE-S cells were resistant to
butyrate-induced apoptosis, had elevated BCL2 (151430) protein
expression, and showed reduced transforming growth factor beta-2
receptor levels. The phenotypic changes involving both increased
adhesion to extracellular matrix and inhibition of apoptosis were
reversed by sulindac sulfide, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. These studies
demonstrated that overexpression of COX2 leads to phenotypic changes in
intestinal epithelial cells that could enhance their tumorigenic
potential.

To explore the role of cyclooxygenase in endothelial cell migration and
angiogenesis, Tsujii et al. (1998) used 2 in vitro model systems
involving coculture of endothelial cells with colon carcinoma cells.
Cells overexpressing COX2 produced prostaglandins and proangiogenic
factors, and stimulated both endothelial migration and tube formation,
whereas control cells had little activity. The effect was inhibited by
antibodies to combinations of angiogenic factors, by NS-398 (a selective
COX2 inhibitor), and by aspirin. NS-398 did not inhibit production of
angiogenic factors or angiogenesis induced by COX2-negative cells.
Tsujii et al. (1998) also found that COX2 can modulate production of
angiogenic factors by colon cancer cells.

Zhou et al. (1999) found that culturing cells with highly purified human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) resulted in a time- and dose-dependent
increase in steady state levels of COX2 mRNA and protein and the
secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Although human luteinizing hormone
(LH; see 152780) could mimic hCG, follicle-stimulating hormone (see
136530), thyroid-stimulating hormone (see 188540), and the alpha (CGA;
118850) and beta (CGB; 118860) subunits of hCG had no effect on COX2
protein levels. The authors concluded that hCG and LH treatment can
increase expression of COX2 in human endometrial gland epithelial cells;
the effect is time and dose dependent, hormone specific, and mediated by
the cAMP/type I protein kinase A signaling pathway; the hCG actions
require a normal complement of its receptors in cells; and these hCG and
LH effects may be another action of these hormones in human endometrium
that is important for implantation of the blastocyst and continuation of
pregnancy.

In a randomized control study comparing the effect of COX2 inhibitors
with nonselective NSAIDS upon the renal function of elderly subjects,
Swan et al. (2000) found that both agents cause a significant decrease
in the glomerular filtration rate. They concluded that COX2 therefore
seems to play an important role in human renal function.

Erkinheimo et al. (2000) investigated the expression of COX2 in human
myometrium. Myometrial samples collected from women in labor during
lower segment cesarean section expressed 15-fold higher levels of COX2
mRNA compared to myometrial specimens collected from women not in labor,
as detected by Northern blot analysis. Immunohistochemical detection of
COX2 protein showed cytoplasmic staining in the smooth muscle cells of
the myometrium. Cultured myometrial cells expressed low levels of COX2
mRNA under baseline conditions, but IL1-beta caused a 17-fold induction
of expression of the PTGS2 transcript after incubation for 6 hours.
IL1-beta also induced expression of biologically active COX2 protein, as
detected by immunofluorescence, Western blot analysis, and measuring the
conversion of arachidonic acid to prostanoids in the presence and
absence of a COX2-selective inhibitor, NS-398. PGE2 receptor subtype EP2
(176804) mRNA was expressed in cultured myometrial smooth muscle cells,
whereas transcripts for EP1 (176802), EP3 (176806), EP4 (601586), FP
(601204), and IP (600022) were low or below the detection limit as
measured by Northern blot analysis. However, IL1-beta stimulated
expression of EP4 receptor mRNA. The authors concluded that expression
of COX2 transcript is elevated at the onset of labor in myometrial
smooth muscle cells. This increase in expression may depend on
cytokines. As, in addition to COX2, the expression of prostanoid
receptors is regulated, not only the production of prostanoids, but also
responsiveness to them, may be modulated.

Inflammation causes the induction of COX2, leading to the release of
prostanoids, which sensitize peripheral nociceptor terminals and produce
localized pain hypersensitivity. Peripheral inflammation also generates
pain hypersensitivity in neighboring uninjured tissue, because of the
increased neuronal excitability in the spinal cord, and a syndrome
comprising diffuse muscle and joint pain, fever, lethargy, and anorexia.
Samad et al. (2001) showed that COX2 may be involved in central nervous
system (CNS) responses, by finding a widespread induction of COX2
expression in spinal cord neurons and in other regions of the CNS,
elevating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. The
major inducer of central COX2 upregulation is IL1-beta in the CNS, and
as basal phospholipase A2 (see 600522) activity in the CNS does not
change with peripheral inflammation, COX2 levels must regulate central
prostanoid production. In the rat, intraspinal administration of an
interleukin-converting enzyme or COX2 inhibitor decreased
inflammation-induced central PGE2 levels and mechanical hyperalgesia.
Thus, Samad et al. (2001) concluded that preventing central prostanoid
production by inhibiting the IL1-beta-mediated induction of COX2 in
neurons or by inhibiting central COX2 activity reduces centrally
generated inflammatory pain hypersensitivity.

Epithelial tumors may be regulated by COX enzyme products. To determine
if COX2 expression and PGE2 synthesis are upregulated in cervical
cancers, Sales et al. (2001) used real-time quantitative PCR and Western
blot analysis to confirm COX2 RNA and protein expression in squamous
cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. In contrast, minimal expression of
COX2 was detected in histologically normal cervix. Immunohistochemical
analyses localized COX2 expression and PGE2 synthesis to neoplastic
epithelial cells of all squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas
studied. Immunoreactive COX2 and PGE2 were also colocalized to
endothelial cells lining the microvasculature. To establish whether PGE2
has an autocrine/paracrine effect in cervical carcinomas, the authors
investigated the expression of 2 subtypes of PGE2 receptors, namely EP2
and EP4 by real-time quantitative PCR. Expression of EP2 and EP4
receptors was significantly higher in carcinoma tissue than in
histologically normal cervix. The authors concluded that COX2, EP2, and
EP4 expression and PGE2 synthesis are upregulated in cervical cancer
tissue and that PGE2 may regulate neoplastic cell function in cervical
carcinoma in an autocrine/paracrine manner via the EP2/EP4 receptors.

Lassus et al. (2000) performed COX2 immunohistochemistry on lung tissues
from autopsies of fetuses (16 to 32 weeks), preterm infants, term
infants, and infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). COX2
staining was found exclusively in the epithelial cells resembling type
II pneumocytes in the alveoli, and in ciliated epithelial cells in the
bronchi. COX2 staining occurred in a changing pattern: moderate
intensity staining in 90 to 100% of cells lining the alveolar epithelium
of fetuses; high intensity but scattered staining in cells of preterm
infants; less intense and fewer positive cells in term infants; and no
staining in alveolar epithelial cells of infants with BPD. COX2
bronchial epithelial staining was found in almost all fetal cells, in
approximately half of cells from preterm infants and infants with BPD,
and in fewer cells from term infants. The authors suggested that COX2
may play a developmental role in perinatal lung.

COX2 has been associated with carcinogenesis, and it is overexpressed in
many human malignancies. Salmenkivi et al. (2001) investigated the
expression of COX2 in normal adrenal gland, in 92 primary
pheochromocytomas, and in 6 metastases using immunohistochemistry and
Northern blot and Western blot analyses. COX2 protein was expressed in
the adrenal cortex, whereas the medulla was negative as detected by
immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, all 8 malignant pheochromocytomas,
regardless of the primary location of the tumor, showed moderate or
strong COX2 immunoreactivity, whereas 75% of the 36 benign adrenal
tumors showed no or only weak immunopositivity. The authors concluded
that normal adrenal medulla does not express COX2 immunohistochemically.
However, strong COX2 protein expression was found in malignant
pheochromocytomas, whereas most benign tumors expressed COX2 only
weakly. These findings suggested that negative or weak COX2 expression
in pheochromocytomas favors benign diagnosis.

Yokota et al. (2002) found that brown fat in normal human bone marrow
contains adiponectin (605441) and used marrow-derived preadipocyte lines
and long-term cultures to explore potential roles of adiponectin in
hematopoiesis. Recombinant adiponectin blocked fat cell formation in
long-term bone marrow cultures and inhibited the differentiation of
cloned stromal preadipocytes. Adiponectin also caused elevated
expression of COX2 by these stromal cells and induced release of
prostaglandin E2. A COX2 inhibitor prevented the inhibitory action of
adiponectin on preadipocyte differentiation, suggesting involvement of
stromal cell-derived prostanoids. Furthermore, adiponectin failed to
block fat cell generation when bone marrow cells were derived from COX2
heterozygous mice. Yokota et al. (2002) concluded that preadipocytes
represent direct targets for adiponectin action, establishing a
paracrine negative feedback loop for fat regulation. They also linked
adiponectin to the COX2-dependent prostaglandins that are critical in
this process.

Estrogen-induced responses in vascular cells have been shown to
influence prostaglandins and COX, a key enzyme in the production of
prostaglandins that has 2 isoforms, COX1 and COX2. Calkin et al. (2002)
investigated the effects of prostaglandins on the acute potentiation by
17-beta-estradiol of acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated vasodilation in the
cutaneous vasculature. Acute 17-beta-estradiol administration enhanced
the response to ACh after aspirin, diclofenac, and placebo; however,
this effect was completely abolished with treatment with celecoxib, a
specific COX2 inhibitor p less than 0.05). The authors concluded that
the COX2 pathway plays a specific role in the rapid
17-beta-estradiol-induced potentiation of cholinergic vasodilation in
postmenopausal women.

COX2 expression is translationally silenced in epithelial cells
undergoing radiation-induced apoptosis. Mukhopadhyay et al. (2003) found
that CUGBP2 (602538), a predominantly nuclear protein, is also rapidly
induced in response to radiation and translocates to the cytoplasm.
Antisense-mediated suppression of CUGBP2 rendered radioprotection
through a COX2-dependent prostaglandin pathway, providing an in vivo
demonstration of translation inhibition activity for CUGBP2. CUGBP2
bound to 2 sets of AU-rich sequences located within the first 60
nucleotides of the COX2 3-prime untranslated region (UTR). Upon binding,
CUGBP2 stabilized a chimeric luciferase-COX2 3-prime UTR mRNA but
inhibited its translation. These findings identified a novel paradigm
for RNA-binding proteins in facilitating opposing functions of mRNA
stability and translation inhibition and revealed a mechanism for
inhibiting COX2 expression in cancer cells.

Qin et al. (2003) found that expression of COX1 or COX2 in hamster and
human cells exogenously and endogenously expressing human amyloid
precursor protein (APP; 104760) induced production of the amyloid
peptides A-beta(1-40) and A-beta(1-42), as well as the
gamma-secretase-generated C-terminal fragment of APP. Peptide production
was coincident with the secretion of prostaglandin-E2 into the culture
medium. Treatment of APP-overexpressing cells with ibuprofen or with a
specific gamma-secretase inhibitor significantly attenuated COX1- and
COX2-mediated APP peptide production.

In rat hippocampal slices, Kim and Alger (2004) found evidence
suggesting that COX2 limits endocannabinoid action and signaling between
neurons.

Xu et al. (2004) demonstrated that activated T cells of patients with
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) resisted anergy and apoptosis
by markedly upregulating and sustaining COX2 expression. Inhibition of
COX2 caused apoptosis of the anergy-resistant lupus T cells by
augmenting FAS (134637) signaling and markedly decreasing the survival
molecule FLIP (603599), and this mechanism was found to involve
anergy-resistant lupus T cells selectively. Xu et al. (2004) noted that
the COX2 gene is located in a lupus susceptibility region on chromosome
1. They also found that only some COX2 inhibitors were able to suppress
the production of pathogenic autoantibodies to DNA by causing autoimmune
T-cell apoptosis, an effect that was independent of PGE2.

Egan et al. (2004) reported that estrogen acts on estrogen receptor
subtype alpha (133430) to upregulate the production of atheroprotective
prostacyclin (PGI2) by activation of COX2. This mechanism restrained
both oxidant stress and platelet activation that contribute to
atherogenesis in female mice. Deletion of the Pgi2 receptor removed the
atheroprotective effect of estrogen in ovariectomized female mice. Egan
et al. (2004) concluded that this suggested that chronic treatment of
patients with selective inhibitors of COX2 could undermine protection
from cardiovascular disease in premenopausal females.

Kothapalli et al. (2004) investigated the antimitogenic effect of high
density lipoprotein (HDL) on the inhibition of S-phase entry of murine
aortic smooth muscle cells, which they found to be mediated by
apolipoprotein E (APOE; 107741). They also demonstrated that specific
inhibition of Cox2 blocks the antimitogenic effects of HDL and Apoe,
that both HDL and Apoe induce Cox2 gene expression, and that the
prostacyclin receptor IP (600022) is required for the antimitogenic
effects of HDL and Apoe. Kothapalli et al. (2004) concluded that the
COX2 gene is a target of APOE signaling, linking HDL and APOE to IP
action, and suggested that this mechanism may contribute to the
cardioprotective effect of HDL and APOE.

By in vivo selection, transcriptomic analysis, functional verification,
and clinical validation, Minn et al. (2005) identified a set of genes
that marks and mediates breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Some of
these genes serve dual functions, providing growth advantages both in
the primary tumor and in the lung microenvironment. Others contribute to
aggressive growth selectivity in the lung. Among the lung metastasis
signature genes identified, several, including PTGS2, were functionally
validated. Those subjects expressing the lung metastasis signature had a
significantly poorer lung metastasis-free survival, but not bone
metastasis-free survival, compared to subjects without the signature.

Liu et al. (2004) found that nitric oxide (NO) induced COX2 expression
in a human colorectal cell line and in nontransformed mouse colon
epithelial cells. NO-induced induction was due to PEA3 (ETV4;
600711)-p300 (EP300; 602700)-mediated activation of an ETS site and an
NFIL6 (CEBPB; 189965)-binding site in the COX2 promoter.

Kim et al. (2005) showed that inducible NO synthase (iNOS; 163730)
specifically binds to COX2 and S-nitrosylates it, enhancing COX2
catalytic activity. Selectively disrupting iNOS-COX2 binding prevented
NO-mediated activation of COX2. Kim et al. (2005) suggested that the
molecular synergism between iNOS and COX2 may represent a major
mechanism of inflammatory responses.

Metastasis entails numerous biologic functions that collectively enable
cancerous cells from a primary site to disseminate and overtake distant
organs. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, Gupta et al. (2007)
showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand epiregulin
(602061), the cyclooxygenase COX2, and the matrix metalloproteinases
MMP1 (120353) and MMP2 (120360), when expressed in human breast cancer
cells, collectively facilitate the assembly of new tumor blood vessels,
the release of tumor cells into the circulation, and the breaching of
lung capillaries by circulating tumor cells to seed pulmonary
metastasis. Gupta et al. (2007) concluded that their findings revealed
how aggressive primary tumorigenic functions can be mechanistically
coupled to greater lung metastatic potential, and how such biologic
activities can be therapeutically targeted with specific drug
combinations.

To identify new modulators of hematopoietic stem cell formation and
homeostasis, North et al. (2007) screened a panel of biologically active
compounds for effects on stem cell induction in the zebrafish
aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. The authors showed that chemicals that
enhance prostaglandin E2 synthesis increased hematopoietic stem cell
numbers, and those that blocked prostaglandin synthesis decreased stem
cell numbers. The cyclooxygenases responsible for PGE2 synthesis were
required for hematopoietic stem cell formation. A stable derivative of
PGE2 improved kidney marrow recovery following irradiation injury in
adult zebrafish. In murine embryonic stem cell differentiation assays,
PGE2 caused amplification of multipotent progenitors. Furthermore, in
vivo exposure to stabilized PGE2 enhanced spleen colony-forming units at
day 12 post transplant and increased the frequency of long-term
repopulating hematopoietic stem cells present in murine bone marrow
after limiting dilution competitive transplantation. The conserved role
for PGE2 in the regulation of vertebrate hematopoietic stem cell
homeostasis indicates that modulation of the prostaglandin pathway may
facilitate expansion of hematopoietic stem cell number for therapeutic
purposes.

Using RT-PCR, Pan et al. (2008) showed that both COX2 and CCR7 (600242)
were upregulated in a significant number of breast tumor samples
compared with adjacent normal tissue, and that this upregulation was
associated with enhanced lymph node metastasis. Overexpression and
knockdown studies in human breast cancer cell lines revealed that COX2
acted via the prostaglandin receptors EP2 (PTGER2; 176804) and EP4
(PTGER4; 601586), resulting in increased intracellular cAMP and
activation of the PKA (see 188830)-AKT (see 164730) signaling pathway,
which led to induction of CCR7 expression. Elevated CCR7 enhanced the
migration of breast cancer cells toward lymphatic endothelial cells,
suggesting that CCR7 upregulation ultimately mediates COX2-associated
lymph node metastasis.

Bos et al. (2009) isolated cells that preferentially infiltrate the
brain from patients with advanced breast cancer. Gene expression
analysis of these cells and of clinical samples, coupled with functional
analysis, identified the cyclooxygenase COX2, the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) ligand HBEGF (126150), and the
alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC5 (610134) as mediators of cancer
cell passage through the blood-brain barrier. EGFR ligands and COX2 had
been linked to breast cancer infiltration of the lungs, but not the
bones or liver, suggesting a sharing of these mediators in cerebral and
pulmonary metastases. In contrast, ST6GALNAC5 specifically mediates
brain metastasis. Normally restricted to the brain, the expression of
ST6GALNAC5 in breast cancer cells enhances their adhesion to brain
endothelial cells and their passage through the blood-brain barrier.
This co-option of a brain sialyltransferase highlights the role of cell
surface glycosylation in organ-specific metastatic interactions. Bos et
al. (2009) demonstrated that breast cancer metastasis to the brain
involves mediators of extravasation through nonfenestrated capillaries,
complemented by specific enhancers of blood-brain barrier crossing and
brain colonization.

The acetylation of COX2 by aspirin enables the biosynthesis of
R-containing precursors of endogenous antiinflammatory mediators termed
resolvins (Serhan et al., 2002). Spite et al. (2009) established the
complete stereochemistry of endogenous resolvin-D2 and its potent
stereoselective actions facilitating resolution of inflammatory sepsis.

Coward et al. (2009) found that expression of COX2 mRNA and protein and
production of PGE2 was induced by TGF-beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180) and IL1B in
cultured normal lung fibroblasts, but not in fibroblasts cultured from
lung tissue of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF;
178500). They showed that defective histone acetylation was responsible
for diminished COX2 transcription in IPF.

Using mouse models, Vegiopoulos et al. (2010) showed that COX2, a
rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis, is a downstream
effector of beta-adrenergic signaling in white adipose tissue and is
required for the induction of brown adipose tissue in white adipose
tissue depots. Prostaglandin shifted the differentiation of defined
mesenchymal progenitors toward a brown adipocyte phenotype.
Overexpression of COX2 in white adipose tissue induced de novo brown
adipose tissue recruitment in white adipose tissue, increased systemic
energy expenditure, and protected mice against high fat diet-induced
obesity. Thus, Vegiopoulos et al. (2010) concluded that COX2 appears
integral to de novo brown adipose tissue recruitment, which suggests
that the prostaglandin pathway regulates systemic energy homeostasis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tazawa et al. (1994) isolated the entire PGHS2 gene and its 5-prime
flanking region and showed that it contains 10 exons and spans 7.5 kb.
By comparison, the murine and human PGHS1 genes comprise 11 exons and 10
introns and are approximately 22 kb long (Kraemer et al., 1992).

Kosaka et al. (1994) determined that the PTGS2 gene contains 10 coding
exons and spans more than 8.3 kb. The upstream region and intron 1
contain a canonical TATA box and various transcriptional regulatory
elements, including a functional cAMP response element.

MAPPING

Jones et al. (1993) and Tazawa et al. (1994) mapped the PTGS2 gene to
chromosome 1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Tay et al. (1994)
mapped the PTGS2 gene to chromosome 1q25. Using FISH, Kosaka et al.
(1994) mapped the PTGS2 gene to chromosome 1q25.2-q25.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Fritsche et al. (2001) sequenced the COX2 gene from 72 individuals and
identified no functionally important polymorphisms. They suggested that
there has been selective pressure against such SNPs because of the
critical role of COX2 in the maintenance of homeostasis.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT

Xia et al. (2012) showed that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) silences certain
tumor suppressor and DNA repair genes through DNA methylation to promote
tumor growth. Their findings uncovered a theretofore unrecognized role
for PGE2 in the promotion of tumor progression, and provided a rationale
for considering the development of a combination treatment using PTGS2
inhibitors and demethylating agents for the prevention or treatment of
colorectal cancer.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morham et al. (1995) noted that COX2 is induced at high levels in
migratory and other responding cells by proinflammatory stimuli. COX2 is
generally considered to be a mediator of inflammation. Its isoform,
COX1, is constitutively expressed in most tissues and is thought to
mediate housekeeping functions. These 2 enzymes are therapeutic targets
of the widely used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). To
investigate further the different physiologic roles of these isoforms,
Morham et al. (1995) used homologous recombination to disrupt the mouse
gene encoding Cox2 (Ptgs2). Mice lacking Cox2 were found to have normal
inflammatory responses to treatments with tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate
or arachidonic acid. However, they developed severe nephropathy and were
susceptible to peritonitis.

Oshima et al. (1996) bred mice carrying an APC (611731) mutation (a
truncation at residue 716) that causes adenomatous polyposis coli
closely mimicking that in the human with mice with a disrupted Ptgs2
gene. All the animals were APC heterozygotes; if homozygous for wildtype
Ptgs2, they developed an average of 652 polyps at 10 weeks, while
heterozygotes had 224 polyps and homozygously deficient mice had only 93
polyps. This experiment provided definitive genetic evidence that
induction of Ptgs2 is an early rate-limiting step for adenoma formation.
They showed also that a drug which inhibits the COX2 isoform encoded by
Ptgs2, but not COX1, also markedly reduced the number of polyps. Thus,
Oshima et al. (1996) concluded that overexpression of COX2 is an early,
central event in carcinogenesis.

Lim et al. (1997) generated COX2-deficient mice by gene targeting. These
mice showed multiple failures in female reproductive processes that
included ovulation, fertilization, implantation, and decidualization.
The authors concluded that the defects in these mice were the direct
result of target organ-specific COX2 deficiency and not the result of
deficiency of pituitary gonadotropins or ovarian steroid hormones, or
reduced responsiveness of the target organs to their respective
hormones.

The transition to pulmonary respiration following birth requires rapid
alterations in the structure of the mammalian cardiovascular system. A
dramatic change that occurs is the closure and remodeling of the ductus
arteriosus (DA; see 607411), an arterial connection in the fetus that
directs blood flow away from the pulmonary circulation. A role of
prostaglandins in regulating the closure of this vessel is supported by
pharmacologic and genetic studies. The production of prostaglandins is
dependent on COX1 and COX2. Loftin et al. (2001) reported that the
absence of either or both COX isoforms in mice did not result in
premature closure of the DA in utero. However, 35% of COX2 -/- mice died
with a patent DA within 48 hours of birth. In contrast, the absence of
only the COX1 isoform did not affect closure of the DA. The mortality
and patent DA incidence due to absence of COX2 was, however, increased
to 79% when one copy of the gene encoding COX1 was also inactivated.
Furthermore, 100% of the mice deficient in both isoforms died with a
patent DA within 12 hours of birth, indicating that in COX2-deficient
mice, the contribution of COX1 to DA closure is gene dosage-dependent.
Together, these data established roles for COX1 and especially for COX2
in the transition of the cardiopulmonary circulation at birth.

pulmonary inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in wildtype mice
and in Ptgs1 -/- and Ptgs2 -/- mice.

In mice and humans, deregulated expression of COX2, but not of COX1, is
characteristic of epithelial tumors, including squamous cell carcinomas
of skin. To explore the function of COX2 in epidermis, Neufang et al.
(2001) used a keratin-5 (148040) promoter to direct COX2 expression to
the basal cells of interfollicular epidermis and the pilosebaceous
appendage of transgenic mouse skin. Cox2 overexpression in the expected
locations, resulting in increased prostaglandin levels in epidermis and
plasma, correlated with a pronounced skin phenotype. Heterozygous
transgenic mice exhibited a reduced hair follicle density. Moreover,
postnatal hair follicle morphogenesis and thinning of interfollicular
dorsal epidermis were delayed. Adult transgenics showed a body
site-dependent sparse coat of greasy hair, the latter caused by
sebaceous gland hyperplasia and increased epicutaneous sebum levels. In
tail skin, hyperplasia of scale epidermis reflecting an increased number
of viable and cornified cell layers was observed. Hyperplasia was a
result of a disturbed program of epidermal differentiation rather than
an increased proliferation rate, as reflected by the strong suppression
of keratin-10 (148080), involucrin (147360), and loricrin (152445)
expression in suprabasal cells. Further pathologic signs were loss of
cell polarity, mainly of basal keratinocytes, epidermal invaginations
into the dermis, and formation of horn perls. Invaginating hyperplastic
lobes were surrounded by vessels testing positive for CD31,
platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (173445).

In a mouse model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), Wilkinson-Berka et
al. (2003) found that Cox2 was localized to sites associated with
retinal blood vessels. The selective Cox2 inhibitor rofecoxib attenuated
retinal angiogenesis that accompanied ROP. Normal retinal development
indicated that COX2 plays an important role in blood vessel formation in
the developing retina.

Brewer et al. (2003) generated healthy mice lacking glucocorticoid
receptor (GCCR; 138040) only in T cells and thymus. Gccr was dispensable
for T-cell development, but administration of a T-cell stimulus or
superantigen to mutant mice, but not control mice, resulted in high
mortality that could not be rescued by dexamethasone or anti-Ifng
(147570). Microarray and ribonuclease protection analyses suggested that
endogenous glucocorticoids are required for transcriptional suppression
of Ifng, but not Tnf or Il2 (147680), in T cells. Inhibition of Cox2
protected mice from lethality without affecting Ifng levels. Histologic
analysis revealed that T-cell stimulation in mutant mice caused
significant damage to the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the
cecum, but little or no damage in other tissues. Brewer et al. (2003)
concluded that Gccr function in T cells is essential for survival during
polyclonal T-cell activation. Furthermore, they suggested that Cox2
inhibition may be useful for treatment of glucocorticoid insufficiency
or resistance in patients with toxic shock syndrome (see 607395),
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; see 614395), or other T-cell activating
processes.

Liu et al. (2001) generated transgenic mice that overexpressed the human
COX2 gene in the mammary glands using the murine mammary tumor virus
promoter. The human COX2 mRNA and protein were expressed in mammary
glands of female transgenic mice and were strongly induced during
pregnancy and lactation. Multiparous but not virgin females exhibited a
greatly exaggerated incidence of focal mammary gland hyperplasia,
dysplasia, and transformation into metastatic tumors. COX2-induced tumor
tissue expressed reduced levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins BAX
(600040) and BCLXL (600039) and an increase in the anti-apoptotic
protein BCL2, suggesting that decreased apoptosis of mammary epithelial
cells contributes to tumorigenesis. Liu et al. (2001) concluded that
enhanced COX2 expression is sufficient to induce mammary gland
tumorigenesis.

Using Cox1 -/- and Cox2 -/- mice, Zhang et al. (2002) demonstrated that
COX2 plays a role in both endochondral and intramembranous bone
formation during skeletal repair. Healing of stabilized tibia fractures
was significantly delayed in Cox2 -/- mice compared with Cox1 -/- and
wildtype mice. Cultured Cox2 -/- bone marrow stromal cells showed a
defect in osteogenesis that could be completely rescued by addition of
prostaglandin E2. Addition of Bmp2 (112261) enhanced bone formation to a
level above that observed with prostaglandin E2 alone in both wildtype
and Cox2 -/- cells, indicating the BMP2 is downstream of prostaglandin
production. Expression of Cbfa1 (RUNX2; 600211) and osterix (SP7;
606633) was downregulated in Cox2 -/- cells. Addition of prostaglandin
E2 rescued this defect, and Bmp2 enhanced Cbfa1 and osterix in Cox2 -/-
and wildtype cells. Zhang et al. (2002) concluded that COX2 regulates
induction of CBFA1 and osterix to mediate normal skeletal repair.

Zhang et al. (2003) generated a transgenic mouse model overexpressing
TGM2 (190196) in cardiomyocytes and found that the mice had an
age-dependent left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac decompensation,
characterized by cardiomyocyte apoptosis and fibrosis and a delayed
impact on survival. Expression of COX2, thromboxane synthase (274180),
and the thromboxane receptor (188070) were increased coincident with the
emergence of the cardiac phenotype. The COX2-dependent increase in
thromboxane A2 augmented cardiac hypertrophy, whereas formation of PGI2
by the same isozyme, as well as administration of COX2 inhibitors,
rescued the cardiac phenotype. Zhang et al. (2003) concluded that TGM2
activation regulates expression of COX2, and that its products may
differentially modulate cell death or survival of cardiomyocytes.

Boccaccio et al. (2005) developed a mouse model of sporadic
tumorigenesis in which they targeted the activated human MET oncogene
(164860) to adult liver. They observed slowly progressive
hepatocarcinogenesis, which was preceded and accompanied by a
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like thrombohemorrhagic
syndrome. Genomewide expression profiling of MLP29 cells transduced with
the activated MET oncogene revealed prominent upregulation of
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI1; 173360) and COX2, and in vivo
administration of a PAI1 or COX2 inhibitor slowed the evolution towards
full-blown DIC. Boccaccio et al. (2005) concluded that this study
provided the first direct genetic evidence for the link between oncogene
activation and hemostasis.

Brown et al. (2007) found that Myd88 (602170) -/- mice and Ptgs2 -/-
mice exhibited a profound inhibition of endothelial proliferation and
cellular organization within rectal crypts after injury. The effects of
injury in both mutant mouse strains could be rescued by exogenous PGE2,
suggesting that Myd88 signaling is upstream of Ptgs2 and PGE2. In
wildtype mice, the combination of injury and Myd88 signaling led to
repositioning of a subset of Ptgs2-expressing stromal cells from the
mesenchyme surrounding the middle and upper crypts to an area
surrounding the crypt base adjacent to colonic epithelial progenitor
cells. Brown et al. (2007) concluded that the MYD88 and prostaglandin
signaling pathways interact to preserve epithelial proliferation during
injury, and that proper cellular mobilization within the crypt niche is
critical to repair after injury.

Vardeh et al. (2009) observed that mice with conditional deletion of
Cox2 in neurons and glial cells, but not in peripheral immune cells,
showed no difference in basal nociception to mechanical or thermal pain
sensitivity from wildtype mice. There was also no difference in fever
induction. However, after induction of peripheral inflammation, mutant
mice had loss of Cox2 expression in the spinal cord and showed loss of
mechanical hypersensivity. The findings suggested that induction of Cox2
in neural cells in the central nervous system contributes to mechanical
pain hypersensitivity after peripheral inflammation, as is seen in
postoperative pain and arthritis. Peripheral Cox2 induction appears to
regulate thermal hypersensitivity, such as seen in sunburn or other
dermatologic conditions.

Shim et al. (2010) found that transgenic mice overexpressing human COX2
died shortly after birth, likely due to inability to inflate lungs.
Transgenic embryos exhibited severe skeletal malformations, generalized
edema, midfacial hypoplasia, and occasional umbilical hernia. The
skeletal defects were due to abnormal apoptosis of sclerotomal cells in
early embryonic development, which resulted in impaired precartilaginous
sclerotomal condensation.

607803	TITLE *607803 CYCLIN M2; CNNM2
;;ANCIENT CONSERVED DOMAIN PROTEIN 2; ACDP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By positional cloning in the urofacial syndrome (UFS; 236730) critical
region on chromosome 10q23-q24, Wang et al. (2003) cloned a gene (CNNM1;
607802) encoding a protein with strong amino acid sequence homology to
EST clusters derived from different chromosomes. Using these clusters as
starting points, they cloned 4 genes belonging to a novel family, which
they designated ACDP (ancient conserved domain protein) because all 4
deduced proteins share a domain (ACD) conserved in a large number of
species from bacteria to man. In addition, all 4 contain a 31-amino acid
sequence motif that is present in the cyclin box, a cyclic
nucleotide-monophosphate (cNMP)-binding domain, and 2 CBS domains. The
ACDP2 gene, designated CNNM2 by the HUGO Nomenclature Committee, encodes
a deduced 875-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of CNNM2. Immunofluorescence studies showed that
all 4 CNMM proteins are predominantly localized in the nucleus.

Wang et al. (2004) cloned a mouse Acdp2 encoding a deduced 874-amino
acid protein that shares 97% identity with human ACDP2. Acdp2 contains 4
transmembrane domains, 2 CBS domains, a DUF21 domain, and a cNMP-binding
domain. It also has a glycine-rich region. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected Acdp2 in brain, kidney, and liver.

Goytain and Quamme (2005) cloned a mouse Acdp2 encoding a deduced
693-amino acid protein. Acdp2 contains 4 transmembrane regions and
possible sites for N-glycosylation and phosphorylation. RT-PCR detected
highest Acdp2 expression in kidney and brain, with lower amounts in all
other tissues examined.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Wang et al. (2003) mapped the CNNM2 gene
to chromosome 10q24-q26, between markers D10S222 and SGC31986.

By genomic sequence analysis, Goytain and Quamme (2005) mapped the CNNM2
gene to chromosome 10q24.33. They mapped the mouse Cnnm2 gene to
chromosome 19C3.

GENE FUNCTION

Using real-time RT-PCR, Goytain and Quamme (2005) found that expression
of Acdp2 increased in mouse distal convoluted tubule cells cultured in
low magnesium media relative to normal media and in kidney cortex and
heart of mice maintained on low magnesium diets compared with those on
normal diets. Expression of Acdp2 in Xenopus oocytes mediated saturable
Mg(2+) uptake that was rheogenic, voltage dependent, and not coupled to
Na+ or Cl-. Acdp2 transported Mg(2+), Co(2+), Mn(2+), Sr(2+), Ba(2+),
Cu(2+), and Fe(2+). No currents were induced by Ca(2+), Cd(2+), Zn(2+),
or Ni(2+), and only Zn(2+) inhibited transport.

By immunohistochemical analysis of mouse and human kidney sections,
Stuiver et al. (2011) demonstrated expression of CNNM2 in both the thick
ascending limb of the Henle loop and the distal collecting tubule (DCT),
with a consistently basolateral staining pattern. In mouse DCT cells,
there was significant (2.7-fold) upregulation of Cnnm2 transcripts in
cells grown under low Mg(2+) compared to control conditions, whereas low
Ca(2+) had no significant effect on Cnnm2 mRNA levels. Patch-clamp
studies in transiently transfected HEK293 cells revealed that CNNM2
mediates Mg(2+)-sensitive Na(+) currents that are blocked by increased
extracellular Mg(2+) concentrations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Intracranial Berry Aneurysm

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the CNNM2
gene and intracranial berry aneurysm, see ANIB1 (105800).

- Renal Hypomagnesemia 6

In affected individuals from a Dutch and a Czech family segregating
autosomal dominant renal hypomagnesemia (HOMG6; 613882) Stuiver et al.
(2011) analyzed the candidate gene CNNM2 and identified heterozygosity
for a 1-bp deletion (607803.0001) and a missense mutation (607803.0002),
respectively. Electrophysiologic analysis showed that CNNM2-mediated
Mg(2+)-sensitive Na(+) currents were significantly diminished with the
missense protein compared to wildtype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOMAGNESEMIA 6, RENAL
CNNM2, 1-BP DEL, 117G

In a Dutch father and daughter with renal hypomagnesemia (HOMG6;
613882), Stuiver et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion (117delG) in the CNNM2 gene, causing a frameshift and premature
stop codon that results in a truncated 53-amino acid protein. The
mutation was not found in 202 ethnically matched chromosomes.

.0002
HYPOMAGNESEMIA 6, RENAL
CNNM2, THR568ILE

In a mother and son from the Czech Republic with renal hypomagnesemia
(HOMG6; 613882), Stuiver et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a
1703C-T transition in the CNNM2 gene, resulting in a thr568-to-ile
(T568I) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the ancient
conserved domain. The mutation was not found in 214 ethnically matched
chromosomes. Patch-clamp studies in transiently transfected HEK293 cells
showed that CNNM2-mediated Mg(2+)-sensitive Na(+) currents were
significantly diminished with mutant protein compared to wildtype.

606985	TITLE *606985 ELONGATOR ACETYLTRANSFERASE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 4; ELP4
;;ELONGATION PROTEIN 4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
PAX6 NEIGHBOR GENE; PAX6NEB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The yeast Elp4 protein is 1 of 6 subunits of elongator, a histone
acetylase complex that associates with the elongating form of RNA
polymerase-2. By database searching with yeast Elp4 as the query,
Winkler et al. (2001) obtained cDNAs encoding ELP4 in multiple species,
including human. The 424-amino acid human protein is 41% similar to
yeast Elp4. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous but variable
expression in human tissues.

Kleinjan et al. (2002) identified ELP4, which they called PAXNEB, by
sequencing ESTs from a region telomeric of the PAX6 gene (607108).
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb transcript in all cell lines
tested. Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis found wide expression
of Paxneb in mouse embryos.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Kleinjan et al. (2002) determined that the
PAXNEB gene contains 10 exons transcribed in a telomere-to-centromere
direction, opposite to that of PAX6. The PAXNEB gene contains an
unusually large last intron covering 134 kb. Promoter analysis indicated
a GC-rich region lacking TATA or CAAT boxes, features typical of a
housekeeping gene.

Strug et al. (2009) determined that the ELP4 gene contains 12 exons
spanning 274 kb. They noted that alternative transcripts have been
reported that include or exclude the last 2 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kleinjan et al. (2002) mapped the PAXNEB
gene to chromosome 11p13, a region associated with WAGR syndrome
(194072) and loss of heterozygosity in breast and bladder cancers.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the ELP4
gene and susceptibility to rolandic epilepsy, see 117100.

ANIMAL MODEL

Loss-of-function mutations in the PAX6 gene are associated with the eye
anomaly aniridia (106210) in humans and the 'small eye' phenotype in
mice. However, some case of aniridia have been identified in which
chromosomal rearrangements leave the PAX6 gene intact and interrupt the
PAXNEB gene. Using a transgenic mouse model, Kleinjan et al. (2002)
failed to show that the small eye phenotype in mice is caused by
heterozygous loss of Paxneb function.

609671	TITLE *609671 SIX-TRANSMEMBRANE EPITHELIAL ANTIGEN OF PROSTATE 3; STEAP3
;;TUMOR SUPPRESSOR-ACTIVATED PATHWAY 6; TSAP6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Passer et al. (2003) cloned human STEAP3, which they called TSAP6, from
a pooled-tissue cDNA library. The deduced 488-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal motif associated with oxidoreductases and
dehydrogenases and 5 or 6 transmembrane domains. Human TSAP6 shares 87%
amino acid identity with mouse Tsap6. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 4.3-kb transcript expressed highly in liver and at a
lower level in skeletal muscle. Heart, brain, placenta, lung, kidney,
and pancreas expressed little to no TSAP6. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected expression predominantly in heart, spleen, lung,
liver, and skeletal muscle. Western blot analysis of mouse and human
cell lines detected TSAP6 at an apparent molecular mass of 50 to 55 kD.

Using Western blot analysis, Lespagnol et al. (2008) detected Tsap6
proteins of 46 and 52 kD in mouse NIH3T3 cells, and they showed that the
larger protein resulted from glycosylation. Confocal microscopy of mouse
embryonic fibroblasts showed colocalization of endogenous Tsap6 with the
trans-Golgi network maker Tgn38 (TGOLN; 603062). Punctuated cytoplasmic
and plasma membrane staining of Tsap6 partially colocalized with
transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010) and Eea1 (605070), suggesting that
Tsap6 is expressed in the endosomal compartment.

MAPPING

By FISH, Passer et al. (2003) mapped the STEAP3 gene to chromosome
2q14.2. They mapped the mouse Steap3 gene to chromosome 1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis, Passer et al. (2003) found that p53 (TP53;
191170) upregulated TSAP6 expression in mouse and human cell lines. They
identified a p53-responsive element upstream of the first exon of the
mouse Tsap6 gene. TSAP6 antisense cDNA decreased the level of
p53-induced apoptosis, and TSAP6 small interfering RNA inhibited
apoptosis in TSAP6-overexpressing cells. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis,
protein pull-down assays, and coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed
that TSAP6 interacted with NIX (BNIP3; 605368), a proapoptotic BCL2
(151430)-related protein, and with MYT1 kinase (602474), a negative
regulator of G2/M transition. Moreover, TSAP6 enhanced the
susceptibility of cells to apoptosis and cooperated with NIX to
exacerbate this effect. Cell cycle studies indicated that TSAP6 could
augment MYT1 activity. Passer et al. (2003) concluded that TSAP6 may act
downstream of p53 to interface apoptosis and cell cycle progression.

Histamine-releasing factor (TPT1; 600763) is a secreted protein that
participates in inflammatory responses by promoting the release of
histamine. Amzallag et al. (2004) found that secretion of TPT1 proceeded
by a nonclassical pathway independent of the endoplasmic reticulum and
Golgi apparatus. They determined that TSAP6 interacted with TPT1 in
several protein interaction assays, and the 2 proteins codistributed to
small vesicles called exosomes at the plasma membrane and around the
nucleus in several human cell lines. Overexpression of TSAP6 increased
the level of TPT1 in exosome preparations and consistently enhanced TPT1
secretion. Amzallag et al. (2004) concluded that TSAP6 has a role in the
export of TPT1 via a nonclassical pathway and suggested that TSAP6 may
have a general role in the regulation of vesicular trafficking and
secretion.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 sibs with hypochromic microcytic anemia and iron overload (615234),
born of nonconsanguineous Pakistani parents, Grandchamp et al. (2011)
analyzed 7 candidate genes and identified heterozygosity for a nonsense
mutation in the STEAP3 gene (C100X; 609671.0001) that was inherited from
their unaffected father. Quantitative analysis of mRNA levels suggested
that the father was heterozygous with 1 null allele and 1 normal, highly
expressed allele, whereas their unaffected mother had 2 weakly expressed
alleles, and each affected offspring had inherited the mutated allele
from their father and 1 of the weakly expressed alleles from their
mother. Using two 3-prime common polymorphisms in high linkage
disequilibrium as markers to perform quantitative sequencing of cDNA
from the blood of 20 control individuals, Grandchamp et al. (2011)
demonstrated a 2.5-fold variation in the C/T and A/C ratios among 17
individuals informative for dbSNP rs6753006 and 12 individuals
informative for dbSNP rs3731603, respectively, thus confirming
variability of STEAP3 expression in the general population.

ANIMAL MODEL

The reduction of iron is an essential step in the transferrin (TF;
190000) cycle, which is the dominant pathway for iron uptake by red
blood cell precursors. A deficiency in iron acquisition by red blood
cells leads to hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Using a positional
cloning strategy, Ohgami et al. (2005) identified the Steap3 gene as
responsible for the iron deficiency anemia in the mouse mutant nm1054.
They showed that Steap3 is expressed highly in hematopoietic tissues,
colocalizes with the transferrin cycle endosome, and facilitates
transferrin-bound iron uptake. Overexpression of Steap3 stimulated the
reduction of iron, and mice lacking Steap3 were deficient in erythroid
ferrireductase activity. These findings taken together were interpreted
as indicating that Steap3 is an endosomal ferrireductase required for
efficient transferrin-dependent iron uptake in erythroid cells.

Lespagnol et al. (2008) generated Tsap6 -/- mice and found that Tsap6
-/- splenocytes accumulated Tctp (TPT1) and Tfrc. Spleens of Tsap6 -/-
mice were enlarged with altered splenic architecture on histopathologic
analysis, and reticulocytes and erythrocytes were small and abnormally
shaped, consistent with microcytic anemia. Analysis of reticulocyte
maturation revealed a delay in Tfrc expulsion and reduced secretion of
exosomes. Induction of p53-mediated apoptosis, but not of p53- dependent
p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) expression, was attenuated in Tsap6 -/- spleen.
Following activation of p53 by DNA damage, Tsap6 -/- cells exhibited a
significant reduction in exosome secretion and an absence of exosomal
protein upregulation compared with wildtype controls. Lespagnol et al.
(2008) concluded that increased p53-mediated secretion of exosomes
following DNA damage is dependent on TSAP6 and that TSAP6 is needed to
expel proteins no longer required by cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ANEMIA, HYPOCHROMIC MICROCYTIC, WITH IRON OVERLOAD 2 (1 family)
STEAP3, CYS100TER

In 3 sibs with hypochromic microcytic anemia and iron overload (615234),
born of nonconsanguineous Pakistani parents, Grandchamp et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for a c.300C-A transition in exon 3 of the
STEAP3 gene, resulting in a cys100-to-ter (C100X) substitution. The
mutation was inherited from their unaffected father and was not found in
their unaffected mother or 200 control chromosomes. Quantitative RT-PCR
from blood mRNA of all 5 family members and 10 controls showed that the
STEAP3 mRNA level was considerably lower in the 3 patients, whereas both
parents had a level of STEAP3 mRNA corresponding to the low-normal range
found in controls. In B lymphocyte-cell lines treated to prevent
degradation due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, quantitative sequencing
of a cDNA fragment encompassing the mutated nucleotide demonstrated that
expression of the normal allele relative to that of the mutated allele
was significantly higher in the father than in the 3 sibs. Grandchamp et
al. (2011) suggested that the father was heterozygous with 1 null allele
and 1 normal, highly expressed allele, whereas the mother had 2 weakly
expressed alleles, and each affected offspring had inherited the mutated
allele from their father and 1 of the weakly expressed alleles from
their mother. This was supported by the fact that expression of both
alleles from the mother produced an amount of mRNA that was roughly
equivalent to the expression products from the single normal allele of
the father.

612332	TITLE *612332 LIN7, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, C; LIN7C
;;VERTEBRATE LIN7 HOMOLOG 3; VELI3;;
MAMMALIAN LIN7 HOMOLOG 3; MALS3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching EST databases for homologs of C. elegans Lin7, Butz et al.
(1998) identified murine Lin7c, which they called Veli3. The deduced
197-amino acid Veli3 protein has a C-terminal PDZ domain.

By Northern blot analysis, Jo et al. (1999) found that rat Lin7c, which
they called Mals3, showed highest expression in kidney, followed by
brain and liver. Weak expression was detected in thymus and heart, and
no expression was detected in spleen. Mals3 had an apparent molecular
mass of 25 kD by Western blot analysis.

By immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization using antibodies and
cRNAs specific for mouse Mals1 (LIN7A; 603380), Mals2 (LIN7B; 612331),
and Mals3, Misawa et al. (2001) showed that each Mals protein localized
to distinct brain regions. The Mals proteins were predominantly
expressed in both neuronal cell bodies and neuropil, and they were not
detected in most nonneuronal cells in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Butz et al. (1998) identified a complex of 3 proteins in rat brain that
had the potential to couple synaptic vesicle exocytosis to neuronal cell
adhesion. The 3 proteins were Cask (300172), a protein related to
membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs); Mint1 (APBA1; 602414), a
putative vesicular trafficking protein; and the Velis. Cask, Mint1, and
the Velis formed a tight, salt-resistant complex. Butz et al. (1998)
determined that the N-terminal domains of Cask, Mint1, and the Velis
were involved in complex formation, leaving their C-terminal PDZ domains
free to recruit adhesion molecules, receptors, and channels to the
complex. Butz et al. (1998) proposed that the tripartite complex acts as
a nucleation site for the assembly of proteins involved in synaptic
vesicle exocytosis and synaptic junctions.

Jo et al. (1999) found that rat Mals proteins immunoprecipitated with
Psd95 (DLG4; 602887) and NMDA receptor-2B (GRIN2B; 138252) from
solubilized rat cerebral cortex membranes.

Misawa et al. (2001) found that Mals1 -/- Mals2 -/- double-knockout mice
appeared normal and showed normal excitatory synaptic activity in the
CA1 region of the hippocampus. Mals3 expression was upregulated in most
brain regions of the double-knockout mice, suggesting that Mals3 may
compensate for loss of Mals1 and Mals2 expression.

Aartsen et al. (2006) found that Mpp4 -/- mouse retinas showed
downregulation of Psd95 and mislocalization of both Psd95 and Veli3 at
the photoreceptor presynaptic membrane. They proposed that MPP4 may
function as a recruitment factor to organize signal transducers at the
photoreceptor synapse.

Onda et al. (2007) found that the expression of LIN7C was downregulated
in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC; see 275355) compared with normal
oral keratinocytes. Overexpression of LIN7C in OSCC cells resulted in a
noninvasive phenotype with elevated beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)
expression. In immunodeficient mice, tumor cells expressing LIN7C showed
reduced metastases. Onda et al. (2007) concluded that LIN7C in a tumor
suppressor that functions in the beta-catenin signaling pathway.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Taylor et al. (2006) mapped the LIN7C gene
to chromosome 11p14.1.

;;NONMETASTATIC PROTEIN 23, HOMOLOG 4; NM23H4;;
METASTASIS INHIBITION FACTOR NM23H4;;
NUCLEOSIDE DIPHOSPHATE KINASE D; NDPKD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinases (EC 2.7.4.6) are ubiquitous
enzymes that catalyze transfer of gamma-phosphates, via a
phosphohistidine intermediate, between nucleoside and dioxynucleoside
tri- and diphosphates. The enzymes are products of the nm23 gene family,
which includes NME4 (Milon et al., 1997).

CLONING

Milon et al. (1997) identified NME4, which they called nm23-H4, by
screening a human stomach cDNA library. The primers were designed from a
pubic database and the cDNA sequences were selected according to their
homology to the human NME1 (156490) putative metastasis suppressor gene.
The full-length cDNA sequence predicts a 187-amino acid protein
possessing the region homologous to NDP kinases with all residues
crucial for nucleotide binding and catalysis, strongly suggesting that
the new gene possesses NDP kinase activity. It shares 56, 55, and 60%
identity with NME1, NME2 (156491), and NME3 (601817), respectively.
Compared with these other proteins, NME4 contains an additional
N-terminal region that is rich in positively charged residues and could
indicate routing to mitochondria. The corresponding 1.2-kb mRNA was
widely distributed and expressed in tissue-dependent manner, being found
at very high levels in prostate, heart, liver, small intestine, and
skeletal muscle tissues, and in low amounts in the brain and in blood
leukocytes.

Masse et al. (2002) cloned mouse Nme4, which they called nm23-M4. The
deduced 186-amino acid protein shares 82% identity with human NME4.
Northern blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected a 1.0-kb
transcript only in heart, kidney, and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Human NDPKD and ubiquitous MTCK (CKMT1B; 123290) are basic peripheral
membrane proteins with symmetrical homooligomeric structures. Using
lipid dilution assays, Epand et al. (2007) showed that NDPKD and
ubiquitous MTCK facilitated lipid transfer from one bilayer to another.
Lipid transfer occurred between liposomes mimicking the lipid
composition of mitochondrial contact sites, containing 30 mol %
cardiolipin, but transfer did not occur when cardiolipin was replaced by
phosphatidylglycerol. Ubiquitous MTCK, but not NDPKD, showed some
specificity in lipids transferred. Lipid transfer did not involve
vesicle fusion or loss of internal contents of the liposomes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Masse et al. (2002) determined that the mouse and human NME4 genes
contain 5 exons and span about 3.5 kb. Their promoters, like those of
other NME genes, contain several binding sites for AP2 (107580), NF1
(613113), Sp1 (189906), LEF1 (153245), and response elements to
glucocorticoid receptors (138040). There are no TATA or CAAT boxes or
pyrimidine-rich initiator (Inr) sequences.

MAPPING

Milon et al. (1997) mapped the NME4 gene to 16p13.3 by analysis of
human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and by isotopic in situ hybridization.

600521	TITLE *600521 MANNAN-BINDING LECTIN SERINE PROTEASE 1; MASP1
;;MASP;;
COMPLEMENT-ACTIVATING COMPONENT OF Ra-REACTIVE FACTOR; CRARF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Ra-reactive factor (RARF) is a complement-dependent bactericidal
factor that binds to the Ra and R2 polysaccharides expressed by certain
enterobacteria. RARF activity is found in the sera of a diverse group of
vertebrates, suggesting that it is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism
to resist infection by these bacterial strains. RARF includes a 100-kD
component, CRARF, also called MASP1 or p100, that was thought to
activate the complement components C4 (C4F, 120820; C4S, 120810), C2
(613927), and C3 (120700). Subsequent work, however, separated MASP1
from MASP2 (605102) and showed that MASP1 activates C3 and C2, whereas
MASP2 activates C4 and C2. The other component of RARF is mannan-binding
lectin (154545), a plasma protein member of the complement system that
binds to microbial carbohydrates and activates the MASPs. The MASPs then
recruit C4 and C2 to generate the C3 convertase or directly activate C3.

CLONING

Takada et al. (1993) cloned a partial human CRARF cDNA from a liver
library. The human CRARF amino acid sequence is similar to the human
complement subcomponents C1R (613785) and C1S (120580). Takada et al.
(1995) obtained a corresponding mouse cDNA.

By RT-PCR with primers based on N-terminal peptide sequence analysis and
the consensus sequence of serine proteases, followed by screening a
fetal liver cDNA library, Sato et al. (1994) isolated a cDNA encoding
MASP. Sequence analysis predicted that the 699-amino acid protein
contains a leader peptide; 2 structural domains similar to those of C1R
and C1S; an EGF-like domain thought to be related to calcium-binding
activity; 2 short consensus repeat domains; and a serine protease
domain. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of 4.8- and 3.4-kb
MASP transcripts in fetal liver; no expression was detected in adult
tissues or in fetal heart, brain, lung, or kidney. Sato et al. (1994)
proposed that the MBL-MASP complex is a novel activator of complement in
what they designated the lectin pathway.

By biochemical purification of plasma proteins and immunoblot analysis,
Dahl et al. (2001) detected a 42-kD serine protease associated with MBL.
They identified a cDNA encoding this protein, MASP3, which is generated
by alternative splicing of MASP1. The MASP3 transcription product is
composed of an A chain, which is common to both MASP1 and MASP3, and a B
chain, which is unique to MASP3. The deduced 728-amino acid MASP3
protein has a signal peptide, 3 N-glycosylation sites on the B chain and
4 on the A chain.

Sirmaci et al. (2010) stated that the MASP1 gene encodes 3 isoforms; 2
isoforms (MASP1 and MASP3) contain different serine protease domains,
and the third (MAp44) lacks a serine protease domain.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Dobo et al. (2009) determined the crystal structure of the catalytic
region of MASP1 and refined it to 2.55-angstrom resolution. The
structure contains a salt bridge and a long 60-loop. The width of the
substrate-binding groove of MASP1 resembles trypsin (see 276000) rather
than early complement proteases.

GENE STRUCTURE

By analysis of genomic clones, Endo et al. (1996) found that the MASP1
catalytic domain is encoded by 6 exons. They proposed that the MASP1
gene is a prototype and that the intron-lacking sequences of C1S and C1R
have a more recent history.

Takayama et al. (1999) determined that the MASP1 gene spans over 67 kb.
It contains 10 exons encoding the nonprotease region of the protein, as
in the case of C1R and C1S, and 6 exons encoding the serine protease
region, in contrast to C1R and C1S, in which this region is encoded by a
single exon.

By PCR with degenerate primers and by genomic sequence analysis, Dahl et
al. (2001) determined that the unique MASP3 B chain is encoded by a
single exon followed by a poly-A region between the 10 exons encoding
the MASP1 A chain and the 6 exons encoding the MASP1 B chain.

MAPPING

Sato et al. (1994) mapped the MASP1 gene to 3q27-q28 by FISH. Using
FISH, Takada et al. (1995) mapped the human CRARF gene to 3q27-q28 and
the mouse gene to 16B2-B3, regions thought to share homology of synteny.

GENE FUNCTION

Matsushita et al. (2000) determined that MASP1 cleaves C3 and C2, while
MASP2 cleaves C4 and C2 to generate the C3 convertase, C4BC2B. Both
could be blocked by the C1 inhibitor (606860).

Rooryck et al. (2011) examined the effects of masp1 knockdown in
zebrafish and observed pigment and craniofacial cartilage defects
similar to those in colec11 (612502) morphants. Testing for epistasis by
injection of suboptimal doses (below which no phenotype is seen when
injected alone) of both colec11 and masp1 morpholinos into
single-cell-stage zebrafish embryos showed that approximately 73%
developed severe craniofacial abnormalities and some developed clefts in
the ethmoid plate. These results suggested that the COLEC11 and MASP1
gene products function in the same pathway.

Degn et al. (2012) found that the alternative complement pathway
functioned normally in a patient with 3MC syndrome (257290) and a
trp290-to-ter (W290X; 600521.0005) mutation in the MASP1 gene, causing
loss of the MASP1, MASP3, and MAp44 isoforms. Conversely, the patient
had a nonfunctional lectin pathway that could be restored by MASP1. Degn
et al. (2012) showed that MASP1 dramatically increased lectin pathway
activity through direct activation of MASP2. Both MASP1 and MASP2 could
associate in the same MBL complex, and this complex was present in human
serum. Degn et al. (2012) concluded that MASP1 and MASP2 act in a manner
analogous to C1R and C1S of the classical complement pathway.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 2 Turkish families segregating 3MC syndrome
mapping to chromosome 3q27 (3MC1; 257920), Sirmaci et al. (2010)
performed whole genome sequencing of candidate genes and identified
homozygosity for a missense and a nonsense mutation in the MASP1 gene
(600521.0004-600521.0005, respectively).

In 2 families with 3MC syndrome mapping to chromosome 3q27, Rooryck et
al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and identified 2 homozygous missense
mutations in the MASP1 gene (600521.0001 and 600521.0002, respectively).
Analysis of the MASP1 gene in 2 additional Brazilian 3MC families
revealed homozygosity for a third missense mutation in affected
individuals (600521.0003). The mutations all occurred at well-conserved
residues in exon 12 of the gene, segregated with the disorder in each
family, and were not found in at least 506 ethnically matched control
chromosomes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
3MC SYNDROME 1
MASP1, HIS497TYR

In an affected male patient from a consanguineous Greek family with 3MC
syndrome (3MC1; 257920), Rooryck et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for a 1489C-T transition in exon 12 of the MASP1 gene, resulting in a
his497-to-tyr (H497Y) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutated alleles segregated with the disorder in the family and the
mutation was not found in 572 northern European control chromosomes.

.0002
3MC SYNDROME 1
MASP1, CYS630ARG

In 2 affected brothers from an Italian family with 3MC syndrome, (3MC1;
257920), Rooryck et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 1888T-C
transition in exon 12 of the MASP1 gene, resulting in a cys630-to-arg
(C630R) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutated alleles
segregated with the disorder in the family and the mutation was not
found in 506 North European control chromosomes.

.0003
3MC SYNDROME 1
MASP1, GLY666GLU

In 3 affected individuals from 2 Brazilian families with 3MC syndrome,
(3MC1; 257920), previously reported by Leal and Baptista (2007) and Leal
et al. (2008), respectively, Rooryck et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a 1997G-A transition in exon 12 of the MASP1 gene,
resulting in a gly666-to-glu (G666E) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The mutated alleles segregated with the disorder in both
families and the mutation was not found in 506 North European control
chromosomes.

.0004
3MC SYNDROME 1
MASP1, GLY687ARG

In 2 Turkish sisters with 3MC1 syndrome (257920), the offspring of
first-cousin parents, Sirmaci et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for
a 2059G-A transition in the MASP1 gene, resulting in a gly687-to-arg
(G687R) substitution. The mutation occurred in an exon unique to the
MASP3 isoform. Both parents and an unaffected sib were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 2 healthy sibs or in 192 healthy
Turkish controls or 1,200 controls of various other ancestries.

.0005
3MC SYNDROME 1
MASP1, TRP290TER

In a 9-year-old Turkish female with 3MC1 syndrome (257920), the
offspring of first-cousin parents, Sirmaci et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for an 870G-A transition in the MASP1 gene, resulting in a
trp290-to-ter (W290X) substitution. The mutation occurred in coding exon
6, which is shared by all MASP1 isoforms. The mother and an unaffected
sister were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not detected in 192
healthy Turkish controls or 1,200 controls of various other ancestries.

Degn et al. (2012) confirmed that the 9-year-old Turkish girl with 3MC
syndrome and the W290X mutation lacked the MASP1, MASP3, and MAp44
isoforms encoded by the MASP1 gene. They found that the alternative
complement pathway functioned normally in the patient and was unaffected
by reconstitution of serum with MASP1 and MASP3. Conversely, the patient
had a nonfunctional lectin pathway that could be restored by MASP1.

271150	TITLE #271150 SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, TYPE IV; SMA4
;;SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, ADULT FORM;;
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, PROXIMAL, ADULT, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because autosomal recessive
adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy type IV (SMA4) is caused by mutation
or deletion in the SMN1 gene (600354).

Allelic disorders with overlapping phenotypes of differing severity and
age at onset include SMA type I (253300), SMA type II (253550), and SMA
type III (253400).

CLINICAL FEATURES

Pearn et al. (1978) described 9 patients from 6 families with
adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy. The median age at onset was 35
years, and the mean age at initial medical presentation was 37 years.
The condition was relatively benign, with symmetrical proximal muscle
involvement and preservation of the distal musculature. Family studies
suggested autosomal recessive inheritance.

Brahe et al. (1995) reported 6 patients from 4 families with autosomal
recessive adult-onset SMA. Age at onset ranged from 20 to 32 years, and
symptoms included tongue fasciculations, hand tremor, symmetrical
weakness of the proximal muscles that was more severe in the lower
limbs, and atrophy of the quadriceps muscle. Three patients had
bilateral hypertrophy of the calves. One patient was very mildly
affected; 3 patients had done military service, apparently without
problems. In a letter, Zerres et al. (1995) noted that they defined SMA
type IV as onset after age 30; patients with onset before age 30 years
who retained the ability to walk were defined as having SMA type III.

Clermont et al. (1995) reported a 73-year-old woman who developed type
IV SMA at age 47, with proximal muscle weakness, muscular atrophy, and
patellar areflexia. Three of her 5 children had SMA type II, and all
died before age 15 years. Molecular analysis showed that the mother had
deletion of SMN exons 7 and 8 on both chromosomes, but no DNA from the
children was available. Clermont et al. (1995) concluded that adult and
childhood SMA are allelic disorders, emphasizing the continuum of
clinical phenotypes caused by SMN gene mutations and deletions.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT

Weihl et al. (2006) reported increased quantitative muscle strength and
subjective function in 7 adult patients with SMA3/SMA4 who were treated
with oral valproate for a mean duration of 8 months. Most patients
reported improvement within a few months of beginning treatment. The
authors noted that previous studies (see Brichta et al., 2003) had
suggested that inhibitors of histone deacetylase, such as valproate, may
increase SMN2 gene transcription and result in increased production of
full-length SMN protein.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 patients with SMA4, Brahe et al. (1995) identified deletion of
exons 7 and 8 of the SMN1 gene, indicating that autosomal recessive
adult SMA is allelic to the childhood forms of SMA.

Mazzei et al. (2004) found evidence for a gene conversion event in SMN1
in 3 patients with SMA4, supporting the notion that a gene conversion
event is usually associated with a milder SMA phenotype and a later age
at disease onset.

- Modifying Factors

Wirth et al. (2006) analyzed SMN2 copy number in 115 patients with SMA3
or SMA4 who had confirmed homozygous absence of SMN1 and found that 62%
of SMA3 patients with age of onset less than 3 years had 2 or 3 SMN2
copies, whereas 65% of SMA3 patients with age of onset greater than 3
years had 4 to 5 SMN2 copies. Of the 4 adult-onset (SMA4) patients, 3
had 4 SMN2 copies and 1 had 6 copies. Wirth et al. (2006) concluded that
SMN2 may have a disease-modifying role in SMA, with a greater SMN2 copy
number associated with later onset and better prognosis.

- Heterogeneity

Hahnen et al. (1995) reported 4 patients with onset of SMA after age 30
who showed no homozygous deletion of exons 7 and 8 of the SMN1 gene,
suggesting genetic heterogeneity. However, the 4 patients with presumed
SMA IV had no family history, and spontaneous autosomal dominant
mutation at a different locus could not be excluded.

614026	TITLE *614026 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 26B; KIF26B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KIF26B belongs to the large kinesin family of intracellular motor
proteins. Kinesins transport organelles and other cargo along
microtubules and have a role in cell signaling (summary by Uchiyama et
al., 2010).

CLONING

Uchiyama et al. (2010) cloned mouse Kif26b, which encodes a 2,112-amino
acid protein that shares 87% identity with human KIF26B. Within the
N-terminal kinesin motor domain, the mouse and human proteins share 96%
identity. In situ hybridization of embryonic mice revealed Kif26b
expression in limb buds, metanephroi, and central nervous system. In
embryonic kidney, Kif26b was expressed in uncommitted mesenchyme, but
not in more differentiated structures, including renal vesicles and
comma-shaped bodies. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Kif26b
localized to the cytosol of mesenchymal cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Uchiyama et al. (2010) found that expression of Kif26b was downregulated
in Sall1 (602218)-null embryonic mouse metanephroi. They identified
multiple Sall1-binding sequences in the Kif26b promoter, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assays confirmed that Sall1 bound
and activated the Kif26b promoter. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and
pull-down assays showed that mouse Kif26b interacted with the nonmuscle
myosin Myh10 (160776).

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the KIF26B gene to chromosome 1q44 based on an
alignment of the KIF26B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK001019) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Uchiyama et al. (2010) found that Kif26b -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian frequency. However, Kif26b -/- mice died within 24
hours of birth with missing or underdeveloped kidneys, although other
organs appeared normal. Kif26b +/- mice were viable and fertile. In many
Kif26b -/- embryos, uretic buds failed to invade and branch into the
mesenchyme, resulting in disappearance of the kidney by embryonic day
14.5. Other Kif26b -/- embryos showed invasion of the uretic bud into
mesenchyme, but to a lesser extent than in wildtype mice. In Kif26b -/-
mesenchyme, expression of Gdnf (600837) was not maintained, and
expression of integrin alpha-8 (ITGA8; 604063) and basolateral
N-cadherin (CDH2; 114020) was reduced, suggesting both a failure in
uretic bud attraction and loss of basolateral integrity and cell-cell
adhesion. Uchiyama et al. (2010) proposed that lack of Kif26b in Kif26b
-/- cells may destabilize Myh10-mediated cell-cell adhesion in
developing kidney.

605523	TITLE *605523 TRANSDUCER OF ERBB2, 1; TOB1
;;TOB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Matsuda et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA encoding TOB1, which they called
TOB, a protein that interacts with the ERBB2 (164870) gene product p185.
Sequence analysis revealed that TOB1 is a 45-kD, 345-amino acid protein
whose N-terminal half is homologous to the antiproliferative gene
product BTG1 (109580). The C-terminal half of TOB1 is characterized by
the presence of a proline- and glutamine-rich sequence. Expression of
TOB1 mRNA was observed in various cell types.

GENE FUNCTION

Matsuda et al. (1996) found that, like BTG1, exogenously expressed TOB1
was able to suppress growth of NIH 3T3 cells, but the growth suppression
was hampered by the presence of kinase-active p185. By using GST-TOB1
proteins containing either full-length TOB1 or the N-terminal half of
TOB1, Matsuda et al. (1996) showed that the C-terminal half of TOB1 was
relevant to its interaction with p185. Furthermore, TOB1 could be
coimmunoprecipitated with anti-ERBB2 antibody, and reciprocally, p185
could be coimmunoprecipitated with anti-TOB1 antibodies. These data
suggested that p185 negatively regulates the TOB1-mediated
antiproliferative pathway through its interaction with TOB1, resulting
possibly in growth stimulation by p185. Expression of TOB1 mRNA was not
correlated with expression of ERBB2, suggesting that other receptor-type
protein-tyrosine kinases are also involved in the TOB1-mediated
regulation of cell growth.

Tzachanis et al. (2001) used antigen-specific T-cell clones rendered
anergic by stimulation of T-cell receptor (see 186810) in the absence of
costimulation or interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) and suppression subtractive
hybridization and differential screening to identify genes selectively
expressed in anergic cells. TOB was constitutively expressed in primary
peripheral blood T lymphocytes and had to be downregulated for T-cell
activation. Immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and gel-shift analyses
showed that TOB interacts with SMAD4 (MADH4; 600093) and, to a lesser
degree, with SMAD2 (601366) and augments SMAD DNA binding to sites in
the IL2 promoter, leading to an inhibition of IL2 transcription.
Tzachanis et al. (2001) concluded that T-cell quiescence is an actively
maintained phenotype that must be suppressed to allow T-cell activation
to occur, suggesting targets for the manipulation of the immune
response.

Xiong et al. (2006) found that zebrafish Tob1a was required for correct
dorsoventral patterning. Tob1a inhibited beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)
transcriptional activity by physically associating with beta-catenin and
preventing formation of beta-catenin/Lef1 (153245) complexes. Although
Tob1a also inhibited the transcriptional activity of Smad3 (603109), its
role in limiting dorsal development was executed primarily by
antagonizing the beta-catenin signal. By immunoprecipitation analysis,
Xiong et al. (2006) showed that endogenous TOB1 and beta-catenin
interacted in human HEK293T cells. SMAD3 also immunoprecipitated with
TOB1 in human cells.

MAPPING

By FISH, Matsuda et al. (1996) mapped the TOB1 gene to 17q21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yoshida et al. (2000) showed that murine Tob is a negative regulator of
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; see 112265)/SMAD signaling in
osteoblasts. Mice carrying a targeted deletion of the Tob gene had a
greater bone mass due to increased numbers of osteoblasts. Orthotopic
bone formation in response to Bmp2 (112261) was elevated in
Tob-deficient mice. Overproduction of Tob repressed Bmp2-induced,
Smad-mediated transcriptional activation. Tob associated with
receptor-regulated Smads, including Smad1 (601595), Smad5 (603110), and
Smad8 (603295), and colocalized with these SMADs in the nuclear bodies
upon BMP2 stimulation. The results indicated that Tob negatively
regulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation by suppressing
the activity of the receptor-regulated Smad proteins.

611279	TITLE *611279 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 14; KIF14
;;KIAA0042
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KIF14 is a member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule-associated
motors (see 148760) that play important roles in intracellular transport
and cell division (Nakagawa et al., 1997).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated myeloid cell line
cDNA library, Nomura et al. (1994) cloned KIF14, which they designated
KIAA0042. The 1,648-amino acid protein contains an ATP/GTP-binding site
motif. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected weak expression
in thymus only. The 3-prime untranslated region of the KIF14 mRNA
contains an Alu repeat. Nakagawa et al. (1997) cloned mouse Kif14.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected Kif14 expression in
brain and kidney.

Carleton et al. (2006) used PCR to amplify the human KIF14 open reading
frame from KIAA0042. The deduced KIF14 protein contains an internal
motor domain with a conserved catalytic core, an N-type conserved neck
region, a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, and 4 coiled-coil domains.
Immunofluorescence microscopy localized KIF14 throughout the cell cycle
in 293T cells and HeLa cells. During interphase, KIF14 localized to the
cytoplasm and was redistributed to the nucleus upon entry into mitosis.
From prophase to metaphase, KIF14 localized at developing spindle poles
and associated microtubules, and during anaphase, KIF14 accumulated at
the spindle midzone, where it concentrated during telophase. KIF14
localized to the contractile ring in cells ready to undergo abscission.

Using real-time PCR, Corson et al. (2005) found that KIF14 expression
was high in placenta and in fetal tissues, notably liver and thymus, and
very low in the majority of normal adult tissues.

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF14 belongs to the
kinesin-3 family.

GENE FUNCTION

Carleton et al. (2006) showed that the KIF14 internal motor domain has
microtubule-dependent ATPase activity. Using microarray profiling of
KIF14 expression in synchronized HCT116 cells, they demonstrated cell
cycle-dependent KIF14 expression that increased in mitotic cells through
G2/M. RNAi knockdown of KIF14 showed several distinct phenotypes with
hypoploidy observed at less than 50% KIF14 mRNA depletion and a
hyperploid (tetraploid and polyploid) phenotype detected in cells with
80% or greater KIF14 mRNA depletion. KIF14-silenced cells demonstrated a
reduction in the concentration of KIF14 at the midbody of late-stage
mitotic cells and inability of these cells to complete cytokinesis.
Carleton et al. (2006) concluded that depletion of KIF14 disrupted cell
cycle progression and induced cytokinesis failure.

Gruneberg et al. (2006) showed that KIF14 copurified in a complex with
PRC1 (603484), KIF4 (300521), MKLP1 (KIF23; 605064), and MKLP2 (KIF20A;
605664). KIF14 localization to the central spindle and midbody was
dependent upon the presence of PRC1, and the N-terminal amino acids 1 to
356, containing the central spindle-targeting signal, were responsible
for binding to PRC1. Using siRNA knockdown of KIF14 mRNA, they
demonstrated that KIF14-depleted cells showed loss of specific
localization of citron kinase (STK21; 605629) to the central spindle and
cleavage furrow region. Immunoprecipitation studies showed citron kinase
interaction with PRC1 and KIF14 specifically but not with other mitotic
kinases. Further studies in cells cotransfected with KIF14 and citron
kinase showed that the C-terminal amino acids 901 to 1649 of KIF14
specifically interacted with the kinase-dead form of citron kinase.

Gain of chromosome 1q31-q32 is seen in over 50% of retinoblastomas and
is common in other tumors. Corson et al. (2005) found that, of the most
frequently gained sequence-tagged sites at 1q32.1, only KIF14 was
overexpressed in various cancers by real-time RT-PCR. KIF14 mRNA was
expressed in 20 of 22 retinoblastomas at levels 100- to 1,000-fold
higher than normal retina, and 10 retinoblastoma cell lines had higher
KIF14 levels than 12 tumors. Relative to normal tissues and cells, KIF14
was overexpressed in the majority of breast cancer and medulloblastoma
cell lines, and primary lung tumors. Patients with lung tumors that
overexpressed KIF14 showed a trend toward decreased survival.

MAPPING

Using a somatic cell hybrid panel, Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the KIF14
gene to chromosome 1. Gruneberg et al. (2006) noted that KIF14 maps to
chromosome 1q31-q32.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATP2C1 is a Golgi-localized ATPase that mediates Golgi uptake of
cytosolic Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) and has a role in regulating Ca(2+) and
Mn(2+) cellular content (Ton et al., 2002).

CLONING

Hu et al. (2000) identified an EST corresponding to the ATP2C1 gene
within a 1.3-Mb YAC/BAC contig spanning the region of chromosome
3q21-q24 deleted in a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600).
This EST had been annotated as homologous to a yeast gene encoding a
calcium ATPase with a function predicted to be related to that of SERCA2
(ATP2A2; 108740). Hu et al. (2000) isolated the full-length cDNA
corresponding to the human EST. Similar to other Ca(2+) ATPase genes,
the ATP2C1 gene encodes 2 alternatively spliced transcripts, ATP2C1a and
ATP2C1b. These transcripts differed in their C termini (encoding amino
acids 877 to the end), but had the same expression patterns in all
tissues examined. ATP2C1a was predicted to encode 919 amino acids, and
ATP2C1b was predicted to encode 888 amino acids. The protein encoded by
ATP2C1 was highly homologous (97% identity) to rat Pmr1, which in turn
is homologous to the yeast calcium pump Pmr1, but less homologous to
other calcium pumps. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb ATP2C1
transcript in keratinocytes and in all 12 whole tissues examined.
Highest expression was in kidney and heart, and lowest expression was in
colon, thymus, and leukocytes. Patients with HHD are not known to have
extracutaneous manifestations of the disease. Hu et al. (2000) found no
differences in ATP2C1 mRNA levels between skin taken from the axilla and
skin from the buttock (sites particularly prone vs resistant to
blistering, respectively, in HHD patients) of one normal individual and
little change in ATP2C1 mRNA levels in normal human epidermal
keratinocytes cultured with glucocorticoid.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ATP2C1 clone, which they designated
KIAA1347. The deduced 918-amino acid protein shares 97% identity with
its rat ortholog, a calcium-transporting ATPase. RT-PCR ELISA detected
variable ATP2C1 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with
highest expression in ovary, followed by lung, testis, brain, liver, and
kidney. Within specific adult brain regions, highest expression was
detected in thalamus, followed by amygdala and substantia nigra.

Ton et al. (2002) showed that epitope-tagged human SPCA1 localized to
the Golgi compartment following expression in yeast and Chinese hamster
ovary cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hu et al. (2000) detected 27 exons in the ATP2C1 gene. Dobson-Stone et
al. (2002) detected 28 translated exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1
gene to chromosome 3. Hu et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1 gene to
chromosome 3q21-q24.

GENE FUNCTION

Pmr1, the yeast ortholog of SPCA1, is expressed in the Golgi compartment
and functions as a high-affinity Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) pump involved in Ca(2+)
and Mn(2+) secretion. Deletion of Pmr1 in yeast causes hypersensitivity
to Ca(2+) chelators and Mn(2+) toxicity, with defects in protein
glycosylation, processing, sorting, and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-related glycosylation. Ton et al. (2002) found that heterologous
expression of human SPCA1, but not SERCA-type Ca(2+)-transporting
ATPases, reduced Mn(2+) toxicity and complemented Ca(2+)-related
phenotypes in Pmr1-null yeast. Yeast Golgi vesicles expressing human
SPCA1 showed high-affinity Ca(2+) transport activity that was
inhibitable by Mn(2+), but not by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of
SERCA-type ATPases. Ton et al. (2002) proposed that SPCA1 plays a role
in maintaining Ca(2+) and Mn(2+) concentrations in Golgi and the
secretory pathway.

Using RNA interference with HeLa cells, Van Baelen et al. (2003) showed
that SPCA1 was completely responsible for thapsigargin-insensitive
Ca(2+) uptake into Golgi vesicles. Knockdown of SPCA1 did not alter
Ca(2+) handling in the ER and had only a small effect on baseline
histamine-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in whole cells.

Mukhopadhyay and Linstedt (2011) found that exposure of HeLa cells to
increased extracellular Mn(2+), but not Ca(2+), induced trafficking of
the Golgi phosphoprotein GPP130 (GOLIM4; 606805) from the Golgi to
multivesicular bodies and then to lysosomes, followed by GPP130
degradation. They showed that a gln747-to-ala (Q747A) point mutation in
SPCA1 increased Golgi uptake of cellular Mn(2+), leading to increased
GPP130 degradation and reduced Mn(2+) toxicity via secretion. In
contrast, SPCA1 containing either an asp350-to-ala (D350A) mutation,
which blocks autophosphorylation and transport of Mn(2+) and Ca(2+), or
a gly309-to-cys (G309C) mutation, which blocks transport of Mn(2+), but
not Ca(2+), reduced Golgi uptake of Mn(2+), resulting in reduced GPP130
degradation and increased Mn(2+) toxicity.

Kourtis et al. (2012) demonstrated that heat stroke triggers pervasive
necrotic cell death and neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Preconditioning
of animals at a mildly elevated temperature strongly protected from
heat-induced necrosis. The heat-shock transcription factor HSF1 (140580)
and the small heat-shock protein HSP-16.1 mediate cytoprotection by
preconditioning. HSP-16.1 localizes to the Golgi, where it functions
with the calcium- and magnesium-transporting ATPase PMR1 to maintain
calcium homeostasis under heat stroke. Preconditioning also suppresses
cell death inflicted by diverse insults, and protects mammalian neurons
from heat cytotoxicity. Kourtis et al. (2012) concluded that their
findings revealed an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that defends
against diverse necrotic stimuli. In mouse cortical neurons and striatal
cells, Kourtis et al. (2012) found that overexpression of crystallin
alpha-A (123580), which colocalizes with the Golgi marker
alpha-mannosidase-II (154582) and the PMR1 ATPase, was sufficient to
protect mammalian neurons from heat stroke-induced death, even in the
absence of preconditioning. Heat stroke caused massive necrotic death
and axonal degeneration in neurons expressing short hairpin RNAs against
Pmr1, even after preconditioning.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by persistent blisters and erosions of the skin. By family
linkage studies, the HHD region was localized to 3q21-q24. Study of a
family carrying a deletion helped narrow the location. To screen HHD
patients for ATP2C1 mutations, Hu et al. (2000) identified intron sites
by comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences, designed primers flanking
the 27 identified exons, and assessed PCR products from patients and
controls by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or
conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) analyses. Among 51
unrelated kindreds of European descent and 10 of Japanese descent, they
identified 21 abnormalities (16/51 and 5/10). Of the abnormal sequences,
6 predicted single amino acid substitutions, 2 predicted aberrant
splicing, and 13 predicted prematurely truncated products through
frameshifts or single-basepair substitution. A high frequency of the
last type of mutation supported a haploinsufficiency pathogenesis
consistent with the complete deletion of the gene in 1 kindred and
further suggested that calcium pumps of the PMR1 family function as
monomers. The mechanism by which mutant ATPC1 causes acantholysis is
unknown, but it may be through abnormally elevated cytoplasmic calcium
or abnormally low Golgi Ca(2+) levels. Elevated cytoplasmic calcium
might act by altering posttranslational modification of proteins or by
inducing changes in gene expression.

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified 13 different mutations, including
nonsense, frameshift insertion and deletions, splice-site mutations, and
nonconservative missense mutations, in ATP2C1 in patients with
Hailey-Hailey disease. The identification of ATP2A2 as the gene
defective in Darier disease (124200) provided further evidence of the
critical role of Ca(2+) signaling in maintaining epidermal integrity.

Ikeda et al. (2001) reported ATP2C1 mutations in 11 Japanese patients
with Hailey-Hailey disease. Some affected individuals had unique
clinical features (generalization of Hailey-Hailey disease and
generalized skin eruption resembling keratotic papules in Darier
disease), but other affected individuals did not, suggesting the
presence of intrafamilial phenotypic variations. These findings
reinforced the conclusion that differences in clinical phenotypes in
Hailey-Hailey disease are probably related to factors other than the
type of causative mutation.

Chao et al. (2002) identified 7 different ATP2C1 mutations, 6 of them
novel, in 7 Taiwanese kindreds with Hailey-Hailey disease. They found 3
deletion mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, 1 missense mutation, and 1
splicing mutation.

Dobson-Stone et al. (2002) screened all 28 translated exons of ATP2C1 in
24 Hailey-Hailey disease families and 3 sporadic cases and identified 22
mutations (18 novel) in 25 probands. The novel mutations comprised 3
nonsense, 6 insertion/deletion, 3 splice site, and 6 missense mutations,
and were distributed throughout the ATP2C1 gene. They noted that 6 of
the mutations were found in multiple families in their study as well as
in the studies of Sudbrak et al. (2000) and Hu et al. (2000). Haplotype
analysis revealed that 2 of these were recurrent mutations. Comparison
between genotype and phenotype in 23 families failed to yield any clear
correlation between the nature of the mutation and clinical features of
Hailey-Hailey disease. The extensive inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic
variability suggested that modifying genes and/or environmental factors
may greatly influence the clinical features of this disease.

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease, Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a
splice site mutation in exon 22 of the ATP2C1 gene (604384.0009).
Haplotype analysis of the more severely affected segmental skin regions
revealed consistent loss of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the
authors' hypothesis that such segmental exacerbations represent a form
of mosaicism with hemizygosity for the mutation.

HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, 4-BP INS, 767CCCT

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000) found
a 4-bp insertion after nucleotide 767 in exon 10 of the ATP2C1 gene. The
insertion resulted in a frameshift with a premature termination codon 42
amino acids downstream of the mutation.

.0002
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, ALA304THR

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000)
identified a G-to-T transversion of nucleotide 910 of the ATP2C1 gene,
resulting in an ala304-to-thr amino acid substitution.

.0003
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, ARG468TER

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000) found
a 1402C-T transition in the ATP2C1 gene that altered codon 468 from
arginine to stop.

.0004
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, 4-BP DEL, 2374TTTG

In 2 unrelated families with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al.
(2000) found an identical 4-bp deletion of 2374delTTTG in the ATP2C1
gene. The 2 families had different alleles of the D3S1587 marker, a
locus less than 100 kb from the mutant gene, on the mutant chromosome.
This may indicate that these were independent mutations. The deletion
resulted in a premature termination codon 10 amino acids downstream of
the mutation.

.0005
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, IVS11, G-A, -1

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified a G-to-A transition at the 3-prime end
of intron 11 (nucleotide position 852) of the ATP2C1 gene in a family
with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600). The effect on the cDNA was not
determined.

HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, CYS490PHE

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a
cys490-to-phe (C490F) amino acid substitution that arose from a 1469G-T
transversion in exon 17 of the ATP2C1 gene.

.0007
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, 1-BP DEL, 2460G

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a

premature termination codon at exon 25.

.0008
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, LEU584PRO

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a T-to-C
transition at nucleotide 1751 in exon 19 of the ATP2C1 gene, resulting
in a leu584-to-pro (L584P) amino acid substitution.

.0009
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, IVS22, G-A, +1

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease (169600), originally reported by Vakilzadeh and Kolde (1985),
Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the first base of the consensus splice donor site of exon
22 of the ATP2C1 gene. The mutation, which they designated 2146+1G-A,
resulted in the skipping of the 69-bp exon 22. Haplotype analysis of the
more severely affected segmental skin regions revealed consistent loss
of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the authors' hypothesis that
such segmental exacerbations represent a form of mosaicism with
hemizygosity for the mutation.

601581	TITLE *601581 NEURONAL CELL ADHESION MOLECULE; NRCAM
;;KIAA0343
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are a subset of the immunoglobin (Ig)
superfamily found in the nervous systems of both vertebrates and
invertebrates. They are usually surface membrane proteins with multiple
Ig domains at their N termini followed by several fibronectin type III
repeats and either a transmembrane intracellular domain or a
glycophosphatidylinositol-linked membrane anchor at the C terminus (Lane
et al., 1996).

CLONING

The chicken Bravo/Nr-CAM was described by Grumet et al. (1991) and
Kayyem et al. (1992) and shown to play a role in nervous system
development. The protein interacts with other cell surface molecules of
the Ig superfamily and appears to be necessary for specific pathfinding
by axonal growth cones during development (Lane et al., 1996). Lane et
al. (1996) cloned the human homolog (NRCAM) of the chicken gene from a
fetal brain library. Like its chicken counterpart, the predicted
1,275-amino acid protein has 6 V-like Ig domains and 5 fibronectin type
III repeats. The transmembrane and intracellular domains of human and
chicken NRCAM are entirely conserved and the proteins are 82% identical
overall. Alternative splice variants were observed involving sequence
around the fifth fibronectin repeat. Northern blots showed an
approximately 7-kb transcript in all tissues of adult human brain
examined.

Wang et al. (1998) found expression of a 7.0-kb NRCAM transcript at
highest levels in brain, adrenal medulla, and adrenal cortex and at
intermediate levels in placenta, pancreas, thyroid, and testis. In a PCR
survey of splice variants in fetal and adult tissues, they found spatial
and temporal variations in the exons utilized. They noted that this
phenomenon is conserved in the chick NrCAM and has been observed in
other related CAMs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dry et al. (2001) determined that the NRCAM gene contains 34 exons
spanning over 316 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lane et al. (1996) mapped the
NRCAM gene to 7q31.1-q31.2. By radiation hybrid analysis, Wang et al.
(1998) mapped the NRCAM gene close to marker D7S666, which Dry et al.
(2001) noted is located at 7q31.

614259	TITLE *614259 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 65; WDR65
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis and PCR of human and mouse testis cDNA libraries,
Rorick et al. (2011) cloned 2 splice variants of human and mouse WDR65.
The deduced full-length human protein contains 1,283 amino acids and has
2 WD repeat domains. The shorter human variant encodes a deduced
698-amino acid protein that is truncated after the 2 WD repeat domains.
PCR analysis of mouse tissues revealed highest Wdr65 expression in lung,
testis, and skin. Weaker expression was detected in brain and kidney,
and no expression was detected in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and
spleen. Wdr65 was expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells and in whole
mouse embryos beginning at about 15 days postcoitum. In situ
hybridization revealed Wdr65 expression in mouse nasal epithelium and
medial edge epithelium at 14.5 days postcoitum, and in nasal respiratory
epithelium and epidermis, but not oral epithelium, at 15.5 days
postcoitum. The increase in Wdr65 expression in these embryonic mouse
craniofacial tissues correlated with development and dissolution of the
epithelial seam.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rorick et al. (2011) determined that the WDR65 gene contains 24 exons.

Rorick et al. (2011) reported that the WDR65 gene maps to chromosome
1p34.2. The mouse Wdr65 gene maps to a region of chromosome 4 that
shares homology of synteny with human chromosome 1p36-p32.

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray analysis, Rorick et al. (2011) showed that expression
of Wdr65 was significantly downregulated in Irf6 (607199)-deficient
mouse embryos compared with wildtype embryos. Database analysis revealed
an IRF6-binding site for WDR65 in an exon of the EBNA1BP2 gene (614443),
which is located 63 bp upstream of WDR65 on the opposite strand.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Brazilian patient with van der Woude syndrome (606713), Rorick et
al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a possibly causative missense
mutation at a conserved residue in the WDR65 gene (614259.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
WDR65, ASP523TYR

This variant, formerly titled VAN DER WOUDE SYNDROME 2 (606713), has
been reclassified because its contribution to the phenotype has not been
confirmed.

In a Brazilian patient with van der Woude syndrome-2, Rorick et al.
(2011) identified a heterozygous 1567G-T transversion in exon 10 of the
WDR65 gene, resulting in an asp523-to-tyr (D523Y) substitution at a
conserved residue. Because the mutation was not found in controls and
significantly changes the biochemical properties of a conserved residue,
Rorick et al. (2011) concluded that it was potentially etiologic.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Through study of submicroscopic deletions in 2 unrelated patients with
familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP; 175100), Joslyn et al. (1991)
found 3 genes in a 100-kb deleted segment on chromosome 5. MCC (159350),
a previous candidate gene, was shown to be located outside the deleted
region. One of the new genes contained a sequence identical to SRP19
(182175). The second gene, provisionally designated DP1, was transcribed
in the same orientation as MCC. Two other cDNAs, DP2 and DP3, were found
to overlap, forming a single gene, DP2.5, which was transcribed in the
same orientation as SRP19. The DP2.5 gene was shown by Groden et al.
(1991) to be the polyposis gene, as indicated in 611731.

Transport of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cell surface
membrane is critical for receptor-ligand recognition. However, mammalian
GPCR odorant receptors (ORs), when heterologously expressed in cells,
are poorly expressed on the cell surface. By screening for genes that
induced cell surface expression of ORs expressed in human embryonic
kidney cells, Saito et al. (2004) identified mouse and human REEP1
(609139). They searched databases for homologs of REEP1 and identified
several other REEP genes, including DP1, which they called REEP5. In
situ hybridization of mouse olfactory epithelium revealed that, unlike
Reep1, Reep5 was not expressed in olfactory neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an in vitro system to identify Xenopus membrane proteins involved
in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network formation, followed by
localization, overexpression, and deletion experiments in mammalian and
yeast cells, Voeltz et al. (2006) identified the reticulons,
particularly Rtn4a/NogoA (604475), and the reticulon-interacting protein
DP1/Yop1 as the major components shaping the tubular ER.

MAPPING

Joslyn et al. (1991) identified the DP1 gene in a 100-kb segment on
chromosome 5 deleted in 2 patients with APC.

FLJ22693 (PARP12) and ZAP (ZC3HAV1; 607312), that encode deduced
proteins with the same conserved regions: a WWE domain, a PARP-like
domain, and a TPH domain. The N-terminal region of the TPH domain in all
3 genes contains a CCCH-type zinc finger. Katoh and Katoh (2003) noted
that PARP12 and ZCH3HAV1 share 27.5% and 26% overall amino acid sequence

605541	TITLE *605541 VAV3 ONCOGENE; VAV3
;;ONCOGENE VAV3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the VAV family, such as VAV3, are guanine nucleotide exchange
factors (GEFs) for Rho (see 165390) and Rac (see 602048) family GTPases.
Upon cell stimulation, VAV proteins become rapidly and transiently
phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, leading to activation of their
GDP-GTP exchange activity towards Rho/Rac proteins. VAV proteins are an
essential and direct link between receptors with intrinsic or associated
tyrosine kinase activity and the mitogenic and cytoskeletal pathways
regulated by Rho/Rac proteins (review by Bustelo, 2000).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences corresponding with fragments of
VAV1 (164875) and VAV2 (600428), followed by screening a placenta cDNA
library, Movilla and Bustelo (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding VAV3. The
predicted 847-amino acid protein shares approximately 69% and 66%
sequence similarity with VAV1 and VAV2, respectively. It contains Dbl
homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology domains, common in Rho and Rac
GEFs, as well as a calponin homology (CH) region, an acidic motif, a
zinc finger (ZF) domain, 2 SH3 regions, and 1 SH2 domain, like the other
VAVs. Northern and dot blot analyses revealed variable but wide
expression of a 5-kb transcript, with highest levels in peripheral blood
lymphocytes, spleen, and brain, and lower levels in thymus, heart,
kidney, liver, placenta, and lung.

Trenkle et al. (2000) identified a splice variant of VAV3, which they
termed VAV3.1, that encodes a VAV3 isoform containing only the
C-terminal SH3-SH2-SH3 region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoblot analysis, Movilla and Bustelo (1999) found that VAV3
displayed low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in nonstimulated cells,
but became rapidly phosphorylated upon T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880)
or epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530) receptor (131550) activation.
Analysis of enzymatic activity showed that VAV3 acted as a GEF
preferentially on RhoG (ARHG; 179505), RhoA (ARHA; 165390), and, to a
lesser extent, RAC1 (602048), and it associated maximally with these
GTPases in the nucleotide-free state. In contrast to VAV1 and VAV2,
neither full-length nor truncated versions of VAV3 induced cellular
transformation either alone or in combination with a mutant protein
tyrosine kinase, LCK (153390). On the other hand, confocal microscopy
analysis showed that expression of truncated VAV3 lacking the CH domain
or the CH and SH3/SH2 domains, but containing active DH and ZF domains,
led to extensive lamellipodia, membrane ruffling, and the formation of
an actomyosin ring, similar to the changes elicited by VAV1 and VAV2.
These truncated proteins were expressed predominantly in the perinuclear
area and along stress fibers, membrane ruffles, and the plasma membrane
of nonmitotic fibroblasts, colocalizing with F-actin (see ACTA1;
102610). Microscopic analysis also showed that the truncated VAV3
proteins, particularly those with the N-terminal CH deletion, but not
VAV1 or the LBC oncogene (604686), induced defects in cytokinesis and
the generation of polynucleated cells.

Moores et al. (2000) expressed VAV1, VAV2, and VAV3 at equivalent levels
and found that each responded to similar surface receptor tyrosine
kinases. Integrin-induced phosphorylation required the presence of SYK
(600085). Only VAV1 could efficiently cooperate with TCR signaling to
enhance NFAT (600489)-dependent transcription, while only VAV1 and VAV3
could enhance nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011)-dependent
transcription.

Trenkle et al. (2000) found that the VAV3.1 splice variant appeared to
be downregulated by EGF and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB;
190180).

Bustelo (2000) presented a comprehensive review of the regulatory and
signaling properties of the VAV family.

MAPPING

Bustelo (2000) stated that the VAV3 gene maps to chromosome 1 (TMAP
stSG3811).

ANIMAL MODEL

Faccio et al. (2005) generated Vav3 -/- mice and observed increased bone
density and protection from bone loss induced by systemic bone
resorption stimuli. Vav3-deficient osteoclasts showed defective actin
cytoskeleton organization, polarization, spreading, and resorptive
activity. Diminished Vav3 phosphorylation was observed in
protein-tyrosine kinase (SYK; 600085)-deficient preosteoclasts in vitro.
Vav3 +/- Syk +/- mice had increased bone mass, and Vav3 +/- Syk +/-
osteoclasts did not resorb bone in vitro. Faccio et al. (2005) concluded
that VAV3 is essential for stimulated osteoclast activation and bone
density in vivo, and that SYK is a crucial upstream regulator of VAV3 in
osteoclasts.

Sauzeau et al. (2006) found that Vav3-deficient mice demonstrated
tachycardia, systemic arterial hypertension, and extensive
cardiovascular remodeling consistent with hypertension by 4 months of
age. Further analysis showed activation of the renin (REN;
179820)-angiotensin (see 106150) system, which was confirmed by
pharmacologic studies, and hyperactivity of sympathetic neurons with
high catecholamine levels. The mice showed a resultant progressive loss
of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis.

Sindrilaru et al. (2009) observed impaired wound closure in Vav3 -/-
mice, but not in Vav1 -/- or Vav2 -/- mice. Delayed wound healing in
Vav3 -/- mice was associated with diminished numbers of macrophages,
myofibroblasts, and blood vessels. Recruitment of polymorphonuclear
neutrophils (PMNs) to the wound site was normal. After clearing wounds
of invading pathogens, PMNs normally undergo apoptosis and are removed
by macrophages by adhesion-dependent phagocytosis. Macrophages then
release activated TGF-beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180), which initiates
myofibroblast differentiation, followed by myofibroblast-driven wound
contraction and neoangiogenesis. Wounds of Vav3 -/- mice showed
defective beta-2 integrin (ITGB2; 600065)-dependent adhesion between
apoptotic PMNs and macrophages and defective release of active
Tgf-beta-1 from macrophages. Local injection of either Vav3-competent
macrophages or recombinant human TGF-beta-1 into wounds of Vav3 -/- mice
fully rescued wound healing. Sindrilaru et al. (2009) concluded that
VAV3 is critical for formation of the phagocytic synapse between
macrophages and PMNs and initiation of wound repair.

;;KINETOCHORE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; KNTC2;;
HIGHLY EXPRESSED IN CANCER; HEC;;
HEC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HEC is one of several proteins involved in spindle checkpoint signaling.
This surveillance mechanism assures correct segregation of chromosomes
during cell division by detecting unaligned chromosomes and causing
prometaphase arrest until the proper bipolar attachment of chromosomes
is achieved.

CLONING

Durfee et al. (1993) cloned a fragment of HEC in a yeast 2-hybrid screen
of a human B-cell cDNA library using the C terminus of the
retinoblastoma protein (RB1; 614041) as bait. Chen et al. (1997)
screened a B-cell cDNA library using this fragment as probe and isolated
a full-length cDNA encoding HEC. The deduced 642-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 72 kD. HEC has a series of typical
leucine heptad repeats that covers the last two-thirds of its sequence.
Northern blot analysis revealed a 2.3-kb mRNA in all cell lines tested.
Tumor cell lines expressed HEC more abundantly than did normal tissues
and untransformed cells. Northern blot analysis of synchronized CV1
monkey kidney cells showed highest expression during S and M phases.
Western blot analysis of several normal tissues indicated expression of
HEC in tissues with high mitotic indices, such as testis, spleen, and
thymus. Western blot analysis of human bladder carcinoma cells confirmed
expression of a 76-kD protein only in the late S to M phases.
Immunolocalization of HEC in bladder carcinoma cells showed a speckled
nuclear localization in G1-phase cells, and both perinuclear and nuclear
staining in S-phase cells. Staining of metaphase chromosome spreads
revealed colocalization with centromeric proteins (see 117140).

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (1997) microinjected antibody directed against HEC to
inactivate endogenous HEC in synchronized human bladder carcinoma cells.
Microinjected cells contained multiple, fragmented nuclei. Chromosomes
condensed but failed to coalesce or segregate properly. No distinct
metaphase plates were observed, and spindles were disorganized in
relation to their centromeres. Cells injected with anti-HEC antibodies
were able to undergo cytokinesis, but chromosomes separated haphazardly
into grossly abnormal daughter cells that were ultimately nonviable.

Using gene silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfected into
HeLa S3 cells, Martin Lluesma et al. (2002) found that, in the absence
of HEC1, neither of the spindle assembly checkpoint components, MAD1
(602686) and MAD2 (601467), could be detected on kinetochores by
immunofluorescence microscopy. The kinetochore associations of MPS1 (see
604092) and BUB1 (602452) were also eliminated or reduced, respectively.
Further investigation revealed that HEC1 was required for the
kinetochore association of MPS1, and both HEC1 and MPS1 were required
for recruiting the MAD1-MAD2 complex.

Following overexpression of MIS12 (609178) in HeLa cells, Obuse et al.
(2004) immunoprecipitated HEC1 and several other proteins that
interacted with MIS12 in a kinetochore-associated complex. Liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry indicated that the interaction
between MIS12 and HEC1 was direct.

DeLuca et al. (2006) found that antibody directed to the N terminus of
Hec1 suppressed microtubule detachment and microtubule plus-end
polymerization and depolymerization at kinetochores in PtK potoroo
kidney cells. Centromeres became hyperstretched, kinetochore fibers
shortened from spindle poles, kinetochore microtubule attachment errors
increased, and chromosomes missegregated. The N terminus of Hec1 was
phosphorylated by Aurora B kinase (AURKB; 604970) in vitro, and cells
expressing N-terminal nonphosphorylatable Hec1 mutants exhibited
increased merotelic attachments, hyperstretching of centromeres, and
errors in chromosome segregation. DeLuca et al. (2006) concluded that
the HEC1 N terminus controls the dynamic behavior of kinetochore
microtubules.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Alushin et al. (2010) presented a subnanometer-resolution cryoelectron
microscopy reconstruction of the human NDC80 complex bound to
microtubules, sufficient for precise docking of crystal structures of
the component proteins. Alushin et al. (2010) found that the NDC80
complex binds the microtubule with a tubulin monomer repeat, recognizing
alpha- and beta-tubulin at both intra- and intertubulin dimer interfaces
in a manner that is sensitive to tubulin conformation. Furthermore,
NDC80 complexes self-associate along protofilaments through interactions
mediated by the N-terminal tail of the NDC80 protein, which is the site
of phosphoregulation by Aurora B kinase. Alushin et al. (2010) suggested
a mechanism by which Aurora B could regulate the stability of
load-bearing kinetochore-microtubule attachments.

MAPPING

Hartz (2005) mapped the KNTC2 gene to chromosome 18p11.32 based on an
alignment of the KNTC2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF017790) with the
genomic sequence.

;;ACTIVIN A RECEPTOR, TYPE II-LIKE KINASE 3; ACVRLK3;;
ACTIVIN RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 3; ALK3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

See ACVRL1 (601284). Human cDNA clones encoding 4 putative transmembrane
ser/thr kinases were identified by ten Dijke et al. (1993). Using
degenerate DNA primers based on the human activin receptor type II (see
102581) and C. elegans Daf-1 gene products, they PCR-amplified mRNA from
human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, a cell type known to respond both to
activin (147290) and TGF-beta (190180). The ALK3 gene encodes a
532-amino acid polypeptide that shares similar sequence and domain
structures with the other 3 ALK genes they cloned. ALK1, ALK2 (102576),
ALK3, and ALK4 (601300) share approximately 40% sequence identity with
activin receptors type II and IIB, TGF-beta receptor (see 190181), and
Daf-1 in their kinase domains but share 60 to 79% sequence identity
among themselves, suggesting to ten Dijke et al. (1993) that the ALK
gene products form a subfamily of receptor ser/thr kinases. By Northern
analysis, ten Dijke et al. (1993) showed that ALK3 was expressed almost
exclusively in human skeletal muscle with weak expression in heart and
placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Eng (2001) pointed out that the TGF-beta/BMP superfamily of molecules
has been shown to be defective not only in neoplasia but also in the
noncancer developmental syndromes primary pulmonary hypertension
(178600) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT1, 187300; HHT2,
600376).

Elimination of the developing female reproductive tract in male fetuses
is an essential step in mammalian sexual differentiation. In males, the
fetal testis produces anti-mullerian hormone (AMH; 600957), which causes
regression of the mullerian ducts, the primordia of the oviducts,
uterus, and upper vagina. AMH induces regression by binding to a
specific type II receptor (AMHR2; 600956). Mutations in AMH or AMHR2 in
humans and mice disrupt signaling, producing male pseudohermaphrodites
that possess oviducts and uteri. Jamin et al. (2002) showed that
targeted disruption of the BMPR1A receptor protein in the mesenchymal
cells of the mullerian ducts leads to retention of oviducts and uteri in
males. These results identified BMPR1A as a type I receptor for
AMH-induced regression of mullerian ducts. Because BMPR1A is
evolutionarily conserved, these findings indicate that a component of
the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway has been co-opted
during evolution for male sexual development in amniotes.

In humans, mutations in the BMPR1A, SMAD4 (600993), and PTEN (601728)
genes are responsible for juvenile polyposis syndrome, juvenile
intestinal polyposis, and Cowden disease (CD; 158350), respectively. The
development of polyposis is a common feature of these disorders,
suggesting that there is an association between the BMP and PTEN
pathways. To determine the mechanistic link between the 2 pathways and
the related etiology of juvenile polyposis, He et al. (2004) generated
mice in which Bmpr1a was conditionally inactivated; the conditional
inactivation disturbed homeostasis of intestinal epithelial regeneration
with an expansion of the stem and progenitor cell populations,
eventually leading to intestinal polyposis resembling human juvenile
polyposis syndrome. He et al. (2004) showed that BMP signaling
suppresses Wnt signaling to ensure a balanced control stem cell
self-renewal. Mechanistically, PTEN, through phosphatidylinositol-3
kinase/Akt, mediates the convergence of the BMP and Wnt pathways on
control of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806). The authors concluded that BMP
signaling may control the duplication of intestinal stem cells, thereby
preventing crypt fission and the subsequent increase in crypt number.

Waite and Eng (2003) searched for a link between PTEN and BMP signaling.
They found that exposure to BMP2 (112261) increased PTEN protein levels
in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The increase in PTEN protein was
rapid and was not due to an increase in new protein synthesis,
suggesting that BMP2 stimulation inhibited PTEN protein degradation.
BMP2 treatment of MCF-7 cells decreased the association of PTEN with 2
proteins in the degradative pathway, UBE2L3 (603721) and UBE2E3
(604151). Waite and Eng (2003) suggested that BMP2 exposure may regulate
PTEN protein levels by decreasing PTEN's association with the
degradative pathway, which may explain how BMPR1A may act as a minor
susceptibility gene for PTEN-mutation-negative Cowden syndrome.

In studies of lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with
fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP; 135100) and controls, de la
Pena et al. (2005) found that FOP lymphocytes expressed 6-fold higher
levels of BMPR1A on the cell surface compared with control cells and
displayed a marked reduction in ligand-stimulated internalization and
degradation of BMPR1A. In control cells, BMP4 (112262) treatment
increased BMPR1A phosphorylation; in FOP cells, BMPR1A was
phosphorylated at a high level in the absence of the ligand and showed
no increase in response to BMP4. After treatment with the BMP antagonist
noggin (602991), BMPR1A phosphorylation decreased in control cells but
remained constant in FOP cells, indicating that BMPR1A
hyperphosphorylation is independent of ligand stimulation in FOP cells.
De la Pena et al. (2005) concluded that altered BMP receptor trafficking
may play a significant role in FOP pathogenesis.

Using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analyses, Cejalvo
et al. (2007) demonstrated that human thymus and cortical epithelial
cells produced BMP2 and BMP4 and that both thymocytes and thymic
epithelium expressed the molecular machinery to respond to these
proteins. The receptors BMPR1A and BMPR2 (600799) were mainly expressed
by cortical thymocytes, whereas BMPR1B (603248) was expressed in the
majority of thymocytes. BMP4 treatment of chimeric human-mouse fetal
thymic organ cultures seeded with CD34 (142230)-positive human thymic
progenitors resulted in reduced cell recovery and inhibition of
differentiation of CD4 (186940)/CD8 (see 186910) double-negative to
double-positive stages. Cejalvo et al. (2007) concluded that BMP2 and
BMP4 have a role in human T-cell differentiation.

MAPPING

Ide et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation
hybrid mapping to localize the BMPR1A gene to human chromosome 10q22.3.
By analysis of a monochromosome hybrid mapping panel and by FISH, Astrom
et al. (1999) mapped the BMPR1A gene to chromosome 10q23. They
identified a related intronless sequence on chromosome 6q23. Astrom et
al. (1999) stated that the mouse Bmpr1a gene maps to a region of
chromosome 14 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 10.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Juvenile polyposis (174900) is an autosomal dominant gastrointestinal
hamartomatous polyposis syndrome in which patients are at risk for
developing gastrointestinal cancers. The affected members in some
families with juvenile polyposis showed germline mutations in the MADH4
gene (SMAD4; 600993), and mutations in the PTEN gene (601728) have been
described in a few families. In an attempt to define the remaining
genetic heterogeneity, Howe et al. (2001) used a genomewide screen in 4
juvenile polyposis kindreds without germline mutations in either MADH4
or PTEN and identified linkage with markers from chromosome 10q22-q23
(maximum lod score = 4.74 at theta = 0.00). They found no recombinants
using markers developed from the vicinity of the BMPR1A gene. Genomic
sequencing of BMPR1A in each of these juvenile polyposis kindreds
disclosed germline nonsense mutations in all affected kindred members
but not in normal individuals. These findings indicated involvement of
an additional gene in the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily in
the genesis of juvenile polyposis, and documented an unanticipated
function for bone morphogenetic protein in colonic epithelial growth
control.

Friedl et al. (2002) examined 29 patients with the clinical diagnosis of
juvenile polyposis for germline mutations in the MADH4 or BMPR1A genes
and identified MADH4 mutations in 7 (24%) and BMPR1A mutations in 5
patients (17%). A remarkable prevalence of massive gastric polyposis was
observed in patients with MADH4 mutations when compared with patients
with BMPR1A mutations or without identified mutations. This, they
claimed, was the first genotype-phenotype correlation observed in
juvenile polyposis.

Zhou et al. (2001) searched for germline mutations in BMPR1A in a series
of familial and isolated European probands with juvenile polyposis
syndrome and without germline mutations of MADH4. Ten of 25 (40%)
probands were found to have germline BMPR1A mutations, 8 of which
resulted in truncated receptors and 2 of which resulted in missense
alterations: cys124 to arg (C124R; 601299.0006) and cys376 to tyr
(C376Y; 601299.0007). Almost all available component tumors from
mutation-positive cases showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the
BMPR1A region, whereas those from mutation-negative cases did not. Zhou
et al. (2001) concluded that germline BMPR1A mutations cause a
significant proportion of cases of juvenile polyposis.

Of 4 Korean patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome, Kim et al. (2003)
identified 3 mutations in the MADH4 gene and 1 in the BMPR1A gene
(601299.0008).

In 77 different familial and sporadic cases of juvenile polyposis, Howe
et al. (2004) identified germline MADH4 mutations in 14 cases (18.2%)
and BMPR1A mutations in 16 cases (20.8%). The authors noted that because
mutations were not found in more than half of the patients with juvenile
polyposis, either additional predisposing genes remain to be discovered
or alternative means of inactivation of the 2 known genes account for
these cases.

In affected members of a 3-generation Singapore Chinese family with
hereditary mixed polyposis (HMPS2; 610069), Cao et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for an 11-bp deletion in the BMPR1A gene (601299.0009).

Delnatte et al. (2006) described 4 unrelated children with juvenile
polyposis of infancy (see 612242). They showed that these children were
heterozygous for de novo germline deletion encompassing 2 contiguous
genes, PTEN (601728) and BMPR1A. They hypothesized that juvenile
polyposis of infancy is caused by the deletion of these 2 genes and that
the severity of the disease reflects cooperation between these tumor
suppressor genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yoon et al. (2005) found that, although mice deficient in either Bmpr1a
or Bmpr1b in cartilage form intact cartilaginous elements, double
mutants develop severe generalized chondrodysplasia.

Liu et al. (2005) demonstrated that mice with conditional inactivation
of the Bmpr1a gene in the facial primordia developed completely
penetrant, bilateral cleft lip/palate (119530) with arrested tooth
formation. The cleft secondary palate of Bmpr1a-mutant embryos was
associated with diminished cell proliferation in maxillary process
mesenchyme and defective anterior posterior patterning. In contrast, the
mutant mice showed elevated apoptosis in the fusing lip region of the
medial nasal process. Conditional inactivation of the Bmp4 gene resulted
in delayed fusion of the medial nasal process to form the lip, resulting
in isolated cleft lip in all mouse embryos at 12 days after conception.
However, cleft lip was only present in 22% of mouse embryos at 14.5 days
after conception, indicating spontaneous repair of cleft lip in utero
(see 600625). The findings implicated a BMP4-BMPR1A genetic pathway that
functions in lip fusion, and revealed that BMP signaling has distinct
roles in lip and palate fusion.

Schulz et al. (2013) generated mice lacking the Bmpr1a gene in all cells
descending from the Myf5 (159990)+ lineage, which are the cells that
generate constitutive brown adipose tissue. No apparent changes in
morphology, proliferation, or apoptosis were observed during early
embryonic stages, but there was reduced constitutive brown fat formation
starting at embryonic day 16.5. These mice were born runted and stayed
smaller throughout life, and the reduction of constitutive brown adipose
tissue mass remained highly significant in adult mice. This lack of
constitutive brown adipose tissue resulted in increased sympathetic
input to white adipose tissue, thereby promoting formation of
recruitable brown adipose tissue within white fat deposits. This
compensatory mechanism, aimed at restoring total brown fat-mediated
thermogenic capacity in the body, is sufficient to maintain normal
temperature homeostasis and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Schulz
et al. (2013) concluded that their data suggested an important
physiologic crosstalk between constitutive and recruitable brown fat
cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
JUVENILE POLYPOSIS SYNDROME
BMPR1A, 4-BP DEL, 44TGTT

In a kindred with juvenile polyposis (174900), Howe et al. (2001) found
that affected members had a 4-bp deletion in exon 1 (44-47delTGTT) of
the BMPR1A gene, resulting in a stop codon at nucleotides 104-106.

.0002
JUVENILE POLYPOSIS SYNDROME
BMPR1A, GLN239TER

Howe et al. (2001) found that affected members of a family with juvenile
polyposis syndrome (174900) had a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 715 of
the BMPR1A gene, changing codon 239 from glutamine to a stop codon
(Q239X).

.0003
JUVENILE POLYPOSIS SYNDROME
BMPR1A, TRP271TER

In a kindred with juvenile polyposis (174900), Howe et al. (2001) found
that affected members had a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 812,
changing a tryptophan to a stop codon (trp271 to ter; W271X).

.0004
JUVENILE POLYPOSIS SYNDROME
BMPR1A, 1-BP DEL, 961C

In a kindred with juvenile polyposis (174900), Howe et al. (2001) found
that affected members had a 1-bp deletion in exon 8 of the BMPR1A gene
(961delC), creating a stop at the next codon.

.0005
JUVENILE POLYPOSIS SYNDROME
BMPR1A, ALA338ASP

Zhou et al. (2001) identified a patient with a germline missense
mutation, ala338 to asp (A338D), in exon 8 of BMPR1A. The proband had
only colonic polyposis, which comprised hamartomatous and adenomatous
polyps and began at the age of 16 years, and lipomas. Her family
history, however, included individuals with breast cancer, renal-cell
carcinoma, brain tumor(s), or melanoma. Taken together, these features
constituted the minimum criteria (i.e., 1 major and 3 minor) for the
diagnosis of Cowden syndrome (158350) (Eng, 2000). Zhou et al. (2001)
suggested that BMPR1A mutation may define a small subset of cases of
Cowden syndrome/Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (153480) with specific
colonic phenotype.

.0006
JUVENILE POLYPOSIS SYNDROME
BMPR1A, CYS124ARG

BMPR1A, 11-BP DEL, CODON 42

In affected members of a 3-generation Singapore Chinese family with
hereditary mixed polyposis (HMPS2; 610069), which they called 'family
2,' Cao et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for an 11-bp deletion at
codon 42 in exon 2 of the BMPR1A gene, predicted to cause a frameshift
and a truncation deleting all the functional domains of BMPR1A. The
mutation was not found in any unaffected family members.

.0010
JUVENILE POLYPOSIS OF INFANCY
BMPR1A, DEL

Delnatte et al. (2006) demonstrated de novo deletion of BMPR1A and the
contiguous PTEN gene (601728) on chromosome 10q in 4 unrelated children
with juvenile polyposis of infancy (see 612242). One of the children was
a girl with extradigestive features suggesting Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba
syndrome (BRRS; 153480). She presented with macrocephaly at birth.
Severity of gastrointestinal bleeding and diarrhea led to colectomy at
age 10 months. The child died at age 3 years because of recurrent
bleeding from polyps and inanition. Because of the features of BRRS, a
search for a germline mutation of PTEN was performed. Although no
mutation was found, a large deletion of the PTEN and BMPR1A loci was
indicated by absence of paternal markers. Another of the 4 patients
presented with more than 50 juvenile polyps within the entire colon and
duodenum by age 18 months.

600832	TITLE *600832 ACIDIC LEUCINE-RICH NUCLEAR PHOSPHOPROTEIN 32 FAMILY, MEMBER A; ANP32A
;;PUTATIVE HUMAN HLA CLASS II-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; PHAP1;;
PHAP I;;
LEUCINE-RICH ACIDIC NUCLEAR PROTEIN; LANP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The putative HLA class II-associated proteins PHAP I and PHAP II were
purified and cloned on the basis of their ability to bind to the
cytoplasmic domain of the HLA DR-alpha chain (142860) (Vaesen et al.,
1994). They may be components of the transmembrane signaling pathway
that is activated after extracellular binding of ligands during the
immune response. Both proteins share extensive stretches of highly
acidic amino acids in their terminal regions, which suggested a nuclear
localization. Indeed, PHAP I is likely to be the human homolog of the
rat 'leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein' (LANP) (83.6% identity), which
is localized in the nuclei of Purkinje cells. Sequence identity
demonstrated that PHAP II is identical to the protein encoded by the
gene SET (600960).

Mutation in ataxin-1 (ATX1; 601556) causes spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1;
164400). Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse brain cDNA library
with mutant human ATX1 as bait, Matilla et al. (1997) isolated a mouse
cDNA encoding Lanp, which is 89% identical to the human protein and is
expressed in cerebellum and brainstem. Binding analysis indicated that
the strongest interaction between the proteins is with the N-terminal
147 residues on Lanp, which contain 5 leucine-rich repeats, and a
full-length ataxin-1 containing 82 glutamines. Immunohistochemical
analysis demonstrated highest levels of Lanp, like Atx1, in the nuclei
of cerebellar Purkinje cells.

MAPPING

Fink et al. (1995) mapped the PHAP1 gene to 15q22.3-q23 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization.

CYTOGENETICS

The SET gene is located on 9q34 and was found to be fused to the
putative oncogene CAN (114350) in a patient with acute undifferentiated
leukemia (von Lindern et al., 1992). The similarities between PHAP I and
SET suggested to Fink et al. (1995) that the PHAP1 gene might also form
a fusion protein with CAN. In the SET-CAN fusion gene, the breakpoint is
located 3-prime of the SET gene, but the last exon of SET is removed in
the fusion transcript. This exon encodes the last 7 amino acids
(EDEGEDD) of SET that are identical with the end of PHAP I except that
PHAP I carries an additional D (EDEGEDDD). The vast majority of cases in
which CAN is involved in acute myeloid leukemia show a specificity for
the t(6;9) translocation (Sandberg et al., 1983) that fuses the 3-prime
part of the CAN gene on 9q34 (von Lindern et al., 1990) to almost the
complete coding region of the DEK gene (125264) on 6p23 (von Lindern et
al., 1992). The translocation breakpoints always occur in intron icb-9
of CAN. The PHAP1/CAN translocation would be expected to cause acute
leukemia. Like DEK and SET, PHAP I contains an extended acidic region
that could result in a transforming capacity.

GENE FUNCTION

By micropeptide sequence analysis of a PP2A (PPP2CA; 176915) inhibitor
and database screening, Li et al. (1996) determined that the inhibitor,
termed I1PP2A, was identical to PHAP1. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that
both proteins, which contain 249 amino acids and a highly acidic
C-terminal tail, have an apparent molecular mass of 30 kD. Functional
analysis showed that recombinant PHAP1 is a potent and specific
inhibitor of PP2A and acts by binding to the C subunit of the
phosphatase.

Jiang et al. (2003) identified a pathway that regulates
mitochondria-initiated caspase activity. In this pathway, PHAP protein
promoted caspase-9 (602234) activation after apoptosome formation,
whereas PTMA (188390) negatively regulated caspase-9 activation by
inhibiting apoptosome formation. A small molecular activator of
caspase-3 (600636), PETCM, relieved PTMA inhibition and allowed
apoptosome formation at a physiologic concentration of dATP. Elimination
of PTMA expression by RNA interference sensitized cells to ultraviolet
irradiation-induced apoptosis and negated the requirement of PETCM for
caspase activation.

603481	TITLE *603481 PROTEASOME 26S SUBUNIT, NON-ATPase, 13; PSMD13
;;p40.5;;
PROTEASE 26S, SUBUNIT 11; S11
DESCRIPTION Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by a 26S ATP-dependent protease. The
protease is composed of a 20S catalytic proteasome and PA700, a 700-kD
regulatory complex (see PSMC1; 602706).

Hori et al. (1998) determined the partial protein sequences of bovine
p28 (PSMD10; 603480) and p40.5, 2 components of PA700. By searching a
sequence database, they identified cDNAs encoding the human p28 and
p40.5 homologs. The predicted human p40.5 protein contains 376 amino
acids and has a molecular mass of 43 kD. Using computerized homology
searches, Hori et al. (1998) identified Nas7, an S. cerevisiae gene
encoding a protein with 31% identity to p40.5. They disrupted the Nas7
gene and found that Nas7-deficient yeast cells were sensitive to heat
stress. Northern blot analysis revealed that p40.5 was expressed as a
1.3-kb mRNA in all human tissues tested.

By sequencing peptides obtained from purified 26S proteasome subunits,
followed by database analysis and PCR of human myeloblast cell line RNA,
Hoffman et al. (1999) cloned the PSMD13 gene, which they called subunit
11 (S11). The deduced 376-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 42.9 kD, and it shares 97% identity with mouse S11. Western blot
analysis detected S11 at about 43 kD.

By Far Western blot analysis, Hoffman et al. (1999) determined that S11
bound the 26S proteasome and the 19S regulatory complex, but not the 20S
proteasome.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PSMD13
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP STS-T99644).

606112	TITLE *606112 RIBONUCLEASE P, 14-KD SUBUNIT; RPP14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribonuclease P (RNase P) removes the 5-prime leader sequences from
precursor tRNA molecules. RNase P consists of an RNA species (H1 RNA),
the POP1 protein (602486), and at least 7 proteins called RPPs. The RPPs
have apparent molecular masses of 14 kD (RPP14), 20 kD (RPP20; 606113),
25 kD (RPP25), 29 kD (RPP29; 606114), 30 kD (RPP30; 606115), 38 kD
(RPP38; 606116), and 40 kD (RPP40; 606117). Patients with scleroderma
(181750) have serum reactive with RNase P, the Th antigen, which is also
referred to as the To antigen, and RPP30 and RPP38 (summary by Jarrous
et al., 1998, 1999).

CLONING

By biochemical purification of RNase P, micropeptide sequence analysis,
and EST database searching, Jarrous et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding RPP14. The deduced basic protein has 124 amino acids and a
predicted molecular mass of nearly 14 kD. Immunoblot analysis showed
that antibodies to RPP14 or RPP29 precipitate native RNase P.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the RPP14 gene to chromosome 3p14.3 based on an
alignment of the RPP14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF001175) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

600423	TITLE *600423 ENDOTHELIN-CONVERTING ENZYME 1; ECE1
;;ECE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 is involved in the proteolytic processing
of endothelin-1 (EDN1; 131240), -2 (EDN2; 131241), and -3 (EDN3; 131242)
to biologically active peptides.

CLONING

Schmidt et al. (1994) purified a membrane-bound protease activity from
bovine endothelial cells that specifically converts the inactive form to
EDN1. The enzyme was cleaved with trypsin and peptide sequencing
analysis confirmed it to be a zinc-chelating metalloprotease containing
the typical HEXXH (HELTH) motif. RT-PCR and cDNA screens were used to
isolate the complete cDNAs of the bovine and human enzymes.

A splice variant of the same cDNA was identified by Shimada et al.
(1995) from an umbilical vein endothelial cell library. The authors
expressed the protein in COS-1 cells and could detect it in membrane
fractions from expressing cells. Yorimitsu et al. (1995) also obtained a
human ECE cDNA by screening an ACHN human renal adenocarcinoma library.
That cDNA, referred to as AECE, encoded a predicted 770-codon open
reading frame which is was different at the amino end from the Shimada
et al. (1995) sequence but close to the Schmidt et al. (1994) sequence.
The rat ECE and human AECE amino acid sequences were over 96% alike.

GENE STRUCTURE

The ECE1 gene consists of 20 exons and spans over 120 kb (Valdenaire et
al., 1999; Funke-Kaiser et al., 2000).

Valdenaire et al. (1995) found that the precursors of the ECE1 a and b
isoform mRNAs are transcribed from 2 distinct start sites, upstream from
exon 1 and exon 3, respectively. Sequence analysis of the 2 putative
promoters revealed the presence of motifs characteristic for several
transcription factors. The authors stated that comparison of the ECE
gene structure with those of other zinc metalloproteinases, as well as a
phylogenetic study, confirmed the existence of a metalloprotease
subfamily composed of ECE1, ECE2 (610145), neutral endopeptidase
(120520), Kell blood group protein (613883), and 2 bacterial enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

Maggi et al. (2000) demonstrated that in FNC-B4 cells, which are derived
from a human fetal olfactory epithelium, both sex steroids and odorants
regulate GnRH secretion. They found biologic activity of EDN1 in this
GnRH-secreting neuronal cell. In situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry revealed gene and protein expression of EDN1 and
ECE1 in both fetal olfactory mucosa and FNC-B4 cells. Experiments with
radiolabeled EDN1 and EDN3 strongly indicated the presence of 2 classes
of binding sites, corresponding to the ETA (16,500 sites/cell) and the
ETB receptors (8,700 sites/cell). Functional studies using selective
analogs indicated that these 2 classes of receptors subserve distinct
functions in human GnRH-secreting cells. The ETA receptor subtype
mediated an increase in intracellular calcium and GnRH secretion.

MAPPING

Valdenaire et al. (1995) mapped the ECE1 gene to chromosome 1p36 by
isotopic in situ hybridization.

By Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA from human/mouse somatic
cell hybrids, Matsuoka et al. (1996) demonstrated that ECE1 maps to
chromosome 1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), they refined
the localization to 1p36.1. By FISH, Albertin et al. (1996) mapped ECE1
to 1p36 and confirmed the localization to chromosome 1 by analysis of
monochromosomal hybrids. Radiation hybrid mapping localized the gene
tentatively at the border between 1p36.3 and 1p36.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hirschsprung Disease, Cardiac Defects, and Autonomic Dysfunction

Hofstra et al. (1999) described involvement of the ECE1 gene in a
patient with skip-lesions Hirschsprung disease, cardiac defects, and
autonomic dysfunction (613870). By screening all 19 exons of the gene,
using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by sequencing,
they identified a heterozygous C-to-T transition, resulting in the
substitution of cysteine for arginine at position 742 (R742C;
600423.0001).

- Essential Hypertension

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) proposed that ECE1 is a candidate gene for
human blood pressure regulation and identified 5 polymorphisms in ECE1
among a cohort of 704 European hypertensive patients. Transient
transfection of the reporter constructs containing the -338A allele
(600423.0002) showed an increase in promoter activity compared with the
wildtype promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the
specific binding of E2F2 (600426), a transcription factor, to both ECE1b
promoter sequences, with the -338A allele being associated with an
increased affinity to E2F2 compared with -338C. In 100 untreated
hypertensive women, both the -338A and -839G (600423.0003) alleles were
significantly associated with ambulatory blood pressure values. The
authors proposed a link between the cell cycle-associated E2F family and
blood pressure regulation via a component of the endothelin system.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yanagisawa et al. (1998) and Clouthier et al. (1998) showed that mice
deficient in either endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA; 131243) or ECE1
develop defects in a subset of cephalic and cardiac neural crest
derivatives. Ednra-null mice show defects in craniofacial structures,
great vessels, and cardiac outflow tract. Ece1-null mice exhibit a
virtually identical phenotype to Ednra-deficient and
endothelin-1-deficient embryos due to the absence of biologically active
endothelin-1. Ece1-deficient mice lack enteric neurons and
epidermal/choroidal melanocytes, reproducing the phenotype of Edn3
(131242) and Ednra knockout mice. Yanagisawa et al. (1998) elaborated on
the role of the Edn1/Ednra pathway in the patterning of the aortic arch
in mice.

Eckman et al. (2003) found that Ece1 +/- mice had significantly elevated
concentrations of both beta-amyloid-40 and beta-amyloid-42 (see APP;
104760) in their brains compared with littermate controls.

Choi et al. (2006) found that doubly transgenic mice expressing an
Alzheimer disease (104300)-associated APP mutation and overexpressing
PRKCE (176975) had decreased amyloid plaques, plaque-associated neuritic
dystrophy, and reactive astrocytosis compared to mice only expressing
the APP mutation. There was no evidence for altered APP cleavage in the
doubly transgenic mice; instead, overexpression of PRKCE increased the
activity of Ece1, which degrades beta-amyloid.

Ortmann et al. (2005) found that expression of Ece1 and Ece2 was
increased in nonobese diabetic mice compared with controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, CARDIAC DEFECTS, AND AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION
ECE1, ARG742CYS

Hofstra et al. (1999) identified an arg742-to-cys mutation in the ECE1
gene in a patient with skip-lesions Hirschsprung disease, cardiac
defects, craniofacial abnormalities and other dysmorphic features, and
autonomic dysfunction (613870). The patient's parents were not available
for testing. Amino acid position 742 is in the vicinity of the active
site of ECE1 (Valdenaire et al., 1995). Hofstra et al. (1999) suggested
that the R742C mutation was responsible for, or at least contributed to,
the phenotype of the patient in view of the function of ECE1 during
murine development suggested by mouse models, the overlap in phenotypic
features of these mouse models and those of the patient, and the
functional consequences of the mutation on enzyme activity. The mutation
was thought to lead to the phenotype by resulting in reduced levels of
EDN1 and EDN3.

.0002
HYPERTENSION, ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ECE1, -338C-A

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) identified a polymorphism in the 5-prime
flanking region of the ECE1 gene, -338C-A, that was associated with
ambulatory blood pressure values (see 145500). The polymorphism is
located within a putative consensus site for E2F (see 189971) and GATA
(see 601656) proteins. The -338A allele was associated with higher
daytime and nighttime 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure in
nontreated hypertensive women. Transient transfection of the reporter
constructs containing the -338A allele showed an increase in promoter
activity compared with the wildtype promoter. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assays revealed the specific binding of E2F2 (600426), a
transcription factor, to both ECE1b promoter sequences, with the -338A
allele being associated with an increased affinity to E2F2 compared with
-338C.

.0003
HYPERTENSION, ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ECE1, -839T-G

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) identified a polymorphism in the 5-prime
flanking region of the ECE1 gene, -839T-G, that was associated with
ambulatory blood pressure values (see 145500).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GNAS is a complex imprinted locus that produces multiple transcripts
through the use of alternative promoters and alternative splicing. The
most well-characterized transcript derived from GNAS, Gs-alpha, encodes
the alpha subunit of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein
(G protein). Gs-alpha is expressed biallelically in nearly all tissues
and plays essential roles in a multitude of physiologic processes. Other
transcripts produced by GNAS are expressed exclusively from either the
paternal or the maternal GNAS allele (Bastepe and Juppner, 2005).

CLONING

- Overview of Transcripts Produced by GNAS

The GNAS locus is imprinted and encodes 4 main transcripts, Gs-alpha,
XLAS, NESP55, and the A/B transcript, as well as an antisense GNAS
transcript (GNASAS; 610540). The 4 main transcripts are produced through
the use of alternative promoters and splicing of 4 unique first exons
onto the shared exons 2 through 13. Gs-alpha is ubiquitously expressed
and encodes a protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase when activated by
an agonist-occupied G protein-coupled receptor, thereby generating the
second messenger cAMP. Gs-alpha is biallelically expressed except in a
small number of tissues, including renal proximal tubules, thyroid,
gonads, and pituitary, where it is predominantly expressed from the
maternal GNAS allele. XLAS is a large variant of Gs-alpha that is
expressed exclusively from the paternal GNAS allele, primarily in
neuroendocrine tissues and the nervous system. The XLAS and Gs-alpha
proteins are identical over their C-terminal portions, but they have
distinct N termini. NESP55 is exclusively expressed from the maternal
GNAS allele and encodes a chromogranin (see 118910)-like neuroendocrine
secretory protein that, due to a stop codon in its unique first exon,
shares no amino acid sequence with Gs-alpha. The A/B transcript, which
uses the alternative first exon A/B (also referred to as exon 1A or
1-prime), and the antisense GNAS transcript, which consists of exons
that do not overlap with any other GNAS exons, are ubiquitously
expressed noncoding transcripts that are derived exclusively from the
paternal GNAS allele. Consistent with their parent-specific expression,
the promoters of the XLAS, NESP55, A/B, and antisense transcripts are
within differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and in each case the
nonmethylated promoter drives expression. In contrast, the promoter for
Gs-alpha lacks methylation and is biallelically active in most tissues
(Bastepe and Juppner, 2005).

- Gs-Alpha Transcript

Using oligonucleotide probes for recombinants that code for alpha
subunits of G signal transduction proteins, Bray et al. (1986) screened
human brain cDNA libraries and identified 11 clones corresponding to 4
species of Gs-alpha cDNA. One of the clones was predicted to encode a
384-amino acid protein with homology to the bovine and rat Gs-alpha
proteins. The 4 clones differed in nucleotide sequence in the region
that codes for amino acid residues 71 to 88. Two forms corresponded to
proteins with molecular masses of 52 and 45 kD. The authors suggested
alternative splicing of a single precursor mRNA.

- A/B Transcript

Ishikawa et al. (1990) reported a Gs-alpha mRNA that uses a different
promoter and exon, which they termed exon 1-prime (later termed exon 1A
or A/B) that is located 2.5 kb upstream of GNAS exon 1. Exon 1-prime
does not contribute an in-frame ATG, and thus its mRNA may encode a
truncated form of Gs-alpha.

- XLAS Transcript

By restriction landmark genomic scanning, Hayward et al. (1998)
identified a differentially methylated locus containing a previously
undescribed GNAS1 exon. This exon was included within transcripts
homologous to an mRNA encoding the large G protein XL-alpha (s) in the
rat (Kehlenbach et al., 1994). Two restriction sites flanking this exon
were methylated on a maternal allele and unmethylated on a paternal
allele. RT-PCR of human fetal tissues showed that in contrast to
Gs-encoding transcripts, which were biallelic, mRNAs encoding XLAS were
derived exclusively from the paternal allele. The paternally active
alternative promoter was located 35 kb upstream of exon 1.

In rat, the paternally expressed XLAS gene is a splice variant of GNAS,
consisting of exon 1 of XL and exons 2 to 13 of GNAS. A second open
reading frame in XL exon 1, which completely overlaps the XL domain ORF,
encodes ALEX (alternative gene product encoded by the XL exon), which is
translated from the XLAS mRNA and binds the XL domain of XLAS (Klemke et
al., 2001).

- NESP55 Transcript

Hayward et al. (1998) identified a second promoter upstream of the
Gs-alpha site in addition to that for XLAS. Both upstream promoters were
associated with a large coding exon and showed opposite patterns of
allele-specific methylation and monoallelic transcription. The more
5-prime of these exons encoded the neuroendocrine secretory protein-55
(NESP55), which was expressed exclusively from the maternal allele. The
NESP55 exon is 11 kb 5-prime to the paternally expressed XLAS exon. The
transcripts from these 2 promoters both splice onto GNAS1 exon 2, yet
share no coding sequences. Despite their structural unrelatedness, the
encoded proteins, of opposite allelic origin, have both been implicated
in regulated secretion in neuroendocrine tissues. Hayward et al. (1998)
concluded that maternally (NESP55), paternally (XLAS), and biallelically
(Gs-alpha)-derived proteins are produced by different patterns of
promoter use and alternative splicing of GNAS1, a gene showing
simultaneous imprinting in both the paternal and maternal directions.

By sequencing clones obtained from human pheochromocytoma and rat
pituitary cDNA libraries, Weiss et al. (2000) identified 2 main splice
variants that included NESP55 sequences. In the 2,400-bp variant, NESP55
exons were spliced onto GNAS exons 2 to 13, and in the shorter 1800-bp
variant, NESP55 exons were spliced onto GNAS exons 2, 3, and N1. Several
cDNA clones contained inverted repeats on either the 5-prime or 3-prime
terminus, and heterogeneity in the GNAS region, such as deletion of exon
3 or insertion of a CAG trinucleotide after exon 3, was also found. The
2,400-bp variant contains an open reading frame (ORF) encoding the
NESP55 protein and an ORF encoding a truncated form of GNAS lacking exon
1. The sequence TAATG encodes the stop codon (TAA) of the NESP55 ORF as
well as the initiating methionine (ATG) of the truncated GNAS. The human
NESP55 ORF encodes a protein of about 28 kD, which has high homology
with rat Nesp55, particularly in the first 70 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis and RT-PCR detected the longer transcript in rat adrenal
medulla, pituitary, and locus ceruleus, and the shorter transcript only
in pituitary. Biochemical analysis indicated that rat Nesp55 is a
keratan sulfate proteoglycan, and like other chromogranins, Nesp55 was
proteolytically processed into smaller peptides in several rat tissues,
including a predominant GPIPIRRH peptide that is also found in human
NESP55.

- GNAS Antisense Transcript

Hayward and Bonthron (2000) described a spliced polyadenylated antisense
transcript (GNASAS; 610540) arising from the maternally methylated
region upstream of the XL-alpha-s exon, which spans the upstream NESP55
region. The antisense transcript is imprinted, and expressed only from
the paternal allele, suggesting to the authors that it may have a
specific role in suppressing in cis the activity of the paternal NESP55
allele. For further information on the GNAS antisense transcript, see
610540,

GENE STRUCTURE

Rickard and Wilson (2003) provided a schematic representation of the
GNAS locus. Exons 1 through 13 of GNAS produce the Gs-alpha transcript.
Imprinted first exons specifically used for the NESP55, XLAS, and exon
1A transcripts are located approximately 35, 14, and 2.5 kb upstream of
GNAS exon 1, respectively. These exons are spliced to GNAS exons 2
through 13. The GNAS antisense transcript originates upstream of the
XLAS exon. An alternative 3-prime exon, located within GNAS intron 3,
includes an alternative stop codon and polyadenylation site.

Bastepe and Juppner (2005) noted that the promoter regions associated
with the imprinted NESP55, XLAS, exon A/B, and antisense transcripts are
located within differentially methylated regions. In each case, the
nonmethylated promoter drives expression of the transcript. In contrast,
the Gs-alpha promoter lacks methylation and is biallelically active in
most tissues.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe in connection with a mouse/human somatic cell hybrid
panel, Sparkes et al. (1987) mapped the gene encoding the
alpha-stimulating polypeptide of G protein to chromosome 20. (See also
Blatt et al. (1988).) Ashley et al. (1987) mapped the corresponding gene
in the mouse to chromosome 2 which, by the argument of homology of
synteny, supports the assignment of the human stimulatory G protein gene
to chromosome 20.

Gejman et al. (1991) mapped the GNAS1 gene to the distal long arm of
chromosome 20 by linkage studies using a polymorphism detected by
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). A maximum lod score of
9.31 was obtained at a theta of 0.042 with the locus D20S15, previously
reported to be on the long arm of chromosome 20 (Donis-Keller et al.,
1987).

By in situ hybridization, Gopal Rao et al. (1991) assigned the GNAS1
gene to chromosome 20q12-q13.2. Using the same method, Levine et al.
(1991) mapped the GNAS1 gene to chromosome 20q13.2-q13.3.

GENE FAMILY

- G Protein Family

G proteins transduce extracellular signals received by transmembrane
receptors to effector proteins. The activity of hormone-sensitive
adenylate cyclase is regulated by at least 2 G proteins, 1 stimulatory
(Gs) and 1 inhibitory (Gi; see 139310). A third G protein, Go (139311),
is abundant in brain. Each G protein is a heterotrimer composed of an
alpha, beta, and gamma subunit. The GNAS locus encodes Gs-alpha, the
alpha subunit of the G stimulatory protein. Each of the 3 G protein
subunits is encoded by a member of 1 of 3 corresponding gene families.
Hurowitz et al. (2000) counted 16 different members of the alpha subunit
family, 5 different members of the beta subunit family, and 11 different
members of the gamma subunit family, as described in mammals. Using
BACs, they determined the gene structure and chromosome location of each
gene. The G protein family includes transducin (189970).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Rasmussen et al. (2011) presented the crystal structure of the active
state ternary complex composed of agonist-occupied monomeric
beta-2-adrenergic receptor (AR) (ADRB2; 109690) and nucleotide-free Gs
heterotrimer. The principal interactions between the beta-2-AR and Gs
involve the amino- and carboxy-terminal alpha-helices of Gs, with
conformational changes propagating to the nucleotide-binding pocket. The
largest conformational changes in the beta-2-AR include a 14-angstrom
outward movement at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 6 and
an alpha-helical extension of the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane
segment 5. The most surprising observation is a major displacement of
the alpha-helical domain of G-alpha-s relative to the Ras-like GTPase
domain.

Chung et al. (2011) applied peptide amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange
mass spectrometry to probe changes in the structure of the
heterotrimeric bovine G protein, Gs, on formation of a complex with
agonist-bound human beta-2-AR, and reported structural links between the
receptor-binding surface and the nucleotide-binding pocket of Gs that
undergo higher levels of hydrogen-deuterium exchange than would be
predicted from the crystal structure of the beta-2-AR-Gs complex.
Together with x-ray crystallographic and electron microscopic data of
the beta-2-AR-Gs complex, Chung et al. (2011) provided a rationale for a
mechanism of nucleotide exchange, whereby the receptor perturbs the
structure of the amino-terminal region of the alpha-subunit of Gs and
consequently alters the 'P-loop' that binds the beta-phosphate in GDP.

GENE FUNCTION

- Function of Gs-Alpha Protein

Mehlmann et al. (2002) demonstrated that meiotic arrest of the oocyte
can be released in mice by microinjecting the oocyte within the follicle
with an antibody that inhibits Gs. This indicates that Gs activity in
the oocyte is required to maintain meiotic arrest within the ovarian
follicle and suggests that the follicle may keep the cell cycle arrested
by activating Gs.

Harrison et al. (2003) demonstrated that signaling via the erythrocyte
ADRB2 and heterotrimeric G-alpha-s regulated the entry of the human
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Agonists that stimulate cAMP
production led to an increase in malarial infection that could be
blocked by specific receptor antagonists. Moreover, peptides designed to
inhibit G-alpha-s protein function reduced parasitemia in P. falciparum
cultures in vitro, and beta-antagonists reduced parasitemia of P.
berghei infections in an in vivo mouse model. Harrison et al. (2003)
suggested that signaling via erythrocyte ADRB2 and G-alpha-s may
regulate malarial infection across parasite species.

Adams et al. (2009) demonstrated that hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cell (HSPC) engraftment of bone marrow in fetal development is dependent
on G-alpha-S. The authors observed that HSPCs from adult mice deficient
in G-alpha-S differentiated and underwent chemotaxis, but did not home
to or engraft in the bone marrow in adult mice, and demonstrated a
marked inability to engage the marrow microvasculature. Deletion of
G-alpha-S after engraftment did not lead to lack of retention in the
marrow; rather, cytokine-induced mobilization into the blood was
impaired. In tests of the effect of G-alpha-S activation on HSPCs,
pharmacologic activators enhanced homing and engraftment in vivo. Adams
et al. (2009) concluded that G-alpha-S governs specific aspects of HSPC
localization under physiologic conditions in vivo and may be
pharmacologically targeted to improve transplantation efficiency.

- Imprinting of GNAS

Hall (1990) noted that the region of chromosome 20 occupied by the
Gs-alpha gene is homologous to an area of mouse chromosome 2 involved in
both maternal and paternal imprinting.

Campbell et al. (1994) presented evidence suggesting that GNAS1 is
biallelically expressed in a wide range of human fetal tissues. Of 75
fetuses genotyped, 13 heterozygous for a FokI polymorphism in GNAS1 were
identified whose mothers were homozygous for one or another allele.
Analysis of GNAS1 RNA from each fetus showed expression from both
parental alleles. No tissue-specific pattern of expression was
discerned. Campbell et al. (1994) concluded that if genomic imprinting
regulates the expression of the GNAS1 gene, the effect must either be
subtle and quantitative or be confined to a small subset of specialized
hormone-responsive cells within the target tissues.

Hayward et al. (2001) investigated GNAS1 imprinting in the normal adult
pituitary and found that Gs-alpha was monoallelically expressed from the
maternal allele in this tissue. They found that this monoallelic
expression of Gs-alpha was frequently relaxed in somatotroph tumors
regardless of GNAS1 mutation status. These findings implied a possible
role for loss of Gs-alpha imprinting during pituitary somatotroph
tumorigenesis and also suggested that Gs-alpha imprinting is regulated
separately from that of the other GNAS1 products, NESP55 and XL-alpha-s,
which retain maternal and paternal imprinting, respectively, in these
tumors.

To establish if the GNAS1 gene is imprinted in human endocrine tissues,
Mantovani et al. (2002) selected 14 thyroid, 10 granulosa cell, 13
pituitary (3 normal glands, 7 GH-secreting adenomas, and 3
nonfunctioning adenomas), 3 adrenal, and 11 lymphocyte samples shown to
be heterozygous for a known polymorphism in exon 5. RNA from these
tissues was analyzed by RT-PCR, and expression from both parental
alleles was evaluated by enzymatic digestion and subsequent
quantification of the resulting fragments. Most thyroid, ovarian, and
pituitary samples showed an almost exclusive or significantly
predominant expression of the maternal allele over the paternal one,
whereas in lymphocyte and adrenal samples both alleles were equally
expressed. The authors concluded that their results provided evidence
for a predominant maternal origin of GNAS1 transcripts in different
human adult endocrine tissues, particularly thyroid, ovary, and
pituitary.

Using hot-stop PCR analysis on total RNA from 6 normal human thyroid
specimens, Liu et al. (2003) showed that the majority of the Gs-alpha
mRNA (72 +/- 3%) was derived from the maternal allele. This was
considered consistent with the presence of TSH (see 188540) resistance
in patients with maternal Gs-alpha-null mutations (PHP 1a; 103580) and
the absence of TSH resistance in patients with paternal Gs-alpha
mutations (pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism). Patients with PTH (168450)
resistance in the absence of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (PHP1B;
603233) have an imprinting defect of the Gs-alpha gene resulting in both
alleles having a paternal epigenotype, which would lead to a more
moderate level of thyroid-specific Gs-alpha deficiency. The authors
found evidence of borderline TSH resistance in 10 of 22 PHP Ib patients.
The authors concluded that their study provided further evidence for
tissue-specific imprinting of Gs-alpha in humans and provided a
potential mechanism for mild to moderate TSH resistance in PHP Ia and
borderline resistance in some patients with PHP Ib.

Liu et al. (2000) showed that the human GNAS exon 1A promoter region
(2.5 kb upstream from exon 1) is imprinted in a manner similar to that
in the mouse: the region is normally methylated on the maternal allele
and unmethylated on the paternal allele. In 13 patients with
pseudohypoparathyroidism Ib, the exon 1A region was unmethylated on both
alleles, and was thus biallelically expressed. Liu et al. (2000)
proposed that the exon 1A differentially methylated region (DMR) is
important for establishing or maintaining tissue-specific GNAS
imprinting and that loss of exon 1A imprinting is the cause of PHP Ib.
(See also Bastepe et al. (2001, 2001).)

Freson et al. (2002) described a PHP Ib patient with lack of methylation
of the exon XL and 1A promoters, and biallelic methylation of the NESP55
promoter. Platelets of this patient showed a functional Gs defect,
decreased cAMP formation upon Gs-receptor stimulation, and normal
Gs-alpha sequence, but reduced Gs-alpha protein levels. The authors
hypothesized that transcriptional deregulation between the biallelically
active promoters of both exon 1A and exon 1 of Gs-alpha could explain
the decreased Gs-alpha expression in platelets and presumably in the
proximal renal tubules. Platelets demonstrated decreased NESP55 and
increased XL-alpha-s protein levels, in agreement with the methylation
status of their corresponding first exons. In a megakaryocytic cell line
MEG-01, exon 1A is methylated on both alleles, in contrast to the
normally maternally methylated exon 1A in leukocytes. Experimental
demethylation of exon 1A in MEG-01 cells led to reduced Gs-alpha
expression, in agreement with the observations in the patient. The
authors proposed that platelet studies may allow more facile evaluation
of disturbances of the GNAS1 cluster in PHP Ib patients.

Genomic imprinting, by which maternal and paternal alleles of some genes
have different levels of activity, has profound effects on growth and
development of the mammalian fetus. Plagge et al. (2004) disrupted a
paternally expressed transcript at the Gnas locus, Gnasxl, which encodes
the unusual Gs-alpha isoform XL-alpha-s. Mice with mutations in Gnasxl
had poor postnatal growth and survival and a spectrum of phenotypic
effects indicating that XL-alpha-s controls a number of key postnatal
physiologic adaptations, including suckling, blood glucose, and energy
homeostasis. Increased cAMP levels in brown adipose tissue of Gnasxl
mutants and phenotypic comparison with Gnas mutants suggested that
XL-alpha-s can antagonize Gs-alpha-dependent signaling pathways. The
opposing effects of maternally and paternally expressed products of the
Gnas locus provided tangible molecular support for the parental conflict
hypothesis of imprinting.

Two candidate imprinting control regions (ICRs) have been identified at
the compact imprinted Gnas cluster on distal mouse chromosome 2: one at
exon 1A upstream of Gnas itself and one covering the promoters of Gnasxl
and the antisense Gnas transcript, also called Nespas (Coombes et al.,
2003). Gnas itself is mainly biallelically expressed but is weakly
paternally repressed in specific tissues. Williamson et al. (2004)
showed that a paternally-derived targeted deletion of the germline
differentially methylated region at exon 1A abolished tissue-specific
imprinting of Gnas, which rescued the abnormal phenotype of mice with a
maternally-derived Gnas mutation. Imprinting of alternative transcripts,
Nesp, Gnasxl, and Nespas in the cluster was unaffected. The results
established that the differentially methylated region in exon 1A
contains an imprinting control element that specifically regulates Gnas
and comprises a characterized ICR for a gene that is only weakly
imprinted in a minority of tissues. Williamson et al. (2004) concluded
that there must be a second ICR regulating the alternative transcripts.

Williamson et al. (2006) identified a second ICR at the mouse Gnas
cluster. They showed that a paternally-derived targeted deletion of the
germline DMR associated with the antisense Nespas transcript
unexpectedly affected both the expression of all transcripts in the
cluster and methylation of 2 DMRs. The results established that the
Nespas DMR is the principal ICR at the Gnas cluster and functions
bidirectionally as a switch for modulating expression of the
antagonistically acting genes Gnasxl and Gnas. Uniquely, the Nespas DMR
acts on the downstream ICR at exon 1A to regulate tissue-specific
imprinting of the Gnas gene.

Mantovani et al. (2004) investigated the presence of a parent
specificity of Gs-alpha mutations in 10 patients affected with
McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS; 174800) and 12 isolated tumors (10
GH-secreting adenomas, 1 toxic thyroid adenoma, and 1 hyperfunctioning
adrenal adenoma). The parental origin of Gs-alpha mutations was assessed
by evaluating NESP55 and exon 1A transcripts, which are monoallelically
expressed from the maternal and paternal alleles, respectively. By this
approach, Mantovani et al. (2004) demonstrated that in isolated
GH-secreting adenomas, as well as in MAS patients with acromegaly,
Gs-alpha mutations were on the maternal allele. By contrast, the
involvement of other endocrine organs in MAS patients was not associated
with a particular parent specificity, as precocious puberty and
hyperthyroidism were present in patients with mutations on either the
maternal or the paternal allele. Moreover, isolated hyperfunctioning
thyroid and adrenal adenomas displayed the mutation on the maternal and
paternal alleles, respectively. Mantovani et al. (2004) concluded that
their data confirmed the importance of Gs-alpha imprinting in the
pituitary gland and demonstrated the high degree of tissue specificity
of this phenomenon.

To establish whether Gs-alpha is imprinted also in tissues that are site
of alteration both in PHP Ia and PPHP, Mantovani et al. (2004) selected
20 bone and 10 adipose tissue samples that were heterozygous for a known
polymorphism in exon 5. Expression from both parental alleles was
evaluated by RT-PCR and enzymatic digestion of the resulting fragments.
By this approach, the great majority of the samples analyzed showed an
equal expression of the 2 alleles. The authors concluded that their
results provided evidence for the absence of Gs-alpha imprinting in
human bone and fat and suggested that the clinical finding of
osteodystrophy and obesity in PHP Ia and PPHP patients despite the
presence of a normal Gs-alpha allele is likely due to Gs-alpha
haploinsufficiency in these tissues.

By analyzing 30 polymorphic sites across the Gnas1 gene region in
C57BL/6J x Mus spretus F1 mice, Li et al. (2004) identified 2 allelic
switch regions (ASRs) that marked boundaries of epigenetic information.
Activating signals consisting of histone acetylation and methylation of
H3 lys4 (see 602810) and silencing signals consisting of histone
methylation of H3 lys9 and DNA methylation segregated independently
across the ASRs. The authors suggested that these ASRs may allow the
transcriptional elongation to proceed through the silenced domain of
nearby imprinted promoters.

Sakamoto et al. (2004) examined the chromatin state of each parental
allele within the exon 1A-Gs-alpha promoter region by chromatin
immunoprecipitation of samples derived from mice with heterozygous
deletions within the region using antibodies to covalently modified
histones. The exon 1A DMR had allele-specific differences in histone
acetylation and methylation, with histone acetylation and H3 lysine-4
(H3K4) methylation of the paternal allele, and H3 lysine-9 (H3K9)
methylation of the maternal allele. Both parental alleles had similar
levels of histone acetylation and H3K4 methylation within the Gs-alpha
promoter and first exon, with no H3K9 methylation. In liver, where
Gs-alpha is biallelically expressed, both parental alleles had similar
levels of tri- and dimethylated H3K4 within the Gs-alpha first exon. In
contrast, in renal proximal tubules there was a greater ratio of tri- to
dimethylated H3K4 of Gs-alpha exon 1 in the more transcriptionally
active maternal as compared with the paternal allele. The authors
concluded that allele-specific differences in Gs-alpha expression
correlate in a tissue-specific manner with allele-specific differences
in the extent of H3K4 methylation, and chronic transcriptional
activation in mammals is correlated with trimethylation of H3K4.

Morison et al. (2005) reported a census of known imprinted genes in
humans and mice. They listed 83 transcriptional units, of which 29 are
imprinted in both species. They noted that there is a high level of
discordance of imprinting status between the mouse and human and that a
high proportion of imprinted genes are noncoding RNAs or genes derived
by retrotransposition.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Inactivating Mutations in the GNAS Gene

Inactivating loss-of-function mutations in the GNAS1 gene result in
pseudohypoparathyroidism Ia (PHP1A; 103580),
pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP; 612463), and progressive osseous
heteroplasia (POH; 166350) (Aldred and Trembath, 2000).

In a patient with PHP Ia and his affected mother, Patten et al. (1989,
1990) identified a heterozygous mutation in the GNAS gene (139320.0001).

Ahmed et al. (1998) performed mutation analysis in 13 unrelated
families, 8 with PHP Ia and PPHP patients, and 5 with PPHP patients
only. GNAS1 mutations were detected in 4 of the 8 families with PHP Ia:
2 novel de novo missense mutations and an identical frameshift deletion
in 2 unrelated families (139320.0011). GNAS1 mutations were not detected
in any of the families with PPHP only.

Aldred and Trembath (2000) found that a recurring 4-bp deletion in exon
7 of the GNAS1 gene (139320.0011) was common among patients with PHP1A.
The authors noted that inactivating mutations are scattered throughout
the GNAS gene with some evidence of clustering.

In 4 unrelated Italian families with PHP Ia, Mantovani et al. (2000)
identified heterozygous mutations in GNAS: 2 families had 2 previously
reported deletions in exons 5 and 7, whereas the other 2 families had 2
novel frameshift deletions (139320.0025 and 139320.0026). No mutations
were detected in the families in which PPHP was the only clinical
manifestation.

Ahrens et al. (2001) investigated 29 unrelated patients with Albright
hereditary osteodystrophy and PHP Ia or pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism
and their affected family members. All patients showed a reduced GNAS1
protein activity (mean 59% compared with healthy controls). In 21 of 29
patients (72%), 15 different mutations in GNAS1, including 11 novel
mutations, were detected. There were 8 instances in which a mother had
PPHP and her offspring had PHP Ia with AHO due to the same mutation
(see, e.g., 139320.0028). They also reported 5 unrelated patients with a
previously described 4-bp deletion in exon 7 (139320.0011), confirming
the presence of a hotspot for loss-of-function mutations in GNAS1. In 8
patients, no molecular abnormality was found in the GNAS1 gene despite a
functional defect of Gs-alpha.

Shore et al. (2002) identified heterozygous inactivating GNAS1 mutations
in 13 of 18 probands with progressive osseous heteroplasia. The
defective allele in POH was inherited exclusively from fathers, a result
consistent with a model of imprinting for GNAS1. Direct evidence that
the same mutation can cause either POH or PPHP was observed in a single
family; in this family 5 sisters had POH due to a frameshift deletion of
4 nucleotides (139320.0011) inherited from the father in whom the
mutation was nonpenetrant. Three offspring of these sisters had PPHP,
including traces of subcutaneous ossification. Shore et al. (2002)
described a second family in which the unaffected father was
heterozygous for the same GNAS1 mutation associated with POH in his 3
affected daughters. Shore et al. (2002) noted that hormone resistance,
such as that in PHP Ia, is strongly correlated with GNAS1 mutations in
the maternally derived allele, indicating that the maternal allele is
critical in some tissues for cellular functions required for signal
transduction. In contrast, severe, progressive heterotopic ossification,
such as that found in POH, correlates with paternal inheritance of the
GNAS1 mutation, suggesting that the paternal allele specifically
influences progressive osteoblastic differentiation, proliferation of
cells in soft connective tissues, or both.

Linglart et al. (2002) conducted clinical and biologic studies including
screening for mutations in the GNAS1 gene in 30 patients from 21
families with PHP: 19 with PHP associated with decreased erythrocyte Gs
activity (PHP Ia); 10 with AHO associated with decreased erythrocyte Gs
activity (isolated AHO); and 1 with PHP, hormonal resistance, and AHO
but normal erythrocyte Gs activity (PHP Ic). A heterozygous GNAS1 gene
lesion was found in 14 of 17 (82%) of the PHP Ia index cases, including
11 new mutations and a mutation hotspot involving codons 189-190 (21%).
These lesions led to a truncated protein in all but 3 cases with
missense mutations. In the patient diagnosed with PHP Ic, Gs-alpha
protein was shortened by just 4 amino acids, a finding consistent with
the conservation of Gs activity in erythrocytes and the loss of receptor
contact. No GNAS1 lesions were found in the 5 individuals with isolated
AHO who were not related to the PHP Ia patients. Intrafamilial
segregation analyses of the mutated GNAS1 allele in 9 PHP Ia patients
established that the mutation had occurred de novo on the maternal
allele in 4 and had been transmitted by a mother with a mild phenotype
in the other 5. They concluded that imprinting of GNAS1 plays a role in
the clinical phenotype of loss-of-function mutations and that a
functional maternal GNAS1 allele has a predominant role in preventing
the hormonal resistance of PHP Ia.

Aldred et al. (2002) reported 2 patients with Albright hereditary
osteodystrophy and deletions of chromosome 20q, including complete
deletion of the GNAS1 gene. One boy had a paternally inherited deletion
of chromosome 20q13.13-q13.32 and a normal biochemical evaluation
consistent with pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism. The other patient had a
maternally derived deletion of chromosome 20q13.31-q13.33 and
pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia. Neither patient showed evidence of
soft tissue ossification.

In patients with AHO, Rickard and Wilson (2003) searched the 3
overlapping upstream exons, NESP55, XL-alpha-s, and exon 1A. Analysis of
the NESP55 transcripts revealed the creation of a novel splice site in 1
patient and an unusual intronic mutation that caused retention of the
intron in another patient, neither of which could be detected by
analysis of the cDNA of GNAS1.

In a brother and sister with a PHP-Ia phenotype, who also had neonatal
diarrhea and pancreatic insufficiency, Aldred et al. (2000) identified
heterozygosity for a 12-bp in-frame insertion in the GNAS1 gene
(139320.0035). The mutation was inherited from the unaffected mother,
who was found to have germline mosaicism. Makita et al. (2007) performed
biochemical and intact cell studies of the 12-bp insertion (AVDT) and
suggested that the PHP-Ia phenotype results from the instability of the
Gs-alpha-AVDT mutant and that the accompanying neonatal diarrhea may
result from its enhanced constitutive activity in the intestine.

Adegbite et al. (2008) reviewed the charts of 111 individuals with
cutaneous and subcutaneous ossification. While most individuals with
superficial or progressive ossification had inactivating mutations in
GNAS, there were no specific genotype-phenotype correlations that
distinguished the more progressive forms such as POH from the
nonprogressive forms such as PPHP and PHP Ia/c.

- Pseudohypoparathyroidism Type Ib

In 3 brothers with a clinical diagnosis of PHP Ib (603233), Wu et al.
(2001) identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the GNAS gene
(139320.0033). The boys had decreased cAMP response to PTH infusion, but
normal erythrocyte Gs activity. When expressed in vitro, the mutant
Gs-alpha was unable to interact with PTHR1 (168468) but showed normal
coupling to other coexpressed heptahelical receptors. Wu et al. (2001)
noted that the absence of PTH resistance in the mother and maternal
grandfather who carried the same mutation was consistent with models of
paternal imprinting of the GNAS gene.

In affected members and obligate carriers of 12 unrelated families with
PHP Ib, Bastepe et al. (2003) identified a 3-kb heterozygous
microdeletion located approximately 220 kb centromeric of exon 1A, which
they called exon A/B, of the GNAS gene. Four of 16 apparently sporadic
PHP Ib patients also had the deletion. Affected individuals with the
microdeletion showed loss of exon 1A methylation, but no other
epigenetic abnormalities. In all examined cases, the deletion was
inherited from the mother, consistent with the observation of PHP Ib
developing only in offspring of female obligate carriers. The deletion
also removed 3 of 8 exons encoding syntaxin-16 (STX16; 603666.0001), but
Bastepe et al. (2003) considered the involvement of STX16 in the
molecular pathogenesis of PHP Ib unlikely. They postulated that the
microdeletion disrupts a putative cis-acting element required for
methylation at exon 1A and that this epigenetic defect underlies the
pathogenesis of PHP Ib.

In all affected individuals and obligate carriers in a large kindred
with PHP Ib, Linglart et al. (2005) identified a 4.4-kb microdeletion
overlapping with a region of the 3-kb deletion identified by Bastepe et
al. (2003). Affected individuals exhibited loss of methylation only at
GNAS exon A/B. Linglart et al. (2005) concluded that PHP Ib comprises at
least 2 distinct conditions sharing the same clinical phenotype: one
associated with the loss of exon A/B methylation alone and, in most
cases, with a heterozygous microdeletion in the STX16 region, and the
other associated with methylation abnormalities at all GNAS DMRs,
including the DMR at exon A/B.

In affected members of 2 unrelated kindreds with PHP Ib, Bastepe et al.
(2005) identified a 4.7-kb deletion (139320.0031) removing the entire
NESP55 DMR and exons 3 and 4 of the antisense transcript of the GNAS
gene (GNASAS; 610540.0001) . Maternal inheritance of the deletion caused
loss of imprinting in cis at the entire GNAS locus.

Liu et al. (2005) found that all of 20 PHP Ib probands studied had loss
of GNAS exon 1A imprinting (a paternal epigenotype on both alleles). All
5 probands with familial disease had a deletion mutation within the
closely linked STX16 gene and a GNAS imprinting defect involving only
the exon 1A region. In contrast, the STX16 mutation was absent in all
sporadic cases. The majority of these patients had abnormal imprinting
of the more upstream regions in addition to the exon 1A imprinting
defect, with 8 of 15 having a paternal epigenotype on both alleles
throughout the GNAS locus. In virtually all cases, the imprinting status
of the paternally methylated NESP55 and maternally methylated
NESPAS/XL-alpha-s promoters was concordant, suggesting that their
imprinting may be coregulated, whereas the imprinting of the
NESPAS/XL-alpha-s promoter region and XL-alpha-s first exon was not
always concordant, even though they are closely linked and lie within
the same DMR. The authors concluded that familial and sporadic forms of
PHP Ib have distinct GNAS imprinting patterns that occur through
different defects in the imprinting mechanism.

- Activating Mutations in the GNAS Gene

Activating gain-of-function mutations in the GNAS1 gene result in the
McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS; 174800), polyostotic fibrous dysplasia
(POFD; see 174800), and various endocrine tumors. These activating
mutations are present in the mosaic state, resulting from a postzygotic
somatic mutation appearing early in the course of development which
yields a monoclonal population of mutated cells within variously
affected tissues. The nonmosaic state for activating mutations is
presumably lethal to the embryo (Aldred and Trembath, 2000; Lumbroso et
al., 2004).

Weinstein et al. (1991) analyzed DNA from tissues of 4 patients with the
McCune-Albright syndrome for the presence of activating mutations in the
GNAS1 gene and identified 1 of 2 activating mutations, R201C
(139320.0008) and R201H (139320.0009) in tissues from all 4 patients.

Among 113 patients with McCune-Albright syndrome, including 98 girls and
15 boys, Lumbroso et al. (2004) found that 43% had a GNAS1 mutation
involving arg201, with a net preponderance of the R201H (n = 34)
compared to R201C (n = 15). No difference in severity or manifestations
of the disease was noted between the two mutations. In patients who had
several tissue samples analyzed, the same mutation was always found,
supporting the hypothesis of an early postzygotic somatic mutation.

Bianco et al. (2000) analyzed a series of 8 consecutive cases of
polyostotic fibrous dysplasia without other features of McCune-Albright
syndrome and identified arg201 mutations (see, e.g., 139320.0013) in the
GNAS1 gene in all of them.

In a review, Aldred and Trembath (2000) noted that mutations leading to
constitutive activation of the GNAS1 gene occur in 2 specific codons,
201 and 227.

Fragoso et al. (2003) identified somatic heterozygous mutations in the
GNAS1 gene (139320.0009; 139320.0013) in adrenal tissue from 3 unrelated
patients with ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH;
219080). The mutations resulted in constitutive activation of the G
protein. The mutations were not present in peripheral blood, and none of
the patients had signs of McCune-Albright syndrome. Fragoso et al.
(2003) discussed whether the patients could be considered part of the
spectrum of McCune-Albright syndrome or whether they represent isolated
cases of AIMAH associated with somatic mutations.

- Somatic Mutations in Pituitary Adenomas

Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH; 139190) uses cAMP as a second
messenger to stimulate growth hormone (GH; 139250) secretion and
proliferation of normal pituitary somatotrophs (Billestrup et al.,
1986). Vallar et al. (1987) identified constitutive activation of Gs in
tissue from a subset of GH-secreting pituitary tumors (102200).

In a series of 32 corticotroph adenomas of the pituitary (219090),
Williamson et al. (1995) found 2 with somatic mutations in the GNAS1
gene at codon 227 (139320.0010; 139320.0012).

Hayward et al. (2001) noted that approximately 40% of growth
hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas contain somatic mutations in the
GNAS1 gene. These mutations, which occur at arg201 or glu227 (see, e.g.,
139320.0008 and 139320.0010, respectively), constitutively activate the
alpha subunit of GNAS1. Although transcripts encoding Gs-alpha are
biallelically derived in most human tissues, Hayward et al. (2001)
showed that the mutation had occurred on the maternal allele in 21 of 22
GNAS1-positive somatotroph adenomas. They also showed that Gs-alpha is
monoallelically expressed from the maternal allele in normal adult
pituitary tissue. This monoallelic expression of Gs-alpha was frequently
relaxed in somatotroph tumors regardless of GNAS1 mutation status. These
findings implied a possible role for loss of Gs-alpha imprinting during
pituitary somatotroph tumorigenesis.

- Other Disease Associations

Jia et al. (1999) identified a common silent polymorphism in the GNAS1
gene involving a change of codon 131 from ATT (ile) to ATC (ile). The
authors found a significant difference in the frequency of the alleles
between 268 white patients with essential hypertension (145500) (51% +)
and a matched group of 231 control subjects (58% +) (P = 0.02).

Genevieve et al. (2005) reported 2 unrelated girls who presented with
severe pre- and postnatal growth retardation and had de novo
interstitial deletions of chromosome 20q13.2-q13.3. Molecular studies
showed that the deletions were of paternal origin in both girls and were
approximately 4.5 Mb in size, encompassing the GNAS imprinted locus,
including paternally imprinted Gnasxl, and the TFAP2C gene (601602).
Both patients had intractable feeding difficulties, microcephaly, facial
dysmorphism with high forehead, broad nasal bridge, small chin and
malformed ears, mild psychomotor retardation, and hypotonia. Genevieve
et al. (2005) noted that a mouse model with disruption of the Gnasxl
gene had poor postnatal growth and survival (Plagge et al., 2004), and
that a patient reported by Aldred et al. (2002) with a paternal deletion
of the GNAS complex also showed pre- and postnatal growth retardation
and feeding difficulties. Moreover, disruption of the Tfap2c gene in
mice had been shown to affect embryonic development (Werling and
Schorle, 2002).

Using metaanalysis combining data from case control and family studies
in Gambia, Kenya, and Malawi and a case control study from Ghana, Auburn
et al. (2008) detected associations between intronic or conservative
SNPs of GNAS and severe malaria. SNPs with significant associations
clustered in the 5-prime end of GNAS. Auburn et al. (2008) proposed that
the impact of GNAS on malaria parasite invasion efficacy may alter
susceptibility to disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yu et al. (1998) generated mice with a mutation in exon 2 of the Gnas
gene, resulting in a null allele. Homozygous Gs deficiency was
embryonically lethal. Heterozygotes with maternal (m-/+) and paternal
(+/p-) inheritance of the Gnas null allele had distinct phenotypes,
suggesting that Gnas is an imprinted gene. Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
resistance is present in m-/+ but not +/p- mice. Expression of the alpha
subunit in the renal cortex (the site of PTH action) was markedly
reduced in m-/+ but not in +/p- mice, demonstrating that the Gnas
paternal allele is imprinted in this tissue. Gnas was also imprinted in
brown and white adipose tissue. The maximal physiologic response to
vasopressin (urinary concentrating ability) was normal in both m-/+ and
+/p- mice and Gnas was not imprinted in the renal inner medulla, the
site of vasopressin action. Tissue-specific imprinting of Gnas was
likely the mechanism for variable and tissue-specific hormone resistance
in the knockout mice and a similar mechanism might explain the variable
phenotype in AHO.

Exon 2 m-/+ mice are obese and hypometabolic, whereas exon 2 +/p- mice
are lean and hypermetabolic. To study the effect of Gs-alpha deficiency
without disrupting other Gnas gene products, Chen et al. (2005)
disrupted exon 1 of the Gnas gene in mice. They found that exon 1 +/p-
mice lacked the exon 2 +/p- phenotype and developed obesity and insulin
resistance. Exon 2 and exon 1 m-/+ mice both had subcutaneous edema at
birth, presumably due to loss of maternal Gs-alpha expression; however,
they differed in other respects, raising the possibility for the
presence of other maternal-specific gene products. Exon 1 m-/+ mice had
more severe obesity and insulin resistance and a lower metabolic rate
relative to exon 1 +/p- mice. Chen et al. (2005) concluded that the
lean, hypermetabolic, and insulin-sensitive exon 2 +/p- phenotype
appeared to result from XL-alpha-s deficiency, whereas loss of
paternal-specific Gs-alpha expression in exon 1 +/p- mice led to an
opposite metabolic phenotype. Thus, alternative GNAS gene products have
opposing effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. The differences
between exon 1 m-/+ and +/p- mice presumably resulted from differential
effects on Gs-alpha expression in tissues where Gs-alpha is normally
imprinted.

A suspicion of the existence of one or more imprinted genes on distal
mouse chromosome 2 had been raised by Cattanach and Kirk (1985) and
Peters et al. (1994): paternal uniparental disomy (UPD)/maternal
deletion and maternal UPD/paternal deletion of a region between
breakpoints T2Wa and T28H on distal mouse chromosome 2 resulted in
distinct phenotypes and early lethality. Neuronatin (NNAT; 603106) is an
imprinted gene on distal mouse chromosome 2 that maps outside the
T2Wa-T28H imprinted region (Kikyo et al., 1997). Given the large
distance and the presence of multiple nonimprinted genes between Gnas
and Nnat, it is likely that they lie within distinct imprinting domains.
The tissue-specific imprinting of Gnas observed by Yu et al. (1998) had
been demonstrated for other imprinted genes; e.g., DeChiara et al.
(1991) had demonstrated tissue-specific parental imprinting in the case
of the insulin-like growth factor II gene (147280) by study of targeted
disruption of the gene in mice.

Bastepe et al. (2004) studied chimeric mice containing wildtype
chondrocytes and chondrocytes with either homozygous or heterozygous
disruption of Gnas exon 2. Haploinsufficiency of Gnas signaling resulted
in chondrocytes that differentiated prematurely. The phenotype was
similar to that observed in Pthr1 (168468)-deficient mice. Bastepe et
al. (2004) determined that expression of Gnas in chondrocytes occurs
from both parental alleles. They concluded that GNAS is the primary
mediator of PTHR1 in chondrocytes and that haploinsufficiency of GNAS
signaling contributes to the skeletal phenotypes of AHO.

GNAS, MET1VAL

In a mother and son with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (103580),
Patten et al. (1989, 1990) identified a heterozygous A-to-G transition
in exon 1 of the GNAS1 gene, resulting in a met1-to-val (M1V)
substitution at the initiator codon. Initiation at the next AUG was
in-frame and predicted to result in deletion of 59 N-terminal amino
acids. Laboratory studies showed that the GNAS protein was reactive with
a C-terminal Gs-alpha antiserum, but not with 2 Gs-alpha peptide
antisera to amino acid residues 28-42 or 47-61. This was the first
molecular delineation of a mutation in a human G protein and a
conclusive demonstration that mutation at the GNAS1 locus results in
AHO.

In 4 sisters with PHP Ia (103580), Weinstein et al. (1990) identified a

resulting in a splice site mutation. The authors used PCR to amplify
genomic fragments with an attached high-melting G+C-rich region ('GC
clamp') and DGGE to analyze the fragments. All 4 daughters had decreased
Gs-alpha mRNA and functional Gs-alpha deficiency. The mother, who had
PPHP (612463), also carried the heterozygous mutation. She had minor
stigmata of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy, such as unilateral
brachyphalangy I, x-ray evidence of subcutaneous calcifications, and
short stature relative to other members of her family, but no hormonal
abnormalities. The kindred had previously been reported by Kinard et al.

In various tissues from 4 patients with McCune-Albright syndrome
(174800), Weinstein et al. (1991) found 1 of 2 activating mutations
within codon 201 in exon 8 of the GNAS gene. Two patients carried an
arg201-to-cys substitution (R201C); the other 2 carried an R201H
substitution (139320.0009). Tissues analyzed included affected endocrine
organs, such as gonads, adrenal glands, thyroid, and pituitary, as well
as tissues not classically involved in the McCune-Albright syndrome. In
each patient the proportion of cells affected varied from tissue to
tissue. In 2 endocrine organs, the highest proportion of mutant alleles
was found in regions of abnormal cell proliferation. Weinstein et al.
(1991) concluded that somatic mutation of the GNAS gene early in
embryogenesis resulted in the mosaic population of normal and
mutant-bearing tissues that underlie the clinical manifestations of
McCune-Albright syndrome.

Candeliere et al. (1995) found the R201C mutation in a 14-year-old boy
who had previously been reported as a case of panostotic fibrous
dysplasia (see 174800).

Landis et al. (1989) identified somatic gain-of-function mutations in
the GNAS1 gene in 4 of 8 growth hormone (GH; 139250)-secreting pituitary
tumors (102200) surgically removed from patients with acromegaly. Two
tumors contained a C-to-T transition resulting in an R201C substitution.
The other 2 tumors had an R201H substitution (139320.0009) and a Q227R
substitution (139320.0010), respectively. All the mutations resulted in
constitutive activation of Gs by inhibiting its GTPase activity and
behaved like dominantly acting oncogenes.

Yang et al. (1996) identified somatic mutations at GNAS codon 201 in 9
of 21 pituitary adenomas derived from Korean patients with acromegaly.
Eight tumors had the R201C mutation and 1 had an R201S substitution
(139320.0013). Clinically, patients with the GNAS mutations were older
and responded better to octreotide-induced growth hormone suppression
than those without mutations.

Collins et al. (2003) identified an R201C mutation in thyroid carcinoma
derived from a patient with McCune-Albright syndrome.

Fragoso et al. (1998) identified a somatic R201C mutation in 4 (66.6%)
of 14 human sex cord stromal tumors, including ovarian and testicular
Leydig cell tumors. In contrast, no GIP2 (139360) mutations were found
in any of the sex cord stromal tumors studied.

Kalfa et al. (2006) detected the R201C mutation in 8 of 30 cases of
juvenile ovarian granulosa cell tumor, the most common sex cord stromal
tumor. Laser microdissection confirmed that the mutation was exclusively
localized in the tumoral granulosa cells and was absent in the ovarian
stroma. Patients with a hyperactivated G-alpha-s exhibited a
significantly more advanced tumor (p less than 0.05) because 7 of them
(77.7%) were staged as Ic or had had a recurrence.

In 2 patients with McCune-Albright syndrome (174800), Weinstein et al.

GNAS gene in endocrine organs affected in this disorder, such as gonads,
adrenal glands, thyroid, and pituitary, as well as tissues not
classically involved. In 2 endocrine organs, ovary and adrenal, the
highest proportion of mutant alleles was found in regions of abnormal
cell proliferation. Weinstein et al. (1991) concluded that somatic
mutation of the GNAS gene early in embryogenesis resulted in the mosaic
population of normal and mutant-bearing tissues that underlie the
clinical manifestations of McCune-Albright syndrome. It remained an open
question whether GNAS1 mutations were causally related to the
nonendocrine abnormalities in 3 of the patients: chronic liver disease
in 1, thymic hyperplasia in 2, gastrointestinal adenomatous polyps in 1,
cardiopulmonary disease in 1, and sudden death in 2.

Schwindinger et al. (1992) found a G-to-A transition resulting in the
R201H substitution in a patient with McCune-Albright syndrome who had
severe bony involvement, characteristic skin lesions, and a history of
hyperthyroidism. The mutation was found in a higher proportion of skin
cells from affected areas than from unaffected areas. The findings
confirmed the Happle (1986) hypothesis that this disorder is due to
mosaicism for a postzygotic GNAS1 mutation. The authors noted that
arg201 is also the site of ADP-ribosylation by the cholera toxin.

Collins et al. (2003) identified the R201H mutation in thyroid carcinoma
from a patient with McCune-Albright syndrome.

In 2 growth hormone (GH; 139250)-secreting pituitary tumors (102200)
surgically removed from patients with acromegaly, Landis et al. (1989)
identified a somatic mutation in the GNAS1 gene, resulting in an R201H
substitution. The mutation resulted in constitutive activation of Gs by
inhibiting its GTPase activity and behaved like a dominantly acting

Fragoso et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous R201H mutation in
adrenal tissue from 2 unrelated patients with ACTH-independent
macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (219080).

In 1 of 30 cases of juvenile ovarian granulosa cell tumor, the most
common sex cord stromal tumor, Kalfa et al. (2006) detected the R201H

GNAS, 4-BP DEL, 565CTGA

In a patient with PHP1A (103580), Weinstein et al. (1992) identified a
heterozygous 4-bp deletion (565delCTGA) in exon 7 of the GNAS1 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon. Analysis of
lymphocyte RNA by reverse transcription-PCR and direct sequencing showed
that the GNAS1 allele bearing the mutation was not expressed as mRNA.
Consistent with this, Northern blot analysis revealed an approximately
50% deficiency in steady state levels of GNAS1 mRNA.

Ahmed et al. (1998) identified this deletion mutation in 2 unrelated
families with PHP Ia.

Shore et al. (2002) provided direct evidence that the 4-bp deletion can
cause either progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH; 166350) or Albright
hereditary osteodystrophy without hormone resistance (PPHP; 612463) in
the same family. Five sisters with POH had inherited this mutation from
the father in whom the mutation was nonpenetrant. Three offspring of
these sisters had AHO, including traces of subcutaneous ossification.
Shore et al. (2002) suggested that POH requires paternal inheritance of
a GNAS1 mutation, whereas hormone resistance is more likely to occur
when the genetic defect is maternally inherited.

Ahmed et al. (2002) cautioned against a premature conclusion that POH
may require paternal inheritance. In a family reported by Ahmed et al.
(1998), the 4-bp deletion was found in a brother and sister and in their
mother but not in their father. Aside from brachymetacarpia and short
stature, the mother did not have features of AHO. The daughter had
typical features of AHO and hormone resistant PHP1A; in contrast, her
brother presented in the first year of life with ossification of
subcutaneous tissue that was followed by progressive, generalized
heterotopic ossification of skeletal muscle, without any clear evidence
of hormone resistance. These cases exemplified the wide phenotypic
heterogeneity in persons with mutations in GNAS1, even within 1 family.

Bastepe and Juppner (2002) suggested that, like some patients who have
either PHP type Ia or PHP type Ib, the son described by Ahmed et al.
(1998) may have developed resistance to parathyroid hormone later in
life or not at all. Given that the patient's sister and mother had PHP
type Ia and PPHP, respectively, POH resulting from maternally inherited
GNAS1 mutations may actually represent an incomplete form of PHP type
Ia. Bastepe and Juppner (2002) suggested that the underlying mechanism
for this form of POH may be distinct from that described by Shore et al.
(2002), which appears to result only from paternally inherited GNAS1
mutations.

Adegbite et al. (2008) identified heterozygosity for the 565delCTGA
mutation in the GNAS gene in 13 POH cases (10 familial cases among 3
different families, and 3 individual spontaneous cases). The mutation
resulted in variable severity and pleiotropy, both in family members and
in unrelated sporadic cases.

GNAS, GLN227HIS

In a series of 32 corticotroph adenomas of the pituitary (219090),
Williamson et al. (1995) found 2 with somatic mutations in the GNAS1
gene at codon 227. One had a Q227R (139320.0010) substitution, and the
other had a mutation resulting in a gln227-to-his (Q227H) substitution.
The latter patient was a 35-year-old male who presented with severe
Cushing syndrome complicated by psychosis.

In a series of growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumors (102200)
derived from 21 Korean acromegalic patients, Yang et al. (1996) found
that 1 tumor had a somatic C-to-A transversion in the GNAS1 gene,
resulting in an arg201-to-ser (R201S) substitution.

Candeliere et al. (1997) reported a patient with polyostotic fibrous
dysplasia (see 174800) in whom the R201S mutation was identified in the
somatic mosaic state.

Fragoso et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous somatic R201S mutation
in adrenal tissue from a patient with ACTH-independent macronodular
adrenal hyperplasia (219080).

GNAS, SER250ARG

In a patient with PHP Ia (103580), Warner et al. (1997) identified a
ser250-to-arg (S250R) mutation in the GNAS1 gene. Both GNAS1 activity
and expression were decreased by approximately 50% in erythrocyte
membranes from the affected patient. In vitro functional expression
studies suggested that substitution or deletion of residue 250 may alter
guanine nucleotide binding, which could lead to thermolability and
impaired function.

GNAS, 38-BP DEL, EX1/IVS1 BOUNDARY

In affected members of a large kindred in which 2 mothers had
pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP; 612463) and their 6 offspring had
PHP Ia (103580), Fischer et al. (1998) identified a 38-bp deletion at
the exon 1/intron 1 boundary of the GNAS gene. The deletion was
predicted to eliminate the splice donor site of exon 1. Some of the
patients had increased basal serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH; see 188540) and/or excessive TSH responses to
thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; 613879). The pseudo-PHP patients had
decreased Gs activity, but normal urinary cAMP responses to PTH, normal
TSH levels and responses to TRH, and normal serum levels of calcium and
PTH.

PSEUDOPSEUDOHYPOPARATHYROIDISM
GNAS, ARG258TRP

In a 24-year-old man with PPHP (612463), Warner et al. (1998) identified
a de novo arg258-to-trp (R258W) mutation in the GNAS1 gene. Arg258 is a
nonconserved residue adjacent to a highly conserved glutamic acid
residue, glu259, that is important for contact between switch 2 and 3 in
the activated state. Warner et al. (1998) presented evidence that
substitution of arg258 led to defective GDP binding, resulting in
increased thermolability and decreased activation. Developmental delay,
brachycephaly, and decreased muscle tone were noted by age 10 months.
Throughout childhood he was small for his age and stocky in appearance.
By 6 years, he developed learning disabilities as well as impulsive and
aggressive behavior. Brachydactyly involved the distal phalanx of the
thumb and the fourth metacarpals bilaterally. He also had intracranial
calcifications in the globus pallidus. There was no evidence of
resistance to parathyroid hormone or thyrotropin.

.0017
PSEUDOPSEUDOHYPOPARATHYROIDISM
GNAS, ARG258ALA

Warner et al. (1998) identified a heterozygous arg258-to-ala (R258A)
substitution in the GNAS gene as a cause of PPHP (612463). The
substitution led to increased GDP release and impaired receptor-mediated
activation. Based on the crystal structure of GNAS1, arg258 interacts
with residue gln170 within the helical domain. Loss of this interaction
was predicted to open the cleft between the GTPase and helical domain,
resulting in more rapid GDP release, as observed in the arg258 variants.
Warner et al. (1998) suggested that interactions between arg258 and the
helical domain are important for receptor-mediated activation. This same
codon was affected in another patient with AHO (R258W; 139320.0016).

Warner and Weinstein (1999) showed that a gln170-to-ala substitution
(Q170A; 139320.0018) also leads to increased GDP release but does not
affect receptor-mediated activation. Therefore, interactions between
arg258 and gln170 are important for maintaining guanine nucleotide
binding but are not important for activation by receptor. Warner and
Weinstein (1999) also showed that the R258A mutation, but not Q170A, was
associated with a markedly elevated intrinsic GTPase rate, resulting in
more rapid inactivation. Arg258, through mutual interactions with glu50,
may constrain arg201, a residue critical for catalyzing GTP hydrolysis.
Disruption of the interaction between arg258 and glu50 may relieve this
constraint and allow arg201 to interact more efficiently with the
gamma-phosphate of GTP in the transition state. This is an example of a
mutation in a heterotrimeric G protein that increases the intrinsic
GTPase activity and provides another mechanism by which receptor
signaling can be impaired by G protein mutations.

PSEUDOHYPOPARATHYROIDISM, TYPE IA, WITH TESTOTOXICOSIS
GNAS, ALA366SER

Iiri et al. (1994) studied 2 unrelated boys who had a paradoxical
combination of PHP Ia (103580) and testotoxicosis (176410). Both boys
were found to have an ala366-to-ser (A366S) mutation in the GNAS1 gene.
PHP Ia is marked by resistance to hormones acting through cyclic AMP
(parathyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone) as well as a 50%
decrease in erythrocyte Gs activity in this heterozygous disorder. In
contrast, testotoxicosis is a form of precocious puberty in which the
Leydig cells secrete testosterone in the absence of luteinizing hormone,
often due to constitutive activation of the luteinizing hormone receptor
and (indirectly) of Gs. Iiri et al. (1994) demonstrated that this A366S
mutation constitutively activated adenylyl cyclase in vitro, causing
hormone-independent cAMP accumulation when expressed in cultured cells,
and accounting for the testotoxicosis phenotype. Although the mutant
form was quite stable at testis temperature, it was rapidly degraded at
37 degrees centigrade, explaining the PHP Ia phenotype caused by loss of
Gs activity. In vitro experiments indicated that accelerated release of
GDP caused both the constitutive activity and the thermolability of the
A366S mutant form.

.0020
PSEUDOHYPOPARATHYROIDISM, TYPE IA
GNAS, ARG231HIS

In patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (103580), Farfel et
al. (1996) identified an arg231-to-his (R231H) mutation in the GNAS1
gene which impaired the ability of the mutant protein to mediate
hormonal stimulation of cAMP accumulation in transiently transfected
cells.

Iiri et al. (1997) reported biochemical analyses showing that an
activation defect caused by the R231H mutation was paradoxically
intensified by hormonal and other stimuli. By substituting histidine for
a conserved arginine residue, the mutation removed an internal salt
bridge (to a conserved glutamate) that normally acts as an
intramolecular hasp to maintain tight binding of the gamma-phosphate of
GTP. The activation defect became prominent only under conditions that
destabilized binding of guanine nucleotide (receptor stimulation) or
impaired the ability of alpha-s to bind the gamma-phosphate of GTP
(e.g., cholera toxin). Although GDP release is usually the rate-limiting
step in nucleotide exchange, the biochemical phenotype of this mutant
GNAS indicated that efficient G protein activation by receptors and
other stimuli depends on the ability of the protein to clasp tightly the
GTP molecule that enters the binding site. The 3 affected patients in
the family carrying the R231H mutation of the GNAS1 gene showed classic
clinical features of PHP Ia, including Albright hereditary
osteodystrophy, but Gs activities in their erythrocytes were nearly
normal (ranging between 60% and 90% of normal). Erythrocyte membranes of
most PHP I patients contain only 50% of the normal complement of Gs
activity and these patients are classified as PHP Ia, indicating that
the affected patients carry inactivating mutations in the GNAS1 gene. In
contrast, the PHP Ib phenotype is found in a smaller number of PHP I
patients whose erythrocytes contain normal (or nearly normal) Gs
activity. The R231H patients showed that results of the erythrocyte Gs
assay can lead to an incorrect inference with respect to the genetic
basis of the disease. PHP I patients with apparently normal or nearly
normal erythrocyte Gs activities merit careful investigation, especially
when they display the classic clinical phenotype, including Albright
hereditary osteodystrophy. Although such patients may inherit mutations
in genes other than GNAS1, their GNAS1 gene may encode mutant proteins
with instructive qualitative defects, including impairment of
conformational change, subcellular localization, or interaction with
other proteins, including receptors, effectors, and regulators of G
protein signaling proteins.

Ishikawa et al. (2001) found the R231H mutation in exon 9 of the GNAS1
gene in a Japanese patient with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia.

MCCUNE-ALBRIGHT SYNDROME, SOMATIC, MOSAIC
GNAS, ARG201GLY

Riminucci et al. (1999) studied a patient who had been diagnosed with
McCune-Albright syndrome (174800) at the age of 8 years. In an affected
parietal bone sample, the authors identified a heterozygous C-to-G
transversion in the GNAS1 gene, resulting in an arg201-to-gly (R201G)
amino acid substitution. The boy presented with precocious puberty,
facial deformities, and typical cafe-au-lait spots with a 'coast of
Maine' profile. Extensive involvement of the cranial vault was apparent
on x-ray. At the age of 13, acromegalic bone changes and growth hormone
oversecretion were detected. With the exception of a single case of
polyostotic fibrous dysplasia in which an R201S mutation was found
(139320.0013), R201C (139320.0008) and R201H (139320.0009) had been the
mutations consistently found in McCune-Albright syndrome patients and in
non-MAS cases of fibrous dysplasia of bone. Thus, of the predicted
missense mutations of codon 201, only R201P and R201L remained
undetected (although R201L had been observed by Gorelov et al. (1995) in
isolated, non-MAS endocrine tumors).

GNAS, 4.7-KB DEL

In 2 unrelated kindreds with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib (603233),

that removed the differentially methylated region (DMR) of the GNAS gene
encompassing the NESP55 region and exons 3 and 4 of the GNAS antisense
transcript (GNASAS; 610540.0001). When inherited from a female, the
deletion abolished all maternal GNAS imprints and derepressed maternally
silenced transcripts, suggesting that the deleted region contains a
cis-acting element that controls imprinting of the maternal GNAS allele.

RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
GNAS, 36-BP DUP, ALA138ASP, PRO161ARG

This variant, formerly titled PROLONGED BLEEDING TIME, BRACHYDACTYLY,
AND MENTAL RETARDATION, has been reclassified because delineation of the
phenotype and the contribution of the variant to the phenotype are
unclear.

In 3 patients from 2 families with markedly prolonged bleeding time
accompanied by neurologic problems, brachydactyly, and a variable degree
of mental retardation, Freson et al. (2001) identified a paternally
inherited functional polymorphism in XL exon 1, consisting of a 36-bp
duplication and 2 nucleotide substitutions, resulting in changes of
codon 138 from alanine to aspartic acid (A138D) and of codon 161 from
proline to arginine (P161R), that was associated with Gs hyperfunction
in platelets, leading to an increased trauma-related bleeding tendency.

Freson et al. (2003) described 8 additional patients who inherited the
same XLAS polymorphism paternally and who showed Gs hyperfunction in
their platelets and fibroblasts. The clinical features were variable: 3
patients resembled those reported by Freson et al. (2001) and had
psychomotor retardation, disturbed behavior, facial dysmorphism, feeding
or gastrointestinal motility problems, and abnormal bleeding following
trauma, whereas 5 patients had growth deficiency and no clinical
bleeding abnormalities. All carriers also had an elongated ALEX protein
as a consequence of the paternally inherited insertion. The paternally
inherited double XLAS/ALEX functional polymorphism was also associated
with elevated platelet membrane Gs-alpha protein levels. The in vitro
interaction between the 2 elongated XLAS and ALEX proteins was markedly
reduced. Freson et al. (2003) suggested that in contrast to the strong
interaction between the 2 wildtype proteins, the defective association
may result in unimpeded receptor-stimulated activation of XLAS.

GNAS, 3-BP DEL, CAT, EXON 13

In 3 brothers with a clinical diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism type
Ib (603233) and their clinically unaffected mother and maternal
grandfather, Wu et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp
deletion (CAT) in exon 13 of the GNAS gene, resulting in the deletion of
ile382. Biochemical studies showed normal erythrocyte Gs activity, but
decreased cAMP response to PTH infusion. When expressed in vitro, mutant
Gs-alpha was unable to interact with PTHR1 (168468) but showed normal
coupling to other coexpressed heptahelical receptors. The mutation was
not found in the unaffected father and sister or in 30 unrelated
controls. Wu et al. (2001) noted that the absence of PTH resistance in
the mother and maternal grandfather who carried the same mutation was
consistent with models of paternal imprinting of the GNAS gene.

GNAS, 1-BP INS, A, EXON 3

In a 10-year-old girl with brachymetacarpia, mental retardation,
normocalcemic pseudohypoparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism (103580),
Thiele et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous insertion of an adenosine
in exon 3 of the GNAS gene, altering codon 85 and leading to a
frameshift and a stop at codon 87 in exon 4. Molecular studies of cDNA
from blood RNA demonstrated normal, biallelic expression of Gs-alpha-S
transcripts, whereas expression of Gs-alpha-L transcripts from the
maternal allele was reduced. Both the reduced activity and the mutation
were also found in the mother and the affected younger brother. Thiele
et al. (2007) noted that this was the first reported pathogenic mutation
in exon 3 of the GNAS gene. The mutation is associated with
pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia due to selective deficiency of
Gs-alpha-L and a partial reduction of Gs-alpha activity.

.0035
PSEUDOHYPOPARATHYROIDISM, TYPE IA
GNAS, 12-BP INS, NT1107

In a brother and sister with a PHP Ia phenotype (103580), who also had
neonatal diarrhea and pancreatic insufficiency, Aldred et al. (2000)
identified heterozygosity for a 12-bp insertion in exon 13 of the GNAS1
gene, resulting in an in-frame ala-val-asp-thr (AVDT) repeat at codon
366 within the beta-6/alpha-5 loop. The mutation was not found in 2
unaffected sibs and was also not detected in the lymphocyte DNA of
either of the clinically unaffected parents. Haplotype analysis
confirmed germline mosaicism and indicated that the mutation was
maternal in origin.

By biochemical and intact cell analysis of the mutant Gs-alpha
containing the AVDT repeat within its GDP/GTP binding site, Makita et
al. (2007) demonstrated that the mutant protein was unstable but
constitutively active as a result of rapid GDP release and reduced GTP
hydrolysis, suggesting that instability and paradoxical inactivation by
receptor stimulation results in a loss of function. Gs-alpha-AVDT was
located primarily in the cytosol except in rat and mouse small intestine
epithelial cells, where it was found predominantly in the membrane, with
adenylyl cyclase present and constitutive increases in cAMP accumulation
occurring in parallel. Makita et al. (2007) suggested that the PHP Ia
phenotype results from the instability of the Gs-alpha-AVDT mutant and
that the accompanying neonatal diarrhea may result from its enhanced
constitutive activity in the intestine.

PSEUDOHYPOPARATHYROIDISM, TYPE IC
GNAS, TYR391TER

In a girl with PHP type Ic (612462), Linglart et al. (2002) identified a
heterozygous mutation in exon 13 of the GNAS gene, resulting in a
tyr319-to-ter (Y391X) substitution only 4 amino acids before the
wildtype stop codon. She had hormone resistance with features of
Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and decreased cAMP response to PTH
infusion, but normal erythrocyte Gs activity. The findings suggested
that the mutation interfered somehow with receptor-mediated activation.
Linglart et al. (2002) noted that the C terminus is required for
receptor coupling, and postulated that the Y391X mutation in this
patient interrupted receptor coupling, leading to hormone resistance.
The findings showed the limits of the erythrocyte Gs bioassay used in
the study.

PSEUDOHYPOPARATHYROIDISM, TYPE IB
GNAS, METHYLATION CHANGES, PATERNAL EPIGENOTYPE

Mariot et al. (2008) studied a girl with obvious Albright osteodystrophy
features, PTH resistance, and normal G-alpha-s bioactivity in red blood
cells (PHP Ib, 603233), yet no loss-of-function mutation in the GNAS
coding sequence. Methylation analysis of the 4 GNAS differentially
methylated regions, i.e., NESP, AS, XL, and A/B, revealed broad
methylation changes at all of these regions, leading to a paternal
epigenotype on both alleles. There was a dramatic decrease of
methylation at exon A/B, XL, and AS promoter regions and therefore
likely biallelic expression of A/B, XL, and AS transcripts. The NESP
region appeared fully methylated in the patient, which was predicted to
result in a dramatic decrease in NESP-specific transcripts. The cause of
the imprinting defect was unknown. Mariot et al. (2008) concluded that:
(1) the decreased expression of G-alpha-s due to GNAS epimutations is
not restricted to the renal tubule but may affect nonimprinted tissues
like bone; and (2) PHP-1b is a heterogeneous disorder that should lead
to the study of GNAS epigenotype in patients with PHP and no mutation in
GNAS exons 1 through 13, regardless of their physical features. They
suggested that Albright osteodystrophy, or at least brachymetacarpia and
obesity, are not specific symptoms of PHP-1a (103580).

In a 12-year-old boy with PHP IC (612462), Thiele et al. (2011)
identified a heterozygous 1163T-G transversion in exon 13 of the GNAS
gene, resulting in a leu388-to-arg (L388R) substitution in a conserved
residue in the alpha-5-helix in the C-terminal part of the protein
directly involved in the contact of Gs-alpha to the G protein-coupled
receptor. The patient had characteristic features of AHO, including
round face, brachymetacarpia, short stature, obesity, and mental
retardation. Serum PTH and TSH were increased and calcium was low. His
mother, who also carried the mutation, had short stature and
brachymetacarpia, but no evidence of hormone resistance. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the L388R mutant protein
caused complete absence of receptor-mediated cAMP production, with
normal receptor-independent cAMP production. The findings indicated
normal Gs-alpha activity, but a selective defect in Gs-alpha-receptor
coupling functions.

In 13-year-old dizygotic twins and an unrelated 5-year-old girl with PHP

transversion in exon 13 of the GNAS gene, resulting in a glu392-to-ter
(E392X) substitution in the alpha-5-helix in the C terminus. The
patients had characteristic features of AHO, including round face,
brachymetacarpia, short stature, and obesity. Serum PTH and TSH were
increased and calcium was low. Both mothers, who also carried the
mutation, had short stature, round face, and/or brachymetacarpia, but no
evidence of hormone resistance. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant protein caused complete absence of
receptor-mediated cAMP production, with normal receptor-independent cAMP
production. The findings indicated normal Gs-alpha activity, but a

alpha-5-helix in the C terminus. The patient had characteristic features
of AHO, including round face, brachymetacarpia, and short stature. Serum
PTH and TSH were increased, but calcium was normal. Her mother, who also
carried the mutation, had short stature and brachymetacarpia, but no
evidence of hormone resistance. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant protein caused a decrease in receptor-mediated

findings indicated normal Gs-alpha activity, but a selective defect in
Gs-alpha-receptor coupling functions.

607931	TITLE *607931 ATAXIN 2-LIKE; ATXN2L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATXN2L associates with the thrombopoietin (TPO; 600044) receptor, MPL
(159530), and is a component of a cytokine signaling cascade following
receptor activation (Meunier et al., 2002).

CLONING

Using the cytoplasmic domain of MPL as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen,
Meunier et al. (2002) isolated a partial clone of ATXN2L from a
megakaryoblast cell line cDNA library. They obtained the full-length
cDNA by probing a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. The deduced protein
contains 1,076 amino acids. Meunier et al. (2002) identified 3 putative
initiation sites and several variants that differ in their C termini.
ATXN2L contains 3 domains that share significant homology with ataxin-2
(601517). The N terminus of ATXN2L has 8 interrupted glutamines
replacing the polyglutamine tract of ataxin-2. Northern blot analysis
detected major ATXN2L transcripts at 4.0 and 4.5 kb expressed at high
levels in thymus, lymph node, spleen, fetal kidney, and adult testis.
ATXN2L was also expressed in several other hematopoietic and fetal
tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Meunier et al. (2002) showed that endogenous ATXN2L was associated with
MPL in a hematopoietic cell line and that ATXN2L interacted specifically
with a 24-amino acid C-terminal segment of the receptor. Thrombopoietin
caused the release of ATXN2L from the activated receptor, and the
phosphorylation of ATXN2L on tyrosine residues by TPO was dependent on
the 24-amino acid C-terminal domain of MPL. ATXN2L also bound to the
unstimulated erythropoietin receptor (133171), and erythropoietin
(133170) caused its dissociation. Meunier et al. (2002) concluded that
ATXN2L is a novel component of the cytokine signaling system.

MAPPING

By FISH, Meunier et al. (2002) mapped the ATXN2L gene to chromosome
16p11 and an ATXN2L pseudogene to chromosome 7p21.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FGF2 (134920) is a highly conserved, multifunctional heparin-binding
growth factor involved in neuroectoderm development, angiogenesis, and
wound healing. Elevated levels of FGF2 are associated with proliferation
of smooth muscle in atherosclerosis and with proliferation of tumors.
The FGF2 antisense gene, NUDT6, may regulate FGF2 expression.

CLONING

By analyzing sequences of the reverse complement of FGF2 cDNA for
homology to frog Fgf2-antisense, followed by RT-PCR, Murphy and Knee
(1994) obtained a cDNA encoding NUDT6, which they called GFG1. The
deduced 150-amino acid GFG1 protein is 74% identical to the frog
antisense protein. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
1.5-kb GFG1 transcript in breast cancer cells, but expression was not
detected in gliomas. Ubiquitous expression of Gfg1 was found in rat
tissues. RT-PCR analysis detected increasing FGF2 levels, but not GFGF1
levels, in glioma cells with increasing cell density, suggesting
independent transcription of the 2 factors. Murphy and Knee (1994)
concluded that there is an inverse relationship between FGF2 and GFG1
expression, indicating that the antisense transcript may regulate FGF2
expression in mammalian tissues.

By screening a Jurkat cDNA library, Gagnon et al. (1999) identified 2
FGF2AS cDNAs encoding splice variants. Using RT-PCR analysis, they
observed that peripheral blood T lymphocytes and T-cell lines
predominantly express FGF2AS, whereas hepatoma cells preferentially
express FGF2. Primer extension analysis of the promoter region of FGF2AS
detected no TATA or CCAAT boxes but found 2 SP1 (189906)-binding sites
and sequences for ETS (see 605255), GATA (see GATA4; 600576), and LYF1
(ZNFN1A1; 603023) transcription factors. Luciferase analysis of mutant
promoters showed that ETS-like transcription factors are most prominent
in the regulation of T-cell FGF2AS expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Asa et al. (2001) showed that human pituitary tumors express FGF2 and
GFG. While normal pituitary expressed GFG but not FGF2, pituitary
adenomas expressed FGF2 and had reduced levels of GFG; aggressive and
recurrent adenomas expressed more FGF2 than GFG mRNA. Transiently and
stably transfected cells expressed the 35-kD GFG protein, which was
localized to the cytoplasm. These cells exhibited enhanced prolactin
(176760) expression. The authors concluded that the GFG protein has
divergent hormone-regulatory and antiproliferative actions in the
pituitary that are independent of FGF2 expression and that GFG
represents a novel mechanism involved in restraining pituitary tumor
cell growth while promoting hormonal activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gagnon et al. (1999) determined that the FGF2AS gene contains 5 exons.
Both splice variants use exons 2 through 5 and differ only in the first
exon, either 1a or 1b.

MAPPING

Using YACs, somatic cell hybrid analysis, and radiation hybrid analysis,
Asa et al. (2001) mapped the NUDT6 gene to 4q25-q27, where the FGF2 gene
is localized.

602971	TITLE *602971 TUBULIN-SPECIFIC CHAPERONE C; TBCC
;;COFACTOR C IN BETA-TUBULIN FOLDING; CFC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequence analysis, Tian et al. (1996) identified yeast homologs of
cofactors D (cin1) and E (pac2), characterized by mutations that affect
microtubule function.

Cofactors essential for the generation of assembly-competent alpha- and
beta-tubulin were identified in in vitro folding reactions (Gao et al.,
1993). Cofactor A was isolated and its sequence deduced from a cloned
cDNA by Gao et al. (1994). Tian et al. (1996) identified cofactors D, E,
and C.

GENE FUNCTION

Microtubules are essential and ubiquitous elements of the cytoskeleton.
Their filamentous arrays contribute to an impressive diversity of
biologic functions that include cell division, intracellular transport,
and the maintenance of cellular architecture. The subunit from which
microtubules are assembled is the tubulin heterodimer, which consists of
1 alpha- and 1 beta-tubulin polypeptide, each of about 50 kD. In vivo
there exists a large class of associated proteins, termed
microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), whose members bind to
microtubules and influence their stability and interaction with other
cellular components. The striking functional diversity of microtubules
depends critically on their dynamic properties and the modulation of
these properties via interaction with MAPs. The first posttranslational
step in the pathway leading to the formation of the tubulin heterodimer
is the folding of newly synthesized alpha- and beta-tubulin polypeptides
into their native configuration. Although in principle proteins contain
within their amino acid sequences all the information that is required
to determine their 3-dimensional structure (Anfinsen, 1973), in many
cases productive folding requires facilitation, an ATP-dependent process
that occurs via interaction with a member of a ubiquitous class of
multisubunit toroidal complexes termed chaperonins. Tian et al. (1996)
described the complete beta-tubulin folding pathway. Folding
intermediates produced via ATP-dependent interaction with cytosolic
chaperonin undergo a sequence of interactions with 4 proteins: cofactors
A, D (604649), E (604934), and C. The postchaperonin steps in the
reaction cascade do not depend on ATP or GTP hydrolysis, although GTP
plays a structural role in tubulin folding. Cofactors A and D function
by capturing and stabilizing beta-tubulin in a quasi-native
conformation. Cofactor E binds to the cofactor D/beta-tubulin complex;
interaction with cofactor C then causes the release of beta-tubulin
polypeptides that are committed to the native state.

Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa-2 gene (RP2; 300757) cause a
severe form of X-linked retinal degeneration (see 312600). RP2 is a
plasma membrane-associated protein which shares homology with TBCC. The
RP2 protein, like cofactor C, stimulates the GTPase activity of tubulin
in combination with cofactor D. RP2 has also been shown to interact with
ADP-ribosylation factor-like-3 (ARL3; 604695) in a nucleotide- and
myristoylation-dependent manner. Grayson et al. (2002) examined the
relationship between RP2, cofactor C, and ARL3 in patient-derived cell
lines and in the retina. In human retina, RP2 was localized to the
plasma membrane in both rod and cone photoreceptors, extending from the
outer segment through the inner segment to the synaptic terminals. In
contrast, cofactor C and ARL3 localized predominantly to the
photoreceptor-connecting cilium in rod and cone photoreceptors. Cofactor
C was cytoplasmic in distribution, whereas ARL3 localized to other
microtubule structures within all cells. Grayson et al. (2002) suggested
that RP2 may function in concert with ARL3 to link the cell membrane
with the cytoskeleton in photoreceptors as part of the cell signaling or
vesicular transport machinery.

600871	TITLE *600871 GROWTH FACTOR-INDEPENDENT 1; GFI1
;;ZNF163
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GFI1 is a transcriptional repressor that is transiently induced during
T-cell differentiation. GFI1 plays critical roles in enhancing T
helper-2 (Th2) cell expansion and in repressing induction of Th17 (see
IL17A; 603149) and CD103 (ITGAE; 604682)-positive inducible regulatory T
(Treg) cells (Zhu et al., 2009).

CLONING

Rat T-cell lymphomas induced by Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV)
are dependent upon interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) for growth in cell
culture. Gilks et al. (1993) grew Mo-MuLV-induced rat T-cell lymphoma
lines in IL-2-free medium in order to select for IL2-independent
mutants. Following selection for an IL2-independent phenotype, they
cloned a full-length cDNA of the gene, symbolized Gfi1 for 'growth
factor independence-1.' They speculated that the GFI1 protein may be
involved in events occurring after the interaction of IL-2 with its
receptor. Indeed, the GFI1 protein may regulate the expression of genes
during S phase of the cell cycle in T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Nolo et al. (2000) identified and characterized the Drosophila
'senseless' (sens) protein, which shares homology with the human GFI1
protein. They found that the sens gene is required for proper
development of most cell types of the embryonic and adult peripheral
nervous system (PNS) of Drosophila. Sens is a nuclear protein with 4
zinc fingers that is expressed and required in the sensory organ
precursors (SOP) for proper proneural gene expression. It shares 87%
amino acid identity with the GFI1 protein in the zinc finger domains.
Ectopic expression of Sens in many ectodermal cells caused induction of
PNS external sensory organ formation and was able to recreate an ectopic
proneural field. Hence, sens is both necessary and sufficient for PNS
development. These data indicated that proneural genes activate sens
expression. Sens is then in turn required to further activate and
maintain proneural gene expression. This feedback mechanism is essential
for selective enhancement and maintenance of proneural gene expression
in the SOPs in Drosophila.

Liu and Cowell (2000) cloned and characterized the human GFI1 promoter.
They found that its nucleotide sequence is GC-rich and does not contain
a typical TATA or CAAT box. Computer predictions indicated that either
of 2 Sp1 sites might serve as the site for transcription initiation.

Using microarray analysis of IL4 (147780)-stimulated and unstimulated
mouse Cd4 T cells, Zhu et al. (2002) identified Gfi1, a Stat6
(601512)-dependent transcriptional repressor, as a strongly induced
immediate-early gene that promoted proliferation of Th2 cells during
their polarization. Prolongation of Gfi1 expression by retroviral
infection resulted in enhanced Il2 (147680)-induced Stat5 (STAT5A;
601511) phosphorylation and repressed p27(Kip1) (CDKN1B; 600778)
expression, as well as greater proliferation. Zhu et al. (2002)
concluded that GFI1, in cooperation with GATA3 (131320), plays a major
role in IL4-driven CD4 T-cell proliferation.

As indicated later, Gfi1-deficient mice, produced by gene targeting, are
neutropenic. Furthermore, Person et al. (2003) demonstrated that
heritable GFI1 mutations cause human neutropenia. Mutant GFI1 in these
cases fails to repress ELA2 (130130), encoding neutrophil elastase,
mutations of which are the major cause of inherited human neutropenia
syndromes. In both mice and humans with GFI1 mutations, myeloid
progenitor cells fail to differentiate to mature neutrophils, causing
the accumulation of monocytes and abnormal cells that blend features of
monocytes and granulocytes. Only 1 cellular promoter had been known to
be repressed by GFI1, that for the antiapoptotic factor BAX (600040). To
identify genes regulated by GFI1 during hematopoiesis in vivo, Duan and
Horwitz (2003) performed large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays. They found that GFI1 binds to a functionally diverse set
of genes acting concertedly during hematopoietic differentiation.

Hock et al. (2004) reported that GFI1 restricted proliferation of
hematopoietic stem cells. After loss of GFI1, hematopoietic stem cells
displayed elevated proliferation rates as assessed by
5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and cell cycle analysis. Gfi1 null
hematopoietic stem cells were functionally compromised in competitive
repopulation and serial transplantation assays and were rapidly
outcompeted in the bone marrow of mouse chimeras generated with Gfi1
null embryonic stem cells. Hock et al. (2004) concluded that GFI1 is
essential to restrict hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and to
preserve functional integrity.

Using mouse mutants, Zeng et al. (2004) showed that Gfi1 was
differentially expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and subsets of
hematopoietic progenitor cells, and that loss of Gfi1 resulted in
significant alteration of stem and precursor cell frequencies.
Functional assays showed that Gfi1 maintained hematopoietic stem cell
self-renewal, multilineage differentiation, and efficient reconstitution
of hematopoiesis in transplanted hosts by restricting stem cell
proliferation.

By coimmunoprecipitation assays with mouse and human cells, Saleque et
al. (2007) showed that LSD1 (AOF2; 609132), COREST (RCOR; 607675), HDAC1
(601241), and HDAC2 (605164) interacted with both GFI1 and GFI1B
(604383) in endogenous complexes. The N-terminal SNAG repression domain
of GFI1 and GFI1B was required for their association with COREST and
LSD1. Mouse Gfi1b recruited these cofactors to the majority of target
gene promoters in vivo. Inhibition of Corest and Lsd1 perturbed
differentiation of mouse erythroid, megakaryocytic, and granulocytic
cells, as well as primary erythroid progenitors. Lsd1 depletion
derepressed GFI targets in lineage-specific patterns, accompanied by
enhanced histone-3 (see 602810) lys4 methylation at the respective
promoters. Saleque et al. (2007) concluded that GFI complexes catalyze
serial histone modification of their targets, leading to their graded
silencing.

MAPPING

Bell et al. (1995) mapped the GFI1 gene to mouse chromosome 5 by linkage
analysis and mapped the GFI1 gene to rat chromosome 14p22 and to human
chromosome 1p22 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The assignment to
chromosome 1 was confirmed using a mapping-panel blot.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mice lacking the transcriptional repressor oncoprotein Gfi1 are
unexpectedly neutropenic (Karsunky et al., 2002; Hock et al., 2003).
Person et al. (2003) screened GFI1 as a candidate for association with
neutropenia in individuals without mutations in ELA2 (130130), the most
common cause of autosomal dominant severe congenital neutropenia (SCN1;
202700). They found dominant-negative zinc finger mutations that
disabled transcriptional repressor activity. The phenotype also included
immunodeficient lymphocytes and production of a circulating population
of myeloid cells that appeared immature. They showed by chromatin
immunoprecipitation, gel shift, reporter assays, and elevated expression
of ELA2 in vivo in neutropenic individuals that GFI1 represses ELA2,
thus linking these 2 genes in a common pathway involved in myeloid
differentiation. The 2 amino acid substitutions found in cases of
neutropenia by Person et al. (2003) involved amino acids identical in
Gfi1 homologs in divergent species and also conserved in the paralog
GFI1B. One of the mutations was found in individuals with SCN2 (613107),
and the other mutation was found in an individual with nonimmune chronic
idiopathic neutropenia of adults (607847).

ANIMAL MODEL

Karsunky et al. (2002) found that Gfi1 is expressed outside the lymphoid
system in granulocytes and activated macrophages, cells that mediate
innate immunity (i.e., nonspecific immunity). They generated
Gfi1-deficient mice (Gfi1 -/-) and showed that these animals are
severely neutropenic and accumulate immature monocytic cells in blood
and bone marrow. Their myeloid precursor cells were unable to
differentiate into granulocytes upon stimulation with granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (138970) but could develop into mature
macrophages. They found that macrophages of the Gfi1-null animals
produced enhanced levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor
necrosis factor (191160), interleukin-10 (124092), and
interleukin-1-beta (147720), when stimulated with bacterial
lipopolysaccharide, and that Gfi1-null mice succumb to low doses of this
endotoxin that were tolerated by wildtype mice. They concluded that Gfi1
influences the differentiation of myeloid precursors into granulocytes
or monocytes and acts in limiting the inflammatory immune response.

A mutation of the POU4F3 gene (602460) underlies human autosomal
dominant nonsyndromic progressive hearing loss (DFNA15; 602459). By
comparing inner ear gene expression profiles of embryonic day 16.5
wildtype and Pou4f3-mutant deaf mice, Hertzano et al. (2004) identified
the GFI1 gene as a target gene regulated by Pou4f3. Deficiency of Pou4f3
led to a reduction in Gfi1 expression levels, and the dynamics of Gfi1
mRNA abundance closely followed the pattern of expression for Pou4f3.
Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses revealed that loss of
Gfi1 resulted in outer hair cell degeneration, which appeared comparable
to that observed in Pou4f3 mutants. Hertzano et al. (2004) concluded
that GFI1 is the first downstream target of a hair cell-specific
transcription factor, and they suggested that outer hair cell
degeneration in Pou4f3 mutants may be largely or entirely a result of
the loss of expression of GFI1.

Zhu et al. (2006) tested the physiologic function of Gfi1 in peripheral
T cells by generating conditional Gfi1-knockout mice. Deletion of Gfi
impaired proliferation and increased apoptosis of Th2 cells, but not Th1
cells, in vitro and in vivo in response to Il2. Overexpression of Stat5
failed to restore normal Th2 expansion in Gfi1-deficient cells. Mutant
mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni had a reduced frequency of Il4
(147780)-producing cells, whereas Th1 responses to Toxoplasma gondii
were unimpaired.

Zhu et al. (2009) generated conditional knockout mice in which Gfi1 was
deleted only in T cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, flow cytometric,
and RT-PCR analyses demonstrated defects in Th2 cell expansion and
enhanced Ifng (147570) production in the mutant mice. Il4-induced Gfi1
expression inhibited Il17 (603149) production, but not induction of
Ror-gamma-t (602943) in cells primed with Tgfb (190180) plus Il6
(147620). Gfi1 also limited Tgfb-mediated differentiation of inducible
Treg cells. In the absence of Gfi1, the percentage of natural Treg cells
expressing Cd103 and Foxp3 (300292) was increased. Gfi1 expression was
also downregulated by Tgfb. Zhu et al. (2009) concluded that GFI1 plays
a critical role both in enhancing Th2 cell expansion and in the
epigenetic regulation of Th17 and Cd103-positive inducible Treg cell
differentiation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEUTROPENIA, SEVERE CONGENITAL, 2, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
GFI1, ASN382SER

Person et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 1412A-G transition in the
GFI1 gene causing an asn382-to-ser (N382S) substitution in the fifth
zinc finger in a 4-month-old boy with severe congenital neutropenia
(SCN2; 613107) who had a neutrophil count of zero and marked
monocytosis. The mutation segregated with his 3-year-old paternal half
brother, who was identically affected, and with their father, who had
recurrent pneumonia and pyogenic abscesses abating during childhood. The
father's childhood blood counts were not available, but at age 27 his
neutrophil count was low and monocytes high. His peripheral blood showed
a population of myeloid cells that appeared immature. The myeloid, but
not erythroid, colony formation potential of his cultured peripheral
blood was lower than normal; nonerythroid colonies had intact
differentiation to monocytes or macrophages but had an excess of myeloid
precursors with no mature neutrophils. The absolute cell number of CD4 T
lymphocytes was reduced. Moreover, B lymphocytes were also reduced.
Peripheral blood lymphocytes from both the father and the older son
showed similar trends, and both had poor uptake of 3H-thymidine after
stimulation with phytohemagglutinin, alloantigen, and Candida albicans
compared with normal individuals. Nonetheless, the child had adequate
circulating titers to immunizations, and all immunoglobulin isotypes
were present in his serum, indicating that, though reduced in number and
activation potential, the T and B lymphocyte populations were
functional. Person et al. (2003) demonstrated that GFI1 represses ELA2
(130130), mutant in most cases of autosomal dominant severe congenital
neutropenia, linking these 2 genes in a common pathway involved in
myeloid differentiation.

.0002
NEUTROPENIA, NONIMMUNE CHRONIC IDIOPATHIC, OF ADULTS
GFI1, LYS403ARG

Nonimmune chronic idiopathic neutropenia of adults (NI-CINA; 607847) is
manifested by neutropenia milder than that in severe congenital
neutropenia (see SCN2; 613107), is diagnosed in adults, and also
predisposes to leukemia in a subset of patients (Papadaki et al., 2002).
Person et al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for a 1475A-G transition
in GFI1, causing the amino acid substitution lys403-to-arg (K403R) in
the sixth zinc finger. The patient had been found to be neutropenic 10
years earlier and thereafter had persistently low neutrophil count and
elevated monocytes. Analysis for acquired causes had proven negative,
including drug exposures and autoimmune serologies (antibodies against
nuclear antigens, against double-stranded DNA, against polymorphonuclear
leukocytes, and against rheumatoid factors). She was not known ever to
have had a normal blood count. There was no history of infectious
complications. There were no living close relatives.

608208	TITLE *608208 MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED RING-CH FINGER PROTEIN 4; MARCH4
;;MARCH IV;;
KIAA1399
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MARCH4 is a member of the MARCH family of membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin
ligases (EC 6.3.2.19). MARCH enzymes add ubiquitin (see 191339) to
target lysines in substrate proteins, thereby signaling their vesicular
transport between membrane compartments. MARCH4 reduces surface
accumulation of several membrane glycoproteins by directing them to the
endosomal compartment (Bartee et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KIAA1399. The deduced protein
contains 452 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in whole
adult brain and moderate expression in fetal brain, fetal liver, spinal
cord, and all individual adult brain regions examined.

Poxviruses and gamma-2 herpesviruses express ubiquitin ligases called K3
proteins that inhibit the surface expression of glycoproteins, including
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (see 142800).
By searching a database for sequences similar to the functional domains
of viral K3 proteins, Bartee et al. (2004) identified 9 human MARCH
proteins, including MARCH4. The deduced MARCH4 protein contains a short
N terminus, followed by a RING-CH domain and 2 transmembrane domains.
MARCH4 shares 90% identity with MARCH9 (613336) in the RING-CH and
transmembrane domains. Real-time PCR high expression in brain and
placenta, weak expression in lung and pancreas, and little to no
expression in other tissues examined. Immunofluorescence analysis showed
that epitope-tagged MARCH4 colocalized with markers of the Golgi
apparatus.

GENE FUNCTION

Gong et al. (2003) described a large-scale screen to create an atlas of
CNS gene expression at the cellular level, and to provide a library of
verified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors and transgenic
mouse lines that offer experimental access to CNS regions, cell classes,
and pathways. They found that P271, a novel protein with a single
proline-rich domain that is closely related to human KIAA1399, is
expressed predominantly in layer 2 and 5 pyramidal cells. The morphology
of expressing cells was clearly evident, including the ramifications of
basal dendrites within layer 5 and extension of the apical dendrite and
its elaboration within layer 1 of the developing and adult cortex.

Bartee et al. (2004) showed that the isolated RING-CH domain of MARCH4
functioned as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in a reaction containing ubiquitin,
ATP, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (see UBE1; 314370), and the E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH2 (UBE2H; 601082), but not other E2
enzymes examined. Following transfection into HeLa cells, MARCH4
downregulated the surface expression of cotransfected CD4 (186940) and
endogenous MHC I. Mutation analysis revealed that the RING-CH domain of
MARCH4 was required for downregulation of MHC I surface expression, and
additional sequences in the MARCH4 N- and C-terminal ends contributed to
internalization. MHC I was internalized to lysosomes via multivesicular
bodies, and inhibition of endosome acidification or expression of a
dominant-negative VPS4 (see 609982) mutant abrogated MARCH4-induced MHC
I internalization. Deletion of lysines in the tails of HLA-A2.1 (600642)
and CD4 made these proteins resistant to MARCH9-induced degradation,
suggesting that ubiquitination of these lysines is required for their
uptake and degradation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
KIAA1399 gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP SGC32061).

609290	TITLE *609290 ADENYLATE KINASE 3; AK3
;;ADENYLATE KINASE 3-LIKE 1, FORMERLY; AK3L1, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using primers based on the conserved region of mitochondrial Ak3 cDNA
from bovine, rat, and mouse, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Noma
et al. (2001) cloned human AK3 from a liver cDNA library. The deduced
227-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 25.6 kD. AK3
shares 57.4% amino acid identity with AK4 (AK3L1; 103030). It shares
75%, 90%, and 91% amino acid identity with bovine, rat, and mouse Ak3,
respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.2-kb transcript in all
tissues examined. Expression was highest in heart, liver, and skeletal
muscle, moderate in kidney and pancreas, and weak in brain, placenta,
and lung. Transcripts of 5, 1.8, and 1.35 kb were detected in heart,
liver, and pancreas. Western blot analysis detected AK3 at an apparent
molecular mass of 28 kD in all tissues examined. Subcellular
fractionation of mouse liver and kidney detected Ak3 in the
mitochondrial fraction.

GENE FUNCTION

Noma et al. (2001) assayed recombinant AK3 expressed in E. coli and
showed that the enzyme had GTP:ATP phosphotransferase activity. Human
embryonic kidney cells had endogenous phosphotransferase activity, which
increased following transfection of AK3 cDNA.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Povey et al. (1976) assigned the AK3
gene to chromosome 9. The smallest region of overlap for AK3 was
estimated to be 9p24-p13 (Robson and Meera Khan, 1982).

By interspecific backcross linkage analysis, Pilz et al. (1995) mapped
the Ak3 gene to mouse chromosome 4.

138322	TITLE *138322 GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE 4; GPX4
;;PHOSPHOLIPID HYDROPEROXIDE GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE; PHGPX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GPX4 reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides within membranes and
lipoproteins and acts in conjunction with alpha-tocopherol to inhibit
lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is implicated in a number of
pathophysiologic processes, including inflammation and atherogenesis.
GPX4 is a selenoprotein whose production and activity are sensitive to
selenium (Se), which is incorporated into selenoproteins as
selenocysteine (summary by Sneddon et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using porcine Phgpx to screen a testis cDNA library, Esworthy et al.
(1994) cloned human GPX4, which they called PHGPX. The 3-prime UTR
contains a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) required for
insertion of selenocysteine at an opal codon (UGA). The deduced
197-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 19 kD. It has
putative active-site tryptophan and glutamic acid residues that are
predicted to interact with selenocysteine, and a tyrosine residue that
is phosphorylated in the porcine protein.

By fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy of resting human
platelets, Januel et al. (2006) showed that GPX4 associated with
membranes, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, and that GPX4 activity showed an
identical distribution. Western blot analysis detected GPX4 at an
apparent molecular mass of 20 to 21 kD.

Roveri et al. (1992) found that rat Gpx4 was present primarily in
testis. Januel et al. (2006) stated that rat has mitochondrial and
nonmitochondrial forms of Gpx4.

Borchert et al. (2003) characterized the expression of 2 major isoforms
of Gpx4 in mouse tissues. One isoform, which they designated the
phospholipid (phGpx) form, was expressed in many tissues. The other,
designated the sperm nucleus (snGpx) isoform, was detected in mouse
testis and kidney, as well as in a human embryonic kidney cell line.
Subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy revealed
cytosolic localization. Immunohistochemical staining of mouse kidneys
showed staining for snGpx in cortical and medullary interstitial cells.
Analysis of the 5-prime flanking region common to both isoforms revealed
strong promoter activity. The snGpx4 promoter, which contains 334 bp of
intronic sequence, suppressed the activity of the common promoter.

GENE FUNCTION

In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), Sneddon et al.
(2003) observed a dose-dependent increase in GPX4 mRNA and protein
levels with increasing Se concentration until the Se concentration
reached 76 nM. GPX4 enzyme activity was optimum at an even higher Se
concentration. Sneddon et al. (2003) noted that these findings
contrasted with findings in other tissues and cell types, suggesting
that Se regulates GPX4 in a tissue- and cell-type specific manner,
possibly reflecting the relative importance of GPX4 in individual
tissues. They also found that, in addition to Se, fatty acids,
cytokines, and redox state regulated GPX4 expression and activity, but
sometimes in different and opposing ways.

Activation of platelets by agonists such as thrombin (F2; 176930) leads
to a dramatic increase in cell surface expression of several receptors,
as well as changes in platelet shape, release of arachidonic acid from
phospholipids, and increased level of peroxides. Using fractionated
human platelets and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, Januel et
al. (2006) found that GPX4 protein and enzymatic activity redistributed
from the cytosol to membranes following platelet activation. They
hypothesized that mobilization of GPX4 toward membranes protects
platelets against the burst of lipid hydroperoxides and limits the stage
of activation.

By yeast 3-hybrid screening of a mouse testis cDNA library, followed by
RNA mobility gel shift assays, Ufer et al. (2008) found that the
RNA-binding protein Grsf1 (604851) bound an AGGGGA motif in the 5-prime
UTR of mitochondrial Gpx4. Grsf1 upregulated Gpx4 UTR-dependent reporter
gene expression, recruited mitochondrial Gpx4 mRNA to translationally
active polysomes, and coimmunoprecipitated with Gpx4 mRNA. During
embryonic mouse brain development, Grsf1 and mitochondrial Gpx4 were
coexpressed, and knockdown of Grsf1 via small interfering RNA prevented
embryonic Gpx4 expression. Compared with mock controls, Grsf1-knockdown
embryos showed developmental retardation that paralleled increased
apoptosis and massive lipid peroxidation. Overexpression of
mitochondrial Gpx4 prevented the apoptotic changes and rescued
development in Grsf1-knockdown embryos. Ufer et al. (2008) concluded
that GRSF1 upregulates translation of GPX4 mRNA and that both proteins
are required for embryonic brain development.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

To overcome inefficient selenocysteine-incorporating machinery in
recombinant systems, Scheerer et al. (2007) expressed recombinant human
cytosolic GPX4 containing a sec46-to-cys (U46C) mutation, which retains
residual catalytic activity, in E. coli. They solved the crystal
structure of this molecule to 1.55-angstrom resolution. X-ray data
indicated that the monomeric protein consisted of 4 alpha helices and 7
beta strands. The catalytic triad (cys46, gln81, and trp136) localized
at a flat impression on the protein surface extending into a
surface-exposed patch of basic amino acids (lys48, lys135, and arg152)
that also contained polar thr139. Mutation analysis confirmed the
functional importance of the catalytic triad. Like the wildtype enzyme,
the U46C mutant exhibited a strong tendency toward polymerization, which
was prevented by reductants. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested
involvement of the catalytic cys46 and surface-exposed cys10 and cys66
in polymer formation. In GPX4 crystals, these residues contacted
adjacent protein monomers.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kelner and Montoya (1998) determined that the human GPX4 gene spans 2.8
kb and contains 7 exons. Analysis of the gene sequence identified a
potential alternative tissue-specific first exon.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of genomic DNA from human/hamster somatic cell
hybrids, Chu (1994) showed that the GPX4 gene is located on chromosome
19. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kelner and Montoya (1998)
assigned the gene to chromosome 19p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Villette et al. (2002) examined the 3-prime UTR of the GPX4 gene in 66
healthy Scottish volunteers and identified a T-C SNP at position 718,
near the predicted SECIS element. The distribution of this SNP was in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, with 34% CC homozygotes, 25% TT homozygotes,
and 41% TC heterozygotes. Individuals of different genotypes exhibited
significant differences in the levels of lymphocyte 5-lipoxygenase total
products, with CC homozygotes showing 36% and 44% more products than TT
homozygotes and TC heterozygotes, respectively. Villette et al. (2002)
concluded that GPX4 has a regulatory role in leukotriene biosynthesis
and that the 718T-C SNP has functional effects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ran et al. (2004) stated that Gpx4 deletion in mice is embryonic lethal,
and that embryonic fibroblasts from Gpx4 +/- mice exhibit increased
lipid peroxidation, more cell death after exposure to oxidizing agents,
and growth retardation under high oxygen levels. They found that
expression of human GPX4 rescued the lethal phenotype of Gpx4 -/- mice.
Transgenic mice overexpressing human GPX4 showed reduced oxidative
injury after oxidative stress.

157132	TITLE *157132 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 4; MAP4
DESCRIPTION Chapin and Bulinski (1991) used a polyclonal antiserum raised against a
HeLa cell microtubule-associated protein of M(r) 210,000 (210-kD MAP or
MAP4), an abundant nonneuronal MAP, to isolate cDNA clones from a human
fetal brain lambda gt11 cDNA expression library. They found that this,
the major human nonneuronal MAP, resembles 2 neuronal MAPs in its
microtubule-binding domain, while most of the molecule has sequences,
and presumably functions, distinct from those of the neuronal MAPs
(e.g., 157130).

West et al. (1991) reported the structure of MAP4 on the basis of
comparisons of the human, mouse, and bovine sequences.

Chapin et al. (1995) isolated clones encoding alternatively spliced
forms of MAP4. One isoform is similar to an isoform of tau (157140) in
structure. The authors mapped human MAP4 gene to 3p21 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Mangan and Olmsted (1996) demonstrated that the
murine homolog is located on mouse chromosome 9.

605255	TITLE *605255 ETS VARIANT GENE 7; ETV7
;;ETS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TEL2; TEL2;;
TELB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family of transcription factors,
of which ETV7 is a member, is a large group of evolutionarily conserved
transcriptional regulators that play an important role in a variety of
cellular processes throughout development and differentiation, and are
involved in oncogenesis as well (Potter et al., 2000).

CLONING

Potter et al. (2000) sequenced cDNA clones corresponding to a novel ETS
gene from an activated T-cell cDNA library, as well as from breast
tissue and meningioma cDNA libraries. The cDNA, which the authors
designated TEL2, encodes a deduced 341-amino acid protein that shares
38% sequence identity with TEL1 (ETV6; 600618). TEL2 contains a
C-terminal ETS domain and an N-terminal PNT domain, which is thought to
mediate protein-protein interactions. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of TEL2 mRNA predominantly in hematopoietic tissues; a
predominant band of approximately 1.2 kb was present in fetal liver and
bone marrow and was faintly present in peripheral blood leukocytes.
Using antibodies raised against the C terminus of the TEL2 protein,
Potter et al. (2000) showed that TEL2 localizes to the nucleus. The
striking similarities of TEL2 to TEL1, its expression in hematopoietic
tissues, and its ability to associate with TEL1 suggested that TEL2 may
be an important hematopoietic regulatory protein.

Poirel et al. (2000) identified the TELB gene by comparison of the TEL
sequence with genomic sequence databases. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of TELB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Potter et al. (2000) determined that the TEL2 gene contains 8 exons
spanning approximately 21 kb.

611012	TITLE *611012 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING-LIKE 1; RGSL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by screening of EST databases, and
5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Silva et al. (2003) identified RGSL1. The
deduced 500-amino acid protein contains a 120-amino acid regulator of G
protein signaling (RGS) domain and shares 84.2% similarity with the
mouse homolog. RT-PCR of human tissues detected high expression in
testis with lower expression in bone marrow and prostate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Silva et al. (2003) determined that the RGSL1 gene contains 15 exons
spanning 67.1 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Silva et al. (2003) mapped the RGSL1 gene
to chromosome 1q25.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The An1, An2, and An11 loci control the pigmentation of petunias by
stimulating transcription of anthocyanin genes. By Southern blot
analysis with a petunia An11 probe, followed by EST database searching
and PCR, de Vetten et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA encoding human AN11.
The deduced 342-amino acid, WD repeat-containing protein is 53%
identical to the petunia An11 protein and is conserved in worms and
yeast, which do not produce anthocyanins. Functional analysis showed
that human AN11 could partially complement a petunia An11 mutant. De
Vetten et al. (1997) concluded that An11 is involved in signal
transduction in petunias.

605454	TITLE *605454 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 10; ABCB10
;;MITOCHONDRIAL ABC PROTEIN 2; MABC2; MTABC2
DESCRIPTION For background information on the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of
transporter proteins, see ABCA4 (601691).

CLONING

In addition to the 'full' ABC transporters with 2 transmembrane domains
and 2 nucleotide-binding domains, there are 'half' proteins that contain
only 1 of each domain (e.g., ABCB1; 171050). By screening an acute
lymphoblastic leukemia cDNA library and a genomic DNA library with an
EST probe, Zhang et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding ABCB10, a
738-amino acid half transporter. Phylogenetic analysis determined that
ABCB10 is well conserved and most similar to human MABC1 (ABCB8;
605464). Northern blot analysis detected a 4.0-kb transcript in all
tissues tested, with highest levels in bone marrow, low levels in lung,
kidney, spleen, thymus, and colon, and intermediate levels in all other
tissues. Western blot and confocal microscopy analyses showed that
ABCB10 was expressed as a 60-kD nonglycosylated mitochondrial membrane
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Chen et al.
(2009) showed that the mouse mitochondrial iron transporter Mfrn1
(SLC25A37; 610387) interacted with Abcb10. Cotransfection of Abcb10 with
Mfrn1 in COS-7 cells enhanced the half-life of Mfrn1. Conversely,
knockdown of Abcb10 via small interfering RNA caused Mfrn1 instability.
Coexpression of Abcb10 with Mfrn1 in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells
increased total mitochondrial uptake of radiolabeled Fe, but it did not
alter the incorporation of Fe into heme. Use of Mfrn1-Mfrn2 (SLC25A28;
609767) chimeras localized the Abcb10-interacting domain to the
N-terminal region of Mfrn1. Chen et al. (2009) observed that proteolytic
processing of Abcb10 and targeting of Abcb10 to the mitochondrial
membrane paralleled induction of Mfrn1 protein during MEL cell
differentiation. Chen et al. (2009) concluded that formation of the
MFRN1-ABCB10 complex stabilizes MFRN1, resulting in increased
mitochondrial iron incorporation.

MAPPING

Allikmets et al. (1995) mapped a partial EST corresponding to the ABCB10
gene to chromosome 1q42. However, using FISH, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped
the full-length ABCB10 gene to chromosome 15q13-q14. PCR and Southern
blot analysis of genomic DNA showed that the chromosome 15 localization
represents a pseudogene.

610868	TITLE *610868 LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 2; LRRTM2
;;KIAA0416
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned LRRTM2, which they designated
KIAA0416. The deduced 516-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 55 kD and shares 35.2% identity with the mouse acid-labile
subunit (IGFALS; 601489). RT-PCR detected highest expression in kidney
and weaker expression in brain, placenta, lung, liver, thymus, testis
and ovary, and little to no expression in other tissues examined.

By database analysis using the leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) of the SLIT
(see SLIT1; 603742) proteins, followed by RT-PCR of brain RNA, Lauren et
al. (2003) cloned LRRTM2. The deduced 516-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal signal sequence, followed by 10 extracellular LRRs flanked by
cysteine-rich domains, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular
tail. LRRTM2 has 5 N-glycosylation sites, several putative
phosphorylation sites, and a C terminus that ends in the sequence ECEV,
which is a characteristic of LRRTM family members. Lauren et al. (2003)
also identified mouse Lrrtm2, which shares 98% identity with human
LRRTM2. RT-PCR analysis detected prominent LRRTM2 expression in human
brain, including amygdala, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, corpus callosum,
hippocampus, and thalamus, and lower expression in all other human
tissues examined except bone marrow. In developing mice, Lrrtm2
expression began at embryonic day 15, increased at postnatal day 1, and
remained high into adulthood. In situ hybridization of adult mouse brain
detected widespread Lrrtm2 expression predominantly in neurons.

GENE FUNCTION

Ko et al. (2009) stated that LRRTMs are synaptic cell adhesion
molecules. Using an artificial synapse formation assay, they showed
that, similar to neuroligin-1 (NLGN1; 600568), rat Lrrtm2 induced
formation of presynaptic terminals on transfected COS-7 cells that were
contacted by cocultured rat hippocampal neurons. However, Lrrtm2 induced
only excitatory synapses, whereas neuroligin-1 induced both excitatory
and inhibitory synapses. Overexpression of Lrrtm2 in rat hippocampal
neurons increased the number of presynaptic excitatory synapses, but it
had no effect on postsynaptic structures. Affinity chromatography
revealed that Lrrtm2 bound the alpha and beta isoforms of all 3
neurexins (see NRXN1; 600565). Cell surface labeling and cell adhesion
assays showed that Lrrtm2 only interacted with neurexin-1 alpha and beta
isoforms lacking a short sequence in the membrane-proximal lamin G
domain encoded by an insert at splice site-4. Pull-down assays revealed
that Lrrtm2 and neuroligin-1 could not simultaneously bind to the
neurexin-1 beta isoform. Ko et al. (2009) concluded that LRRTM2 binds to
presynaptic neurexins in a tight interaction that is regulated by
alternative splicing of neurexins at splice site-4.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lauren et al. (2003) determined that the LRRTM2 gene contains 2 coding
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the LRRTM2
gene to chromosome 5.

By genomic sequence analysis, Lauren et al. (2003) mapped the LRRTM2
gene to chromosome 5q31.2, where it lies on the opposite strand within
intron 6 of the CTNNA1 gene (116805). They mapped the mouse Lrrtm2 gene
to chromosome 18B3, which shares homology of synteny with human
chromosome 5q31.2.

DELETIONS OF GUANINE-RICH DNA, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF;;
DOG1, HOMOLOG OF;;
FANCJ GENE; FANCJ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cantor et al. (2001) showed that BRCA1 (113705) interacts in vivo with a
novel protein, BRIP1, which they called BACH1 (BRCA1-associated
C-terminal helicase-1), a member of the DEAH helicase family. The
predicted 1,249-amino acid BRIP1 protein contains the 7
helicase-specific motifs that are conserved among members of the DEAH
family, and the helicase domain includes a nuclear localization signal.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of BRIP1, with
highest levels in testis, an expression pattern similar to that of
BRCA1.

GENE FUNCTION

Cantor et al. (2001) demonstrated that BRIP1 binds directly to the BRCT
repeats of BRCA1. A BRIP1 derivative, bearing a mutation in a residue
that is essential for catalytic function in other helicases, interfered
with normal double-strand break repair in a manner that was dependent on
its BRCA1-binding function. Thus, the authors concluded that BRIP1-BRCA1
complex formation contributes to a key BRCA1 activity.

Genes that contribute to tumorigenesis can be broadly classified as
either gatekeepers or caretakers (Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1997). Genes
in the gatekeeper class directly regulate cell division or cell death,
and their alteration results in the uncontrolled cellular proliferation
that characterizes tumor cells. Genes in the caretaker class are
involved in DNA metabolic processes and are responsible for maintaining
the overall stability of the genome. The inherent stability of DNA
sequences varies widely, with some types of sequences being classified
as 'at risk motifs' (ARMs) that are particularly prone to accumulating
mutations or promoting genome rearrangements. One structural feature of
intact genomes is runs of homopolymeric dC/dG. Cheung et al. (2002)
described an unusual mutator phenotype in Caenorhabditis elegans
characterized by deletions that start around the 3-prime end of
polyguanine tracts and terminate at variable positions 5-prime from such
tracts. They observed deletions throughout genomic DNA in about half of
polyguanine tracts examined, especially those containing 22 or more
consecutive guanine nucleotides. The mutator phenotype resulted from
disruption of a gene that encodes a protein with characteristics of a
DEAH helicase, which Cheung et al. (2002) named dog1 (deletions of
guanine-rich DNA). Nematodes mutated in dog1 showed germline as well as
somatic deletions in genes containing polyguanine tracts. They proposed
that dog1 is required to resolve the secondary structures of
guanine-rich DNA that occasionally form during lagging-strand DNA
synthesis. Jinks-Robertson (2002), who referred to dog1 as 'the genome's
best friend,' pointed to BACH1 as the structurally most closely related
protein in humans and raised the possibility that targeted mutations in
BACH1 might show the mutational signature seen in dog1 mutant nematodes.

Yu et al. (2003) demonstrated that the BRCT domain of BRCA1 directly
interacts with phosphorylated BACH1. The specific interaction between
BRCA1 and phosphorylated BACH1 is cell cycle regulated and is required
for DNA damage-induced checkpoint control during the transition from G2
to M phase of the cell cycle. Further, Yu et al. (2003) showed that 2
other BRCT domains interact with their respective physiologic partners
in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Thirteen additional BRCT domains
also preferentially bind phosphopeptides rather than nonphosphorylated
control peptides. Yu et al. (2003) concluded that their data implied
that the BRCT domain is a phosphoprotein-binding domain involved in cell
cycle control.

Cantor et al. (2004) determined that BRIP1 is both a DNA-dependent
ATPase and a 5-prime-to-3-prime DNA helicase. Helicase activity was
strictly ATP dependent and was inhibited by the addition of EDTA,
consistent with a requirement for cations. BRIP1 unwound DNA:DNA
substrates and RNA:DNA hybrid substrates, but it did not unwind
double-stranded RNA. BRIP1 carrying a lys52-to-arg mutation lacked
ATPase activity, failed to be stimulated by single-stranded DNA, and was
inactive in an unwinding assay. BRIP1 with the clinically relevant
mutation pro47 to ala (P47A; 605882.0001) showed no detectable ATPase
activity and complete loss of function, whereas BRIP1 with the
clinically relevant mutation met299 to ile (M299I; 605882.0002) showed
elevated ATPase activity, but had limited ability to unwind DNA
substrates of more than 19 basepairs.

Bridge et al. (2005) cloned the chicken ortholog of BRIP1 and
established a homologous knockout in the avian B-cell line DT40. The
phenotype of these brip1 mutant cells in response to DNA damage differed
from that of brca1 mutant cells and more closely resembled that of fancc
(613899) mutant cells, with a profound sensitivity to the
DNA-crosslinking agent cisplatin and acute cell-cycle arrest in late
S-G2 phase. These defects were corrected by expression of human BRIP1
lacking the BRCT interaction domain. Moreover, in human cells exposed to
mitomycin C, short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of BRIP1 led to a
substantial increase in chromosome aberrations, a characteristic
phenotype of cells derived from individuals with Fanconi anemia (see
FANCJ; 609054). Because brip1 mutant cells are proficient for the
ubiquitination of FANCD2 protein (613984), these data indicated that
brip1 has a function in the Fanconi anemia pathway that is independent
of BRCA1 and downstream of FANCD2 activation.

Gupta et al. (2007) found that FANCJ immunoprecipitated with RPA (see
RPA70, or RPA1; 179835), a multiprotein single-stranded DNA-binding
complex implicated in DNA replication and repair. FANCJ and RPA
colocalized in nuclear foci after DNA damage or replication stress.
FANCJ and RPA bound with high affinity via the RPA70 subunit. Although
FANCJ showed limited ability to unwind even a 47-bp forked duplex, the
presence of RPA enabled FANCJ to act as a much more processive helicase.

MAPPING

By genomic analysis, Cantor et al. (2001) mapped the BRIP1 gene to
chromosome 17q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Susceptibility to Breast Cancer

Cantor et al. (2001) identified germline BRIP1 mutations affecting the
helicase domain in 2 of 65 patients with early-onset breast cancer
(114480), of whom 35 had a strong family history of breast and/or
ovarian cancer but lacked mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2
(600185) genes. The mutations were not found in 200 matched controls.
The authors concluded that like BRCA1, BRIP1 may be a target of germline
cancer-inducing mutations.

Seal et al. (2006) identified constitutional truncating mutations of the
BRCA1-interacting helicase BRIP1 in 9 of 1,212 individuals with breast
cancer from BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation-negative families but in only 2 of
2,081 controls (p = 0.0030). They estimated that BRIP1 mutations confer
a relative risk of breast cancer of 2.0 (95% confidence interval =
1.2-3.2). Thus, as in the case of BRCA2, inactivating truncating
mutations of BRIP1 cause Fanconi anemia in biallelic carriers and confer
susceptibility to breast cancer in monoallelic carriers. Of note,
biallelic mutations of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 cause
Fanconi anemia complementation group D1 (605724) (Litman et al., 2005).

- Fanconi Anemia, Complementation Group J

Using genetic mapping, mutation identification, and Western blot data,
Levran et al. (2005) identified the defective protein in FA-J cells
(FANCJ; 609054) as BRIP1. Genome scans identified a statistically
significant region of homozygosity of 6 Mb on 17q23. In this region, 2
affected Inuit sibs shared the same haplotype for 48 SNPs; the haplotype
of another Inuit individual differed by only 1 SNP, leaving a 4.5-Mb
region of shared haplotype among the Inuit individuals. Each of 2
Hispanic individuals had a unique haplotype; the extent of the
homozygous region was different in each individual.

After numerous unsuccessful attempts to identify the gene mutated in
FA-J (FANCJ), using a complementation cloning strategy, Levitus et al.
(2005) attempted positional cloning. By means of a genomewide scan using
closely positioned polymorphic markers, they identified the largest
region of homozygosity on chromosome 17 and studied this region in more
detail in informative families with FA-J. They also tested chromosome 17
for complementation of the Fanconi anemia defect by microcell-mediated
chromosome transfer. Boundaries of the chromosome 17 fragment and
information from the genomewide screen in genetically informative
families narrowed the FANCJ candidate region. They found that BRIP1
resided in the critical linkage region and considered it a good
candidate because chicken DT40 cells lacking BRIP1 expression have a
Fanconi anemia-like phenotype. They sequenced this gene in families with
FA-J and identified mutation in all affected individuals that segregated
with disease status in informative families. They found a recurrent
nonsense mutation, R798X in exon 17 (605882.0003), in 5 alleles from 4
individuals of diverse geographic origin, suggesting that it might be a
hotspot or an ancient mutation. All other mutations were private.

ovarian cancer and variation in the BRIP1 gene, see 167000.

Cantor et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous C-to-G transversion at
nucleotide 139 of the BRIP1 gene, resulting in a pro47-to-ala mutation,
in an individual with early-onset breast cancer (114480) and a family
history of breast and ovarian cancer. This mutation occurred in the
helicase domain of the BRIP1 protein and was not found in 200 controls.

history of breast and ovarian cancer. This mutation occurred in the
helicase domain of the BRIP1 protein and was not found in 200 controls.

FANCONI ANEMIA, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP J
BRIP1, ARG798TER

In 10 unrelated individuals with Fanconi anemia complementation group J
(609054), Levran et al. (2005) found either homozygosity or compound
heterozygosity for the nonsense mutation arg798 to ter (R798X) in the
BRIP1 gene. Three of the 10 individuals were compound heterozygotes. The
diverse ethnicity included Hispanic, European American, Irish Traveler,
and Inuit. Phenotypic and hematologic abnormalities in these 10 affected
families included growth retardation, cafe-au-lait spots,
microphthalmia, thumb and kidney abnormalities, hearing loss, and bone
marrow failure beginning between 2 and 6.5 years.

Levitus et al. (2005) found the R798X mutation in 5 alleles from 4
individuals with Fanconi anemia complementation group J of diverse
geographic origin: Canada, United Kingdom, Kuwait, and the United
States.

.0004
FANCONI ANEMIA, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP J
BRIP1, ALA349PRO

In a stillborn fetus with a gestational age of 22 weeks and Fanconi
anemia complementation group J (609054), Levran et al. (2005) identified
compound heterozygosity for mutations in the BRIP1 gene. The maternally
inherited mutation was arg798 to ter (R798X; 605882.0003). The
paternally inherited mutation was a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide
1186 in exon 8 of the BRIP1 gene, resulting in an ala349-to-pro (A349P)
substitution. The fetus exhibited intrauterine growth retardation,
radial and ulna aplasia, bilateral clubfeet, cleft palate, abnormal
facies, and severe gastrointestinal, urogenital, cardiovascular,
respiratory, and central nervous system abnormalities.

Wu et al. (2010) stated that BRIP1 ala349 resides immediately adjacent
to a highly conserved cysteine of the predicted iron-sulfur (Fe-S)
domain. They found that the recombinant wildtype BRIP1 protein possessed
3 Fe atoms per polypeptide, whereas BRIP1 A349P had only 1 Fe atom per
polypeptide. BRIP1 A349P did not differ from wildtype recombinant BRIP1
in binding to various DNA substrates, ATPase activity, or ability to
translocate along single-stranded DNA in an ATPase-dependent manner.
However, unlike wildtype BRIP1, BRIP1 A349P lacked the ability to unwind
forked duplex DNA, 3-stranded D-loop DNA, or G4 DNA, was not activated
by RPA (see 179835), and was unable to displace RAD51 (179617) from
single-stranded DNA. BRIP1 A349P failed to render cells resistant to the
effects of the DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C or the G4 DNA-binding
agent telomestatin. Wu et al. (2010) concluded that BRIP1 A349P exerts a
dominant-negative effect on cell survival or DNA damage accumulation
after treatment with agents that induce DNA damage or cellular stress.
They hypothesized that the mutation may disrupt the accumulation or
activity of other DNA repair/checkpoint factors at stalled replication
forks.

602139	TITLE *602139 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX, 7; NDUFA7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

See NDUFA2 (602137). By a combination of EST database searching and PCR,
Loeffen et al. (1998) isolated human cDNAs encoding NDUFA7 and 7 other
complex I subunits. The predicted 113-amino acid human protein is 89%
identical to B14.5A, the bovine homolog. Hydropathy analysis revealed
that NDUFA7 and 4 other subunits have an overall hydrophilic pattern,
even though they are found within the hydrophobic protein (HP) fraction
of complex I. See NDUFA10 (603835).

MAPPING

By intron-based radiation hybrid mapping, Emahazion and Brookes (1998)
assigned the NDUFA7 gene to 19p13.2. Although Dunbar et al. (1997) had
mapped the NDUFA7 gene to 20p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH), Emahazion and Brookes (1998) stated that subsequent mapping
studies with subfragments of the FISH-mapped recombinants of Dunbar et
al. (1997) suggested chimerism and confirmed that the earlier FISH data
were flawed.

605958	TITLE *605958 TRAF-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TRAIP
;;TRIP;;
RING FINGER PROTEIN 206; RNF206
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1; 191190) and CD95/FAS (134637)
interact via their death domains with signal-transducing partners such
as FADD (602457), TRADD (603500), and members of the TNFR-associated
factor (TRAF) family (e.g., TRAF2; 601895). TRAFs in turn interact with
downstream signal transducers, such as TRIP, leading to apoptosis via
activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) (Lee et al.,
1997).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse thymocyte cDNA library with
TRAF1 (601711) or TRAF2 as bait, followed by screening human and mouse
thymocyte cDNA libraries and a mouse T-cell cDNA library, Lee et al.
(1997) isolated full-length cDNAs encoding human and mouse TRIP
(TRAF-interacting protein). Sequence analysis predicted that the
469-amino acid human protein, which is 76% identical to the mouse
protein, has an N-terminal RING finger motif and a putative coiled-coil
domain. Northern blot analysis revealed highest expression of a 2.1-kb
transcript in mouse testis, thymus, and spleen. Expression of Trip was
reduced in activated lymphocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Binding analysis by Lee et al. (1997) indicated that the N-terminal
coiled-coil region of TRIP interacts with the N-terminal TRAF domain of
TRAF1 or TRAF2 and with TNFR2 (191191) or CD30 (153243) when coexpressed
with TRAF. Overexpression of TRIP inhibited NFKB activation induced by
TNF (191160), but not NFKB activation induced by interleukin-1 (see
147760).

By yeast 2-hybrid screening with CYLD (605018) as bait, followed by Far
Western blot and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Regamey et al. (2003)
found that the C terminus of TRIP interacted with the central domain of
CYLD. CYLD downregulated TNF-induced NFKB activation, and this
downregulation was dependent on CYLD-TRIP interaction and the
deubiquitinating activity of CYLD.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRIP
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP WI-13434).

602378	TITLE *602378 DYNAMIN 2; DNM2
;;DYN2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dynamins (DNMs) are members of a group of GTPases that share high
homology in their N-terminal regions. Mammals have at least 3 DNMs: DNM1
(602377), DNM2, and DNM3 (611445). Diatloff-Zito et al. (1995) had
previously isolated a human genomic DNA fragment by its capacity to
correct the mitomycin C hypersensitivity of cells from a Fanconi anemia
patient belonging to genetic complementation group D (FACD; 227646).
Using this fragment, they screened a human fibroblast cDNA library and
isolated a cDNA encoding DNM2. The predicted 866-amino acid protein is
73% and 98% identical to DNM1 and rat Dnm2, respectively. It contains
the 3 consensus sequence elements characteristic of GTP-binding proteins
at its N terminus, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a basic,
proline-rich C-terminal region that contains multiple SRC homology 3
domains. DNM2 contains 9 consensus motifs for CDC2 (116940)
phosphorylation, indicating a potential role at the G2/mitosis
transition. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.6-kb transcript in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle.
Sequencing and RT-PCR identified alternative splicing variants of DNM2.
The authors suggested that multiple rounds of duplication and divergence
occurred within DNM gene evolution. No alterations in DNM2 sequence or
mRNA expression were detected in the FACD patient studied.

By in situ hybridization with a Dnm2 mRNA probe, Koutsopoulos et al.
(2013) found Dnm2 expression in most mouse embryonic tissues, including
the peripheral nervous system, but not in skeletal muscle or heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Gomez et al. (2005) found that DYN2 accumulated at the T cell-antigen
presenting cell (APC) interface in the presence of antigen. DYN2
knockdown experiments showed that DYN2 coupled T-cell receptor
(TCR)-mediated signaling pathways to those regulating IL2 (147680)
promoter activity and CD69 (107273) expression. Further experiments
identified DYN2 as a critical regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in
response to TCR engagement. The proline-rich domain of DYN2 interacted
directly with the SH3 domain of VAV1 (164875), and this interaction was
required for T-cell activation. Gomez et al. (2005) concluded that DYN2
regulates actin reorganization at the immunologic synapse and links to
VAV1 and its downstream signaling pathways after TCR engagement.

Orth and McNiven (2003) found that Dyn2 associated with amphiphysin
(600418) on phagosomes in cultured cells. Expression of a
GTPase-deficient Dyn2 mutant prevented vesiculation and induced the
formation of long plasma membrane invaginations coated with the mutant
protein and terminated with a clathrin (see 118955) tip or bulb.

In studies in cultured mouse podocytes and rodent models of proteinuria,
Sever et al. (2007) showed that during proteinuric kidney disease,
induction of cytoplasmic cathepsin L (CTSL; 116880) led to cleavage of
dynamin at a conserved site between amino acids 354 and 359, resulting
in reorganization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton and proteinuria.
Dynamin mutants that lacked the CTSL site, or rendered the CTSL site
inaccessible through dynamin self-assembly, were resistant to CTSL
cleavage. When delivered into mice, these mutants restored podocyte
function and resolved proteinuria. Sever et al. (2007) concluded that
dynamin is a critical regulator of renal permselectivity that is
specifically targeted by proteolysis under pathologic conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zuchner et al. (2005) determined that the DNM2 gene contains 22 exons,
20 of which are coding.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, Klocke et al. (1997) found that the
mouse Dnm2 gene is closely linked to the Icam1 gene (147840) on the
proximal portion of chromosome 9, in a region with homologies to human
19p, 8q, and 11q. That the human ICAM1 gene is located on 19p13.3-p13.2
is evidence that the DNM2 gene is also in that region. The finding of
mutations in the DNM2 gene in families with a form of dominant
intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (606482) that maps to
19p13.2-p12 is further confirmation of the mapping of DNM2 to chromosome
19.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Because the DNM2 gene maps to 19p13.2-p12 and shares domains similar to
those of genes known to be involved in axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease (see 118210), Zuchner et al. (2005) considered it a candidate
gene for the form of dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
that maps to chromosome 19p13.2-p12 (DI-CMTB; 606482). They identified 3
unique mutations in the DNM2 pleckstrin homology domain in 3 unrelated
families with DI-CMTB. These mutations disturbed the function of DNM2 in
a cellular model. DNM2 represented the third protein mutated in CMT that
contains a GTPase domain and is related to fusion or fission of cellular
membranes. In 2 of the families neutropenia cosegregated with the
neuropathy; these families each had a mutation affecting lys558
(602378.0002, 602378.0003), which suggested that this residue has a
function in maturation or survival of peripheral blood cells.

Bitoun et al. (2005) carried out genomewide linkage mapping analysis in
2 families with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (CNM1;
160150), narrowing the CNM1 locus to an 11-Mb interval on 19p13.2. The
DNM2 gene, which maps to this region, was considered a good candidate.
Sequencing of exons and intron-exon boundaries in the probands of 3
families identified heterozygous mutations. Two were located in exon 8
and involved the same arg369 residue, (R369Q, 602378.0004; R369W,
602378.0005), and 1 was in exon 11 and involved an R465W mutation
(602378.0006). Another mutation, E368K (602378.0007), was a de novo
mutation in 1 family.

Tosch et al. (2006) described a patient with centronuclear myopathy who
carried heterozygous mutations in both the DNM2 (E368K; 602378.0007) and
MTMR14 (Y462C; 611089.0002) genes. They noted that whereas centronuclear
myopathy patients with other characterized mutations in DYN2 usually
have an age of onset in childhood or adulthood, the age of onset in
their patient was neonatal. The report raised the possibility of MTMR14
being a modifier of the phenotype in some cases of centronuclear
myopathy.

Bitoun et al. (2007) identified 4 different de novo heterozygous DNM2
mutations (see, e.g., 602378.0010; 602378.0011) in 5 unrelated patients
with sporadic CNM. All mutations were in exon 16 of the DNM2 gene within
the pleckstrin homology domain. Three of the patients had a severe
disorder with onset at birth.

Using in vitro sedimentation assays, Wang et al. (2010) showed that
centronuclear myopathy-associated mutant DNM2 proteins (see, e.g.,
602378.0005-602378.0007) formed more stable dynamin polymers in the
presence of GTP compared to wildtype, presumably reflecting abnormally
strong dynamin-dynamin interactions. The mutant protein aggregates were
less sensitive to disassociation by GTP, and retained higher GTPase
activities compared to wildtype. The observations suggested that the
affected residues, such as glu368, arg369, and arg465, normally function
to prevent excessive or prolonged dynamin assembly.

- Lethal Congenital Contracture Syndrome 5

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, with lethal
congenital contracture syndrome-5 (LCCS5; 615368), Koutsopoulos et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous missense mutation in the DNM2 gene
(F379V; 602378.0013). The infants all showed severe hypotonia with lack
of spontaneous movement and respiratory insufficiency at birth,
resulting in death in a few days to months. Each also showed retinal
hemorrhages. Studies on patient cells and in vitro functional analysis
indicated that the mutation was hypomorphic. Animal studies in mice and
zebrafish suggested a role for Dnm2 in the development of muscle fibers
and vasculature.

ANIMAL MODEL

Koutsopoulos et al. (2013) found that morpholino knockdown of Dnm2 in
zebrafish embryos resulted in lethality in 10% and bent tails in 20%.
Morphant muscle fibers showed mild misalignment of muscle fibers;
muscular innervation appeared normal. There were also defects in the
endothelium of the vascular system. The findings suggested that Dnm2 has
a pleiotropic role during development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE B
DNM2, 9-BP DEL, NT1652

In a North American family with dominant intermediate
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (606482), Zuchner et al. (2005) found a 9-bp
deletion of the 3-prime end of exon 14 of the DNM2 gene
(1652_1659+1delATGAGGAGg). The mutation was predicted to result in 2
alternative mRNA products, one with a premature stop codon resulting
from a shift of the open reading frame (D550fs) and the other an
in-frame mRNA with a predicted deletion of 3 amino acids (D551_E553del)
produced by disruption of the original 3-prime splice site and use of a
newly introduced splice site with higher predicted splicing activity.

.0002
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE B, WITH NEUTROPENIA
DNM2, LYS558GLU

In an Australian family with dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease (606482), Zuchner et al. (2005) found that affected individuals
carried a mutation in exon 15 of the DNM2 gene, 1672A-G, resulting in
the amino acid substitution lys558-to-glu (K558E). Subclinically low
counts of neutrophils and, in some affected individuals, few
lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets cosegregated with CMT.

.0003
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, DOMINANT INTERMEDIATE B, WITH NEUTROPENIA
DNM2, LYS558 DEL

In a Belgian family with dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease and associated neutropenia (606482), Zuchner et al. (2005)
identified a deletion of nucleotides 1672 through 1674 (1672_1674delAAG)
in the DNM2 gene, resulting in deletion of a single amino acid, lys558.
That an abnormality of lys558 was found in 2 families (see also
602378.0002) in which neutropenia, not a general feature of dominant
intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, cosegregated with the
neuropathy implied that this residue has a function in maturation or
survival of peripheral blood cells. Congenital neutropenia (202700) is
caused by mutations in the gene elastase-2 gene (ELA2; 130130), which
maps to 19p13.3. In the Belgian family, Zuchner et al. (2005) excluded
mutations in ELA2 as the cause of neutropenia by sequence analysis of
all coding exons.

In a follow-up of the Belgian family reported by Zuchner et al. (2005),
Claeys et al. (2009) found that 1 mutation carrier had neutropenia and
cataracts without signs of a neuropathy. In addition, 5 members of this
family had early-onset cataracts in their teenage years.

.0004
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, 1
DNM2, ARG369GLN

In a family from French Guyana, Bitoun et al. (2005) found that 14
members with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (160150) carried
an 1106G-A mutation in exon 8 of the DNM2 gene, resulting in the amino
acid substitution arg369-to-gln (R369Q).

.0005
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, 1
DNM2, ARG369TRP

In a French family with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy
(160150), Bitoun et al. (2005) found an 1105C-to-T transition in exon 8
of the DNM2 gene that resulted in an arg369-to-trp (R369W) amino acid
substitution.

.0006
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, 1
DNM2, ARG465TRP

In a French family with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy
(160150), Bitoun et al. (2005) found an arg465-to-trp (R465W) mutation,
caused by 1393C-T transition in exon 11 of the DNM2 gene. This mutation
was found in 5 additional families, 2 Belgian, 1 German, 1 from Great
Britain, and 1 from the United States.

.0007
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, 1
DNM2, GLU368LYS

In a French proband with centronuclear myopathy (160150), Bitoun et al.
(2005) found an 1102G-to-A transition in exon 8 of the DNM2 gene that
resulted in a glu368-to-lys amino acid substitution (E368K). The
mutation occurred de novo.

Tosch et al. (2006) reported this mutation in heterozygosity in a
36-year-old woman with centronuclear myopathy who presented with
neonatal hypotonia, muscle weakness, and ophthalmoparesis. She also
carried a heterozygous missense mutation in the myotubularin-related
protein-14 gene (MTMR14; 611089.0002). Both mutations occurred de novo.
The report raised the possibility of MTMR14 being a modifier of the
phenotype in some cases of centronuclear myopathy.

.0008
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2M
DNM2, GLY533CYS

In affected members of a family with autosomal dominant CMT2M (see
606482), Fabrizi et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 1597G-T
transversion in the DNM2 gene, resulting in a gly533-to-cys (G533C)
substitution. The phenotype was milder than that reported for other CMT
patients with DNM2 mutations and was more consistent with an axonal form
of CMT.

.0009
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2M
DNM2, LEU566HIS

In a 45-year-old proband of a family with autosomal dominant CMT2M (see
606482), Fabrizi et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 1697T-A
transversion in the DNM2 gene, resulting in a leu566-to-his (L566H)
substitution. The phenotype was milder than that reported for other CMT
patients with DNM2 mutations and was more consistent with an axonal form
of CMT.

.0010
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, 1
DNM2, SER619LEU

In 2 unrelated patients with sporadic centronuclear myopathy (160150),
Bitoun et al. (2007) identified a de novo heterozygous 1856C-T
transition in exon 16 of the DNM2 gene, resulting in a ser619-to-leu
(S619L) substitution within the pleckstrin homology domain. Both
patients had a severe phenotype, with onset at birth necessitating
ventilation and nasogastric feeding, and delayed motor development.
Another unrelated patient with a milder phenotype had a different
heterozygous mutation in the same codon (S619W; 602378.0011).

.0011
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, 1
DNM2, SER619TRP

In a patient with sporadic centronuclear myopathy (160150), Bitoun et
al. (2007) identified a de novo heterozygous 1856C-G transversion in
exon 16 of the DNM2 gene, resulting in a ser619-to-trp (S619W)
substitution. Two other unrelated patients with a more severe phenotype
had a different heterozygous mutation in the same codon (S619L;
602378.0010).

.0012
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2M
DNM2, GLY358ARG

In a mother and her 2 adult daughters with autosomal dominant CMT2M (see
606482), Gallardo et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 1072G-A
transition in exon 7 of the DNM2 gene, resulting in a gly358-to-arg
(G358R) substitution in a highly conserved region in the middle domain.
The patients were ages 55, 32, and 23, and motor nerve conduction
velocities were 33, 46, and 50 m/s, respectively. All had progressive
gait unsteadiness and foot deformities, including pes cavus and toe
clawing, in the first decade of life. All had distal muscle weakness and
atrophy of the lower limbs, and the mother also had hand weakness and
atrophy. Ankle reflexes were absent in all 3, and all had hypoesthesia
of the lower limbs. MRI studies showed fatty infiltration of the calf
muscles, particularly in the anterior compartment. The fatty
infiltration increased distally and was massive in the foot musculature.
Muscle edema was also present in affected muscles. In a follow-up of the
family reported by Gallardo et al. (2008), Claeys et al. (2009) stated
that the phenotype was consistent with axonal CMT2.

.0013
LETHAL CONGENITAL CONTRACTURE SYNDROME 5 (1 family)
DNM2, PHE379VAL

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, with lethal
congenital contracture syndrome-5 (LCCS5; 615368), Koutsopoulos et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous c.1135T-G transversion in exon 9 of the
DNM2 gene, resulting in a phe379-to-val (F379V) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the middle domain of the protein. The mutation,
which was found by homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene
sequencing, was not present in 100 Pakistani controls and was absent
from SNP databases. Patient fibroblasts showed a 20% reduction in
DNM2-dependent endocytosis, and recombinant F379V DNM2 showed a 20%
reduction in GTPase activity, consistent with its being a hypomorphic
allele. The patients showed decreased fetal movements and severe
hypotonia with respiratory insufficiency at birth. They had areflexia,
lack of spontaneous movement, joint contractures, and thin ribs and
bones. In addition, all had retinal hemorrhages and 2 had evidence of
intracranial bleeding (subdural hematoma and blood in the subarachnoid
cavity). Muscle biopsy of 1 patient showed small rounded fibers with
some centralized nuclei, suggestive of a congenital myopathy component,
whereas muscle biopsy of another patient showed showed atrophic fibers
without obvious centralization of nuclei. EMG studies of 1 patient
suggested a myopathy or lower motor neuron disease, whereas in the other
2 patients, EMG revealed low nerve conduction velocities, suggesting a
hypomyelinating neuropathy or anterior horn disease. Death occurred at
ages 5 days, 19 days, and 4 months. Both parents showed decreased
reflexes on examination, and skeletal muscle biopsy of the mother showed
fiber size variation and centralized nuclei, suggestive of a mild form
of centronuclear myopathy.

610291	TITLE *610291 SYNAPTIC VESICLE GLYCOPROTEIN 2C; SV2C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for novel members of the synaptic vesicle
glycoprotein 2 (SV2) family followed by screening a rat brain cDNA
library, Janz and Sudhof (1999) identified a clone that they designated
SV2C. The SV2C protein shares 62% identity with SV2A (185860) and 57%
identity with SV2B (185861), and contains 12 transmembrane regions and a
protein kinase C phosphorylation site between transmembrane domains 6
and 7 in common with these proteins. Two negatively charged amino acids
in the first transmembrane domain constitute another conserved motif,
indicating that SV2C could transport positively charged substrates like
chloride or ATP. To characterize SV2C and compare its properties and
localization with those of SV2A and SV2B, Janz and Sudhof (1999) raised
an SV2C-specific antibody. Using this antibody, they showed that SV2C is
an N-glycosylated protein that is concentrated on small synaptic
vesicles; in addition, it is found on microvesicles in adrenal
chromaffin cells.

The human SV2C gene encodes a protein of 727 amino acids (GenBank
GENBANK NP_055794).

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunoblot analysis in subcellular sections from rat brain, Janz
and Sudhof (1999) evaluated the relative localization of SV2A, SV2B, and
SV2C. Analysis of the resulting staining patterns confirmed previous
conclusions that SV2A is ubiquitously expressed in virtually all
synapses. SV2B, although more restricted in distribution, was also found
in a wide variety of synapses throughout the brain. In striking contrast
to this general localization and to similarly wide distributions of
other synaptic vesicle proteins, SV2C was observed in only a few brain
areas. High levels of SV2C were found primarily in phylogenetically old
brain regions such as the pallidum, the substantia nigra, the midbrain,
the brainstem, and the olfactory bulb. SV2C was undetectable in the
cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, and found at low levels in the
cerebellar cortex.

Iezzi et al. (2005) characterized SV2A, SV2B, and SV2C and defined their
involvement in regulated insulin secretion. They observed that SV2A and
SV2C are associated with insulin-containing granules and synaptic-like
microvesicles in INS-1E insulinoma and primary beta cells, whereas SV2B
is only present on synaptic-like microvesicles. Neither overexpression
nor isoform-specific silencing of SV2A or SV2C by RNA interference
modified depolarization-triggered cytosolic calcium ion rises or
secretory granule calcium ion concentrations. Iezzi et al. (2005)
suggested that these data strongly argue against any calcium ion
transport function of SV2. Moreover, up- or downregulation of these
isoforms had no influence on potassium ion-induced insulin release,
suggesting that SV2 does not affect the calcium ion-dependent step(s) of
exocytosis. By contrast, Iezzi et al. (2005) found that glucose-elicited
secretion was inhibited during the sustained rather than the early
phase, placing the action of SV2 on the recruitment of granules from the
reserve pool to the plasma membrane. This conclusion was reinforced by
capacitance measurements in glucose-stimulated SV2C-deficient cells.
Like capacitance, evoked and basal hormone release were attenuated more
by silencing of SV2C compared with SV2A. Iezzi et al. (2005) concluded
that their data indicate only partial redundancy and highlight a key
role for SV2C in the secretory process.

Dong et al. (2006) found that botulinum neurotoxin A enters neurons by
binding to the synaptic vesicle protein SV2. Fragments of SV2 that
harbored the toxin interaction domain inhibited botulinum neurotoxin A
from binding to neurons. Botulinum neurotoxin A binding to SV2A and SV2B
knockout hippocampal neurons was abolished and was restored by
expressing SV2A, SV2B, or SV2C. Reduction of SV2 expression in rat
neuronal cell lines also inhibited entry of botulinum neurotoxin A,
which could be restored by expressing SV2 isoforms. Finally, mice that
lacked SV2B displayed reduced sensitivity to botulinum neurotoxin A.
Thus, Dong et al. (2006) concluded that SV2 acts as the protein receptor
for botulinum neurotoxin A.

Mahrhold et al. (2006) found that botulinum neurotoxin A interacts with
the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein SV2C but not with the homologous
proteins SV2A and SV2B. Binding of botulinum neurotoxin A occurs at the
membrane juxtaposed region preceding transmembrane domain 8. A peptide
comprising the intravesicular domain between transmembrane domains 7 and
8 specifically reduces the neurotoxicity of botulinum neurotoxin A at
phrenic nerve preparations, demonstrating the physiologic relevance of
this interaction.

LEU M5, ALPHA SUBUNIT;;
MYELOID MEMBRANE ANTIGEN, ALPHA SUBUNIT;;
CD11C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Leukocyte surface antigen p150,95 shares a beta subunit (600065) with 2
other members of the leukocyte adhesion molecule family (120980, 153370)
but has a unique alpha chain. Corbi et al. (1987) cloned and sequenced
the gene for the alpha subunit of p150,95. The 4.7-kb cDNA clone encodes
a signal sequence, an extracellular domain of 1,081 amino acids
containing 10 potential glycosylation sites, a transmembrane domain of
26 amino acids, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 29 residues. It
shows homology to the alpha subunits of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
(607759), vitronectin receptor (193210), and fibronectin (135620)
receptor. The receptors involved in both cell-cell and cell-matrix
interactions appear to belong to a single superfamily of genes termed
the integrins.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Corbi et al. (1988) demonstrated that the
genes encoding the alpha subunits of LFA-1, Mac1, and p150,95, all of
which play a part in leukocyte adhesion, constitute a cluster located on
16p13.1-p11. Callen et al. (1991) narrowed the assignment of the alpha-X
integrin (ITGAX) gene to 16p11.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

gene and systemic lupus erythematosus, see SLEB6 (609939).

604470	TITLE *604470 CD2 ANTIGEN-BINDING PROTEIN 2; CD2BP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human CD2 (186990) facilitates both adhesion and activation of T
lymphocytes on binding to its ligand CD58 (LFA3; 153420). This binding
augments interleukin-12 (IL12; see 161560)-driven T-cell responsiveness.
By use of interaction trap cloning with the yeast 2-hybrid system and
5-prime RACE PCR, Nishizawa et al. (1998) identified a T-cell line cDNA
encoding a 341-amino acid protein, termed CD2BP2, that interacts with
the cytoplasmic tail of CD2. The authors noted that a segment near the C
terminus contains a consensus site for tyrosine phosphorylation. RNA
blot analysis indicated that CD2BP2 is expressed in a wide variety of
organs as approximately 1.35- and 4-kb transcripts. Immunoprecipitation
experiments showed that CD2BP2 expressed in J77 Jurkat and COS-7 cells
associates specifically with CD2. Mutation analysis suggested that a
21-amino acid motif is critical for CD2 binding and that 2 PPPGHR
sequences within the CD2 cytoplasmic tail mediate the binding to CD2BP2.
Additional transfection studies showed that CD2BP2 expression
selectively enhances IL2 (147680) production on crosslinking of CD2.

610578	TITLE *610578 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 15; ARHGAP15
;;BM046
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RHO GTPases (see ARHA; 165390) regulate diverse biologic processes, and
their activity is regulated by RHO GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs),
such as ARHGAP15 (Seoh et al., 2003).

CLONING

By database analysis, followed by PCR of an available EST, Seoh et al.
(2003) cloned the coding region of ARHGAP15. The deduced 475-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a
C-terminal GAP domain, which is highly similar to the GAP domains of
ARHGAP9 (610576) and ARHGAP12 (610577). Northern blot analysis detected
a 1.7-kb transcript in spleen, lung, liver, and a myeloid leukemia cell
line. A 1.4-kb transcript was detected in skeletal muscle, and a 3-kb
transcript was detected in thymus.

GENE FUNCTION

Seoh et al. (2003) found that the GAP domain of ARHGAP15 showed
specificity toward RAC1 (602048) in vitro. The PH domain was required
for ARHGAP15 to localize to the cell periphery. In COS-7 and HeLa cells,
overexpression of the full-length protein but not of the PH
domain-truncated mutant resulted in an increase in actin stress fibers
and cell contraction. These morphologic effects were attenuated by
coexpression of a dominant-negative RAC1 mutant. HeLa cells expressing
ARHGAP15 were also resistant to phorbol ester treatment, suggesting that
ARHGAP15 is a regulator of RAC1.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
ARHGAP15 gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP SHGC-64284).

609079	TITLE *609079 F-BOX AND LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT PROTEIN 12; FBXL12
;;FBL12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXL12, are characterized
by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Winston et al. (1999) cloned mouse Fbl12. The deduced protein contains
an N-terminal F box, followed by 7 tandem leucine-rich repeats.

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the human FBXL12 protein contains an
N-terminal F box, followed by 7 leucine-rich repeats.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXL12 gene maps to chromosome 19p13.2
and the mouse Fbxl12 gene maps to chromosome 9A3.

610715	TITLE *610715 HEMOGEN; HEMGN
;;ERYTHROID DIFFERENTIATION-ASSOCIATED GENE; EDAG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Yang et al. (2001) cloned mouse Hemgn and, by database analysis and
RT-PCR of a K562 myelogenous leukemia cell line cDNA library, they
cloned human HEMGN, or EDAG. The deduced mouse and human proteins
contain 503 and 484 amino acids, respectively, and share 43% identity. A
coiled-coil region and bipartite nuclear localization signal are
conserved in the N termini of both proteins. Northern blot analysis
detected a major 2.4-kb transcript and a minor 1.8-kb transcript in
adult human bone marrow and fetal liver. RT-PCR detected high HEMGN
expression in untreated and mitogen-treated K562 cells, adult bone
marrow, and CD34 (142230)-positive progenitor cells. Lower expression
was detected in a child thymus and in a histiocyte lymphoma cell line,
but no expression was detected in cultured T cells, monocytes, and
nonhematopoietic cell lines examined. Northern blot analysis of adult
mice detected Hemgn expression in bone marrow and spleen, but not in
thymus and nonhematopoietic tissues. In situ hybridization of adult
spleen revealed Hemgn in red, but not white, pulp. In situ hybridization
of day-8.5 mouse embryos showed Hemgn in blood islands of the yolk sac
and in circulating primitive blood cells. Hemgn was expressed in
developing hepatic primordia at day 10.5 and, from day 11.5, it was
expressed exclusively in fetal liver. FACS analysis showed Hemgn in
hematopoietic precursors of adult mice, but not in mature blood cells.
Transfected COS-7 cells expressed mouse Hemgn in nuclei, but not in
nucleoli or cytoplasm.

By database analysis, Yang et al. (2003) identified a testis-specific
HEMGN splice variant that they called HEMGN-t. HEMGN-t and the
hematopoietic variant, HEMGN-h, differ in their 5-prime and 3-prime
UTRs, but they have the same coding region. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.9-kb HEMGN-t transcript in mouse and human testis. In situ
hybridization of adult mouse testis revealed Hemgn only in round
spermatids. Northern blot analysis showed that Hemgn expression in
prepubertal mouse testis correlated with the appearance of postmeiotic
cells, and Hemgn expression was weak in testis of mice lacking
postmeiotic germ cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2004) found that downregulation of EDAG in K562 cells
resulted in inhibition of growth and colony formation, as well as
enhancement of sensitivity to erythroid differentiation induced by
hemin. Overexpression of EDAG in a human myeloid leukemia cell line
significantly blocked expression of the monocyte/macrophage
differentiation marker CD11b (ITGAM; 120980) after mitogen exposure.
Moreover, overexpression of EDAG in a mouse pro-B cell line prolonged
survival and increased expression of Myc (190080), Bcl2 (151430), and
Bclxl (600039) in the absence of interleukin-3 (IL3; 147740). EDAG
enhanced the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011),
and high DNA-binding activity of Nfkb was sustained in EDAG-expressing
pre-B cells after IL3 withdrawal. In these cells, inhibition of Nfkb
activity promoted cell death. Li et al. (2004) concluded that EDAG
regulates proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and
resists cell death through activation of NFKB.

By examining expression of a mouse Hemgn promoter-reporter plasmid in
transgenic mice, Yang et al. (2006) showed that the promoter was
transcriptionally active in embryonic yolk sac, fetal liver, and adult
spleen, bone marrow, brain, thymus, lung, and testis. Mutagenesis
analysis showed that 2 highly conserved GATA boxes were critical for
promoter activity. GATA1 (305371), but not GATA2 (137295), bound to the
GATA-binding sites and transactivated the Hemgn promoter in a
dose-dependent manner. Yang et al. (2006) also found that levels of
HEMGN and GATA1 transcripts closely correlated in human primary acute
myeloid leukemia specimens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yang et al. (2001) determined that the HEMGN gene spans 18 kb and
contains 5 exons. The first exon is specific to the HEMGN-t variant and
encodes an alternative 5-prime UTR. The donor-acceptor sequence used for
this alternative first exon is GC-AC instead of the canonical GT-AG. The
last exon of HEMGN contains 2 alternative noncanonical polyadenylation
sequences used by the HEMGN-t and HEMGN-h variants. Two promoters in the
5-prime region direct transcription of HEMGN-t and HEMGN-h and are
separated by 6 kb.

Yang et al. (2006) found that the region upstream of the HEMGN coding
sequence contains several evolutionarily conserved sequences and that
the proximal promoter contains a TATA box and 2 conserved GATA boxes.

;;GLXR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cramer et al. (1999) and Rumsby and Cregeen (1999) independently
identified a glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR; EC
1.1.1.79) cDNA clone from a human liver EST library. The GRHPR gene
encodes a predicted 328-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 35.5 kD. By transient transfection of the cDNA clone into COS
cells, Cramer et al. (1999) verified that GRHPR encodes an enzyme with
hydroxypyruvate reductase, glyoxylate reductase, and D-glycerate
dehydrogenase enzymatic activities. Database analysis of human ESTs
revealed widespread tissue expression, indicating that the enzyme may
have a role in metabolism.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cramer et al. (1999) determined that the GRHPR gene contains 9 exons
spanning approximately 9 kb.

MAPPING

Using ESTs, Cramer et al. (1999) found that the GRHPR gene maps
pericentromeric on chromosome 9. Webster et al. (2000) presented
haplotype data indicating that the GRHPR gene is located near the marker
D9S1874.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 pairs of sibs from 2 unrelated families with type II hyperoxaluria
(260000), Cramer et al. (1999) identified a 1-bp deletion in the GRHPR
gene (103delG; 604296.0001) by SSCP analysis. All 4 patients were
homozygous for the same mutation.

Webster et al. (2000) identified 5 other mutations in patients with type
II hyperoxaluria. Ten of 11 patients that they had genotyped were
homozygous for 1 of the 6 known mutations. In the case of two-thirds of
the patients, the parents were related. Genotyping also showed the
possible presence of a founder effect for the 2 most common mutations:
103delG and arg99 to ter (604296.0002).

first nucleotide (G) of codon 35 (103G) of the GRHPR gene, resulting in
a frameshift beginning at codon 35 and predicted to result in a
truncated protein of 44 amino acids. All 4 patients were homozygous for
this mutation.

In 4 of 18 alleles of the GRHPR gene in patients with type II primary

611562	TITLE *611562 SEPTIN 12; SEPT12
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Septins, such as SEPT12, are conserved GTP-binding proteins that
function as dynamic, regulatable scaffolds for the recruitment of other
proteins. They are involved in membrane dynamics, vesicle trafficking,
apoptosis, and cytoskeleton remodeling, as well as infection,
neurodegeneration, and neoplasia (Hall et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for members of the septin family, Hall et al.
(2005) identified SEPT12. DNA microarray analysis showed low expression
of SEPT12 in all normal, diseased, and cancer tissues examined.

Using microarray analysis to identify genes downregulated in testis of
men with spermatocyte maturation arrest (see 270960) or Sertoli
cell-only syndrome (see 400042), followed by database analysis, Lin et
al. (2006) identified SEPT12. The deduced protein contains 358 amino
acids. RT-PCR of 8 human tissues detected SEPT12 expression in testis
only. In mouse tissues, highest Sept12 expression was detected in testis
and ovary, with weaker expression in lung, kidney, and uterus. In mouse
testis, 2 Sept12 transcripts were detected at postnatal day 1 and
increased in abundance until adulthood.

Steels et al. (2007) stated that 2 SEPT12 transcripts that differ in the
presence or absence of exon 4 exist in humans and other mammals. Both
protein isoforms contain consensus GTP-binding motifs, a polybasic
domain, and a septin unique element, but they lack a C-terminal
coiled-coil sequence found in other septins. RT-PCR identified the
transcript containing exon 4 as the major Sept12 variant in rat testis,
and Western blot analysis confirmed this finding at the protein level.
Immunohistochemical analysis of adult rat sperm revealed localization of
Sept12 in a ring structure demarcating the end of the mitochondrial
sheath. During cytokinesis in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
cells, fluorescence-tagged rat Sept12 localized to the actomyosin
cleavage apparatus in the cleavage furrow.

By immunofluorescence analysis of human spermatozoa, Lin et al. (2011)
found that SEPT12 concentrated around the acrosome in the first step of
spermiogenesis. With the formation of mitochondria and mature
spermatozoa, SEPT12 localized at the neck and annulus region.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lin et al. (2006) determined that the SEPT12 gene contains at least 10
exons and spans about 16 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hall et al. (2005) mapped the SEPT12 gene
to chromosome 16p13.3.

Lin et al. (2006) reported that the mouse Sept12 gene maps to chromosome
16A1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Steels et al. (2007) found that the short
isoform of human SEPT12 and the long isoform of rat Sept12
self-associated. Both isoforms bound all rat and human septins tested
except rat Sept3 (608314) and human SEPT9 (604061), with which SEPT12
shares highest similarity, and human SEPT10, which exhibits nuclear
localization. The interactions depended upon the ability of septins to
coordinate guanine nucleotide. Both SEPT12 isoforms bound guanine
nucleotides in a GDP:GTP ratio of approximately 2:1, but like other
septins, neither SEPT12 isoform showed measurable GDP-GTP exchange
activity. Both isoforms also bound phosphoinositides, with preference
for monophosphorylated phosphoinositides, and phosphatidylserine. When
expressed in CHO cells, rat Sept12 formed short linear filaments and
cytoplasmic aggregates. However, upon coexpression, rat Sept12 and human
SEPT4 (603696) formed curved filaments.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lin et al. (2012) analyzed the SEPT12 gene in 160 infertile men (SPGF10;
614822) and 200 fertile controls and identified a variant (474G-A;
611562.0001) that was significantly more prevalent in infertile men than
controls. Nine of 15 men homozygous for the 474A allele had
teratozoospermia, and their sperm showed a bent tail and a decondensed
nucleus with significant DNA damage. Transfection studies showed that
mutant SEPT12 disrupted filament formation of wildtype SEPT in a
dose-dependent manner.

Kuo et al. (2012) analyzed the SEPT12 gene in 160 infertile men and
identified 2 heterozygous missense mutations, 1 in a man with
asthenoteratozoospermia and 1 in a man with oligoasthenozoospermia
(611562.0002, 611562.0003). Functional analysis demonstrated that both
mutations adversely affected filament formation of wildtype SEPT12 in a
dose-dependent manner. Characteristics of abnormal sperm included a
defective annulus with a bent tail and loss of SEPT12 from the annulus.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lin et al. (2011) found that Sept12 +/- male mice were sterile due to
severe spermatogenic defects, including immotility, bent tail, rounded
head, and acrosomal defects. Sept12 +/- sperm showed a reduced rate of
fertilization in vitro, and the resultant embryos failed to develop past
the morula stage.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPERMATOGENIC FAILURE 10, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
SEPT12, 474G-A

Lin et al. (2012) analyzed the SEPT12 gene in 160 infertile men (SPGF10;
614822) and 200 fertile controls and identified a 474G-A transition in
exon 5, within the GTP-binding domain, that was more prevalent in
infertile men than controls in both allele (p = 0.007) and genotype (p =
0.003) frequencies. Sequence analysis showed that the G-to-A transition
created a novel splice donor site that resulted in skipping of 41 bp in
the 3-prime portion of exon 5, causing a frameshift and a premature
termination codon in exon 6. Transfection studies in NT2D1 cells
overexpressing SEPT12 showed that wildtype SEPT12 formed filaments
surrounding the nuclear membrane whereas mutant SEPT12 aggregated to
form a dot-like structure that did not surround the nuclear periphery.
Similarly, immunofluorescence assay in spermatozoa from fertile men
demonstrated the presence of SEPT12 around the nuclear periphery of
round spermatids, at the neck region of elongating spermatids, and at
the neck region and annulus of mature spermatozoa, whereas in infertile
men with 474A/A, SEPT12 showed a dot-like pattern in different stages of
haploid germ cells. Mutant SEPT12 was also observed to disrupt the
filament formation of wildtype SEPT12 in a dose-dependent manner.
Examination of sperm from 474A/A infertile men by transmission electron
microscopy showed a loose nuclear matrix; narrow head and decondensed
nuclear matrix was observed under atomic force microscopy.

.0002
SPERMATOGENIC FAILURE 10, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
SEPT12, THR89MET

In a 36-year-old infertile male with spermatogenic failure (SPGF10;
614822), Kuo et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a 266C-T
transition in exon 3 of the SEPT12 gene, resulting in a thr89-to-met
(T89M) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the switch I motif
of the GTPase domain. The patient had asthenoteratozoospermia, with a
sperm count of 20.5 x 10(6)/ml, morphology that was 92% abnormal, and a
total motility of 48%. The mutation was not found in 200 fertile men
with normal semen parameters. Functional analysis demonstrated that the
T89M mutant had significantly reduced GTP hydrolytic activity and
restricted filament formation of wildtype SEPT12 in a dose-dependent
manner.

.0003
SPERMATOGENIC FAILURE 10, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
SEPT12, ASP197ASN

In a 33-year-old infertile male with spermatogenic failure (SPGF10;
614822), Kuo et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a 589G-A
transition in exon 6 of the SEPT12 gene, resulting in an asp197-to-asn
(D197N) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
guanine-recognition site of the GTPase domain. The patient had
oligoasthenozoospermia, with a sperm count of 0.9 x 10(6)/ml, morphology
that was 80% abnormal, and a total motility of 22%. The mutation was not
found in 200 fertile men with normal semen parameters. Functional
analysis demonstrated that D197N mutant interfered with GTP binding and
restricted filament formation of wildtype SEPT12 in a dose-dependent
manner. Immunofluorescence staining showed that about 56% of the
patient's abnormal sperm did not show a SEPT12 signal, compared to only
about 15% of abnormal-appearing sperm from fertile men. In the patient,
loss of annulus SEPT12 or SEPT4 (603696) signals were observed in sperm
with abnormal morphology, indicating that SEPT12 interacts with SEPT4 to
form a septin protein complex at the annulus. Some D197N sperm contained
a deformed tail with reduced diameter at the midpiece-principal piece
junction (annulus site).

;;TRANSDUCIN-BETA-LIKE 1; TBL1;;
EBI, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; EBI
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TBL1X is an intrinsic component of the nuclear corepressor (NCOR)
complex (see NCOR1; 600849). TBL1X also acts as a specific adaptor that
recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating (see 602961)/19S proteasome (see
154365) complex that mediates the exchange of corepressors for
coactivators (Perissi et al., 2008).

CLONING

In the course of constructing a deletion map of the distal portion of
the short arm of the X chromosome and the identification of GPR143
(300808), the gene mutant in OA1 (300500), Bassi et al. (1999) performed
cDNA selection experiments that resulted in the isolation of a novel
gene, TBL1, located outside the OA1 critical region on the telomeric
side. The TBL1 gene maps to the Xp22.3 region and shares significant
homology with members of the WD40 repeat-containing protein family. The
open reading frame encodes a 526-amino acid protein containing 6
beta-transducin repeats (WD40 motif) in the C-terminal domain. The
homology with known beta-subunits of G proteins and other WD40
repeat-containing proteins is restricted to the WD40 motif. Northern
blot analysis indicated that the TBL1 gene is ubiquitously expressed as
2 transcripts of approximately 2.1 and 6.0 kb.

Dong et al. (1999) reported that the Drosophila eb1 gene is conserved in
a number of species, including humans. Sequence analysis using the human
EB1 sequence reported by Dong et al. (1999) revealed identity with a
51-amino acid stretch in the N-terminal F box of TBL1 (Converse, 2001).

GENE FUNCTION

Matsuzawa and Reed (2001) elucidated a network of protein interactions
in which SIAH1 (602212), SIP (606186), SKP1 (601434), and EBI
collaborate in a pathway controlling beta-catenin (116806) levels,
affecting activity of beta-catenin-dependent TCF (e.g., TCF1; 142410)
and LEF (e.g., LEF1; 153245) transcription factors. This pathway is
inducible by p53 (191170), revealing a link between genotoxic injury
responses and beta-catenin degradation. SIAH1 is physically linked to
EBI by association with SIP, which binds SKP1.

Using database mining and protein structural prediction programs, Emes
and Ponting (2001) identified a sequence motif in the products of genes
mutated in Miller-Dieker lissencephaly (LIS1; 601545), Treacher Collins
(TCOF1, treacle; 606847), and oral-facial-digital type 1 (CXORF5;
300170) syndromes, as well as in TBL1, which is deleted in patients with
the contiguous syndrome ocular albinism with late onset sensorineural
deafness (OASD; 300650). Over 100 eukaryotic intracellular proteins were
found to possess a LIS1 homology motif, including several katanin p60
(606696) subunits, muskelin (605623), Nopp140 (602394), the plant
proteins tonneau and LEUNIG, slime mold protein aimless, and numerous WD
repeat-containing beta-propeller proteins. The authors suggested that
LIS1 homology motifs may contribute to the regulation of microtubule
dynamics, either by mediating dimerization, or else by binding
cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (600112) or microtubules directly. The
predicted secondary structure of LIS1 homology motifs, and their
occurrence in homologs of G-beta beta-propeller subunits, suggests that
they are analogs of G-gamma subunits, and might associate with the
periphery of beta-propeller domains. The finding of LIS1 homology motifs
in both treacle and Nopp140 reinforces previous observations of
functional similarities between these nucleolar proteins.

Zhang et al. (2002) reported that GPS2 (601935), a protein involved in
intracellular signaling, is an integral subunit of the NCOR1-HDAC3
(605166) complex. They determined structural motifs that direct the
formation of a highly stable and active deacetylase complex. GPS2 and
TBL1, another component of the NCOR1-HDAC3 complex, interact
cooperatively with repression domain-1 of NCOR1 to form a heterotrimeric
structure and are indirectly linked to HDAC3 via an extended NCOR1 SANT
domain that also activates latent HDAC3 activity. Zhang et al. (2002)
also showed that the NCOR1-HDAC3 complex inhibits JNK (601158)
activation through the associated GPS2 subunit and thus could
potentially provide an alternative mechanism for hormone-mediated
antagonism of AP1 (165160) function.

Yoon et al. (2003) purified NCOR complexes, which contained 10 to 12
proteins, from HeLa cell nuclear extracts and characterized the
interactions of TBL1 and TBLR1 (608628) with NCOR. TBL1 and TBLR1
interacted with NCOR through 2 independent interactions. Their
N-terminal regions interacted with the RD1 region of NCOR, and their
C-terminal WD40 repeats interacted with the RD4 region of NCOR. In
vitro, TBL1 and TBLR1 also bound histones H2B (see 609904) and H4 (see
602822), and transcriptional repression by TBL1 and TBLR1 correlated
with their interactions with histones. Using small interfering RNAs,
Yoon et al. (2003) demonstrated that HDAC3 was essential for repression
by unliganded thyroid hormone receptor. TBL1 and TBLR1 were also
essential, but they were functionally redundant.

Perissi et al. (2004) reported that transcriptional activation mediated
by liganded nuclear receptors requires the actions of 2 highly related F
box/WD40-containing factors, TBL1 and TBLR1. TBL1 and TBLR1 serve as
specific adaptors for recruitment of the ubiquitin-conjugating/19S
proteasome complex, with TBLR1 selectively serving to mediate a required
exchange of the nuclear receptor corepressors, NCOR and SMRT (600848),
for coactivators upon ligand binding. Tbl1 gene deletion in murine
embryonic stem cells severely impaired PPARG (601487)-induced adipogenic
differentiation, indicating that TBL1 function is biologically
indispensable for specific nuclear receptor-mediated gene activation
events. The role of TBLR1 and TBL1 in cofactor exchange also appeared to
operate for JUN (165160) and NFKB (see 164011), suggesting it is likely
to be prototypic of similar mechanisms for other signal-dependent
transcription factors.

Perissi et al. (2008) found that a large number of regulated
transcription factors required both TBL1 and TBLR1 to simultaneously
overcome the repressive functions of CTBP1 (602618)/CTBP2 (602619) and
NCOR/SMRT corepressor complexes, respectively. TBL1 was specifically
required to mediate ubiquitination and degradation of CTBP. Although
TBL1 and TBLR1 share a high degree of amino acid identity, the
specificity of their activities was regulated by phosphorylation at
nonhomologous sites. This phosphorylation was induced by receptor
ligands and occurred on TBL1 and TBLR1 prebound to regulated promoters.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bassi et al. (1999) found that the TBL1 gene contains 18 exons spanning
approximately 150 kb adjacent to the OA1 gene. Unlike OA1, TBL1 is
transcribed from telomere to centromere.

MAPPING

By FISH and interspecific backcross analysis, Disteche et al. (1998)
mapped the Tbl1 gene to the mouse X chromosome. The findings indicated
the presence of a previously unrecognized rearrangement between human
and mouse X chromosomes that involves the distal end of the short arm of
human X. Indeed, in the human, TBL1, OA1, and APXL (300103) are located
very close to each other in Xp22.3, spanning a genomic region of
approximately 400 kb. Mapping of their mouse homologs revealed 2 novel
rearrangements, with Oa1 and Apx1 still close to each other in
chromosome band F2-3 but Tbl1 located much more proximally in chromosome
bands B-C.

CYTOGENETICS

By genomic analysis, Bassi et al. (1999) found that the TBL1 gene was
either partly or entirely deleted in patients carrying Xp22.3 terminal
deletions. The complexity of the contiguous gene syndrome phenotype
shared by these patients was dependent on the number of known disease
genes involved in the deletions. One patient carrying a
microinterstitial deletion involving the 3-prime portion of both the
TBL1 and OA1 genes showed the OA1 phenotype associated with X-linked
late-onset sensorineural deafness. Bassi et al. (1999) postulated an
involvement of TBL1 in the pathogenesis of ocular albinism with
late-onset sensorineural deafness phenotype.

605326	TITLE *605326 TAX1-BINDING PROTEIN 1; TAX1BP1
;;HUMAN T-CELL LEUKEMIA VIRUS TYPE 1-BINDING PROTEIN;;
TXBP151;;
TRAF6-INTERACTING PROTEIN; T6BP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HTLV-1 Tax protein transcriptionally activates the HTLV-1 promoter.
Tax also binds to and stimulates the expression of cellular genes,
including transcription factors and other proteins (Gachon et al.,
1998).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse fibrosarcoma library with A20
(see TNFAIP3; 191163) as bait, followed by a screening of a HeLa cell
cDNA library, De Valck et al. (1999) isolated a TAX1BP1 cDNA, which the
authors termed TXBP151, encoding a 747-amino acid protein. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of 1.9- and 2.4-kb transcripts in various
cell lines. Western blot analysis showed that TAX1BP1 is expressed as an
86-kD or a 68-kD protein.

By a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library with TRAF6
(602355) as bait, Ling and Goeddel (2000) isolated a TAX1BP1 cDNA, which
they termed T6BP. Sequence analysis determined that TAX1BP1 contains 3
coiled-coil domains and 2 helix loop-helix regions.

GENE FUNCTION

De Valck et al. (1999) showed that overexpression of TAX1BP1 or A20
leads to apoptosis of NIH 3T3 cell lines, which could be partially
blocked by antisense TAX1BP1. Apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor
(TNF; 191160) or CD95 (134637) leads to TAX1BP1, but not A20,
degradation. This degradation could be blocked by CASP3 (600636)-like
inhibitors.

By coprecipitation and immunoblot analysis, Ling and Goeddel (2000)
showed that TAX1BP1 binds TRAF6 but not TRAFs 1-5; the interaction
requires the N-terminal zinc and ring finger domains of TRAF6 and either
the N-terminal first coiled-coil region or the 2 coiled-coil regions of
the C-terminus of TAX1BP1. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis
determined that stimulation of cells with IL1B (147720), but not with
TNF or CD40LG (see 300386), induces independent, mutually exclusive
TRAF6/TAX1BP1 complexes as well as TRAF6/IRAK (300283) complexes.
Transient expression of TRAF6, but not TAX1BP1, induces NFKB and JNK
(MAPK8; 601158) activation.

Shembade et al. (2010) showed that A20 inhibits the E3 ligase activities
of TRAF6, TRAF2 (601895), and cIAP1 (601712) by antagonizing
interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBC13 (603679) and
UBCH5C (602963). A20, together with the regulatory molecule TAX1BP1,
interacted with UBC13 and UBCH5C and triggered their ubiquitination and
proteasome-dependent degradation. These findings suggested a mechanism
of A20 action in the inhibition of inflammatory signaling pathways.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TAX1BP1
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP WI-11921).

603408	TITLE *603408 FRIZZLED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; FZD1
;;FZ1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Frizzled proteins, such as FZD1, are 7-transmembrane domain-containing
receptors whose extracellular cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) bind to Wnt
proteins (see 164975). Wnts are secreted cell signaling proteins
involved in development and homeostasis (summary by Zilberberg et al.,
2004).

CLONING

Sagara et al. (1998) cloned fetal lung cDNAs encoding FZD1, FZD2
(600667), and FZD7 (603410). The predicted 647-amino acid FZD1 protein
contains a signal peptide, a CRD in the N-terminal extracellular region,
7 transmembrane domains, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif. FZD1
shares 77% and 74% protein sequence identity with FZD2 and FZD7,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that FZD1 is expressed as
a 4.5-kb mRNA in various tissues.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Sagara et al. (1998) mapped the
FZD1 gene to 7q21.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2001) constructed a chimeric receptor with the
ligand-binding and transmembrane segments from the beta-2-adrenergic
receptor (109690) and the cytoplasmic domains from rat frizzled-1.
Stimulation of mouse F9 clones expressing the chimera with the
beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol stimulated stabilization of
beta-catenin (116806), activation of a beta-catenin-sensitive promoter,
and formation of primitive endoderm. The response was blocked by
inactivation of pertussis toxin-sensitive, heterotrimeric G proteins,
and by depletion of G-alpha-q (600998) and G-alpha-o (139311). Thus, Liu
et al. (2001) concluded that G proteins are elements of Wnt/frizzled-1
signaling to the beta-catenin-lymphoid-enhancer factor (LEF)-T-cell
factor (Tcf) pathway.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to renew themselves and
to give rise to all lineages of the blood. Reya et al. (2003) showed
that the WNT signaling pathway has an important role in this process.
Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in
long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in
their normal microenvironment activate a LEF1/TCF (153245) reporter,
which indicates that HSCs respond to WNT signaling in vivo. To
demonstrate the physiologic significance of this pathway for HSC
proliferation, Reya et al. (2003) showed that the ectopic expression of
axin (603816) or a frizzled ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the WNT
signaling pathway, led to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced
reconstitution in vivo. Furthermore, activation of WNT signaling in HSCs
induced increased expression of HOXB4 (142965) and NOTCH1 (190198),
genes previously implicated in self-renewal of HSCs. Reya et al. (2003)
concluded that the WNT signaling pathway is critical for normal HSC
homeostasis in vitro and in vivo, and provide insight into a potential
molecular hierarchy of regulation of HSC development.

Zilberberg et al. (2004) noted that members of the low density
lipoprotein receptor family, including LRP5 (603506) and LRP6 (603507),
interact with frizzled receptors and function as Wnt coreceptors. Using
transfected HEK293 cells, they showed that LRP1 (107770), as well as a
C-terminal fragment of LRP1 that mimics the full-length protein, bound
the CRD of human FZ1 and inhibited FZ1-dependent Wnt signaling. LRP1 did
not mediate FZ1 internalization and degradation, but sequestered FZ1 and
inhibited its formation of a functional Wnt signaling complex with LRP6.

142860	TITLE *142860 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS II, DR ALPHA; HLA-DRA
;;HLA-DRA1;;
HLA-DR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY TYPE;;
HLA-D HISTOCOMPATIBILITY TYPE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules present
antigens to CD4 (186940)-positive cells. Human class II MHC molecules
are of 3 major isotypes, HLA-DR, HLA-DP (see 142880), and HLA-DQ (see
146880), each of which consists of an alpha and a beta chain. Both the
alpha and beta chains of HLA-DP and HLA-DQ are polymorphic, whereas
HLA-DR alpha (HLA-DRA) is invariant and HLA-DR beta (HLA-DRB; see
142857) is polymorphic. Thus, differences in the HLA-DR beta chain
account for different peptide-binding motifs of HLA-DR molecules (Dai et
al., 2008).

Lee et al. (1982) described 2 cDNA clones containing sequences
corresponding to HLA-DR antigens, specifically the 34,000 MW
glycoprotein chain. The authors stated that the heavy chain is largely
invariant and that the light chain (MW about 28,000) carries the major
polymorphic determinants. Other HLA-D/DR-associated antigens with
different heavy and light chains (also called alpha and beta,
respectively) have been identified on B cells (Accolla et al., 1981;
Shackelford et al., 1981).

Korman et al. (1982) provided information on the primary structure of
the heavy and light chains of DR. The HLA-DR antigen heterodimer
consists of 4 extracellular domains, 2 of which are Ig-like (1 in the
heavy chain, alpha-2, and 1 in the light chain, beta-2). The third is
the amino-terminal polymorphic domain of the light chain (beta-1), and
the fourth is an invariant domain in the heavy chain (alpha-1). Both the
light and the heavy chains have a large glycosylated amino-terminal
extracellular region, a small hydrophobic membranous region, and a small
hydrophilic carboxy-terminal region; in this they resemble class I MHC
antigens. Kaufman and Strominger (1982) applied limited proteolysis to
demonstrate further that the extracellular region of the light chain
consists of 2 domains, each with a disulfide loop. The amino-terminal
domain bears the carbohydrate and is polymorphic, while the
carboxy-terminal domain is relatively conserved and has significant
amino acid homology with immunoglobulins. In DR, it is the light chain
that is polymorphic; in class I antigens, beta-2-microglobulin is
invariant or highly conserved. Larhammar et al. (1982) likewise
commented on similarities to both the immunoglobulins and the class I
MHC antigens. They referred to the 2 chains of the class II molecules as
alpha and beta. They provided the complete nucleotide sequence of a
beta-chain gene and deduced the corresponding amino acid sequence.
Kratzin et al. (1981) published the sequence of another beta chain which
shows about 70% homology with the one reported by Larhammar et al.
(1982). This is consistent with the conclusion that the HLA-D region
contains at least 2 (Accolla et al., 1981) and probably more
(Shackelford et al., 1981) genes for class II antigens.

The DR, DP (146880), and DQ (142880) gene products resemble each other
fairly closely and also resemble Ia of the mouse. They are heterodimers
of 1 alpha, or heavy, chain (MW 33,000) and 1 beta, or light, chain (MW
28,000). The serologic specificity resides mainly in the beta chain
(Erlich et al., 1983).

Walker et al. (1983) determined the N-terminal amino acid sequences of
the alpha and beta chains of HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR2 antigens. No
differences were found in the alpha chains. However, in the first 35
N-terminal residues of the beta chains, 2 regions of variability were
apparent, each comprising about 6 amino acids. The authors suggested
that these variable regions may be responsible for the serologically
defined polymorphism of HLA-DR antigens.

MAPPING

Location of at least one HLA-DR heavy chain gene on chromosome 6 was
confirmed by analysis of DNA from man-mouse somatic cell hybrids by
Southern transfer of restriction endonuclease transfers. The sequences
coding for HLA-DR heavy chain appear to be present in only one or a few
copies in the genome and to be relatively simple in structure (Lee et
al., 1982).

By studies of a cell line with a small visible deletion of 6p, Erlich et
al. (1983) mapped the alpha chain of HLA-DR to 6p2105-6p23. The genes
for all the class I antigens map in the same region. Under conditions of
high stringency and considering the most intensely hybridizing bands, 1
gene locus each was recognized by HLA-DR alpha and HLA-DR beta probes
and 2 by the HLA-DC beta probe (Levine et al., 1984). By study of
variants with various breakpoints, they defined 3 subregions in the
following order from centromere distally: subregion I, HLA-DC beta-1;
subregion II, HLA-DC beta-2 and HLA-DR alpha; subregion III, HLA-DR
beta. Both the alpha and the beta chains map to the HLA region. (In the
case of the class I antigens, only the alpha chain maps to the HLA
region; the beta chain, beta-2-microglobulin, maps to chromosome 15.)
There are about 25 copies of HLA class I genes and 15, in all, of alpha
and beta class II genes. The class III genes, C2, BF, C4A, C4B, are
present in single copy. The beta chain is responsible for DR
polymorphism. Class II molecules, located predominantly on B cells and
macrophages, play a key role in immune response, functioning in the
presentation of antigen to regulatory T lymphocytes.

Strominger (1986) indicated that the findings with DNA probes 'suggest
that the multiple HLA-DR light chains and the multiple HLA-DR heavy
chains are encoded in a 5 centimorgan region of human 6p'--specifically,
6p21.1.

Hardy et al. (1986) reported mapping studies of the class II region by
means of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Their findings,
together with linkage studies and data on linkage disequilibrium,
indicate that the order of the class II genes is
centromere--DP--DZ-alpha--DO-beta--DX (HLA-DQA2;
613503)--DQ--DR-beta--DR-alpha. The map order indicates that DQ
molecules are analogous to the I-A molecules in the mouse and that DR
molecules are analogous to the products of the murine I-E locus. No
recombination between DQ and DR genes had been reported and alleles of
these genes are in very strong linkage disequilibrium. In contrast, a
high recombination frequency of about 1 to 3% is found between DP genes
and DQ-DR genes. Furthermore, there is very little linkage
disequilibrium between DP and DR alleles. These observations suggest
that either the DP subregion is located some distance centromeric to the
DQ-DR subregions or that a recombination 'hotspot' exists between DP and
DQ-DR. The results of Hardy et al. (1986) excluded the first possibility
as the distance between DP and DQ is similar to the distance separating
DQ and DR. See also HLA-DQB1 (604305).

- Reviews

Strominger (1986) and Auffray and Strominger (1986) gave superb
discussions of the molecular structure of the HLA system, particularly
the class II region and also presented a useful map of the region and a
hypothesis for the generation of autoimmunity that depends on somatic
mutation in the immune system.

Trowsdale (1987) provided a useful review of the molecular genetics of
the class II antigens, including his latest version of the working map
of the human HLA-D region.

EVOLUTION

Mayer et al. (1993) showed that a retrovirus related to the mouse
mammary tumor viruses was inserted into intron 1 of DRB6 more than 23
million years ago. The insertion was either accompanied or followed by
the deletion of exon 1 in the promoter region of DRB6. In the 3-prime
long terminal repeat (LTR) of the retrovirus, however, an open reading
frame for a new exon arose, which codes for a sequence that could
function as a leader for the truncated DRB6 gene. The new exon has a
functional donor splice site at its 3-prime end which enables it to be
spliced in register with DRB6 exon 2. Upstream from the new exon is a
promoter enabling transcription of the DRB6 gene. Besides providing an
example of a de novo generation of an exon, the study suggested a
potential mechanism for generating new genes through the replacement of
old exons with newly generated ones.

GENE FUNCTION

By pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Dunham et al. (1989) found
differences in the amount of DNA present in the DQ and DR subregions of
the class II region dependent on the DR type. Specifically, cell lines
that carry DR2 had about 30 kb more DNA within the DR subregion than
those that carry DR3, DR5, or DR6. The DR4 haplotype had an additional
110 kb of DNA within the DQ or DR subregion compared to DR3, DR5, and
DR6. These haplotype-specific differences may be of significance for the
maintenance of linkage disequilibrium within the DR and DQ subregions
and the low frequency of recombination between DQ and DR.

Moen et al. (1980) concluded that HLA-DR matching of cadaveric kidneys
improves survival of the transplanted organ.

Tiercy et al. (1988) demonstrated micropolymorphism undetectable by
serologic typing procedures which should permit more accurate HLA
matching for transplantation and for more precise correlations between
HLA and disease susceptibility. Micropolymorphism was detected by
hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides, a method they
referred to as HLA oligotyping.

Chelladurai et al. (1991) demonstrated that HLA-DR has procoagulant
activity and suggested that it is responsible for thromboembolic
complications in cancer patients and in recipients of mismatched organ
transplants.

Olerup et al. (1991) investigated DRB-DQA-DQB gene polymorphism by TaqI
restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in West Africans and
found polymorphism to be almost twice as extensive in this population as
in North European Caucasians. They interpreted this finding as
indicating that Africans comprise the oldest and genetically most
diverse human population and supporting the hypothesis of a population
bottleneck in the emergence of the white race. They could find little
evidence for parasite-driven overdominant selection and proposed instead
that one of the forces maintaining a low frequency of HLA homozygotes
might be a decreased likelihood of potentially autoreactive T-cell
clones escaping thymic selection in HLA heterozygotes. This would be
consistent with the central role of HLA molecules as self/nonself
discriminators.

Terasaki et al. (1976) described a high frequency of a B-lymphocyte
antigen (group 4) in multiple sclerosis (MS; see 126200). Association
with HLA-A3, HLA-B7, and HLA-Dw2 has been demonstrated also.

In a multistage genomewide association study involving a total of 1,540
multiple sclerosis family trios, 2,322 case subjects, and 5,418 control
subjects, the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium
(2007) used the HLA-DRA A/G SNP dbSNP rs3135388 as a proxy for the
DRB1*1501 allele (complete concordance between the dbSNP rs3135388 A
allele and DRB1*1501 was found in 2730 of 2757 subjects in whom data
were available) and confirmed unequivocally that the HLA-DRA locus was
associated with MS (p = 8.94 X 10(-81); OR, 1.99).

Ferber et al. (1999) evaluated the association of HLA class II alleles
DR and DQ with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and the postpartum
development of IDDM (222100). DR3 allele frequency was significantly
increased in 43 women with islet autoantibodies, in particular in those
with glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA), or in the 24
women who developed IDDM postpartum. In women with GADA, DR4 and
DQB1*0302 were significantly elevated. Twenty-five (59.5%) islet
antibody-positive women and 17 (74%) women who developed IDDM postpartum
had a DR3- or DR4-containing genotype. The cumulative risk to develop
IDDM within 2 years postpartum in GDM women with either DR3 or DR4 was
22%, compared to 7% in women without those alleles and rose to 50% in
the DR3- or DR4-positive women who had required insulin during
pregnancy. Combining the determination of the susceptible HLA alleles
DR3 and DR4 with islet autoantibody measurement increased the
sensitivity of identifying GDM women developing postpartum IDDM to 92%,
but did not improve risk assessment above that achieved using GADA
measurement alone, which was the strongest predictor of IDDM.

Kent et al. (2005) examined T cells from pancreatic draining lymph
nodes, the site of islet cell-specific self-antigen presentation. They
cloned single T cells in a nonbiased manner from pancreatic draining
lymph nodes of patients with type I diabetes and from nondiabetic
controls. A high degree of T-cell clonal expansion was observed in
pancreatic lymph nodes from long-term diabetic patients but not from
controls. The oligoclonally expanded T cells from diabetic patients with
DR4, a susceptibility allele for type I diabetes, recognized the insulin
A 1-15 epitope restricted by DR4. Kent et al. (2005) concluded that
their results identified insulin-reactive, clonally expanded T cells
from the site of autoinflammatory drainage in long-term type I
diabetics, indicating that insulin may indeed be the target antigen
causing autoimmune diabetes.

Expression of HLA-DR antigen and ICAM1 in human conjunctival epithelium
is upregulated in patients with dry eyes associated with Sjogren
syndrome (270150). Tsubota et al. (1999) reported that this upregulation
in Sjogren syndrome patients may be controlled by interferon-gamma
(147570) through the activation of transcription factor NFKB (nuclear
factor kappa-B; see 164011).

Pisella et al. (2000) reported that a significant increase of HLA-DR and
ICAM1 expression by epithelial cells was consistently found in patients
with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (Sjogren syndrome) compared with
expression in normal eyes. These 2 markers were well correlated with
each other and correlated inversely with tear break-up time and tear
production as measured by the Schirmer test. The percentage of
conjunctival goblet cells was significantly decreased in dry eye
patients with a significant negative correlation with both HLA-DR and
ICAM1 markers.

By adulthood, 90% of the population in West Africa have been infected
with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Thursz et al. (1997) noted that in most
people this is manifest as an asymptomatic self-limiting infection
during childhood, but approximately 15% of patients develop a persistent
infection, and this often results in chronic liver disease and
hepatocellular carcinoma. Because HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma
is commonly a disease of working-age males in West Africa, resistance to
HBV persistence probably confers some reproductive advantage. Almarri
and Batchelor (1994) found that particular HLA class II region
haplotypes affect the probability that an HBV infection will become
persistent. Thursz et al. (1997) presented evidence supporting models of
overdominant selection in which MHC homozygotes are less likely to clear
an HBV infection and thus more likely to become persistently infected.
In tests of 632 Gambian subjects of whom 223 had evidence of persistent
infection and 409 had successfully cleared the virus, they found no
differences in the class I loci; however, significantly fewer subjects
with persistent infection were heterozygous for haplotypes of the HLA
class II region genes, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

HLA-DRA gene and susceptibility to the development of Parkinson disease,
see 168600.

NOMENCLATURE

Bodmer et al. (1990) presented a consensus on nomenclature for factors
in the HLA system. The HLA-DR molecule has a single species of alpha
chain encoded by the HLA-DRA gene. In the case of the beta chain, there
are DRB1, DRB3 (612735), DRB4, and DRB5 genes. (DRB2 is a pseudogene
with DR-beta-like sequences.) HLA-DRB6 is a truncated gene in both
humans and chimpanzees, lacking exon 1, which normally codes for the
leader and the first 4 amino acid residues of the mature protein.
However, a human DRB6 exon 2 sequence has been obtained by PCR
amplification of cDNA reversely transcribed from RNA of a B-cell line,
implying that the DRB6 gene is, in fact, transcribed.

HISTORY

Dupont et al. (1974) suggested that the genetic control of stimulation
in the mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) reaction in man is determined by a
separate gene, which they called MLR-S (HLA-D), closely linked to the
FOUR locus of the HLA-A (142800) chromosomal region. They reported 3
children with recombination between the FOUR and MLR-S locus in 2
families and confirmed that the MLR-S locus is located outside the HLA-A
chromosomal region.

In addition to HLA-D, genes controlling secondary mixed lymphocyte
response were assigned to the HLA-A region (Eijsvoogel et al., 1972) and
to SB (142880), a region at least 2 cM proximal to HLA-D. Mempel et al.
(1973) came to the same conclusion.

The focus of the 7th International Workshop on Histocompatibility
Testing held in Oxford in August 1977 was the definition of determinants
present only in B lymphocytes. By analogy to the H-2 nomenclature in the
mouse, these antigens have been called Ia (immune-associated). The
Oxford workshop identified 7 specificities as defined by homozygous
typing cells (HTC) in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) tests. These were
designated DRw, for D-related and workshop, i.e., tentative. It was not
certain whether the Dw and DRw specificities were determined by the same
gene or by genes at 2 separate but closely linked loci. It was concluded
that the 7 DRw specificities are determined by codominant alleles. In
the mouse, and presumably in man, there are lymphocyte alloantigens,
designated Ia (immune response-associated) antigens, found mainly on B
lymphocytes. The existence of immune response-associated antigens in man
is highly probable because of the close homology of the H-2 and HLA
regions in mouse and man. See McDevitt and Bodmer (1974) for discussion
and references.

Mann et al. (1975, 1976) demonstrated 2 separate genetic loci for
B-lymphocyte alloantigens in the HLA region. These were demonstrated
using sera derived from multiparous Amish women and testing large Amish
families. HLA-A (142800), HLA-B (142830), and HLA-C (142840) are
serologically defined antigens found on both T and B lymphocytes.
Antigens tested for by mixed lymphocyte reactions appear to be expressed
only in B lymphocytes. The relation of the serologically demonstrated
B-lymphocyte alloantigens to those demonstrated by MLC was not
established. Mann et al. (1975) suggested identity to the Ia antigens of
the mouse. There may be more than 2 loci for B alloantigens in the HLA
area. The Histocompatibility Workshop 1977 was unable to distinguish
with certainty between Ia and HLA-D, i.e., that separate loci are
represented was not established.

Markert and Cresswell (1980) concluded that HLA-DR specificity is
carried on the alpha subunit. A second type of specificity, called MB,
is thought to be determined by a locus closely linked to HLA-DR and,
from studies of Markert and Cresswell (1980), may reside on the beta
subunit. They found that a third closely linked gene locus, MT,
determines Ia antigen-like molecules distinct from those carrying MB and
HLA-DR determinants. HLA-DR in man and Ia in the mouse are termed class
II histocompatibility antigens. One hypothesis to account for the
relationship between MT and DR is that the DR locus is a complex one
that has 3 (or more) 'tightly linked loci, similar to the Rh locus. As
in the Gm system, the product of this complex gene could be located on
separate domains of the gene products. Thus, MT1, DR1, and MT5 could be
on 3 different sites of the Ia molecule, while being determined by a
single complex locus' (Park et al., 1980).

601575	TITLE *601575 FOS-LIKE ANTIGEN 2; FOSL2
;;FOS-RELATED ANTIGEN 2; FRA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Matsui et al. (1990) isolated a FRA2 cDNA by screening human cDNA
libraries using FOS (164810) as a probe. The FRA2 open reading frame
encodes a 326-amino acid protein with the leucine zipper domain and
C-terminal region conserved in the FOS family.

GENE FAMILY

The FOS gene family consists of 4 members: FOS, FOSB (164772), FRA1
(136515), and FRA2 (Molven et al., 1996). These genes encode leucine
zipper proteins that can dimerize with proteins of the JUN family (see
165160), thereby forming the transcription factor complex AP-1. As such,
the FOS proteins have been implicated as regulators of cell
proliferation, differentiation, and transformation. In some cases,
expression of the FOS gene has also been associated with apoptotic cell
death.

GENE FUNCTION

Bozec et al. (2008) demonstrated that the FOS-related protein FRA2
controls osteoclast survival and size. They observed that bones of
Fra2-deficient newborn mice had giant osteoclasts, and signaling through
leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF; 159540) and its receptor (LIFR; 151443)
was impaired. Similarly, newborn animals lacking Lif had giant
osteoclasts, and Bozec et al. (2008) demonstrated that LIF is a direct
transcriptional target of FRA2 and c-JUN (604641). Moreover, bones
deficient in Fra2 and Lif were hypoxic and expressed increased levels of
hypoxia-induced factor 1-alpha (HIF1A; 603348) and Bcl2 (151430).
Overexpression of Bcl2 was sufficient to induce giant osteoclasts in
vivo, whereas Fra2 and Lif affected Hif1a through transcriptional
modulation of the Hif prolyl hydroxylase Phd2 (606425). This pathway is
operative in the placenta, because specific inactivation of Fra2 in the
embryo alone did not cause hypoxia or the giant osteoclast phenotype.
Bozec et al. (2008) concluded that thus, placenta-induced hypoxia during
embryogenesis leads to the formation of giant osteoclasts in young pups.

MAPPING

Molven et al. (1996) assigned FRA2 to chromosome 2p23-p22 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

614194	TITLE *614194 DEDICATOR OF CYTOKINESIS 6; DOCK6
;;KIAA1395
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DOCK6 is a member of the conserved DOCK family of atypical guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that lack a catalytic DBL (MCF2;
311030) homology domain. DOCK6 belongs to subfamily C of the DOCK family
and has a role in remodeling the actin cytoskeleton by functioning as a
GEF for both CDC42 (116952) and RAC1 (602048) Miyamoto et al. (2007).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned DOCK6, which they designated
KIAA1395. The deduced protein contains 1,628 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected variable DOCK6 expression in all adult and fetal tissues and
adult brain regions examined, with highest expression in ovary, lung,
heart, and kidney, and lowest expression in spleen.

By searching a database for sequences similar to DOCK180 (DOCK1;
601403), Cote and Vuori (2002) identified DOCK6. The deduced protein
contains an N-terminal domain of over 200 amino acids and a C-terminal
domain of over 500 amino acids that share significant similarity with
other DOCK proteins. Cote and Vuori (2002) called these regions DOCK
homology region-1 (DHR1) and DHR2, respectively. DHR2 was predicted to
function in guanine nucleotide exchange.

Miyamoto et al. (2007) found that transfected COS-7 cells expressed
epitope-tagged human DOCK6 DHR2 near the cell surface and in the
perinuclear region. Western blot analysis of mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma
cells showed that full-length mouse Dock6 had an apparent molecular mass
of 200 kD.

By quantitative RT-PCR of adult mouse tissues, Shaheen et al. (2011)
detected highest Dock6 expression in lung and heart, with lower
expression in brain, cerebellum, eye, kidney, liver, and spleen. In situ
hybridization of mouse embryos showed that Dock6 was expressed in the
growing edge of limb buds and in heart at embryonic day 9.5. By
embryonic day 13.5, Dock6 expression was more concentrated in developing
digits.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shaheen et al. (2011) determined that the DOCK6 gene contains 48 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the DOCK6 gene
to chromosome 19. Hartz (2011) mapped the DOCK6 gene to chromosome
19p13.2 based on an alignment of the DOCK6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AB037816) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using full-length human DOCK6 or the isolated DHR2 of DOCK6 expressed in
E. coli, Miyamoto et al. (2007) showed that DOCK6 functioned as a GEF
for RAC1 and CDC42, but not for RHOA (165390). Similar to other DOCK
proteins, the isolated DHR2 of DOCK6 showed higher activity than
full-length DOCK6. Transfection of COS-7 cells with human DOCK6 DHR2
increased the number of cells displaying both lamellipodia and
filopodia, which are markers of Rac1 and Cdc42 activation, respectively.
Dock6 mRNA and protein were induced upon differentiation in mouse
N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, concomitant with increased levels of
GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42. Overexpression of human DOCK6 DHR2 promoted
neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous
Dock6 in N1E-115 cells inhibited neurite outgrowth after induction of
differentiation. Miyamoto et al. (2007) concluded that DOCK6 functions
as a GEF for RAC1 and CDC42 and has a role in cytoskeletal remodeling
and neurite outgrowth.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 unrelated Arab girls with autosomal recessive Adams-Oliver
syndrome-2 (AOS2; 614219), Shaheen et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for 2 different truncating mutations in the DOCK6 gene (614194.0001 and
614194.0002, respectively) that segregated with disease in each family.

In affected individuals from 2 consanguineous Arab families with AOS who
shared a region of homozygosity overlapping the DOCK6 gene, Shaheen et
al. (2013) identified homozygous mutations in DOCK6 (614914.0003 and
614914.0004, respectively).

DOCK6, 4-BP DEL, 1362AACT

In an 11-month-old Arab girl with Adams-Oliver syndrome-2 (AOS2;
614219), born of double first-cousin parents, Shaheen et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (1362delAACT) in the DOCK6
gene, predicted to result in a mutant protein lacking the 2 fundamental
domains, DHR1 and DHR2. Her unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. Examination of cytoskeletal organization in patient
fibroblasts showed that approximately 16% of cells assumed a rounded
phenotype that was not observed in control cells; patient cells also
assumed an unusual elongated morphology and lacked lamellipodia and
lateral ruffles.

In a 3.5-year-old Arab girl with Adams-Oliver syndrome-2 (614219), born
of unaffected first-cousin parents, Shaheen et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp duplication (1245dupT) in the DOCK6 gene,
predicted to result in a mutant protein lacking the 2 fundamental

In a 12-month old Arab boy with Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS2; 614219),
born of first-cousin parents, Shaheen et al. (2013) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp duplication (c.2520dupT) in the DOCK6 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and introduction of a premature termination
codon (Arg841SerfsTer6). The patient's affected sister exhibited
gastroschisis in addition to other features of AOS.

ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME 2
DOCK6, IVS32AS, G-C, -1

In a 2-year-old girl Arab girl with Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS2;

homozygosity for a c.4107-1G-C transversion at the splice acceptor site
in intron 32 of the DOCK6 gene. RT-PCR confirmed that the mutation
replaces the consensus acceptor site by a cryptic site in the downstream
exon (exon 33), leading to the loss of 7 bp from exon 33 and causing a
frameshift that results in a premature termination codon
(Thr1370MetfsTer19).

604997	TITLE *604997 DOCKING PROTEIN 2; DOK2
;;DOCKING PROTEIN, 56-KD;;
p56DOK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; 608232) is characterized by the
presence of the Philadelphia chromosome translocation t(9;22) and the
resulting p210-bcr/abl chimeric protein-tyrosine kinase (see 151410). Di
Cristofano et al. (1998) described the purification, cloning, and
characterization of a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, p56dok (DOK2),
from a megakaryoblastic cell line expressing p210-bcr/abl (Mo/p210). The
DOK2 cDNA clone encodes a 412-amino acid protein with a molecular mass
of 53 to 56 kD. The DOK2 protein has a potential pleckstrin homology
(PH) domain at the N terminus, 13 potential tyrosine phosphorylation
sites, 6 PXXP motifs, and 2 YXXPXD motifs (predicted Ras-GAP (139150)
SH2 domain binding sites). It shares 34.8% overall amino acid identity
with another tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, p62dok (DOK1; 602919),
which also contains a predicted PH domain at its N terminus. Di
Cristofano et al. (1998) defined a DOK homology sequence motif within 50
amino acids of the central core region of the proteins. Northern blot
analysis revealed that both DOK1 and DOK2 are highly expressed in cells
and tissues of hematopoietic origin as well as in lung.

MAPPING

Berger et al. (2010) stated that the DOK2 gene maps to chromosome
8p21.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Immunoprecipitation experiments by Di Cristofano et al. (1998) showed
that expression of bcr/abl induces additional tyrosine phosphorylation
of the DOK1 and DOK2 proteins and their association with Ras-GAP. The
authors speculated that DOK association regulates GAP activity toward
Ras and that the DOK proteins serve as mediators of bcr-abl signaling.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yasuda et al. (2004) generated mice lacking Dok1 and/or Dok2 and found
that double-knockout mice succumbed to myeloproliferative disease
resembling human CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The
double-knockout mice had medullary and extramedullary hyperplasia of
granulocyte/macrophage progenitors with leukemic potential, and their
myeloid cells showed hyperproliferation and hypoapoptosis upon treatment
with and deprivation of cytokines, respectively. Cytokine stimulation
enhanced Erk (see 176872) and Akt (see 164730) activation in mutant
myeloid cells. Yasuda et al. (2004) concluded that DOK1 and DOK2 are key
negative regulators of cytokine responses and are essential for myeloid
homeostasis and leukemia suppression.

Independently, Niki et al. (2004) observed aberrant hemopoiesis and
CML-like lymphoproliferative disease in Dok1 and Dok2 double-knockout
mice. Single-knockout mice displayed normal steady-state hemopoiesis.

Shinohara et al. (2005) found that macrophages from mice lacking Dok1 or
Dok2 displayed elevated activation of Erk (MAPK3; 601795), but not other
MAPKs or Nfkb (see 164011), upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), but not other Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, resulting in
hyperproduction of Tnf (190160) and nitric oxide. LPS also induced high
Tnf production in vivo in mice lacking Dok1 or Dok2. Forced expression
of Dok1 or Dok2 in macrophages inhibited LPS-induced Erk activation and
Tnf production, but not if Dok1 had a tyr336-to-phe or tyr340-to-phe
mutation. Shinohara et al. (2005) concluded that DOK1 and DOK2 are
essential negative regulators downstream of TLR4 (603030).

Berger et al. (2010) found that mice with knockout of Dok1, Dok2, or
Dok3 (611435) each developed lung adenocarcinoma (211980). Mice with
double-knockouts of different combinations of these 3 genes developed
lung adenocarcinoma at an earlier age and with high penetrance,
suggesting that the proteins have partially redundant or overlapping
functions. Compared to wildtype lung tissue, Dok-mutant tumors showed
moderate staining for phosphorylated Akt and strong staining for
phosphorylated Erk. Immunohistochemical studies on isolated cells showed
that the tumor cells arose from a population of bronchioalveolar stem
cells with inactivation of the Dok proteins. These findings were
consistent with a model of tumorigenesis in which inactivation of the
Dok1, Dok2, and Dok3 genes leads to hyperactivation of Akt and Erk, and
an expansion of the stem cells that differentiate into alveolar type II
cells. Among 199 primary human lung adenocarcinoma samples, 37% showed a
deletion of 1 copy of DOK2, and the loss correlated with loss of protein
expression. In Dok-mutant mice, haploinsufficiency of Dok2 was
sufficient for tumor formation, as the wildtype allele was retained in
most tumor samples. Berger et al. (2010) concluded that the findings
were consistent for a tumor-suppressor role for DOK2 in human lung
cancer.

120216	TITLE *120216 COLLAGEN, TYPE V, ALPHA-3; COL5A3
DESCRIPTION Type V collagen is distributed in vertebrate tissues as a heterotrimer
of 3 different polypeptide chains, alpha-1 (COL5A1, 120215), alpha-2
(COL5A1, 120190), and alpha-3 (COL5A3), a heterotrimer of 2 copies of
alpha-1 and 1 copy of alpha-2, or a homotrimer of alpha-1 polypeptides.
For additional background information on collagen V, see 120215.

CLONING

By database searching, screening of cDNA libraries, and nested PCR,
Imamura et al. (2000) cloned full-length human and mouse COL5A3 cDNAs
encoding 1,745- and 1,739-amino acid proteins, respectively. COL5A3 is
most similar to the fibrillar procollagens COL5A1, COL11A1 (120280), and
COL11A2 (120290). Dot-blot analysis demonstrated particularly high
levels of COL5A3 expression in mammary gland, high levels in placenta,
uterus, fetal heart and lung, and moderately high levels in adult heart
and brain. Relatively high levels of COL5A1 and COL5A2 were found in
most of the same tissues, indicating the presence of heterotrimers of
the collagen V alpha chains in these tissues. An exception was adult
brain, in which the levels of COL5A3 were not matched by those of the
other two. Northern blot analysis detected particularly high expression
of an approximately 6.0-kb transcript in heart, placenta, and uterus.
Smaller bands of approximately 4.2 kb and 5.5 kb were found in brain and
lung, respectively. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos detected
Col5a3 expression primarily in the epimysial sheaths of developing
muscles and within nascent ligaments adjacent to forming bones and in
joints.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Imamura et al. (2000) mapped the COL5A3
gene to chromosome 19p13.2. By interspecific backcross analysis, they
mapped the mouse homolog to a region of syntenic homology on proximal
chromosome 9.

600303	TITLE *600303 RAP GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 1; RAPGEF1
;;GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-RELEASING FACTOR 2; GRF2;;
CRK SH3-BINDING GNRP; C3G
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By Far Western screening of a human spleen lambda-gt11 expression
library using the SH3 domain of CRK (164762) as probe, Tanaka et al.
(1994) isolated a cDNA clone corresponding to RAPGEF1, which they called
C3G. Additional clones from human spleen and placenta cDNA libraries
were obtained by plaque hybridization with the (32)P-labeled spleen cDNA
clone. The deduced 1,077-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular
mass of 121 kD and contains a central proline-rich SH3-binding domain
and a C-terminal region homologous to guanine nucleotide-releasing
proteins (GNRP) for RAS, such as RASGRF1 (606600) and SOS1 (182530).
Northern blot analysis of human adult and fetal tissues detected a
7.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined with highest expression in
skeletal muscle, placenta, and fetal heart and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanaka et al. (1994) showed that CRK and C3G coimmunoprecipitated in
transfected rabbit kidney cells. Deletion analysis showed that the CRK
SH3 domain interacted with a 50-amino acid proline-rich sequence in C3G.
The authors suggested that the complex of C3G and CRK or C3G and
GRB2/ASH (108355) transduces signals from tyrosine kinases to RAS in a
number of different tissues.

The RAS-CRK-RAP1 (179520) cellular signal transduction system is
regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Transcription
of C3G is activated by the CRK adaptor protein. Hirata et al. (2004)
documented the amplification of C3G in 5 of 18 primary nonsmall cell
lung cancers examined and its increased expression in 18 of 28 tumors in
comparison to corresponding noncancerous lung tissues. The data were
interpreted as indicating that amplification and increased expression of
the C3G gene may play some role in human lung carcinogenesis through
derangement of the CRK-RAP1 signaling pathway.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Takai et al. (1994) mapped the
RAPGEF1 gene to chromosome 9q34.3, where chromosomal changes have been
reported in human hematopoietic malignancies.

604067	TITLE *604067 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 9; RGS9
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the RGS family, such as RGS9, are signaling proteins that
suppress the activity of G proteins by promoting their deactivation.

CLONING

He et al. (1998) identified RGS9 as the mammalian rod outer segment
phototransduction GAP (GTPase-accelerating protein).

Burchett et al. (1998) isolated rat striatum cDNAs encoding several RGS
proteins, including RGS9.

By searching an EST database for homologs of rat RGS9, Granneman et al.
(1998) identified a human cDNA encoding an RGS9 isoform that they called
RGS9L. The predicted 674-amino acid human RGS9L protein contains an
N-terminal DEP (dishevelled, egl10, pleckstrin) domain, an RGS domain,
and a C-terminal region highly enriched in proline and serine residues.
Granneman et al. (1998) reported that the mouse and bovine retinal forms
of RGS9 isolated by He et al. (1998) represent an alternatively spliced
isoform, which they designated RGS9S. RGS9S lacks the C-terminal
proline-rich domain found in RGS9L. Northern blot analysis and nuclease
protection assays indicated that forebrain regions receiving dopamine
innervation, such as striatum, hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens,
express RGS9L, while retina and pineal gland express RGS9S almost
exclusively. This tissue-specific splicing pattern appeared to be highly
conserved between human and rodents, suggesting cell-specific
differences in the function of these isoforms. RGS9S and RGS9L are
encoded by 9- and 2.5-kb mRNAs, respectively.

Zhang et al. (1999) cloned RGS9 variants, which they designated RGS9-1
and RGS9-2, from a retina cDNA library. Northern blot analysis indicated
that the major transcript in retina is a 9.5-kb mRNA encoding RGS9-1,
and the major transcript in brain is a 2.5-kb mRNA encoding RGS9-2. PCR
analysis of retina detected RGS9-2 at a much lower level than RGS9-1.
The RGS9-1 and RGS9-2 variants result from alternative splicing of exon
17 and encode proteins of 484 and 671 amino acids, respectively. Both
proteins share DEP, GGL (G protein gamma subunit-like), and RGS domains,
but RGS9-1 has an 18-residue C terminus, whereas RGS9-2 has a
205-residue, proline-rich C terminus. Zhang et al. (1999) also cloned
RGS9-1 and RGS9-2 variants with a 9-bp insertion at the 3-prime end of
exon 6, resulting in 3 additional amino acids in the proteins. Western
blot analysis of retina detected RGS9-1 at an apparent molecular mass of
58 kD, and Western blot analysis of brain detected RGS9-2 at an apparent
molecular mass of 70 kD, both in line with their expected masses.
Immunocytochemical analysis of bovine and human retina found strong RGS9
staining of cones, weak staining of rods, and punctate staining of
photoreceptor cell bodies. Weak staining was also detected in the inner
retina, possibly in amacrine cells.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (1998) found that the RGS domain of RGS9 accelerated GTP
hydrolysis by transducin, the visual G protein (see 189970).

Granneman et al. (1998) showed that, when expressed in mammalian cells,
RGS9L suppressed signaling mediated by Gi, the inhibitory GTP-binding
regulator of adenylate cyclase (see 139310). They stated that this was
probably due to RGS9L acting as a GAP.

Makino et al. (1999) reported that the GAP for transducin in rod
photoreceptors is a tight complex between RGS9 and the long splice
variant of G protein beta-5 (GNB5; 604447).

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Hu and Wensel (2002) determined that
bovine Rgs9 was associated with a heterotetrameric complex containing
R9ap (607814), Gnb5, and Gnat (see 139330) in detergent-solubilized rod
outer segment (ROS) membranes. R9ap interacted specifically with the
N-terminal domain of Rgs9. Hu and Wensel (2002) concluded that the
C-terminal transmembrane domain of R9ap functions as the membrane anchor
for the other largely soluble interacting partners. Hu et al. (2003)
determined that the formation of a membrane-bound complex with bovine
R9ap increased the GTPase-accelerating activity of Rgs9 by a factor of
4.

By single-cell RT-PCR and immunoprecipitation analysis, Cabrera-Vera et
al. (2004) detected Rgs9-2 and Gnb5 mRNA and protein complexes in rat
striatal cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons.
Introduction of bovine Rgs9 constructs through a patch pipette in these
cells showed that the RGS domain of Rgs9-2 modulated D2 dopamine
receptor (DRD2; 126450)-mediated inhibition of Cav2.2 (CACNA1B; 601012)
Ca(2+) channels. This modulation was blocked by the introduction of the
DEP-GGL domain of Rgs9-2. Rgs9 did not modulate the M2 muscarinic
receptor (CHRM2; 118493) linkage to Cav2.2 channels in the same cell.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (1999) determined that the RGS9 gene contains 19 exons and
spans more than 75 kb. The RGS9-1 transcript is derived from exons 1
through 17, and the RGS9-2 transcript is derived from exons 1 through
16, a short segment of exon 17, and exons 18 and 19. Exon 17 is
alternatively spliced in a cell-specific manner. Alternative splicing of
exon 6, resulting in a 9-bp insertion, occurs in some RGS9-1 and RGS9-2
variants.

Sierra et al. (2002) determined that the RGS9 gene contains 19 exons and
spans 91 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel and by FISH, Granneman et al.
(1998) mapped the RGS9 gene to chromosome 17q23-q24. Zhang et al. (1999)
confirmed this localization by somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nishiguchi et al. (2004) identified 4 unrelated Dutch patients with
bradyopsia (608415), each homozygous for a trp299-to-arg in the RGS9
gene (W299R; 604067.0001).

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in Rgs9 by homologous
recombination. The rod outer segment membranes from mice lacking Rgs9
hydrolyzed GTP more slowly than rod outer segment membranes from control
mice. The G-beta-5-L protein that forms a complex with Rgs9 was absent
from Rgs9 -/- retinas, although G-beta-5-L mRNA was still present. The
flash responses of Rgs9 -/- rods rose normally, but recovered much more
slowly than normal. Chen et al. (2000) concluded that Rgs9, probably in
a complex with G-beta-5-L, is essential for acceleration of hydrolysis
of GTP by the rod transducin alpha subunit (139330) and for normal
recovery of the photoresponse.

suppression (PERRS; 608415), Nishiguchi et al. (2004) identified a
homozygous T-to-C transition at cDNA nucleotide 895 of RGS9 that
resulted in a tryptophan-to-arginine substitution at codon 299 (W299R).
The segregation of the W299R allele in the 4 families was consistent
with its pathogenicity. The electrophysiologic findings of W299R
homozygotes were similar to those in rgs9 knockout mice. W299 is one of
the most highly conserved residues in the catalytic RGS domain among RGS
family members in species ranging from C. elegans to human. The
substitution of a hydrophobic tryptophan with a positively charged
arginine residue was expected to disrupt the hydrophobic interactions of
the RGS domain. Nishiguchi et al. (2004) expressed the domain with the
W299R mutation and evaluated its function. The mutant was much less
soluble than the corresponding wildtype domain, and its ability to
stimulate the GTPase activity of transducin (see 139340) was about
20-fold lower than that of the wildtype domain.

614942	TITLE *614942 PHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1; PGS1
;;PGP SYNTHASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PGS1 (EC 2.7.8.5) catalyzes the first committed step in cardiolipin (CL)
biosynthesis (Kawasaki et al., 1999).

CLONING

By searching a database for human ESTs encoding a protein similar to
yeast Pgs1, Kawasaki et al. (1999) identified PGS1. They cloned the
full-length hamster cDNA from a CHO cell library. The deduced 553-amino
acid hamster protein shares 30% identity with yeast Pgs1. Northern blot
analysis detected variable Pgs1 expression in mouse tissues, with
highest expression in testis, followed by liver and brain. Expression
was intermediate in skeletal muscle, heart, and lung, lowest in spleen,
and absent in kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Kawasaki et al. (1999) had previously developed a temperature-sensitive
CHO mutant defective in PGP synthase activity that exhibited reduced
cellular content of PG and CL and abnormal mitochondrial morphology and
function. They found that transfection of hamster Pgs1 restored PG and
CL synthesis and corrected mitochondrial defects in mutant CHO cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the PGS1 gene to chromosome 17q25.3 based on an
alignment of the PGS1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK M77859) with the genomic
sequence (GRCh37).

607986	TITLE *607986 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A14; S100A14
;;BCMP84
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

S100A14 is a member of a subfamily of proteins related by Ca(2+)-binding
motifs to the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding protein superfamily.

CLONING

By analyzing a human lung cancer cell line subtractive cDNA library,
Pietas et al. (2002) identified and characterized S100A14, which encodes
a deduced 104-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of
11,662 Da. It contains 2 EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding domains, a
myristoylation motif, a glycosylation site, and several potential
protein kinase phosphorylation sites. Pietas et al. (2002) also cloned
the mouse homolog. S100A14 shares 38% amino acid sequence identity with
human S100A13 (601989) and 97% similarity with mouse S100a14. Northern
blot analysis detected expression of an approximately 1.1-kb transcript
at highest levels in colon and at moderate levels in thymus, kidney,
liver, small intestine, and lung. Low expression of an approximately
1.35-kb transcript was detected in heart and no expression was seen in
brain, skeletal muscle, spleen, placenta, and peripheral blood
leukocytes. S100A14 was found to be overexpressed in ovary, breast, and
uterus tumors and underexpressed in kidney, rectum, and colon tumors.
Transfection experiments indicated localization to the cytoplasm,
particularly in the perinuclear region.

Using a proteomics approach to identify genes upregulated in breast
cancer, followed by database analysis and PCR of a breast carcinoma cell
line, Adam et al. (2003) cloned S100A14, which they called BCMP84.
BCMP84 expression in normal tissue was restricted to stratified squamous
epithelium of skin, cervix, and tonsil. Weak staining was seen in normal
breast ductal tissue, but strong immunoreactivity was detected in 10 of
58 (17%) breast cancer tissues. BCMP84 was expressed in the plasma
membrane of transiently transfected breast carcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Adam et al. (2003) found that BCMP84
interacted with nucleobindin (NUCB1; 601323).

GENE STRUCTURE

Pietas et al. (2002) determined that the S100A14 gene contains 4 exons.
Exon 1 is untranslated.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Pietas et al. (2002) mapped the
S100A14 gene to chromosome 1q21 in a cluster with at least 15 other S100
genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chen et al. (2009) identified 4 SNPs in the S100A14 gene that were in
linkage disequilibrium among Han Chinese individuals. One SNP, 461G-A
(dbSNP rs11548103) in the 5-prime untranslated region, was shown to
diminish a binding site for the transcription factor P53 (TP53; 191170),
and was associated with decreased expression of S100A14 in vitro and in
vivo. A study of S100A14 RNA levels in surgically removed normal
esophageal tissues showed that individuals with the 461GG genotype had
significantly higher S100A14 RNA levels compared to those with at least
one 461A allele. A case-control study of 1,021 Han Chinese patients with
squamous cell esophageal carcinoma (133239) and 1,253 control subjects
found a significant association between the 461A allele and increased
susceptibility to esophageal cancer among smokers (odds ratio of 2.01
and 2.10 for the 461GA or 461AA genotypes, respectively, compared to the
461GG genotype). Chen et al. (2009) suggested that S100A14 may function
as a cancer suppressor in the P53 pathway and play a role in esophageal
carcinogenesis.

610369	TITLE *610369 HEAT-SHOCK 70-KD PROTEIN 14; HSPA14
;;HSP70-LIKE 1; HSP70L1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing a human dendritic cell cDNA library, Wan et al. (2004)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding HSPA14, which they called HSP70L1.
The deduced 509-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
54.8 kD. It has an N-terminal ATPase domain and 2 potential
N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.1-kb
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest levels in testis,
spleen, and thymus. RT-PCR detected HSP70L1 expression in various cell
lines, with highest levels in immune cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Wan et al. (2004) transfected HeLa cells with HSP70L1 and found that
HSP70L1 expression was upregulated by heat stress, TNF-alpha (191160),
and phorbol esters. HSP70L1 interacted with human dendritic cells (DCs),
resulting in DC maturation and activation. Although HSP70L1 shared
common cell surface receptors with HSP70 (HSPA1A; 140550), including
TLR2 (603028) and TLR4 (603030), there were functional differences
between the 2 proteins. HSP70L1 and HSP70 stimulated DC secretion of the
proinflammatory cytokines IL1B (147720) and TNF-alpha at comparable
levels, but HSP70L1 was a more potent stimulator of IL12p70 (see
161560). HSP70L1 induced secretion of the chemokines MIP1A (CCL3;
182283), MIP1B (CCL4; 182284), and RANTES (CCL5; 187011) and expression
of the chemokine receptors CCR7 (600242) and CXCR4 (162643) more
potently than HSP70. In addition, HSP70L1, but not HSP70, could induce
IP10 (CXCL10; 147310) secretion.

Otto et al. (2005) found that MPP11 and HSP70L1 formed a complex in HeLa
cells, rat liver, and rabbit reticulate lysate. The 2 proteins coeluted
on cation and anion exchange columns, and sucrose density gradients
showed that they comigrated with polysomes and ribosomes. The 200-kD
dimeric ribosome-associated complex (RAC) formed by MPP11 and HSP70L1
was sensitive to salt treatment and could rescue growth defects in yeast
strains lacking functional RAC.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wan et al. (2004) mapped the HSPA14 gene
to chromosome 10p12.33.

615262	TITLE *615262 METHYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE 23; METTL23
;;CHROMOSOME 17 OPEN READING FRAME 95; C17ORF95
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor,
generally S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), to acceptor molecules,
including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and small metabolites. METTL23
belongs to a family of protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate
nonhistone proteins (Cloutier et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to METTL22 (615261),
Cloutier et al. (2013) identified METTL23. The deduced protein is made
up predominantly of a Rossmann fold of alternating beta strands and
alpha helices, with a conserved AdoMet-binding site near the N terminus.
Epitope-tagged METTL23 was predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic
membrane-like structures in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, Cloutier et
al. (2013) found that METTL23 expressed in HEK293 cells interacted with
HSPA5 (138120), tubulin (see 602529), and UGGT1 (605897). UGGT2 (605898)
and HSP90B1 (191175) were also detected in the immunoprecipitate.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the METTL23 gene to chromosome 17q25.1 based on an
alignment of the METTL23 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC033998) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610560	TITLE *610560 PROTEASE, SERINE, 36; PRSS36
;;POLYSERASE 2;;
POLYSERINE PROTEASE 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching human genomic databases with TMPRSS9 (610477) as query,
followed by PCR of liver RNA, Cal et al. (2005) cloned PRSS36, which
they called polyserase-2. The deduced 855-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 93 kD and contains 9 potential
N-glycosylation sites. PRSS36 contains a signal peptide, followed by a
propeptide domain, an active serine protease domain with the catalytic
his, asp, and ser residues, and 2 serine protease domains predicted to
be catalytically inactive. The first serine protease domain shares amino
acid identity of 40 to 42% with gamma-1 tryptase (TPSG1; 609341),
pancreasin (608018), matriptase (ST14; 606797), matriptase-2 (TMPRSS6;
609862), and polyserase-1 (TMPRSS9). Northern blot analysis detected a
5-kb transcript in fetal kidney and adult skeletal muscle, liver,
placenta, and heart. A 2.2-kb transcript was detected in placenta,
prostate, and colon and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and may be
produced by alternative splicing. Immunolocalization studies and Western
blot analysis indicated that PRSS36 is secreted as a glycosylated
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Cal et al. (2005) showed that purified recombinant PRSS36 constructs
lacking the prodomain hydrolyzed a variety of synthetic serine protease
substrates and that serine protease inhibitors inhibited these
activities. Activity of the first serine protease domain was higher than
that of the entire PRSS36 polyprotein.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cal et al. (2005) mapped the PRSS36 gene
to chromosome 16p11.2.

606692	TITLE *606692 TNF RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 7; TRAF7
;;RING FINGER AND WD REPEAT DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; RFWD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF; see 191160) receptor-associated factors,
such as TRAF7, are signal transducers for members of the TNF receptor
superfamily (see 191190). TRAFs are composed of an N-terminal
cysteine/histidine-rich region containing zinc RING and/or zinc finger
motifs; a coiled-coil (leucine zipper) motif; and a homologous region
that defines the TRAF family, the TRAF domain, which is involved in
self-association and receptor binding.

CLONING

Using an integrated approach comprising tandem affinity purification,
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, network analysis, and directed
functional perturbation studies with RNA interference (RNAi) to map the
TNF/NFKB (see 164011) pathway, Bouwmeester et al. (2004) identified
RFWD1, which they termed TRAF7, as an interactor with MEKK3 (MAP3K3;
602539). The predicted 670-amino acid protein has an N-terminal RING
finger domain, followed by a noncanonical TRAF domain, a coiled-coil
(CC) domain, and 7 C-terminal WD40 repeats.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Bouwmeester et al.
(2004) determined that the WD40 repeats of TRAF7 bind MEKK3, whereas
homodimerization of TRAF7 occurs through the central TRAF and CC
domains. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated TRAF7 localization in a
vesicular pattern in the cytosol in the presence or absence of MEKK3.
SDS-PAGE analysis suggested that MEKK3 phosphorylates sites in the
N-terminal region of TRAF7 and induces ubiquitination. In the presence
of E1 (UBE1; 314370) and E2 (see UBE2E2; 602163) activating and
conjugating enzymes, a TRAF7 fragment containing the RING domain was
ubiquitinated, indicating that TRAF7 may have E3 ubiquitin ligase (see
UBE3A; 601623) activity. Luciferase reporter and RNAi analysis
established that coexpression of wildtype TRAF7 and MEKK3 resulted in a
synergistic activation of NFKB and AP1 (165160). Bouwmeester et al.
(2004) proposed that TRAF7, in conjunction with MEKK3, might act like
TAK1 (MAP3K7; 602614) and TRAF6 (602355) in relaying signals, impinging
on the activation of JNK (601158) and p38 MAP kinases (see MAPK14;
600289), most likely by means of intermediate effectors.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RFWD1
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP SHGC-601344).

SALIVARY PROTEIN Pe, INCLUDED;;
PAROTID MIDDLE BAND PROTEIN, INCLUDED; Pm, INCLUDED;;

CON2, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION Azen and Maeda (1988) reviewed the proline-rich proteins (PRP) of
saliva, which are encoded by 6 closely linked loci on chromosome 12p.
The proteins fall into acidic and basic groups. The 2 genes that encode
acidic proteins are PRH1 (168730) and PRH2 (168790), and these genes
contain repeated sequences that have a cleavage site for the restriction
enzyme HaeIII. The PRH1 locus codes for the Pa, Db, and PIF proteins.
The PRH2 locus codes for the Pr protein. The 4 genes that encode basic
proline-rich proteins are PRB1, PRB2 (168810), PRB3 (168840), and PRB4
(180990), and these genes contain repeated sequences that have a
cleavage site for the restriction enzyme BstNI. The PRB1 locus encodes
the PmF, PmS, Pe, and Con2 proteins. The PRB2 locus encodes the Ps and
Con1 proteins. The PRB3 locus encodes the G1 protein. The PRB4 locus
encodes the Po protein.

In parotid saliva of a Japanese population, Ikemoto et al. (1977) found
2 phenotypes by electrophoresis in acid-urea starch gels. The protein
showing polymorphism was located in the zone between Pa and the protein
labeled Pb (for protein basic) and thus was termed the parotid middle
band protein (Pm). Inheritance was autosomal dominant. The frequency of
the Pm(+) allele was about 0.38 in Japanese.

Azen and Denniston (1980) showed linkage of Pm and Ps to the Pa-Pr-Db-G1
cluster. On the basis of weak linkage disequilibrium, Ps may be closer
to G1 and Db than to Pa or Pr. Azen and Denniston (1980) provided
evidence for close linkage to 5 other parotid salivary protein loci.

Yu et al. (1980) presented evidence for linkage between Pa and Pr and
between Pr and Db. No significant sex heterogeneity in recombination was
found. Significant sex heterogeneity of recombination between Pa and Db
was found, but the lod score for males did not reach the level usually
accepted as proof of linkage. Population studies suggested linkage
disequilibrium among the three loci. Kauffman et al. (1982) found a
single amino acid difference between PmF and PmS proteins when a portion
of their primary structure was compared. From somatic cell genetic
studies using a human genomic probe, Goodman et al. (1984) concluded
that the cluster of genes encoding proline-rich proteins is located on
chromosome 12 and possibly on 12p since it could be excluded from the
12cen-q24 segment. The human SPC (salivary protein complex) may extend
over a map length of about 15 cM; in comparison, the major
histocompatibility complex has a map length of about 1.8 cM. Against the
proposed genetic length of 15 cM is the conclusion of Maeda (1986) that
the 6 genes of the complex are contained in a 500-kb segment of DNA.
(One cM is approximately 1,000 kb.) (Pm consists of 2 proteins, a fast
and a slow electrophoretic form, called PmF and PmS, respectively.)

Azen and Yu (1984) defined another polymorphism in the proteins of
parotid saliva. Called Pe, it was typed after protein staining in
alkaline polyacrylamide slab gels. The Pe+ allele had a frequency of
about 0.76 in both whites and blacks. From randomly collected samples,
the Pe+ protein was most strongly associated with the Con1 and Ps
proteins, less strongly associated with Pr and Pa proteins, and not
significantly associated with PmF, PmS, PIF, Db, Con2, or G1 proteins.
If it is assumed that the strength of these associations is related in
part to map distance, then these data roughly fit the preferred linear
order of PRP genes as previously determined by family linkage studies:
Ps-Pa-Pr-Pm-G1-Db. Pe was linked to Pa with maximum lod score of 2.69 at
theta = 0.0.

In a full review of salivary proteins, Azen and Maeda (1988) stated that
the 6 genes encoding proline-rich proteins are in a 700-kb interval in
the following order: PRB2--(60 kb)--PRB1--(70 kb)--PRB4--(190
kb)--PRH2--(160 kb)--PRB3--(190 kb)--PRH1.

Kim et al. (1993) presented the nucleotide sequences of 4 members of the
6-member human salivary proline-rich protein family: PRB1 and PRB2,
which encode basic PRPs, and PRB3 and PRB4, which encode glycosylated
PRPs. Each gene is approximately 4 kb long and contains 4 exons, the
third of which is entirely composed of 63-bp tandem repeats and encodes
the proline-rich portion of the protein products. Exon 3 contains
different numbers of tandem repeats in the different PRB genes.
Variation in the numbers of these repeats is also responsible for length
variations in different alleles of the PRB genes.

Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the 6 PRP genes by Kim et al.
(1993) suggested that they probably evolved from a single ancestral gene
by 4 sequential gene duplications, leading to 6 genes that fall into 3
subsets, each consisting of 2 genes. During this evolutionary process,
multiple rearrangements in gene conversion events occurred mainly in the
region between the 3-prime end of IVS2 and the 3-prime end of exon 3.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Merberg et al. (1993) first detected megakaryocyte-stimulating factor
(MSF) in the urine of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation
during a period of acute thrombocytopenia. Subsequent cloning studies
demonstrated that this 20- to 25-kD urinary metabolite of MSF was an
N-terminal cysteine-rich polypeptide component derived from a larger,
highly glycosylated precursor protein of approximately 400 kD. The
smaller urinary metabolite was shown to stimulate growth in both pure
and mixed megakaryocyte colonies from bone marrow fibrin cultures. MSF
precursor is a multifunctional domain protein with polypeptide sequence
homologies to both serum adhesive glycoproteins and secretory mucins
(see 158370). Articular cartilage MSF precursor contains large (76 to 78
repeats) and small (6 to 8 repeats) mucin-like O-ringed
oligosaccharide-rich repeat domains flanked by cysteine-rich N- and
C-terminal domains that are homologous to the somatomedin B and
hemopexin domains of vitronectin (193190), respectively.

Schumacher et al.(1994) described superficial zone protein (SZP), an
approximately 345-kD proteoglycan specifically synthesized by
chondrocytes located at the surface of bovine articular cartilage, and
also by some synovial lining cells. They demonstrated that SZP is
secreted by superficial zone chondrocytes and not by chondrocytes from
other zones of articular cartilage. SZP contains both chondroitin
sulfate and keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. SZP is extensively
degraded by papain, trypsin (276000), and pronase, but limited pepsin
(see 169700) treatment decreases its molecular mass only to 315 kD. SZP
is predominantly found in the media of explant and cell cultures.

Flannery et al. (1999) used cDNA sequencing and homology analysis to
elucidate the complete amino acid composition for the superficial zone
protein from human and bovine cartilage. They established that human
cartilage SZP is homologous with the proteoglycan first described as the
precursor protein of a megakaryocyte-stimulating factor by Merberg et
al. (1993). The cDNA encodes a protein of 1,404 amino acids with a
somatomedin B homology domain, heparin-binding domains, multiple
mucin-like repeats, a hemopexin domain, and an aggregation domain. There
are 3 consensus sequences for N-glycosylation and 1 chondroitin sulfate
substitution site. Bovine SZP and human MSF precursor sequences are
about 75% identical at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels.

Using a positional cloning approach, Marcelino et al. (1999) identified
the MSF gene within the chromosome 1q25-q31 critical region for the
autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis
syndrome (CACP; 208250) locus. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that
a 4.5-kb MSF mRNA is expressed in several tissues, including liver,
lung, and heart, and is highly expressed in synovial tissue. A 30-kD
N-terminal MSF fragment was detectable in serum and urine.

By Northern blot analysis, Ikegawa et al. (2000) demonstrated limited
expression of the human PRG4 gene as 4.2- and 1.7-kb transcripts;
expression was strongest in liver, but was also observed in heart,
brain, and muscle. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated strong expression in
cartilage. RT-PCR also detected 4 types of alternative splicing. Type A
consisted of exons 1-6, type B of exons 1 and 3-5, type C of exons 1-3,
and type D of exons 1 and 3. Resultant deletions caused by skipping
these exons were all in-frame. Types A and B were expressed
ubiquitously; types C and D showed tissue-limited expression.

The cells of hematopoietic and vascular endothelial cell lineages are
believed to share a common precursor, termed the hemangioblast. Liu et
al. (2004) reported the identification of hemangiopoietin (HAPO), a
novel growth factor acting on both hematopoietic and endothelial cell
lineages. The cDNA clone encoding HAPO is an alternative splicing
variant lacking exon 5 of PRG4, as demonstrated by a comparative cDNA
sequence analysis of HAPO and PRG4. Liu et al. (2004) suggested that
HAPO may have a clinical potential in the treatment of various
cytopenias and radiation injury and in the expansion of hematopoietic
and endothelial stem/progenitor cells.

Jay et al. (2000) purified lubricin from pooled synovial fluid with
normal lubricating activity that was obtained from patients with
osteoarthritis. Purified lubricin has an apparent molecular mass of 280
kD by SDS-PAGE; deglycosylation decreased the apparent molecular mass to
120 kD. Sequencing revealed a 100% match with exons 6 to 9 of the MSF
gene. Lubricin exhibited boundary-lubricating activity similar to that
of whole synovial fluid. Jay et al. (2000) concluded that lubricin is
secreted by synovial fibroblasts. They stated that lubricin is the only
lubricating component in the final lubricating fraction of human
synovial fluid.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikegawa et al. (2000) determined that the human and mouse PRG4 genes
each contain 12 exons and that they span 18 and 16 kb, respectively.

MAPPING

Using a positional cloning approach, Marcelino et al. (1999) identified
the MSF gene within the chromosome 1q25-q31 critical region for the
autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis
syndrome (CACP; 208250) locus.

By FISH, Ikegawa et al. (2000) mapped the human PRG4 gene to chromosome
1q24-q25. By the same method they mapped the mouse mouse Prg4 gene to
chromosome 1G, in a region showing syntenic homology to human 1q24-q25.

GENE FUNCTION

Jay et al. (2007) used a multiple-particle-tracking microrheology
technique to study the molecular interaction between lubricin and
hyaluronic acid in bovine synovial fluid. They found that lubricin
affects the diffusive behavior of synovial fluid and contributes to the
elastic absorption and energy dissipation of synovial fluid at
physiologic shear frequencies. In studies involving synovial fluid from
a patient with camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis,
hyaluronic acid molecules adopted an extended and more rigid
conformation, suggesting that synovial fluid lacking lubricin would be
less able to dissipate the energy of impact that occurs during mammalian
locomotion. Jay et al. (2007) concluded that lubricin provides a
chondroprotective feature to synovial fluid that is distinct from the
role lubricin plays at the cartilage surface as a boundary lubricant.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Marcelino et al. (1999) identified 8 likely disease-causing mutations in
the MSF gene in patients with CACP from consanguineous families. Four
were homozygous deletions. Additionally, they detected a dinucleotide
transversion that created a nonsense codon, and a 41-bp insertion 14
nucleotides upstream of the intron 6 splice acceptor site that disrupted
the polypyrimidine tract of the splice site. Each of these mutations was
predicted to result in a truncated protein. Due to its high
glycosylation content and mucin-like repeats, Marcelino et al. (1999)
suggested that MSF may act as a joint/intimal cell lubricant. Both
synovial and pericardial cell hyperplasia may represent secondary
consequences of insufficient cell surface lubrication. Alternatively,
cell overgrowth may be primary to the pathogenesis of CACP.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rhee et al. (2005) generated Prg4 -/- mice, in which joints appeared
normal at birth; with aging there were abnormal protein deposits on the
cartilage surface, disappearance of underlying superficial zone
chondrocytes, and hyperplasia of intimal cells in the synovium. Purified
or recombinant lubricin inhibited the growth of those synoviocytes in
vitro. Tendon and tendon sheath involvement was present in the ankle
joints, with morphologic changes and abnormal calcification. Rhee et al.
(2005) concluded that lubricin has multiple functions in articulating
joints and tendons that include the protection of surfaces and control
of synovial cell growth.

;;SMALL CTD PHOSPHATASE 2; SCP2;;
CONSERVED GENE AMPLIFIED IN OSTEOSARCOMA 4; OS4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing genes within a region of chromosome 12 amplified in
sarcomas and brain tumors, Su et al. (1997) cloned CTDSP2, which they
designated OS4. The deduced 283-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 31.8 kD. Northern blot analysis detected expression in
all tissues examined, with highest expression in pancreas and lowest
expression in brain, lung, and liver.

Yeo et al. (2003) determined that the phosphatase domain of CTDSP2
shares more than 90% homology with the phosphatase domains of CTDSP1
(605323) and CTDSPL (608592).

GENE FUNCTION

Su et al. (1997) found that expression of CTDSP2 mRNA was enhanced in
several cancer cell lines with amplification of the CTDSP2 and CDK4
(123829) genes. CTDSP2 was also coamplified with CDK4 in 5 of 5 primary
sarcomas. Su et al. (1997) hypothesized that CTDSP2 may contribute to
the development of a subset of sarcomas.

Using the synthetic substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate in an in vitro
phosphatase assay, Yeo et al. (2003) determined that CTDSP2 has
phosphatase activity similar to that of SCP1, with Mg(2+)-dependent
activity and a pH optimum near 5.0.

Neuronal gene transcription is repressed in nonneuronal cells by the
repressor element-1 (RE1)-silencing transcription
factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF; 600571) complex.
To understand how this silencing is achieved, Yeo et al. (2005) examined
CTDSP1, CTDSP2, and CTDSPL, the small CTD phosphatases (SCP), whose
expression is restricted to nonneuronal tissues. Yeo et al. (2005)
showed that REST/NRSF recruits SCPs to neuronal genes that contain RE1
elements, leading to neuronal gene silencing in nonneuronal cells.
Phosphatase-inactive forms of SCP interfere with REST/NRSF function and
promote neuronal differentiation of P19 stem cells. Likewise, small
interfering RNA directed to the single Drosophila SCP unmasks neuronal
gene expression in S2 cells. Thus, Yeo et al. (2005) concluded that SCP
activity is an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulator that
acts globally to silence neuronal genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chang et al. (2008) showed that the CTDSP2 gene has 8 exons and that
intron 5 contains the microRNA MIRN26A2.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Su et al. (1997) mapped the CTDSP2 gene to
chromosome 12q13-q15, where it lies about 60 kb telomeric to the CDK4
gene.

603761	TITLE *603761 RAD9, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF, A; RAD9A
;;RAD9, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF; RAD9
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In S. pombe, rad9 is one of 6 genes essential for both the incomplete
DNA replication (S-M) and DNA damage checkpoints. See HUS1 (603760). By
searching an EST database, Lieberman et al. (1996) identified a partial
cDNA encoding HRAD9, a human rad9 homolog. The authors used the partial
cDNA to recover additional human RAD9 cDNAs corresponding to the entire
coding region. The predicted 391-amino acid human protein is 25%
identical to S. pombe rad9.

GENE FUNCTION

Lieberman et al. (1996) found that the human RAD9 gene partially
complemented the hydroxyurea sensitivity, radiosensitivity, and
checkpoint defects of rad9-null mutant cells.

On immunoblots of mammalian cell extracts, Volkmer and Karnitz (1999)
found that human RAD9 migrated at 70 kD, even though it has a predicted
molecular mass of 45 kD. The authors attributed this discrepancy to
complex posttranslational modifications. In vivo, the human RAD9 protein
was phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, suggesting that it
participates in a DNA damage-inducible signaling pathway.
Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the fully modified form of
RAD9 interacts selectively with RAD1 (603153) and HUS1 in a stable
complex. Volkmer and Karnitz (1999) concluded that these 3 proteins are
central components of a DNA damage-responsive protein complex in human
cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by analysis of somatic cell
hybrids, Lieberman et al. (1996) mapped the RAD9 gene to 11q13.1-q13.2.
They found that the 3-prime end of the RAD9 cDNA contains sequences from
the 3-prime untranslated region of PPP1CA (176875), indicating that the
2 genes are transcribed in opposite orientations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Maniwa et al. (2005) found that a functional human RAD9 protein
accumulated in the nuclei of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (211980)
cells. Maniwa et al. (2006) examined the RAD9 sequence in tumor and
peripheral normal lung tissues, and the expression of its mRNA using
RT-PCR. No sequence alterations were detected in the RAD9 gene, which
was found to be normally transcribed in surgically resected lung
carcinoma cells. However, in 8 (16%) cases a SNP was observed at the
second position of codon 239 (his/arg heterozygous variant) of the gene.
This frequency was significantly higher than that found in the normal
population.

603940	TITLE *603940 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY K, MEMBER 7; KCNK7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tandem pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, such
as TWIK1 (601745) and TREK (603219), contain 4 transmembrane domains and
2 pore-forming (P) domains. See KCNK6 (603939). By searching an EST
database for sequences related to mouse Kcnk6, Salinas et al. (1999)
isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel potassium channel, which they
designated KCNK7. RT-PCR revealed that exon skipping gives rise to 5
mRNA species encoding 3 protein forms, KCNK7-A, -B, and -C. The
predicted 307-amino acid KCNK7A form is the longest; KCNK7B and KCNK7C
have truncated cytoplasmic C termini. Sequence analysis revealed that
the KCNK7 protein contains 4 potential transmembrane segments and 2 P
domains. The P2 domain contains a very unconventional GLE motif instead
of the GLG found in TWIK1 and KCNK6 or the GFG found in other K2P
channels. The core region spanning the 4 transmembrane domains of KCNK7A
shares 80% and 42% protein sequence identity with those of Kcnk6 and
TWIK1, respectively. As with Kcnk6, none of the KCNK7 protein forms were
able to generate channel activity when expressed in mammalian cells.

MAPPING

By analysis of radiation hybrids, Salinas et al. (1999) mapped the KCNK7
gene to 11q13.

607309	TITLE *607309 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 1, MU-2 SUBUNIT; AP1M2
;;MU-1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP1M2 is a member of the medium chain family of the clathrin-associated
adaptor complex AP1. It is expressed exclusively in epithelial cells and
may mediate basolateral sorting of membrane proteins in polarized
epithelial cells.

CLONING

By EST database searching using mouse Ap1m1 (603535) as the query,
followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Ohno et al. (1999) cloned
a full-length cDNA encoding AP1M2, which they designated mu-1B. The
deduced 423-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 48 kD
and shares 97% sequence identity with the mouse Ap1m2 protein. Northern
blot analysis revealed expression restricted to placenta, lung, kidney,
pancreas, prostate, testis, small intestine, and colon. Dot blot
analysis revealed mRNA in stomach, pituitary gland, salivary gland, and
trachea. Northern blot analysis of cultured cell lines showed expression
restricted to most, but not all, polarized epithelial cells. In situ
hybridization on mouse embryos revealed highest levels of Ap1m2 mRNA
within intestinal mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, acinar cells of
the pancreas, epithelial cells of hair follicles, and secretory cells
(ameloblasts and odontoblasts) in developing teeth. In vivo
transcription/translation resulted in a protein with an apparent
molecular mass of about 47 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Ohno et al. (1999) determined that AP1M2
interacts with a subset of tyrosine-based sorting signals. Folsch et al.
(1999) noted that LLC-PK1 porcine kidney epithelial cells do not express
Ap1m2 and missort basolateral proteins, which are normally targeted
through a tyrosine-based sorting signal, to the apical surface. Stable
expression of AP1M2 selectively restored basolateral targeting, improved
the overall organization of LLC-PK1 monolayers, and had no effect on
apical targeting.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nakatsu et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Ap1m2 gene consists of
11 exons and spans approximately 21 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nakatsu et al. (1999) mapped the AP1M2 gene to chromosome
19p13.2. Using interspecific backcross analysis, they mapped the mouse
Ap1m2 gene to the proximal region of chromosome 9, which shows homology
of synteny to human 19p13.2.

602695	TITLE *602695 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR LIGAND SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 12; TNFSF12
;;TNF-RELATED WEAK INDUCER OF APOPTOSIS; TWEAK
TWEAK/APRIL SPLICED READ-THROUGH TRANSCRIPT, INCLUDED; TWEPRIL, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chicheportiche et al. (1997) isolated a novel tumor necrosis factor
(TNF; 191160) family member from mouse peritoneal macrophage mRNA. They
also cloned a homologous human cDNA encoding a predicted 249-amino acid
protein they called TWEAK. The TWEAK protein sequence contains the
single transmembrane domain common to TNF family members. Northern blot
analysis revealed that the 1.4-kb mRNA was expressed at varying levels
in many human tissues and cells.

- TWEAK/APRIL Spliced Read-Through Transcript

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK to exons 2 through 6 of APRIL (TNFSF13;
604472) using the splice donor/acceptor sites of TWEAK and APRIL mRNAs.
The deduced in-frame fusion protein, which the authors called TWEPRIL,
has a calculated molecular mass of 38 kD. TWEPRIL begins at the
initiation codon of TWEAK and contains the intracellular, transmembrane,
and stalk regions of TWEAK fused to the extracellular receptor-binding
domain of APRIL. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb TWEPRIL
transcript in resting and activated human primary T cells, in monocytic
cell lines, and in colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Transfected human
embryonic kidney cells expressed TWEPRIL as a 48-kD membrane protein.
TWEPRIL appeared to form SDS-stable aggregates that were likely trimers.
Western blot analysis revealed a 48-kD endogenous TWEPRIL protein in
human primary T cells and monocytic cell lines.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF12 gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Marsters et al. (1998) mapped
the APO3L gene to 17p13. Using the same technique, Chicheportiche et al.
(1997) refined the map position to 17p13.3.

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF12 gene lies 878 bp
upstream of the putative transcriptional start site of the TNFSF13 gene
on chromosome 17p13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Chicheportiche et al. (1997) found that expressed TWEAK protein was
secreted from cells, probably following proteolytic cleavage. TWEAK
could induce synthesis of IL8 (146930) from several cell types. Purified
TWEAK induced apoptotic death of HT29 cells cultured with human
interferon-gamma (147570).

Marsters et al. (1998) found that TNFSF12, which they called APO3L,
binds to the death domain-containing receptor DR3 (TNFRSF25; 603366).
They characterized the expression pattern of APO3L, as well as its
ability to induce apoptosis and NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activation in
human cell lines, and found that APO3L has overlapping signaling
functions with TNF, but displays a much wider tissue distribution.
Schneider et al. (1999), however, showed that soluble TWEAK induced
apoptosis of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line through the
autocrine/paracrine action of induced TNF and proposed that TWEAK used a
receptor distinct from TNFRSF25. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated
binding of TWEAK to a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, but Western blot and
RNase protection analyses failed to detect the presence of TNFRSF25 on
the cells.

Using flow cytometry and binding analyses, Kaptein et al. (2000) could
not detect binding of TWEAK or any other known TNF ligand to WSL1
(TNFRSF25). They observed that cells devoid of WSL1 or cells from
knockout mice lacking Wsl1 were TWEAK responsive.

Using techniques similar to those of Marsters et al. (1998), Wiley et
al. (2001) could not reproduce their results showing a TWEAK-APO3
interaction. Wiley et al. (2001) identified TWEAKR (TNFRSF12A; 605914),
a small protein with a cysteine-rich motif and a TRAF (see TRAF5;
602356)-binding site, as the TWEAK receptor. TWEAKR shares homology with
some TNFRs and is a fully functional member of the TNFR family. Blocking
of TWEAKR signaling inhibited the migration of renal microvascular cells
in vitro, indicating that endogenous TWEAK regulates endothelial cell
wound closure rates. Wiley et al. (2001) concluded that the TWEAK-TWEAKR
system plays a role in endothelial cell growth and migration.

Tian et al. (2004) demonstrated a direct interaction between TWEAK and
VG5Q (608464), a secreted angiogenic factor that is mutated in some
cases of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (149000).

Jain et al. (2009) analyzed circulating TWEAK levels in 56 patients with
heart failure and 14 age-matched controls, and found that circulating
TWEAK levels were differentially upregulated in patients with idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy (see CMD1A, 115200) compared to patients with
coronary artery disease (see CHDS1, 607339) or hypertension (145500) or
controls. Circulating TWEAK levels did not, however, correlate with
clinical functional parameters in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

- TWEAK/APRIL Spliced Read-Through Transcript

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that Jurkat human T cells and Ramos
human B cells cocultured with TWEPRIL-transfected 293T cells showed an
even greater increase in cell growth compared with controls than did
Jurkat human T cells cocultured with APRIL-transfected 293T cells. They
concluded that TWEPRIL is a membrane-bound protein that can induce
proliferation in a manner comparable with APRIL.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using transgenic or adenoviral-mediated gene expression in mice, Jain et
al. (2009) induced elevated circulating levels of TWEAK and observed the
development of dilated cardiomyopathy with subsequent severe cardiac
dysfunction. This phenotype was mediated exclusively by Tweakr,
independent of TNFA, and was associated with cardiomyocyte elongation
and cardiac fibrosis but not cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a bioinformatics analysis to reveal proteins related to Abraxas
(ABRA1; 611143), Wang et al. (2007) identified the KIAA0157 protein
(Nagase et al., 1995). The 415-amino acid protein, which Wang et al.
(2007) designated ABRO1 for 'Abraxas brother-1,' shares 39% identity to
ABRA1 in the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein (amino acids 1 to
260), including a coiled-coil domain and a region called the ABR domain.
However, ABRO1 lacks the phosphorylated ser-X-X-phe motif of ABRA1 and,
unlike ABRA1, does not bind to BRCA1 (113705).

MAPPING

By PCR of a panel of human-rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al.
(1995) mapped the FAM175B gene to chromosome 10.

EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3, SUBUNIT 1, FORMERLY; EIF3S1,
FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic initiation factor-3 (EIF3) has a molecular mass of about 600
kD and contains 13 nonidentical protein subunits, including EIF3J. EIF3
plays a central role in binding of initiator methionyl-tRNA and mRNA to
the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 40S initiation complex (Fraser et
al., 2004; Fraser et al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching an EST database with partial protein sequences of the human
eIF3-p35 and eIF3-p44 (EIF3G; 603913) subunits, Block et al. (1998)
isolated cDNAs encoding p35 and p44. The predicted p35 protein contains
258 amino acids. Both p44 and p35 coimmunoprecipitated with p170,
indicating that they are components of the eIF3 complex. Northern blot
analysis revealed that p35 is expressed as an approximately 2.4-kb mRNA
in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using insect cells to express EIF3 subunits and an in vitro binding
assay, Fraser et al. (2004) identified EIF3J as the EIF3 component
required for stable 40S binding. EIF3J promoted binding of a core
subcomplex made up of EIF3B (603917), EIF3G, and EIF3I (603911).
Purified EIF3 lacking EIF3J bound 40S ribosomal subunits weakly, but it
bound tightly when EIF3J was added. Cleavage of a 16-residue C-terminal
peptide from EIF3J by caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) reduced its affinity for
the 40S ribosomal subunit, and the cleaved form provided substantially
less stabilization of purified EIF3-40S complexes.

Fraser et al. (2007) found that EIF3J bound directly to the mRNA entry
channel and aminoacyl site of the 40S subunit, placing EIF3J directly in
the ribosomal decoding center. EIF3J also interacted with EIF3A (602039)
and reduced 40S subunit affinity for mRNA. High affinity for mRNA was
restored upon recruitment of initiator tRNA, even though EIF3J remained
in the mRNA-binding cleft in the presence of tRNA. Fraser et al. (2007)
concluded that EIF3J governs the binding of initiation factors and mRNA
to form the initiation complex.

607402	TITLE *607402 INTERFERON, LAMBDA-3; IFNL3
;;INTERLEUKIN 28B; IL28B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL28B is a class II cytokine receptor (e.g., IFNAR1; 107450) ligand
related to type I interferons (e.g., IFNA2; 147562). These ligands play
a critical role in response to microbial challenge and activate the JAK
(e.g., JAK1; 147795)/STAT (e.g., STAT1; 600555) signaling system
(Sheppard et al., 2003).

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sheppard et al. (2003) identified genes
encoding IL28A (607401), IL28B, and IL29 (607403). The deduced 200-amino
acid IL28B protein is 96% identical to IL28A and 81% identical to IL29,
but it shares only low homology with IL10 (124092), IFNA2, and IL22
(605330). IL28B has a conserved cysteine pattern and amphipathic profile
similar to other helical cytokine family members.

GENE FUNCTION

By RT-PCR analysis, Sheppard et al. (2003) determined that treatment of
mononuclear cells and other cell types with double-stranded RNA or viral
infection induced transcription of IL28 and IL29. Addition of IL28,
IL29, or IFNA2 also induced protection from virus challenge infection,
but IL28 and IL29 did not display antiproliferative activity. Luciferase
reporter analysis indicated that IL28 and IL29 signal through
IFN-stimulated response elements. However, IL28 and IL29 did not bind to
IFNAR1, but instead bound to and signaled through a novel receptor,
IL28RA (607404), partnered with IL10RB (123889). Sheppard et al. (2003)
proposed that IL28 and IL29 represent an evolutionary link between type
I IFNs and the IL10 family and may serve as an alternative therapeutic
choice to type I IFNs.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Sheppard et al. (2003) determined that the
IL28B gene contains 6 exons, in contrast to the related type I IFNs,
which are encoded by a single exon. Analysis of 5-prime regulatory
regions suggested the presence of DNA-binding elements involved in type
I IFN regulation.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sheppard et al. (2003) mapped the IL28A,
IL28B, and IL29 genes to chromosome 19q13.13, a localization distinct
from that of the related type I IFNs, which are colocalized on
chromosome 9.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Hepatitis C Virus Treatment Response

Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV; see 609532) affects 170
million people worldwide and is the leading cause of cirrhosis in North
America. The recommended treatment for chronic HCV infection involves a
48-week course of pegylated interferon-alpha-2b or -alpha-2a combined
with ribavirin (RBV). However, many patients are not cured by treatment,
and patients of European ancestry have a significantly higher
probability of being cured than patients of African ancestry. Ge et al.
(2009) performed a genomewide association study on more than 1,600
individuals chronically infected with HCV who were participating in a
clinical treatment trial. They identified a SNP 3 kb upstream of the
IL28B gene, dbSNP rs12979860, that was strongly associated with
sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as the absence of detectable
virus at the end of follow-up evaluation. The CC genotype of dbSNP
rs12979860 was associated with an approximately 2-fold greater rate of
SVR compared with the TT genotype, both among patients of European
ancestry (P of 1.06 x 10(-25)) and African Americans (P of 2.06 x
10(-3)). Because the CC genotype was substantially more frequent in
European than African populations, Ge et al. (2009) estimated that dbSNP
rs12979860 could explain approximately half of the difference in SVR
between African Americans and patients of European ancestry. They
sequenced the IL28B gene in 96 individuals and identified 2 variants
that were highly associated with dbSNP rs12979860: a G-C SNP 37 bp
upstream of the translation initiation codon (dbSNP rs28416183), and a
nonsynonymous coding SNP that produces a lys70-to-arg (K70R)
substitution (dbSNP rs8103142). Ge et al. (2009) could not resolve
which, if any, of these 3 SNPs was uniquely responsible for the
association with SVR and suggested that functional studies were needed.

To address the role of dbSNP rs12979860 in HCV clearance, Thomas et al.
(2009) genotyped 1,008 people from 6 independent HCV cohorts. The
frequency of the C allele was greater in individuals of European than
those of African ancestry in both HCV clearance (P of 3 x 10(-10)) and
persistence (P of 1 x 10(-21)) groups. However, the frequency of the C
allele versus the T allele was much greater in the clearance group in
both ethnic groups, with frequencies of 80.3% versus 66.7%,
respectively, in individuals of European ancestry (P of 7 x 10(-8)) and
56.2% versus 37%, respectively, in individuals of African ancestry (P of
1 x 10(-5)). Patients with the CC genotype were 3 times more likely to
clear HCV relative to patients with CT and TT genotypes combined (OR =
0.33, P = 10(-12) for combined ethnic groups), and the protective effect
of the C allele seemed to be recessive. The protective effect of the C
allele was independent of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B
virus surface antigen status, route of HCV acquisition, and other known
host genetic factors. Genotyping of populations worldwide showed that
the C allele was nearly fixed throughout east Asia, had an intermediate
frequency in Europe, and was a minor allele in Africa. The frequencies
in Central and South America were also intermediate, suggesting
selective pressure since migration from Asia. Thomas et al. (2009) noted
that dbSNP rs12979860 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with a
nonsynonymous coding SNP, dbSNP rs8103142, that could alter the function
of IL28B and explain the association, but that tests for functional
differences were needed to define the biologic mechanism. Thomas et al.
(2009) concluded that dbSNP rs12979860 is associated with both HCV
treatment response and with natural clearance of HCV.

To identify genetic variants associated with HCV treatment response,
Suppiah et al. (2009) conducted a genomewide association study of SVR to
PEG-IFN-alpha/RBV combination therapy in 293 Australian individuals with
genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C, with validation in an independent
replication cohort consisting of 555 individuals. They reported an
association to SVR with the SNP dbSNP rs8099917 (combined P = 9.25 x
10(-9), OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.57-2.52), within the gene region encoding
IL28B. IL28B contributes to viral resistance and is known to be
upregulated by interferons and by RNA virus infection. Suppiah et al.
(2009) concluded that their data suggested that host genetics may be
useful for the prediction of drug response, and also supported the
investigation of the role of IL28B in the treatment of HCV and in other
diseases treated with IFNA.

Tanaka et al. (2009) reported a genomewide association study to null
virologic response (NVR) in the treatment of patients with hepatitis C
virus genotype 1 within a Japanese population. Tanaka et al. (2009)
found 2 SNPs near the gene IL28B on chromosome 19 to be strongly
associated with NVR (dbSNP rs12980275, P = 1.93 x 10(-13), and dbSNP
rs8099917, P = 3.11 x 10(-15)). Tanaka et al. (2009) replicated these
associations in an independent cohort (combined P values, 2.84 x 10(-27)
(OR = 17.7; 95% CI = 10.0-31.3) and 2.68 x 10(-32) (OR = 27.1; 95% CI =
14.6-50.3), respectively). These SNPs were also associated with SVR
(dbSNP rs12980275, P = 3.99 x 10(-24), and dbSNP rs8099917, P = 1.11 x
10(-27)). In further fine mapping of the region, 7 SNPs located in the
IL28B region showed the most significant associations (P = 5.52 x
10(-28) to 2.68 x 10(-32); OR = 22.3-27.1). Real-time quantitative PCR
assays in peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed lower IL28B
expression levels in individuals carrying the minor alleles (P = 0.015).

614316	TITLE *614316 VTI1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, A; VTI1A
;;VTI1RP2
VTI1A/TCF7L2 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

VTI1A is a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment
protein (SNAP; see 603215) receptor (SNARE) that functions in the
transport of vesicles between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma
membrane (Flowerdew and Burgoyne, 2009).

CLONING

Xu et al. (1998) cloned mouse Vti1a, which they called Vti1rp2. The
deduced 217-amino acid protein has 4 putative coiled-coil regions and a
C-terminal transmembrane domain. The final coiled-coil region includes
an ATP/GTP-binding motif A (P loop). Northern blot analysis detected a
2.6-kb transcript in all mouse tissues examined except testis, which
expressed a 1.5-kb Vti1a transcript. Western blot analysis and
differential extraction of fractionated rat liver membranes revealed
that Vti1a was an integral Golgi membrane protein.

By immunohistochemical analysis of HeLa cells, Flowerdew and Burgoyne
(2009) found that human VTI1A showed a punctate vesicular distribution.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down assays, Xu et al. (1998) showed that mouse Vti1a
interacted with alpha-SNAP (NAPA; 603215). Coimmunoprecipitation
analysis revealed that Vti1a interacted with 2 distinct SNARE complexes
that contained either syntaxin-5 (STX5; 603189) or syntaxin-6 (STX6;
603944). Immunodepletion of Vti1a from Vero monkey kidney cells
interfered with plasma membrane trafficking of vesicular-stomatitis
virus G protein (VSVG), resulting in accumulation of VSVG in the Golgi
apparatus.

Flowerdew and Burgoyne (2009) showed that potassium channel-interacting
protein-1 (KCHIP1, or KCNIP1; 604660) interacted with the
channel-forming Kv4.2 potassium channel subunit (KCND2; 605410) and was
required for Kv4.2 trafficking to the plasma membrane. Using HeLa and
mouse Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells, they found that KCHIP1 and Kv4.2 used
an intracellular vesicle trafficking pathway that included VTI1A and
VAMP7 (300053) and required the GTPase RAB1 (179508), which is shared
with more conventional vesicle-trafficking pathways. Knockdown of VTI1A
or VAMP7 inhibited transport of Kv4.2 and KCHIP1 to the plasma membrane,
but it had no effect on membrane transport of VSVG.

CYTOGENETICS

- VTI1A/TCF7L2 Fusion Gene

Bass et al. (2011) reported whole-genome sequencing from 9 individuals
with colorectal cancer (114500), including primary colorectal tumors and
matched adjacent nontumor tissues, at an average of 30.7x and 31.9x
coverage, respectively. They identified an average of 75 somatic
rearrangements per tumor, including complex networks of translocations
between pairs of chromosomes. Eleven rearrangements encode predicted
in-frame fusion proteins, including a fusion of VTI1A and TCF7L2
(602278) found in 3 out of 97 colorectal cancers. Although TCF7L2
encodes TCF4, which cooperates with beta-catenin (116806) in colorectal
carcinogenesis, the fusion lacks the TCF4 beta-catenin-binding domain.
Bass et al. (2011) found a colorectal carcinoma cell line harboring the
fusion gene to be dependent on VTI1A-TCF7L2 for anchorage-independent
growth using RNA interference-mediated knockdown.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the VTI1A gene to chromosome 10q25.2 based on an
alignment of the VTI1A sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC017052) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY IVF, POLYPEPTIDE 8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By RT-PCR of human seminal vesicles using degenerate CYP4 primers as
probe, Bylund et al. (1999) cloned CYP4F8. The deduced 520-amino acid
protein has a heme-binding region and conserved heme ligand cys468.
CYP4F8 shares 81.2% and 76.7% amino acid identity with CYP4F2 (604426)
and CYP4F3 (601270), respectively. Northern blot analysis of human
seminal vesicles detected 2.1-kb and 2.3-kb transcripts.

By immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of a wide range of
tissues, Stark et al. (2003) localized CYP4F8 to human seminal vesicle
epithelium, epidermis, corneal epithelium, and proximal renal tubules.
Staining in healthy epidermis extended from the basal cell to granular
cell layers. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected 2.1-,
2.5-, and 5.8-kb transcripts in kidney and liver, and 2.1- and 2.5-kb
transcripts in seminal vesicles. RT-PCR analysis confirmed CYP4F8
expression in scalp hair roots. RT-PCR and immunohistochemical studies
showed increased CYP4F8 mRNA and protein expression in psoriatic lesions
compared to unaffected epidermis in 4 patients with psoriasis (see
177900).

By RT-PCR, immunohistochemical analysis, and in situ hybridization,
Stark et al. (2005) detected CYP4F8 expression in epithelial linings of
seminal vesicles and the ampulla of the vas deferens and in transitional
epithelium of the ureter and bladder. Immunofluorescence studies
colocalized CYP4F8 protein with PTGS2 (600262) in distal vas deferens
epithelium.

GENE FUNCTION

Using CYP4F8 expressed in yeast, Bylund et al. (2000) demonstrated that
CYP4F8 catalyzed omega-2-hydroxylation of prostaglandin H1 (PGH1) and
prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). CYP4F8 showed little activity against
prostaglandins D2, E1, E2, F2-alpha, and leukotriene B4. Stark et al.
(2005) showed that CYP4F8 metabolized prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) and a
stable analog of PGI2 to 19-hydroxyl compounds.

Stark et al. (2005) characterized CYP4F8 enzyme activity against
polyunsaturated long chain fatty acids. CYP4F8 catalyzed epioxidation of
docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3) and
omega-3-hydroxylation of 22:5n-6, the latter forming 20-hydroxy-22:5n-6
as the main product. Single amino acid substitutions in substrate
recognition site-1 (SRS1) and SRS4 of CYP4F8 affected oxygenation of
arachidonic acid but did not affect oxygenation of PGH2 analogs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bylund et al. (1999) determined that the CYP4F8 gene contains 13 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bylund et al. (1999) mapped the CYP4F8
gene to chromosome 19p13.1.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Caspases are cysteine proteases that play a central role in apoptosis.
Caspase-8 (FLICE; 601763) may be the first enzyme of the proteolytic
cascade that is activated by the FAS ligand (FASL; 134638) and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF; 191160). Caspase-8 is recruited to FAS (134637)
and TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1; 191190) through interaction of its prodomain
with the death effector domain (DED) of the receptor-associating protein
FADD (602457). By searching EST databases for sequences related to FADD,
Shu et al. (1997) identified cDNAs encoding a protein that they
designated CASPER. The predicted 480-amino acid CASPER protein contains
2 DED-like modules at its N terminus and a C-terminal caspase-like
protease domain. However, CASPER is not a caspase since it lacks several
conserved amino acids found in all identified caspases. Northern blot
analysis detected several CASPER transcripts, with highest expression in
human skeletal muscle, pancreas, and heart.

The viral FLICE inhibitory proteins (v-FLIPs) contain 2 DEDs and block
the early signaling events of the cellular death receptors. By searching
EST databases for cellular homologs of v-FLIPs, Irmler et al. (1997)
isolated human cDNAs encoding 2 isoforms of FLIP. FLIP(L), the longer
isoform, contains 2 DEDs and a caspase-like domain, and FLIP(S), the
shorter isoform, contains only the 2 DEDs followed by a C-terminal
extension of approximately 50 amino acids.

Goltsev et al. (1997), Han et al. (1997), Hu et al. (1997), Inohara et
al. (1997), and Srinivasula et al. (1997) isolated FLIP cDNAs; they
designated the gene CASH (caspase homolog), MRIT (MACH-related inducer
of toxicity; 'mrit' also means 'death' in Sanskrit), I-FLICE (inhibitor
of FLICE), CLARP (caspase-like apoptosis regulatory protein), and FLAME1
(FADD-like antiapoptotic molecule-1), respectively. Han et al. (1997)
cloned a cDNA encoding an MRIT isoform, which they called MRIT-alpha-2,
that lacks the first DED.

Irmler et al. (1997) and Goltsev et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs encoding
the mouse homolog of FLIP.

By microarray analysis, Jun et al. (2001) demonstrated expression of the
CFLAR gene in human donor corneas.

GENE FUNCTION

Shu et al. (1997) showed that CASPER interacted with FADD, caspase-8
(601763), caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636), TRAF1 (601711), and TRAF2 (601895)
through distinct domains. Overexpression of CASPER or its C-terminal
protease-like domain potently induced apoptosis, whereas a deletion
mutant lacking 45 C-terminal residues inhibited TNF- and FAS-induced
apoptosis. Since this truncated form is encoded by a natural splice
variant of CASPER, Shu et al. (1997) suggested that alternative splicing
of CASPER may provide a mechanism to regulate apoptosis triggered by
cell death pathways.

Irmler et al. (1997) found that activation of T cells induced a
transient resistance to FAS-induced apoptotic signals that correlated
with increased expression of FLIP(L). High levels of FLIP(L) protein
were detected in melanoma cell lines and malignant melanoma tumors. The
authors concluded that FLIP may be implicated in tissue homeostasis as
an important regulator of apoptosis.

Han et al. (1997) found that, when expressed in mammalian cells, MRIT
simultaneously and independently interacted with FLICE and BCLX(L)
(600039), an antiapoptotic member of the BCL2 family. Han et al. (1997)
suggested that MRIT may function as a link between cell survival and
cell death pathways in mammalian cells.

In human islets, elevated glucose concentrations impair beta-cell
proliferation and induce beta-cell apoptosis via upregulation of the FAS
receptor. Maedler et al. (2002) observed expression of FLIP in human
pancreatic beta-cells of nondiabetic individuals and decreased
expression in tissue sections of type 2 diabetic patients. In vitro
exposure of islets from nondiabetic organ donors to high glucose levels
decreased FLIP expression and increased the percentage of apoptotic
beta-cells, in which FLIP was no longer detectable. Upregulation of
FLIP, by incubation with transforming growth factor beta (TGFB1; 190180)
or by transfection with an expression vector coding for FLIP, protected
beta cells from glucose-induced apoptosis, restored beta-cell
proliferation, and improved beta-cell function. The beneficial effects
of FLIP overexpression were blocked by an antagonistic anti-FAS
antibody, indicating the dependence of these effects on FAS receptor
activation. The data provided evidence for expression of FLIP in the
human beta cell and suggested a novel approach to prevent and treat
diabetes by switching FAS signaling from apoptosis to proliferation.

The biologic outcome of TNF treatment is determined by the balance
between NF-kappa-B (see 164011), which promotes survival, and JNK (see
601158), which promotes cell death. Chang et al. (2006) found that Jnk
activity controlled Tnf-induced cell death through proteasomal
processing of Flip(L) in mice. Instead of direct phosphorylation of
Flip(L), Jnk promoted accelerated decay of Flip(L) through
phosphorylation and activation of the ubiquitin ligase Itch (606409).
Jnk1 or Itch deficiency or treatment with a Jnk inhibitor rendered mice
resistant in 3 distinct models of Tnf-induced liver failure, and cells
from these mice did not show inducible Flip(L) ubiquitination and
degradation. Chang et al. (2006) concluded that JNK antagonizes
NF-kappa-B during TNF signaling by promoting proteasomal elimination of
FLIP(L).

Oberst et al. (2011) showed that development of caspase-8-deficient mice
is completely rescued by ablation of receptor-interacting protein
kinase-3 (RIPK3; 605817). Adult animals lacking both caspase-8 and Ripk3
displayed a progressive lymphoaccumulative disease resembling that seen
with defects in Cd95 (FAS; 134637) or Cd95 ligand (FASL; 134638), and
resisted the lethal effects of Cd95 ligation in vivo. Oberst et al.
(2011) found that caspase-8 prevents RIPK3-dependent necrosis without
inducing apoptosis by functioning in a proteolytically active complex
with CFLAR and that this complex is required for the protective
function.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hadano et al. (2001) determined that the CFLAR gene contains 14 exons
and spans about 48 kb. It is transcribed in the centromere-to-telomere
direction.

MAPPING

Han et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization and
Srinivasula et al. (1997) used radiation hybrid mapping to localize the
FLIP gene to 2q33-q34. Based on sequence similarity to STSs, Irmler et
al. (1997) and Inohara et al. (1997) tentatively mapped the FLIP gene to
2q33. Irmler et al. (1997) noted that the FLIP gene colocalizes with
caspase-10 (CASP10; 601762) on 2q33, suggesting that these genes arose
by gene duplication. Hadano et al. (2001) determined that the CFLAR,
CASP10, and CASP8 (601763) genes are tandemly located within 200 kb.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yeh et al. (2000) observed that mice deficient in Cflar failed to
survive beyond embryonic day 10.5 and exhibited impaired heart
development, similar to mice lacking Fadd or Casp8. Unlike mice lacking
Fadd or Casp8, however, Cflar -/- embryonic fibroblasts were highly
sensitive to FASL- or TNF-induced apoptosis, showing rapid induction of
Casp3 and Casp8 activities. Both nuclear factor kappa-B and Jnk/Sapk
were activated in Cflar-deficient and wildtype cells in response to TNF.
Yeh et al. (2000) proposed that CFLAR cooperates with CASP8 and FADD
during embryonic development and regulates death factor-induced
apoptosis induced by FAS or TNFR1 engagement.

Huang et al. (2010) generated mice with conditional loss of Flip
expression in myeloid cells. These mice exhibited growth retardation,
premature death, and splenomegaly with extramedullary hematopoiesis.
They also showed increased circulating neutrophils with multiorgan
neutrophil infiltration. Monocytes were also increased, but macrophages
were reduced. In vitro, differentiation to macrophages was Flip
dependent. Huang et al. (2010) concluded that FLIP is necessary for
macrophage differentiation and homeostatic regulation of granulopoiesis.

613768	TITLE *613768 RING FINGER PROTEIN 213; RNF213
;;ALK LYMPHOMA OLIGOMERIZATION PARTNER ON CHROMOSOME 17; ALO17;;
KIAA1618
RNF213/ALK FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNF213 gene encodes a protein that possesses both ubiquitin ligase
activity and ATPase activity (Liu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned partial RNF213, which they
designated KIAA1618. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its
3-prime end, and the deduced protein contains 1,415 amino acids. RT-PCR
ELISA detected moderate RNF213 expression in all adult and fetal tissues
and adult brain regions examined except skeletal muscle, where RNF213
expression was low.

By database analysis and 5-prime RACE of the immature human myeloid
leukemia cell line K562, Cools et al. (2002) cloned 2 splice variants of
RNF213, which they called ALO17. The deduced proteins contain 1,599 and
1,550 amino acids. Both proteins contain a potential N-terminal zinc
finger motif, but they differ in the presence or absence of a sequence
near the N terminus.

Kamada et al. (2011) noted that full-length RNF213 contains 5,256 amino
acids and contains a RING finger domain, suggesting E3 ubiquitin ligase
function, as well as an HMG-CoA reductase degradation domain and an AAA
ATPase domain. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected strong RNF213
expression in adult human spleen and leukocytes, followed by placenta
and lymph node. Strong expression was detected in human fetal leukocytes
and thymus, with low expression in both adult and fetal human brain.
RNF213 expression was detected in both polymorphonuclear and mononuclear
cell fractions and in B and T cell fractions. There was low but
significant expression of RNF213 in human umbilical vein endothelial
cells and human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Cellular
expression of mouse Rnf213 was detected in the white pulp of the spleen,
primary lymph node follicles, and thymocytes in the medulla of the
thymus.

Liu et al. (2011) cloned RNF213 and found that their sequence included a
2,500-bp longer 3-prime untranslated region (UTR) compared to a
previously registered sequence and also lacked exon 4. Two splicing
variants differing by exclusion or inclusion of exon 4 were detected in
cDNAs isolated from various tissues. The short isoform, which skips exon
4, was the major variant and was detected in all tissues examined.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human-rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the
RNF213 gene to chromosome 17. Cools et al. (2002) mapped the RNF213 gene
to chromosome 17q25 by genomic sequence analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2011) found that transfection of RNF213 into HeLa cells
resulted in expression of the protein throughout the cytosol with
partial association with the intracellular membrane and cytoskeleton.
The E3 activity of the RING finger domain was confirmed by
self-ubiquitination after transfecting full-length RNF213 cDNA into
HEK293 cells. In addition, ATPase activity was detected in vitro by free
phosphate releasing analysis using a recombinant RNF213 fragment
including the Walker motif. Thus, RNF213 is a protein that possesses
both ubiquitin ligase activity and ATPase activity.

CYTOGENETICS

In a patient with ALK (105590)-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma,
Cools et al. (2002) identified a t(2;17)(p23;q25) rearrangement that
resulted in splicing of exons of the ALO17 gene from chromosome 17q25 to
exons of the ALK gene from chromosome 2p23. The predicted fusion protein
contains 1,172 N-terminal amino acids of ALO17 fused to 562 amino acids
of ALK, including the ALK kinase domain. FISH analysis confirmed the
presence of 2 copies of the AOL17-ALK fusion in the neoplastic cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By linkage analysis and genomewide association analysis of 63 Japanese
patients with moyamoya disease (MYMY2; 607151) and 45 controls, Kamada
et al. (2011) found a significant association between disease and a
variant in the RNF213 gene (R4859K; 613768.0001).

In affected members of 41 Japanese families and 1 Korean family with
moyamoya disease, Liu et al. (2011) identified an R4810K substitution
(dbSNP ss179362673) in the RNF213 gene (613768.0002). The variant
segregated with the disorder, although some carriers of the variant did
not have moyamoya disease, indicating incomplete penetrance. The
mutation was initially found by linkage analysis followed by exome
sequencing in eight 3-generation families. Haplotype analysis indicated
a founder effect. A case-control study of 251 East Asian patients and
707 controls showed a significant association between R4810K and the
disorder (odds ratio of 111.8, p = 10 x 10(-119)). In vitro functional
expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the R4810K protein was
expressed and localized normally within the cell, and had normal
ubiquitin activity. Direct sequencing identified 5 additional RNF213
variants in 7 of 64 East Asian cases, and 4 variants in 4 (8%) of 50
Caucasian cases (see, e.g., 613768.0003). Although these variants were
not found in controls, pathogenicity was difficult to prove. Liu et al.
(2011) postulated that variation in the RNF213 gene acts with
environmental factors to result in moyamoya disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Liu et al. (2011) demonstrated that knockout of the RNF213 homologs in
zebrafish caused abnormal vascular development, including abnormal
sprouting vessels particularly in the head region.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MOYAMOYA DISEASE 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
RNF213, ARG4859LYS

In Japanese patients with moyamoya disease (607151), Kamada et al.
(2011) found a significant association between disease and a 14576G-A
transition in exon 60 of the RNF213 gene, resulting in an arg4859-to-lys
(R4859K) substitution. In 19 of 20 families, heterozygosity for the
variant was found in 39 (92.9%) of 41 patients with the disorder and in
13 (46.4%) of 28 family members without the disorder. Three (7.1%)
patients had the variant in the homozygous state. The overall p value
among familial cases was 4.2 x 10(-7). None of 15 family members without
the variant developed the disease. The variant was also present in
heterozygosity and homozygosity in 45 (71.4%) and 1 (1.6%) of 63
Japanese patients with sporadic disease, respectively, and in 6 (1.4%)
of 429 controls. There was no phenotypic difference between homozygous
and heterozygous carriers. Overall, carrying the variant conferred an
odds ratio of 190.8 for development of the disorder (p = 1.2 x 10(-43)).
The R4859K variant was not found in 400 Caucasian controls.

Miyatake et al. (2012) found the 14576G-A transition in 39 (95.1%) of 41
Japanese patients with familial moyamoya disease, in 129 (79.2%) of 163
Japanese patients with sporadic moyamoya disease, and in 5 (1.8%) of 283
Japanese control individuals. Fifteen of the 168 patients with the
variant carried it in the homozygous state, whereas all 5 controls
carried it in the heterozygous state. Most patients inherited the allele
from either or both unaffected parents; all parents were heterozygous
for the variant. Miyatake et al. (2012) concluded that heterozygosity
for the 14576G-A variant confers an odds ratio of 236 for development of
the disorder. Patients with the 14576G-A variant had an earlier age at
onset (as early as age 4 years) and tended to have a higher frequency of
infarcts, posterior cerebral artery involvement, bilateral involvement,
seizures, and intellectual impairment compared to patients without the
variant. However, heterozygosity for the variant was also found in adult
patients. Comparisons of clinical features between 5 parent-offspring
pairs who were heterozygous for the variant showed anticipation.

Miyatake et al. (2012) reported a Japanese brother and sister who were
heterozygous and homozygous for the 14576G-A mutation, respectively. The
homozygous brother had onset of recurrent strokes in early childhood,
with deterioration in cognitive function and residual symptoms,
including paresis, headache, and visual loss, whereas the heterozygous
sister had only 1 stroke at age 17 years and no residual symptoms. Brain
imaging showed more severe vascular occlusion in the homozygous brother.
The findings suggested a dosage effect for this variant.

MOYAMOYA DISEASE 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
RNF213, ARG4810LYS

In affected members of 41 Japanese families and 1 Korean family with
moyamoya disease (607151), Liu et al. (2011) identified a G-to-A
transition in the RNF213 gene, resulting in an arg4810-to-lys (R4810K)
substitution (dbSNP ss179362673) in a conserved residue. The variant
segregated with the disorder, although some carriers of the variant did
not have moyamoya disease, indicating incomplete penetrance. The
mutation was initially found by linkage analysis followed by exome
sequencing in eight 3-generation families. Haplotype analysis indicated
a founder effect. A case-control study of 251 East Asian patients and
707 controls showed a significant association between R4810K and the
disorder (odds ratio of 111.8, p = 10 x 10(-19)). The variant was found
in about 1% of controls in East Asian populations, and some Japanese
controls were homozygous for the variant, arguing against a gene dosage
effect. Although R4810K was identified in 3 populations, the population
attributable risks in the Japanese (145/161; 90%) and Korean (30/38;
79%) populations were larger than that in the Chinese population (12/52;
23%). In addition, R4810K was not present among Caucasian cases or
controls. In vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed
that the R4810K protein was expressed and localized normally within the
cell; the variant protein also had normal ubiquitin activity. Knockout
of the homologs in zebrafish caused abnormal vascular development,
including abnormal sprouting vessels particularly in the head region.
Liu et al. (2011) postulated that variation in the RNF213 gene acts with
environmental factors to result in moyamoya disease.

MOYAMOYA DISEASE 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
RNF213, ASP4013ASN

In an affected Caucasian father of Czech descent and 3 of his children
with moyamoya disease (607151), Liu et al. (2011) identified a G-to-A
transition in the RNF213 gene, resulting in an asp4013-to-asn (D4013N)
substitution. The variant was not found in 384 Caucasian controls. The
father had a mild ischemic stroke at age 30 years, and his mother had
died of ischemic stroke at age 35. The 3 children developed moyamoya
disease at ages 5, 9, and 3 years. One had involuntary movements and
another had signs of ischemic stroke. Diagnosis of the disorder was
confirmed by brain MRI. The variant was relatively highly conserved,
especially in mammals. In vitro functional expression studies in HEK293
cells showed that the D4013N protein had normal ubiquitin activity.

601406	TITLE *601406 B-CELL CLL/LYMPHOMA 7A; BCL7A
;;B-CELL CLL/LYMPHOMA 7; BCL7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chromosome 12q24.1 is the site of a recurrent breakpoint in high-grade
B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (BNHL). To identify the gene(s) in the
12q24.1 region, Zani et al. (1996) performed molecular cloning of a
3-way translocation t(8;14;12)(q24.1;q32.3;q24.1) in a Burkitt lymphoma
cell line; all translocation breakpoints were cloned and sequenced.
Analysis of the der(12)(12;14)(q24.1;q32.3) breakpoint showed a CpG
island from 12q24.1 juxtaposed in a tail-to-tail configuration with a
productively rearranged V-D-J heavy chain gene. A total of 4.5 kb of
genomic DNA was shown to contain a potential 92-bp exon within the
centromeric boundary of the CpG island. This was used as a probe to
identify an RNA transcript of 3.8 kb expressed at low levels in a wide
variety of normal tissues. The longest open reading frame predicted a
serine-rich protein of 231 amino acids. This protein, designated BCL7A
by the authors, showed homology with the actin-binding protein caldesmon
(114213).

Jadayel et al. (1998) identified 2 genes, BCL7B (605846) and BCL7C
(605847), encoding proteins that share 90% identity with the N-terminal
51 amino acids of BCL7A as well as 41% identity in the same region with
Drosophila and C. elegans sequences. They suggested that the 3 genes are
members of an evolutionarily conserved gene family.

CYTOGENETICS

In the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Wein 133 containing a 3-way
translocation, Zani et al. (1996) found that the BCL7A breakpoint
occurred within the first intron and resulted in a free-of-fusion
transcript between MYC (190080) and BCL7A, with exon 1 of BCL7A being
replaced by MYC exon 1. The normal, untranslocated allele of BCL7A was
also expressed without mutation. Another BNHLs with 12q24.1 cytogenetic
abnormalities showed biallelic rearrangement within the first intron of
BCL7A, which was adjacent to the breakpoint observed in Wein 133. Zani
et al. (1996) concluded that disruption of the N terminus of BCL7A
defined a new mechanism in the pathogenesis of a subset of high-grade
BNHL.

MAPPING

The BCL7A gene maps to chromosome 12q24.1 (Zani et al., 1996).

604725	TITLE *604725 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 2; USP2
;;UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE, 41-KD; UBP41
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin (191339), a highly conserved protein involved in the
regulation of intracellular protein breakdown, cell cycle regulation,
and stress response, is released from degraded proteins by disassembly
of the polyubiquitin chains. The disassembly process is mediated by
ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs). Also see USP1 (603478).

CLONING

Using a double-screening method of bacteria expressing chick skeletal
muscle cDNA, Baek et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding a deduced
357-amino acid protein expressing deubiquitinating activity. Because
SDS-PAGE analysis indicated a 41-kD purified protein, the authors termed
the protein Ubp41.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the USP2
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP SHGC-132662).

131360	TITLE *131360 ENOLASE 2; ENO2
;;ENOLASE, GAMMA;;
ENOLASE, NEURON-SPECIFIC; NSE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The enolases (phosphopyruvate hydratase; EC 4.2.1.11) catalyze the
interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the
glycolytic pathway. The functional enzyme is a dimer made up of subunits
referred to as alpha, beta, and gamma. In mammals there are at least 3
isoforms of enolase characterized by different tissue distributions as
well as by distinct biochemical and immunologic properties. The gamma-,
or neuron-specific, enolase (ENO2) is the major form found in mature
neurons and in cells of neuronal origin. The alpha-, or nonneuronal,
enolase (ENO1; 172430) is a nearly ubiquitous form, found in almost all
tissues, and its expression precedes that of the other isoforms in the
early stage of embryonic development. The beta-, or muscle-specific,
enolase (ENO3; 131370) is present in adult skeletal muscle (summary by
Oliva et al., 1991).

GENE FUNCTION

Muller et al. (2012) proposed that homozygous deletions in passenger
genes in cancer deletions can expose cancer-specific therapeutic
vulnerabilities when the collaterally deleted gene is a member of a
functionally redundant family of genes carrying out an essential
function. The glycolytic gene ENO1 in the 1p36 locus is deleted in
glioblastoma, which is tolerated by the expression of ENO2. Muller et
al. (2012) showed that short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of ENO2
selectively inhibits growth, survival, and the tumorigenic potential of
ENO1-deleted GBM cells, and that the enolase inhibitor
phosphonoacetohydroxamate is selectively toxic to ENO1-deleted GBM cells
relative to ENO1-intact GBM cells or normal astrocytes. Muller et al.
(2012) suggested that the principle of collateral vulnerability should
be applicable to other passenger-deleted genes encoding functionally
redundant essential activities and provide an effective treatment
strategy for cancers containing such genomic events.

MAPPING

Enolase-2 is determined by a gene on chromosome 12 (Grzeschik, 1976).
Herbschleb-Voogt et al. (1978) confirmed assignment to chromosome 12 by
showing synteny with LDHB and PEPB in man-mouse hybrids. Mattei et al.
(1982) assigned ENO2 to 12p11-qter by study of cells trisomic for
12pter-p11. Law and Kao (1982) also assigned the gene to chromosome 12.
By in situ hybridization, Craig et al. (1989, 1990) localized ENO2 to
12p13. Oliva et al. (1991) demonstrated that the ENO2 gene contains 12
exons distributed over 9,213 nucleotides. The putative promoter region
lacks canonical TATA and CAAT boxes, is very G+C-rich, and contains
several potential regulatory sequences.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chow and Lee (1996) reported the cDNA sequence of DENN, a novel human
gene that is differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells
(hence, the symbol DENN). Northern blot analysis revealed differential
levels of expression of a 6.5-kb DENN transcript in malignant cell lines
compared to normal human tissues, where expression was highest in fetal
brain and kidney and in adult testis, ovary, brain, and heart. In fetal
liver and in several human cancer cell lines, the authors identified
cDNAs representing alternative transcripts of DENN that harbor a
deletion of 129 bp encoding 43 amino acids. Present within the serine-
and leucine-rich DENN gene product is an arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid
(RGD) cellular adhesion motif and a leucine zipper-like motif.

Using the yeast interaction trap system to identify proteins that
interact with the death domain of the type-1 tumor necrosis factor
receptor (TNFR1; 191190), Schievella et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs
encoding 'MAP kinase-activating death domain' (MADD) protein.
Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitated proteins from various human cell
lines detected an approximately 200-kD MADD protein. The deduced
1,588-amino acid MADD protein contains a C-terminal death domain.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned KIAA0358. The deduced protein
contains 1,581 amino acids and is nearly identical to DENN.

Chow et al. (1998) stated that the DENN and MADD cDNAs and proteins are
virtually identical. From genomic studies, they traced the alternative
splicing of a 129-bp fragment to an alternative 5-prime donor site
involving exon 7. The deduced longer DENN isoform has 1,587 amino acids.
Western blot analysis of human MOLT-4 T-lymphoblastic leukemic cell
proteins detected a doublet consisting of 138- and 142-kD polypeptides.
The authors found the DENN protein concentrated predominantly in the
cytosolic compartment of MOLT-4 cells but was restricted to the nuclear
compartment of PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cells.

Efimova et al. (2004) identified 7 putative splice variants of MADD:
IG20 full-length (IG20FL), IG20, KIAA0358, MADD (also referred to as
DENN), IG20 short variant-2 (IG20SV2), DENNSV (also referred to as
IG20SV3), and IG20SV4. These variants arise from alternative splicing of
exons 13L, 16, 21, 26, and 34. IG20FL, the longest variant, is encoded
by all 36 exons of the MADD gene. RT-PCR detected variable expression of
IG20, MADD, IG20SV, and DENNSV in all human tissues examined. Expression
of KIAA0358, IG20FL, and IG20SV4 was not observed.

GENE FUNCTION

Schievella et al. (1997) found that the MADD protein associated with
TNFR1 through a death domain-death domain interaction. Overexpression of
MADD activated the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK2 (176948),
and expression of the MADD death domain stimulated both the ERK2 and
JNK1 (601158) MAP kinases and induced the phosphorylation of cytosolic
phospholipase A2 (600522). The authors suggested that MADD links TNFR1
with MAP kinase activation and arachidonic acid release.

Al-Zoubi et al. (2001) showed that HeLa cells permanently transfected
with IG20 or DENNSV were more susceptible or resistant to TNF-alpha
(TNFA; 191160)-induced apoptosis, respectively. All MADD variants tested
could interact with TNFR1 and activate ERK and NF-kappa-B (see 164011).
However, relative to control cells, only those expressing IG20 showed
enhanced TNF-alpha-induced activation of caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763) and
CASP3 (600636). Cowpox virus CrmA, an inhibitor of caspase-induced
apoptosis, inhibited apoptosis when transfected in IG20-expressing HeLa
cells.

Using specific small hairpin RNAs targeted to splice variants of the
MADD gene, Mulherkar et al. (2006) found that knockdown of the MADD
variant resulted in spontaneous apoptosis in HeLa cells and in a human
ovarian carcinoma cell line, and they demonstrated that the MADD variant
alone was necessary and sufficient for cancer cell survival. Mulherkar
et al. (2006) hypothesized that since the MADD variant can bind to death
receptors, it may prevent apoptotic signaling by interfering with death
receptor oligomerization.

Efimova et al. (2004) found that overexpression of DENNSV enhanced cell
replication and resistance to treatment with proapoptotic stimuli. In
contrast, IG20 expression suppressed cell replication and increased
susceptibility to proapoptotic stimuli. Moreover, cells that were
resistant or susceptible to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis exclusively
expressed endogenous DENNSV and IG20, respectively. Transfection of IG20
in a DENNSV-expressing cell line overrode endogenous DENNSV function and
increased susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli. Dominant-negative
I-kappa-B (see NFKBIA; 164008) reversed the effects of DENNSV, but not
IG20, indicating that DENNSV functions through NF-kappa-B activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chow et al. (1998) determined that the MADD gene spans at least 28 kb
and contains 15 exons, ranging in size from 73 to 1,230 bp.

Efimova et al. (2004) determined that the MADD gene contains 36 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the MADD gene
to chromosome 11. Using FISH, Chow et al. (1998) mapped the MADD gene to
chromosome 11p11.2.

;;PLASMA MEMBRANE Ca(2+)-ATPase, TYPE 4; PMCA4;;
ATP2B2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Ca(2+)-ATPases are a family of plasma membrane pumps encoded by at
least 4 genes: ATP2B1 (108731) on chromosome 12q21; ATP2B2 (108733) on
3q26; ATP2B3 (300014) on Xq28; and ATP2B4.

CLONING

By PCR, Brandt et al. (1992) detected expression of the PMCA4a variant
in all tissues examined. They identified a second variant, PMCA4b, that
was primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, small intestine, heart,
spinal cord, and brain. Brandt et al. (1992) isolated the full-length
PMCA4b cDNA from a fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced 473-amino acid
protein lacks a large portion of the C terminus found in PMCA4a.

By RT-PCR, Santiago-Garcia et al. (1996) found variable expression of
the PMCA and SERCA (see 108730) genes during human fetal heart
development. PMCA4 and PMCA1 were expressed in 8-, 12-, and 20-week
fetal heart and in adult heart. Two PMCA4 splice variants were detected
in heart tissue, whereas only 1 was detected in placenta.

Okunade et al. (2004) examined Pmca1 and Pmca4 expression in mouse
tissues. Pmca1 was expressed in all tissues examined, and Pmca4 was
expressed in all tissues examined except liver. Pmca1 predominated in
brain, intestine, kidney, lung, and stomach, whereas Pmca4 predominated
in aorta, portal vein, bladder, diaphragm, seminal vesicles, and testis.
Immunostaining localized Pmca4 to the principal piece of the sperm tail,
the location of Catsper (606389), the major Ca(2+) channel required for
sperm motility.

MAPPING

Olson et al. (1991) mapped the PMCA4 gene to chromosome 1q25-q32 by
Southern analysis of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, in situ
hybridization of human metaphase spreads, and genetic linkage analysis
in the CEPH pedigrees. No evidence was obtained for multiple copies of
the gene at this locus; however, a cross-hybridizing sequence was
detected on Xq13-qter at low stringency.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Associations Pending Confirmation

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the ATP2B4
gene and resistance to severe malaria, see 611162.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2004) expressed mouse Cd22 (107266) in mouse and chicken
B-cell lines devoid of Cd22 and examined B cells from mice deficient in
Cd22 or Pmca4. They identified an activation-dependent interaction
between phosphorylated Cd22 and Pmca4 and found that Cd22 together with
Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883) provided negative control of B-cell activation by
enhancing Pmca4-mediated calcium efflux after B-cell receptor
stimulation.

Okunade et al. (2004) found that loss of both copies of the mouse Pmca4
gene resulted in no overt phenotype. Loss of Pmca4 impaired phasic
contractions and caused apoptosis in portal vein smooth muscle in vitro,
but this phenotype was dependent on the mouse strain employed. On a
Black Swiss background, the phenotype was not expressed unless the mice
also carried a null mutation in 1 copy of the Pmca1 gene. Pmca4 -/- male
mice were infertile but had normal spermatogenesis and mating behavior.
Pmca4 -/- sperm that had not undergone capacitation exhibited normal
motility but did not achieve hyperactivated motility needed to traverse
the female genital tract. Ultrastructure of the motility apparatus of
mutant sperm tails showed mitochondrial condensation, indicating Ca(2+)
overload. Okunade et al. (2004) concluded that PMCA4 expression in the
principal piece of sperm tail is essential for hyperactivated motility
and male fertility.

609405	TITLE *609405 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 8; ARHGAP8
;;GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RHO, 8;;
BCH DOMAIN-CONTAINING, PROLINE-RICH, AND CDC42GAP-LIKE PROTEIN 1;
BPGAP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small GTPases control cell dynamics during growth and development.
Proteins with a GTPase-activating domain (GAP) domain, such as ARHGAP8,
catalyze the conversion of small GTPases from their active, GTP-bound
form to their inactive, GDP-bound form (Lua and Low, 2004).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to CDC42GAP (ARHGAP1;
602732), followed by PCR of a mammary carcinoma cell line, Shang et al.
(2003) cloned a splice variant of ARHGAP8, which they designated BPGAP1.
The deduced 433-amino acid protein contains a BNIP2 (603292) and
CDC42GAP homology (BCH) domain, followed by a proline-rich region and a
C-terminal GAP domain with a conserved arginine necessary for catalytic
activity. Database analysis identified 3 possible splice variants
encoding BPGAP1-like proteins that differ in their N-terminal halves.
RT-PCR detected expression of BPGAP1 in all human cell lines and mouse
tissues tested.

Using a candidate gene approach to identify putative tumor suppressors
in a region of chromosome 22 involved in loss of heterozygosity,
Johnstone et al. (2004) identified the ARHGAP8 gene. They characterized
3 different ARHGAP8 transcripts resulting from alternative splicing of
exon 5. The variant containing exon 5 encodes a deduced 464-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 53.5 kD. This isoform
contains a putative N-terminal BCH lipid-binding domain, a central
proline-rich SH3 domain-binding motif, and a C-terminal RhoGAP domain
with a conserved catalytic arginine. The variant lacking exon 5 encodes
a protein with a 31-amino acids deletion in the BCH domain, and the
variant with a truncation of exon 5 encodes a protein with a 5-amino
acid deletion in the BCH domain. Northern blot analysis detected ARHGAP8
expression in colon, skeletal muscle, small intestine, stomach, and
testis, with highest expression in kidney and placenta. Johnstone et al.
(2004) also identified mouse Arhgap8. The mouse gene lacks an exon
equivalent to human exon 5 and encodes a 325-amino acid protein that
shares 80% identity with human ARHGAP8. Johnstone et al. (2004) noted
that a mouse gene reported as Arhgap8 by Shan et al. (2003) actually
represents a distinct gene, Prr5 (609406), located immediately
centromeric to Arhgap8.

GENE FUNCTION

Shang et al. (2003) found that BPGAP1 selectively enhanced RhoA (ARHA;
165390) GTPase activity in vitro, although it also interacted strongly
with CDC42 (116952) and RAC1 (602048). Pull-down and
coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that BPGAP1 formed homophilic and
heterophilic complexes with other BCH domain-containing proteins.
Epitope-tagged BPGAP1 induced pseudopodia and increased cell mobility in
a transfected breast cancer cell line. Formation of pseudopodia required
the BCH and GAP domains of BPGAP1, but not the proline-rich region.
BPGAP1-induced pseudopodia formation was differentially inhibited by
coexpression of a constitutively active RhoA mutant or by
dominant-negative mutants of CDC42 and RAC1. A BPGAP1 mutant without the
proline-rich region failed to increase cell migration despite the
induction of pseudopodia.

By protein precipitations and matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, Lua and Low (2004) found that
BPGAP1 interacted directly with cortactin (EMS1; 164765) in several
human cell lines. Progressive deletion studies indicated that the SH3
domain of cortactin interacted directly with the proline-rich motif at
amino acids 182 to 189 of BPGAP1. Cotransfection of human embryonic 293T
cells with cortactin and BPGAP1 resulted in colocalization of the 2
proteins at the cell periphery and enhanced cell migration. Substitution
of pro184 and pro186 in BPGAP1 with alanines abolished the interaction,
and mutant BPGAP1 failed to facilitate translocation of cortactin to the
periphery or enhance cell migration.

GENE STRUCTURE

Johnstone et al. (2004) determined that the ARHGAP8 gene contains 13
exons and spans 110 kb. Exon 1 is embedded in a CpG island.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Johnstone et al. (2004) mapped the ARHGAP8
gene to chromosome 22q13.31, immediately centromeric to the PRR5 gene.
They mapped the mouse Arhgap8 gene to chromosome 15E2, a region that
shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 22q13.

;;LEFT-RIGHT DETERMINATION, FACTOR B; LEFTY B;;
LEFTY1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
LEFTB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vertebrates exhibit numerous left-right (L-R) asymmetries, such as the
position of the heart and spleen on the left side. L-R polarity is
determined early during development, around the presomite stage in
mammals. Several genes have been shown to be expressed asymmetrically
relative to the L-R axis. Meno et al. (1996, 1997) identified 2
transforming growth factor-beta-related genes, Lefty1 and Lefty2
(601887), that are expressed on the left side of developing mouse
embryos. A human sequence corresponding to the mouse Lefty2 gene has
been deposited in the GenBank database (GENBANK AF081507).

Kosaki et al. (1999) characterized 2 homologs of the murine Lefty1 and
Lefty2 genes, which they designated LEFTY B and LEFTY A, respectively.
Both genes encode proteins with 366 amino acids. The deduced amino acid
sequences of LEFTY B and LEFTY A are more similar to each other than to
mouse Lefty1 or Lefty2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kosaki et al. (1999) determined that the LEFTY1 and LEFTY2 genes each
comprise 4 exons spliced at identical positions. The genes are separated
by approximately 50 kb on chromosome 1q42.

MAPPING

Kosaki et al. (1999) mapped the LEFTY1 and LEFTY2 genes to chromosome
1q42 by FISH.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of LEFTY2 and the mutations identified in that gene in
cases of left-right axis malformations, see 601877.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lefty1, Lefty2, and Nodal (601265) are expressed on the left side of
developing mouse embryos and are implicated in L-R determination. Meno
et al. (1998) examined the role of Lefty1 by analyzing mutant mice
lacking this gene. The Lefty1-deficient mice showed a variety of L-R
positional defects in visceral organs. The most common feature of Lefty1
-/- mice was thoracic left isomerism (rather than right isomerism). The
lack of Lefty1 resulted in bilateral expression of Nodal, Lefty2, and
Pitx2 (601542), a homeobox gene normally expressed on the left side.
These observations suggested that the role of Lefty1 is to restrict the
expression of Lefty2 and Nodal to the left side, and that Lefty2 or
Nodal encode a signal for 'leftness.'

In mouse embryos, Takaoka et al. (2006) found that Lefty1 was
asymmetrically expressed in the primitive endoderm of the implanting
blastocyst. Lefty1 expression began randomly in the inner cell mass of
the blastocyst but became regionalized to one side of the tilted inner
cell mass shortly after implantation. Asymmetric Lefty1 expression was
established by in vitro culture, indicating that it does not require
interaction with the uterus. Asymmetric Lefty1 expression was induced by
Nodal signaling, although Nodal and genes for its effectors were
expressed symmetrically. Takaoka et al. (2006) concluded that asymmetric
patterning of the mouse embryo along the anteroposterior axis begins in
the periimplantation stage.

Reaction-diffusion models postulated that differences in signaling range
are caused by differential diffusivity of inhibitor and activator. Other
models suggested that differential clearance underlies different
signaling ranges. To test these models, Muller et al. (2012) measured
the biophysical properties of the Nodal/Lefty activator/inhibitor system
during zebrafish embryogenesis. Analysis of Nodal and Lefty gradients
revealed that Nodals have a shorter range than Lefty proteins.
Pulse-labeling analysis indicated that Nodals and Leftys have similar
clearance kinetics, whereas fluorescence recovery assays revealed that
Leftys have a higher effective diffusion coefficient than Nodals. Muller
et al. (2012) concluded that their results indicated that differential
diffusivity is the major determinant of the differences in Nodal/Lefty
range and provided biophysical support for reaction-diffusion models of
activator/inhibitor-mediated patterning.

191340	TITLE *191340 UBIQUITIN C; UBC
;;POLYUBIQUITIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Studies of ubiquitin cDNAs and genes show 2 unusual gene structural
arrangements (Schlesinger and Bond, 1987). The first type of arrangement
is the polyubiquitin gene, consisting of tandem repeats of a ubiquitin
coding unit, with the number of repeats varying considerably even within
species. Presumably posttranslational cleavage produces ubiquitin
monomers from the primary translation product. The second structural
type is the ubiquitin fusion gene, which encodes a single ubiquitin
moiety fused to an unrelated tail protein. Three types of ubiquitin have
been identified: A, B (191339), and C. The ubiquitin C (UBC) mRNA
corresponds to a 9-coding-unit polyubiquitin gene.

MAPPING

During Northern blot analysis of ubiquitin mRNA, Baker and Board (1989)
observed a UBC mRNA length polymorphism. They characterized this 'mRLP',
showed that it correlated precisely with an HaeIII RFLP, and explained
the origin of the polymorphism on the basis of unequal crossover events.
Using a 5-prime flanking fragment to probe Southern blots of DNA
obtained from somatic cell hybrid cell lines, Board et al. (1992)
determined that the UBC gene is located on chromosome 12. In situ
hybridization with the same probe refined the assignment to 12q24.3.

602327	TITLE *602327 PLECKSTRIN AND SEC7 DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN; PSD
;;TYL;;
EXCHANGE FACTOR FOR ARF6; EFA6;;
EFA6A
DESCRIPTION Perletti et al. (1997) identified a novel human gene on 10q24,
contiguous to the 3-prime end of the NFKB2 gene (164012) in a
tail-to-tail arrangement. They described a cDNA of 4,307 bp, isolated
from an adult human brain cDNA library, which contains an open reading
frame encoding a putative protein of 645 amino acids with a predicted
molecular weight of 71 kD. Database homology searches indicated that the
novel gene codes for a putative protein containing 2 discrete domains
with significant homology to the Sec7 and pleckstrin-homology (PH)
domains, respectively. They used the gene symbol PSD for
'pleckstrin-Sec7 domains.' Northern blot analysis of a panel of RNAs
from normal human tissues using the PSD cDNA as probe revealed the
presence of 3 different tissue-specific transcripts of approximately
4.3, 2.3, and 1.8 kb, the longest of which was expressed only in brain.
The data suggested that the PSD gene may encode a protein related to the
protein family containing both the Sec7 in the PH domains and thought to
be involved in signaling transduction processes. Other human proteins in
the same family include cytohesin-1 (Kolanus et al., 1996) and ARNO
(602488) (Chardin et al., 1996).

Derrien et al. (2002) reported that PSD, which they called EFA6A, is 63%
identical to EFA6B (PSD4; 614442) and contains a Sec7 domain adjacent to
a PH domain, followed by a C-terminal coiled-coil motif. Northern blot
analysis showed that EFA6A expression was largely restricted to brain,
with a smaller transcript expressed in small intestine, colon, and
ovary. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated punctate cell surface
expression of ARF6 (600464) and EFA6A, like EFA6B, in transfected baby
hamster kidney cells. Both EFA6 proteins also colocalized with F-actin
(see 102610).

GENE FUNCTION

Derrien et al. (2002) found that recombinant EFA6A stimulated nucleotide
exchange on myristoylated ARF6, with only low activity on ARF1 (103180).
The C-terminal region was involved in microvilli lengthening. Derrien et
al. (2002) concluded that EFA6 family guanine exchange factors are
modular proteins that work through the coordinated action of the
catalytic Sec7 domain to promote ARF6 activation, through the PH domain
to regulate association with specific subdomains of the plasma membrane,
and through the C-terminal region to control actin cytoskeletal
reorganization.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the PSD gene to chromosome 10q24.32 based on an
alignment of the PSD sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC142689) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;LEU-GLY-ASN REPEAT-ENRICHED PROTEIN; LGN;;
TRANSDUCIN-BINDING PARTNER, ROD-SPECIFIC;;
PINS, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce extracellular signals received by
cell surface receptors into integrated cellular responses. GPSM2 belongs
to a group of proteins that modulate activation of G proteins (Blumer et
al., 2002).

CLONING

Using GNAI2 (139360) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA
library, followed by screening a HeLa cell cDNA library, Mochizuki et
al. (1996) cloned full-length GPSM2, which they designated LGN due to
the presence of 10 leu-gly-asn repeats in the protein. The deduced
677-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 76 kD. The
N-terminal half of LGN contains the leu-gly-asn repeats, which are
located within 7 repeats of about 40 amino acids that form alpha helices
interrupted by turns. The C-terminal half of LGN contains 4 GoLoco
motifs (G-alpha-i/o-Loco), which are involved in guanine nucleotide
exchange. LGN also has several potential protein kinase phosphorylation
sites. RT-PCR detected LGN expression in all tissues examined.

Blumer et al. (2002) determined that human LGN shares 59% amino acid
identity with rat activator of G protein signaling-3 (AGS3, or GPSM1;
609491), with most similarity in the 7 N-terminal tetratricopeptide
repeat (TPR) motifs and the 4 C-terminal G protein regulatory motifs.
Western blot analysis detected Lgn in all rat tissues and specific brain
regions examined. Lgn was expressed in all cell lines tested and in
primary cultures of rat cortical neurons, astroglia, and microglia. In
primary neuronal cultures, Lgn was nonhomogeneously distributed in the
cell body, neuronal processes, and nucleus.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Blumer et al. (2002) mapped the GPSM2 gene
to chromosome 1p13.1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Blumer et al. (2002) determined that the GPSM2 gene contains 14 exons
and spans about 44.7 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Blumer et al. (2002) found that activation of NMDA receptors (see
138252) and elevated intracellular calcium in primary rat neuronal
cultures caused redistribution of Lgn into punctate structures in the
cell body and neuronal processes. Distribution of Lgn was dynamic in
actively dividing rat pheochromocytoma cells and COS-7 cells. During the
cell cycle, Lgn relocalized from the nucleus to the midbody, where it
colocalized with F-actin at the site of daughter cell separation during
cytokinesis.

Nair et al. (2005) investigated the presence of a guanosine diphosphate
(GDP) dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for transducin (139330) in rod
photoreceptor cells. Western blot analysis showed Lgn (but not Ags3 or
Ags1) in mouse and bovine retina. By immunofluorescence microscopy of
mouse retinal sections, Lgn was localized mostly in the inner segments
and outer plexiform layer of photoreceptor cells in both light and dark
conditions. Lgn was present in the cytosol, membrane, and the
detergent-resistant cytoskeletal fraction. The ratio of Lgn to
transducin was at least 1:15. The alpha subunit of transducin in its
GDP-bound state interacted with endogenous and recombinant Lgn, and the
recombinant G protein regulatory motif of Lgn reduced the rate of
guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange. Nair et al. (2005) concluded that
photoreceptor inner segments contain Lgn, which can bind to the alpha
subunit of transducin and potentially regulate its function.

Walsh et al. (2010) evaluated inner ear expression of Gpsm2 in mice
using immunohistochemistry. There was embryonic and perinatal expression
of Gpsm2 at the apical surfaces of the hair and supporting cells in the
cochlea, utricle, saccule, and cristae. In the cochlea, Gpsm2
localization extended throughout the greater epithelial ridge. At
postnatal day (P) 0, cochlear hair cells showed asymmetric localization
of Gpsm2 at the lateral edge, a pattern that was not present in hair
cells at embryonic day (E) 16.5. Gpsm2 also localized in pillar cells in
P0 inner ears. By P15, Gpsm2 had disappeared at the apical surface of
the cells but persisted in pillar cells. In adult mice, Gpsm2 was
concentrated specifically in the head region of the inner pillar cells.
RT-PCR studies showed that Gpsm2 expression decreased rapidly between
E16.5 and P30, dropping to a level in adult mice that was approximately
20% of that at E16.5, indicating developmental regulation.

Using in vivo skin-specific lentiviral RNA interference, Williams et al.
(2011) investigated spindle orientation regulation and provided direct
evidence that LGN, NuMA (164009), and dynactin (DCTN1; 601143) are
involved. In compromising asymmetric cell divisions, Williams et al.
(2011) uncovered profound defects in stratification, differentiation,
and barrier formation, and implicate Notch (190198) signaling as an
important effector. Williams et al. (2011) concluded that asymmetric
cell division components act by reorienting mitotic spindles to achieve
perpendicular divisions, which in turn promote stratification and
differentiation. Furthermore, the resemblance between their knockdown
phenotypes and Rbpj (147183) loss-of-function mutants provided important
clues that suprabasal Notch signaling is impaired when asymmetric cell
divisions do not occur.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a Palestinian kindred with Chudley-McCullough
syndrome (CMCS; 604213), Walsh et al. (2010) identified a homozygous
mutation in the GPSM2 gene (R127X; 609245.0001). All unaffected parents
were heterozygous for the mutation. The findings indicated that GPSM2 is
essential to the development of normal hearing, and Walsh et al. (2010)
postulated that the R127X mutation caused a defect in the maintenance of
cell polarity and spindle orientation in hair and supporting cells of
the developing inner ear. By homozygosity mapping followed by candidate
gene analysis, Yariz et al. (2012) identified a homozygous truncating
mutation in the GPSM2 gene (Q562X; 609245.0002) in affected members of a
consanguineous Turkish family with CMCS. Although the families reported
by Walsh et al. (2010) and Yariz et al. (2012) were originally reported
to have autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness 82 (DFNB82),
neuroimaging studies by Doherty et al. (2012) found abnormalities,
including short, thin corpus callosum, heterotopia, frontal
polymicrogyria, cerebellar dysplasia, and an arachnoid cyst, consistent
with a diagnosis of Chudley-McCullough syndrome.

By homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing of patients with
Chudley-McCullough syndrome, Doherty et al. (2012) identified homozygous
or compound heterozygous mutations in the GPSM2 gene
(609245.0003-609245.0006). The disorder was characterized by severe to
profound deafness and characteristic brain abnormalities on
neuroimaging, including ventriculomegaly, partial agenesis of the corpus
callosum, heterotopia, frontal polymicrogyria, cerebellar dysplasia, and
arachnoid cysts. Despite these abnormalities, neurodevelopment was
essential normal, except in 1 child who had mild to moderate
intellectual disability. Only 2 patients had seizures, which were well
controlled. There were no apparent genotype/phenotype correlations.
Doherty et al. (2012) postulated that the disorder results from
asymmetric cell divisions in the brain during development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lee et al. (2006) tested whether cell polarity genes, known to regulate
embryonic neuroblast asymmetric cell division, also regulate neuroblast
self-renewal. Clonal analysis in Drosophila larval brains showed that
pins mutant neuroblasts rapidly fail to self-renew, whereas lgl (600966)
mutant neuroblasts generate multiple neuroblasts. Notably, lgl pins
double-mutant neuroblasts all divide symmetrically to self-renew,
filling the brain with neuroblasts at the expense of neurons. The lgl
pins neuroblasts show ectopic cortical localization of atypical protein
kinase C (aPKC; see 176960), and a decrease in aPKC expression reduces
neuroblast numbers, suggesting that aPKC promotes neuroblast
self-renewal. In support of this hypothesis, Lee et al. (2006) found
that neuroblast-specific overexpression of membrane-targeted aPKC, but
not a kinase-dead version, induced ectopic neuroblast self-renewal. Lee
et al. (2006) concluded that cortical aPKC kinase activity is a potent
inducer of neuroblast self-renewal.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, ARG127TER

In 7 members of a consanguineous Palestinian kindred with
Chudley-McCullough syndrome (CMCS; 604213), Walsh et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 875C-T transition in the GPSM2 gene, resulting
in an arg127-to-ter (R127X) substitution that truncated the protein
between the second and third TPR motifs. Analysis of lymphoblast RNA
showed that the nonsense allele produced a stable mutant transcript. All
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Walsh et al.
(2010) postulated a defect in the maintenance of cell polarity and
spindle orientation in hair and supporting cells of the developing inner
ear. Although the family was originally reported to have autosomal
recessive nonsyndromic deafness 82 (DFNB82), neuroimaging of 1 patient
by Doherty et al. (2012) found abnormalities, including short, thin
corpus callosum, heterotopia, frontal polymicrogyria, cerebellar
dysplasia, and an arachnoid cyst, consistent with a diagnosis of
Chudley-McCullough syndrome.

.0002
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, GLN562TER

In 3 affected members of a consanguineous Turkish kindred with CMCS
(604213), Yariz et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 1684C-T transition
in exon 15 of the GPSM2 gene, resulting in a gln562-to-ter (Q562X)
substitution in the second GoLoco motif repeat in the C terminus. The
mutation was predicted to interfere with the association of GPSM2 with
G-alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Analysis of lymphoblast
RNA showed that the mutant transcript was stable. All unaffected parents
were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 173 controls.
The mutation was identified by homozygosity mapping followed by
candidate gene analysis. Yariz et al. (2012) suggested that the hearing
loss was related to inadequate cell polarity relating to defective
spindle orientation, resulting in impaired hair cell transduction in the
inner ear. Although the family was originally reported to have autosomal
recessive nonsyndromic deafness 82 (DFNB82), neuroimaging of all 3
patients by Doherty et al. (2012) found abnormalities, including short,
thin corpus callosum, heterotopia, frontal polymicrogyria, arachnoid
cysts, and variable cerebellar dysplasia, consistent with a diagnosis of
Chudley-McCullough syndrome.

.0003
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, 1-BP DEL, 1473G

In 5 individuals from 4 Mennonite families with Chudley-McCullough
syndrome (CMCS; 604213), Doherty et al. (2012) identified a homozygous
1-bp deletion (1473delG) in the GPSM2 gene, predicted to result in a
frameshift and premature termination (Gly491GlyfsTer6). These
individuals shared a common disease haplotype, consistent with a founder
effect. The mutations were identified by whole-exome sequencing and
confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

.0004
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, 1-BP DEL, 741C

In 2 Mennonite sibs and an unrelated European American patient, all with
Chudley-McCullough syndrome (604213), Doherty et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 1-bp deletion (742delC) in the GPSM2 gene, predicted to cause
a frameshift and premature termination (Asn247AsnfsTer34). Affected sibs
of Dutch ancestry with the disorder were compound heterozygous for
741delC and a premature termination mutation (S554X; 609245.0005).

.0005
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, SER554TER (dbSNP rs145191476)

In sibs of Dutch ancestry with Chudley-McCullough syndrome (604213),
Doherty et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion in the GPSM2 gene (609245.0004) on the paternal allele and a
1661C-A transversion, resulting in a ser554-to-ter (S554X) substitution,
on the maternal allele. This variant, which was found in the
heterozygous state in 1 of 3,510 subjects in the Exome Sequencing
Project, was designated dbSNP rs145191476.

.0006
CHUDLEY-MCCULLOUGH SYNDROME
GPSM2, IVS9DS, G-T, +1

In 2 Mexican American sibs with Chudley-McCullough syndrome (604213),
Doherty et al. (2012) identified a homozygous G-to-T transversion in the
donor splice site of exon 9 of the GPSM2 gene. The mutation caused a
transcript missing exon 9 and was predicted to result in a truncated
protein (R318RfsX8). The mutation was not found in 3,510 European
American individuals.

611194	TITLE *611194 RUN AND FYVE DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; RUFY3
;;SINGLE AXON-RELATED 1; SINGAR1;;
RAP2-INTERACTING PROTEIN X; RIPX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding RUFY3, which they
called KIAA0871, encoding a deduced 469-amino acid protein.

Using 2-dimensional electrophoresis analysis of proteins in stage 2 and
stage 3 hippocampal neurons, Mori et al. (2007) identified RUFY3, which
they called single axon-related-1 (singar1), in human, mouse, and rat.
The deduced proteins in all 3 species have 469 amino acids and contain a
RUN domain. The mouse and rat proteins contain a splice variant,
designated singar2, of 487 amino acids. Expression of singar1 in rat
brain was relatively low on embryonic day 15, peaked around postnatal
day 4, and decreased in the adult brain. Immunocytochemical analysis
showed that rat singar1 and singar2 accumulate in growth cones of minor
processes and axons.

GENE FUNCTION

Mori et al. (2007) found that rat singar1 became upregulated during
polarization of cultured hippocampal neurons and remained at high levels
thereafter. Reduction of singar1 expression by RNAi led to an increase
in the population of neurons bearing surplus axons. Overexpression of
singar1 suppressed the formation of surplus axons induced by excess
amounts of shootin1 (611171), without affecting normal polarization
processes.

MAPPING

Scott (2007) mapped the RUFY3 gene to chromosome 4q13.3 based on an
alignment of the RUFY3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020678) with the

120250	TITLE *120250 COLLAGEN, TYPE VI, ALPHA-3; COL6A3
DESCRIPTION The COL6A3 gene encodes the alpha-3 chain of type VI collagen. See also
COL6A1 (120220).

CLONING

Chu et al. (1990) isolated and sequenced human cDNA clones corresponding
to the COL6A3 gene.

Klewer et al. (1998) studied COL6A3 gene expression in the developing
mammalian heart. The pattern of expression was identical to that of
COL6A1.

By microarray analysis, Jun et al. (2001) demonstrated expression of the
COL6A3 gene in human donor corneas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stokes et al. (1991) reported information on the exons for part of the
COL6A3 gene.

MAPPING

Weil et al. (1987, 1988) localized the COL6A3 gene to chromosome 2q37 by
Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization. At least 3 other extracellular matrix genes are also
located on 2q: 2 collagen genes, COL3A1 (120180) and COL5A2 (120190),
and the fibronectin gene (135600).

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Speer et al. (1996) localized
the COL6A3 gene to chromosome 2q37 within a 17-cM region spanned by
D2S336 and D2S395. By linkage analysis, they mapped a candidate gene for
Bethlem myopathy (158810) to the same chromosomal region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pan et al. (1998) identified a mutation in the COL6A3 gene (120250.0001)
in affected members of a large American pedigree with Bethlem myopathy
(158810), a rare autosomal dominant proximal myopathy characterized by
early childhood onset and joint contractures.

Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD; 254090) is an autosomal
recessive disorder characterized by generalized muscular weakness,
contractures of multiple joints, and distal hyperextensibility. Demir et
al. (2002) demonstrated linkage of UCMD to 2q37 in 3 families, each of
which demonstrated homozygous mutation in the COL6A3 gene (see, e.g.,
120250.0002 and 120250.0003). One family had a phenotype of intermediate
severity, a second an unusually mild phenotype, and a third with a
severe phenotype as previously described in patients with UCMD. This was
the first description of mutations in COL6A3 in UCMD; previously
mutations had been described in COL6A2 (120240).

Lampe et al. (2005) developed a method for rapid direct sequence
analysis of all 107 coding exons of the COL6 genes (COL6A1, COL6A2,
COL6A3) using single condition amplification/internal primer (SCAIP)
sequencing. They sequenced all 3 COL6 genes from genomic DNA in 79
patients with UCMD or Bethlem myopathy, and found putative mutations in
1 of the COL6 genes in 62% of patients. Some patients showed changes in
more than one of the COL6 genes, and some UCMD patients appeared to have
dominant rather than recessive disease. Lampe et al. (2005) concluded
that these findings may explain some or all of the cases of UCMD that
are unlinked to the COL6 genes under a recessive model.

In 2 unrelated patients with Bethlem myopathy, Baker et al. (2007)
identified 2 different heterozygous mutations in the COL6A3 gene
(120250.0005; 120250.0006).

Nadeau et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous COL6A3 mutation
(120250.0004) in 2 unrelated individuals with autosomal dominant UCMD.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A3, GLY1679GLU

In affected members of a large American kindred with Bethlem myopathy
(158810) linked to chromosome 2, Pan et al. (1998) identified a
heterozygous G-to-A transition in the COL6A3 gene, resulting in a
gly1679-to-glu (G1679E) substitution in the N-terminal globular domain
of the protein, rather than in the triple-helical domain where mutations
had been found in the COL6A1 (120220) and COL6A2 (120240) genes. The
mutation occurred in the N2 subdomain, 1 of the von Willebrand factor
type A domains of the COL6A3 gene.

ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A3, IVS29, A-G, +5

In 3 sibs, a brother and 2 sisters, with consanguineous parents
originating from Morocco, Demir et al. (2002) identified homozygosity
for a splice donor site mutation in intron 29 (6930+5A-G) as the cause
of autosomal recessive Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090).
The phenotype was of intermediate severity. The mutation caused skipping
of exon 29 and partial reduction of collagen VI in muscle biopsy.
Neonatal hypotonia, severe in most cases, was found in all 5 cases in
the 3 families reported by Demir et al. (2002). In this family the 2
eldest sibs were never able to walk without support (calipers or walking
frame). Generalized muscle weakness, associated with predominantly
distal amyotrophy, became evident in the first years of life. Axial
muscles (mainly neck flexors), pelvic girdle muscles, and intrinsic
muscles in hands and feet were the most severely affected ones. Lower
limbs tended to be more severely affected than upper limbs; in most
cases, hip extensors and abductors were weaker than hip flexors, leading
to hip contractures that interfered with standing position. No
significant facial weakness was observed. CK levels were normal or
moderately raised (up to 4 times the normal values).

.0003
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
COL6A3, ARG465TER

In a girl of Italian extraction with unusually mild Ullrich congenital
muscular dystrophy (254090), Demir et al. (2002) found a homozygous
nonsense mutation in exon 5 of the COL6A3 gene: arg465 to ter (R465X).
Analysis of the patient's COL6A3 transcript showed the presence of
various mRNA species, one of which lacks several exons, including the
exon containing the nonsense mutation. The patient in this case was
still ambulant at age 18 and showed an unusual combination of
hyperlaxity and finger contractures (see Fig. 2). When the wrist was
extended, the retraction of finger flexor muscles impeded complete
finger extension, causing flexion contractures of fingers, which is
regarded as a characteristic 'Bethlem' sign. When the wrist was not
extended, the finger laxity became evident. The patient was able to
overlap, cross, or extend fingers beyond the normal range of motion
('Ullrich sign').

.0004
ULLRICH CONGENITAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
COL6A3, IVS16DS, G-A, +1

In a patient with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (254090), Baker
et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a de novo splice site
mutation (IVS16DS+1G-A) in intron 16 of the COL6A3 gene. The mutation
was predicted to result in loss of exon 16, which encodes amino acids 13
to 33 of the triple helical region of COL6A3.

Nadeau et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous IVS16DS+1G-A mutation in
2 unrelated patients with UCMD. The first patient was a 30-year-old
individual who had onset at birth with hypotonia, congenital hip
dislocation, delayed motor development, and feeding difficulties.
Independent walking was not achieved, and the patient became
wheelchair-bound at age 12 years. There was spinal rigidity, scoliosis,
and kyphosis, as well as follicular hyperkeratosis, keloid formation,
and need for nocturnal ventilation. The second patient had onset at age
1.5 years but never achieved independent walking and was
wheelchair-bound by age 3.5 years. This patient died at age 10 years
during a respiratory illness.

.0005
BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A3, IVS15DS, GT-TC, +1

In a 40-year-old Australian man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Baker et
al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 2-bp change (GT-to-TC) in intron 15
of the COL6A3 gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 16, which encodes
the cysteine-rich linker region and the most N-terminal 15 amino acids
of the triple helix. Further studies showed that the mutation also
resulted in a premature stop codon and nonsense-mediated decay. There
was decreased collagen VI in the extracellular matrix, indicating
impaired microfibril formation. The patient had delayed motor
development, diffuse muscle weakness, decreased motor capacity,
kyphosis, and dystrophic features on muscle biopsy.

.0006
BETHLEM MYOPATHY
COL6A3, LEU1726ARG

In a 20-year-old man with Bethlem myopathy (158810), Baker et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous 5177T-G transversion in a highly conserved
residue in exon 11 of the COL6A3 gene, resulting in a leu1726-to-arg
(L1726R) substitution in the globular N2 A domain. The patient had
reduced motor capacity, proximal muscle weakness, joint contractures,
and dystrophic findings on muscle biopsy. Further studies showed normal
levels of collagen VI in the extracellular matrix, indicating that the
mutant protein was able to fold and incorporate into collagen VI.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) is a glycolytic enzyme
that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The enzyme is
a tetramer of identical 40-kD subunits. Vertebrates have 3 aldolase
isozymes, aldolases A, B (ALDOB; 612724), and C (ALDOC; 103870), which
are distinguished by their electrophoretic and catalytic properties. The
sequence of the aldolases around the active-site lysine is highly
conserved in evolution. Mammalian tissues express aldolase isozymes in a
well-characterized pattern. Developing embryo produces aldolase A, which
continues to be expressed in many adult tissues, sometimes at much
higher levels than in embryo. In adult muscle, aldolase A can be as much
as 5% of total cellular protein. In adult liver, kidney, and intestine,
aldolase A expression is repressed and aldolase B is produced. In brain
and other nervous tissue, aldolase A and C are expressed about equally.
In transformed liver cells, aldolase A replaces aldolase B (Rottmann et
al., 1984).

CLONING

Electrophoretic variants of fructoaldolase were reported by Charlesworth
(1972).

Sakakibara et al. (1985) cloned aldolase A from a human liver cDNA
library. The deduced protein contains 363 amino acids. RNA blot analysis
revealed a 1.6-kb ALDOA mRNA in skeletal muscle and a 1.7-kb ALDOA mRNA
in liver and placenta.

Freemont et al. (1988) presented the complete amino acid sequence of
human skeletal muscle fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, comprising 363
residues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Izzo et al. (1988) found that the ALDOA gene spans 7.5 kb and contains
12 exons. It occurs as a single copy per haploid human genome. Eight
exons containing the coding sequence were common to all mRNAs extracted
from several mammalian sources. Four additional exons were identified in
the 5-prime UTR: the first was contained in the ubiquitous mRNA, the
second in the muscle-specific mRNA, and the third and fourth in a minor
mRNA in human liver. S(1)-nuclease-protection analysis of the 5-prime
end of mRNA from cultured fibroblasts, muscle, and hepatoma cell lines
revealed 4 different transcription initiation sites. The presence of
conventional sequences for 4 eukaryotic promoters was also demonstrated.
The nucleotide similarities in the coding region and the intron-exon
organization of aldolases A, B, and C confirmed that they arose from a
common ancestral gene, with aldolase B diverging first.

MAPPING

Harris (1974) concluded that 3 loci determine aldolase. Cohen-Haguenauer
et al. (1985) assigned aldolase A to chromosome 16, whereas Kukita et
al. (1985) assigned it to chromosome 22. However, Kukita et al. (1987)
mapped the ALDOA gene to chromosome 16 by 3 different methods: molecular
hybridization to hybrid cell DNA, molecular hybridization to DNA of
sorted metaphase chromosomes, and in situ hybridization. In situ
hybridization indicated that the gene is located on the chromosome
16q22-q24 band. Serero et al. (1988) also assigned the aldolase A gene
to chromosome 16 by Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA with a
cDNA probe. Aldolase A pseudogenes were found on chromosomes 3 and 10.
The map location of the 3 aldolase genes and the aldolase pseudogene
(see 612724) is of considerable interest from the point of view of
chromosome evolution. The 4 genes are found on 2 pairs of
morphologically similar chromosomes, 9 and 10, and 16 and 17. These
homeologous (i.e., of similar origin) chromosome pairs may have arisen
from 1 or 2 tetraploidization events (Comings, 1972; Ohno, 1973). As
predicted by the chromosomal locations, the coding sequences of the
expressed aldolase A and C genes on chromosomes 16 and 17, respectively,
are more homologous to each other than either of them is to the
expressed aldolase B gene on chromosome 9.

Amberger (2008) mapped the ALDOA gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the ALDOA sequence (GenBank GENBANK M11560) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kishi et al. (1987) studied a patient with red cell aldolase deficiency,
or glycogen storage disease XII (GSD12; 611881), and identified a
mutation in the ALDOA gene that resulted in an asp128-to-gly (D128G;
103850.0001) substitution in the protein. The patient's enzyme from red
cells and from cultured lymphoblastoid cells was highly thermolabile,
and the enzyme expressed in E. coli was likewise thermolabile. The
parents had intermediate levels of red cell aldolase A. Southern blot
analysis of genomic DNA showed that the patient was homozygous for a
mutation that was heterozygous in both parents.

In a boy with aldolase A deficiency, Kreuder et al. (1996) identified a
homozygous germline mutation in the ALDOA gene that resulted
substitution of a negatively charged glutamic acid with a positively
charged lysine at the highly conserved residue 206 (E206L; 103850.0002).
The affected residue is highly conserved within the subunit interface
region.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XII
ALDOA, ASP128GLY

In a patient with red cell aldolase deficiency, or glycogen storage
disease XII (GSD12; 611881), Kishi et al. (1987) identified an A-G
transversion at nucleotide 386 in the codon for the 128th amino acid,
leading to a change from aspartic acid (GAU) to glycine (GGU) (D128G) in
the aldolase protein. The patient's enzyme from red cells and from
cultured lymphoblastoid cells was highly thermolabile, and the enzyme
expressed in E. coli was likewise thermolabile. Since asp128 is
conserved in aldolase A, B (612724), and C (103870) of eukaryotes,
including Drosophila, this residue likely has a crucial role in
maintaining the correct spatial structure or in performing the catalytic
function of the enzyme. The parents had intermediate levels of red cell
aldolase A. The change in the aspartic acid codon extinguished an Fok1
restriction site (GGATG to GGGTG). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA
showed that the patient was homozygous for a mutation that was
heterozygous in both parents.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XII
ALDOA, GLU206LYS

Kreuder et al. (1996) described a 4 1/2-year-old boy with predominantly
myopathic symptoms of aldolase A deficiency (611881) due to substitution
of a single amino acid within the subunit interface most essential for
the tetrameric structure of the enzyme. The patient showed muscle
weakness and premature muscle fatigue. He was unable to walk for more
than 10 minutes or climb more than 20 steps at a time. Several
unexplained episodes of jaundice and anemia required blood transfusions
during the first year of life. The parents were healthy and
nonconsanguineous. The patient showed slight jaundice, diminished muscle
mass, reduced muscle tone, and proximal muscle weakness. The liver and
spleen were somewhat enlarged. Creatine kinase was markedly elevated in
the blood of this patient, and several muscle enzymes, as well as serum
bilirubin, were increased. Codon 206 of the ALDOA gene was found to have
a homozygous transition from GAG (glu) to AAG (lys) (E206K). The authors
noted that a glutamate is present in all human aldolases at position 206
of the enzyme. Both parents and a healthy brother were heterozygous for
the mutation.

602283	TITLE *602283 CHEMOKINE, CC MOTIF, LIGAND 8; CCL8
;;SMALL INDUCIBLE CYTOKINE SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 8; SCYA8;;
MONOCYTE CHEMOTACTIC PROTEIN 2; MCP2
DESCRIPTION Chemokines, a family of small cytokines, attract leukocytes and possess
various immunomodulating functions. The C-C chemokines, which Van
Coillie et al. (1997) stated to be located on 17q11.2, influence
mononuclear cell types. Van Damme et al. (1992) isolated MCP2 from
stimulated osteosarcoma cells, determined its nearly complete amino acid
sequence, and identified it as a monocyte chemotactic factor based on a
pattern of conserved cysteine residues. By degenerate PCR with primers
based on C-C chemokine consensus sequences, Van Coillie et al. (1997)
isolated the MCP2 gene from a YAC contig from human chromosome 17q11.2.
Van Coillie et al. (1997) stated that the MCP2 gene contains 3 exons in
a span of about 3 kb and encodes a predicted 109-amino acid protein. The
mature MCP2 protein is approximately 75 amino acids long Van Damme et
al. (1992). Van Coillie et al. (1997) deduced that intron/exon structure
was conserved among MCP1 (158105), MCP2, and MCP3 (158106), and reported
that these genes share 77% coding nucleotide sequence homology. Van
Coillie et al. (1997) stated that the predicted protein sequence matches
the sequence of purified mature MCP2 reported by Van Damme et al. (1992)
with the exception of 1 lysine-to-glutamine change, which Van Coillie et
al. (1997) considered a polymorphism or cloning artifact. By Northern
blot analysis, Van Coillie et al. (1997) detected a major 1-kb
transcript in most tissues tested, with greatest expression in small
intestine and peripheral blood cells. Transcripts of 1.5 and 2.4 kb were
also observed.

611106	TITLE *611106 ZINC FINGER CCCH DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 12D; ZC3H12D
;;p34;;
C6ORF95;;
MCPIP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZC3H12D is a CCCH-type zinc finger protein, like TTP (ZFP36; 190700),
ZAP (ZC3HAV1; 607312), and ROQUIN (RC3H1; 609424), whereas most
mammalian zinc finger proteins are CCHH- or CCCC-type proteins. Liang et
al. (2008) found that ZC3H12B, also known as MCPIP2, and other MCPIP
proteins, MCPIP1 (ZC3H12A; 610562), MCPIP2 (ZC3H12B; 300889), and MCPIP3
(ZC3H12C; 615001), regulate macrophage activation.

CLONING

Wang et al. (2007) reported frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on
chromosome 6q25.1 in sporadic lung tumors (211980) and determined a
2.2-Mb minimum region of LOH. By direct sequencing and SNP genotyping
using genomic DNAs from lung cancer pedigrees showing linkage to this
region, they identified a novel candidate gene, ZC3H12D, and identified
a nonsynonymous A/G SNP at codon 106 that changes a lysine to an
arginine. The deduced 321-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular
mass of 34 kD and contains a zinc finger CCCH (C-x8-C-x5-C-x3-H) motif.
The protein shares significant blocks of conservation with homologs in
other mammals and in lower organisms such as zebrafish and Drosophila.

By database searching for genes similar to MCPIP1, Liang et al. (2008)
identified MCPIP4, a 527-amino acid protein containing a single central
CCCH-type zinc finger and no other identifiable motifs. Mouse
macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not Ifng
(147570), showed some induction of MCPIP4 by Northern blot analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2007) performed in vitro clonogenic and in vivo nude mouse
studies which showed that overexpression of the ZC3H12D 106A allele
exerts tumor suppressor function compared with the G allele.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2007) found that approximately 73% (8/11) of heterozygous
lung cancer tissues with LOH and the A/G SNP also exhibited loss of the
A allele. Wang et al. (2007) noted that the ZC3H12D gene was located
within a region containing a lung cancer susceptibility locus (608935),
but association studies of the A/G SNP demonstrated no association
between the less frequent 106G (arginine) allele and lung cancer
susceptibility in the families studied by Bailey-Wilson et al. (2004).

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2007) determined that the ZC3H12D gene contains 6 coding
exons and 2 untranslated exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2007) mapped the ZC3H12D gene
to chromosome 6q25.1 (build 36.2).

611685	TITLE *611685 RING FINGER PROTEIN 8; RNF8
;;KIAA0646
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones from a size-fractionated brain cDNA library,
Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned RNF8, which they designated KIAA0646. The
cDNA contains repetitive elements in its 3-prime end. The deduced
485-amino acid protein contains a C3HC4-type zinc finger signature,
suggesting that it is involved in nucleic acid management. RT-PCR
analysis detected moderate RNF8 expression in brain, testis, and ovary,
with little to no expression in all other tissues examined. In vitro
translation resulted in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 62
kD by SDS-PAGE.

Using oligo capping, Seki et al. (1998) cloned RNF8 from a neuroblastoma
cDNA library. The deduced 485-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 56 kD. RT-PCR analysis detected variable expression in
all human tissues examined except spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and protein pull-down assays, Takano et
al. (2004) showed that RNF8 and retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRA; 180245)
interacted via their N-terminal regions. Overexpression of RNF8 in COS-7
cells resulted in interaction and colocalization of RNF8 and RXRA in the
nucleus. A point mutation in RNF8 that disrupted the RING finger or
deletion of the N-terminal region of RNF8 prevented localization of RNF8
to the nucleus without affecting nuclear localization of RXRA. Transient
overexpression of RNF8 enhanced RXRA-mediated transactivation of an
RXR-responsive element (RXRE) in a dose-dependent and retinoic
acid-independent manner and upregulated expression of genes downstream
of RXRE. Enhancement of transactivation was not seen with RNF8 carrying
the RING finger-disrupting mutation or the N-terminal deletion. Takano
et al. (2004) concluded that RNF8 is a regulator of RXRA-mediated
transcriptional activity.

Kolas et al. (2007) determined that the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 mediates
ubiquitin conjugation and 53BP1 (605230) and BRCA1 (113705) focal
accumulation at sites of DNA lesions. Moreover, Kolas et al. (2007)
established that MDC1 recruits RNF8 through phosphodependent
interactions between the RNF8 forkhead-associated domain and motifs in
MDC1 that are phosphorylated by the DNA damage-activated protein kinase
ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM; 607585). They showed that depletion
of the E2 enzyme UBC13 (603679) impairs 53BP1 recruitment to sites of
damage, which suggests that it cooperates with RNF8. RNF8 was also shown
to promote the G(2)/M DNA damage checkpoint and resistance to ionizing
radiation. Kolas et al. (2007) concluded that their results demonstrated
how the DNA damage response is orchestrated by ATM-dependent
phosphorylation of MDC1 and RNF8-mediated ubiquitination.

Yan et al. (2012) noted that RNF8 works with UBC13 to catalyze
lys63-linked polyubiquitination of H2A (see 613499)-type histones at
sites of DNA damage. They found that depletion of RNF8 in HeLa cells
abrogated the recruitment of FAAP20 (C1OR86; 615183) to sites of DNA
damage. Knockdown of either RNF8 or FAAP20 abrogated the recruitment of
FANCA (607139) and FANCD2 (613984) to sites of DNA damage.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the RNF8
gene to chromosome 6. Seki et al. (1998) mapped the RNF8 gene to
chromosome 6p21.3 by somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses.

ANIMAL MODEL

Santos et al. (2010) reported that Rnf8 -/- mice were defective in class
switch recombination (CSR) and accumulated immunoglobulin heavy chain
(IgH; see 147100)-associated double-strand breaks (DSB). The CSR DSB
repair defect was milder than that in 53bp1 -/- mice, but similar to
that in H2ax (601772) -/- mice. Like H2ax -/- mice, Rnf8 -/- males were
sterile, and this was associated with defective XY chromatin
ubiquitylation. Mice lacking both H2ax and Rnf8 did not have further
impairment of CSR. Although 53bp1 foci formation is Rnf8 dependent,
53bp1 could bind to chromatin in the absence of Rnf8. Santos et al.
(2010) proposed that there is a 2-step mechanism for 53BP1 association
with chromatin in which constitutive loading is dependent on
interactions with methylated histones, whereas DNA damage-inducible
RNF8-dependent ubiquitylation allows its accumulation at damaged
chromatin.

Li et al. (2010) studied Rnf8 -/- mice and observed growth retardation,
reduced hematopoietic populations, impaired spermatogenesis, impaired
CSR, and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation in vitro and in
vivo. Activated Rnf8 -/- B cells were able to recruit reduced amounts of
53bp1 via Rnf8-independent mechanisms. Rnf8 -/- mice also had a somewhat
increased cancer predisposition. Li et al. (2010) concluded that RNF8 is
a tumor suppressor whose loss also results in increased
non-cancer-related mortality, likely due to immunodeficiency.

602334	TITLE *602334 EPITHELIAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN 2; EMP2
DESCRIPTION By homology screening of databases, Ben-Porath and Benvenisty (1996) and
Taylor and Suter (1996) independently identified a cDNA encoding
epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2). The predicted 167-amino acid EMP2
protein contains 4 membrane-spanning domains and 3 N-linked
glycosylation motifs in the first extracellular loop. Taylor and Suter
(1996) showed that the EMP2 cDNA generates an 18-kD protein in vitro.
The EMP2 protein shares 43% amino acid identity with peripheral myelin
protein-22 (PMP22; 601097); they are particularly homologous in their
transmembrane domains. Due to the high amino acid sequence homology
among PMP22, EMP1 (602334), EMP2, and EMP3 (602335), Ben-Porath and
Benvenisty (1996) stated that these proteins belong to a novel family.
Based on the suggested functions of PMP22, Ben-Porath and Benvenisty
(1996) and Taylor and Suter (1996) proposed that EMP2 is involved in
cell proliferation and cell-cell interactions. Using Northern blot
analysis, Taylor and Suter (1996) found prominent EMP2 expression in
adult ovary, heart, lung, and intestine and lower expression in most
other tissues, including the liver. In the fetus, they found high EMP2
mRNA levels in the lung and kidney and lower levels in the liver and
brain.

By somatic cell hybridization, radiation hybrid analysis, and YAC
library screening, Liehr et al. (1999) mapped the EMP2 gene to
chromosome 16p13.2. Ben Porath et al. (1998) mapped the homologous gene
in the mouse to chromosome 16.

613666	TITLE *613666 ALG11, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; ALG11
;;ASPARAGINE-LINKED GLYCOSYLATION 11, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
KIAA0266
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ALG11 is a mannosyltransferase that uses GDP-mannose to sequentially add
the fourth and fifth mannose residues to growing dolichol-linked
oligosaccharide side chains at the outer leaflet of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). Upon completion, the lipid-linked polyoligosaccharides
are translocated to the ER lumen for subsequent transfer to substrate
asparagine residues of newly synthesized glycoproteins (Rind et al.,
2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated KG-1 immature
myeloid cell line, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned ALG11, which they
designated KIAA0266. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its
3-prime end, and the deduced protein contains 766 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis revealed low and uniform expression of ALG11 in all human
tissues and cell lines examined.

Rind et al. (2010) predicted that human ALG11 contains 2 Rossmann-like
type B domains, which are separated by a catalytic flexible hinge
region, and a conserved C-terminal nucleotide sugar-binding region.
ALG11 also has 2 predicted transmembrane domains and 2 putative
N-glycosylation sites. Immunofluorescence analysis of human fibroblasts
revealed colocalization of ALG11 with an ER marker, calnexin (CANX;
114217).

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the ALG11 gene
to chromosome 13. Hartz (2010) mapped the ALG11 gene to chromosome
13q14.3 based on an alignment of the ALG11 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AK025456) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 Turkish sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with congenital
disorder of glycosylation type Ip (CDG1P; 613661), Rind et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous mutation (L86S; 613666.0001) in the ALG11 gene.
The phenotype was a multisystem metabolic disorder characterized by
hypotonia, seizures, developmental retardation, deafness, and death by
age 2 years. One affected child showed mild dysmorphic features.

In 3 unrelated patients with CDG1P, Thiel et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in the ALG11 gene
(613666.0002-613666.0006). All mutations occurred in conserved residues,
and the cellular biochemical defects could be rescued by retroviral
complementation with wildtype ALG11. Glucose starvation prior to
metabolic labeling of patient-derived fibroblasts was a crucial step for
the correct biochemical diagnosis.

In 2 Turkish sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with congenital
disorder of glycosylation type Ip (CDG1P; 613661), Rind et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 257T-C transition in exon 2 of the ALG11 gene,
resulting in a leu86-to-ser (L86S) substitution in a highly conserved
region in the N terminus between 2 hydrophobic helices at the end of a
glycine-rich motif. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 100 control alleles. Introduction of
wildtype ALG11 in patient fibroblasts and yeast deficient in the enzyme
complemented the biochemical abnormality. Immunofluorescent studies
showed that the mutation did not affect protein localization and did not
appear to affect the stability of the mannosyltransferase complex.
However, studies in yeast showed that the mutant L86S protein had some
residual activity, but not as much as wildtype, suggesting that it is a
leaky mutation.

In a 7-year-old girl with CDG1P (613661), Thiel et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ALG11 gene: an 18-bp
deletion (623_642) resulting in a frameshift and premature truncation
after 210 amino acids, and an 836A-C transversion resulting in a
tyr279-to-ser (Y279S; 613666.0003) substitution. The patient had
developmental delay, mental retardation, axial hypotonia, slight
peripheral hypertonia, no communication and poor social interaction,
seizures, and strabismus. Neither mutation was found in 120 control
alleles. Biochemical analysis showed a CDG type I pattern. However, the
pathologic glycosylation phenotype was only apparent after glucose
starvation in patient fibroblasts; then, analysis of dolichol-linked
oligosaccharides led to the emergence of pathologic shortened
intermediate dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, indicating a defect in
biosynthesis which could be rescued by retroviral complementation with
wildtype ALG11.

retardation, central hypotonia, peripheral hypertonia, no communication,
and seizures. Other anomalies included dystrophic facial features with
high forehead, long philtrum, and retrognathia, dry scaly skin,
oscillation of body temperature, inverted nipples, fat pads, and

CONGENITAL DISORDER OF GLYCOSYLATION, TYPE Ip
ALG11, GLN318PRO

In an 8.5-year-old boy with CDG1P (613661), Thiel et al. (2012)
identified a homozygous 953A-C transversion in the ALG11 gene, resulting
in a gln318-to-pro (Q318P) substitution. The patient had developmental
delay, mental retardation, no communication, seizures, and strabismus.
The mutation was not found in 120 control alleles. Biochemical analysis
showed a CDG type I pattern. However, the pathologic glycosylation
phenotype was only apparent after glucose starvation in patient
fibroblasts; then, analysis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides led to
the emergence of pathologic shortened intermediate dolichol-linked
oligosaccharides, indicating a defect in biosynthesis which could be
rescued by retroviral complementation with wildtype ALG11.

603925	TITLE *603925 SYNAPTOGYRIN 1; SYNGR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Rat synaptogyrin, or RATSYNGR1, is an integral membrane protein
associated with presynaptic vesicles in neuronal cells. See SYNGR2
(603926). As part of an effort to sequence the long arm of human
chromosome 22, Kedra et al. (1998) identified the human homolog of
RATSYNGR1, synaptogyrin-1 (SYNGR1). By a combination of EST database
searching and library screening, the authors isolated cDNAs
corresponding to 3 alternatively spliced transcripts, which they
designated SYNGR1a-c. The predicted 1a, 1b, and 1c proteins contain 234,
191, and 192 amino acids, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed
that the 4.5-kb SYNGR1a mRNA is expressed at high levels in brain. The
other transcript forms are expressed at low levels in nonneuronal
tissues. In situ hybridization to embryonic and adult mouse tissues
confirmed that SYNGR1a, the most abundant transcript form, shows
predominantly neuronal expression. Kedra et al. (1998) also identified
cDNAs encoding the related human proteins SYNGR2 and SYNGR3 (603927) and
mouse Syngr1b. Like RATSYNGR1, the mouse and human synaptogyrin family
members contain 4 membrane-spanning domains. The conserved central
portion of SYNGR1a shares 54%, 61%, and 92% identity with that of
SYNGR2, SYNGR3, and RATSYNGR1, respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kedra et al. (1998) determined that the SYNGR1 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By inclusion within mapped clones, Kedra et al. (1998) mapped the SYNGR1
gene to chromosome 22q13. These authors found that SYNGR2 is located on
17qter and noted that the synaptogyrins and several other gene families
contain paralogous genes located on chromosomes 17 and 22. They stated
that this result supports the hypothesis that 17q and 22q are
evolutionarily closely related, and that these 2 regions in the human
genome are the result of a large chromosome duplication.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting, Janz et al. (1999) generated mice lacking Syngr1.
They bred these Syngr1 knockout mice against Syp (313475) knockout mice
generated by McMahon et al. (1996) to create double knockout mice
deficient in both Syp and Syngr1. Both single and double knockout mice
were viable and fertile. Morphologic and biochemical analysis showed
that the architecture and composition of synapses were unaltered in the
brains of Syngr1 single knockout and Syngr1/Syp double knockout mutant
mice. Electrophysiologic recordings in the hippocampal CA1 region
revealed that short- and long-term synaptic plasticity was severely
reduced in the Syngr1/Syp double knockout mice without changes in the
fundamental release apparatus, vesicle cycling, or release probability.
Janz et al. (1999) concluded that Syngr1 and Syp perform essential and
redundant functions in synaptic plasticity without being required for
synaptic transmission as such.

From the results of cotransfection experiments, Janz et al. (1999)
concluded that Syp and Syngr1 are phosphorylated by c-fyn and c-src
tyrosine kinases. The absence of Syp and Syngr1 in knockout mice did not
markedly affect tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins.

611043	TITLE *611043 LIN28, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A; LIN28A
;;LIN28;;
ZINC FINGER CCHC DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; ZCCHC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of C. elegans lin28, a regulator
of developmental timing, Moss and Tang (2003) identified homologs in
several species from Drosophila to human. In each species the protein
contains a conserved combination of RNA-binding motifs: a cold shock
domain (CSD) and a pair of retroviral-type CCHC zinc knuckles. The human
and mouse LIN28A proteins share 97% sequence identity. Yang and Moss
(2003) showed that in mammals, LIN28A protein is stage-specifically
expressed in embryonic muscle, neurons, and epithelia, as well as in
embryonic carcinoma cells; however, it is suppressed in most adult
tissues except for skeletal and cardiac muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moss and Tang (2003) determined that the LIN28A gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Moss and Tang (2003) mapped the human LIN28A gene
to chromosome 1 and the mouse Lin28a gene to a region of syntenic
homology on chromosome 4.

Scott (2007) mapped the LIN28A gene to chromosome 1p36.11 based on an
alignment of the LIN28A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF521099) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

GENE FUNCTION

Wu and Belasco (2005) showed that human LIN28 mRNA is a target of the
micro RNAs miR-125b (610104) and miRNA-125a (611191). They identified 2
miRNA-responsive elements (miREs) that mediate repression in the 3-prime
UTR of LIN28. When the miREs were deleted, miRNA control over LIN28
nearly vanished. Lin28 downregulation by miR-125 involved reductions in
both translational efficiency and mRNA abundance.

By use of loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays in cultured
myoblasts, Polesskaya et al. (2007) showed that expression of Lin28 was
essential for skeletal muscle differentiation in mice and that Lin28
binds to polysomes, thereby increasing the efficiency of protein
synthesis. An important target of Lin28 is Igf2 (147470), a growth and
differentiation factor for muscle tissue. Interaction of Lin28 with
translation initiation complexes in skeletal myoblasts and in the
embryonic carcinoma cell line P19 was confirmed by localization of Lin28
to the stress granules, temporary structures that contain stalled
mRNA-protein translation complexes.

Yu et al. (2007) showed that 4 factors, OCT4 (164177), SOX2 (184429),
NANOG (607937), and LIN28, are sufficient to reprogram human somatic
cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential
characteristics of embryonic stem cells. These induced pluripotent human
stem cells have normal karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express
cell surface markers and genes that characterize human ES cells, and
maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into advanced
derivatives of all 3 primary germ layers.

Viswanathan et al. (2008) showed that Lin28 selectively blocks the
processing of Let7 (see 605386) primary (pri-Let7) miRNAs in embryonic
cells. Using in vitro and in vivo studies, they found that Lin28 is
necessary and sufficient for blocking Microprocessor-mediated cleavage
of pri-Let7 miRNAs. Viswanathan et al. (2008) concluded that their
results identified Lin28 as a negative regulator of miRNA biogenesis,
and suggested that Lin28 may play a central role in blocking
miRNA-mediated differentiation in stem cells and in certain cancers.

Viswanathan et al. (2009) found that overexpression of murine Lin28 and
Lin28b (611044) in NIH/3T3 cells depleted levels of multiple mature
miRNAS in the LET7 family and resulted in increased c-Myc (190080) as
well as colony formation. Cells expressing either Lin28 or human LIN28B
formed tumors in nude mice. In vitro and in vivo studies with
cytokine-dependent BaF/3 cells showed that overexpression of LIN28 could
facilitate cellular transformation. LIN28 and LIN28B were found to be
overexpressed in primary human tumors and human cancer cell lines
(overall frequency of about 15%), and overexpression was linked to
repression of LET7 family miRNAs and derepression of LET7 target genes.
The findings provided a mechanism for the coordinate repression of LET7
miRNAs observed in a subset of human cancers, and associated activation
of LIN28 and LIN28B with poor clinical prognosis.

West et al. (2009) differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a
Stella (DPPA3; 608408) transgenic reporter into putative primordial germ
cells (PGCs) in vitro. The Stella-positive cells possessed a
transcriptional profile similar to embryo-derived PGCs, and like their
counterparts in vivo, lost imprints in a time-dependent manner. Using
inhibitory RNAs to screen candidate genes for effects on the development
of Stella-positive cells in vitro, West et al. (2009) found that Lin28,
a negative regulator of let7 microRNA processing, is essential for
proper PGC development. Furthermore, Blimp1 (PRDM1; 603423), a let7
target and a master regulator of PGC specification, rescued the effect
of Lin28 deficiency during PGC development, thereby establishing a
mechanism of action for Lin28 during PGC specification. Overexpression
of Lin28 promotes formation of Stella-positive cells in vitro and PGCs
in chimeric embryos, and is associated with human germ cell tumors.

Hanna et al. (2009) demonstrated that the reprogramming by Oct4, Sox2,
Klf4, and Myc transcription factors is a continuous stochastic process
where almost all mouse donor cells eventually give rise to induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cells on continued growth and transcription
factor expression. Additional inhibition of the p53 (191170)/p21
(116899) pathway or overexpression of Lin28 increased the cell division
rate and resulted in an accelerated kinetics of iPS cell formation that
was directly proportional to the increase in cell proliferation. In
contrast, Nanog overexpression accelerated reprogramming in a
predominantly cell division rate-independent manner. Quantitative
analyses defined distinct cell division rate-dependent and -independent
modes for accelerating the stochastic course of reprogramming, and
suggested that the number of cell divisions is a key parameter driving
epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency.

The pluripotency factor LIN28 blocks the expression of LET7 microRNAs in
undifferentiated cells during development by binding to pre-LET7 RNAs
and recruiting RNA uridyltransferases ZCCHC11 (613692) and ZCCHC6 to
uridylate pre-let7. The identity of the RNase that degrades uridylated
pre-LET7 was unknown. Chang et al. (2013) identified Dis3l2 (614184) as
the 3-prime-5-prime exonuclease responsible for the decay of uridylated
pre-let7 in mouse embryonic stem cells. Biochemical reconstitution
assays showed that 3-prime oligouridylation stimulates Dis3l2 activity
in vitro, and knockdown of Dis3l2 in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to
the stabilization of pre-let7. Chang et al. (2013) concluded that their
study established 3-prime oligouridylation as an RNA decay signal for
DIS3L2 and identified the first physiologic RNA substrate of this
exonuclease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhu et al. (2010) generated transgenic mice expressing Lin28a and
observed increased body size and crown-rump length, with increased bone
mineral content and density, and delayed onset of puberty. The
transgenic mice also had increased glucose metabolism and insulin
sensitivity. Zhu et al. (2010) noted that this phenotype models that of
human phenotypes (see MENAQ2, 612882) associated with genetic variation
in the LIN28-LET7 pathway.

602732	TITLE *602732 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1; ARHGAP1
;;GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RHO, 1;;
RHOGAP1;;
RHOGAP;;
CDC42GAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Rho family of GTP-binding proteins modulates cytoskeletal changes.
Garrett et al. (1991) purified a 29-kD cytoplasmic GTPase-activating
protein (GAP), called RHOGAP by them, from human spleen extracts. RHOGAP
stimulated the GTPase activity of p21-Rho but not other small molecular
mass GTP-binding proteins. Diekmann et al. (1991) reported a partial
amino acid sequence of RHOGAP. Using PCR with primers based on the
RHOGAP protein sequence, Lancaster et al. (1994) isolated a human
fibrosarcoma cell line cDNA encoding RHOGAP. Northern blot analysis
revealed that RHOGAP is expressed as a 3.6-kb mRNA. The RHOGAP cDNA
encodes a predicted 439-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 50 kD. Since antibodies against RHOGAP detected a 50-kD protein
on Western blots of cell extracts, Lancaster et al. (1994) suggested
that the previously observed 29-kD protein was a C-terminal proteolytic
fragment of RHOGAP that was generated during protein purification.

Barfod et al. (1993) cloned human platelet-precursor cell cDNAs encoding
CDC42GAP, a protein that inactivates CDC42 by stimulating GTP
hydrolysis. They found that CDC42GAP contains a functional SH3-binding
domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Lancaster et al. (1994) found that the Rho family members Rho, RAC, and
CDC42 (116952) were substrates for RHOGAP, with CDC42 the preferred
substrate.

Shen et al. (2008) showed that Nudel (NDEL1; 607538) colocalized with
Cdc42gap at the leading edge of migrating NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. This
localization of Nudel required its phosphorylation by Erk1 (MAPK3;
601795)/Erk2 (MAPK1; 176948). Shen et al. (2008) found that Nudel
competed with Cdc42 for binding Cdc42gap. Consequently, Nudel inhibited
Cdc42gap-mediated inactivation of Cdc42 in a dose-dependent manner.
Depletion of Nudel by RNA interference or overexpression of a
nonphosphorylatable Nudel mutant abolished Cdc42 activation and cell
migration. Shen et al. (2008) concluded that NUDEL facilitates cell
migration by sequestering CDC42GAP at the leading edge to stabilize
active CDC42 in response to extracellular stimuli.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RHOGAP1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH79109).

613653	TITLE *613653 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 5, ZETA-1 SUBUNIT; AP5Z1
;;KIAA0415;;
SPG48 GENE; SPG48
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned KIAA0415. The deduced 634-amino
acid protein shares weak similarity with cyclin A1 (CCNA1; 604036).
RT-PCR detected variable KIAA0415 expression in all tissues examined. In
vitro-translated KIAA0415 had an apparent molecular mass of 68 kD by
SDS-PAGE.

Using RNA interference to screen HeLa cells for proteins involved in
homologous recombination DNA double-strand break repair, followed by
database analysis, Slabicki et al. (2010) identified KIAA0415, which
they called SPG48. KIAA0415 has a putative C-terminal helicase domain
characteristic of superfamily 2 (SF2)-type helicases. Western blot
analysis detected 2 possible KIAA0415 isoforms. Cell fractionation
revealed that the shorter isoform was predominantly nuclear, whereas the
longer isoform was predominantly cytoplasmic.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of HeLa cells, Slabicki et al. (2010)
showed that KIAA0415 exists in a core protein complex containing SPG11
(610844), SPG15 (ZFYVE26; 612012), C20ORF29 (AP5S1; 614824), and
DKFZp761E198 (614367). Knockdown of KIAA0415, C20ORF29, or SPG15 in HeLa
cells reduced homologous recombination in a test substrate, whereas
knockdown of SPG11 or DKFZp761E198 had no effect. Knockdown of KIAA0415
also reduced homologous recombination in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Slabicki et al. (2010) determined that the KIAA0415 gene contains 17
coding exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the KIAA0415
gene to chromosome 7. Gross (2010) mapped the KIAA0415 gene to
chromosome 7p22.1 based on an alignment of the KIAA0415 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AB007875) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By direct sequencing of the KIAA0415 gene in 166 unrelated patients with
unexplained hereditary spastic paraplegia, Slabicki et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous truncating mutation (613653.0001) in 2 affected
French sibs. Another patient with sporadic disease was heterozygous for
a deletion (613653.0002), but a second mutation was not identified. The
phenotype was consistent with adult-onset SPG48 (613647). Studies of
lymphoblastoid cells derived from 1 patient showed increased sensitivity
to DNA-damaging drugs. The findings suggested a link between this form
of spastic paraplegia, which could be considered a neurodegenerative
disease, and defects in DNA repair. Slabicki et al. (2010) studied
KIAA0415 as a candidate gene in this disorder because of its role in a
complex with the other SPG-related genes SPG11 and SPG15.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 48, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
KIAA0415, 4-BP DEL/22-BP INS, NT80

In 2 French sibs with autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia-48 (SPG48;
613647), Slabicki et al. (2010) identified a homozygous complex
insertion/deletion mutation in exon 2 of the KIAA0415 gene. The mutation
comprised a 4-bp deletion (80del4) and a 22-bp insertion (84ins22),
resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon following residue 29.
The insertion was found to be an imperfect quadruplication of a
sequence, suggesting DNA polymerase slippage during DNA synthesis as the
pathogenetic mechanism. The patients presented with progressive spastic
paraplegia associated with urinary incontinence from ages 50 and 49
years, respectively. One had a normal cerebral MRI, whereas the other
had spinal hyperintensities in the cervical spine. The unaffected
parents were not known to be consanguineous, but they originated from 2
neighboring villages. The mutation was not found in 156 Caucasian or 242
North African control chromosomes. Studies of lymphoblastoid cells
derived from 1 patient showed increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging
drugs. The findings suggested a link between this form of spastic
paraplegia, which could be considered a neurodegenerative disease, and
defects in DNA repair.

In a patient with sporadic SPG48 (613647), Slabicki et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous 14-bp deletion (1413del14) in the KIAA04015
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination following
residue 56. No family members were available for study, and no copy
number variations were found on chromosome 7, but a second small change
affecting the KIAA0415 gene could not be completely excluded. The
mutation was not found in 158 Caucasian or 84 North African control
chromosomes.

611312	TITLE *611312 CORNULIN; CRNN
;;CHROMOSOME 1 OPEN READING FRAME 10; C1ORF10;;
PDRC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display PCR to compare genes expressed in esophageal
cancer tissues to those expressed in adjacent normal esophageal mucosa,
Xu et al. (2000) identified a differentially expressed transcript, which
they named C1ORF10. The C1ORF10 cDNA encodes a deduced 490-amino acid
protein with 1 transmembrane domain, an N-terminal EF-hand
calcium-binding motif of about 90 amino acids that shares 25 to 35%
identity to human S100 calcium-binding proteins (e.g., 114085), and a
conserved consecutive repeat sequence of about 60 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis of 16 human adult tissues revealed restricted expression
of an approximately 2.0-kb C1ORF10 transcript in esophagus. Expression
in esophageal cancer tissue was greatly reduced or absent compared to
the expression in matched adjacent normal esophageal mucosa.

Contzler et al. (2005) further characterized the C10ORF10 protein, which
they called cornulin. They found that the protein contains 2 EF-hand
domains in the N terminus and shares sequence and structural identity
with members of the 'fused protein' family (e.g., repetin) as well as
with members of the S100 protein family. RT-PCR analysis detected
expression of cornulin in fetal bladder, scalp skin, foreskin, and in
cultured primary keratinocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a Ca2+ overlay assay, Contzler et al. (2005) demonstrated that the
EF-hand domains of cornulin bind calcium. Confocal microscopy of HeLa
cells transfected with EGFP-labeled cornulin showed that cornulin was
distributed throughout the cytoplasm with denser staining occurring
around the nucleus; deletion of the EF-hand domains resulted in a
granular pattern of staining throughout the whole cell.
Immunofluorescence studies showed cornulin staining in the granular and
lower cornified cells of foreskin and also in the granular layer and
inner root sheath of the hair follicle in scalp skin; prominent staining
was observed on esophagus sections at the periphery of the cells of the
granular and the upper spinous layers. Because expression of cornulin
was especially high in Ca(2+)-differentiating cells, Contzler et al.
(2005) suggested that cornulin is a marker of late epidermal
differentiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (2000) determined that the C1ORF10 gene contains 3 exons, the
first of which is noncoding, and spans 5 kb.

Contzler et al. (2005) found that the gene structure of C1ORF10 is
similar to that of members of the 'fused gene' family. C1ORF10 has a
short first noncoding exon, a long intron 1, a second exon containing
the initiation codon and the first EF-hand motif, and a third exon
containing the second EF-hand motif.

MAPPING

Using a radiation hybrid panel, Xu et al. (2000) mapped the
C1ORf10/cornulin gene to human chromosome 1q21. By sequence analysis,
Contzler et al. (2005) mapped the gene within the epidermal
differentiation complex on 1q21, very close to other members of the
'fused gene' family.

609011	TITLE *609011 VASOHIBIN 1; VASH1
;;KIAA1036
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned VASH1, which they called KIAA1036.
The deduced protein contains 365 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
intermediate expression in adult heart, brain, lung, liver, kidney,
ovary, and spinal cord, as well as in fetal brain. Lower expression was
detected in skeletal muscle, testis, pancreas, and fetal liver, and
little to no expression was detected in spleen. All specific adult brain
regions examined showed low to moderate expression.

By microarray analysis, Watanabe et al. (2004) found that the KIAA1036
gene was upregulated in endothelial cells (ECs) by VEGF (192240), and
they renamed the gene vasohibin. The deduced vasohibin protein contains
a cluster of basic amino acids in its C terminus and no classic
secretion signal sequence. Northern blot analysis revealed prominent
expression in brain and placenta, and lower expression in heart and
kidney. Vasohibin expression was robust between embryonic weeks 6 to 12
in heart, brain, kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, and whole embryo.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected vasohibin at the endothelial layer
of placenta and brain. Western blot analysis detected vasohibin at an
apparent molecular mass of 42 kD in intact human umbilical vein ECs and
at 30 kD in the medium, indicating proteolytic processing during
secretion.

GENE FUNCTION

Following expression in insect cells, Watanabe et al. (2004) found that
recombinant vasohibin inhibited the migration, proliferation, and
network formation by ECs as well as angiogenesis in vivo. The inhibitory
effect was selective to ECs, as the protein did not affect the migration
of smooth muscle cells or fibroblasts. Eliminating the expression of
vasohibin in ECs restored their responsiveness to higher concentrations
of VEGF. Expression of vasohibin was selective to ECs, and hypoxia or
TNFA (191160) abrogated its inducible expression. Transfection of Lewis
lung carcinoma cells with the vasohibin gene did not affect the
proliferation of the cancer cells in vitro, but did inhibit tumor growth
and tumor angiogenesis in vivo in mice. Watanabe et al. (2004) concluded
that vasohibin is an endothelium-derived negative feedback regulator of
angiogenesis.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VASH1
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP RH80381).

188300	TITLE *188300 THYMIDINE KINASE, SOLUBLE; TK1
DESCRIPTION Thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21) catalyzes the phosphorylation of
thymidine to deoxythymidine monophosphate. Genetic variation in soluble
thymidine kinase has not been identified in man. Weiss and Green (1967)
found that fusion of mouse cells lacking this enzyme with normal human
cells could be achieved, that progressive loss of human chromosomes from
the hybrid occurred with passage of time, and that at a stage when only
one human chromosome remained the cell still had the capacity to
synthesize thymidine kinase. The assumption was that the remaining
chromosome, now identified as chromosome 17 (Migeon and Miller, 1968;
Miller et al., 1971), carries the TK locus. Boone et al. (1972)
presented evidence that TK is on the long arm of chromosome 17.
McDougall et al. (1973) showed that adeno-12 virus causes a gap in the
long arm of chromosome 17. Since the adeno-12 virus causes a 2- or
3-fold increase in TK, the gap may represent the TK locus and may be
comparable to a puff. By study of an 11-17 translocation in mouse-man
hybrid cells, Francke and Busby (1974) located the TK locus to the
region distal to q21. In the African green monkey, the thymidine kinase
and galactokinase (604313) loci are both on a chromosome similar to
human E-17 in size, shape and Giemsa banding pattern (Croce et al.,
1974). This is another striking example of chromosomal homology. Lin et
al. (1983) cloned the TK1 gene and estimated its maximal size to be 14
kilobase pairs and its minimal size between 4 and 5 kilobase pairs. The
gene contains many noncoding inserts and numerous Alu sequences.
Nucleotide sequencing indicated considerable evolutionary conservation
of the TK gene; Bradshaw and Deininger (1984) found about 70% homology
between the human and chicken genes. Flemington et al. (1987) sequenced
the entire 12.9-kb human TK gene, along with flanking regions. TK is
composed of 7 exons. Within the introns, 13 Alu family repeated
sequences and a polypyrimidine stretch were found. Sherley and Kelly
(1988) purified and characterized the enzyme from HeLa cells.
Kucherlapati et al. (1974) assigned the TK1 locus to 17q21-q22. By
chromosome-mediated gene transfer (CMGT), Klobutcher and Ruddle (1979)
transferred the genes for thymidine kinase, galactokinase, and type I
procollagen (120150). The data indicated the following gene order:
cen--GALK--(TK1--COL1A1). Studies by vanTuinen and Ledbetter (1987) led
to the conclusion that TK is located in the segment 17q23-qter, which is
consistent with the conclusion of Sparkes et al. (1986). Xu et al.
(1988) mapped the TK locus to 17q23-q25 by in situ hybridization. Xu et
al. (1988) also used CMGT in the generation of a physical map of
chromosome 17. This is an established method of constructing hybrid
cells containing subchromosomal fragments of a selected donor
chromosome. The generation of transfectants for chromosome 17 is helped
by the presence of the selectable marker TK. Xu et al. (1988) generated
a panel of more than 50 transfectants containing different transgenomic
fragments of chromosome 17. By analyzing cotransfection frequencies, Xu
et al. (1988) found groups of loci that are closely situated on
chromosome 17. Their results confirmed, however, that although
substantial lengths of DNA may be transferred intact, interstitial
deletions occur frequently. Furthermore, multiple fragments of
transfected chromatin can be found in the same clone, and there is
selection for centromeric sequences. Their overall results indicated the
following order:
pter--(TP53--POLR2--D17S1)--(MYHSA2--MYHSA1)--D17Z1--CRYB1--
(ERBA1--GCSF--NGL)--acute promyelocytic leukemia
breakpoint--RNU2--HOX2--
(NGFR--COL1A1--MPO)--GAA--UMPH--GHC--TK1--GALK--qter. In the 5-prime
flanking region of the TK gene, Sauve et al. (1990) located the position
of nucleotide sequences that can act as binding sites for transacting
factors as well as potential cis-acting sequences. The latter were
compared with those of the promoter of the human PCNA gene (176740).
Both TK and PCNA are maximally expressed at the G1/S boundary of the
cell cycle.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kuo et al. (1996) mapped both GAA
(232300) and the thymidine kinase gene to 17q25.2-q25.3 and showed that
GAA is distal to TK1.

604720	TITLE *604720 TRANSFERRIN RECEPTOR 2; TFR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While attempting to isolate genes encoding new transcriptional factors
from a TF-1 (erythroid leukemia) cell cDNA library, Kawabata et al.
(1999) cloned an 831-bp human cDNA fragment that had significant amino
acid homology to the middle portion of the classic transferrin receptor
protein (TFRC; 190010). Using 5-prime/3-prime RACE, they cloned a
full-length, 2.9-kb cDNA, which they designated TFR2. They identified 2
transcripts: a 2.9-kb transcript, called alpha, and an approximately
2.5-kb transcript, called beta, which was cloned from an HL60 (myeloid
leukemia) cell cDNA library. The alpha form predicts an 801-amino acid
type II membrane protein that shares 45% identity and 66% similarity in
its extracellular domain with TFRC. The beta form, which may be an
alternative product of splicing or promoter usage, lacks the
amino-terminal portion of TFR2-alpha, including the putative
transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis showed that the alpha form
is predominantly expressed in the liver and also in the K562
erythromegakaryocytic cell line; no expression of the beta form was
found. By RT-PCR analysis, TFR2-alpha was expressed in the liver,
spleen, lung, muscle, prostate, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
whereas expression of TFR-beta was found in all tissues tested.
Expression of human TFR2 conferred binding of holotransferrin and uptake
of transferrin-bound iron to a Chinese hamster ovary cell line lacking
endogenous TFRC. Kawabata et al. (1999) concluded that TFR2-alpha may be
a second transferrin receptor that can mediate cellular iron transport.

GENE FUNCTION

The majority of hepatic iron uptake under normal circumstances is
transferrin-mediated. However, expression of TFRC in hepatocytes, as in
other nonreticuloendothelial cell types, is downregulated in response to
increased intracellular iron. As a consequence, TFRC expression in liver
is undetectable in hereditary hemochromatosis (235200) patients with
hepatic iron loading. Nonetheless, hepatic iron loading in
hemochromatosis patients is progressive. Fleming et al. (2000) provided
support for a mechanism that involves the uptake of transferrin-bound
iron by TFR2. By screening a murine EST database for Tfrc sequences,
they identified a cDNA encoding a protein homologous to murine Tfrc.
They characterized the murine TFR2 ortholog and compared expression of
murine Tfrc and Tfr2 in normal mice, mice with iron deficiency, and mice
with iron overload. Unlike Tfrc, the Tfr2 transcript was highly
expressed in hepatocytes, was not regulated by tissue iron status, and
was not downregulated in a murine model of hereditary hemochromatosis.
From these observations, Fleming et al. (2000) proposed that TFR2
continues to mediate uptake of transferrin-bound iron by the liver after
TFRC is downregulated by iron overload, and thus may explain increased
susceptibility of the liver to iron loading in hereditary
hemochromatosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kawabata et al. (1999) determined the genomic structure of the TFR2
gene. The alpha transcript contains 18 exons. The beta transcript lacks
exons 1 through 3 and has an additional 142 bases at the 5-prime end of
exon 4.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kawabata et al. (1999) mapped the TFR2
gene to chromosome 7q22.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Camaschella et al. (2000) identified a premature termination mutation at
codon 250 in the TFR2 gene in homozygosity in a Sicilian family
segregating hemochromatosis type 3 (HFE3; 604250). The Y250X mutation
(604720.0001) identified by Camaschella et al. (2000) is located in a
region shared by both the alpha and beta transcripts of TFR2. A
phenotype of iron overload associated with the absence of the functional
gene suggested TFR2 is more likely involved in iron regulation rather
than iron uptake. Although TFR2 is highly expressed in an erythroid cell
line, none of the HFE3 patients that they studied showed erythrocyte
abnormalities. Rather, the patients tolerated long-term phlebotomies
without developing anemia. Thus, Camaschella et al. (2000) concluded
that TFR2, in contrast to TFRC, is not essential during erythroid
maturation.

Feder et al. (1996) found that about 15% of heriditary hemochromatosis
patients of northern European descent do not carry the C282Y mutation of
the HFE gene (613609.0001). Mattman et al. (2002) studied a group of
non-C282Y hemochromatosis patients and identified several sequence
variants, including a homozygous missense mutation in exon 17 of the
TFR2 gene, which resulted in a gln690-to-pro amino acid change
(604720.0005).

Hofmann et al. (2002) performed mutation analysis of the TFR2 gene in
patients with atypical hemochromatosis. They also questioned whether
differences in penetrance of the HFE C282Y mutation (613609.0001) were
associated with mutations in the TFR2 gene. They studied sib pairs
homozygous for cys282-to-tyr with a discordant phenotype. The most
common discordance between homozygous sibs was in serum transferrin
concentration. Many of these patients, however, also exhibited
significant differences in liver fibrosis and liver enzyme levels. They
also studied individuals who were not homozygous for C282Y with evidence
of iron excess, and other atypical groups. In a pair of brothers
homozygous for the C282Y mutation, they found an arg455-to-gln mutation
in TFR2 (604720.0004) only in the brother with liver fibrosis,
suggesting that TFR2 functions as a modifier for penetrance of the
hemochromatosis phenotype when present with homozygosity for C282Y.
Unlike TFR1 expression, TFR2 expression is not downregulated in the
liver of iron-loaded mice (Fleming et al., 2000). The screening for
mutations in all 18 exons indicated that mutations of the TFR2 gene are
rare.

ANIMAL MODEL

To characterize the role of TFR2 in iron homeostasis, Fleming et al.
(2002) generated a premature stop codon (Y245X), which was introduced by
targeted mutagenesis in the murine Tfr2 coding sequence. Codon 245 is
the mouse ortholog of codon 250, which is involved in the C250Y mutation
(604720.0001) of TFR2 in human hemochromatosis, and is located in a
region that is conserved between the mouse and human genomes. Fleming et
al. (2002) observed that by 4 weeks of age, mice homozygous for the
Y245X mutation developed periportal hepatic iron loading, splenic iron
sparing, and elevated serum transferrin saturations. Thus, the mutant
mice seemed to provide a faithful model for the abnormalities in iron
homeostasis observed in patients with loss of TFR2. Heterozygous mice
did not differ in any measured parameter from wildtype mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 3
TFR2, TYR250TER

In 2 families from Sicily who met diagnostic criteria for
hemochromatosis (604250) but were not linked to HFE, one of which was
consanguineous, Camaschella et al. (2000) identified a C-to-G
transversion in exon 6 at position 750 of the TFR2 cDNA sequence,
resulting in a tyrosine (TAC)-to-stop (TAG) substitution at residue 250
(Y250X). This substitution created a MaeI site. All affected members of
the consanguineous family were homozygous for Y250X, whereas obligate
carriers were heterozygous. One patient in the nonconsanguineous family
was homozygous for this mutation. Camaschella et al. (2000) did not find
the Y250X mutation in 100 normal chromosomes or in 12 hemochromatosis
patients who did not have mutations in HFE.

.0002
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 3
TFR2, 1-BP INS, 84C

In all affected members of a large inbred family in Campania in southern
Italy segregating hemochromatosis (604250), Roetto et al. (2001) found a
1-bp insertion of a cytosine residue in homozygous state in exon 2 in a
polyC tract (84-88 insC). The mutation resulted in a frameshift followed
by a premature stop codon, a glu60-to-ter (E60X) substitution. Because
of consanguinity, a pseudodominant pedigree pattern was observed in an
affected father and his 3 affected children in one branch of the family.
Heterozygosity was not associated with iron overload, even in
individuals also heterozygous for H63D (613609.0002) at the HFE locus or
for the beta-thalassemia trait.

.0003
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 3
TFR2, MET172LYS

In a family in which the proband had severe hemochromatosis (604250),
Roetto et al. (2001) found homozygosity for a T-to-A transversion
(515T-A) in exon 4 of TFR2 cDNA, resulting in a met172-to-lys (M172K)
substitution of the protein. The proband had cirrhosis, hypogonadism,
and cardiac disease. He had inherited beta-thalassemia in heterozygous
state from his mother.

.0004
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 1, MODIFIER OF
TFR2, ARG455GLN

Hofmann et al. (2002) studied 2 brothers who were homozygous for the
common hemochromatosis-causing mutation of the HFE gene, cys282 to tyr
(613609.0001). Direct nucleotide sequencing found a G-to-A transversion
at nucleotide 1391, resulting in an arg455-to-gln (R455Q) amino acid
change in the TFR2 gene. The R455Q mutation was present in only 1 of the
brothers homozygous for C282Y; that brother had evidence of liver
fibrosis, whereas the other brother did not.

.0005
HEMOCHROMATOSIS, TYPE 3
TFR2, GLN690PRO

In a Portuguese man with severe hemochromatosis (604250) and in 2 family
members, Mattman et al. (2002) found a gln690-to-pro (Q690P) mutation in
the TFR2 gene. The patient presented at 29 years of age with fatigue,
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hyperpigmentation, mild elevation of
liver transaminases, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. He had
markedly elevated serum iron indices and had had more than 12 g of iron
removed via phlebotomy in the previous 4 years. Additional hematologic
abnormalities included mild normocytic anemia and lymphopenia. He was
heterozygous for the H63D mutation in the HFE gene (613609.0002).
Mattman et al. (2002) stated that this patient was the only one of 89
non-C282Y hereditary chromatosis patients of predominately mixed
European descent in whom mutation of the TFR2 gene had been found.

600540	TITLE *600540 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR Sp4; SP4
;;HF1B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transcriptional regulation is exerted through protein factors that bind
to distinct DNA elements in the vicinity of target genes. Many control
elements are recognized by different members of transcription factor
families, opening combinatorial possibilities of the regulatory
interactions. Among the most widely distributed control elements are GC
boxes and related motifs bound by SP1 (189906). Hagen et al. (1992)
performed recognition site screening for factors which bind to the
uteroglobin promoter sequence GT box and cloned cDNAs encoding the
DNA-binding proteins SP3 (601804) and SP4, thus revealing the existence
of a multigene family of SP proteins. They found that SP1, SP3, and SP4
exhibit similar structural features: all contain DNA-binding domains
composed of 3 zinc fingers of the cys2/his2 type near the C terminus,
and all recognize GC- and GT-box sequences. Additionally, the N termini
of all 3 proteins are composed of long serine/threonine- and
glutamine-rich regions that have been identified in SP1 as
transactivation domains. Hagen et al. (1992) showed by Northern blot
analysis that SP4 is abundantly expressed as a 7.5-kb message in brain,
but barely detectable in other human cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Hagen et al. (1995) used cotransfection experiments to show that SP4 is
an activator protein like SP1. However, in contrast to SP1, they found
that SP4 is not able to act synergistically through adjacent binding
sites.

Hirose and Horvitz (2013) showed that the C. elegans Sp1 transcription
factor SPTF3, which is most similar to human SP4, specifies the
programmed cell deaths of at least 2 cells, the sisters of the
pharyngeal M4 motor neuron and the AQR sensory neuron, by
transcriptionally activating both caspase-dependent and -independent
apoptotic pathways. SPTF3 directly drives the transcription of the gene
egl-1, which encodes a BH3-only protein that promotes apoptosis through
the activation of the CED3 caspase. In addition, SPTF3 directly drives
the transcription of the AMP-activated protein kinase-related gene
pig-1, which encodes a protein kinase closely related to mammalian MELK
(607025), and functions in apoptosis of the M4 sister and AQR sister
independently of the pathway that activated CED3. Hirose and Horvitz
(2013) concluded that a single transcription factor controls 2 distinct
cell-killing programs that act in parallel to drive apoptosis.

MAPPING

Kalff-Suske et al. (1995) assigned the SP4 gene to human chromosome 7
using Southern blot hybridization to a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid
panel. Subsequently, they narrowed the assignment to 7p21-p13 by PCR
amplification of genomic template DNA from somatic cell hybrids
containing fragments of this chromosome. The chromosomal localization
was further refined by fluorescence in situ hybridization to 7p15. The
previous assignment of the SP1 gene to chromosome 12q13, together with
the assignment of the SP4 gene to chromosome 7p15, increases the number
of known paralogous relationships between human chromosomes 7 and 12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nguyen-Tran et al. (2000) reported that mice deficient in Hf1b/Sp4
survived to term and exhibited normal cardiac structure and function but
displayed sudden cardiac death and a complete penetrance of conduction
system defects, including spontaneous ventricular tachycardia and a high
incidence of AV block. Continuous electrocardiographic recordings
clearly documented cardiac arrhythmogenesis as the cause of death.
Single-cell analysis revealed an anatomic substrate for
arrhythmogenesis, including a decrease and mislocalization of connexins
and a marked increase in action potential heterogeneity. Two independent
markers revealed defects in the formation of ventricular Purkinje
fibers. The authors concluded that these studies identified a novel
genetic pathway for sudden cardiac death via defects in the transition
between ventricular and conduction system cell lineages.

Gollner et al. (2001) found that Sp4 knockout mice, with a complete
absence of Sp4 expression due to targeted deletion of the exons encoding
the N-terminal activation domains, showed a complex phenotype. They
developed until birth without obvious abnormalities. After birth,
two-thirds died within 4 weeks. Surviving mice were growth retarded.
Males homozygous for the null mutation did not breed; the reason for
this remained obscure since they showed complete spermatogenesis, and
pheromone receptor genes in the vomeronasal organ appeared unaffected.
Female null mice had a smaller thymus, spleen, and uterus and exhibited
a pronounced delay in sexual maturation. Thus, the phenotype of the
Sp4-null mice differed significantly from those described for the Sp1-
and Sp3-null mice. The authors concluded that the structural
similarities, the common recognition motif, and the overlapping
expression pattern of these 3 transcription factors do not reflect
similar physiologic functions.

Zhou et al. (2010) stated that mice with hypomorphic Sp4 expression
display subtle vacuolization of the hippocampus and deficits in
sensorimotor gating and contextual memory. They found that Sp4
hypomorphic mice also showed deficits in spatial learning and memory.
Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of Sp4 hypomorphic brain
revealed reduced protein expression of the NMDA receptor subunit Nr1
(GRIN1; 138249) in hippocampus and cortex. No difference was observed in
expression of the 4 Nr2 proteins (e.g., GRIN2A; 138253), and RT-PCR
detected no difference in Nr1 mRNA levels between Sp4 hypomorphic and
wildtype hippocampus. Zhou et al. (2010) suggested that the Sp4
hypomorphic mouse may represent a novel hypoglutamatergic model for
psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (see 181500).

609548	TITLE *609548 LMAN1-LIKE PROTEIN; LMAN1L
;;ERGIC53-LIKE PROTEIN; ERGL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences highly expressed in prostate,
Yerushalmi et al. (2001) identified LMAN1L, which they called ERGL. The
deduced 527-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence,
followed by a long extracellular lectin domain, a transmembrane domain,
and a short intracellular domain. ERGL has 1 possible glycosylation site
and 2 possible intracellular phosphorylation sites. The lectin and
transmembrane domains of ERGL share significant similarity with ERGIC53
(LMAN1; 601567). Northern blot analysis detected a strong, broad signal
between 4.4 and 7.5 kb in prostate and spleen, but not in other tissues.
Weaker but distinct 1.8- and 2.0-kb transcripts were detected in
prostate, and a 1.8-kb transcript was detected in spleen. RNA dot blot
analysis showed strongest ERGL expression in prostate, spleen, salivary
gland, and cardiac atrium. Weaker expression was observed in cerebellum,
spinal cord, appendix, adrenal gland, fetal spleen, and testis. PCR
analysis revealed 2 splice variants in prostate and a single variant in
salivary gland and spleen. In situ hybridization detected ERGL in normal
and neoplastic prostate epithelial cells, in acinar and duct epithelial
cells of salivary gland, in neurons and astrocytes of cerebral cortex,
in Purkinje cells of cerebellum, in motor neurons of the spinal cord
ventral horn, and in marginal zones of B-cell follicles in spleen.
Diffuse ERGL expression was detected in cardiac atrial muscle sarcoplasm
and in isolated subendocardial cells, but not in cardiac ventricles.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Yerushalmi et al. (2001) mapped the LMAN1L
gene to chromosome 15q22-q23.

612960	TITLE *612960 EPITHELIAL SPLICING REGULATORY PROTEIN 2; ESRP2
;;RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 35B; RBM35B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ESPR2 is an epithelial cell-type-specific splicing regulator (Warzecha
et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using a cell-based cDNA expression screen with human embryonic kidney
293T cells, Warzecha et al. (2009) identified mouse Esrp1 (612959) and
Esrp2 as regulators of FGFR2 (176943) splicing. By database analysis,
they identified human ESRP2, which encodes a deduced protein containing
3 central RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Comparison of ESRP orthologs in
diverse species showed significant sequence conservation within the RRM
domains, particularly RRM1. In mouse embryos, expression of Esrp2
appeared to be specific to epithelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Cell type-specific expression of epithelial and mesenchymal isoforms of
FGFR2 is achieved through tight regulation of mutually exclusive exons
IIIb and IIIc, respectively. Warzecha et al. (2009) showed that
expression of epitope-tagged mouse Esrp1 or Esrp2 in 293T cells induced
a substantial switch of endogenous FGFR2 transcripts from the
mesenchymal form with exon IIIc to the epithelial form with exon IIIb.
Microarray analysis revealed that cell lines classified as epithelial
expressed higher levels of ESRP1 and/or ESRP2 than cell lines classified
as mesenchymal. Depletion of ESRP1 and ESRP2 in a human prostate
epithelial cell line via RNA interference (RNAi) caused a significant
switch from exon IIIb to exon IIIc splicing in the endogenous FGFR2
transcript. Rescue experiments with mouse cDNAs showed that FGFR2-IIIb
splicing was more dependent on ESRP1 than ESRP2. RNAi experiments
revealed that ESRP1 and ESRP2 also regulated splicing of CD44 (107269),
CTNND1 (601045), and ENAH (609061), transcripts that undergo changes in
splicing during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the ESRP2 gene to chromosome 16q22.1 based on an
alignment of the ESRP2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025571) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;KIAA1284;;
PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING 6; PDZK6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned INTU, which they designated
KIAA1284. The deduced 953-amino acid protein contains a PDZ domain.
RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in kidney, ovary, and fetal
brain, intermediate expression in heart, adult brain, liver, lung, and
skeletal muscle, and little to no expression in pancreas, spleen, and
fetal liver. INTU was expressed in all specific adult brain regions
examined with highest levels in amygdala, corpus callosum, caudate
nucleus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and spinal cord.

By in situ hybridization of Xenopus embryos, Park et al. (2006) found
that Xint, the frog homolog of INTU, was expressed in the neural plate
during neural tube closure, with subsequent strong expression in the
ventral neural tube and in facial mesenchyme.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the INTU gene
to chromosome 4. By genomic sequence analysis, Park et al. (2006) mapped
the INTU gene to chromosome 4q28.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using an antisense morpholino-oligonucleotide, Park et al. (2006)
disrupted Xint expression in Xenopus embryos. Knockdown of Xint
disrupted Hedgehog (600725) signaling and caused defects in neural tube
closure, including exencephaly, spina bifida, and holoprosencephaly-like
features. The authors found that the Hedgehog defect in Xint-deficient
embryos was secondary to a failure of ciliogenesis and that Xint and
Fuzzy (FUZ; 610622) controlled the assembly of an apical actin network
that is essential for the normal orientation of ciliary microtubules.
Fluorescence microscopy revealed colocalization of Xint and Dishevelled
(601365) at the apical surface of ciliated Xenopus epidermal cells. Park
et al. (2006) concluded that Inturned, Fuzzy, and Dishevelled regulate
ciliogenesis in Hedgehog-responsive cells through a conserved planar
cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Homeobox genes act as master genes that control pattern formation and
positional information during embryonic development. In the adult, they
are thought to maintain the differentiated states of cell populations
and to direct the renewal of specific cell types. While homeobox genes
are widely expressed in the developing vertebrate nervous system, only a
few, including NKX6B, continue to be expressed in the adult brain
(summary by Lee et al., 2001).

CLONING

Nkx6.2 was isolated in mouse by Komuro et al. (1993). Expression of
Nkx6.2 appeared to be tissue specific and developmentally regulated. In
day-18 mouse embryos, it was expressed in part of the forebrain as well
as in mid- and hindbrain, whereas in the adult CNS, expression was most
abundant in areas rich in oligodendrocyte cell bodies and astrocytes.
Together with DNA binding assays, these expression studies suggested
that the Nkx6.2 gene product may be important for differentiated
oligodendrocyte function and in the regulation of myelin gene
expression.

Lee et al. (2001) cloned and characterized NKX6B, the human homolog of
mouse Nkx6.2. The predicted 277-amino acid NKX6B protein shares 97%
identity with mouse Nkx6.2 and 52% homology with NKX6A (602563).
Northern blot analysis showed that NKX6B expression is tightly
controlled in a tissue-specific fashion, with highest expression in
brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

By DNA sequence analysis of an 11-kb genomic fragment, Lee et al. (2001)
demonstrated that the NKX6B gene spans 1.2 kb and contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

Using STS content mapping and radiation hybrid analysis, Lee et al.
(2001) mapped NKX6B gene to 10q26, a region where loss of heterozygosity
has frequently been observed in various malignant brain tumors. Lee et
al. (2001) suggested that NKX6B may be a tumor suppressor gene for brain
tumors, particularly for oligodendrogliomas.

Komuro et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Nkx6b gene to the distal portion
of chromosome 7.

603369	TITLE *603369 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE INHIBITOR 2C; CDKN2C
;;p18(INK4C)
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) are a group of low molecular
weight proteins that associate with cyclin-CDK complexes or CDKs alone
and inhibit their activity. Members of the INK4 family of CKIs, which
includes CDKN2C, specifically bind and inhibit CDK4 (123829) and CDK6
(603368), thereby preventing cyclin D-dependent phosphorylation of RB1
(614041). See INK4D (600947).

CLONING

By using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to search for CDK6-interacting
proteins, Guan et al. (1994) isolated a partial cDNA encoding a protein
that they designated p18 based on its molecular mass of 18 kD. They used
the partial cDNA to screen a HeLa cell library and recovered additional
cDNAs corresponding to the entire p18 coding region. Sequence analysis
revealed that the predicted 168-amino acid p18 protein shares 38% and
42% sequence identity with p16/INK4A (600160) and p14/INK4B (600431),
respectively. Like p14 and p16, p18 contains an ankyrin repeat domain.
Using Northern blot analysis, Guan et al. (1994) found that p18 is
expressed as multiple transcripts in various human tissues, with the
strongest expression in skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Guan et al. (1994) showed that, both in vivo and in vitro, p18
interacted strongly with CDK6 and weakly with CDK4, but not with the
other CDKs tested. Recombinant p18 inhibited the kinase activity of
cyclin D-CDK6 in vitro. Ectopic expression of either p16 or p18
suppressed the growth of human cells in a manner that appears to
correlate with the presence of a wildtype RB1 function.

GENE STRUCTURE

Blais et al. (1998) determined that the p18, or INK4C, gene contains 3
exons and spans more than 7.5 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Guan et al. (1994) mapped the p18
gene to 1p32, a chromosomal region associated with abnormalities in a
variety of human tumors.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lapointe et al. (1996) identified a single amino acid substitution
(ala72 to pro; A72P) in BT-20 human breast cancer cells that abrogated
the ability of p18 to interact with CDK6 and to suppress cell growth.
These authors suggested that p18 inactivation by point mutations may
contribute to deregulated growth control in certain cell lines and/or
tumors. Blais et al. (1998) found this p18 variant in 3 of 35 breast
tumors examined, and suggested that it may be a polymorphism.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zindy et al. (2001) determined that both Ink4c and Ink4d were expressed
in the seminiferous tubules of postnatal wildtype mice, being largely
confined to postmitotic spermatocytes undergoing meiosis. Loss of either
Ink4c or Ink4d alone was associated with male fertility, but
double-knockout males were sterile. Spermatogonia did not differentiate
properly and became apoptotic. Residual spermatozoa had reduced motility
and decreased viability. Loss of Ink4c alone or in combination with loss
of Ink4d was associated with impaired differentiation of Leydig cells
and reduced testosterone levels, but there was no effect on the levels
of luteinizing hormone produced by the anterior pituitary. Loss of Ink4c
or Ink4d, either singly or in combination, had no effect on female
reproductive function.

Bai et al. (2003) noted that targeted disruption of Ink4c in mice leads
to spontaneous pituitary tumors and lymphomas later in life. Treatment
of Inc4c null and heterozygous mice with a chemical carcinogen resulted
in tumor development at an accelerated rate. Bai et al. (2003) concluded
that, since the remaining wildtype allele of Ink4c was neither mutated
nor silenced in tumors derived from heterozygotes, Ink4c is a
haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in mice.

Using reconstituted mice with p18-deficient hematopoietic cells and in
vivo evaluation of stem cell function, Yuan et al. (2004) found that p18
inhibited cell division in hematopoietic stem cells and early
hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Nmyc (164840) promotes rapid cell division of granule neuron progenitors
(GNPs) in mice, and its conditional loss during embryonic cerebellar
development results in severe GNP deficiency, perturbs foliation, and
leads to reduced cerebellar mass. Since Nmyc loss triggers precocious
expression of Kip1 (CDKN1B; 600778) and Ink4c in the cerebellar
primordium, Zindy et al. (2006) disrupted Kip1 and Ink4c in Nmyc-null
cerebella and found that this partially rescued GNP cell proliferation
and cerebellar foliation. They concluded that expression of NMYC and
concomitant downregulation of INK4C and KIP1 contribute to the proper
development of the cerebellum.

611782	TITLE *611782 DOWN SYNDROME CELL ADHESION MOLECULE-LIKE 1; DSCAML1
;;DSCAM-LIKE 1;;
KIAA1132
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) obtained a partial cDNA encoding
DSCAML1, which they designated KIAA1132. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate
expression in adult and fetal brain and in all specific adult brain
regions examined. Low expression was detected in kidney and ovary, and
little to no expression was detected in all other tissues examined.

Agarwala et al. (2001) cloned full-length DSCAML1 by screening a fetal
brain cDNA library with the partial KIAA1132 cDNA. The deduced
2,053-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 224 kD. It
has a 1,573-amino acid extracellular domain, a 21-amino acid
transmembrane domain, and a 441-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. The
extracellular domain contains 10 Ig C2-type domains, 6 fibronectin (see
135600) type III domains, 15 N-glycosylation sites, an RGD-type cell
attachment sequence, and a carboxypeptidase (see CPA1; 114850)
zinc-binding region-2. The cytoplasmic domain contains 7 putative
phosphorylation sites and 6 N-myristoylation sites. The domain
structures of DSCAML1 and DSCAM (602523) are identical, and they share
64% and 45% amino acid identity in their extracellular and cytoplasmic
domains, respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.6-kb
transcript in fetal and adult brain and in all adult brain sections
examined, except amygdala. A weak signal was detected in adult kidney.
Northern blot analysis of whole mouse embryos detected expression at 17
days postcoitum and in all postnatal stages tested. In adult mouse,
expression was detected only in brain. In situ hybridization revealed
Dscaml1 in the Purkinje cell layer of mouse cerebellum, in granule cells
of the dentate gyrus and in pyramidal cells of the CA1 and CA3 regions
of the hippocampus, and in olfactory bulb, with moderate expression in
cerebral cortex and thalamus. Immunohistochemical analysis of
transfected mouse fibroblasts and rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells showed
expression on the cell surface. In differentiated transfected PC12
cells, human DSCAML1 associated with axons, but not with dendrites.
Southern blot analysis suggested that DSCAML1 is highly conserved in
vertebrates.

By RT-PCR of adult human brain, Barlow et al. (2002) identified DSCAML1
splice variants lacking either exon 3 or 4, resulting in removal of
either the N- or C- terminal half of the Ig2 domain, respectively.
Barlow et al. (2002) noted that their full-length DSCAML1 cDNA has an
in-frame ATG 180 bp upstream of the translational start site reported by
Agarwala et al. (2001), resulting in a 60-amino acid N-terminal
extension to the protein. Northern blot analysis detected several
DSCAML1 splice variants in all human adult tissues examined. The 7.5-kb
transcript was expressed predominantly in brain, but was also present in
kidney, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and lung, along with smaller
variants. Expression was detected in all adult brain regions examined,
including amygdala. Mouse tissues showed an expression pattern
significantly different than that in human.

GENE FUNCTION

Agarwala et al. (2001) found that mouse cells expressing human DSCAML1
adhered to each other in large aggregates. Aggregation was mediated by
homophilic interactions between DSCAML1 molecules expressed on the cell
surface and did not require calcium.

Yamagata and Sanes (2008) demonstrated that 4 closely related
immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) adhesion molecules--Dscam (602523),
DscamL, Sidekick-1 (SDK1; 607216), and SDK2 (607217)--are expressed in
chick by nonoverlapping subsets of interneurons and retinal ganglion
cells that form synapses in distinct inner plexiform layer (IPL)
sublaminae. Moreover, each protein is concentrated within the
appropriate sublaminae and each mediates homophilic adhesion. Loss- and
gain-of-function studies in vivo indicated that these IgSF members
participate in determining the inner plexiform layer sublaminae in which
synaptic partners arborize and connect. Thus, vertebrate Dscams, like
Drosophila Dscams, play roles in neural connectivity. Yamagata and Sanes
(2008) concluded that, taken together, their results on Dscams and
Sidekicks suggested the existence of an IgSF code for laminar
specificity in retina and, by implication, in other parts of the central
nervous system.

GENE STRUCTURE

Agarwala et al. (2001) determined that the DSCAML1 gene contains at
least 32 exons. Barlow et al. (2002) identified 33 exons in DSCAML1.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hirosawa et al. (1999) mapped the DSCAML1
gene to chromosome 11. Using FISH, Agarwala et al. (2001) mapped the
human DSCAML1 gene to chromosome 11q23 and the mouse Dscaml1 gene to
chromosome 9B.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FCGR3, or CD16) is encoded by
2 nearly identical genes, FCGR3A (146740) and FCGR3B, resulting in
tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.
FCGR3A encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on activated
monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subset of T
cells. In contrast, FCGR3B encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed constitutively by neutrophils
and after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) stimulation by eosinophils
(summary by Gessner et al., 1995).

CLONING

Ory et al. (1989) reported the cDNA sequences encoding the NA1 and NA2
forms of FCGR3 on neutrophils, which are encoded by the FCGR3B gene.

By Western blot and flow cytometric analyses, Ravetch and Perussia
(1989) demonstrated differential expression of FCGR3 on
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and NK cells. The glycoprotein on
NK cells (FCGR3A) had a molecular mass 6 to 10 kD larger than that on
neutrophils (FCGR3B) and was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C. Transcripts derived from FCGR3A and FCGR3B in NK cells
and PMNs, respectively, have multiple single nucleotide differences,
including 1 that converts a termination codon to a codon encoding arg,
thereby extending the cytoplasmic domain by 21 amino acids and
introducing a transmembrane anchor for FCGR3A in NK cells. The deduced
FCGR3A protein contains 254 amino acids, whereas the deduced FCGR3B
protein contains 233 amino acids. Ravetch and Perussia (1989) concluded
that cell type-specific expression of 2 genes encoding alternative FCGR3
proteins has a significant effect on the biologic functions of the
molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gessner et al. (1995) isolated and sequenced genomic clones of FCGR3A
and FCGR3B, located their transcription initiation sites, identified the
different organizations of their 5-prime regions, and demonstrated 4
distinct classes of FCGR3A transcripts compared with a single class of
FCGR3B transcripts. The gene promoters displayed different
tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting expression of
FCGR3A in NK cells and FCGR3B in neutrophils.

MAPPING

By spot blot analysis, Grundy et al. (1989) mapped the FCGR2A (146790)
and FCGR2B genes, which are separated by about 200 kb, to chromosome 1q.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Sondermann et al. (2000) described the crystal structures of a soluble
FCGR3 (CD16B), an Fc fragment from human IgG1 (Fc1), and their complex.
In the 1:1 complex, the receptor binds to the 2 halves of the Fc
fragment in contact with residues of the C-gamma-2 domains and the hinge
region. Upon complex formation, the angle between the 2 soluble CD16B
domains increases significantly and the Fc fragment opens
asymmetrically. The high degree of amino acid conservation between
soluble CD16B and other Fc receptors, and similarly between Fc1 and
related immunoglobulins, suggested similar structures and modes of
association.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Genetic polymorphism of Fc receptor III on neutrophils is detectable by
several means, including reaction with antibodies against the biallelic
neutrophil-specific antigen system NA; differences in electrophoretic
mobility on SDS-PAGE; and differences in mRNAs encoding the allelic
forms of Fc receptor III. Ory et al. (1989) described the relationship
between structural and antigenic polymorphisms of FCGR3B and showed that
these reflect differences at the level of primary protein structure.

In a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700), Clark et
al. (1990) found that neutrophils were not recognized by either
monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to Fc receptor III, but reacted
normally with antibodies to Fc receptor II (FCGR2A), as well as with
antibodies to complement receptor-1, complement receptor-3 (120980), and
decay-accelerating factor (DAF; 125240). Analysis of genomic DNA showed
that failure of the patient's neutrophils to express Fc receptor III was
most likely due to an abnormality of the gene encoding the receptor.

Huizinga et al. (1990) described a case of neonatal isoimmune
neutropenia in which the mother was completely lacking FcRIII (CD16) on
neutrophils, but normal expression of FcRIII on natural killer cells.
The mother had isoantibodies in her blood against CD16 antigen,
apparently produced during pregnancy and responsible for the neutropenia
in her child. Fc receptor III is encoded by 2 separate genes: FcRIII-1,
which encodes the neutrophil receptor, and FcRIII-2, which encodes the
transmembrane receptor on natural killer cells and macrophages. The
neutrophil FcRIII deficiency appeared to be due to deletion of the
FcRIII-1 gene, while the FcRIII-2 gene was normally present. Her parents
were found to be heterozygous for the defect.

Neutrophil-specific antigens have been identified in the course of study
of isoimmune neonatal neutropenia due to fetomaternal incompatibility.
(Since it occurs in multiple sibs, neonatal neutropenia might simulate a
recessive disorder.) Two loci, termed NA and NB (162860), were
identified (Lalezari and Radel, 1974), with 2 alleles known at the NA
locus. These are NA1 and NA2 and have a frequency of 0.377 and 0.633,
respectively, in Caucasians and 0.651 in 0.302, respectively, in
Japanese (Ohto and Matsuo, 1989). The 'NA-null' status of the mother
reported by Huizinga et al. (1990) indicated that CD16 and NA are the
same molecule. Fromont et al. (1992) described a healthy woman who after
multiple pregnancies developed an antibody directed against CD16 which
caused transient neonatal alloimmune neutropenia (NAIN). The woman's
polymorphonuclear leukocytes did not react with monoclonal NA1 and NA2
antibodies, indicating the NA-null phenotype. Fromont et al. (1992)
determined that in a healthy, white population of 3,377 random blood
donors there were only 4 other instances of the NA-null phenotype. Their
proposita was the only one with an allo-CD16 antibody. The gene
frequency was calculated to be 0.0274 +/- 0.0059.

The neutrophil-specific antigen NC1 was defined by an antibody (Vaz) in
the serum of a multiparous mother who gave birth to a child with
alloimmune neonatal neutropenia (Lalezari et al., 1970). This antigen
has a gene frequency of about 0.80 (Lalezari et al., 1970). NC1 was
found to be associated with the neutrophil-specific antigen NA2,
although the precise relationship of NC1 and NA2 was unclear. Using the
antigen capture assay MAIGA and the granulocyte (GIFT) and lymphocyte
(LIFT) immunofluorescence tests, Bux et al. (1995) obtained results
indicating that NC1 and NA2 antigens are identical.

Aitman et al. (2006) showed that copy number variation (CNV) of the
orthologous rat and human Fcgr3 (FCGR3A; 146740) genes is a determinant
of susceptibility to immunologically mediated glomerulonephritis.
Positional cloning identified loss of the rat-specific Fcgr3 paralog
'Fcgr3-related sequence' (Fcgr3rs) as a determinant of macrophage
overactivity and glomerulonephritis in Wistar Kyoto rats. In humans, low
copy number of FCGR3B, an ortholog of rat Fcgr3, was associated with
glomerulonephritis in the autoimmune disorder SLE. Aitman et al. (2006)
concluded that their finding that gene CNV predisposes to
immunologically mediated renal disease in 2 mammalian species provides
direct evidence for the importance of genome plasticity in the evolution
of genetically complex phenotypes, including susceptibility to common
human disease.

Following up on the study of Aitman et al. (2006) in a larger sample,
Fanciulli et al. (2007) confirmed and strengthened their previous
finding of an association between low FCGR3B copy number and
susceptibility to glomerulonephritis in SLE patients. Low copy number
was also associated with risk of systemic SLE with no known renal
involvement as well as with microscopic polyangiitis and Wegener
granulomatosis (608710), but not with organ- specific Graves disease
(275000) or Addison disease (240200), in British and French cohorts.
Fanciulli et al. (2007) concluded that low FCGR3B copy number or
complete FCGR3B deficiency has a key role in the development of specific
autoimmunity.

Willcocks et al. (2008) confirmed that low copy number of FCGR3B was
associated with SLE (152700) in a Caucasian U.K. population, but they
were unable to find an association in a Chinese population.
Investigations of the functional effects of FCGR3B CNV revealed that
FCGR3B CNV correlated with cell surface expression, soluble FCGR3B
production, and neutrophil adherence to and uptake of immune complexes
both in a patient family and in the general population. Willcocks et al.
(2008) found that individuals from 3 U.K. cohorts with antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibody-associated systemic vasculitis (AASV) were more
likely to have high FCGR3B CNV. They proposed that FCGR3B CNV is
involved in immune complex clearance, possibly explaining the
association of low CNV with SLE and high CNV with AASV.

Among 1,115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) and 654
controls, Robinson et al. (2012) found a significant association between
FCGR3B deletions and disease (OR = 1.50, p = 0.028). The association was
more apparent in rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive disease (OR = 1.61, p =
0.011). Robinson et al. (2012) noted that the general association (p =
0.028) would not remain significant if corrected for multiple testing,
but the evidence was strengthened by the stronger association in the
RF-positive group of patients. The level of FCGR3B expression on
neutrophils was shown to correlate with gene copy number. The results
implicated an important role for neutrophils in the pathogenesis of RA,
potentially through reduced FCGR3B-mediated immune complex clearance.
The authors used a novel quantitative sequence variant assay in the
study.

In a metaanalysis of 8 published studies examining the association of
FCGR3B CNVs in autoimmune diseases, McKinney and Merriman (2012) found
that low (less than 2) gene copy number was associated with SLE (OR of
1.59, p = 9.1 x 10(-7)), but not with rheumatoid arthritis (OR of 1.36,
p = 0.15). A combined autoimmune phenotype analysis, including
vasculitis, ulcerative colitis (see 266600), Kawasaki disease (611775),
and other disorders, supported FCGR3B deletions as a risk factor for
non-organ-specific autoimmunity (OR = 1.44, p = 2.9 x 10(-9)). The
findings implicated defects in the clearance of immune complexes in the
etiology of non-organ-specific autoimmune disease.

Mueller et al. (2013) found that the increased risk of SLE associated
with reduced copy number of FCGR3B can be explained by the presence of a
chimeric gene, FCGR2B-prime, that occurs as a consequence of FCGR3B
deletion on FCGR3B zero-copy haplotypes. The FCGR2B-prime gene consists
of upstream elements and a 5-prime coding region that derive from FCGR2C
(612169), and a 3-prime coding region that derives from FCGR2B (604590).
The coding sequence of FCGR2B-prime is identical to that of FCGR2B, but
FCGR2B-prime would be expected to be under the control of 5-prime
flanking sequences derived from FCGR2C. Mueller et al. (2013) found by
flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and cDNA sequencing that presence of the
chimeric FCGR2B-prime gene results in the ectopic presence of
Fc-gamma-RIIb on natural killer cells, providing an explanation for SLE
risk associated with reduced FCGR3B copy number. To pursue the
underlying mechanism of SLE disease association with FCGR3B copy number
variation, Mueller et al. (2013) aligned the reference sequence (GRCh37)
of the proximal block of the FCGR locus (chr1:161,480,906-161,564,008)
to that of the distal block (chr1:161,562,570-161,645,839).
Identification of informative paralogous sequence variants (PSVs)
enabled Mueller et al. (2013) to narrow the potential breakpoint region
to a 24.5-kb region of paralogy between then 2 ancestral duplicated
blocks. The complete absence of nonpolymorphic PSVs in the 24.5-kb
region prevented more precise localization of the breakpoints in
FCGR3B-deleted or FCGR3B-duplicated haplotypes.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) found that Fcrg (FCER1G; 147139) -/-
mice showed reduced mortality in an acute peritonitis model caused by
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with wildtype mice. The
reduced mortality in Fcrg -/- mice was associated with lower serum and
peritoneal Tnf (191160) and significantly increased capacity of
neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose E. coli. Mice lacking Fcgr3
(the only Fcgr3 gene in mice) also had reduced sepsis after CLP. Fcgr3
bound E. coli, inducing Fcrg phosphorylation, recruitment of tyrosine
phosphatase Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883), and dephosphorylation of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 171834). Decreased Pi3k
activity inhibited E. coli phagocytosis and increased Tnf production
through Tlr4 (603030). Confocal microscopy demonstrated negative
regulation of Marco (604870) by Fcrg. Interaction of E. coli with Fcgr3
induced recruitment of Shp1 to Marco and inhibited E. coli phagocytosis.
Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) concluded that binding of E. coli to
FCGR3 triggers an inhibitory FCRG pathway that impairs MARCO-mediated
bacterial clearance and activates TNF secretion.

FCGR3B, ARG36SER, ASN65SER, ASP82ASN, AND VAL106ILE

Ory et al. (1989) found nucleotide changes in the FCGR3B gene predicting
4 amino acid differences between the NA1 and NA2 alloantigens of
neutrophils involved in alloimmune neonatal neutropenia. As a result,
NA1 FCGR3 has only 4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites compared
with 6 in NA2 FCGR3. In addition, Ory et al. (1989) found a silent
nucleotide change at codon 38: CTC (leu38) in NA1; CTT (leu38) in NA2.

611993	TITLE *611993 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S33; MRPS33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS33
is a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS33. The deduced 106-amino acid MRPS33 protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 12.6 kD. Removal of a predicted 26-amino
acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal results in a mature
9.7-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified MRPS33 orthologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast or E. coli. Mouse and human
MRPS33 share 80.2% amino acid identity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang and Gerstein (2003) determined that the MRPS33 gene has no introns
in its coding region.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003) mapped the
MRPS33 gene to chromosome 7q32-q34. They identified 4 MRPS33 pseudogenes
scattered throughout the genome.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) functions as a neuromodulator and/or trophic
factor in the central nervous system. Glutathione (GSH)-independent PGD
synthase catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to PGD2 in
the presence of various sulfhydryl compounds. The enzyme is responsible
for biosynthesis of PGD2 in the brain (Nagata et al., 1991).

CLONING

Nagata et al. (1991) isolated cDNAs for GSH-independent PGD2 synthase
from cDNA libraries of human brain. The longest insert contained a
coding region of 570 basepairs corresponding to 190 amino acid residues
with a calculated molecular mass of 21,016.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanaka et al. (1997) analyzed the binding of recombinant rat brain Ptgds
to retinoids by measuring fluorescence, UV, and circular dichroism
spectra after incubation of Ptgds with various isoforms of retinoid.
They found that Ptgds binds all-trans-retinoic acid, 9-cis-retinoic
acid, all-trans-retinal, and 13-cis-retinal, but not all-trans-retinol,
with affinities sufficient for function as a retinoid transporter.
All-trans-retinoic acid inhibited Ptgds activity in a noncompetitive
manner, suggesting that it binds to the same hydrophobic pocket as PGH2,
the substrate for Ptgds, but at a different site in this pocket. Tanaka
et al. (1997) suggested that PTGDS is a bifunctional protein that acts
as both a retinoid transporter and a PGD2-producing enzyme.

Kanekiyo et al. (2007) detected PTGDS within amyloid plaques in the
brain of a human patient with late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300)
and in mouse models of AD. In vitro studies showed that human PTGDS
inhibited the aggregation of beta-amyloid (APP; 104760) fibrils in a
dose-dependent manner. Ptgds-knockout mice showed acceleration of brain
beta-amyloid deposition, and transgenic mice overexpressing human PTGDS
showed decreased amyloid deposition, compared to wildtype. Since PTGDS
is present in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), Kanekiyo et al. (2007)
concluded that PTGDS acts as an endogenous beta-amyloid chaperone by
binding to a particular area of APP and preventing a conformational
shape change from soluble to insoluble peptides. The findings suggested
that quantitative or qualitative changes in PTGDS may be involved in the
pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.

Both SRY (480000) and SOX9 (608160) are necessary for testis development
in humans and mice. Prostaglandin D2 contributes to the development of
the testis by recruiting cells of the supporting cell lineage to a
Sertoli cell fate (Wilhelm et al., 2005). Wilhelm et al. (2007) found
that Pgds was expressed in embryonic mouse Sertoli cells immediately
after the onset of Sry and Sox9 expression. Pgds upregulation was
mediated by Sox9, but not Sry, and required the binding of dimeric Sox9
to a paired SOX recognition site within the Pgds 5-prime flanking
region.

GENE STRUCTURE

White et al. (1992) isolated the PTGDS gene from a genomic library. It
spans 3,600 bp and contains 7 exons. The transcriptional start site was
mapped to a G residue 74 bp 5-prime of the ATG initiation codon. A TATA
box-like element (ATAAATA) was situated 21 bp upstream of the mRNA start
site. The gene for PGDS had a close structural resemblance to those for
murine major urinary protein (MUP) and ovine beta-lactoglobulin.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), White et al. (1992)
localized the PGDS2 gene to 9q34.2-q34.3. By dual-color FISH, they
demonstrated the following order: cen--HXB (187380)--ABL
(189980)--PGDS--tel. Southern blot analysis indicated that there is a
single copy of the gene in the haploid genome.

By linkage analyses in an interspecific backcross progeny in the mouse,
Chan et al. (1994) mapped the Ptgds gene to chromosome 2 in a region of
homology to human 9q34 and in the same region as other genes of the
lipocalin family. By interspecific backcross linkage analysis, Pilz et
al. (1995) mapped the Ptgds gene to mouse chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Miwa et al. (2004) identified 6 SNPs in the LPGDS gene in a Japanese
population, including a common 4111A-C SNP in the 3-prime UTR. Serum
levels of high density lipoprotein were significantly higher in
individuals with the AA genotype of 4111A-C compared with those with the
AC or CC genotypes. The maximum intima-media thickness in the common
carotid artery (CIMT-max) was significantly smaller in subjects with the
AA genotype than in those with AC or CC. Logistic regression analysis
revealed that the presence of the AA genotype significantly reduced the
risk for increased CIMT-max, even after adjustment for other risk
factors. Miwa et al. (2004) concluded that the 4111A-C SNP in the LPGDS
gene contributes to development of carotid atherosclerosis in Japanese
hypertensive patients.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinzar et al. (2000) noted that PGD2 is the most abundant prostanoid
produced in the central nervous system of mammals and one of the most
potent sleep-inducing substances. It induces excess sleep in rats and
monkeys after intracerebral ventricular infusion. Sleep induced by PGD2
is indistinguishable from physiologic sleep, as judged by
electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), brain temperature,
locomotor activities, heart rate, and general behavior of animals (Onoe
et al., 1988). PGD2 is produced in the arachidonic acid cascade from a
common precursor of various prostanoids, PGH2, by the action of PTGDS.
In the CNS, PGDS is produced mainly in the leptomeninges and choroid
plexus and secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid as beta-trace, the
second most abundant protein in CSF after albumin. To examine the
function of PTGDS, as well as endogenously produced PGD2 in sleep
regulation in vivo, Pinzar et al. (2000) generated transgenic mice that
overexpressed the human PTGDS gene to study their sleep behavior.
Although no differences were observed in the sleep/wake patterns between
wildtype and transgenic mice, a striking time-dependent increase in
nonrapid eye movement (NREM), but not in rapid eye movement (REM), sleep
was observed in 2 independent lines of transgenic mice after stimulation
by tail clipping. Concomitantly, the spontaneous locomotor activity of
transgenic mice was drastically decreased in response to the tail clip.
Induction of NREM sleep in transgenic mice was positively correlated
with the PGD2 production in the brain. Sleep, locomotion, and PGD2
content were essentially unchanged in wildtype mice after tail clipping.
The results demonstrated the involvement of the PTGDS gene in the
regulation of NREM sleep. Thus, the PTGDS gene appears to be responsible
for the regulation of NREM sleep, in contrast to the orexin/hypocretin
gene (HCRT; 602358), which is involved in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy
and possibly in the regulation of REM sleep.

Ragolia et al. (2005) found that Lpgds-knockout mice became glucose
intolerant and insulin resistant at an accelerated rate compared with
controls. Adipocytes were significantly larger in Lpgds-knockout mice
compared with controls on the same diets. Cell culture data revealed
significant differences between insulin-stimulated MAP kinase
phosphatase-2 (DUSP4; 602747), protein tyrosine phosphatase-1D (PTPN21;
603271), and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (PTK2; 600758)
expression levels in Lpgds-knockout vascular smooth muscle cells and
controls. Only Lpgds-knockout mice developed nephropathy and an aortic
thickening reminiscent of the early stages of atherosclerosis when fed a
'diabetogenic' diet.

Qu et al. (2006) found that selenium tetrachloride (SeCl4), an inhibitor
of prostaglandin D synthase, inhibited sleep in wildtype mice
dose-dependently and immediately after administration. SeCl4-induced
insomnia was observed in hematopoietic Pgds (HPGDS; 602598)-knockout
mice, but not in Lpgds-knockout mice, Lpgds/Hpgds double-knockout mice,
or prostaglandin D receptor (PTGDR; 604687)-knockout mice.
Administration of a Ptgdr antagonist reduced sleep of rats by 30%.

Philibert et al. (2013) found that 24% of Ptgds -/- mice and 16% of
Ptgds +/- mice presented with random unilateral undescended testes. All
other parts of the male reproductive system appeared normal. The
undescended testis located cranially to the inguinal canal in a
suprascrotal position. The phenotype was accompanied by decreased Rxfp2
(606655) mRNA expression in the gubernaculum and was similar to that
observed in mice with conditional inactivation of androgen receptor (AR;
313700) in the gubernaculum.

611864	TITLE *611864 ARMADILLO REPEAT-CONTAINING 10; ARMC10
;;SPLICING VARIANT INVOLVED IN HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS; SVH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By representational difference analysis, followed by database analysis,
and screening a hepatoma cell line cDNA library, Huang et al. (2003)
cloned ARMC10, which they called SVH. The deduced 343-amino acid protein
contains an armadillo repeat, an N-terminal cell attachment sequence, an
N-terminal transmembrane domain, and 3 PKC and 6 casein kinase II
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a major 2.6-kb
transcript in all tissues tested with high expression in placenta,
liver, kidney, heart, and brain. RT-PCR analysis identified 4 splice
variants, resulting from alternative splicing of exons 2 and 5, which
they designated SVHA, SVHB, SVHC, and SVHD. Confocal microscopy and
immunofluorescence studies localized all splice variants to the
endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and the N-terminal transmembrane domain
was required for ER subcellular localization. Quantitative RT-PCR showed
that only SVHB, which lacks exon 2, was upregulated in hepatocellular
carcinoma samples.

GENE FUNCTION

Huang et al. (2003) showed that overexpression of the SVHB variant
accelerated cell growth in a normal liver cell line and promoted tumor
formation in nude mice. Antisense inhibition of SVHB mRNA decreased cell
growth and induced apoptosis in a hepatoma cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huang et al. (2003) determined that the ARMC10 gene contains 7 exons
spanning approximately 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Huang et al. (2003) mapped the ARMC10 gene
to chromosome 7q11.2.

610378	TITLE *610378 GLIS FAMILY ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 1; GLIS1
;;GLI-SIMILAR PROTEIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GLIS1 is a GLI (165220)-related Kruppel-like zinc finger protein that
functions as an activator and repressor of transcription (Kim et al.,
2002).

CLONING

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with the ligand-binding domain of nuclear
orphan receptor ROR-gamma (RORC; 602943) as bait, Kim et al. (2002)
obtained a partial Glis1 cDNA from a mouse lymphoma cDNA library. Using
this fragment to screen a mouse kidney cDNA library, followed by PCR and
5-prime RACE, they cloned full-length Glis1. The deduced 789-amino acid
protein contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal, a proline-rich
region, and a zinc finger domain consisting of 5 tandem C2H2-type zinc
finger motifs. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected highest
expression of Glis1 in placenta and kidney, lower expression in testis,
and little expression in other tissues examined. RT-PCR analysis
detected high expression in kidney, low expression in brain, colon,
brown fat, testis, and thymus, and no expression in lung, spleen, liver,
pancreas, and muscle, In situ hybridization of mouse embryos showed that
Glis1 was expressed primarily in the mesodermal lineages, including
craniofacial regions, branchial arches, somites, vibrissal and hair
follicles, limb buds, and myotomes. By confocal microscopy of monkey
kidney fibroblast CV1 cells expressing full-length and mutant mouse
Glis1, Kim et al. (2002) localized Glis1 to the nucleus in a speckled
pattern similar to that observed for many transcription factors.

GENE FUNCTION

By EMSA analysis, Kim et al. (2002) showed that mouse Glis1 is able to
bind oligonucleotides containing the Gli-binding site consensus
sequence.

Using monohybrid and deletion analyses, Kim et al. (2002) showed that
Glis1 contains a strong activation domain in the C terminus and a
repressor domain in the N terminus. Glis1-mediated transactivation
activity varied among different cell lines tested, and Kim et al. (2002)
suggested that these differences may be related to different levels of
expression or activation of Glis1 coactivators. By cotransfection of
Glis1 and CaMKiV (CAMK4; 114080), Kim et al. (2002) showed that CAMK4
stimulates Glis1 transactivation activity.

By in situ hybridization analysis, Nakanishi et al. (2006) showed that
Glis1 mRNA is not expressed in normal human epidermis or in normal mouse
skin, but is highly induced in the epidermis of psoriatic patients and
in PMA-treated mouse skin. GLIS1 expression was undetectable in human
epidermal keratinocytes but increased significantly after treatment with
proinflammatory agents PMA or interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). PMA
induction of GLIS1 expression was cell type-specific and confined to
cell types in which PMA induction is accompanied by cell
differentiation. Nakanishi et al. (2006) showed that in human
keratinocytes immortalized by HPV-E6, full-length mouse Glis1 localized
to the cytoplasm and a C-terminal truncated form of Glis1 that retains
the zinc finger domain localized to the nucleus. By microarray analysis
of a human epidermal keratinocyte cell line expressing the C-terminal
truncated form of mouse Glis1, Nakanishi et al. (2006) found that Glis1
induced several genes known to be differentially regulated during
epidermal differentiation, including S100A9 (123886), KLK7 (604438),
SPRR/cornifin (SPRR1B; 182266), involucrin (IVL; 147360), and
transglutaminase-1 (TGM1; 190195). Nakanishi et al. (2006) suggested
that Glis1 may play a role in the aberrant differentiation observed in
psoriatic epidermis.

Maekawa et al. (2011) showed that Glis1 markedly enhances the generation
of induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) from both mouse and human
fibroblasts when it is expressed together with Oct3/4 (164177), Sox2
(184429), and Klf4 (602253). Mouse IPSCs generated using this
combination of transcription factors can form germline-competent
chimeras. Glis1 is enriched in unfertilized oocytes and in embryos at
the 1-cell stage. DNA microarray analyses show that Glis1 promotes
multiple pro-reprogramming pathways, including Myc (190080), Nanog
(607937), Lin28 (611043), Wnt (see 606359), Esrrb (602167), and the
mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Maekawa et al. (2011) concluded that
Glis1 effectively promotes the direct reprogramming of somatic cells
during iPSC generation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GLIS1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-34268). By FISH, Kim et al. (2002)
mapped the mouse Glis1 gene to chromosome 4C6.

VACUOLAR PROTON PUMP, SUBUNIT 1; VPP1
DESCRIPTION ATP-driven proton pumps associated with the clathrin-coated vesicles and
synaptic vesicles are a group of polypeptides involved in basic cellular
processes through acidification of intracellular organelles. These
functions include intracellular targeting of enzymes to lysosomes and
secretory granules, and receptor-ligand dissociation in
receptor-mediated endocytosis. Eight or 9 polypeptides had been
identified from clathrin-coated vesicles. Using a rat cDNA clone for the
116-kD subunit of the vacuolar proton pump, Ozcelik et al. (1991) mapped
the gene to human chromosome 17 by study of rodent-human hybrid cell
lines and the homologous gene to mouse chromosome 11 by a study of
Chinese hamster or rat/mouse hybrid cell lines. In hybrid cell lines
with fragments of chromosome 17, the VPP1 gene was shown to be located
in region 17q21-qter.

In the course of constructing a transcription map of approximately 600
kb of genomic DNA surrounding the BRCA1 (113705) gene, Brody et al.
(1995) identified the VPP1 gene, thus regionalizing it to 17q21.

604089	TITLE *604089 HEMATOPOIETIC CELL SIGNAL TRANSDUCER; HCST
;;DNAX-ACTIVATION PROTEIN 10; DAP10
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Many immune receptors are composed of separate ligand-binding and
signal-transducing subunits. In natural killer (NK) and T cells, Wu et
al. (1999) identified DAP10 as a cell surface adaptor protein in an
activating receptor complex with NKG2D (602893), a receptor for the
stress-inducible and tumor-associated major histocompatibility complex
molecule MICA (600169). Wu et al. (1999) identified an EST with homology
to DAP12 (TYROBP; 604142). The DAP10 cDNA encodes a 93-amino acid type I
membrane protein. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses detected DAP10
expression as an approximately 500-kb transcript primarily in
hematopoietic cells. Protein immunoblot analysis revealed multiple bands
migrating more slowly than the predicted 10 kD, primarily due to
O-linked glycosylation. Within the DAP10 cytoplasmic domain, an SH2
domain-binding site was capable of recruiting the p85 subunit of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see 171833), providing for
NKG2D-dependent transduction. Thus, NKG2D-DAP10 receptor complexes may
activate NK and T-cell responses against MICA-bearing tumors.
Cotransfection of Flag-DAP10 and NKG2D resulted in surface expression of
both proteins, whereas alone they were minimally expressed. Wu et al.
(1999) concluded that the finding that NKG2D-DAP10 complex is a receptor
for the nonclassical MHC class I molecule MICA and evidence that these
molecules are stress-inducible and broadly expressed in epithelial
tumors suggest that the activating NKG2D-DAP10 complex may be involved
in innate immune surveillance.

GENE FUNCTION

Billadeau et al. (2003) noted that DAP10, which is associated with
NKG2D, lacks an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in
its cytoplasmic tail. They identified a crucial tyr-ile-asn-met motif in
the DAP10 cytoplasmic tail that couples receptor stimulation to
downstream activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, VAV1 (164875),
Rho family GTPases (see 165390), and phospholipase C (see 600220).
Billadeau et al. (2003) concluded that activation of NKG2D-DAP10
proceeds independently of Syk family protein tyrosine kinases (see
600085) and ITAM-containing subunits, but it is capable of initiating
signals that induce killing.

MAPPING

Wu et al. (1999) reported that the human HCST gene resides on chromosome
19q13.1 in opposite transcriptional orientation to the DAP12 gene. The 2
genes are separated by 130 basepairs.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gilfillan et al. (2002) showed that CD8-positive T cells from
Dap10-deficient mice lacked Nkg2d expression and were unable to mount
tumor-specific responses. In contrast, NK cells from these animals
expressed a functional Nkg2d receptor through association with another
adaptor molecule, Dap12, which recruited protein tyrosine kinases.

;;KIAA0940
CPEB3 RIBOZYME, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned CPEB3, which they designated
KIAA0940. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in brain, intermediate
expression in kidney, heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, testis,
ovary, pancreas, and fetal liver, and low expression in spleen and fetal
brain. CPEB3 was expressed in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest levels in amygdala and substantia nigra.

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) stated that CPEB3 transcripts use 2
alternate untranslated first exons, one expressed in liver and testis,
and the other expressed in brain. The 698-amino acid CPEB3 protein has
an N-terminal glutamine-rich domain, followed by 2 RNA recognition
motifs and a C-terminal zinc finger domain. The glutamine-rich domain is
not present in other CPEBs.

- CPEB3 Ribozyme

Using an in vitro self-selection technique, Salehi-Ashtiani et al.
(2006) identified self-cleaving ribozymes associated with olfactory
receptor OR4K15, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R; 147370),
a LINE-1 retrotransposon (see LRE1; 151626), and CPEB3. The CPEB3
ribozyme is located within intron 3 and is structurally related to
ribozymes from human hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a single-stranded RNA
satellite virus for hepatitis B infection (see 610424). EST database
analysis and RT-PCR of human and mouse total RNA extracts indicated that
the CPEB3 ribozyme is expressed and self-cleaves in vivo.
Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) identified the CPEB3 ribozyme only in
mammalian vertebrates. They proposed that HDV ribozymes and the CPEB3
ribozyme are evolutionarily related, and that HDV arose from the human
transcriptome.

GENE FUNCTION

- CPEB3 Ribozyme

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) narrowed the active sequence of the CPEB3
ribozyme to 81 nucleotides. This 81-nucleotide construct cleaved to
produce a 9-nucleotide upstream fragment containing a 2-prime-to-3-prime
cyclic phosphate, and a 72-nucleotide downstream fragment containing a
5-prime terminal hydroxyl that could be phosphorylated with
polynucleotide kinase (PNKP; 605610). The ribozyme had a low Mg(2+)
requirement, and was also active in the presence of Mn(2+) and Ca(2+).
Ribozyme activity was almost constant between pH 5.5 and 8.5, suggesting
the presence of 2 functional groups.

GENE STRUCTURE

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) reported that the CPEB3 gene spans 242 kb
and contains 11 exons, including 2 alternatively spliced, untranslated
first exons. Intron 3 spans 46 kb and contains a ribozyme.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the CPEB3 gene
to chromosome 10.

DILUTE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Engle and Kennett (1994) cloned the human homolog of the mouse 'dilute'
gene, MYO5A. They suggested Griscelli syndrome (see 214450) and
neuroectodermal melanolysosomal disease (256710) as candidates for
mutations in the myoxin gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Several findings indicate that class V myosins perform multiple
functions within the cell. Espreafico et al. (1998) used a green
fluorescent protein (GFP) tag to characterize myosin V localization in
cultured mammalian cells and in primary cultures of rat hippocampus. In
all cells investigated, myosin V immunoreactivity was associated with
the centrosome. In interphase cells, myosin V was found in
pericentriolar material, and in both mother and daughter centrioles.
During cell division, myosin V staining was intense throughout the
cytoplasm and was concentrated in a trail between migrating centrioles
and in the mitotic spindle poles and spindle fibers. The consistent
association of myosin V with the centrosome was observed at all stages
of the cell cycle by all methods used. Espreafico et al. (1998) noted
that melanocytes isolated from 'dilute lethal' mice divide at half the
rate of melanocytes isolated from wildtype mice. They suggested that
myosin V function in the centrosome of human lymphocytes may be
essential either for cellular proliferation or for the polarized
movement of the centrosome that occurs during T-killer or T-helper cell
response.

Mehta et al. (1999) demonstrated that myosin V is a processive motor.
Processivity means that the motor undergoes multiple catalytic cycles
and coupled mechanical advances for each diffusional encounter with its
track. This allows single motors to support movement of an organelle
along its track. Mehta et al. (1999) provided direct evidence that
myosin V is a processive actin-based motor that can move in large steps
approximating the 36-nm pseudo-repeat of the actin filament. Rief et al.
(2000) provided a molecular model for myosin V processivity. The
findings of Rief et al. (2000) were discussed by Yanagida and Iwane
(2000).

Myosin V has heads of about 31 nm that could span the 36-nm actin
helical repeat and thus allow single 2-headed molecules to transport
cargo by walking straight. Walker et al. (2000) used electron microscopy
to show that while working, myosin V spans the helical repeat. The heads
are mostly 13 actin subunits apart, with values of 11 or 15 also found.
Typically the structure is polar and one head is curved, the other
straighter. Single particle processing reveals the polarity of the
underlying actin filament, showing that the curved head is the leading
one. The shape of the leading head may correspond to the beginning of
the working stroke of the motor. Walker et al. (2000) also observed
molecules attached by one head in this conformation. To test Walker's
hypothesis, Tanaka et al. (2002) measured the mechanical properties of
single molecules of myosin V truncation mutants with neck domains only
one-sixth of the native length. Tanaka et al. (2002) demonstrated that
the processivity and step distance along actin are both similar to those
of full-length myosin V. Thus, Tanaka et al. (2002) concluded that the
long neck domain is not essential for either the large steps or
processivity of myosin V. Their results challenged the lever-arm model.

El-Husseini and Vincent (1999) determined that an endogenous
brain-expressed ring finger (RNF22; 605493) interacts with class V
myosins. The authors hypothesized that interactions between RNF22 and
class V myosins may be important in organelle transport and neurite
outgrowth.

Fukuda et al. (2002) characterized the interaction between mouse MyoVa
and Rab27a (603868) in their studies of pigment granule transport. By
deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, they determined that
melanophilin (606526) interacts with both proteins. The tripartite
protein complex could be immunoprecipitated from mouse melanocytes.

Organelle transport by myosin V is downregulated during mitosis,
presumably by myosin V phosphorylation. Karcher et al. (2001) used mass
spectrometry phosphopeptide mapping to show that the tail of myosin V
was phosphorylated in mitotic Xenopus egg extract on a single serine
residue localized in the carboxyl-terminal organelle-binding domain.
Phosphorylation resulted in the release of the motor from the organelle.
The phosphorylation site matched the consensus sequence of
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK2; see 114078), and
inhibitors of CAMK2 prevented myosin V release.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Forkey et al. (2003) reported 3-dimensional measurements of the
structural dynamics of the light chain domain of brain myosin V using a
single-molecule fluorescence polarization technique that determines the
orientation of individual protein domains with 20- to 40-ms time
resolution. Single fluorescent calmodulin (see 114180) light chains
tilted back and forth between 2 well-defined angles as the myosin
molecule processively translocated along actin. These results provided
evidence for lever arm rotation of the calmodulin-binding domain in
myosin V, and supported a hand-over-hand mechanism for the translocation
of double-headed myosin V molecules along actin filaments.

Myosin V is a dimeric molecular motor that moves processively on actin,
with the center of mass moving about 37 nanometers for each ATP
hydrolyzed. Yildiz et al. (2003) labeled myosin V with a single
fluorophore at different positions in the light chain domain and
measured the step size with a standard deviation of less than 1.5
nanometers, with 0.5-second temporal resolution, and observation times
of minutes. The step size alternates between 37 + 2x nanometers and 37 -
2x, where x is the distance along the direction of motion between the
dye and the midpoint between the 2 heads. Yildiz et al. (2003) concluded
that these results strongly support a hand-over-hand model of motility,
not an inchworm model.

Liu et al. (2006) showed the first 3-dimensional structure of the myosin
V inactive state. Each myosin V molecule consists of 2 heads that
contain an N-terminal motor domain followed by a lever arm that binds 6
calmodulins. The heads are followed by a coiled-coil dimerization domain
(S2) and a C-terminal globular cargo-binding domain. In the inactive
structure, bending of myosin V at the head-S2 junction places the
cargo-binding domain near the motor domain's ATP-binding pocket,
indicating that ATPase inhibition might occur through decreased rates of
nucleotide exchange. The actin-binding interfaces are unobstructed, and
the lever arm is oriented in a position typical of strong actin-binding
states. Liu et al. (2006) concluded that this structure indicates that
motor recycling after cargo delivery might occur through transport on
actively treadmilling actin filaments rather than by diffusion.

Thirumurugan et al. (2006) described the structure of folded myosin and
the role of the globular tail domains in regulating activity. Electron
microscopy showed that the 2 heads lie on either side of the tail,
contacting the globular tail domains at a lobe of the motor domain
(approximately pro117 to pro137) that contains conserved acidic side
chains, suggesting ionic interactions between motor domain and globular
tail domains. Myosin V heavy meromyosin, a constitutively active
fragment lacking the globular tail domains, was inhibited and folded by
a dimeric GST-globular tail domain fusion protein. Motility assays
revealed that at nanomolar calcium levels heavy meromyosin moves
robustly on actin filaments whereas few myosins bind or move.
Thirumurugan et al. (2006) concluded that with no cargo, the globular
tail domains bind in an intramolecular manner to the motor domains,
producing an inhibited and compact structure that binds weakly to actin
and allows the molecule to recycle towards new cargoes.

To observed under a microscope how the necks of myosin V move,
Shiroguchi and Kinosita (2007) attached a micrometer-sized rod to one of
the necks. The leading neck swings unidirectionally forward, whereas the
trailing neck, once lifted, undergoes extensive Brownian rotation in all
directions before landing on a site ahead of the leading neck. The
neck-neck joint is essentially free, and the neck motion supports a
mechanism where the active swing of the leading neck biases the random
motion of the lifted head to let it eventually land on a forward site.

MAPPING

Engle and Kennett (1994) assigned the MYO5A gene to human chromosome 15
by Southern blot analysis of a panel of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids. The 'dilute' gene maps to mouse chromosome 9, distal to a group
of 3 loci of which the human homologs are located in the region
15q22-q26.

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization, Moore et al.
(1995) mapped the MYH12 gene to 15q21, thus extending distally the
region of chromosome 15 with syntenic homology to mouse chromosome 9.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Griscelli syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized
by pigmentary dilution and either central nervous system (Griscelli
syndrome type 1, or GS1; 214450) or immunologic (GS2; 607624) defects.
Pastural et al. (1997) mapped a locus for Griscelli syndrome to 15q21 by
linkage to polymorphic markers in 3 consanguineous families and in 1
nonconsanguineous family. Pastural et al. (1997, 2000) demonstrated
mutations in the MYO5A gene in patients with GS1 (160777.0002,
160777.0003).

Anikster et al. (2002), Menasche et al. (2002), Huizing et al. (2002),
and Bahadoran et al. (2003, 2003) suggested that Elejalde syndrome
(256710) in some patients and GS1 represent the same entity.

In a patient with hypopigmentation without any immunologic or neurologic
manifestations (Griscelli syndrome type 3, 609227), Menasche et al.
(2003) identified a homozygous deletion of the F-exon of the MYO5A gene
(160777.0004).

ANIMAL MODEL

In the mouse, hundreds of 'dilute' mutations have been identified and
analyzed, making the 'dilute' locus one of the best characterized
genetically of all mammalian loci. The recessive 'dilute' (d) coat color
mutation carried by many inbred strains of mice produces a lightening of
coat color, caused by an abnormal adendritic melanocyte morphology that
results in an uneven release of pigment granules into the developing
hair shaft (Russell, 1949; Markert and Silvers, 1956). Most 'dilute'
alleles also produce a neurologic defect characterized by convulsions
and opisthotonos, apparent at 8 to 10 days of age, and continuing until
the death of the animal at 2 to 3 weeks of age. Jenkins et al. (1981)
discovered that the original 'dilute' allele was the result of the
integration of an ecotropic murine leukemia provirus. Copeland et al.
(1983) and Strobel et al. (1990) cloned genomic DNA of the 'dilute'
locus and Mercer et al. (1991) studied cDNA from the 'dilute' locus. The
predicted amino acid sequence of the gene product indicated that
'dilute' encodes a novel type of myosin heavy chain, with a C-terminal
region that has elements of both type II (alpha-helical coiled-coil) and
type I (non-coiled-coil) myosin heavy chains. 'Dilute' transcripts were
differentially expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues and were
abundant in neurons of the central nervous system, cephalic ganglia, and
spinal ganglia. The results suggested an important role for the gene
product called myoxin in the elaboration, maintenance, or function of
cellular processes of melanocytes and neurons.

The 'flailer' (flr) mouse exhibits a phenotype consisting of frequent
falling, convulsive limb movements (leg flailing), and ataxia persistent
into adulthood. The phenotype is similar to that of homozygotes for null
alleles of Myo5a. Jones et al. (2000) determined that the flailer mouse
expresses a novel gene combining the promoter and first 2 exons of
guanine nucleotide-binding protein beta-5 (GNB5; 604447) with the
C-terminal exons of the closely linked myosin-5A (MyoVA) gene (Myo5a).
Biochemical and genetic studies indicated that the flailer protein,
which is expressed predominantly in brain, competes with wildtype MyoVA
in vivo, preventing the localization of smooth endoplasmic reticulum
vesicles in the dendritic spines of cerebellar Purkinje cells. The
flailer protein thus has a dominant-negative mechanism of action with a
recessive mode of inheritance due to the dependence of competitive
binding on the ratio between mutant and wildtype proteins. The
chromosomal arrangement of Myo5a upstream of Gnb5 is consistent with
nonhomologous recombination as the mutational mechanism.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
REMOVED FROM DATABASE
.0002
GRISCELLI SYNDROME, TYPE 1
MYO5A, 2332C-T

Pastural et al. (1997) found a homozygous C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 2332, resulting in premature termination and presumptive
truncation of the polypeptide at codon 779, in a girl with presumed
Griscelli syndrome (214450). The patient did not suffer from recurrent
infections, although she displayed the characteristic pigmentary
dilution. In addition, she had had marked motor developmental delay with
hypotonia and mental retardation since the age of 3 months. The family
was from Turkey and the parents were consanguineous. The truncated
protein was predicted to lack the last 1,078 amino acids.

Anikster et al. (2002) suggested that the patients of Pastural et al.
(1997) and other patients with primary central nervous system
complications and MYO5A mutations have not Griscelli syndrome but the
related disorder neuroectodermal melanolysosomal disease (256710). They
offered several lines of evidence to support their thesis.

.0003
GRISCELLI SYNDROME, TYPE 1
MYO5A, 47-BP INS, NT4634

In a patient with Griscelli syndrome type 1 (214450), Pastural et al.
(2000) found a 47-bp insertion in the MYO5A gene beginning at position
4634, corresponding to residue 1545, that predicted a truncated protein
lacking most of the globular domain.

.0004
GRISCELLI SYNDROME, TYPE 3
MYO5A, F-EXON DEL

In a patient with Griscelli syndrome type 3 (609227), first reported by
Sanal et al. (2002), Menasche et al. (2003) identified a homozygous
2,439-bp deletion spanning the entire F-exon of the MYO5A gene,
including part of the flanking 5-prime and 3-prime intronic sequences.
Microscopic analysis of the patient's hair shafts revealed large clumps
of pigment, a characteristic feature of Griscelli syndrome, but the
patient had no immunologic or neurologic symptoms at 8 years of
follow-up.

140750	TITLE *140750 SUPPRESSOR OF TUMORIGENICITY 5; ST5
;;HELA TUMOR SUPPRESSION; HTS1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The tumorigenicity of HeLa cells in nude mice can be suppressed by the
addition of a normal human chromosome 11 in somatic cell hybrids
(Stanbridge, 1976; Klinger, 1980); see 191181 for description of a
tumor-suppressor gene located on 11q. Lichy et al. (1992) isolated a
HeLa cell line that displayed morphologic features of the nontumorigenic
hybrids, demonstrated reduced tumorigenicity in nude mice, and showed an
85% reduction in alkaline phosphatase, a consistent marker of the
tumorigenic phenotype in these cells. This cell line, designated F2,
contained a single exogenous cDNA, which was recovered by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and designated HTS1 because of its probable
association with 'HeLa tumor suppression.' In nontumorigenic hybrids,
RNA species of 2.8, 3.1, and 4.6 kb were identified. In 2 tumorigenic
hybrid lines, the 2.8-kb species was markedly reduced or absent. Whereas
3 nontumorigenic human keratinocyte lines expressed all 3 RNA species,
several tumorigenic cervical carcinoma cell lines lacked the 2.8-kb
species.

Gohring et al. (2010) noted that the ST5 gene encodes 3 isoforms with
all 3 isoforms containing a C-terminal DENN domain but only isoforms 1
and 3 containing an ABL1-interacting domain. Quantitative PCR analysis
detected a relatively uniform ST5 expression pattern in human fetal
tissue. Expression in most human adult tissue was lower than in
corresponding fetal tissues; however, adult expression was 2.5 to 3-fold
higher in adult brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle compared to fetal
tissue. In situ hybridization analysis of mouse embryos showed that St5
was expressed in neuroepithelium of the midbrain, telencephalon, and
hindbrain, and later in the ventricular and marginal zone of the frontal
cortex. Adult mice showed St5 expression in the cerebellum and
hippocampus. Expression was also found in the heart and tubular
structures of the kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gohring et al. (2010) noted that the ST5 gene contains at least 23 exons
spanning 207.6 kb and that the first 4 exons are noncoding.

MAPPING

Lichy et al. (1992) localized the HTS1 gene to 11p15 by in situ
hybridization, confirming the assignment to chromosome 11 by somatic
cell hybrid analysis. They reviewed previous evidence indicating the
presence of a tumor suppressor gene in the 11p15 region; see 194071 and
185440.

By genomic sequence analysis, Amid et al. (2001) mapped the ST5 gene to
chromosome 11p15.3. They mapped the mouse St5 gene to distal chromosome
7 in a region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome
11p15.3. In both genomes, ST5 lies telomeric to the CEGF1 gene and
centromeric to the LMO1 gene (186921).

CYTOGENETICS

Gohring et al. (2010) reported a boy, first seen at age 3.5-years, with
severe mental retardation, hypotonia, seizures, and sensorineural
hearing loss associated with a de novo t(11;20)(p15.4;q13.2)
translocation that interrupted the ST5 gene. Dysmorphic facial features
included high forehead, high-arched and laterally placed eyebrows,
narrow upslanting palpebral fissures, mild hypertelorism, broad
glabella, small mouth with thin upper lip, cleft palate, broad nasal
bridge, and hypoplastic nasal wings. Other features included persistent
ductus arteriosus, unilateral cystic kidney dysplasia, and frequent
infections. At age 7 years, he could walk with orthoses but had no
speech development. He was born of healthy, unrelated parents who did
not carry the translocation. Breakpoint analysis showed that the
chromosome 11 breakpoint was in intron 4 in the 5-prime untranslated
region of the ST5 gene, before the first coding exon 5. This was
predicted to separate the complete coding sequence of the gene from its
promoter region. The breakpoint on chromosome 20 did not occur in any
known genes. Screening of the ST5 gene in 220 additional patients with
mental retardation did not identify pathogenic mutations.

;;SET8;;
PR/SET DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7; PR/SET7;;
PR/SET07;;
HISTONE H4-LYSINE 20-SPECIFIC METHYLTRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SETD8 is a lysine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.43) that predominantly
monomethylates lysine-20 (K20) of histone H4 (see 602822). Through its
methyltransferase activity, SETD8 influences transcriptional regulation,
heterochromatin formation, genomic stability, cell cycle progression,
and development (Yang et al., 2012).

CLONING

By purifying histone H4 lysine methyltransferase activity from HeLa cell
nuclear lysates, followed by peptide sequencing, database analysis, and
PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Nishioka et al. (2002) cloned SETD8,
which they designated PR/SET7. The deduced 322-amino acid protein has a
C-terminal SET domain but lacks pre- and post-SET domains found in other
histone methyltransferases. Database analysis revealed orthologs of
SETD8 in worms, flies, and vertebrates, but not in lower eukaryotes.

Yang et al. (2012) showed that full-length SET8 contains 352 amino
acids; the SET domain encompasses amino acids 216 through 343.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the SETD8 gene to chromosome 12q24.31 based on an
alignment of the SETD8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF287261) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Nishioka et al. (2002) showed that a mutation in Drosophila Pr/set7 was
lethal: second instar larval death coincided with the loss of H4-lys20
methylation, indicating a fundamental role for Pr/set7 in development.
Transcriptionally competent regions lacked H4-lys20 methylation, but the
modification coincided with condensed chromosomal regions on polytene
chromosomes, including chromocenter and euchromatic arms. The Drosophila
male X chromosome, which is hyperacetylated at H4-lys16, had
significantly decreased levels of lys20 methylation compared with that
of females. In vitro, methylation of lys20 and acetylation of lys16 on
the H4 tail were competitive. Taken together, these results supported
the hypothesis that methylation of H4-lys20 maintains silent chromatin,
in part, by precluding neighboring acetylation on the H4 tail.

Shi et al. (2007) showed that SET8 monomethylated p53 (TP53; 191170) in
human cell lines. This monomethylation suppressed p53-mediated
transcriptional activation of highly responsive target genes, such as
p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and PUMA (BBC3; 605854), but it had little
influence on weak p53 targets. Depletion of SET8 augmented the
proapoptotic and checkpoint activation functions of p53, and SET8
expression was downregulated upon DNA damage.

Song et al. (2009) found evidence that expression of SET8 is regulated
by the microRNA MIR502 (300893; see MOLECULAR GENETICS).

Kudithipudi et al. (2012) synthesized peptides based on the SET8
recognition site surrounding monomethylated H4K20. They found that the
isolated SET domain of SET8 had a relatively long recognition sequence
covering 7 amino acids. SET8 methylated a number of the synthesized
peptides, suggesting that it could potentially methylate several
nonhistone proteins in addition to p53.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, Yang
et al. (2012) found that SET8 interacts with TWIST (TWIST1; 601622), a
basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor that regulates
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Domain analysis revealed that
the N-terminal half of SET8 was required for the interaction. TWIST and
SET8 cooperated to promote EMT and metastasis in breast cancer cells
following implantation in mice. In knockdown and overexpression studies,
TWIST recruited SET8 to the promoter regions of E-cadherin (CDH1;
192090) and N-cadherin (CDH2; 114020), and histone H4K20 monomethylation
by SET8 resulted in downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of
N-cadherin.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Song et al. (2009) identified a SNP (dbSNP rs16917496C-T) in the SET8
miR502 (300893)-binding site that influenced SET8 expression. Breast
cancer tissues with the CC genotype, which represents the perfect
complementary seed sequence for miR502, had lower expression of SET8
mRNA than those with the TT genotype.

606592	TITLE *606592 VANIN 3; VNN3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database analysis, Granjeaud et al. (1999) identified a novel
human VNN gene, VNN3. Martin et al. (2001) cloned a full-length VNN3
cDNA encoding a deduced 501-amino acid protein with strong similarity to
the mouse vnn3 molecule. Both the mouse and human proteins lack the
GPI-anchor motif found in VNN1 (603570) and VNN2 (603571). Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.8-kb VNN3 mRNA in human liver, placenta, and
peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs). A 3.8-kb mRNA was observed in PBLs.

GENE FUNCTION

Martin et al. (2001) found that all vanin proteins are ectoenzymes with
pantetheinase activity. They showed that mouse vanin-3 and, by analogy,
human VNN3 are secreted molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Martin et al. (2001) determined that the human VNN1, VNN2, and VNN3
genes, as well as the mouse vnn1 and vnn3 genes, all contain 7 exons.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Martin et al. (2001) mapped the VNN3 gene to human
chromosome 6q23-q24 and mouse chromosome 10 in a cluster with VNN1 and
VNN2. All 3 genes are aligned in the same transcriptional orientation.

610711	TITLE *610711 TESTIS-SPECIFIC SERINE/THREONINE KINASE 4; TSSK4
;;TSSK5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSSK4 belongs to a family of serine/threonine kinases highly expressed
in testis (Chen et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for TSSK-like sequences, followed by PCR of a
testis cDNA library, Chen et al. (2005) cloned TSSK4, which they called
TSSK5. The deduced 328-amino acid protein is a putative serine/threonine
kinase. Northern blot analysis failed to detect TSSK4 expression, but
RT-PCR revealed TSSK4 expression in testis only.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro pull-down experiments, Chen et
al. (2005) showed the TSSK4 interacted with CREB (123810). TSSK4
phosphorylated CREB at ser133 and activated a CRE/CREB reporter gene in
transfected HEK293T cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2005) determined that the TSSK4 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2005) mapped the TSSK4 gene
to chromosome 14q11.2.

ALPHA-2,3-SIALYLTRANSFERASE II; ST3GALII;;
ST3N
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), previously reported by
Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), Hu et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile

identified a homozygous 958G-C transversion in exon 12 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an ala320-to-pro (A320P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the sialyl motif S. The mutation was identified by
linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.

612317	TITLE *612317 ATPase FAMILY, AAA DOMAIN-CONTAINING, MEMBER 3B; ATAD3B
;;TOB3;;
AAA-TOB3;;
KIAA1273
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATAD3A (612316) and ATAD3B are mitochondrial membrane proteins that
contribute to the stabilization of large mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA)-protein complexes called nucleoids (He et al., 2007).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned ATAD3B, which they designated
KIAA1273. The deduced protein contains 606 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected low ATAD3B expression in testis and ovary, with weaker
expression in liver. Little to no expression was detected in other adult
and fetal tissues examined. Within specific adult brain regions, weak
expression was detected in caudate nucleus, and little to no expression
was detected in other brain regions.

By database analysis and 5-prime RACE, Schaffrik et al. (2006) obtained
cDNAs encoding long and short isoforms of ATAD3B, which they called
AAA-TOB3. The variants arise from alternative transcription initiation
sites, and the short variant includes the 3-prime sequence of intron 2,
which contains an alternate, in-frame ATG start site. The deduced 606-
and 648-amino acid ATAD3B proteins have unique N-terminal ends
containing 52 and 94 amino acids, respectively, followed by a common
transmembrane region and a C-terminal AAA-ATPase domain. RT-PCR detected
both transcripts in head and neck carcinoma and cervix carcinoma cell
lines. Both fluorescence-tagged ATAD3B isoforms localized to
mitochondria in transfected HeLa cells and in GHD-1 cells established
from a hypopharynx carcinoma.

By searching for sequences similar to rat Atad3, He et al. (2007)
identified human ATAD3A and ATAD3B. The deduced 648-amino acid ATAD3B
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 72 kD. In its C-terminal
half, ATAD3B contains Walker A and B motifs, followed by ATP-binding
sensor-1 and sensor-2 motifs. An alpha helix is located N-terminal to
the Walker A motif, and an arginine finger separates the sensor motifs.
An antibody that did not differentiate between ATAD3A and ATAD3B
detected ATAD3 in a punctate pattern within mitochondria of human
osteosarcoma cells. The pattern frequently coincided with
mtDNA-containing nucleoids, but not all nucleoids contained ATAD3.

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) stated that ATAD3B contains a central
transmembrane domain. Using immunofluorescence and protease
susceptibility studies, they found that ATAD3B was embedded in the inner
membrane of HeLa cell mitochondria, with the C-terminal AAA domain
directed toward the matrix and the N terminus exposed to the cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Da Cruz et al. (2003) found that prolonged expression of epitope-tagged
mouse Atad3b, which they called Tob3, in HeLa cells resulted in
fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and cell death.

Using laser capture microdissection, Schaffrik et al. (2006) found that
ATAD3B was overexpressed in 3 of 4 head and neck carcinomas compared
with healthy oral mucosa. In situ hybridization confirmed ATAD3B
overexpression in 5 head and neck carcinomas compared with normal
tissue. Expression of both ATAD3B isoforms was induced by MYC (190080).
In contrast to the findings of Da Cruz et al. (2003), Schaffrik et al.
(2006) found that knockdown of both human ATAD3B variants via small
interfering RNA (siRNA), but not their overexpression, caused cell
line-specific apoptotic phenotypes. In GHD-1 cells, siRNA treatment
resulted in apoptosis associated with decreased proliferation, cell
enlargement and vacuolization, and generation of polynucleated cells due
to failure of cytokinesis. In HeLa cells, siRNA treatment induced
apoptosis rapidly, with no formation of polynucleated cells.

He et al. (2007) found that depletion of ATAD3 via siRNA in human
osteosarcoma cells led to increased negative supercoiling of mtDNA,
although mitochondria maintained essentially normal morphology. A
recombinant N-terminal fragment of ATAD3B containing residues 44 through
247 displayed sequence-independent binding of tightly supercoiled mtDNA
that included a short, triple-stranded noncoding region called a
displacement loop, or D loop. This ATAD3B fragment also bound duplex DNA
and single-stranded DNA, but with lower affinity. The N-terminal ATAD3B
fragment and RecA (RAD51; 179617) bound to a synthetic D loop, and the
pronounced mobility shift effected by the ATAD3B fragment suggested that
it accrues multiple mtDNA molecules or that each D loop is bound by a
large number of ATAD3B molecules.

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) found that, although both ATAD3A and ATAD3B
were present in native HeLa cell nucleoids, neither ATAD3 protein was
crosslinked with mtDNA in isolated formaldehyde crosslinked HeLa cell
nucleoids, indicating that they are unlikely to bind mtDNA. In addition,
protease susceptibility studies suggested that the putative N-terminal
DNA-binding regions of ATAD3A and ATAD3B reside outside the
mitochondrial inner membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schaffrik et al. (2006) determined that the ATAD3B gene contains 16
exons. Intron 1 contains a canonical MYC-binding E-box sequence, and
intron 2 contains an alternate translation initiation site.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the ATAD3B
gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis, Schaffrik et al.
(2006) mapped the ATAD3B gene to chromosome 1p36.33

608337	TITLE *608337 OTU DOMAIN-CONTAINING UBIQUITIN ALDEHYDE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; OTUB1
;;OTU DOMAIN-CONTAINING UBAL-BINDING PROTEIN 1;;
OTUBAIN 1; OTU1; OTB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Otubains, such as OTB1, are deubiquitylating cysteine proteases (DUBs;
see 602519) that belong to the ovarian tumor (OTU) protein superfamily.
Like other DUBs, otubains cleave proteins precisely at the ubiquitin
(UB; see 191339)-protein bond (Balakirev et al., 2003).

CLONING

By affinity purification of DUBs from HeLa cells using UB aldehyde
(UBAL), followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrophotometric analysis,
Balakirev et al. (2003) obtained cDNAs encoding OTB1 and OTB2 (608338).
The 271-amino acid, 31-kD OTB1 protein contains UB-interaction motifs
(UIMs) and UB-associated (UBA) domains, as well as putative nuclear
localization signals and a consensus LxxLL motif. RT-PCR and Western
blot analyses revealed wide expression of OTB1, with 2 isoforms in
leukocytes.

By PCR and immunoblot analysis, Soares et al. (2004) identified an
815-bp OTB1 isoform, which was expressed ubiquitously, and a 950-bp
isoform, which was expressed only in lymphoid tissue. The 815-bp isoform
encodes the 31-kD protein reported by Balakirev et al. (2003), whereas
the 950-bp isoform encodes a 35-kD, 315-amino acid protein, OTB1ARF1
(OTB1 alternative reading frame-1), that lacks the asp and cys residues
in the OTU cysteine proteinase catalytic core and retains only the
C-terminal flanking region of the OTU domain. The OTB1ARF1 transcript is
produced from the same transcription start site as OTB1 but uses an AUG
codon located in exon 2 and in a different reading frame from that of
OTB1. In addition, there is no splicing between exons 4 and 5 in
OTB1ARF1, which causes a frameshift back to the same reading frame as
OTB1.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Soares et al. (2004) showed that GRAIL
(RNF128; 300439) binds to OTB1. Although OTB1 was found to have DUB
activity, it failed to deubiquitinate polyubiquitinated GRAIL.
Immunoprecipitation and coexpression analysis indicated that OTB1, but
not OTB1ARF1, binds to the C-terminal UCH catalytic domain of USP8
(603158) in a trimolecular complex with GRAIL. Soares et al. (2004)
studied cells from T-cell receptor-transgenic mice expressing the
alternative forms of OTB1. OTB1-expressing cells contained negligible
amounts of Grail, proliferated well, and produced large amounts of
interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) after antigenic stimulation. In contrast,
cells expressing OTB1ARF1 contained large amounts of Grail and were
functionally anergic, proliferating poorly and not producing Il2. Soares
et al. (2004) concluded that the balance of OTB1 and OTB1ARF1 in T cells
is an important factor that regulates GRAIL stability and the outcome of
immune responses in secondary lymphoid organs.

Nakada et al. (2010) reported that OTUB1, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is
an inhibitor of double stranded break induced chromatin ubiquitination.
Surprisingly, they found that OTUB1 suppresses RNF168 (612688)-dependent
polyubiquitination independently of its catalytic activity. OTUB1 does
so by binding to and inhibiting UBC13 (UBE2N; 603679), the cognate E2
enzyme for RNF168. Nakada et al. (2010) suggested that this unusual mode
of regulation is unlikely to be limited to UBC13 because analysis of
OTUB1-associated proteins revealed that OTUB1 binds to E2s of the UBE2D
and UBE2E subfamilies. Finally, OTUB1 depletion mitigates the
double-stranded break repair defect associated with defective ATM
(607585) signaling, indicating that pharmacologic targeting of the
OTUB1-UBC13 interaction might enhance the DNA damage response.

Using immunoblot analysis, Lin et al. (2009) demonstrated expression of
GRAIL in naive mouse and human CD4 (186940) T lymphocytes. They found
that, upon CD4 T-cell activation, OTUB1 was expressed and GRAIL was
degraded, allowing proliferation to proceed. Preventing OTUB1 expression
with CTLA4 (123890)-Ig, anti-IL2, or rapamycin, all of which target MTOR
(FRAP1; 601231), resulted in maintenance of GRAIL and inhibition of CD4
T-cell proliferation. Lin et al. (2009) concluded that a pathway
sequentially links CD28 (186760) costimulation, IL2 expression, IL2R
(IL2RA; 147730) signaling, and MTOR activation as important requirements
for naive CD4 T-cell proliferation through the regulation of OTUB1 and
GRAIL expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Soares et al. (2004) determined that the OTB1 gene contains 7 exons.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Wiener et al. (2012) described structural and biochemical studies
elucidating how OTUB1 inhibits UBC13 and other E2 enzymes. They
unexpectedly found that OTUB1 binding to UBC13-Ub (the ubiquitin
thiolester) is allosterically regulated by free ubiquitin, which binds
to a second site in OTUB1 and increases its affinity for UBC13-Ub, while
at the same time disrupting interactions with UEV1A (602995) in a manner
that depends on the OTUB1 N terminus. Crystal structures of an
OTUB1-UBC13 complex and of OTUB1 bound to ubiquitin aldehyde and a
chemical UBC13-Ub conjugate showed that binding of free ubiquitin to
OTUB1 triggers conformational changes in the OTU domain and formation of
a ubiquitin-binding helix in the N terminus, thus promoting binding of
the conjugated donor ubiquitin in UBC13-Ub to OTUB1. The donor ubiquitin
thus cannot interact with the E2 enzyme, which has been shown to be
important for ubiquitin transfer. The N-terminal helix of OTUB1 is
positioned to interfere with UEV1A binding to UBC13, as well as with
attack on the thiolester by an acceptor ubiquitin, thereby inhibiting
K63Ub synthesis. OTUB1 binding also occludes the RING E3 binding site on
UBC13, thus providing a further component of inhibition. Wiener et al.
(2012) concluded that the general features of the inhibition mechanism
explained how OTUB1 inhibits other E2 enzymes in a noncatalytic manner.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Balakirev et al. (2003) mapped the OTUB1
gene to chromosome 11q13.1.

607718	TITLE *607718 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 6; SYT6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptotagmins, such as SYT6, share a common domain structure that
includes a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region composed of 2
C2 domains. Some synaptotagmins are involved in synaptic membrane
fusion, while others have a more general function in endocytosis. For
further information on synaptotagmins, see 185605.

CLONING

Li et al. (1995) cloned rat Syt6. RT-PCR detected expression of Syt6 in
all tissues examined. By in vitro assay of recombinant protein, Li et
al. (1995) showed that Syt6 bound adaptor protein-2 (see 601026) in a
Ca(2+)-independent manner. However, unlike several other synaptotagmins,
Syt6 did not bind phospholipids, and binding to syntaxin (see 186590)
was Ca(2+)-independent.

MAPPING

The International Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SYT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22846).

612774	TITLE *612774 TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 46; TAS2R46
;;T2R46;;
T2R54
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R46 belongs to the large TAS2R receptor family. TAS2Rs are expressed
on the surface of taste receptor cells and mediate the perception of
bitterness through a G protein-coupled second messenger pathway (Conte
et al., 2002). For further information on TAS2Rs, see 604791.

CLONING

By screening the human genome for sequences related to TAS2Rs, Conte et
al. (2002) cloned TAS2R46, which they called T2R54. The deduced
309-amino acid protein contains the 7-transmembrane structure and short
N- and C-terminal domains conserved in TAS2Rs. The intracellular domains
share significant conservation with other TAS2R family members. TAS2R46
shares highest sequence similarity with TAS2R43 (612668) and TAS2R44
(TAS2R31; 612669).

GENE FUNCTION

Shah et al. (2009) found that motile cilia emerging from human airway
epithelial cells express sensory bitter taste receptors, including T2R4
(604869), T2R43, T2R38 (607751), and T2R46. Only ciliated epithelial
cells expressed these receptors, and they specifically localized in
cilia. The receptors appeared to localize preferentially at different
places along the cilium. T2R46 appeared to reside proximally in cilia.
Bitter compounds increased the intracellular calcium ion concentration
and stimulated ciliary beat frequency. Shah et al. (2009) found that
alpha-gustducin (139395) and the enzyme phospholipase C-beta-2 (PLCB2;
604114) are also expressed in airway epithelia. Alpha-gustducin resides
in the cilia, and PLCB2 appears to sit below the cilia in the apical
portion of the cell. Shah et al. (2009) concluded that airway epithelia
contain a cell-autonomous system in which motile cilia both sense
noxious substances entering airways and initiate a defensive mechanism
to eliminate the offending compound. Hence, like primary cilia,
classical motile cilia also contain sensors to detect the external
environment.

Brockhoff et al. (2010) found that exchanging 2 residues within
C-terminal transmembrane domain-7 of the related human taste receptors
TAS2R46, which is activated by strychnine, and TAS2R31, which is
activated by aristolochic acid, was sufficient to invert their agonist
selectivity. Transfer of functionally relevant amino acids in TAS2R46 to
the corresponding positions of TAS2R43 and TAS2R31 resulted in
pharmacologic properties indistinguishable from parental TAS2R46.

MAPPING

By screening of a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid panel, Conte et al.
(2002) assigned the TAS2R46 gene to chromosome 12, within the cluster on
12p13.2 that also contains TAS2R43 and TAS2R44.

603085	TITLE *603085 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 31 (COPPER TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 1; SLC31A1
;;COPPER TRANSPORTER 1; COPT1; CTR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Copper is an element essential for life, but excessive copper can be
toxic or even lethal to the cell. Therefore, cells have developed
sophisticated ways to maintain a critical copper balance, with the
intake, export, and intracellular compartmentalization or buffering of
copper strictly regulated. The 2 related genes ATP7A (300011) and ATP7B
(606882), responsible for the human diseases Menkes syndrome (309400)
and Wilson disease (277900), respectively, are involved in copper
export. In S. cerevisiae, the copper uptake genes CTR1, CTR2, and CTR3
have been identified, and in human the CTR1 and CTR2 (603088) genes have
been identified.

CLONING

Zhou and Gitschier (1997) isolated a human cDNA encoding COPT1, which
they called CTR1, by functional complementation of the yeast
high-affinity copper uptake mutant ctr1. The deduced 190-amino acid
human CTR1 protein is similar to yeast CTR1 and Arabidopsis COPT1, a
copper transporter also isolated by functional complementation of yeast
ctr1. All 3 predicted proteins have 3 transmembrane domains and an N
terminus that is rich in methionine and serine residues; the N terminus
of human CTR1 is also abundant in histidines. Northern blot analysis
detected 2 major CTR1 transcripts of approximately 2 kb and 5.5 kb and a
less abundant transcript of about 8.5 kb in all human organs and tissues
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhou and Gitschier (1997) proposed that CTR1 is a high-affinity copper
uptake gene because it could complement the yeast ctr1 mutation, it
could rescue multiple defects in ctr1 yeast, its expression in ctr1
yeast increased the concentration of cellular copper, and its
overexpression in yeast led to a vulnerability to the toxicity of copper
overload.

Moller et al. (2000) found that cells expressing CTR1 but not those
expressing CTR2 showed a dramatic hyperaccumulation of radioactive
copper, comparable to that seen in fibroblasts from Menkes disease
patients. However, in contrast to the Menkes syndrome fibroblasts, the
CTR1-expressing fibroblasts had an efflux rate similar to normal
fibroblasts.

By cross-linking CTR1 transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, Lee et al.
(2002) demonstrated that CTR1 forms a homotrimer as part of a copper
transport channel. Functional assays revealed that it stimulates the
initial rate of radiolabeled copper uptake. CTR1 transports copper with
high affinity in a time-dependent and saturable manner and is
copper-specific. Transport is an energy-independent process and is
stimulated by extracellular acidic pH and high K+ concentrations.

Using pulse-chase labeling followed by immunoprecipitation, Klomp et al.
(2002) found that endogenous CTR1 is synthesized in HeLa cells as a
28-kD precursor containing N-linked oligosaccharides, and it is
processed into a 35-kD mature protein. Immunofluorescent microscopy
showed that the subcellular localization of CTR1 differed between cell
types. In some cells, including HeLa, lung, and hepatocellular carcinoma
cell lines, it predominantly localized in a vesicular perinuclear
compartment, while in other cells, including choriocarcinoma and colon
carcinoma cell lines, it localized predominantly at the plasma membrane.
The localization of CTR1 was not influenced by copper concentration, but
inhibition of endocytosis caused a partial redistribution of CTR1 to the
cell surface of HeLa cells.

Using accessibility of epitopes to antibody before or after cell
permeabilization, Eisses and Kaplan (2002) determined that CTR1,
expressed at the surface of transfected sf9 insect cells, has an
extracellular N terminus and an intracellular C terminus. Using
mutagenic analysis, they determined that neither of the 2 cys residues,
cys161 and cys189, play a role in copper uptake, and that glycosylation
of CTR1 is not required for function.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURE {1:Aller and Unger (2006)} reported the 6-angstrom

projection structure of human CTR1. The projection of CTR1 revealed a
symmetrical trimer less than 40 angstroms wide. The center 3-fold axis
of each trimer formed a region of very low electron density likely to be
involved in copper translocation. The structure of the putative pore was
more closely related to channel proteins than to typical primary and
secondary active transporters.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Moller et al. (2000) determined that the
CTR1 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

Zhou and Gitschier (1997) found that the 3-prime untranslated region of
the human CTR1 gene contains a CA repeat marker (D9S262) that had
previously been mapped to 9q31-q32. By analysis of YAC clones, they
showed that CTR1 and CTR2, which is also located in 9q31-q32, are not
adjacent genes. Moller et al. (2000) identified an apparent CTR1
pseudogene (CTR1P) on 3q25-q27.

ANIMAL MODEL

To test the hypothesis that CTR1 is required for copper delivery to
mammalian cells, Kuo et al. (2001) inactivated the Ctr1 gene in mice by
targeted mutagenesis. They observed early embryonic lethality in
homozygous mutant embryos and a deficiency in copper uptake in the
brains of heterozygous animals. A study of the spatial and temporal
expression pattern of Ctr1 during mouse development and adulthood
further showed that Ctr1 is ubiquitously transcribed with highest
expression observed in the specialized epithelia of the choroid plexus
and renal tubules and in connective tissues of the eye, ovary, and
testis. Similarly, Lee et al. (2001) showed that the mouse Ctr1 gene
encodes a component of the copper transport machinery and that mice
heterozygous for Ctr1 exhibit tissue-specific defects in copper
accumulation and in the activities of copper-dependent enzymes. Mice
completely deficient for Ctr1 exhibited profound growth and
developmental defects and died in utero in midgestation.

610528	TITLE *610528 CHROMODOMAIN HELICASE DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 8; CHD8
;;AXIS DUPLICATION INHIBITOR; DUPLIN;;
KIAA1564
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (2000) cloned CHD8, which they designated KIAA1564. The
deduced protein contains 1,417 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
moderate expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific brain
regions examined.

Sakamoto et al. (2000) cloned rat Chd8, which they called Duplin. The
deduced 749-amino acid protein was expressed mainly in the nuclear
fraction of transfected COS cells.

Ishihara et al. (2006) cloned mouse Chd8. The deduced 2,582-amino acid
protein has 2 chromodomains, followed by a central helicase/ATPase
domain and 2 C-terminal BRK domains. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous Chd8 expression in mouse tissues, with highest levels in
heart and testis. Western blot analysis of HeLa cells detected
endogenous CHD8 at an apparent molecular mass of 240 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakamoto et al. (2000) found that rat Duplin bound directly to the
armadillo repeats of beta-catenin (see CTNNB1; 116806) in the nuclei of
mammalian cells, thereby inhibiting binding of TCF4 (TCF7L2; 602228) to
beta-catenin and beta-catenin-dependent activation of TCF4. Expression
of Duplin in Xenopus embryos inhibited axis formation and beta
catenin-dependent axis duplication, and it countered the ability of
beta-catenin to rescue ventralizing phenotypes induced by ultraviolet
irradiation. Sakamoto et al. (2000) concluded that Duplin is a nuclear
protein that negatively regulates Wnt (see 164820) signaling by binding
beta-catenin.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse brain cDNA library, followed by
studies in COS cells, Kobayashi et al. (2002) found that importin-alpha
(see KPNA2; 600685) bound a cluster of basic amino acids in rat Duplin.
Interaction with importin-alpha caused Duplin to translocate to the
nucleus, and nuclear localization of Duplin was essential for inhibition
of Wnt-dependent activation of TCF4 in mammalian cells and
ventralization in Xenopus embryos. Additional experiments in Xenopus
embryos showed that Duplin also inhibited the Wnt signaling pathway
downstream of beta-catenin target genes.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and pull-down assays, Ishihara et al.
(2006) found that the C-terminal region of mouse Chd8 interacted with
the zinc finger domain of Ctcf (604167). Chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis of a human hepatoma cell line revealed that CHD8 was present at
CTCF target sites, such as the differentially methylated region of H19
(103280), the locus control region of beta-globin (141900), and the
promoter regions of the BRCA1 (113705) and MYC (190080) genes.
Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated an endogenous complex of CHD8
and CTCF in HeLa cells. Knockdown of CHD8 in HeLa cells by RNA
interference abolished the CTCF-dependent insulator activity of the H19
differentially methylated region, leading to reactivation of imprinted
IGF2 (147470) from the maternal chromosome. Lack of CHD8 affected CpG
methylation and histone acetylation around the CTCF-binding sites, which
are adjacent to heterochromatin, of the BRCA1 and MYC genes. Ishihara et
al. (2006) concluded that CTCF-CHD8 has a role in insulation and
epigenetic regulation at active insulator sites.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid library screen, Batsukh et al. (2010) identified
CHD8 as an interacting partner of CHD7 (608892), mutations in which
cause the autosomal dominant malformation syndrome CHARGE (214800). In a
direct yeast 2-hybrid system, the CHD7-CHD8 interaction was disrupted by
CHD7 missense mutations found in CHARGE patients, including gly2108 to
arg (608892.0011), whereas in coimmunoprecipitation studies disruption
of the CHD7-CHD8 interaction by the mutations could not be observed. The
authors hypothesized that CHD7 and CHD8 proteins interact directly and
indirectly via additional linker proteins. Disruption of the direct
CHD7-CHD8 interaction may change the conformation of a putative large
CHD7-CHD8 complex and could be a disease mechanism in CHARGE syndrome.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nishiyama et al. (2004) determined that the mouse Chd8 gene contains 9
exons and spans about 13 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CHD8
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP G36016).

Nishiyama et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Duplin gene to chromosome 14.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

O'Roak et al. (2012) performed whole-exome sequencing for parent-child
trios exhibiting sporadic autism spectrum disorders, including 189 new
trios and 20 that were previously reported (O'Roak et al., 2011). In
addition, O'Roak et al. (2012) sequenced the exomes of 50 unaffected
sibs corresponding to 31 of the new and 19 of the previously reported
trios, for a total of 677 individual exomes from 209 families. In
proband exomes, O'Roak et al. (2012) found 2 de novo disruptive
mutations in CHD8, a nonsense mutation and a frameshift indel.

Sanders et al. (2012) combined all de novo events in their sample with
those identified in the study of O'Roak et al. (2012) and observed from
a total of 414 probands that the CHD8 gene carried 2 highly disruptive
mutations.

In a study of exonic de novo mutations in autism spectrum disorders (see
209850), Neale et al. (2012) identified 3 loss-of-function mutations in
the CHD8 gene among 935 cases and no mutations in CHD8 among 870
controls.

O'Roak et al. (2012) identified 9 de novo mutations in the CHD8 gene
among 2,446 autism spectrum probands. Seven were nonsense or frameshift
mutations, 1 was a splice site mutation, and 1 was an in-frame deletion.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nishiyama et al. (2004) found that development of Duplin -/- mouse
embryos was arrested at gastrulation, with the embryos manifesting
massive apoptosis. In contrast, Duplin +/- mice appeared normal and were
fertile. Expression of beta-catenin target genes was not increased in
Duplin -/- embryos, suggesting that the lack of Duplin did not result in
constitutive activation of Wnt signaling during embryogenesis.

606210	TITLE *606210 SELENOPROTEIN N, 1; SEPN1
;;SELN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Selenium deficiency can interfere with normal embryonic development and
fertility or promote the occurrence of certain cancers and viral
diseases. Selenocysteine, the major form of selenium in animals, is
directly involved in the catalytic reaction of selenoproteins.
Selenocysteine is encoded by an in-frame UGA codon. Avoidance of a
translational stop requires the presence of a selenocysteine insertion
sequence (SECIS), a hairpin conserved in the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR) of all selenoprotein mRNAs. By searching an EST database for
sequences that can adopt a SECIS-like secondary structure, followed by
glutathione peroxidase functional analysis, further database searching,
and 5-prime RACE, Lescure et al. (1999) identified a partial cDNA
encoding SEPN1, which they termed SELN. Sequence analysis detected a
SECIS in the 3-prime UTR of SEPN1. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of a 4.5-kb SEPN1 transcript, with highest levels
in pancreas, ovary, prostate, and spleen. Hemagglutinin-tagged SEPN1 was
expressed as a 60-kD protein in the presence of a wildtype SECIS element
but not a mutant SECIS element. Lescure et al. (1999) concluded that the
3-prime UTR is a repository of functional RNA motifs instrumental in
posttranscriptional control.

By 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001)
characterized the full-length SEPN1 cDNA. They found that SEPN1 produces
a 4.5-kb transcript with an open reading frame encoding a 590-amino acid
protein. EST database searches and RT-PCR experiments predicted that
there are 2 isoforms of SEPN1. Isoform 1 corresponds to the full-length
transcript, whereas exon 3 is spliced out in isoform 2. Both transcripts
were detected in skeletal muscle, brain, lung, and placenta, but isoform
2 was always predominant. The exon 3 sequence corresponds to an Alu
cassette and contains a second in-frame selenocysteine codon.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) determined
that the SEPN1 gene contains 13 exons and spans 18.5 kb.

MAPPING

By PAC analysis, Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) mapped the SEPN1 gene to
1p36-p35, where the locus for rigid spine muscular dystrophy-1 (RSMD1;
602771) maps.

GENE FUNCTION

Using polyclonal antibodies directed against SEPN1 and cDNA constructs
encoding the 2 isoforms, Petit et al. (2003) showed that the main SEPN1
gene product corresponds to a 70-kD protein containing a single
selenocysteine residue. Subcellular fractionation experiments and
endoglycosidase H sensitivity indicated that SEPN1 is a glycoprotein
localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Immunofluorescence
analyses confirmed this subcellular localization, and GFP fusion
experiments demonstrated the presence of an ER-addressing and -retention
signal within the N terminus. SEPN1 was present at a high level in
several human fetal tissues and at a lower level in adult tissues,
including skeletal muscle. Its high expression in cultured myoblasts was
also downregulated in differentiating myotubes, suggesting a role for
SEPN1 in early development and in cell proliferation or regeneration.

Jurynec et al. (2008) found that the zebrafish ortholog of Sepn1 was
required for development of the slow muscle fiber lineage.
Downregulation of Sepn1 resulted in disorganized muscle myofibrils and
prominent Z-band anomalies not seen in wildtype muscle. Ryr1a (see RYR1;
180901) and Ryr3 (180903) were also required for formation of
normal-appearing slow muscle cells. Sepn1 stably associated with Ryr
proteins and functioned as a modifier of Ryr calcium flux activity and
redox responsiveness.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The association between selenium deficiency and muscular dystrophy in
livestock suggests a role for selenium in the pathophysiology of
striated muscles. In humans, selenium deficiency is associated with a
cardiomyopathy known as Keshan disease, reported from selenium-deficient
areas of China (Ge et al., 1983). In 10 families with RSMD1,
Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified 2 frameshift, 1 nonsense, and 3
missense mutations in the SEPN1 gene. The nonsense mutation
(606210.0002) identified in a French family transformed the
selenocysteine codon into a stop codon, preventing selenocysteine
incorporation and leading to a shorter protein. The missense mutations
changed residues that are conserved in vertebrates. Two of these mutated
residues were clustered in 1 region, the third being in close proximity
to the selenocysteine residue.

Multiminicore disease is an autosomal recessive congenital myopathy
characterized by the presence of multiple, short core lesions (known as
minicores) in most muscle fibers. On the basis of clinical and
morphologic data, Ferreiro et al. (2002) suspected a relationship
between classic multiminicore disease and RSMD1 due to mutation in the
SEPN1 gene. A genomewide screen, followed by the analysis of 1p36
microsatellite markers in 27 informative families with multiminicore
disease, demonstrated linkage to the RSMD1 locus in 8 families. All
showed axial myopathy with scoliosis and respiratory failure, consistent
with the most severe end of the classic multiminicore disease spectrum;
spinal rigidity was evident in some, but not all, patients. Screening of
SEPN1 in the 8 families that showed linkage and in 14 patients with
classic sporadic disease revealed 9 mutations affecting 17 patients in
12 families; 6 were novel mutations and 3 had been described in patients
with RSMD1. Analysis of 3 deltoid biopsy specimens from patients with
typical RSMD revealed a wide myopathologic variability, ranging from a
dystrophic to a congenital myopathy pattern. A variable proportion of
minicores was found in all samples. The authors concluded that RSMD1 and
the most severe form of classic multiminicore disease are the same
entity.

Clarke et al. (2006) identified a homozygous mutation in the SEPN1 gene
(606210.0008) in patients with congenital fiber-type disproportion
(CFTD; 255310), a congenital muscular dystrophy that has clinical
features similar to those observed in RSMD1.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, GLY273GLU

In affected members of 2 Iranian and 3 Turkish families with rigid spine
muscular dystrophy-1 (602771), Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified a
G-to-A transition at nucleotide 817 of the SEPN1 gene, causing a
gly273-to-glu substitution.

.0002
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, SEC462TER

In a French family with rigid spine muscular dystrophy (602771),
Moghadaszadeh et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide
1385 of the SEPN1 gene. The mutation changed the selenocysteine (sec)
codon (TGA) into a stop codon (TAA), preventing selenocysteine
incorporation and leading to a shorter protein.

.0003
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, MET1VAL

In 3 unrelated families of Italian, Belgian, and German origin with
multiminicore disease (602771), Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified a
homozygous A-to-G transition in the start codon of the SEPN1 gene,
resulting in a met1-to-val (M1V) substitution. In the family from
Germany consanguinity was known. Two children in the family from Italy
were affected.

.0004
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, ARG466GLN

In patients with rigid spine muscular dystrophy (602771), Moghadaszadeh
et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 1397 of the SEPN1 gene, resulting in an arg466-to-gln (R466Q)
substitution.

In patients with multiminicore disease, Ferreiro et al. (2002)
identified the R466Q mutation in compound heterozygous state with a
trp453-to-ser (W453S) substitution resulting from a G-to-C transversion
at nucleotide 1358 (606210.0005). They also identified the R466Q
mutation in a compound heterozygous state with a 1-bp insertion (A) at
nucleotide 713 (606210.0006), resulting in a frameshift.

Jurynec et al. (2008) found that ryanodine receptors (RYRs; see 180901)
in muscle lysates prepared from muscle from a patient with congenital
myopathy and the R466Q mutation showed reduced ryanodine binding
compared with control tissue. Addition of wildtype zebrafish Sepn1
partially restored the binding capacity of diseased muscle lysates and
fully restored the ability of human RYRs from diseased muscle lysates to
respond to changes in the redox potential of the binding environment.

RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, SEC462GLY

In a Portuguese family in which 2 children had multiminicore disease
(602771), Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a T-to-G
transversion at nucleotide 1384 in exon 10 of the SEPN1 gene, resulting
in a sec462-to-gly (U462G) substitution.

.0008
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
MYOPATHY, CONGENITAL, WITH FIBER-TYPE DISPROPORTION, INCLUDED
SEPN1, GLY315SER

In 2 unrelated families with multiminicore disease (602771) from Belgium
and the U.K. that shared identical RSMD1 haplotypes, suggesting a
founder effect, Ferreiro et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a
943G-A transition in the SEPN1 gene, resulting in a gly315-to-ser
(G315S) substitution. A German patient with sporadic multiminicore
disease presented the same mutation in the compound heterozygous state
with R466Q (606210.0004).

Venance et al. (2005) identified the homozygous G315S mutation in a
patient with rigid spine muscular dystrophy who presented at age 26
years with cor pulmonale characterized by rapidly progressive
respiratory and right heart failure with cough, orthopnea, and daytime
sleepiness. Two sibs who were heterozygous carriers of the mutation had
mild neck restriction. Venance et al. (2005) emphasized the importance
of early nocturnal ventilatory assistance in these patients.

Clarke et al. (2006) reported 2 sisters, ages 32 and 30, respectively,
with a diagnosis of congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD; 255310)
who were homozygous for the G315S substitution. Skeletal muscle biopsies
showed that type 1 fibers were at least 12% smaller than type 2 fibers,
and there was no evidence of multiminicore disease or other findings
typical of RSMD1. Clinically, the women had a severe congenital myopathy
with truncal hypotonia in infancy, progressive scoliosis, progressive
respiratory impairment, and osteopenia. One woman was wheelchair-bound
and had had bilateral hip fractures in her twenties. Three additional
patients from another family with congenital muscular dystrophy were
homozygous for the G315S substitution; however, skeletal muscle biopsy
from 1 of these patients showed only nonspecific myopathy and did not
fulfill the pathologic criteria for CFTD. All 5 patients had abnormal
glucose tolerance tests and showed biochemical abnormalities suggesting
insulin resistance.

.0009
RIGID SPINE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 1
SEPN1, 92-BP DEL

In 4 affected patients with Mallory-body myopathy (602771) who came from
a genetic isolate in northern Germany (Goebel et al., 1980), Ferreiro et
al. (2004) identified a homozygous 92-bp deletion in the SEPN1 gene
starting 19 bp upstream of exon 1 and including the first 73 bp of exon
1 (del92, -19/+73). The deletion caused loss of the translation starting
codon. The parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

600233	TITLE *600233 GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID RECEPTOR, GAMMA-3; GABRG3
;;GABA-A RECEPTOR, GAMMA-3 POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are a family of proteins
involved in the GABAergic neurotransmission of the mammalian central
nervous system. GABRG3 is a member of the GABA-A receptor gene family of
heteromeric pentameric ligand-gated ion channels through which GABA, the
major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, acts. GABA-A
receptors are the site of action of a number of important pharmacologic
agents including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and ethanol (summary by
Whiting et al., 1999).

For additional general information about the GABA-A receptor gene
family, see GABRA1 (137160).

CLONING

Greger et al. (1995) cloned the gene for the gamma-3 subunit.

MAPPING

Russek and Farb (1994) stated that the GABRG3 is located on 15q11-q13 in
a cluster with GABRA5 (137142) and GABRB3 (137192). Thus, there is an
alpha/beta/gamma cluster of GABA receptor subunit subtype genes on 3
chromosomes, 15, 5, and 3. Russek and Farb (1994) suggested that these
may have originated from chromosome 15 because the centromere of that
chromosome is associated with increased amounts of satellite DNA and
translocations occur more frequently around such centromeres. Thus, it
can be speculated that the ancestral GABA-A receptor gene cluster formed
on chromosome 15 and thereafter spawned the clusters on chromosomes 4
and 5.

Greger et al. (1995) showed that the GABRG3 gene is 35 kb from the
alpha-5 subunit gene which, in turn, is about 100 kb from the beta-3
subunit locus. The latter is located at the centromeric end of the
cluster and is transcribed in the opposite direction of GABRG3 and
GABRA5. This orientation of the cluster is opposite that reported by
Russek and Farb (1994). Greger et al. (1995) confirmed that the GABRG3
gene maps to 15q11-q13 and they verified the order of the genes by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coding SNPs within the GABA receptor gene cluster on chromosome
15q11-q13, Hogart et al. (2007) demonstrated that the GABRG3, GABRB3,
and GABRA5 genes were biallelically expressed in the cerebral cortex of

607797	TITLE *607797 SMALL NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN, 40-KD; SNRNP40
;;U5 snRNP-SPECIFIC PROTEIN, 40-KD;;
SPLICING FACTOR, 38-KD; SPF38;;
PRPF8-BINDING PROTEIN; PRPF8BP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNRNP40 is a component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)
particle. The U5 snRNP is part of the spliceosome, a multiprotein
complex involved in the removal of introns from nuclear pre-mRNAs
(Achsel et al., 1998).

CLONING

By 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis of spliceosomes from HeLa cell
nuclear extracts, followed by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry and
comparison with EST databases, Neubauer et al. (1998) cloned SPF38.
SPF38 has a calculated molecular mass of 38.4 kD and shows an apparent
molecular mass of 30 kD in 2-dimensional gels.

By microsequencing tryptic fragments and EST database searching, Achsel
et al. (1998) cloned SPF38. The deduced 357-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 39.3 kD. Except for 63 N-terminal amino
acids, the entire SPF38 protein is made up of 7 WD40 repeats. Highly
homologous protein sequences were found in rat, mouse, fruit fly, and
plant EST databases.

GENE FUNCTION

By sedimentation analysis, radioimmunoprecipitations, and Far Western
(overlay) analysis, Achsel et al. (1998) determined that SPF38 interacts
directly with PRPF8 (607300).

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the SNRNP40 gene to chromosome 1p35.2 based on an
alignment of the SNRNP40 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF090988) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

614953	TITLE *614953 SCHLAFEN FAMILY, MEMBER 11; SLFN11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Schlafen (SFLN) family contains 9 mouse and 6 human genes that
encode proteins with a conserved N terminus containing a putative AAA
ATPase domain. Longer SLFN proteins, such as SLFN11, have C-terminal
motifs resembling DNA/RNA helicase domains. Studies in mouse have
implicated SLFN proteins in regulation of cell growth and T-cell
development (summary by Geserick et al. (2004) and Li et al. (2012)).

CLONING

Geserick et al. (2004) identified mouse Slfn5 (614952), Slfn8, Slfn9,
and Slfn10, which encode proteins that share significant homology with
mouse Slfn1 through Slfn4 in their N-terminal halves, but contain unique
C-terminal extensions with motifs homologous to DNA/RNA helicases.
Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10 share 85 to 87% amino acid identity with one
another, whereas Slfn5 is more distantly related to the former group,
sharing 40% identity.

Van Zuylen et al. (2011) noted that human SLFN11 and SLFN13 (614957) are
orthologous to mouse Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10.

Li et al. (2012) stated that the 901-amino acid human SLFN11 protein has
an AAA domain in its N-terminal half and a putative helicase sequence in
its C-terminal half. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that SLFN5 and SLFN11
were the most prominently expressed SLFN family members in several human
cell lines.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the SLFN11 gene to chromosome 17q12 based on an
alignment of the SLFN11 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC052586) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Bustos et al. (2009) found that the SLFN genes are clustered within the
same orthologous region flanked by the UNC45 (UNC45B; 611220) and PEX12
(601758) genes in all mammalian genomes examined. The human and mouse
SLFN clusters are located on chromosomes 17 and 11, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2012) noted that levels of mouse SLFN proteins are elevated
after infection with Brucella or Listeria. Using quantitative RT-PCR,
they showed that lipopolysaccharide, poly-IC, or interferon (IFN)-alpha
(147660)/beta (147640) treatment of murine macrophages resulted in
induction of several SLFN genes. Treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts
with IFN-beta, poly-IC, or poly-dAdT revealed similar induction of SLFN
genes, including SLFN5 and SLFN11. Li et al. (2012) found that human
SLFN11, but not SLFN5, potently and specifically abrogated production of
retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423),
and diminished the number of viral particles released from cells. The
inhibitory activity resided in the 579-residue N-terminal half of
SLFN11, which includes the AAA domain. Rather than affecting early steps
of the retroviral infection cycle, including reverse transcription,
integration, and transcription, SLFN11 selectively inhibited expression
of viral proteins in a codon-usage-dependent manner. SLFN11 bound tRNA
and counteracted changes in the tRNA pool elicited by HIV. Li et al.
(2012) concluded that SLFN11 is a potent, IFN-inducible restriction
factor against retroviruses that mediates its antiviral effects on the
basis of codon usage discrimination.

- Putative Mouse Orthologs of SLFN11

Using Northern blot analysis, Geserick et al. (2004) detected expression
of most mouse SLFN genes examined in Listeria monocytogenes-infected
mouse splenocytes, with little or no expression in uninfected mouse
cells. Ifngr (107470) was required for Slfn5, Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10
upregulation. Further analysis showed that mouse SLFNs were
differentially regulated in developing thymocytes, in activated
peripheral T cells, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or interferon-gamma
(IFNG; 147570)-activated macrophages, or during terminal myeloid
differentiation of M1 leukemia cells. Transgenic expression in mice
revealed that dysregulated expression of Slfn8 negatively influenced
thymocyte development and impaired the response of peripheral T cells to
T-cell receptor (see 186880)-mediated stimulation. Geserick et al.
(2004) concluded that SLFN genes are integrated into regulatory networks
that control T-cell development and activation.

EVOLUTION

Bustos et al. (2009) used genomic and phylogenetic studies to
investigate the evolution and role of the SLFN gene family. They found
that the SLFN family is widely distributed in mammals, with 4 major
clades that underwent lineage-specific expansions or contractions in
various orders, including primates and rodents. Bustos et al. (2009)
also identified SLFN family members in Chondrichthyes and Amphibia. They
found evidence that positive selection has acted on many SLFN genes. A
member of the SLFN family was horizontally transferred from mouse to
orthopoxviruses, where the authors hypothesized it plays a role in
allowing the virus to survive host defense mechanisms. The viral SLFN
sequences are evolving under purifying selection, indicating their
functional relevance.

Van Zuylen et al. (2011) noted that only 2 SLFN family members, SLFN5
and SLFN14 (614958), have direct orthologs in mouse and human,
consistent with rapid evolution of the SLFN family across mammalian
species. Human SLFN12 (614955) and SLFN12L (614956) have 4 orthologs in
mice (Slfn1, Slfn2, Slfn3, and Slfn4), and human SLFN11 and SLFN13 have
3 orthologs in mice (Slfn8, Slfn9, and Slfn10).

600339	TITLE *600339 HEPATOMA-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR; HDGF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nakamura et al. (1994) purified a novel hepatoma-derived growth factor
from the conditioned medium of human hepatoma-derived cell line HuH-7.
Molecular cloning of a cDNA from the cDNA library of the same cell line
was done on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The cDNA
was 2.4 kb long and the deduced amino acid sequence contained 240 amino
acids without a signal peptide-like N-terminal hydrophobic sequence. The
primary sequence shared homology with the high mobility group-1 protein
(163905); they showed 23.4% amino acid identity and 35.6% amino acid
similarity.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence study, Nakamura et al. (1994) showed that HDGF is
localized in the cytoplasm of hepatoma cells and northern blots showed
that it is expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues and tumor cell
lines. Nakamura et al. (1994) suggested that it is a novel
heparin-binding protein with mitogenic activity for fibroblasts.

MAPPING

By PCR screening of a commercial monochromosomal hybrid panel, Wanschura
et al. (1996) mapped HDGF to the X chromosome. By FISH, they refined the
localization to Xq25. Subsequently, however, the International Radiation
Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HDGF gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP
SHGC-132090). Amberger (2007) refined the localization to 1q21 based on
an alignment of the HDGF sequence (GenBank GENBANK D16431) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

614638	TITLE *614638 DESUMOYLATING ISOPEPTIDASE 2; DESI2
;;PPPDE PEPTIDASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; PPPDE1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The modification of proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifier, or SUMO
(see SUMO1; 601912), is crucial for the regulation of diverse cellular
processes. DESI2 is predicted to have a papain-like fold and to function
as a cysteine protease that removes SUMO from SUMO-modified proteins
(Shin et al., 2012).

CLONING

Shin et al. (2012) cloned mouse Desi2, which encodes a deduced 194-amino
acid protein with a central isopeptidase domain. By database analysis,
they identified the human and rat orthologs. Western blot analysis
detected Desi2 in all mouse tissues examined. Epitope-tagged Desi2
localized mainly to the cytoplasm of transfected 293T cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the DESI2 gene to chromosome 1q44 based on an
alignment of the DESI2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF151904) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

186760	TITLE *186760 ANTIGEN CD28; CD28
;;T-CELL ANTIGEN CD28;;
Tp44
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD28 costimulation is essential for CD4 (186940)-positive T-cell
proliferation, survival, interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) production, and
T-helper type-2 (Th2) development.

CLONING

Monoclonal antibodies recognize 3 antigens, CD3 (186790), CD2 (186990),
and CD28 (Tp44), that cause human T cells to proliferate in the presence
of phorbol esters. Whereas CD3 appeared to be involved in transduction
of the signal generated by antigen binding to the T-cell receptor, the
role of the CD2 and CD28 antigens in physiologic proliferation was not
understood. Aruffo and Seed (1987) isolated a cDNA clone encoding CD28
by a simple and highly efficient cloning strategy based on transient
expression. In COS cells the CD28 encodes a highly glycosylated membrane
protein with homology to the immunoglobulin superfamily.

Magistrelli et al. (1999) identified 3 CD28 splice variants in
nonactivated T cells: CD28a, which lacks exon 3, leading to loss of the
transmembrane domain; CD28b, which lacks most of the 3-prime end of exon
2 and exon 3; and CD28c, which lacks exon 2 and exon 3. CD28b and CD28c
were expressed at a low level relative to CD28a. Magistrelli et al.
(1999) suggested that resting T cells may constitutively express both
membrane and soluble CD28, potentially regulating the T-cell response at
different levels.

GENE FUNCTION

Harada et al. (2003) noted that the CD28 cytoplasmic domain contains a
YMNM motif, which binds PI3K (see 601232) and GRB2 (108355), whereas the
corresponding region of ICOS (604558) contains a YMFM motif, which binds
the former but not the latter. Harada et al. (2003) hypothesized that
the reason CD28 signaling, but not ICOS signaling, induces IL2
production is its ability to bind GRB2. To test this hypothesis, they
generated mutant ICOS containing the YMNM motif of CD28. This alteration
allowed ICOS to activate the IL2 promoter, and further analysis showed
that GRB2 binding to ICOS led to activation of the NFAT (see 600490)/AP1
(165160) site in the IL2 promoter. Harada et al. (2003) concluded that
the difference of a single amino acid defines a functional difference
between CD28- and ICOS-mediated costimulatory signals.

By a comprehensive structure-function analysis of the mouse Cd28
cytoplasmic tail, Andres et al. (2004) found that Il2 production and
T-cell proliferation did not require a particular cytoplasmic domain.
However, Il4 (147780) production was driven by cooperative activity of
at least 2 structural motifs, a pro-rich motif at residues 187 to 190
and tyr residues at positions 170 and 188, within the Cd28 cytoplasmic
tail. A gene complementation approach determined that Pdk1 (605213), but
not Itk (186973) or Akt (164730), in an Akt-independent pathway,
mediated a component of the Il4 signal induced by Cd28.

CTLA4 shares 2 ligands, CD80 (112203) and CD86 (601020), with a
stimulatory receptor, CD28. Qureshi et al. (2011) showed that CTLA4 can
capture its ligands from opposing cells by a process of
trans-endocytosis. After removal, these costimulatory ligands are
degraded inside CTLA4-expressing cells, resulting in impaired
costimulation via CD28. Acquisition of CD86 from antigen-presenting
cells is stimulated by T cell receptor engagement and observed in vitro
and in vivo. Qureshi et al. (2011) concluded that their data revealed a
mechanism of immune regulation in which CTLA4 acts as an effector
molecule to inhibit CD28 costimulation by the cell-extrinsic depletion
of ligands, accounting for many of the features of the CD28-CTLA4
system.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1990) found that the CD28 gene is present in single copy and
is organized into 4 exons, each of which defines a functional domain of
the predicted protein. Posttranslational processing appears to result in
variant isotypes of CD28 with potentially different physiologic roles on
the cell surface.

MAPPING

Using in situ hybridization on prometaphase cells, Lafage-Pochitaloff et
al. (1990) demonstrated that the CD28 gene maps to 2q33-q34. The CTLA4
gene (123890) maps to the same region. Both are members of the Ig
superfamily, where they define a subgroup of membrane-bound single V
domains. The chromosomal proximity of CD28 and CTLA4 and their close
structural relationship suggest that these 2 genes resulted from
duplication of a common evolutionary precursor and that they share some
functional properties. By means of intersubspecific crosses, Howard et
al. (1991) mapped the Cd28 gene to the proximal part of mouse chromosome
1. By study of yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC), Buonavista et al.
(1992) demonstrated that the CD28 and CTLA4 genes were in the same
fragment, indicating that they were separated by only 25 to 150 kb. A
CpG island was found between these genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

CD28 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation after interacting with its
ligand, B7 (CD80; 112203). Phosphorylation of tyr173 (tyr170 in mouse)
in the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 allows the recruitment of signaling
proteins such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see PIK3R1; 171833),
GRB2 (108355), and GADS (GRAP2; 604518) via their SH2 domains. Okkenhaug
et al. (2001) reconstituted CD28 knockout mice with transgenes encoding
wildtype Cd28 or Cd28 carrying a tyr170-to-phe mutation. Mutant Cd28 did
not bind to the SH2 domain of PIK3R1, resulting in diminished protein
kinase B (164730) activation. Mutant Cd28 was able to prevent the
induction of anergy, to promote T-cell proliferation and IL2 secretion,
and to provide B-cell help, but was unable to upregulate expression of
the prosurvival protein BCLXL (600039). The defect in BCLXL upregulation
was correlated with increased susceptibility of the T cells to gamma
radiation. Okkenhaug et al. (2001) suggested that other tyrosine
residues or asn172 may be critical to functions not affected by the
tyr170-to-phe mutation.

611501	TITLE *611501 CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 1; CAMTA1
;;KIAA0833
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned CAMTA1, which they designated
KIAA0833. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in adult brain and
in all specific brain regions examined. Little to no expression was
detected in all other tissues examined, including fetal brain.

Nakajima et al. (2002) obtained a full-length CAMTA1 cDNA. The deduced
protein contains 1,734 amino acids.

By searching for genes similar to a plant Camta, Bouche et al. (2002)
identified human CAMTA1 and CAMTA2 (611508). Both deduced proteins
contain an N-terminal DNA-binding CG1 domain, followed by a central
transcription factor immunoglobulin (TIG) domain, 2 ankyrin repeats for
protein-protein interactions, and 4 C-terminal calmodulin
(114180)-binding IQ motifs. The CG1 domain includes a nuclear
localization signal.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1 frequently deleted in
neuroblastomas, Katoh and Katoh (2003) identified CAMTA1. The deduced
protein contains 1,673 amino acids and shares 94.1% identity with mouse
Camta1.

By immunohistochemical analysis of a neuroblastoma cell line, Nakatani
et al. (2004) found that CAMTA1 was cytosolic.

Thevenon et al. (2012) found that embryonic mice had global brain
expression of Camta1 that became restricted to the cerebellum,
hippocampi, and olfactory bulbs later in development. Camta1 was
expressed in the whole brain at embryonic day 15.5. At embryonic day
18.5, staining was marked in the cortical plate and reduced in the
ventricular zone. The olfactory system and the cerebellar anlage were
also positive. At P4, staining was found in the olfactory system, the
superficial layer of the cortical plate, the gyrus dentate of the
hippocampus, and in the vermian external granular layer of the
cerebellum. At P14, staining was restricted to the olfactory system and
the internal granular layer of the cerebellar vermis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2003) determined that the CAMTA1 gene contains 23
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the CAMTA1
gene to chromosome 1. Nakatani et al. (2004) stated that the CAMTA1 gene
maps to chromosome 1p36.

GENE FUNCTION

Bouche et al. (2002) found that CAMTA1 and CAMTA2 activated
transcription of a reporter gene in yeast.

Song et al. (2006) showed that mouse Camta1 and Camta2 activated the Anf
(NPPA; 108780) promoter.

Using RT-PCR, Nakatani et al. (2004) found that expression of CAMTA1 was
highest in S and M phases and lowest in G0/G1 phase in synchronized
neuroblastoma cells. CAMTA2 levels did not change with the cell cycle.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using array CGH, Thevenon et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous
intragenic deletion in the CAMTA1 gene (611501.0001) in affected members
of a large family with early-onset nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia and
mild mental retardation (CANPMR; 614756). Another family with a similar
phenotype had a heterozygous intragenic duplication in the CAMTA1 gene
(611501.0002). Both of these disruptions were predicted to lead to a
frameshift and premature termination. An unrelated child with ataxia but
milder cognitive involvement had a different in-frame deletion within
the gene (611501.0003). All of the rearrangements affected the CG1
domain of the protein. DNA sequencing analysis of the CAMTA1 gene in a
cohort of 197 patients with intellectual disability or nonprogressive
cerebellar ataxia did not identify any point mutations, suggesting that
microrearrangements of the CAMTA1 are the most frequent mutations.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA, NONPROGRESSIVE, WITH MENTAL RETARDATION
CAMTA1, 81-KB DEL, EX4

In affected members of a family with nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia
with mild mental retardation (CANPMR; 614756), Thevenon et al. (2012)
identified a heterozygous 81-kb deletion in the DNA-binding CG1 domain
of the CAMTA1 gene, resulting in the deletion of exon 4, a frameshift,
and premature termination. The deletion was identified using array CGH,
and the effects were confirmed by analysis of mRNA from patient
fibroblasts. In this family, 2 adult half sisters had mild mental
retardation, attended schools for special needs, and worked at simple
jobs. Both had ataxic gait with static instability; 1 had mild intention
tremor. Brain MRI of both women showed mild hippocampal atrophy,
simplified gyration of the dentate gyri, posterior cortical atrophy, and
cerebellar atrophy. PET scan of 1 woman showed hypometabolism of several
cerebral brain regions. One of the women had 2 affected sons, and the
other had 3 affected children. All patients had mental retardation,
usually with delayed psychomotor development, and all had gait
instability or frank ataxia. More variable features included strabismus,
infantile hypotonia, delayed speech, and myoclonic seizures of the upper
arm (1 patient). Some patients had mild dysmorphic facial features. The
mother of the women reportedly had mild intellectual disability.

.0002
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA, NONPROGRESSIVE, WITH MENTAL RETARDATION
CAMTA1, 539-KB DUP, EX3-5

In affected members of a family with nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia
and mild mental retardation (614756), Thevenon et al. (2012) identified
a heterozygous 539-kb duplication in the CG1 domain of the CAMTA1 gene.
RT-PCR analysis of patient fibroblasts showed only normal mRNA; the
quantity of mutant mRNA was lower than the sensitivity of the
experiment. In this family, a mother and her son and daughter were
affected. All had mild intellectual disability, and the mother and
daughter had ataxic gait. The 2 children had delayed psychomotor
development with speech delay. One had neonatal hypotonia and the other
had autistic features, poor interactive skills, and bursts of
aggression. Mild facial dysmorphism was noted.

.0003
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA, NONPROGRESSIVE, WITH MENTAL RETARDATION
CAMTA1, 49-KB DEL, EX2-3

In a girl with nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia with mild mental
retardation (614756), Thevenon et al. (2012) identified a de novo
heterozygous 49-kb deletion in the CG1 domain of the CAMTA1 gene,
resulting in the deletion of exons 2-3, which would not alter the
reading frame. The developmental delay in this child was not as severe
as in those with truncating mutations (see 611501.0001 and 611501.0002).

180465	TITLE *180465 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S25; RPS25
DESCRIPTION The mammalian ribosome is composed of 4 RNA species (see 180450) and
approximately 80 different proteins.

Li et al. (1991) isolated a full-length cDNA clone encoding human
ribosomal protein S25 (RPS25). The cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 125
amino acids with a deduced relative molecular weight of 13,750.

Through generation of sequence tagged sites for chromosome 11, Miwa et
al. (1993) found that 1 cosmid marker contained part of the RPS25 gene.
Imai et al. (1994) further validated its identity and, by direct
fluorescence in situ hybridization, mapped it to 11q23.3. Kenmochi et
al. (1998) confirmed the RPS25 mapping assignment reported by Imai et
al. (1994).

300375	TITLE *300375 CARBOHYDRATE SULFOTRANSFERASE 7; CHST7
;;CHONDROITIN 6-SULFOTRANSFERASE 2; C6ST2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sulfotransferases generate sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) moities
during chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis. They create considerable
structural diversity among chondroitin sulfates by transferring sulfate
with remarkable specificity for the underlying oligosaccharide
substrate. The regulated expression of each member of the
sulfotransferase gene family may be an important determinant of sulfated
GAGs expression and the associated function of chondroitin sulfates as
regulators of many biologic processes.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for members of the sulfotransferase gene
family, followed by 5-prime race using brain cDNA, Kitagawa et al.
(2000) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding CHST7, which they called
C6ST2. Sequence analysis predicted that the 486-amino acid CHST7 protein
has 4 potential N-glycosylation sites and a type II transmembrane
topology characteristic of many Golgi-localized sulfotransferases. CHST7
shares 24% and 40% amino acid identity with C6ST1 (CHST3; 603799) and
CHST2 (603798), respectively. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.4-kb
CHST7 transcript in all brain tissues tested. RT-PCR analysis showed
CHST7 expression in most fetal and adult tissues tested; a notable
exception was adult skin. In fetal tissues, expression was most abundant
in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and spleen, while in adult tissues,
expression was most abundant in spleen. The authors noted that the CHST7
expression pattern was distinct from that of CHST3.

GENE FUNCTION

Kitagawa et al. (2000) expressed a soluble recombinant form of CHST7 in
COS-1 cells and produced an active sulfotransferase with marked
specificity for polymer chondroitin. The authors found that CHST7 and
CHST3 have distinct but overlapping acceptor substrate specificities,
with CHST7 having a more strict specificity for polymer chondroitin.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Kitagawa et al. (2000) determined that the
CHST7 gene has 2 exons and spans more than 24 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kitagawa et al. (2000) mapped the CHST7
gene to chromosome Xp11.

172470	TITLE *172470 PHOSPHORYLASE KINASE, MUSCLE, GAMMA-1; PHKG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphorylase kinase (EC 2.7.1.38) is a crucial glycogenolytic
regulatory enzyme. The holoenzymes are composed of 16 subunit proteins
containing equimolar ratios of 4 subunit types known as alpha, beta,
gamma, and delta. Skeletal muscle contains the highest amount of
phosphorylase kinase enzymatic activity, although activity is also
observed in liver, cardiac muscle, brain, and several other tissues.
Kinetic differences exist between the cardiac and adult skeletal muscle
enzymes, and the liver and skeletal muscle enzymes are known to be
separate isozymes.

CLONING

Chamberlain et al. (1987) isolated a mouse cDNA probe for the gamma
subunit of phosphorylase kinase of muscle. RNA gel blot analysis showed
that the muscle gamma-phosphorylase kinase probe hybridized to mRNA in
skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain, but did not hybridize to
liver RNA.

Using a murine muscle phosphorylase kinase-gamma cDNA fragment to screen
a human muscle cDNA library, Wehner and Kilimann (1995) isolated the
human PHKG1 cDNA. The 387-amino acid protein shows 93 to 94% identity
with rabbit, mouse, and rat Phkg1 sequences. Northern blot analysis
revealed an approximately 3.0-kb transcript.

MAPPING

Chamberlain et al. (1987) demonstrated that the gamma subunit of
phosphorylase kinase maps to human chromosome 7, with a single band
hybridizing to chromosome 11.

Jones et al. (1990) used a rabbit skeletal muscle cDNA for the gamma
subunit of phosphorylase kinase to map the human gene to 7p12-q21
through analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization. They
interpreted the data as indicating that the gene is located just above
the centromere of chromosome 7, with further cross-hybridizing sequences
at 7q21 and 11p14-p11. The liver gamma subunit is distinct and its mRNA
did not cross-hybridize with the skeletal muscle gamma subunit cDNA. The
results indicated that the autosomal human phosphorylasse kinase
deficiency of both liver and mascle (261750) is caused by a defect in
the autosomally determined beta subunit (172490) rather than in the
gamma subunit.

Burwinkel et al. (2003) identified 2 PHKG1 pseudogene sequences on
chromosome 7q11.1 and 1 on chromosome 11p11.1-q11, which they designated
PHKG1P1-3, respectively.

Maichele and Chamberlain (1994) mapped the mouse Phkg1 gene to
chromosome 5 near the locus for beta-glucuronidase (611499).

GENE STRUCTURE

Burwinkel et al. (2003) determined that the PHKG1 gene contains 10 exons
spanning approximately 12 kb. Exon 1 is noncoding.

609870	TITLE *609870 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 21; ARHGAP21
;;GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RHO, 21;;
KIAA1424;;
RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 10, FORMERLY; ARHGAP10, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ARHGAP21 functions preferentially as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP)
for CDC42 (116952) and regulates the ARP2/3 complex (604221) and F-actin
dynamics at the Golgi through control of CDC42 activity (Dubois et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By screening an adult brain cDNA library for cDNAs likely to encode
large proteins, Nagase et al. (2000) isolated a partial cDNA encoding
ARHGAP21, which they called KIAA1424. RT-PCR ELISA detected wide
expression of KIAA1424, with highest expression in brain and spinal
cord. Within brain, highest expression was in corpus callosum and
hippocampus, followed by amygdala, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, and
substantia nigra.

By searching databases for potential cytoskeletal proteins, followed by
PCR of a brain cDNA library and RACE, Basseres et al. (2002) obtained a
full-length cDNA encoding ARHGAP21, which they termed ARHGAP10. The
predicted 1,957-amino acid protein contains a pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain, a RHOGAP domain, and a PDZ domain with a glycine-rich
nucleotide-binding P loop. Northern blot analysis revealed wide
expression of a 7.5-kb transcript, with highest expression in brain,
heart, skeletal muscle, and placenta. Expression was variable in several
cancer cell lines.

Using immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses, Dubois et al. (2005)
found that ARHGAP21 was expressed as a juxtanuclear Golgi complex
protein of more than 250 kD. Its association with the Golgi complex was
reminiscent of ARF1 (103180) distribution.

GENE FUNCTION

Using real-time RT-PCR analysis, Basseres et al. (2002) showed that
hemopoietic stem cells stimulated towards myeloid or erythroid
differentiation had a marked increase in ARHGAP21 expression. They
concluded that ARHGAP21 is a cytoskeletal RHOGAP protein involved in
cell differentiation.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Dubois et al. (2005) isolated ARHGAP21
via its interaction with activated mutants of ARF6 (600464) and ARF1.
GST pull-down and mutation analyses showed that the interactions
occurred through the PH domain of ARHGAP21. RHOGAP assays indicated that
ARHGAP21 acted preferentially on CDC42 over RHOA (ARHA; 165390) and RAC1
(602048). Small interfering (siRNA) treatment of ARHGAP21 led to
constitutive activation of CDC42 that resulted in actin cytoskeleton
remodeling, suggesting that ARHGAP21 is required for Golgi complex
organization. Loss of ARHGAP21 also caused a massive
activation/recruitment of the ARP2/3 complex in the juxtanuclear region.
Dubois et al. (2005) concluded that ARHGAP21 is a downstream partner of
ARF1 that regulates Golgi structure and function through control of
CDC42 activity.

Alpha-catenin (CTNNA1; 116805) is recruited by beta-catenin (CTNNB1;
116806) after interaction of CTNNB1 with the cytoplasmic domain of
E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090), a receptor for the Listeria monocytogenes
InlA protein. By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Sousa et al. (2005) identified
ARHGAP21 as a CTNNA1-interacting partner. ARHGAP21 and CTNNA1
colocalized at cell-cell junctions, and ARHGAP21 was recruited to L.
monocytogenes entry sites. Knockdown of ARHGAP21 impaired both L.
monocytogenes entry and CTNNA1 recruitment at cell-cell contacts. In
contrast, overexpression of ARHGAP21 enhanced CTNNA1 levels at cell-cell
junctions and inhibited entry of the bacterium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Basseres et al. (2002) determined that the ARHGAP21 gene contains 25
exons and spans at least 88 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Basseres et al. (2002) mapped the ARHGAP21
gene to chromosome 10p12.32. They identified an intronless copy on
chromosome 6 that may represent a retropseudogene.

609134	TITLE *609134 UBIQUITIN-PROTEIN LIGASE E3 COMPONENT N-RECOGNIN 2; UBR2
;;CHROMOSOME 6 OPEN READING FRAME 133; C6ORF133;;
KIAA0349
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system controls the
concentration of many regulatory proteins. The selectivity of
ubiquitylation is determined by ubiquitin E3 ligases, which recognize
the substrate's destabilization signal, or degron. The E3 ligase UBR2
participates in the N-end rule pathway, which targets proteins bearing
an N-terminal degron, or N-degron (Kwon et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned UBR2, which they designated
KIAA0349. The deduced 1,275-amino acid protein shares 19.9% identity
over 710 amino acids with an S. cerevisiae N-end-recognizing protein.
RT-PCR of several tissues detected UBR2 expression only in testis.

Kwon et al. (2003) cloned mouse Ubr2. The deduced protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 200 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Kwon et al. (2003) determined that mouse Ubr2 bound to type-1 (arg) and
type-2 (leu or phe) destabilizing N-terminal residues of a test
substrate or a 12-residue peptide. It did not bind to stabilizing (met
or gly), secondary destabilizing (asp), or type-3 destabilizing (ser,
thr, or ala) residues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kwon et al. (2003) determined that the mouse Ubr2 gene contains 48 exons
and spans about 98 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the UBR2 gene
to chromosome 6. Using radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Kwon et al.
(2003) mapped the UBR2 gene to chromosome 6p21-p11 and the mouse Ubr2
gene to the middle of chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kwon et al. (2003) found that Ubr2 knockout in mice was embryonic lethal
depending on both the gender and genetic background. In an inbred
strain, the Ubr2 -/- genotype was lethal to most embryos of either
gender. In a mixed background, most Ubr2 -/- females died as embryos and
Ubr2 -/- males were viable but infertile due to postnatal degeneration
of the testes. The gross architecture of Ubr2 -/- testes was normal and
spermatogonia were intact, but spermatocytes were arrested between
leptotene/zygotene and pachytene, and died through apoptosis. A
conspicuous defect of Ubr2 -/- spermatocytes was the absence of intact
synaptonemal complexes. Ubr2 +/- heterozygotes were produced at
approximately mendelian frequency and were phenotypically normal except
for reduced fertility compared with wildtype mice.

;;SEC14, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 2;;
TOCOPHEROL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; TAP1;;
TAP KIAA1186
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned a partial cDNA encoding SEC14L2,
which they designated KIAA1186. RT-PCR followed by ELISA detected
moderate expression in kidney, spleen, testis, ovary, and fetal liver.
Lower levels were detected in whole brain, lung, and adult liver.

Zimmer et al. (2000) sequenced peptide fragments from bovine SEC14L2,
which they called TAP, and searched a database using these sequences to
identify human TAP. Using RT-PCR they cloned full-length TAP from human
small intestine total RNA. The deduced 403-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 46 kD and contains a conserved
hydrophobic lipid-binding pocket called the CRAL (cis-retinal
binding)/TRIO (triple function) domain. Human and bovine TAP share about
84% amino acid identity. mRNA dot blot analysis detected broad tissue
distribution, with highest expression in liver, prostate, and brain.
Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of 2.8 kb and 2 minor
transcripts of approximately 4.2 and 2.8 kb expressed at highest levels
in liver and brain and more weakly in kidney.

By immunocytochemical studies, Kempna et al. (2003) showed that SEC14L2
localized to intracellular membranes of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells,
including partial localization to the ER and Golgi, with more intense
staining surrounding but not within the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a biotinylated alpha-tocopherol derivative, Zimmer et al. (2000)
demonstrated that recombinant TAP binds alpha-tocopherol at physiologic
concentrations. Binding was dose dependent and saturable.

By ligand competition analysis, Yamauchi et al. (2001) confirmed
specific interaction between recombinant TAP and alpha-tocopherol. TAP
did not significantly interact with any other tocopherols or
tocotrienols examined. Alpha-tocopherol induced the translocation of TAP
from the cytosol to the nucleus of transfected COS-7 cells. Transient
transfection experiments showed that TAP activated transcription of a
reporter gene in an alpha-tocopherol-dependent manner. Yamauchi et al.
(2001) hypothesized that alpha-tocopherol is not only an antioxidant,
but also a transcriptional regulator via its association with TAP.

Kempna et al. (2003) showed that in HeLa cells deletion of the
C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain reduced SEC14L2 localization in
the region surrounding the nucleus with some tubular sacs emerging. They
suggested that the SEC14L2 GOLD domain may play a role in docking to
other proteins or in intracellular transport of bound ligands. Using
several assays, Kempna et al. (2003) demonstrated that SEC14L2 bound
tocopherol, squalene, and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine,
phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol). Although SEC14L2 bound
phospholipids, it failed to complement an S. cerevisiae
temperature-sensitive Sec14 allele in yeast. Using immunoprecipitation
assays, Kempna et al. (2003) showed that SEC14L2 may interact with and
regulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, and SEC14L2 displayed
low basal GTPase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zimmer et al. (2000) determined that the SEC14L2 gene contains 12 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hirosawa et al. (1999) mapped the SEC14L2
gene to chromosome 22. By genomic sequence analysis, Zimmer et al.
(2000) mapped the SEC14L2 gene to chromosome 22q12.1-qter.

SUPERFICIAL ZONE PROTEIN; SZP
HEMANGIOPOIETIN, INCLUDED; HAPO, INCLUDED;;
LUBRICIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Merberg et al. (1993) first detected megakaryocyte-stimulating factor
(MSF) in the urine of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation
during a period of acute thrombocytopenia. Subsequent cloning studies
demonstrated that this 20- to 25-kD urinary metabolite of MSF was an
N-terminal cysteine-rich polypeptide component derived from a larger,
highly glycosylated precursor protein of approximately 400 kD. The
smaller urinary metabolite was shown to stimulate growth in both pure
and mixed megakaryocyte colonies from bone marrow fibrin cultures. MSF
precursor is a multifunctional domain protein with polypeptide sequence
homologies to both serum adhesive glycoproteins and secretory mucins
(see 158370). Articular cartilage MSF precursor contains large (76 to 78
repeats) and small (6 to 8 repeats) mucin-like O-ringed
oligosaccharide-rich repeat domains flanked by cysteine-rich N- and
C-terminal domains that are homologous to the somatomedin B and
hemopexin domains of vitronectin (193190), respectively.

Schumacher et al.(1994) described superficial zone protein (SZP), an
approximately 345-kD proteoglycan specifically synthesized by
chondrocytes located at the surface of bovine articular cartilage, and
also by some synovial lining cells. They demonstrated that SZP is
secreted by superficial zone chondrocytes and not by chondrocytes from
other zones of articular cartilage. SZP contains both chondroitin
sulfate and keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. SZP is extensively
degraded by papain, trypsin (276000), and pronase, but limited pepsin
(see 169700) treatment decreases its molecular mass only to 315 kD. SZP
is predominantly found in the media of explant and cell cultures.

Flannery et al. (1999) used cDNA sequencing and homology analysis to
elucidate the complete amino acid composition for the superficial zone
protein from human and bovine cartilage. They established that human
cartilage SZP is homologous with the proteoglycan first described as the
precursor protein of a megakaryocyte-stimulating factor by Merberg et
al. (1993). The cDNA encodes a protein of 1,404 amino acids with a
somatomedin B homology domain, heparin-binding domains, multiple
mucin-like repeats, a hemopexin domain, and an aggregation domain. There
are 3 consensus sequences for N-glycosylation and 1 chondroitin sulfate
substitution site. Bovine SZP and human MSF precursor sequences are
about 75% identical at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels.

Using a positional cloning approach, Marcelino et al. (1999) identified
the MSF gene within the chromosome 1q25-q31 critical region for the
autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis
syndrome (CACP; 208250) locus. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that
a 4.5-kb MSF mRNA is expressed in several tissues, including liver,
lung, and heart, and is highly expressed in synovial tissue. A 30-kD
N-terminal MSF fragment was detectable in serum and urine.

By Northern blot analysis, Ikegawa et al. (2000) demonstrated limited
expression of the human PRG4 gene as 4.2- and 1.7-kb transcripts;
expression was strongest in liver, but was also observed in heart,
brain, and muscle. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated strong expression in
cartilage. RT-PCR also detected 4 types of alternative splicing. Type A
consisted of exons 1-6, type B of exons 1 and 3-5, type C of exons 1-3,
and type D of exons 1 and 3. Resultant deletions caused by skipping
these exons were all in-frame. Types A and B were expressed
ubiquitously; types C and D showed tissue-limited expression.

The cells of hematopoietic and vascular endothelial cell lineages are
believed to share a common precursor, termed the hemangioblast. Liu et
al. (2004) reported the identification of hemangiopoietin (HAPO), a
novel growth factor acting on both hematopoietic and endothelial cell
lineages. The cDNA clone encoding HAPO is an alternative splicing
variant lacking exon 5 of PRG4, as demonstrated by a comparative cDNA
sequence analysis of HAPO and PRG4. Liu et al. (2004) suggested that
HAPO may have a clinical potential in the treatment of various
cytopenias and radiation injury and in the expansion of hematopoietic
and endothelial stem/progenitor cells.

Jay et al. (2000) purified lubricin from pooled synovial fluid with
normal lubricating activity that was obtained from patients with
osteoarthritis. Purified lubricin has an apparent molecular mass of 280
kD by SDS-PAGE; deglycosylation decreased the apparent molecular mass to
120 kD. Sequencing revealed a 100% match with exons 6 to 9 of the MSF
gene. Lubricin exhibited boundary-lubricating activity similar to that
of whole synovial fluid. Jay et al. (2000) concluded that lubricin is
secreted by synovial fibroblasts. They stated that lubricin is the only
lubricating component in the final lubricating fraction of human
synovial fluid.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ikegawa et al. (2000) determined that the human and mouse PRG4 genes
each contain 12 exons and that they span 18 and 16 kb, respectively.

MAPPING

Using a positional cloning approach, Marcelino et al. (1999) identified
the MSF gene within the chromosome 1q25-q31 critical region for the
autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis
syndrome (CACP; 208250) locus.

By FISH, Ikegawa et al. (2000) mapped the human PRG4 gene to chromosome
1q24-q25. By the same method they mapped the mouse mouse Prg4 gene to
chromosome 1G, in a region showing syntenic homology to human 1q24-q25.

GENE FUNCTION

Jay et al. (2007) used a multiple-particle-tracking microrheology
technique to study the molecular interaction between lubricin and
hyaluronic acid in bovine synovial fluid. They found that lubricin
affects the diffusive behavior of synovial fluid and contributes to the
elastic absorption and energy dissipation of synovial fluid at
physiologic shear frequencies. In studies involving synovial fluid from
a patient with camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis,
hyaluronic acid molecules adopted an extended and more rigid
conformation, suggesting that synovial fluid lacking lubricin would be
less able to dissipate the energy of impact that occurs during mammalian
locomotion. Jay et al. (2007) concluded that lubricin provides a
chondroprotective feature to synovial fluid that is distinct from the
role lubricin plays at the cartilage surface as a boundary lubricant.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Marcelino et al. (1999) identified 8 likely disease-causing mutations in
the MSF gene in patients with CACP from consanguineous families. Four
were homozygous deletions. Additionally, they detected a dinucleotide
transversion that created a nonsense codon, and a 41-bp insertion 14
nucleotides upstream of the intron 6 splice acceptor site that disrupted
the polypyrimidine tract of the splice site. Each of these mutations was
predicted to result in a truncated protein. Due to its high
glycosylation content and mucin-like repeats, Marcelino et al. (1999)
suggested that MSF may act as a joint/intimal cell lubricant. Both
synovial and pericardial cell hyperplasia may represent secondary
consequences of insufficient cell surface lubrication. Alternatively,
cell overgrowth may be primary to the pathogenesis of CACP.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rhee et al. (2005) generated Prg4 -/- mice, in which joints appeared
normal at birth; with aging there were abnormal protein deposits on the
cartilage surface, disappearance of underlying superficial zone
chondrocytes, and hyperplasia of intimal cells in the synovium. Purified
or recombinant lubricin inhibited the growth of those synoviocytes in
vitro. Tendon and tendon sheath involvement was present in the ankle
joints, with morphologic changes and abnormal calcification. Rhee et al.
(2005) concluded that lubricin has multiple functions in articulating
joints and tendons that include the protection of surfaces and control
of synovial cell growth.

610034	TITLE *610034 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 33, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, A; VPS33A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By PCR of a pancreas cDNA library, Pevsner et al. (1996) obtained a
partial cDNA of human VPS33A. They cloned full-length rat Vps33a, which
encodes a deduced 597-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis
detected several Vps33a transcripts in all rat tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

- Role of VPS33A in Ebola Virus Infection

Infections by the Ebola and Marburg filoviruses cause a rapidly fatal
hemorrhagic fever in humans for which no approved antivirals are
available. Filovirus entry is mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein
(GP), which attaches viral particles to the cell surface, delivers them
to endosomes, and catalyzes fusion between viral and endosomal
membranes. Additional host factors in the endosomal compartment are
likely required for viral membrane fusion. Using a replication-competent
vesicular stomatitis virus bearing Ebola virus GP (rVSV-GP-EboV) for a
genomewide haploid genetic screen in human cells, followed by selection
of rVSV-GP-EboV-resistant cells, Carette et al. (2011) confirmed a role
for cathepsin B (CTSB; 116810) and identified roles for NPC1 (607623)
and all 6 subunits of the HOPS complex, VPS11 (608549), VPS16 (608550),
VPS18 (608551), VPS33A, VPS39 (612188), and VPS41 (605485), in Ebola
virus entry. Subcloned cells lacking VPS11, VPS33A, or NPC1 displayed
marked resistance to rVSV-GP-EboV or Marburg virus-GP, and
susceptibility could be restored by expression of the corresponding
cDNAs. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that cells lacking
NPC1, VPS11, or VPS33A had an altered distribution of virus within
cells. Carette et al. (2011) concluded that most of the genes involved
in filovirus entry are involved in lysosome function, indicating that
filoviruses exploit this organelle differently than other viruses.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VPS33A
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH44549).

602738	TITLE *602738 KARYOPHERIN BETA-1; KPNB1
;;IMPORTIN BETA-1
DESCRIPTION The import of proteins into the nucleus proceeds through the nuclear
pore complex. Cytoplasmic proteins with a nuclear localization signal
(NLS) bind to an importin-alpha (see 600685)/importin-beta heterodimer.
The trimeric complex docks to the cytoplasmic periphery of the nuclear
pore complex and is subsequently translocated through as a single
entity. The import reaction is terminated by the direct binding of RAN
(601179) to KPNB, which dissociates the importin heterodimer.

CLONING

Gorlich et al. (1995) purified a 90-kD subunit of importin (importin-90)
from Xenopus egg extracts and obtained a 188-amino acid partial protein
sequence from internal peptides. Using the partial amino acid sequence,
they isolated cDNAs encoding human importin-90, or KPNB1, from a HeLa
cell cDNA library. The sequence of the predicted 876-amino acid human
KPNB1 protein is 93% identical to the 188-amino acid partial sequence of
Xenopus importin-90. Gorlich et al. (1995) showed that Xenopus
importin-60 and importin-90 cooperate to form an import receptor that
distinguishes functional NLSs from nonfunctional ones and selectively
binds import substrates to the nuclear envelope. Independently, Chi et
al. (1995) identified cDNAs encoding human KPNB1. Based on the 97-kD
product of in vitro translation, they designated the protein p97. Using
a monoclonal antibody against bovine p97, Chi et al. (1995) localized
p97 to the cytoplasm and nuclear envelope of bovine kidney cells. These
authors found that recombinant human p97 binds zinc and that a bound
metal ion is required for nuclear envelope-binding activity. Kutay et
al. (1997) identified the regions of KPNB1 that interact with RAN,
importin-alpha, and the nuclear pore complex.

GENE FUNCTION

The guanosine triphosphatase Ran (601179) stimulates assembly of
microtubule asters and spindles in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts. A
carboxy-terminal region of the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NUMA;
164009), a nuclear protein required for organizing mitotic spindle
poles, mimics Ran's ability to induce asters. This NUMA fragment also
specifically interacted with importin-beta. Wiese et al. (2001) showed
that importin-beta is an inhibitor of microtubule aster assembly in
Xenopus egg extracts and that Ran regulates the interaction between
importin-beta and NUMA. Importin-beta therefore links NUMA to regulation
by Ran. Wiese et al. (2001) concluded that this suggests that similar
mechanisms regulate nuclear import during interphase and spindle
assembly during mitosis.

The survival of motor neuron (SMN1; 600354) protein is mutated in
patients with spinal muscular atrophy. SMN is part of a multiprotein
complex required for biogenesis of the Sm class of small nuclear
ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Following assembly of the Sm core domain,
snRNPs are transported to the nucleus via importin-beta. Sm snRNPs
contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of a
2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap and the Sm core. Snurportin-1
(607902) is the adaptor protein that recognizes both the TMG cap and
importin-beta. Narayanan et al. (2002) reported that a mutant snurportin
construct lacking the importin-beta-binding (IBB) domain, but containing
an intact TMG cap-binding domain, localized primarily to the nucleus,
whereas full-length snurportin localized to the cytoplasm. Snurportin
interacted with SMN, Gemin3 (606168), Sm snRNPs, and importin-beta. In
the presence of ribonucleases, the interactions with SMN and Sm proteins
were abolished, suggesting that snRNAs may mediate this interplay. Cell
fractionation studies showed that snurportin bound preferentially to
cytoplasmic SMN complexes. Additionally, SMN directly interacted with
importin-beta in a GST-pull-down assay, suggesting that the SMN complex
may represent the Sm core NLS receptor predicted by previous studies.
The authors concluded that, following Sm protein assembly, the SMN
complex may persist until the final stages of cytoplasmic snRNP
maturation, and may provide somatic cell RNPs with an alternative NLS.

Using a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs), Kittler et al. (2004) identified 37 genes required for cell
division, one of which was KPNB1. These 37 genes included several
splicing factors for which knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects.
In addition, a putative nuclear-export terminator was found to speed up
cell proliferation and mitotic progression after knockdown.

Caudron et al. (2005) reported that the spatial cues necessary for
microtubules to reproducibly self-organize during cell division are
provided by chromosome-mediated interaction gradients between the small
guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ran and importin-beta. This produces
activity gradients that determine the spatial distribution of
microtubule nucleation and stabilization around chromosomes and that are
essential for the self-organization of microtubules into a bipolar
spindle.

Kalab et al. (2006) examined the Ran-importin-beta system in cells by
conventional and fluorescence lifetime microscopy using a biosensor,
termed Rango, that increases its fluorescence resonance energy transfer
signal when released from importin-beta by RanGTP. Rango is
predominantly free in mitotic cells, but is further liberated around
mitotic chromatin. In vitro experiments and modeling showed that this
localized increase of free cargoes corresponds to changes in RanGTP
concentration sufficient to stabilize microtubules in extracts. In
cells, the Ran-importin-beta-cargo gradient kinetically promotes spindle
formation but is largely dispensable once the spindle has been
established. Kalab et al. (2006) observed that the Ran system also
affects spindle pole formation and chromosome congression in vivo. Kalab
et al. (2006) concluded that conserved Ran-regulated pathways are
involved in multiple, parallel processes required for spindle function,
but that their relative contribution differs in chromatin- versus
centrosome/kinetochore-driven spindle assembly systems.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bayliss et al. (2000) described the crystal structure of a complex
between KPNB1 residues 1 to 442 and 5 tandem FxFG nucleoporin repeats
from yeast Nsp1.

Lee et al. (2003) showed the crystal structure of importin-beta
complexed with the active form of SREBP2 (600481). Importin-beta uses
characteristic long helices like a pair of chopsticks to interact with
an SREBP2 dimer. Importin-beta changes its conformation to reveal a
pseudo-2-fold symmetry on its surface structure so that it can
accommodate a symmetric dimer molecule.

To provide a basis for understanding the crucial cargo-release step of
nuclear import, Lee et al. (2005) presented the crystal structure of
full-length yeast importin-beta (Kap95) complexed with RanGTP (see
602362). Lee et al. (2005) identified a key interaction site where the
RanGTP switch I loop binds to the carboxy-terminal arch of Kap95. This
interaction produced a change in helicoidal pitch that locks Kap95 in a
conformation that cannot bind importin-alpha (see 600685) or cargo. Lee
et al. (2005) suggested an allosteric mechanism for nuclear import
complex disassembly by RanGTP.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ayala-Madrigal et al. (2000)
mapped the KPNB1 gene to chromosome 17q21. By FISH, Matsuda et al.
(1996) mapped the mouse Kpnb1 gene to the proximal end of chromosome
11D.

610097	TITLE *610097 OUTER DENSE FIBER OF SPERM TAILS 4; ODF4
;;OPPO1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nakamura et al. (2002) cloned mouse Oppo1 (Odf4), which encodes a
protein localized to the outer dense fibers of the mature sperm tail.
Using a human EST with sequence homology to mouse Odf4, Kitamura et al.
(2003) isolated human ODF4 cDNA from a testis cDNA library and ODF4
genomic clones from whole blood. The deduced 257-amino acid ODF4 protein
shares 39.9% identity with the mouse protein. By RT-PCR analysis,
Kitamura et al. (2003) detected a 768-bp transcript expressed
exclusively in testis and, by Western analysis, a 30-kD ODF4 protein in
testis and sperm. Immunofluorescence staining of ejaculated sperm
localized ODF4 to a restricted region from the neck to the middle and
principal pieces of sperm flagellae.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kitamura et al. (2003) determined that the ODF4 gene contains 3 exons
and differs from the 5-exon structure of the mouse gene; most notably,
ODF4 exon 1 extends over mouse exons 1 and 2, and the ODF4 gene lacks an
exon corresponding to exon 3 of the mouse gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kitamura et al. (2003) identified the ODF4
gene on chromosome 17 and the mouse homolog in a region of syntenic
homology on chromosome 11.

137780	TITLE *137780 GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; GFAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Glial fibrillary acidic protein is an intermediate-filament (IF) protein
that is highly specific for cells of astroglial lineage. Reeves et al.
(1989) isolated a cDNA encoding GFAP and determined its nucleotide
sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence indicated that GFAP shares
structural similarities--particularly in the central rod domain and to a
lesser degree in the carboxyl-terminal domain--with other IF proteins
found in nonepithelial cell types. Considerable sequence divergence in
the amino-terminal region of GFAP suggested that the tissue-specific
functions of this IF protein may be mediated through this region of the
molecule. GFAP is a useful marker of astroglia in the brain.

Using PS1 (104311) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Nielsen et al.
(2002) cloned a splice variant of GFAP, which they called GFAP-epsilon,
from a fetal brain cDNA library. GFAP-epsilon contains 42 amino acids
encoded by exon 7a at its C terminus in place of the 43-amino acid C
terminus encoded by exons 8 and 9 of GFAP-alpha, the originally
identified GFAP transcript.

MAPPING

Bernier et al. (1988) used cDNA probes to determine the chromosomal
location of the GFAP gene in the mouse by following its segregation in a
panel of interspecies somatic cell hybrids. Furthermore, they defined
RFLPs associated with the gene. Patterns of inheritance of these RFLPs
in recombinant inbred strains of mice showed that GFAP is encoded by a
single genetic locus on mouse chromosome 11. The murine gene is in close
proximity to the genes encoding p53 and myeloperoxidase. By Southern
blot hybridization of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization,
Bongcam-Rudloff et al. (1991) mapped the GFAP gene to human 17q21.
Brownell et al. (1991) also assigned the GFAP gene to chromosome 17 by
screening a mouse/human somatic cell hybrid panel with a GFAP cDNA
fragment.

GENE FUNCTION

Using binding assays with recombinant proteins, Nielsen et al. (2002)
determined that the unique C terminus of the GFAP-epsilon splice variant
was required for interaction with PS1, as were the coiled-coil 2 and
linker 1-2 regions shared with GFAP-alpha. GFAP-alpha did not interact
with PS1. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis of point mutations introduced into PS1
indicated that 2 nonconservative amino acid substitutions abolished
interaction with GFAP-epsilon, but 2 conservative substitutions, both
associated with Alzheimer disease, did not effect GFAP-epsilon binding.
By transfection in human embryonic kidney cells and in mouse
neuroblastoma cells, Nielsen et al. (2002)found that GFAP-epsilon
associated with intermediate filaments and perfectly colocalized with
GFAP-alpha, suggesting that both isoforms are polymerized into the same
filamentous structures. A subpopulation of GFAP-epsilon also colocalized
with PS1 in the perinuclear region and in cytoplasmic granules.

Radomska et al. (2013) stated that 3 major GFAP splice variants,
GFAP-alpha, -delta, and -kappa, are present in human central nervous
system. They found that GFAP-alpha was the dominant GFAP variant in
primary cultured human astrocytes. Knockdown of the RNA-binding protein
QKI (609590), predominantly the QKI7 variant, reduced astrocyte content
of GFAP-alpha mRNA. Treatment of astrocytes with the antipsychotic drug
haloperidol increased the expression of both QKI7 and GFAP-alpha.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Alexander disease (203450) is a rare disorder of the central nervous
system. Infants with Alexander disease develop a leukoencephalopathy
with macrocephaly, seizures, and psychomotor retardation, leading to
death usually within the first decade; patients with juvenile or adult
forms typically experience ataxia, bulbar signs and spasticity, and a
more slowly progressive course. The pathologic hallmark of all forms of
Alexander disease is the presence of Rosenthal fibers, cytoplasmic
inclusions in astrocytes that contain the intermediate filament protein
GFAP in association with small heat-shock proteins. By sequence analysis
of DNA from patients representing different Alexander disease
phenotypes, Brenner et al. (2001) found that most cases were associated
with nonconservative mutations in the coding region of the GFAP gene.
Alexander disease, therefore, represents the first example of a primary
genetic disorder of astrocytes, one of the major cell types in the
vertebrate CNS. Each mutation identified in the GFAP gene was
heterozygous, suggesting a dominant mutation. Because parental DNA was
normal in all instances where it was available, the authors concluded
that most cases of Alexander disease result from de novo mutations. It
was noteworthy that mutations in only 4 codons accounted for Alexander
disease in 10 of 11 patients, and these were all arginine codons.
Arginine codons are recognized as particularly prone to mutation,
presumably due to methylation of the CpG dinucleotide. Brenner et al.
(2001) suggested that the GFAP mutations in Alexander disease most
likely act in a dominant gain-of-function manner, as the phenotype of
Gfap-null mice is subtle and does not resemble Alexander disease. They
pointed out that the results do not exclude the possibility that defects
in other genes may be responsible for some cases of Alexander disease.
For example, Schuelke et al. (1999) reported a child with a phenotype
resembling Alexander disease (but without pathologic confirmation) who
was homozygous for a mutation in the NDUFV1 gene (161015.0003).

Rodriguez et al. (2001) searched for GFAP mutations in a series of
patients who had heterogeneous clinical symptoms but were candidates for
Alexander disease on the basis of suggestive neuroimaging abnormalities.
De novo heterozygous missense GFAP mutations were found in exon 1 or
exon 4 in 14 of the 15 patients analyzed, including patients without
macrocephaly. Nine patients carried arginine mutations that had been
described elsewhere: 4 had arg239 to cys (137780.0001); 1 had arg239 to
his (137780.0002); and 1 had arg79 to his (137780.0004). The other 5
patients had 1 of 4 novel mutations, of which 2 affected arginine and 2
affected nonarginine residues. All mutations were located in the rod
domain of GFAP, and there was a correlation between clinical severity
and the affected amino acid.

Li et al. (2005) identified mutations in the GFAP gene in 41 patients
with Alexander disease. They stated that a total of 42 different GFAP
mutations had been identified, and almost all mutations resulted in a
gain-of-function dominant effect. There was a suggestion of male
predominance of the disorder.

Li et al. (2006) determined that the paternal chromosome carried the
GFAP mutation in 24 of 28 unrelated cases of Alexander disease analyzed,
suggesting that most mutations occur during spermatogenesis rather than
in the embryo. No effect of paternal age was observed.

In 13 unrelated Italian patients with Alexander disease, including 8
with the infantile, 2 with the juvenile, and 3 with the adult form,
Caroli et al. (2007) identified 11 different mutations in the GFAP gene
(see, e.g., 137780.0005), including 4 novel mutations. Ten mutations
occurred in the rod domains and 1 in the tail domain.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Rodriguez et al. (2001) could discern a genotype-phenotype correlation
for the 2 most frequently mutated arginine residues, R79 (8 patients)
and R239 (10 patients), with the phenotype of the R79 mutations
appearing much less severe than that of the R239 mutations. The 4
patients they found with R79 mutations appeared to be the least severely
affected: none developed macrocephaly, 3 achieved independent walking,
and, at the time of report, all were alive at ages 2.5 to 20 years.
Similarly, among the 4 patients with R79 mutations who were reported by
Brenner et al. (2001), 2 lived until the ages of 14 and 48 years, the
other 2 were still alive, at ages 7 and 8 years, at the time of report
by Rodriguez et al. (2001). Patients with R239 mutations, reported by
both Brenner et al. (2001) and Rodriguez et al. (2001), had marked
impairment of psychomotor development, and some had progressive
macrocephaly.

Gorospe et al. (2002) reported 12 genetically confirmed cases of
Alexander disease caused by 9 heterozygous point mutations in the GFAP
gene. The cases demonstrated variable ages of onset and symptoms. The
authors stated that no clear-cut genotype-phenotype correlations were
apparent.

ANIMAL MODEL

Messing et al. (1998) found that overexpression of human GFAP in
astrocytes of transgenic mice was fatal and was accompanied by the
presence of inclusion bodies indistinguishable from human Rosenthal
fibers, the pathologic hallmark of all forms of Alexander disease. These
results suggested that a primary alteration in the GFAP gene may be
responsible for Alexander disease.

Gomi et al. (1995), Pekny et al. (1995), Shibuki et al. (1996), and
Liedtke et al. (1996) independently reported generation of
GFAP-deficient mice. In all cases, the mutant mice are normal at birth
and develop grossly normal. Using immunohistochemical analysis, Pekny et
al. (1995) concluded that GFAP knockout mice are lacking intermediate
filaments in astrocytes of the hippocampus and in the white matter of
the spinal cord. Using microscopic analysis of brain sections, Liedtke
et al. (1996) observed a mutant phenotype characterized by abnormal
myelination, alterations in the blood-brain barrier, disorganization of
white matter architecture and vascularization, and hydrocephalus in
older mice associated with loss of white matter. They concluded that
GFAP is necessary for the long-term maintenance of normal CNS
myelination. Shibuki et al. (1996) observed that long-term depression at
parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses is deficient in GFAP knockout
mice. Furthermore, GFAP mutant mice exhibited a significant impairment
of eyeblink conditioning without any detectable deficits in motor
coordination tasks. They concluded that GFAP may be required for
communications between Bergmann glia and Purkinje cells during long-term
depression induction and maintenance.

Hagemann et al. (2005) performed gene expression analysis on olfactory
bulbs of transgenic mice overexpressing wildtype human GFAP at 2
different ages. Expression profiles revealed a stress response that
included genes involved in glutathione metabolism, peroxide
detoxification, and iron homeostasis. Many of these genes are regulated
by the transcription factor Nfe2l2 (600492), which is also increased in
expression at 3 weeks. An immune-related response occurred with
activation of cytokine and cytokine receptor genes, complement
components, and acute phase response genes. These transcripts were
further elevated with age, with additional induction of
macrophage-specific markers, such as Mac1 (ITGAM; 120980) and CD68
(153634), suggesting activation of microglia. At 4 months, decreased
expression of genes for microtubule-associated proteins, vesicular
trafficking proteins, and neurotransmitter receptors became apparent.
Interneuron-specific transcription factors, including Dlx family members
and Pax6 (607108), were downregulated as well as Gad1 (605363) and Gad2
(138275), suggesting impairment of GABAergic granule cells. Hagemann et
al. (2005) proposed a mechanism wherein an initial stress response by
astrocytes results in the activation of microglia and compromised
neuronal function.

Hagemann et al. (2009) noted that Rosenthal fibers in the complex
astrocytic inclusions characteristic of Alexander disease contain GFAP,
vimentin (VIM; 193060), plectin (PLEC1; 601282), ubiquitin (UBB;
191339), HSP27 (HSPB1; 602195), and alpha-B-crystallin (CRYAB; 123590).
CRYAB regulates GFAP assembly, and elevation of CRYAB is a consistent
feature of Alexander disease; however, its role in Rosenthal fibers and
disease pathology is not known. In a mouse model of Alexander disease,
Hagemann et al. (2009) showed that loss of Cryab resulted in increased
mortality, whereas elevation of Cryab rescued animals from terminal
seizures. When mice with Rosenthal fibers induced by overexpression of
GFAP were crossed into a Cryab-null background, over half died at 1
month of age. Restoration of Cryab expression through the GFAP promoter
reversed this outcome, showing the effect was astrocyte-specific.
Conversely, in mice carrying an Alexander disease-associated mutation
and in mice overexpressing wildtype GFAP, which, despite natural
induction of Cryab also died at 1 month, transgenic overexpression of
Cryab resulted in a markedly reduced CNS stress response, restored
expression of the glutamate transporter Glt1 (SLC1A2; 600300), and
protected these animals from death.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG239CYS

Brenner et al. (2001) found that 5 unrelated patients with Alexander
disease (203450) were heterozygous for mutations in codon 239 of the
GFAP gene. In 4 of these, a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 729 led to
an arg239-to-cys mutation (R239C). Age at death in these 4 patients
varied from 4 years to 11 years. The fifth patient had an arg239-to-his
mutation (137780.0002). DNA was normal in the parents where available.

In a 1-year-old female with typical features of Alexander disease,
Shiroma et al. (2001) identified the frequent R239C missense mutation.
The patient was born of nonconsanguineous parents. Early developmental
milestones were normal, but at the age of 1 year she had the first
febrile seizure, and after 2 weeks she had status epilepticus with
fever. Thereafter, she lost the ability to stand with help and to speak
words. Examination showed increased head circumference (+2.3 SD) and
good social response. Plantar responses were bilaterally extensor. In
addition to the typical manifestations of macrocephaly, psychomotor
retardation, spasticity, and seizures, the radiologic findings were
typical of Alexander disease.

Rodriguez et al. (2001) found the arg239-to-cys mutation in heterozygous
state in 4 of 14 patients with infantile Alexander disease. One of the
patients was 18 months old at the time of onset, underwent deterioration
of psychomotor development at the age of 6 years, had a head
circumference of 1.5 standard deviations above the mean, and was alive
at age 8 years.

Li et al. (2005) reported 2 unrelated patients with juvenile-onset
Alexander disease who were heterozygous for the R239C mutation. One
patient had onset at age 2 years and the other at age 4 years.

.0002
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG239HIS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Brenner et al. (2001)
identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 730 of the GFAP gene,
causing an arg239-to-his substitution. This infant died at the age of 11
months. Four other patients had an arg239-to-cys mutation; see
137780.0001.

Li et al. (2005) reported 5 unrelated patients with Alexander disease
resulting from the R239H mutation. All patients had a severe form of the
disease, with onset by age 6 months and death by age 5 years.

.0003
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG416TRP

In 2 unrelated patients with Alexander disease (203450) that led to
death at ages 7 and 8, respectively, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1260 of the GFAP gene, resulting in an
arg416-to-trp substitution.

Li et al. (2005) noted that the R416W mutation had been identified in
patients with infantile-, juvenile-, and adult-onset Alexander disease.

A pathologic hallmark of Alexander disease is the abundance of protein
aggregates in astrocytes. These aggregates, termed Rosenthal fibers,
contain the protein chaperones alpha-B crystallin (123590) and HSP27
(602195) as well as GFAP. Perng et al. (2006) showed that the R416W
mutation in GFAP significantly perturbs in vitro filament assembly. The
filamentous structures formed resemble assembly intermediates but
aggregated more strongly. Consistent with the heterozygosity of the
mutation, this effect was dominant over wildtype GFAP in coassembly
experiments. Transient transfection studies demonstrated that R416W GFAP
induces the formation of GFAP-containing cytoplasmic aggregates in a
wide range of different cell types, including astrocytes. Monoclonal
antibodies specific for R146W GFAP revealed, for the first time for any
intermediate filament-based disease, the presence of the mutant protein
in the characteristic histopathologic features of the disease, namely,
Rosenthal fibers. The data confirmed that the effects of the R416W GFAP
are dominant, changing the assembly process in a way that encourages
aberrant filament-filament interactions that then lead to protein
aggregation and chaperone sequestration as early events in Alexander
disease.

.0004
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG79HIS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450) with onset at age 10 years
and death at age 48 years, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 250 of the GFAP gene, leading to an
arg79-to-his substitution. Brenner et al. (2001) found the same mutation
in a patient with Alexander disease still living at the age of 8 years.

.0005
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG79CYS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450) with onset at 3 months and
death at 14 years, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a C-to-T transition
at nucleotide 249 of the GFAP gene, leading to an arg79-to-cys (R79C)
substitution. Brenner et al. (2001) found the same mutation in a patient
with Alexander disease still living at the age of 7 years.

Caroli et al. (2007) identified the R79C mutation in 3 unrelated Italian
boys with Alexander disease. All had onset before age 10 months. One of
the patients died at age 19 years.

.0006
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG88CYS

In 2 unrelated patients with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et
al. (2001) found an arg88-to-cys (R88C) mutation in the GFAP gene.

.0007
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG88SER

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found an arg88-to-ser (R88S) missense mutation in heterozygous state in
the GFAP gene.

.0008

GFAP, LEU76PHE

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found a leu76-to-phe (L76F) heterozygous missense mutation in the GFAP
gene.

ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ASN77TYR

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found a de novo, heterozygous missense mutation, asn77-to-tyr (N77Y), in
the GFAP gene.

ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, GLU362ASP

In a patient with juvenile-onset Alexander disease (203450), Sawaishi et
al. (2002) identified a homozygous 1100G-C transition in the GFAP gene,
resulting in a glu362-to-asp substitution. A brother and the parents did
not carry the mutation. The mutation occurred in the C-terminal end of
the central rod domain, a highly conserved region of GFAP and other
types of intermediate filaments (e.g., vimentin (193060), desmin
(125660), keratin-1 (139350)).

ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG276LEU

In 2 Japanese brothers with Alexander disease (203450), Namekawa et al.
(2002) described an 841G-T transition at nucleotide 841, resulting in an
arg276-to-leu (R276L) substitution. Both brothers had spastic paresis
without palatal myoclonus, and MRI showed marked atrophy of the medulla
oblongata and cervicothoracic cord. The autopsy showed severely involved
shrunken pyramids but scarce Rosenthal fibers. Moderate numbers of
Rosenthal fibers were observed in the stratum subcallosum and
hippocampal fimbria. One patient was well until age 33; the second
brother developed regressive spastic gait at the age of 48 years and
gradually noticed that he could not raise his left arm. The parents were
nonconsanguineous and both died in their eighth decade without apparent
evidence of a neurologic disorder. They had only the 2 offspring, both
of whom had no children. The R276L mutation was heterozygous in both
brothers. Assuming accurate attribution of paternity, one might suggest
that this represented an example of parental gonadal mosaicism.

.0012
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, LEU352PRO

In a patient with a severe form of infantile Alexander disease (203450),
Bassuk et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 1055T-C transition in the
GFAP gene, resulting in a leu352-to-pro (L352P) substitution. Residue
352 is a highly conserved amino acid that is found in all intermediate
filament proteins and across species.

.0013
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ASP78GLU

In a family with an autosomal dominant adult form of Alexander disease
(203450), Stumpf et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous C-to-A change
in exon 1 of the GFAP gene, resulting in an asp78-to-glu (D78E)
substitution. Amino acid 78 lies in the rod domain of the protein. The
clinical phenotype varied in severity, but the pattern of evolution was
similar in all affected members. Although sleep disturbances and
dysautonomia, primarily constipation, began in childhood, the major
neurologic features began in the third or fourth decade of life. MRI of
the older patients showed atrophy of the medulla without signal
abnormalities.

114180	TITLE *114180 CALMODULIN 1; CALM1
;;PHOSPHORYLASE KINASE, DELTA SUBUNIT; PHKD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calmodulin is the archetype of the family of calcium-modulated proteins
of which nearly 20 members have been found. They are identified by their
occurrence in the cytosol or on membranes facing the cytosol and by a
high affinity for calcium. Calmodulin contains 149 amino acids and has 4
calcium-binding domains. Its functions include roles in growth and the
cell cycle as well as in signal transduction and the synthesis and
release of neurotransmitters.

CLONING

Until the studies of Sen Gupta et al. (1987), only 1 human calmodulin
cDNA had been reported. These authors found evidence of a second
actively transcribed calmodulin gene in man. Calmodulin is the delta
subunit of phosphorylase kinase, which has 3 other types of subunits.
Although only 1 form of calmodulin has been found in humans, 3 distinct
human cDNAs have been isolated that encode the identical polypeptide
(Koller et al., 1990; Pegues and Friedberg, 1990). The existence of 3
expressible genes for calmodulin may indicate that one is a housekeeping
gene and that the additional copies are differentially regulated to
modulate calmodulin function.

Rhyner et al. (1994) detected expression of CALM1 in all human tissues
tested, although at varying levels. They identified 2 different
CALM1-related pseudogenes.

Toutenhoofd et al. (1998) found that all 3 CALM genes were expressed in
human teratocarcinoma cells. CALM1 was expressed as a major 1.7-kb
transcript and a minor 4.1-kb transcript. CALM1 was at least 5-fold less
actively transcribed than CALM3 (114183).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

To determine how calcium/calmodulin activates
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CAMK1; 604998), Chin et
al. (1997) characterized CAMK1 activation by calmodulin mutants with
substitutions at hydrophobic residues. They found that CAMK1 activity is
dependent on met124 within the C-terminal domain of calmodulin as well
as on N-terminal hydrophobic residues of calmodulin.

Kretsinger et al. (1986) described the crystal structure of calmodulin
to 3.6-angstrom resolution.

Schumacher et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of calmodulin
bound to KCNN2 (605879). The calmodulin-binding domain forms an
elongated dimer with a calmodulin molecule bound at each end; each
calmodulin wraps around 3 alpha-helices, 2 from 1 calmodulin-binding
domain subunit and 1 from the other.

Edema factor, the exotoxin of the anthrax bacillus, is transported into
host cells by an anthrax-derived transporter, protective antigen.
Together with lethal factor (see 603060), edema factor contributes
significantly to both cutaneous and systemic anthrax and is an adenylyl
cyclase activated by CALM1. Drum et al. (2002) described the crystal
structures of edema factor alone and edema factor with CALM1 and
3-prime-deoxy-ATP. On calmodulin binding, an edema factor helical domain
of 15 kD undergoes a 15-angstrom translation and a 30-degree rotation
away from the edema factor catalytic core, which stabilizes a disordered
loop and leads to enzyme activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rhyner et al. (1994) found that the CALM1 gene contains 6 exons spread
over about 10 kb of genomic DNA. The exon-intron structure was identical
to that of CALM3. A cluster of transcription-start sites was identified
200 bp upstream of the ATG translation-start codon, and several putative
regulatory elements were found in the 5-prime flanking region, as well
as in intron 1. A short CAG trinucleotide repeat region was identified
in the 5-prime untranslated region of the gene.

Toutenhoofd et al. (1998) determined that of the 3 CALM genes, only
CALM1 contains a canonical TATA box. Like CALM3, the 5-prime region of
CALM1 is highly GC rich.

MAPPING

McPherson et al. (1991) used a panel of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids to demonstrate that the cDNA probe for CALM1 was localized to
chromosome 14 with cross-hybridization evident on chromosome 7 and very
weak on the X chromosome. The assignments to chromosomes 14 and 7
confirmed an earlier report by Scambler et al. (1987). McPherson et al.
(1991) tentatively assigned the CALM2 (114182) gene to chromosome 10,
but the gene was subsequently shown to be on chromosome 2. They assigned
the cDNA probe for CALM3 unequivocally to chromosome 19. There was no
apparent cross-hybridization to other chromosomes. A calmodulin
pseudogene is located on chromosome 17 (Sen Gupta et al., 1989) and
there are probably more on several other chromosomes. Berchtold et al.
(1993) assigned the CALM1 gene to chromosome 14 by PCR-based
amplification of CALM1-specific sequences using DNA from human/hamster
cell hybrids as template. Regional sublocalization was performed by in
situ hybridization using CALM1-specific DNA probes of intronic or
flanking parts of the gene; the regional localization was found to be
14q24-q31.

GENE FUNCTION

To understand the relationship between the number of calmodulin
molecules regulating each L-type calcium channel (see 114205) and the
number of calmodulin molecules privy to the local calcium signal from
each channel, Mori et al. (2004) fused L-type calcium channels to single
calmodulin molecules. These chimeric molecules revealed that a single
calmodulin molecule directs L-type channel regulation. Similar fusion
molecules were used to estimate the local calmodulin concentration near
calcium channels. This estimate indicates marked enrichment of local
calmodulin, as if a school of nearby calmodulins were poised to enhance
the transduction of local calcium entry into diverse signaling pathways.

Junge et al. (2004) identified a conserved calmodulin-binding site in
Munc13s (see 605836), which are essential regulators of synaptic vesicle
priming and synaptic efficacy. They showed that Ca(2+) sensor/effector
complexes consisting of calmodulin and Munc13s regulate synaptic vesicle
priming and synaptic efficacy in response to a residual Ca(2+)
concentration signal and thus shape short-term plasticity
characteristics during periods of sustained synaptic activity.

Dick et al. (2008) showed that the spatial calcium ion selectivity of
N-lobe calmodulin regulation is not invariably global but can be
switched by a novel calcium ion/calmodulin binding site within the amino
terminus of channels (NSCaTE, for N-terminal spatial calcium ion
transforming element). Native Ca(v)2.2 channels lack this element and
show N-lobe regulation with a global selectivity. On the introduction of
NSCaTE into these channels, spatial calcium ion selectivity transforms
from a global to local profile. Given this effect, Dick et al. (2008)
examined Ca(v)1.2/Ca(v)1.3 channels, which naturally contain NSCaTE, and
found that their N-lobe selectivity is indeed local. Disruption of this
element produces a global selectivity, confirming the native function of
NSCaTE. Thus, Dick et al. (2008) concluded that differences in spatial
selectivity between advanced Ca(v)1 and Ca(v)2 channel isoforms are
explained by the presence or absence of NSCaTE. Beyond functional
effects, the position of NSCaTE on the channel's amino terminus
indicates that calmodulin can bridge the amino terminus and carboxy
terminus of channels. Finally, the modularity of NSCaTE offers practical
means for understanding the basis of global calcium ion selectivity.

Liu et al. (2010) combined electrophysiology to characterize channel
regulation with optical fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
sensor determination of free-apoCaM concentration in live cells. This
approach translates quantitative calmodulin biochemistry from the
traditional test-tube context into the realm of functioning holochannels
within intact cells. From this perspective, Liu et al. (2010) found that
long splice forms of Ca(V)1.3 (CACNA1D; 114206) and Ca(V)1.4 (CACNA1F;
300110) channels include a distal carboxy tail that resembles an enzyme
competitive inhibitor that retunes channel affinity for apocalmodulin
such that natural calmodulin variations affect the strength of Ca(2+)
feedback modulation. Given the ubiquity of these channels, the
connection between ambient calmodulin levels and Ca(2+) entry through
channels is broadly significant for Ca(2+) homeostasis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia 4

In a large 4-generation Swedish family with autosomal dominant
catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT4; 614916),
Nyegaard et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation
in the CALM1 gene (N53I; 114180.0001) that segregated fully with disease
in the family and was not found in 1,200 controls. A de novo missense
mutation in CALM1 (N97S; 114180.0002) was subsequently identified in a
23-year-old Iraqi woman with a history of cardiac arrest at 4 years of
age due to ventricular fibrillation while running. Both substitutions
demonstrated compromised calcium binding.

- Association with Osteoarthritis

In 2 independent Japanese populations totaling 428 osteoarthritis (OA;
165720) patients and 1,008 controls, Mototani et al. (2005) identified
significant association between hip OA and a -16C-T promoter SNP (dbSNP
rs12885713) in the CALM1 gene. Functional analysis indicated that the
-16T allele decreased CALM1 transcription in vitro and in vivo. CALM1
was expressed in cultured chondrocytes and articular cartilage, and its
expression was increased in OA. Inhibition of CALM1 in chondrogenic
cells reduced expression of the major cartilage matrix genes COL2A1
(120140) and AGC1 (155760). Mototani et al. (2005) suggested that the
transcriptional level of CALM1 may be associated with susceptibility for
hip OA through modulation of chondrogenic activity.

ANIMAL MODEL

A classic textbook example of adaptive radiation under natural selection
is the evolution of 14 closely related species of Darwin's finches,
whose primary diversity lies in the size and shape of their beaks. The
precise dimensions (length, depth, and width) of each species' beak are
crucial to their lifestyle and survival, and fluctuations in the
environment lead to selection that changes the relative success of birds
with various beak shapes. These evolutionary processes are evident in
real time on the Galapagos Islands (Grant and Grant, 2006). Abzhanov et
al. (2004) showed that the BMP4 gene (112262), which plays a role in
skeletal and cartilaginous development in mice, is more broadly
expressed during the embryonic development of the deep and wide beaks of
ground finches than during the development of finches with narrower
beaks. Using a cDNA microarray analysis of the transcripts expressed in
the beak primordia to find previously unknown genes and pathways whose
expression correlates with specific beak morphologies, Abzhanov et al.
(2006) found that calmodulin is expressed at much higher levels in the
long and pointed beaks of cactus finch embryos than in the beaks of
other finch embryos. They showed further that when upregulation of the
calmodulin-dependent pathway is artificially replicated in the chick
frontonasal prominence, it causes an elongation of the upper beak,
recapitulating the beak morphology of the cactus finches. The results
indicated that local upregulation of the calmodulin-dependent pathway is
likely to have been a component in the evolution of Darwin's finch
species with elongated beak morphology and provide a mechanistic
explanation for the independence of beak evolution along different axes,
e.g., broad versus elongated. More generally, their results implicated
the calmodulin-dependent pathway in the developmental regulation of
craniofacial skeletal structures.

HISTORY

Scambler et al. (1987) identified a calmodulin-like locus, designated
CALML1, on chromosome 7pter-p13 by study of somatic cell hybrids. Based
on map and other indirect evidence, Scott (2007) concluded that this
locus is a pseudogene (CALM1P2).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, CATECHOLAMINERGIC POLYMORPHIC, 4
CALM1, ASN53ILE

In 10 affected members of a large 4-generation Swedish family with
catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT4; 614916),
Nyegaard et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity for a 161A-T
transversion in exon 3 of the CALM1 gene, resulting in an asn53-to-ile
(N53I) substitution at a highly conserved residue within the first
alpha-helix of Ca(2+)-binding site II. The mutation was not found in
unaffected family members or in 1,200 controls. Functional analysis
demonstrated that the mutant had significantly reduced Ca(2+) affinity
compared to wildtype.

VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, CATECHOLAMINERGIC POLYMORPHIC, 4
CALM1, ASN97SER

In a 23-year-old Iraqi woman with catecholaminergic polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia (CPVT4; 614916), Nyegaard et al. (2012)
identified heterozygosity for a de novo 293A-G transition in exon 5 of
the CALM1 gene, resulting in an asn97-to-ser (N97S) substitution at a
highly conserved Ca(2+)-binding residue within the high-affinity
binding-site III in the calmodulin C domain. The mutation was not found
in her unaffected parents or in 500 Danish controls, and the patient was
negative for mutation in 8 other arrhythmia-associated genes. At age 4
years, the patient underwent cardiac arrest due to ventricular
fibrillation while running; she was stabilized by treatment with a
beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed
prominent U-waves in anterior leads but no evidence for long QT or
Brugada syndromes. At 12 years of age, an off-medication exercise ECG
demonstrated ventricular ectopy with couplets and triplets of varying
morphology, which appeared to be bidirectional at times. At age 15, she
suffered a second cardiac arrest and underwent implantation of an
internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD). Functional analysis demonstrated
that the mutant had significantly reduced Ca(2+) affinity compared to
wildtype calmodulin. In addition, for the N97S mutant, calmodulin-RYR2
(180902) interaction was defective at low intracellular Ca(2+)
concentrations and restored at moderate to high Ca(2+) concentrations.

610576	TITLE *610576 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 9; ARHGAP9
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the RHO (see ARHA; 165390) family of small GTPases are
involved in multiple signaling processes, and they are active in their
GTP-bound form and inactive in their GDP-bound form. RHO GAPs, such as
ARHGAP9, inactivate RHO GTPases by stimulating their intrinsic GTPase
activity (Furukawa et al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening a human thymus cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Furukawa et al. (2001) cloned ARHGAP9. The deduced 731-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal SH3 domain, followed by a WW domain, a
pleckstrin homology domain, and a C-terminal GAP domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.6-kb transcript in peripheral blood, spleen, and
thymus only. By phylogenetic analysis, Peck et al. (2002) determined
that the GAP domain of ARHGAP9 is most closely related to the GAP domain
of ARHGAP12 (610577).

Using RT-PCR, Takefuji et al. (2010) detected strong expression of
ARHGAP9 in T cells and monocytes, with much weaker expression in human
aortic smooth muscle cells; the product was barely detected in human
umbilical vein and human coronary artery endothelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Furukawa et al. (2001) determined that the ARHGAP9 gene contains 18
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Peck et al. (2002) mapped the ARHGAP9 gene
to chromosome 12q14.

GENE FUNCTION

In vitro, Furukawa et al. (2001) demonstrated that recombinant ARHGAP9
showed substantial GAP activity toward CDC42 (116952) and RAC1 (602048),
and less toward ARHA. Exogenous ARHGAP9 expression repressed the
adhesion of a human leukemia cell line to fibronectin (135600) and
collagen IV (see COL4A1; 120130). Furukawa et al. (2001) concluded that
ARHGAP9 regulates the adhesion of hematopoietic cells to extracellular
matrix.

Takefuji et al. (2010) performed a Boyden chamber assay and found that
ARHGAP9 negatively regulates cell migration. Transfection studies in
COS-7 cells demonstrated that ARHGAP9 reduced the activity of RAC1
(602048) and RAC2 (602049).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

See 610576.0001 for discussion of a possible association between
variation in the ARHGAP9 gene and susceptibility to coronary artery
spasm.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKOWN SIGNIFICANCE
ARHGAP9, ALA370SER (dbSNP rs11544238)

This variant, formerly titled CORONARY ARTERY SPASM 3, SUSCEPTIBILITY
TO, has been reclassified because its contribution to the phenotype has
not been confirmed.

Takefuji et al. (2010) analyzed 67 missense SNPs in Rho-family GTPases
and their regulators in 103 unrelated Japanese individuals with
acetylcholine-induced coronary artery spasm and 102 Japanese controls
without acetylcholine-induced coronary artery spasm. They found a
significant association between coronary artery spasm and a C-A
transversion (dbSNP rs11544238) in the ARHGAP9 gene, resulting in an
ala370-to-ser (A370S) substitution in the PH domain (odds ratio, 2.67).
Boyden chamber assay demonstrated that the ser370 mutant had a weaker
inhibitory effect on cell migration, spreading, and adhesion than
wildtype protein. Takefuji et al. (2010) suggested that ARHGAP9
variation has a critical function in the infiltration of hematopoietic
cells into the endothelium and inflammation leading to endothelial
dysfunction.

603054	TITLE *603054 GREMLIN 1 HOMOLOG, CYSTINE KNOT SUPERFAMILY; GREM1
;;GREMLIN;;
CYSTINE KNOT SUPERFAMILY 1, BMP ANTAGONIST 1; CKTSF1B1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a Xenopus expression-cloning screen, Hsu et al. (1998) isolated
GREM1, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; see 112264)
signaling that is expressed in the neural crest. Gremlin-1 belongs to a
novel gene family that includes the head-inducing factor cerberus (CER1;
603777) and the tumor suppressor DAN (600613). Hsu et al. (1998) showed
that all family members are secreted proteins and that they act as BMP
antagonists in embryonic explants. They also provided support for the
model that gremlin, cerberus, and DAN block BMP signaling by binding
BMPs, preventing them from interacting with their receptors. They
proposed that gremlin, cerberus, and DAN control diverse processes in
growth and development by selectively antagonizing the activities of
different subsets of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta ligands.
By homology searches, Hsu et al. (1998) cloned the human homolog of
Xenopus gremlin. The human gremlin cDNA encodes a predicted 184-amino
acid protein.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Topol et al.
(2000) mapped the GREM1 gene to human chromosome 15q13-q15.

GENE FUNCTION

Zuniga et al. (1999) reported that the secreted BMP antagonist gremlin
relays the Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signal from the polarizing
region to the apical ectodermal ridge. Mesenchymal gremlin expression is
lost in limb buds of mouse embryos homozygous for the 'limb deformity'
(ld) mutation, which disrupts establishment of the Shh/Fgf4 (164980)
feedback loop. Grafting gremlin-expressing cells into ld mutant limb
buds rescued Fgf4 expression and restored the Shh/Fgf4 feedback loop.
Analysis of Shh-null mutant embryos revealed that Shh signaling is
required for maintenance of gremlin and formin (FMN1; 136535), the gene
disrupted by the ld mutations. In contrast, formin, gremlin, and Fgf4
activation were independent of Shh signaling. Zuniga et al. (1999)
concluded that the study uncovered the cascade by which the SHH signal
is relayed from the posterior mesenchyme to the apical ectodermal ridge
and established that formin-dependent activation of the BMP antagonist
gremlin is sufficient to induce Fgf4 and establish the SHH/Fgf4 feedback
loop.

Vertebrate limb outgrowth is driven by a positive feedback loop
involving SHH, gremlin, and FGF4. By overexpressing individual
components of the loop at a time after these genes are normally
downregulated in chicken embryos, Scherz et al. (2004) found that Shh no
longer maintains gremlin in the posterior limb. Shh-expressing cells and
their descendants cannot express gremlin. The proliferation of these
descendants forms a barrier separating the Shh signal from
gremlin-expressing cells, which breaks down the Shh-Fgf4 loop and
thereby affects limb size and provides a mechanism explaining regulative
properties of the limb bud.

Developmentally regulated programmed cell death sculpts the limbs and
other embryonic organs in vertebrates. In chickens and mice, Bmps
trigger apoptosis of the interdigital mesenchyme, leading to freed
digits, whereas in ducks, Bmp antagonists inhibit the apoptotic program,
resulting in webbed feet. Weatherbee et al. (2006) found the bat C.
perspicillata utilizes a unique combination of high Fgf8 (600483) and
gremlin expression to maintain interdigit tissue in the forelimb,
resulting in simultaneously elevated Fgf signaling and inhibited Bmp
signaling.

Wordinger et al. (2007) studied the effects of altered BMP signaling on
intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG; see
137760). They found that the human trabecular meshwork (TM) synthesized
and secreted BMP4 (112262) as well as expressed the BMP receptor
subtypes BMPR1 (see 601299) and BMPR2 (600799). TM cells responded to
exogenous BMP4 by phosphorylating SMAD signaling proteins (see 601595).
Cultured human TM cells treated with TGFB2 (190220) significantly
increased fibronectin (FN; 135600) levels, and BMP4 blocked this FN
induction. There was significant elevation of mRNA and protein levels of
the BMP antagonist gremlin in glaucomatous TM cells. In addition,
gremlin was present in human aqueous humor. Gremlin blocked the negative
effect of BMP4 on TGFB2 induction of FN. Addition of recombinant gremlin
to the medium of ex vivo perfusion-cultured human eye anterior segments
caused the glaucoma phenotype of elevated IOP. Wordinger et al. (2007)
concluded that these results were consistent with the hypothesis that,
in POAG, elevated expression of gremlin by TM cells inhibited BMP4
antagonism of TGFB2 and led to increased extracellular matrix deposition
and elevated IOP.

Limb development is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loops
between SHH and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling involving the
bone morphogenetic protein antagonist gremlin-1. By combining mouse
molecular genetics with mathematical modeling, Benazet et al. (2009)
showed that BMP4 first initiates and SHH then propagates
epithelial-mesenchymal feedback signaling through differential
transcriptional regulation of Grem1 to control digit specification. This
switch occurs by linking a fast BMP4/GREM1 module to the slower
SHH/GREM1/FGF epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loop. This self-regulatory
signaling network results in robust regulation of distal limb
development that is able to compensate for variations by
interconnectivity among the 3 signaling pathways.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 8 Ashkenazi Jewish families segregating autosomal
dominant hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome mapping to chromosome
15q13.3 (HMPS1; 601228), Jaeger et al. (2012) identified heterozygosity
for an approximately 40-kb duplication centered on chr. 15:30.77 Mb that
was not found in 188 unselected Ashkenazi controls or in 935 controls
from the Colorectal Tumour Gene Identification (CORGI) study. PCR
amplification across the duplication breakpoints mapped it to chr.
15:30,752,231-30,792,051 (NCBI36), and the change was found to be a
simple tandem tail-head duplication with insertion of a 30-bp sequence
of unknown origin that had no homology to known sequences between the
duplicons. The duplication extended from intron 2 of the SCG5 gene to a
site just upstream of the GREM1 CpG island; however, only the normal
SCG5 mRNA species was found, and there were no significant differences
in SCG5 expression compared to controls. In contrast, markedly increased
GREM1 transcript levels were detected in the normal epithelium of HMPS
patients compared to controls, and allele-specific expression analysis
showed significantly increased expression of the duplicated allele in
HMPS crypts. In normal colorectal crypts of controls and unaffected
relatives, GREM1 expression was restricted to intestinal subepithelial
myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) at the crypt base, whereas in normal colorectal
crypts of HMPS patients, GREM1 was expressed not only in basal ISEMFs
but also at very high levels in epithelial cells, predominantly
colonocytes, with expression extending most of the way up the sides of
the crypts. Increased GREM1 expression was also seen in HMPS polyps, but
to a lesser extent than in normal epithelium. Jaeger et al. (2012)
demonstrated that a 3-kb region within the duplication (chr.
15:30,779,000-30,782,000, NCBI36) enhanced GREM1 expression 4-fold in
the SW948 CRC cell line and that the region interacts directly with the
GREM1 promoter. Increased GREM1 expression was predicted to cause
reduced BMP (see 112264) pathway activity, a mechanism that also
underlies tumorigenesis in juvenile polyposis of the large bowel
(174900).

ANIMAL MODEL

During limb outgrowth, signaling by BMPs must be moderated to maintain
the signaling loop between the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) and the
apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Gremlin, an extracellular BMP antagonist,
has been proposed to fulfill this function and therefore be important in
limb patterning. Khokha et al. (2003) tested this model directly by
mutating the mouse gene encoding gremlin. In the mutant limb, the
feedback loop between the ZPA and the AER was interrupted, resulting in
abnormal skeletal pattern. The phenotype is apparently identical to that
of ld, which results from a mutation in the Fmn1 gene (136535). The
relationship between Grem1 and Fmn1 is interesting because of their
proximity in the mouse genome. The Fmn1 transcript comprises a large
number of exons with the most 3-prime exon located approximately 40 kb
from the gremlin open reading frame. Given the apparently identical
phenotype of ld mice to gremlin mutant mice and the proximity of Fmn1 to
Grem1, Khokha et al. (2003) tested whether gremlin would complement ld.
They found that gremlin fails to complement ld and thus identified
another ld allele. Although a complex interaction between Fmn1 and
gremlin is possible, Khokha et al. (2003) favored the idea that the ld
mutations affect gremlin expression directly and that they lie in
cis-regulatory elements for gremlin expression.

Limb bud outgrowth is driven by signals in a positive feedback loop
involving fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) genes, Sonic hedgehog (Shh;
600725), and Grem1. Precise termination of these signals is essential to
restrict limb bud size. That the sequence in mouse limb buds is
different from that in chick limb buds drove Verheyden and Sun (2008) to
explore alternative mechanisms. By analyzing compound mouse mutants
defective in genes comprising the positive loop, Verheyden and Sun
(2008) provided genetic evidence that Fgf signaling can repress Grem1
expression, revealing a novel Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. The repression
occurs in both mouse and chick limb buds and is dependent on high Fgf
activity. These data supported a mechanism where the positive Fgf/Shh
loop drives outgrowth and an increase in Fgf signaling, which triggers
the Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. The inhibitory loop then operates to
terminate outgrowth signals in the order observed in either mouse or
chick limb buds. Verheyden and Sun (2008) concluded that their study
unveils the concept of a self-promoting and self-terminating circuit
that may be used to attain proper tissue size in a broad spectrum of
developmental and regenerative settings. Verheyden and Sun (2008)
demonstrated that Fgf8 (600483) repression of Fgf4 (164980) expression
is dependent on Grem1 but not Shh.

137025	TITLE *137025 FYN ONCOGENE RELATED TO SRC, FGR, YES; FYN
;;FYN TYROSINE KINASE PROTOONCOGENE;;
SRC-LIKE KINASE; SLK;;
SYN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a genomic library with a YES1 (164880) gene probe, Semba et
al. (1986) identified a related gene, which they called SYN
(src/yes-related novel gene). Northern blot analysis revealed that the
2.8-kb SYN mRNA was expressed in various cell types. The tyrosine kinase
domain of the predicted 537-amino acid SYN protein is 77 to 80%
identical to those of the YES1, FGR (164940), and chicken SRC (190090)
tyrosine kinase oncogenes. Therefore, Semba et al. (1986) concluded that
SYN is a new member of the tyrosine kinase oncogene family.

GENE FUNCTION

PrPc, the cellular, nonpathogenic isoform of prion protein (Prp;
176640), is a ubiquitous glycoprotein expressed strongly in neurons.
Mouillet-Richard et al. (2000) used the murine 1C11 neuronal
differentiation model to search for PrPc-dependent signal transduction
through antibody-mediated crosslinking. The 1C11 clone is a committed
neuroectodermal progenitor with an epithelial morphology that lacks
neuron-associated functions. Upon induction, 1C11 cells develop a
neural-like morphology, and may differentiate either into serotonergic
or noradrenergic cells. The choice between the 2 differentiation
pathways depends on the set of inducers used. Ligation of PrPc with
specific antibodies induced a marked decrease in the phosphorylation
level of the tyrosine kinase FYN in both serotonergic and noradrenergic
cells. The coupling of PrPc to FYN was dependent upon caveolin-1
(601047). Mouillet-Richard et al. (2000) suggested that clathrin (see
118960) might also contribute to this coupling. The ability of the 1C11
cell line to trigger PrPc-dependent FYN activation was restricted to its
fully differentiated serotonergic or noradrenergic progenies. Moreover,
the signaling activity of PrPc occurred mainly at neurites.
Mouillet-Richard et al. (2000) suggested that PrPc may be a signal
transduction protein.

Parravicini et al. (2002) noted that Lyn (165120) deficiency impairs
some mast cell functions, but degranulation and cytokine production are
intact. In Gab2 (606203)-deficient mice, on the other hand,
degranulation and cytokine production are impaired. Using immunoblot
analysis, they showed that although Lyn is essential for Syk (600085)
activation and Lat (602354) phosphorylation after Fcer1 (see FCER1G;
147139) aggregation, neither Lyn nor Lat are necessary for Gab2
phosphorylation. RT-PCR and coimmunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated
abundant Fyn expression in mast cells and an association with Gab2. In
cells lacking Fyn, neither Gab2 nor Akt (164730) were phosphorylated.
Functional analysis showed that Lyn -/- mast cells exhibited
hyperdegranulation and enhanced PI3K (see 601232) activity and Akt
phosphorylation, whereas in Fyn -/- mast cells the degranulation
response was inhibited. The inhibition was associated with decreased
binding of PI3K with Gab2. Parravicini et al. (2002) observed that the
degranulation response was independent of Fcer1 stimulation in
Fyn-deficient mast cells and that degranulation was dependent on PI3K in
wildtype and mutant cell lines. The degranulation response was dependent
on a rise in intracellular calcium that was inhibited in Lyn-deficient
mast cells but intact in Fyn-deficient cells. Degranulation proceeded in
Lyn -/- cells due to increased activation and constitutive
phosphorylation of the calcium-independent protein kinase C delta
isoform (PRKCD; 176977). Parravicini et al. (2002) concluded that Fyn-
and Lyn-initiated pathways synergize in late events at the level of
protein kinase C and calcium, respectively, to regulate mast cell
degranulation.

Using yeast 2-hybrid, immunoblot, and structural analyses, Chan et al.
(2003) showed that the SH2 domain of SAP (SH2D1A; 300490) bound to the
SH3 domain of FYN in a noncanonical manner and directly coupled FYN to
SLAM (SLAMF1; 603492).

Netrin-1 (601614) plays a role in the developing nervous system by
promoting both axonal outgrowth and axonal guidance in pathfinding. Liu
et al. (2004), Li et al. (2004), and Ren et al. (2004) simultaneously
reported a complex network of intracellular signaling downstream from
netrin-1 involving DCC (120470), focal adhesion kinase (FAK; 600758),
and FYN. In neurons cultured from rat cerebral cortex, Liu et al. (2004)
found that netrin-1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and FYN, and
coimmunoprecipitation studies showed direct interaction of FAK and FYN
with DCC. Inhibition of FYN inhibited FAK phosphorylation, and FYN
mutants inhibited the attractive turning responses to netrin. Neurons
lacking the FAK gene showed reduced axonal outgrowth and attractive
turning responses to netrin. In cultured neurons from chick and mouse,
Li et al. (2004) found that netrin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
DCC and FAK. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that DCC interacted
directly with FAK and SRC to form a complex and that FAK and SRC
cooperated to stimulate DCC phosphorylation by SRC. Li et al. (2004)
suggested that phosphorylated DCC acts as a kinase-coupled receptor and
that FAK and SRC act downstream of DCC in netrin signaling. Ren et al.
(2004) found that inhibition of FAK phosphorylation inhibited
netrin-1-induced axonal outgrowth and guidance. The authors suggested
that FAK may also function as a scaffolding protein and play a role in
cytoskeletal reorganization that is necessary for neurite outgrowth and
turning.

MAPPING

Semba et al. (1986) assigned the SYN gene to chromosome 6 by analysis of
somatic cell hybrids. Popescu et al. (1987) mapped the FYN gene to 6q21
by use of in situ hybridization. Boyle et al. (1992) confirmed the
assignment to the proximal part of 6q21 by study of a panel of 13 hybrid
cell lines containing various fragments of chromosome 6. Using a single
interspecific backcross, Justice et al. (1990) demonstrated the location
of the Fyn gene in relation to other genes on mouse chromosome 10.

ANIMAL MODEL

Grant et al. (1992) found that mice homozygous for a fyn null mutation
had impaired long-term potentiation and spatial learning. Yagi et al.
(1993) generated fyn-deficient mice by inserting the lacZ gene into the
fyn gene. Homozygous mutant mice appeared normal. However, the
homozygous fyn mutant neonates from homozygous fyn mutant parents died
because of a suckling problem. The mutant neonates suckled normally when
the fyn mutant mothers' mammary glands had been activated by suckling of
a heterozygous or wildtype pup. In homozygous mutant pups, the modified
glomerular complex of the olfactory bulb, thought to be involved in
pheromone perception, was abnormally shaped and reduced in size and the
hippocampal cell-layer was undulated. Since suckling is mediated by
pheromones, Yagi et al. (1993) speculated that the suckling problem
might be due to altered pheromone sensitivity. Yagi et al. (1993) noted
that Grant et al. (1992) did not observe a suckling defect in fyn mutant
mice. Yagi et al. (1993) suggested that this might be due to the fact
that the mice with a suckling defect had an insertional mutation in fyn,
while Grant et al. (1992) were studying mice with a null allele.

Cain et al. (1995) studied electrical kindling in mice containing a null
mutation in the fyn tyrosine kinase gene. Electrical kindling is
achieved by applying brief low intensity electrical stimuli over a
period of days to the brain, resulting in an electrical seizure focus
that may persist for months to years. The fyn mutants showed a striking
retardation in the rate of kindling, even though the phenomenon crucial
for kindling (i.e., the threshold duration and stability of epileptiform
after discharges) were normal. This implied to the authors that function
of the fyn gene is required for normal epileptogenesis.

SYK controls pre-B cell development but does not affect NFKB (164011)
induction. Saijo et al. (2003) showed that mice triple-deficient in the
Src family protein tyrosine kinases (SFKs) Blk (191305), Fyn, and Lyn,
but not single-deficient or Syk-deficient mice, had impaired Nfkb
induction and B-cell development. The impairment of Nfkb induction could
be overcome by protein kinase C-lambda (see 176982) activation. Saijo et
al. (2003) suggested that there are 2 separate pathways in pre-B cell
receptor signaling, one SFK-dependent and the other SYK-dependent, that
contribute critically to pre-B cell development.

601613	TITLE *601613 CHEMOKINE, CXC MOTIF, RECEPTOR 5; CXCR5
;;BURKITT LYMPHOMA RECEPTOR 1; BLR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dobner et al. (1992) and Kaiser et al. (1993) identified a novel member
of the G protein-coupled receptor family termed BLR1 (BLR1 having been
identified from Burkitt lymphoma).

GENE FUNCTION

B lymphocytes recirculate between B cell-rich compartments (follicles or
B zones) in secondary lymphoid organs, surveying for antigen. After
antigen binding, B cells move to the boundary of B and T zones to
interact with T-helper cells. Reif et al. (2002) demonstrated that
antigen-engaged B cells have increased expression of CCR7 (600242), the
receptor for the T-zone chemokines CCL19 (602227) and CCL21 (602737),
and that they exhibit increased responsiveness to both chemoattractants.
In mice lacking lymphoid CCL19 and CCL21 chemokines, or with B cells
that lack CCR7, antigen engagement fails to cause movement to the T
zone. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, the authors demonstrated
that increased expression of CCR7 is sufficient to direct B cells to the
T zone. Reciprocally, overexpression of CXCR5, the receptor for the
B-zone chemokine CXCL13 (also known as BLC), is sufficient to overcome
antigen-induced B-cell movement to the T zone. Reif et al. (2002)
concluded that their findings defined the mechanism of B-cell
relocalization in response to antigen, and established that cell
position in vivo can be determined by the balance of responsiveness to
chemoattractants made in separate but adjacent zones.

Chan et al. (2003) investigated the expression of chemokines and
chemokine receptors in eyes with primary intraocular B-cell lymphoma
(PIOL). All 3 PIOL eyes showed similar pathology, with typical diffuse
large B-lymphoma cells between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and
Bruch membrane. The eyes also showed a similar chemokine profile with
the expression of CXCR4 (162643) and CXCR5 in the lymphoma cells. CXCL13
(BLC) and CXCL12 (600835) transcripts were found only in the RPE and not
in the malignant cells. No chemokine expression was detected on the RPE
cells of a normal control eye. Since chemokines and chemokine receptors
selective for B cells were identified in RPE and malignant B cells in
eyes with PIOL, inhibition of B-cell chemoattractants might be a future
strategy for the treatment of PIOL.

The germinal center (GC) is organized into dark and light zones. B cells
in the dark zone, called centroblasts, undergo rapid proliferation and
somatic hypermutation of their antibody variable genes. Centroblasts
then become smaller, nondividing centrocytes and undergo selection in
the light zone based on the affinity of their surface antibody for the
inducing antigen. The light zone also contains helper T cells and
follicular dendritic cells that sequester antigen. Failure to
differentiate results in centrocyte apoptosis, whereas centrocytes that
bind antigen and receive T-cell help emigrate from the GC as long-lived
plasma cells or memory B cells. Some centrocytes may also return to the
dark zone for further proliferation and mutation. Using genetic and
pharmacologic approaches, Allen et al. (2004) showed that CXCR4 was
essential for GC dark and light zone segregation. In the presence of the
antiapoptotic BCL2 (151430), B cells had robust chemotactic responses to
the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, as well as to CXCL13, the ligand for CXCR5.
CXCL12 was more abundant in the dark zone, and CXCR4 was more abundant
on centroblasts than centrocytes. In contrast, CXCR5 helped direct cells
to the CXCL13-positive light zone, but was not essential for segregation
of the 2 zones. CXCL13 and CXCR5 were required for correct positioning
of the light zone. Allen et al. (2004) concluded that these chemokines
and their receptors are critical for movement of cells to different
parts of the GC and for creating the distinct histologic appearance of
the GC.

Using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, Cagigi et al. (2008)
found that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see
609423)-seropositive patients, particularly those with low CD4
(186940)-positive T-cell counts, had reduced expression of CXCR5 on B
cells, whereas expression of its ligand, CXCL13, was increased. CXCL13
was secreted upon B-cell activation. CXCL13-positive B cells were
present in lymph nodes of HIV-1-seropositive patients, but not in
control tissue. Cagigi et al. (2008) concluded that altered expression
of CXCR5 and CXCL13 may be involved in B-cell dysfunction during HIV-1
infection.

ANIMAL MODEL

Forster et al. (1996) described the phenotype of gene-targeted mice
lacking the putative chemokine receptor Blr1. In normal mice, this
receptor is expressed on mature B cells and a subpopulation of T helper
cells. Blr1-mutant mice lack inguinal lymph nodes and possess no or only
a few phenotypically abnormal Peyer patches. The migration of
lymphocytes into splenic follicles was severely impaired, resulting in
morphologically altered primary lymphoid follicles. Furthermore,
activated B cells failed to migrate from the T cell-rich zone into
B-cell follicles of the spleen, and despite high numbers of germinal
center founder cells, no functional germinal centers developed in this
organ. These results identified BLR1 as the first G protein-coupled
receptor involved in B cell migration and localization of these cells
within specific anatomic compartments.

CXCR5 was known to be required for B cell migration to splenic
follicles, but the requirements for homing to B-cell areas and lymph
nodes remained to be defined. Ansel et al. (2000) demonstrated that
lymph nodes contain 2 types of B cell-rich compartment: follicles
containing follicular dendritic cells, and areas lacking such cells.
Ansel et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in the B-lymphocyte
chemoattractant (BLC; 605149), for which CXCR5 is the receptor, by
targeted disruption. BLC-deficient mice were similar in appearance to
mice deficient in CXCR5. However, CXCR5-deficient mice have less severe
deficiency in Peyer patches. Using BLC-deficient mice, Ansel et al.
(2000) established that BLC and CXCR5 are needed for B-cell homing to
follicles in lymph nodes as well as in spleen. They also found that BLC
is required for the development of most lymph nodes and Peyer patches.
In addition to mediating chemoattraction, BLC induces B cells to
upregulate membrane lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 (see 600978), a cytokine
that promotes follicular dendritic cell development and BLC expression,
establishing a positive feedback loop thought to be important in
follicle development and homeostasis. In germinal centers, the feedback
loop is overridden, with B cell lymphotoxin alpha-1-beta-2 expression
being induced by a mechanism independent of BLC.

Voigt et al. (2000) found that B cells and dendritic cells do
colocalize, albeit aberrantly, even in the absence of CXCR5. In mice
lacking Cxcr5, both cell types were found in a broad ring around the
sinuses of the marginal zones. Voigt et al. (2000) concluded that in
Cxcr5-deficient mice, the organization of splenic primary follicles is
severely impaired. However, within the T cell zone a microenvironment is
built up, which provides all requirements needed for the affinity
maturation to take place.

Prinz et al. (2003) found that in mice deficient in Cxcr5 the follicular
dendritic cells (FDCs) are juxtaposed to major splenic nerves and the
transfer of intraperitoneally-administered prions (see 176640) into the
spinal cord is accelerated. Neuroinvasion velocity correlated
exclusively with the relative locations of FDCs and nerves; transfer of
Cxcr5 -/- bone marrow to wildtype mice induced perineural FDCs and
enhanced neuroinvasion, whereas reciprocal transfer to Cxcr5 -/- mice
abolished them and restored normal efficiency of neuroinvasion.
Suppression of lymphotoxin signaling depleted FDCs, abolished splenic
infectivity, and suppressed acceleration of pathogenesis in Cxcr5 -/-
mice. Prinz et al. (2003) concluded that their data suggests that prion
neuroimmune transition occurs between FDCs and sympathetic nerves, and
relative positioning of FDCs and nerves controls the efficiency of
peripheral prion infection.

602284	TITLE *602284 BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 8B; BMP8B
;;BMP8;;
OSTEOGENIC PROTEIN 2; OP2
DESCRIPTION The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a family of secreted
signaling molecules that can induce ectopic bone growth. Many BMPs,
including BMP8B, are part of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB)
superfamily (see 190180) (Ozkaynak et al., 1992).

CLONING

Using a mouse Op2 probe, Ozkaynak et al. (1992) isolated a novel BMP
cDNA, which they designated OP2, from a human hippocampus library. The
predicted 402-amino acid OP2 protein is processed into a 139-amino acid
mature form. In the TGFB domain, OP2 shows 74% amino acid sequence
identity to OP1 (BMP7; 112267), and 55 to 74% identity to other BMPs. In
mice, Northern blot analysis revealed high levels of Op2 mRNA as 3- and
5-kb transcripts in early embryos, but no detectable levels in any
organs studied.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Whittle et al. (2012) detected variable Bmp8b
expression in all mouse tissues examined, with high expression in testis
and brown adipose tissue, much lower expression in brain and
subcutaneous white adipose tissue, and very low expression in gonadal
white adipose tissue, liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, DiLeone et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse Bmp8 gene to chromosome 4. Based on homology of synteny, they
mapped the human gene to 1p35-p32.

Hartz (2012) mapped the BMP8B gene to chromosome 1p34.2 based on an
alignment of the BMP8B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC023526) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Whittle et al. (2012) found that expression of Bmp8b in mice was
upregulated by refeeding after fasting and by activation of thermogenic
responses. Reporter gene assays revealed that the Bmp8b promoter could
be induced by thermogenic thyroid hormone receptor beta-1 (THRB; 190160)
and by PPAR-alpha (PPARA; 170998) or PPAR-gamma (PPARG; 601487).
Treatment of mouse brown adipocytes with recombinant human BMP8B
increased Smad (see 601595) phosphorylation and activation of
hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE; 151750) and AMPK (see 602739). BMP8B
increased the lipolytic response to norepinephrine, and inhibition of
Alk7 (ACVR1C; 608981) antagonized this effect.

ANIMAL MODEL

Whittle et al. (2012) reported that Bmp8b -/- mice were viable and
healthy but infertile due to defective primordial germ cell formation. A
significant number of Bmp8b -/- pups suffered early death, but survival
increased in a warm environment. Bmp8b -/- mice were prone to weight
gain, particularly on a high fat diet, and they showed reduced core body
temperature and impaired adrenergic-dependent thermogenic capacity.
Intracerebroventricular treatment of Bmp8b -/- mice with recombinant
human BMP8B resulted in marked weight loss and increased core body
temperature. The central thermogenic action of BMP8B was dependent upon
activation levels of hypothalamic Ampk. Whittle et al. (2012) concluded
that BMP8B has a fundamental role in energy balance regulation in both
the hypothalamus and brown adipose tissue.

602204	TITLE *602204 BICAUDAL D, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; BICD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

From the early part of the 20th century, embryologists recognized that
the cytoplasmic asymmetry established in the egg during oogenesis
directs the proper spatial development of the embryo. Development of
this polarity in the Drosophila oocyte depends also on the correct
sorting of maternal RNAs. Bicaudal D is a Drosophila protein that is
involved in establishing the asymmetric cytoplasm in the developing
oocyte. The gene encodes a cytoskeleton-like coiled-coil polypeptide,
with a leucine zipper and 5 alpha-helix domains or heptad repeats
showing sequence similarity to the tail domains of myosin heavy chains
(e.g., 160730), the microtubule motor kinesin (see 600025), and
intermediate filament proteins. Baens et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA
fragment homologous to bicaudal D using a hybridization selection
procedure with cosmids derived from 12p. A PCR-mediated cDNA cloning
strategy was applied by Baens and Marynen (1997) to obtain the coding
sequence of the human homolog (BICD1) and to generate a partial mouse
gene cDNA. They found that predicted amino acid sequence similarity of
the BICD1 cDNA was limited essentially to the amphipatic helices and the
leucine zipper, but the conserved order of these domains suggested a
function of the protein in mammals similar to that in Drosophila. A
database search further indicated the existence of a second human
homolog on 9q and a Caenorhabditis elegans homolog. Northern blot
analysis indicated that both the human and the murine homologs produce
an mRNA species of approximately 9.5 kb expressed in brain, heart, and
skeletal muscle, as well as during mouse embryonic development. The
conserved structural characteristics of BICD1 protein and its expression
in muscle and especially brain suggested to Baens and Marynen (1997)
that BICD1 is a component of a cytoskeleton-based mRNA sorting mechanism
conserved during evolution.

GENE FUNCTION

Bullock and Ish-Horowicz (2001) demonstrated in Drosophila that the same
machinery and RNA signals drive specific accumulation of maternal RNAs
in the early oocyte and apical transcript localization in blastoderm
embryos. They demonstrated in vivo that Egalitarian (Egl) and bicaudal D
(BicD), maternal proteins required for oocyte determination, are
selectively recruited by, and cotransported with, localizing transcripts
in blastoderm embryos, and that interfering with the activities of Egl
and BICD blocks apical localization.

the BICD1 gene and leukocyte telomere length in humans, see 609113.

612897	TITLE *612897 SEPTIN 1; SEPT1
;;DIFF6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nottenburg et al. (1990) cloned mouse Sept1, which they called Diff6.
The deduced protein has a putative leucine zipper and a calculated
molecular mass of 43.5 kD.

Using full-length Aurora B kinase (AURKB; 604970) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a fetal liver cDNA library, Qi et al. (2005) cloned
human SEPT1. SEPT1 belongs to a conserved family of GTPases.
Fluorescence-tagged SEPT1 localized to the midbody of HeLa cells during
cytokinesis, but it remained at the centrosomes and nearby microtubule
region throughout mitosis. It colocalized with Aurora B during
cytokinesis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation of
epitope-tagged proteins, Qi et al. (2005) confirmed that SEPT1
interacted with Aurora B. Aurora B phosphorylated SEPT1 on ser248,
ser307, and ser315 in vitro.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the SEPT1 gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the SEPT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC012161) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

606467	TITLE *606467 ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 8 FAMILY, MEMBER A1; ALDH8A1
;;ALDH12
DESCRIPTION Retinal dehydrogenase isozymes (e.g., RALDH1; 100640) are members of the
ALDH family. Short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases convert all-trans- and
9-cis-retinol to all-trans- and 9-cis-retinal, while RALDH isozymes
convert these into all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid,
respectively.

CLONING

By biochemical purification of rat kidney and liver Raldh isozymes,
micropeptide sequencing, and genomic database analysis, followed by
5-prime and 3-prime RACE and PCR of a human kidney cDNA library, Lin and
Napoli (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding ALDH8A1, which they termed
ALDH12. Sequence analysis predicted that the 487-amino acid ALDH8A1
protein contains the 23 invariant residues and 4 conserved regions
typical of the ALDH superfamily. It also has a cofactor-binding motif
and a cys residue that serves as an active-site nucleophile. Northern
blot analysis revealed expression of a 2.5-kb ALDH8A1 transcript only in
liver and kidney. Dot-blot analysis detected low expression in brain and
spinal cord and detectable expression in mammary gland, thymus, adrenal,
testis, prostate, and parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Functional
analysis showed increased RALDH activity of ALDH8A1, with greater
efficiency for 9-cis-retinal, from pH7 to pH9 in vitro and in intact
cells in the presence of type-1 cis-retinol androgen dehydrogenase
(CRAD1). Lin and Napoli (2000) also identified an ALDH8A1 splice variant
missing 1 exon and encoding a 433-amino acid protein that lacks 2 of the
invariant residues, including the active-site nucleophile.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ALDH8A1
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP sts-N70701).

603071	TITLE *603071 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 17; GPR17
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily contain 7
transmembrane domains and transduce extracellular signals through
heterotrimeric G proteins. By PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides
based on regions conserved between IL8RA (146929) and the angiotensin II
chemokine GPCR (106165), Raport et al. (1996) isolated the GPR17 gene,
which they called R12. Independently, Blasius et al. (1998) used RT-PCR
to identify novel P2 nucleotide (P2Y) GPCRs (see 601167) and isolated
GPR17 cDNAs. They identified 2 GPR17 splice variants, designated HIP4
and FB1, which encode predicted proteins of 339 and 367 amino acids,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that human GPR17 is
expressed as 2.3- and 6.3-kb mRNAs exclusively in brain. The 2
transcripts appear to represent alternatively polyadenylated variants.
Based on protein sequence homology and the conservation of certain key
residues, GPR17 appears to be closely related to the P2Y family of
GPCRs. However, Blasius et al. (1998) stated that preliminary functional
data did not support the hypothesis that classical P2Y agonists serve as
ligands for this receptor.

GENE FUNCTION

Ciana et al. (2006) expressed GPR17 in different cell lines and found
that stimulation with both uracil nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes
(CysLTs) resulted in specific and concentration-dependent responses. In
vivo, knockdown of Gpr17 by either CysLT receptor (CYSLTR1; 300201) or
P2Y receptor (e.g., P2RY12; 600515) antagonists or by antisense
technology prevented evolution of brain damage in a rat focal ischemia
model. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of GPR17 in human and rat
organs prone to ischemic damage, including brain, kidney, and heart.
GPR17 appeared to possess 2 distinct binding sites, one for nucleotides
and the other for CysLTs. Ciana et al. (2006) concluded that GPR17 is a
common molecular target that may mediate ischemia and inflammatory
effects induced by nucleotides and CysLTs.

Using mouse cDNAs, Maekawa et al. (2009) showed that Gpr17 downregulated
the function, but not the membrane localization, of the cysteinyl
leukotriene receptor Cyslt1r (CYSLTR1; 300201). Cotransfection of Gpr17
with Cyslt1r suppressed LTD4 binding and inhibited Cyslt1r-mediated Erk
(see MAPK1; 176948) phosphorylation in response to LTD4.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that Gpr17 and Cyslt1r interacted
directly. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed colocalization
of GPR17 and CYSLT1R on the surface of human peripheral blood monocytes.
Silencing of Gpr17 in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages increased
Cyslt1r membrane expression and increased the magnitude and sensitivity
to LTD4-induced calcium flux. Gpr17 deficiency in mice increased
Cyslt1r-mediated vascular permeability in IgE-dependent mast
cell-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. The vascular leak in
Gpr17-deficient mice was markedly and significantly suppressed by
pharmacologic inhibition of Cyslt1r. Maekawa et al. (2009) concluded
that GPR17 functions as a negative regulator of CYSLT1R.

Mouse hypothalamic neurons expressing Agrp (602311) are involved in
feeding behavior. Ren et al. (2012) found that ablation of Foxo1
(136533) specifically in Agrp-positive hypothalamic neurons resulted in
reduced food intake, leanness, improved glucose homeostasis, and
increased sensitivity to leptin and insulin in mice. Quantitative PCR
and microarray analysis showed that Gpr17 was highly expressed in
Agrp-positive mouse neurons and that Gpr17 expression increased during
fasting. Gpr17 expression was decreased in Foxo1-deficient Agrp-positive
neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that Foxo1
bound the Gpr17 promoter. Ren et al. (2012) concluded that
downregulation of Gpr17, at least in part, mediates the anorexigenic
phenotype of Foxo1-deficient Agrp-positive neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Blasius et al. (1998) noted that the organization of the GPR17 gene
differs from that of many other GPCRs in that the ORF is distributed on
2 exons, with an additional exon containing the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Raport et al. (1996) mapped the R12
gene to chromosome 2. Blasius et al. (1998) regionalized the HIP4/FB1
gene to chromosome 2q21 using fluorescence in situ hybridization.

610909	TITLE *610909 MINICHROMOSOME MAINTENANCE COMPLEX-BINDING PROTEIN; MCMBP
;;CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 119; C10ORF119
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA replication is a carefully orchestrated process involving many
proteins that assemble at origins of replication. Among these are the 6
proteins of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex (e.g., MCM2;
116945), which form a hexamer. Each MCM subunit performs an essential
function in initiation and elongation of DNA replication. MCMBP can
replace MCM2 in the MCM complex, thus forming an alternative MCM hexamer
(Sakwe et al., 2007).

CLONING

By purifying MCM6 (601806)- and MCM7 (600592)-containing complexes from
human 293T cells, followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, Sakwe et
al. (2007) identified MCMBP as a 65-kD MCM complex-binding protein. The
640-amino acid MCMBP protein shares limited homology with members of the
MCM family and is highly conserved in multicellular eukaryotes.
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed extensive nuclear localization of
MCMBP in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunofluorescence microscopy and cellular fractionation, Sakwe et
al. (2007) showed that MCMBP bound to chromatin in a manner typical of
MCM proteins, and that MCMBP was preferentially associated with a
cellular origin in G1 but not S phase. In vivo tagging experiments,
coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous MCM proteins in HeLa cells, and
analysis of recombinant MCM complexes in insect cells revealed that
MCMBP formed a hexamer with MCM3 (602693) through MCM7 that excluded
MCM2; conversely, the hexamer of MCM2 through MCM7 excluded MCMBP. MCMBP
also formed a complex with the MCM4 (602638)/MCM6/MCM7 core helicase in
vitro, but, unlike MCM2, MCMBP did not inhibit helicase activity. Sakwe
et al. (2007) concluded that 2 forms of MCM complexes occur, those with
MCM2 and those in which MCMBP replaces MCM2.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MCMBP
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP A005M41).

611911	TITLE *611911 IRON-SULFUR CLUSTER SCAFFOLD, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF; ISCU
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are prosthetic groups found in respiratory
chain complexes and numerous mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes.
Assembly of Fe-S clusters requires scaffold proteins, such as ISCU, as
well as cysteine desulfurases, iron donors, and chaperones (Li et al.,
2006).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of yeast Isu proteins,
followed by 5-prime RACE of heart and liver RNA, Tong and Rouault (2000)
cloned 2 ISCU splice variants, ISCU1 and ISCU2. Both variants share the
same transcription initiation site, but they differ in the presence
(ISCU1) or absence (ISCU2) of exon 1B. ISCU1 encodes a deduced 142-amino
acid protein with 13 unique N-terminal residues, and ISCU2 encodes a
deduced 167-amino acid protein with 38 unique N-terminal residues,
including a mitochondrial targeting signal. They have predicted
molecular masses of 15.4 and 17.9 kD, respectively. Northern blot
analysis with specific probes detected endogenous ISCU1 and ISCU2
transcripts of 1.4 and 1.3 kb, respectively, in heart and RD4
rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Northern blot analysis of a human tissue panel
using a common probe detected a 1.35-kb transcript expressed
predominantly in heart and skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence
microscopy of transfected COS cells showed that ISCU1 localized to
cytosol and nucleus, whereas ISCU2 colocalized with a mitochondrial
marker. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of fractionated
RD4 cells detected an endogenous ISCU1 protein of 15 kD. ISCU2 appeared
to undergo rapid 2-step processing, with proteolytic cleavage at glu27
and then at tyr35, resulting in a mature protein of about 14 kD. A 19-kD
form of cytosolic ISCU was also detected.

GENE STRUCTURE

Olsson et al. (2008) noted that the ISCU gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ISCU
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP D12S1907).

In a study of patients with hereditary myopathy and lactic acidosis
(255125), Mochel et al. (2008) found that the ISCU gene lies in a region
of homozygosity for that disorder on chromosome 12q24.11.

GENE FUNCTION

ISCS (NFS1; 603485) is a cysteine desulfurase thought to sequester
inorganic sulfur for Fe-S cluster assembly. By coimmunoprecipitation and
Western blot analysis of fractionated RD4 cells, Tong and Rouault (2000)
found that the mitochondrial and cytosolic ISCU isoforms associated with
the mitochondrial and cytosolic ISCS isoforms in their respective
fractions, suggesting that separate Fe-S cluster assembly complexes
exist in the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments.

Using isoform-specific small interfering RNA in HeLa cells, Tong and
Rouault (2006) showed that the mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of
ISCU were necessary for the activities of mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2;
100850) and cytosolic aconitase (ACO1; 100880), respectively. In
addition, knockdown of the ISCU isoforms inappropriately activated the
iron regulatory element-binding activities and iron regulatory functions
of ACO1 and IREB2 (147582) and disrupted intracellular iron homeostasis.
Endogenous ISCU levels were depressed by iron deprivation. Tong and
Rouault (2006) concluded that ISCU is involved in a coordinated response
to iron deficiency that includes activation of iron uptake,
redistribution of intracellular iron, and decreased utilization of iron
in Fe-S proteins.

Li et al. (2006) found that the cytosolic isoforms of human ISCS and
ISCU formed a complex in vitro. When incubated with IRP1 (ACO1),
cysteine, and iron, the cytosolic forms of ISCS and ISCU facilitated
formation of a 4Fe-4S cluster on IRP1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

A myopathy with severe exercise intolerance and myoglobinuria (255125)
has been described as an autosomal recessive trait in patients from
northern Sweden, with associated deficiencies of succinate dehydrogenase
and aconitase in skeletal muscle. Mochel et al. (2008) identified the
ISCU gene as a candidate within a region of shared homozygosity on
chromosome 12q in 3 patients from 3 families with this disorder. They
identified a homozygous intronic G-to-C transversion (7044G-C, or
IVS5+382G-C; 611911.0001) in the ISCU gene in all 3 affected
individuals. The mutation strengthened a weak splice acceptor site
within intron 5, leading to retention of a 100-bp intronic sequence and
resulting in 15 amino acids and a premature stop codon. A marked
reduction of ISCU mRNA and mitochondrial ISCU protein in patient muscle
was associated with a decrease in the iron regulatory protein IRP1
(100880) and intracellular iron overload in skeletal muscle, consistent
with a muscle-specific alteration of iron homeostasis in this disorder.
ISCU interacts with the Friedreich ataxia (FRDA; 229300) gene product
frataxin (FXN; 606829) in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis.

In 15 affected members from 9 families with hereditary myopathy and
lactic acidosis, Olsson et al. (2008) independently mapped the locus to
chromosome 12q23.2-q24.11 (maximum lod score of 5.26 at D12S84). They
identified homozygosity for the intronic G-to-C transversion in the ISCU
gene in all affected individuals.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nordin et al. (2011) found that Iscu -/- mice were embryonic lethal. No
homozygous null embryos were identified at embryonic day (E) 7.5 to
10.5, but at E3.5, 2 of 9 embryos were homozygous for the null allele,
suggesting that Iscu is important for the implantation or early
development of the embryo. In contrast, Iscu +/- mice showed no apparent
physical impairment and were similar to the wildtype mice. Tissue from
heterozygous mice showed decreased levels of Iscu protein, but the
reduction was less than 50%, suggesting upregulation of the functional
allele.

ISCU, IVS5, G-C, +382

from northern Sweden, Mochel et al. (2008) found homozygosity for an
intronic G-to-C transversion (7044G-C, or IVS5+382G-C) in the ISCU gene.
There were 3 heterozygous carriers of the mutation among 568 Swedish
chromosomes, resulting in a frequency of approximately 1 in 188 in this
population. Western blot analysis of patient muscle showed a substantial
reduction of the normal mitochondrial isoform (ISCU2) compared to
controls. The mutation was thought to strengthen a weak splicing
acceptor site, with consequent retention of a 100-bp intronic sequence
upstream of the known terminal exon, introduction of a stop codon, and
decreased levels of ISCU mRNA and protein. The depletion of
mitochondrial ISCU in muscle would account for the biochemical and
clinical phenotype, which is characterized by a deficiency in
mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins and impaired muscle oxidative
metabolism.

Independently, Olsson et al. (2008) identified homozygosity the G-to-C
transversion in intron 5 of the ISCU gene in 15 affected members from 9
families with hereditary myopathy and lactic acidosis. RT-PCR studies
showed aberrant splicing of the ISCU mRNA in patient muscle biopsies
compared to controls, with significantly decreased levels of the
mitochondrial ISCU2 isoform. However, patient mRNA did not correspond to
the cytosolic ISCU1 isoform; rather, patient mRNA contained a 100-bp
sequence from intron 5, inserted between exons 4 and 5. This was due to
activation of cryptic acceptor and donor splice sites. The added intron
sequence resulted in an alternative C-terminal 15 amino acids followed
by a stop codon.

Kollberg and Holme (2009) demonstrated that an antisense oligonucleotide
specifically targeting activated cryptic splice sites in the ISCU gene
induced by the 7044G-C mutation was able to restore the correct reading
frame in cultured fibroblasts derived from patients with homozygous
mutation. The restoration in cells was stable, with correctly spliced
mRNA remaining the dominant RNA species after 21 days.

Sanaker et al. (2010) reported a Norwegian woman with the disorder who
was homozygous for the 7044G-C mutation. Activities of mitochondrial
complexes I, II, and III were decreased in skeletal muscle samples,
whereas cultured myoblasts and fibroblasts had nearly normal activity.
Western blot analysis showed decreased ISCU type I in muscle, myoblasts,
and fibroblasts. The steady-state level of ISCU mRNA was significantly
decreased in patient myoblasts (20% of controls), moderately decreased
in muscle (54% of controls), and normal in fibroblasts. The mutant
transcript containing exons 5, 5A, and 6 was the predominant (90%)
species in patient muscle, although low levels (10%) of the normal
transcript with exons 5 and 6 were also found. Control samples had low
levels of the mutant transcript as well, suggesting that the mutation
strengthens a preexisting weak splice site. Patient blood, myoblasts,
and fibroblasts had equal amounts of both transcripts. Patient muscle
also specifically showed an increase in mitochondrial content compared
to controls, perhaps representing a compensatory mechanism. These
findings suggested that the ratio between normally spliced and
abnormally spliced transcript is important in determining tissue
specificity of the defect.

Nordin et al. (2011) demonstrated tissue-specific expression of the
mutant spliced ISCU protein. RT-PCR analysis of postmortem tissue
samples from a patient with the IVS5 mutation showed that the muscle had
the highest relative amount of mutant mRNA (80%), with the transcript
containing the 100-bp insert being the most common. In heart and liver,
the wildtype mRNA predominated, representing 70% total mRNA in heart and
54% in liver. The findings were confirmed by Western blot analysis of
the tissues. The results indicated that tissue-specific differential
splicing underlies the muscle-specific phenotype in patients with this
ISCU mutation.

Nordin et al. (2012) found that the RNA-binding factor IGF2BP1 (608288)
had a higher affinity for mutant ISCU than wildtype ISCU. PTBP1
(600693), implicated in repression of incorrect splicing, bound strongly
to both wildtype and mutant ISCU. In vitro studies using an ISCU
minigene showed that PTBP1 dramatically repressed incorrect splicing
when coexpressed with the mutant minigene, resulting in a 0.13-fold
change of the mutant:normal transcript ratio. In contrast, IGF2B1 and
RBM39 (604739) resulted in an increased mutant:normal transcript ratio
and were able to counteract the effect of PTBP1. Nordin et al. (2012)
suggested that IGF2BP1 in particular may be a factor that promotes the
inclusion of the pseudoexon in mutant ISCU by interfering with PTBP1
binding and repression of mutant ISCU.

MYOPATHY WITH LACTIC ACIDOSIS, HEREDITARY
ISCU, GLY50GLU

(255125), Kollberg et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for
the common intronic G-to-C mutation (611911.0001) and a 149G-A
transition in exon 3 of the ISCU gene, resulting in a gly50-to-glu
(G50E) substitution. The G50E mutation was inherited from their
unaffected Finnish mother and was not found in 100 Finnish controls.
Western blot analysis of skeletal muscle mitochondria showed only
slightly reduced levels of ISCU protein in the 2 brothers, suggesting
that the missense mutation gives rise to a nonfunctional protein. The
boys had a more severe phenotype than patients homozygous for the
intronic 7044G-C mutation. The brothers had progressive and severe
muscle weakness and muscle wasting beginning at age 2 years. They also
showed evidence of cardiac involvement, with EKG changes and mild
cardiac hypertrophy without dilatation. Kollberg et al. (2009) noted
that the boys did not complain of exercise intolerance, and suggested
that they were too weak to even elicit symptoms such as tachycardia,
palpitations, or shortness of breath.

607698	TITLE *607698 LIGAND-DEPENDENT NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COREPRESSOR; LCOR
;;MBLK1-RELATED PROTEIN 2; MLR2;;
KIAA1795
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LCOR is a transcriptional corepressor widely expressed in fetal and
adult tissues that is recruited to agonist-bound nuclear receptors
through a single LxxLL motif, also referred to as a nuclear receptor
(NR) box (Fernandes et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned LCOR, which they called KIAA1795.
The deduced KIAA1795 protein contains 572 amino acids. RT-PCR followed
by ELISA detected highest expression in liver, testis, and ovary,
followed by kidney and brain. Within brain, highest expression was
detected in amygdala, corpus callosum, and caudate nucleus.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a fetal kidney cDNA library using the
ligand-binding domain of ESR1 (133430) as bait, followed by screening a
prostate cDNA library and searching EST databases, Fernandes et al.
(2003) cloned LCOR. The predicted 433-amino acid LCOR protein has a
calculated molecular mass of approximately 47 kD. It contains an LxxLL
motif, a nuclear localization signal, and a helix-loop-helix domain.
Northern blot analysis detected broad expression of LCOR transcripts at
varying levels in human adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression
in placenta, cerebellum and corpus callosum of brain, adult kidney, and
a number of fetal tissues.

Kunieda et al. (2003) cloned mouse Lcor, which they called Mlr2, based
on its homology with the honeybee transcription factor Mblk1. The
deduced 433-amino acid protein contains a DNA-binding motif and a motif
conserved in Mlr1 (LCORL; 611799). Northern blot analysis detected
expression of Mlr2 in mouse kidney, liver, and heart, with weak
expression in brain and no expression in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Fernandes et al. (2003) determined that binding of LCOR to ESR1 depends
in part on residues in the coactivator-binding pocket of ESR1 distinct
from those bound by TIF2 (601993). Repression by LCOR could be abolished
by histone deacetylase (HDAC; see 601241) inhibitor trichostatin A in a
receptor-dependent fashion, indicating HDAC-dependent and -independent
modes of action. LCOR bound directly to specific HDACs in vitro and in
vivo. Moreover, LCOR was shown to function by recruiting
C-terminal-binding protein (CTBP; see 602618) corepressors through 2
consensus binding motifs and to colocalize with CTBPs in the nucleus.
Fernandes et al. (2003) concluded that LCOR represents a class of
corepressor that attenuates agonist-activated nuclear receptor signaling
by multiple mechanisms.

Using a reporter gene assay, Kunieda et al. (2003) showed that mouse
Mlr2 bound and activated transcription from the DNA element recognized
by honeybee Mblk1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fernandes et al. (2003) determined that the LCOR gene contains 7 exons,
including 4 short 5-prime untranslated region exons that contain several
in-frame stop codons.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the LCOR gene to chromosome 10 by radiation
hybrid analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Fernandes et al. (2003)
mapped the LCOR gene to chromosome 10q24.1.

148070	TITLE *148070 KERATIN 18; KRT18
;;K18;;
CYTOKERATIN 18; CYK18
DESCRIPTION Intermediate filaments (IFs) are a structurally related family of
cellular proteins that appear to be intimately involved with the
cytoskeleton. The common structural motif shared by all IFs is a central
alpha-helical 'rod domain' flanked by variable N- and C-terminal
domains. The rod domain, the canonical feature of IFs, has been highly
conserved during evolution. The variable terminals, however, have
allowed the known IFs to be classified into 6 distinct types by virtue
of their differing amino acid sequences (Steinert and Roop, 1988).
Keratins compose types I and II; intermediate filaments desmin,
vimentin, GFAP, and peripherin, type III; neurofilaments, type IV, and
nuclear lamins, type V. Nestin (600915) has been classed as type VI
(Lendahl et al., 1990). The acidic keratins are coded by genes KRT9
(607606) to KRT19 (148020). These genes are located on mouse chromosome
11 and human chromosome 17, except for KRT18 which may be located on
human chromosome 12 (see later). The basic keratins are coded by genes
KRT1 (139350) to KRT8 (148060), which are located on mouse chromosome 15
and human chromosome 12.

Human keratin 18 and the homologous mouse Endo B are type I IF protein
subunits whose expression is restricted in adults to a variety of simple
epithelial tissues. Endo B and its coexpressed type II keratin, Endo A
(the mouse equivalent of human keratin 8), appear to be the first IF
proteins expressed during murine development. Type I and type II
keratins are usually expressed as preferential pairs in equal
proportions in cells, although filaments can be formed in vitro from
heterologous IF subunits. KRT18 is the most divergent of the type I
keratins with N-terminal and C-terminal domains that are quite different
from those of epidermal keratins. According to Kulesh and Oshima (1989),
the genes that code for 12 diverse IF proteins had been cloned and
characterized. Kulesh and Oshima (1989) isolated the human KRT18 gene as
a 10-kb fragment of genomic DNA. Following transfection, the gene was
expressed in several different mouse cell lines including nonepithelial
cells that do not express the homologous endogenous Endo-B gene. The
KRT18 gene is 3,791 bp long and the keratin 18 protein is coded for by 7
exons. The exon structure of KRT18 has been conserved compared to that
of other keratin genes, with the exception of a single 3-prime terminal
exon that codes for the tail domain of the protein that is represented
by 2 exons in epidermal keratins. Waseem et al. (1990) used
human-specific primers from within introns of the published gene
sequence for human type I keratin 18 and PCR to amplify this gene
specifically. By Southern blotting using the genomic DNA PCR product,
they assigned the gene for keratin 18 to chromosome 12. Other human type
I keratins have been assigned to chromosome 17. Waseem et al. (1990)
suggested that the findings indicate the early divergence of the genes
for stratifying cell keratins from that of simple, or embryonic, keratin
18.

By in situ hybridization, Heath et al. (1990) localized a human
cytokeratin 18 cDNA sequence to 17p12-p11. They presented the findings
as evidence for a clustering of cytokeratin genes and related sequences
on the p and q arms of chromosome 17. The findings are, however,
inconsistent with those of Waseem et al. (1990).

By analysis of a YAC contig from 12q13, Yoon et al. (1994) demonstrated
that the KRT18 type I keratin gene is located next to its type II
partner, KRT8, in a cluster of type II keratin genes.

Ku et al. (1995) described transgenic mice that express point-mutant K18
and develop chronic hepatitis and hepatocyte fragility in association
with disruption of hepatocyte keratin filaments. They showed that
transgenic mice expressing mutant K18 are highly susceptible to
hepatotoxicity after acute administration of acetaminophen or chronic
ingestion of griseofulvin. The authors concluded that the predisposition
to hepatotoxicity results directly from the keratin mutation since
nontransgenic or transgenic mice that express normal human K18 are more
resistant. Hepatotoxicity was manifested by a significant difference in
lethality, liver histopathology, and biochemical serum testing. Keratin
glycosylation decreased in all griseofulvin-fed mice, whereas keratin
phosphorylation increased dramatically preferentially in mice expressing
normal K18. The phosphorylation increase in normal K18 after
griseofulvin feeding appeared to involve sites that are different from
those that increased after partial hepatectomy. Ku et al. (1996) stated
that this dramatic phosphorylation increase in nonmutant keratins could
provide survival advantage to hepatocytes. Although the potential for
K18 mutations to cause human disease remain to be investigated, they
considered it possible that K8/18 mutations may not directly cause
disease but may predispose to it; for example, mutations may confer
susceptibility to liver disease upon exposure to an environmental factor
such as a virus or hepatotoxin.

Although mutations had been described in 11 of the more than 20 keratin
intermediate filaments (as the basis of epidermal and oral disorders),
no disease-associated mutations had been described in keratin 8 (KRT8;
148060) or KRT18 until the report by Ku et al. (1997). K8/18 is the
major keratin pair in epithelia of the type found in liver, pancreas,
and intestine. Transgenic mice that express mutant keratin 18, as
already noted, develop chronic hepatitis, and have an increased
susceptibility to drug-induced hepatotoxicity. By studying patients with
liver disease of unknown cause for mutations in KRT18, Ku et al. (1997)
described a his127leu (H127L) KRT mutation in a patient with cryptogenic
cirrhosis (see 215600) that was germline transmitted (148070.0001). The
mutant KRT18 isolated from the liver explant, or after expression in
bacteria, showed an altered migration on 2-dimensional gel analysis as
compared with normal human liver or bacterially expressed KRT18.
Electron microscopy of in vitro assembled mutant KRT18 and wildtype KRT8
showed an assembly defect as compared with normal KRT8/18 assembly. The
results suggested that mutations in KRT18 predispose to cryptogenic
cirrhosis in humans.

Among 120 patients with cirrhosis of undetermined cause (see 215600), Ku
et al. (1997) found 1 patient with a heterozygous A-to-T transversion in
the KRT18 gene that resulted in a his127-to-leu substitution. The
mutation was germline since sequencing of amplified genomic DNA,
isolated from a blood sample of the daughter of the patient, showed the
same H127L mutation in heterozygous form.

Ku et al. (2003) found a his127-to-leu mutation in noncryptogenic
cirrhosis and concluded that the mutation functions as a susceptibility
gene.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ron and Habener (1992) cloned mouse Ddit3, which they called Chop.
Antisera raised against Chop recognized a nuclear protein with a
molecular mass of 29 kD.

Park et al. (1992) isolated the DDIT3 gene, which they called GADD153,
from human cells. The DDIT3 gene shows a high level of conservation in
both the structural and regulatory regions to the previously described
hamster gene. The human and hamster proteins share 91% amino acid
identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Ron and Habener (1992) showed that CHOP serves as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of the transcription factors C/EBP (116897, 116898) and LAP
(189965). They found that bacterially expressed CHOP inhibited the
DNA-binding activity of C/EBP and LAP by forming heterodimers that could
not bind DNA.

Using differential expression and immunohistochemical analyses of benign
nevi and melanomas of different levels, Korabiowska et al. (1997)
observed p53 (TP53; 191170) negativity and high expression of GADD34
(PPP1R15A; 611048), GADD45 (GADD45A; 126335), and GADD153 in all nevi.
However, in melanomas, p53 expression increased and GADD expression
decreased with the Clark level of melanoma thickness. Patient survival
time correlated negatively with p53 positivity and positively with
GADD45 and GADD153 expression. Korabiowska et al. (1997) concluded that
GADD proteins play an important role in the malignant transformation of
nevus to melanoma.

CHOP is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress imposed by
unfolded and malfolded proteins. By transcriptional profiling, Marciniak
et al. (2004) compared gene expression in unstressed and ER-stressed
wildtype and Chop -/- primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. They found that
Chop directly activated Gadd34, which promoted ER protein biosynthesis
by dephosphorylating Eif2-alpha (EIF2S1; 603907) in stressed cells,
causing accumulation of high molecular mass protein complexes in the
stressed ER. Chop also activated Ero1-alpha (ERO1L; 615435), which
encodes an ER oxidase. Consequently, the ER of stressed Chop -/- cells
was hypooxidized relative to the ER of stressed wildtype cells.
Pharmacologic and genetic manipulations promoting a hypooxidized ER
reduced abnormal high molecular mass protein complexes and protected
cells from the lethal consequences of ER stress. Marciniak et al. (2004)
concluded that Chop deletion protected cells from ER stress by
decreasing ER protein load and changing redox conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Park et al. (1992) determined that the human and hamster DDIT3 genes
both contain 4 exons, with the intron/exon junctions maintained at
identical positions.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization, Park et al.
(1992) mapped the DDIT3 gene to chromosome 12q13.1-q13.2.

CYTOGENETICS

CHOP is consistently rearranged in myxoid liposarcomas (613488) (Aman et
al., 1992). In the characteristic chromosomal translocation
t(12;16)(q13;p11), Crozat et al. (1993) showed that the CHOP gene is
fused with a gene on chromosome 16 provisionally designated TLS
(translocated in liposarcoma). The same gene was called FUS by Rabbitts
et al. (1993); see 137070. The TLS gene was found to be a novel nuclear
RNA-binding protein with extensive sequence similarity to EWS (133450),
the product of a gene commonly translocated in Ewing sarcoma (612219).
In TLS-CHOP, the RNA-binding domain of TLS is replaced by the
DNA-binding and leucine zipper dimerization domain of CHOP. Targeting of
a conserved effector domain of RNA-binding proteins to DNA may play a
role in tumor formation.

In an analysis of peripheral blood samples from 19 patients with myxoid
liposarcoma due to t(12;16) and in 1 patient with myxoid liposarcoma due
to t(12;22;20), resulting in the fusion of the CHOP and EWS genes,
Panagopoulos et al. (1996) found FUS/CHOP hybrid fragments in 3 patients
with t(12;16) and a EWS/CHOP hybrid in the patient with the latter
translocation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Endo et al. (2006) found that mice challenged intratracheally with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed Chop and Bip (HSPA5; 138120).
Compared with wildtype mice, mice lacking Chop showed reduced lung
inflammation in response to LPS, diminished Il1b (147720) activity, and
suppression of Casp11 (SFRS2IP; 603668) induction in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid. Inflammation of lung in response to Il1b was not
attenuated in Chop-deficient mice. Endo et al. (2006) concluded that
CHOP is critical in LPS-induced lung injury and in induction of CASP11,
which mediates activation of pro-CASP1 (147678) and pro-IL1B.

607982	TITLE *607982 SCY1-LIKE 1; SCYL1
;;N-TERMINAL KINASE-LIKE; NTKL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Liu et al. (2000) cloned mouse Scyl1, which they called p105, from an
adipocyte cell line cDNA library. The deduced 806-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of about 89 kD. Scyl1 shares significant
sequence similarity with kinases, but its putative kinase domain lacks
subdomain 1 of the 12 characteristic subdomains, and it is missing
highly conserved residues in other subdomains, suggesting that Scyl1 is
not a functional kinase. Western blot analysis of mouse tissues found
that Scyl1 has an apparent molecular mass of about 105 kD and is present
in all tissues examined. Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions
indicated that mouse Scyl1 is primarily cytosolic and that it is present
in low density microsomes.

By large-scale sequencing of a mammary gland cDNA library, followed by
nested PCR and 5-prime RACE, Kato et al. (2002) cloned SCYL1, which they
called NTKL. The deduced 808-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 89.6 kD. Kato et al. (2002) also cloned 2 splice
variants that harbor internal deletions and encode proteins of 791 and
707 amino acids, which they termed variant 1 and variant 2,
respectively. NTKL has an N-terminal kinase-like domain and a C-terminal
cluster of basic amino acids. NTKL shares 90% amino acid identity with
mouse Ntkl, and like mouse Ntkl, it does not contain kinase subdomain 1.
NTKL also shares sequence similarity with the S. cerevisiae Scy1
protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.8-kb transcript in all
tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Using NTKL carrying 2 different epitope tags, Kato et al. (2002) found
that NTKL forms multimers following transfection into COS-7 cells. They
determined that NTKL forms a 300-kD trimer using crosslinking reagents.
Biochemical analysis revealed no phosphorylation or autophosphorylation
activity. Kato et al. (2002) found that the 707-amino acid NTKL variant,
variant 2, localized to centrosomes during mitosis. During interphase,
fluorescence-tagged variant 2 localized in the cytoplasm as well as
centrosomes. However, at the beginning of mitosis, the fluorescence
appeared as a pair of bright nuclear foci that followed centrosome
localization throughout mitosis, while maintaining diffuse cytoplasmic
labeling. Endogenous variant 2 in HeLa cells showed a similar staining
pattern. Centrosomal localization was independent of microtubules.

Di et al. (2003) identified an Ntkl-binding protein (GORAB; 607983) in
mouse that colocalized with Ntkl in cytoplasm and showed ubiquitous
expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kato et al. (2002) determined that the SCYL1 gene contains 18 exons and
spans about 15 kb. Alternative splicing produces variant 1, which lacks
half of exon 14, and variant 2, which lacks most of exon 14, all of exon
15, and half of exon 16.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2000) and Kato et al. (2002)
mapped the SCYL1 gene to chromosome 11q13.

607758	TITLE *607758 CATENIN, BETA-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; CTNNBIP1
;;INHIBITOR OF BETA-CATENIN AND TCF4; ICAT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tago et al. (2000) cloned mouse Ctnnbip1, which they designated Icat.
Western blot analysis showed that the deduced 81-amino acid protein has
an apparent molecular mass of 9.0 kD. Tago et al. (2000) also identified
an EST clone for human ICAT. The deduced mouse and human proteins are
identical except for 2 amino acid changes. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected a 2.6-kb transcript expressed at high levels in
heart, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, at low levels in kidney,
testis, and lung, and at undetectable levels in spleen. Icat was also
expressed at fairly constant levels during embryonic mouse development.

GENE FUNCTION

Tago et al. (2000) determined that mouse Icat interacts with
beta-catenin (116806) in vitro and in vivo. By mutation analysis, they
determined that the central region of Icat, specifically glu37, glu38,
and glu39, interacts with armadillo repeats 10 through 12 of
beta-catenin. Icat inhibited the interaction of beta-catenin with Tcf4
(TCF7L2; 602228) and repressed beta-catenin-Tcf4-mediated
transactivation. Icat inhibited Xenopus axis formation by interfering
with Wnt (see 164820) signaling. Tago et al. (2000) concluded that Icat
negatively regulates Wnt signaling via inhibition of the interaction
between beta-catenin and Tcf, and that Icat is required for development
and cell proliferation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Graham et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure at 2.5-angstrom
resolution of a complex between CTNNB1 and ICAT, a protein that prevents
interaction between CTNNB1 and TCF/LEF family transcription factors.
ICAT contains a 3-helix bundle that binds armadillo repeats 10 to 12 and
a C-terminal tail that, like TCF and E-cadherin (192090), binds in the
groove formed by armadillo repeats 5 to 9 of CTNNB1. Graham et al.
(2002) showed that ICAT selectively inhibits CTNNB1/TCF binding in vivo,
without disrupting CTNNB1/cadherin interactions. They concluded that it
should be possible to design cancer therapeutics that inhibit
CTNNB1-mediated transcriptional activation without interfering with cell
adhesion.

Daniels and Weis (2002) determined the crystal structure of ICAT bound
to the armadillo repeat domain of CTNNB1. ICAT contains an N-terminal
helical domain that binds to repeats 11 and 12 of CTNNB1, and an
extended C-terminal region that binds to repeats 5 to 10 in a manner
similar to that of TCFs and other CTNNB1 ligands.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
CTNNBIP1 gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG2532).

604982	TITLE *604982 HPS1 GENE; HPS1
;;PALE EAR, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Oh et al. (1996) identified the HPS1 gene by positional cloning. The
HPS1 gene encodes a novel transmembrane protein that is thought to be a
component of multiple cytoplasmic organelles and is apparently crucial
for their normal development and function.

Wildenberg et al. (1998) demonstrated an apparent alternative transcript
of the HPS1 gene. By RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, 2 polyadenylated
transcripts were found in normal human melanocytes, human bone marrow
cells, human melanoma cells, lymphoblastoid cell lines, and
megakaryocytic leukemia cells. Thus, the HPS1 gene is complex and may
have more than 1 biologically active transcript. Wildenberg et al.
(1998) noted that the same type of alternative splicing occurs in the
IGHM gene (147020), resulting in membrane-bound and secreted protein
products.

GENE FUNCTION

Martina et al. (2003) determined that HPS1 and HPS4 (606682) form a
lysosomal complex that they termed BLOC3 (biogenesis of lysosome-related
organelles complex-3). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated
that epitope-tagged and endogenous HPS1 and HPS4 proteins assembled with
each other in vivo. The complex was predominantly cytosolic, with a
small amount peripherally associated with membranes. Size exclusion
chromatography and sedimentation velocity analysis of the cytosolic
fraction indicated that HPS1 and HPS4 formed a moderately asymmetric
complex with a molecular mass of about 175 kD. Hps4-deficient
fibroblasts from light ear mice displayed normal distribution and
trafficking of a lysosomal protein and an apparently normal accumulation
of Zn(2+) in intracellular vesicles. In contrast, fibroblasts of AP3
(see AP3B1; 603401)-deficient pearl mice showed deficits in both of
these measures. Martina et al. (2003) concluded that HPS1 and HPS4 are
components of a cytosolic complex that is involved in the biogenesis of
lysosomal-related organelles through a mechanism distinct from that
operated by the AP3 complex.

MAPPING

Fukai et al. (1995) used the linkage disequilibrium mapping approach to
localize the HPS1 locus in 2 groups in whom the Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (203300) is particularly frequent: a group in Puerto Rico and a
group in an isolated village in the Swiss Alps. They localized the HPS1
locus in both groups to a 0.6-cM interval in chromosome segment
10q23.1-q23.2. Wildenberg et al. (1995) likewise mapped the HPS1 locus
to 10q. They collected blood samples from a relatively homogeneous
population in Puerto Rico, where Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome has a
frequency of about 1 in 1,800, giving a carrier frequency estimated to
be 1 in 21. Analysis of pooled DNA samples allowed them to screen the
genome rapidly for candidate loci and identify linkage with a marker on
10q. The result was verified with additional markers, and a maximum lod
score of 5.07 at theta = 0.001 was calculated for marker D10S198.
Haplotype analysis placed the HPS1 locus in a region of approximately 1
cM that contains the markers D10S198 and D10S1239.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Oh et al. (1996) identified homozygous frameshifts in the HPS1 gene in
Puerto Rican, Swiss, Irish, and Japanese HPS patients.

Oh et al. (1998) performed mutation analysis on 44 unrelated Puerto
Rican and 24 unrelated non-Puerto Rican HPS patients. A 16-bp frameshift
duplication (604982.0001), the result of an apparent founder effect, was
nearly ubiquitous among Puerto Rican patients. A frameshift at codon 322
may be the most frequent HPS mutation in Europeans. The mutation in
these cases was a 1-bp insertion (or duplication) in a poly(C) tract at
codons 322 to 324. Oh et al. (1998) also described 6 novel HPS1
mutations: a 5-prime splice-junction mutation of IVS5, 3 frameshifts, a
nonsense mutation, and a 1-codon in-frame deletion. These mutations
defined an apparent frameshift hotspot at codons 321-322. Overall,
however, they detected mutations in the HPS1 gene in only about half of
non-Puerto Rican patients, and presented evidence suggesting locus
heterogeneity for HPS.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The different clinical HPS phenotypes associated with different HPS1
frameshifts suggested to Oh et al. (1996) that differentially truncated
HPS1 polypeptides may have somewhat different consequences for
subcellular function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Two genetically distinct mouse loci, 'pale ear' (ep) and 'ruby-eye'
(ru), both with mutant phenotypes similar to human Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome, map close together in the homologous region of murine
chromosome 19, which suggested that one of these loci might be
homologous to human HPS. Feng et al. (1997) characterized the mouse Hps
cDNA and genomic locus, and identified pathologic Hps gene mutations in
ep but not in ru mice, establishing mouse 'pale ear' as an animal model
for human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. The phenotype of homozygous ep
mutant mice encompasses those of both Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and
Chediak-Higashi syndrome, suggesting that these disorders may be closely
related. In addition, the mouse and human HPS genes both contain a rare
'AT-AC' intron (i.e., an intron with nonconsensus splice sites), and
comparison of the sequences of this intron in the mouse and human genes
identified conserved sequences that suggest a possible role for pre-mRNA
secondary structure in excision of this rare class of introns. (See
601428 and 601429 for a discussion of small nuclear RNAs necessary for
AT-AC intron splicing, and see Hall and Padgett (1994) for a discussion
of introns with nonconsensus splice sites.)

To test for in vivo interactions between the HPS1 and HPS2 genes in the
production and function of intracellular organelles, Feng et al. (2002)
created mice doubly heterozygous for the 2 mutant genes by appropriate
breeding. Cooperation between the 2 genes in melanosome production was
evident in increased hypopigmentation of the coat together with dramatic
quantitative and qualitative alterations of melanosomes of the retinal
pigment epithelium and choroid of double-mutant mice. Lysosomal and
platelet dense granule abnormalities, including hyposecretion of
lysosomal enzymes from kidneys and depression of serotonin
concentrations of platelet dense granules were likewise more severe in
double than in single mutants. Also, lysosomal enzyme concentrations
were significantly increased in lungs of double-mutant mice. Interaction
between the 2 genes was specific in that effects on organelles were
confined to melanosomes, lysosomes, and platelet dense granules.
Together, the evidence indicated that these 2 HPS genes function largely
independently at the whole-organism level to affect the production and
function of all 3 organelles. Furthermore, the increased lysosomal
enzyme levels in lung of double-mutant mice suggested a cause of a major
clinical problem of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, lung fibrosis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 16-BP DUP

By SSCP/heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencing, Oh et al. (1996) found
that 22 Puerto Rican patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300)
were homozygous for a 16-bp duplication within exon 15 of the HPS gene,
resulting in a frameshift distal to codon pro496, with termination of
the nonsense polypeptide at codon 586. Similarly, all 11 obligate
heterozygotes tested were heterozygous, whereas they did not observe
this mutation in 5 Puerto Rican or 15 Asian controls, or in 11
non-Puerto Rican Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome patients. Although
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is frequent on the island of Puerto Rico, it
has not been reported elsewhere in the Caribbean. Apparent homogeneity
of the 16-bp frameshift duplication among Puerto Rican Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome patients suggests that this mutation arose in Puerto Rico
during its early population or colonization and that the frequency of
the mutation was amplified as a founder effect due to occult inbreeding
and genetic drift. The mutation was easily identified, even by simple
agarose electrophoresis of the exon 15 PCR product, which appears
abnormally large; furthermore, heterozygotes additionally exhibit a
prominent aberrant heteroduplex band. Thus, diagnosis, prenatal
diagnosis, and carrier testing for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in the
Puerto Rican population, in which the expected frequency of heterozygote
may be as high as 1 in 21 persons, is possible.

All identified patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome in northwest
Puerto Rico were found to be homozygous for the 16-bp duplication in
exon 15 of the HPS gene. Gahl et al. (1998) compared the clinical and
laboratory characteristics of these patients with those of patients
without the 16-bp duplication. They studied 49 patients: 27 Puerto
Ricans and 22 patients from mainland United States who were not of
Puerto Rican descent. The diagnosis was based on the presence of
albinism and the absence of platelet dense bodies. Homozygosity for the
16-bp duplication was found in 25 of the 27 Puerto Rican patients,
whereas none of the non-Puerto Rican patients carried this mutation.
Like the patients without the duplication, the patients with the 16-bp
duplication had a broad variation in pigmentation. Nine of 16 adults
with the duplication, but none of the 10 without it, had a diffusing
capacity for carbon monoxide that was less than 80% of the predicted
value. High-resolution computed tomography in all 12 patients with the
16-bp duplication revealed minimal fibrosis in 8, moderate fibrosis in
1, severe fibrosis in 1, and no fibrosis in 2. Computed tomography in 8
patients without the duplication revealed minimal fibrosis in 3 and no
fibrosis in the rest. Inflammatory bowel disease developed in 8 patients
(4 in each group) between 3 and 25 years of age. Thus, the 16-bp
duplication in exon 15 of the HPS gene, which had been found only in
Puerto Rican patients, is associated with a broad range of pigmentation
and an increased risk of restrictive lung disease in adults.

.0002
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 1-BP INS, 322C

In the inbred Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300) kindred studied by
Schallreuter et al. (1993), Oh et al. (1996) identified homozygosity for
a frameshift at codon pro324, due to an additional cytosine in a run of
8 cytosines, in the HPS gene. This same mutation (T322insC) was found in
an unrelated Irish-German patient (Oh et al., 1998). The 2 patients were
divergent for intragenic polymorphisms that flank this mutation; the
findings suggested that this frameshift arose independently in the 2
populations. A third patient was homozygous for the frameshift mutation
and for the polymorphic haplotype found in the patient of Irish-German
origin. Patient 4 was a compound heterozygote for the Swiss type
mutation but associated, however, with the Irish-German haplotype; the
other allele in this patient had a novel nonsense mutation, glu666 to
ter (604982.0003).

.0003
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, GLU666TER

In a non-Puerto Rican case of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300), Oh et
al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for the T322insC frameshift
mutation (604982.0002) and a novel nonsense mutation, glu666 to ter
(E666X).

.0004
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 1-BP DEL, 322C

Oh et al. (1998) described a Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (203300) patient
who was homozygous for a novel frameshift mutation in the HPS gene,
T322delC, that involved the same poly(C) tract involved in the T322insC
frameshift (604982.0002).

.0005
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, GLU133TER

Shotelersuk et al. (1998) studied 18 non-Puerto Rican Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (203300) families and identified HPS mutations in 3 of them. In
1 patient, one of the newly identified mutations, E133X, was present in
compound state with a previously described mutation, T322insC
(604982.0002). The patient was a 6-year-old girl of Italian, German, and
Ukrainian ancestry. Born with pale skin, she was noted to have nystagmus
at 2 months of age and pale retinas at 3 months of age, when
oculocutaneous albinism was diagnosed. Bruising began at 7 to 8 months
of age, and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome was diagnosed at 18 months of age
based on abnormal platelet aggregation studies. Epistaxis occurred in
the winter months and prolonged bleeding accompanied a cut lip and
placement of myringotomy tubes. Asthma was diagnosed at 1 year of age.
There were no signs of colitis or pulmonary fibrosis.

.0006
HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 1
HPS1, 1-BP INS, 962G

Horikawa et al. (2000) reported a Japanese man with Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome (203300), who had oculocutaneous albinism and a bleeding
diathesis. The patient was a compound heterozygote for 2 HPS1 mutations:
a frameshift mutation (962-963insG) at codon 321 in exon 11; and a
5-prime splice-junction mutation (IVS5+5G-A). The content of eumelanin
in the patient's hairs was significantly reduced. Histologic analysis
using light and electron microscopy revealed that melanocytes in the
patient's epidermis contained giant melanosomes.

613632	TITLE *613632 WAS PROTEIN FAMILY HOMOLOG 1; WASH1
;;WASH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) cloned WASH1, which they called WASH. The
deduced protein contains 468 amino acids. WASH has 2 WASH homology
domains (WHD1 and WHD2) in its N-terminal half. In its C-terminal half,
WASH has a proline-rich stretch followed by a WH2 actin (see
102560)-binding domain (V), a central region (C), and an acidic stretch
(A) that together form the VCA module found in all WASP proteins (see
WASF1; 605035). The VCA module mediates binding to actin and the ARP2/3
protein complex (604221) and stimulates actin nucleation. Northern blot
analysis detected an approximately 1.8-kb transcript in all tissues
examined. RNA dot blot analysis and RT-PCR confirmed ubiquitous and
variable WASH1 expression. Database analysis revealed WASH orthologs in
both vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates showed highest
conservation in the WASH C terminus. Fluorescence-tagged WASH1
colocalized with cytoskeletal actin and accumulated in filopodia and
lamellipodia.

Using Western blot analysis of Jurkat human T cells, Gomez and Billadeau
(2009) detected WASH at an apparent molecular mass of 70 kD. HeLa cells
expressed a WASH isoform lacking the N-terminal region.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a punctate cytoplasmic WASH
distribution in Jurkat, HeLa, and U-87MG glioblastoma cell lines.

- Copy Number Variation

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) identified numerous subtelomeric copies of
the WASH gene distributed among multiple human chromosomes. FISH
analysis revealed variation in their copy number and location among
primate species and human individuals. Sequencing of long-range PCR
products from 3 unrelated individuals revealed up to 5 potentially
functional WASH variants and multiple pseudogenes per individual human
genome.

GENE FUNCTION

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) found that the isolated VCA module of
recombinant human WASH1 stimulated in vitro actin polymerization in the
presence of the ARP2/3 complex.

Gomez and Billadeau (2009) found that WASH was required for retrograde
transport of cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (IGF2R;
147280) via the retromer complex (see 601272). WASH functioned in a
multiprotein complex of over 600 kD that also contained FAM21 (see
FAM21C; 613631) and APR2/3. Mutation analysis revealed that the N
terminus of WASH interacted with FAM21, the WHD2 domain interacted with
alpha-tubulin (see 602529), and the VCA region interacted with actin.
WASH interaction with FAM21 was required for its endosomal localization.
Knockdown of WASH blocked retromer-mediated endosome sorting.

GENE STRUCTURE

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) determined that the WASH1 gene contains 11
exons and spans 15 kb. The first exon is noncoding and lies within a CpG
island.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Linardopoulou et al. (2007) mapped the
WASH1 gene to the subtelomeric region of chromosome 9p, where it ends
within 5 kb of the telomere array. Linardopoulou et al. (2007)
identified WASH pseudogenes on similar subtelomeric regions of
chromosomes 15q, 1p, Xq/Yq, and 16p. The single-copy mouse Wash ortholog
maps to an internal location on chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Linardopoulou et al. (2007) found that knockout of the Drosophila WASH
ortholog, which they called washout, was early embryonic lethal.

182465	TITLE *182465 SON DNA-BINDING PROTEIN; SON
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SON is a nuclear speckle-localized protein that shares homology with
pre-mRNA splicing accessory factors (Wynn et al., 2000).

CLONING

Berdichevskii et al. (1988) cloned a fragment designated Son3 from a
human embryonic cDNA bank. The nucleotide sequence was found to be 1,454
bp long with 6 possible open reading frames, only 1 of which did not
contain terminating codons. Translation of that open reading frame into
an amino acid sequence and database analysis showed that the Son3 region
codes for a protein with the following distinctive features: (1) the
presence of a cluster of short tandem repeats from 7 to 19 amino acids
long, located in the central part of the sequence; (2) the presence of
lengthy regions of homology with certain DNA-binding structural
proteins, such as gallin (55%), and also with oncoproteins encoded by
protooncogenes of the MYC family; and (3) the presence of a region of
homology with an oncoprotein encoded by the MOS protooncogene (190060).

Wynn et al. (2000) independently identified human SON, which shares
84.2% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. SON has a basic
serine/arginine-rich C-terminal domain that shares homology with
proteins involved in mRNA processing. Immunofluorescence studies
localized endogenous SON to interchromatin granules of the interphase
nucleus in human epithelial cells. The nuclear speckled staining pattern
was similar to that observed with mRNA splicing factors, suggesting that
SON may play a role in mRNA processing.

GENE FUNCTION

From a human keratinocyte cDNA library, Khan et al. (1994) isolated a
clone for the DNA-binding protein SON. Using this clone, they found that
the SON gene is expressed in various cell types and that homologous
sequences can be detected in vertebrate and insect genomic DNA.

Using a combination of proteomics, cytology, and functional analysis in
C. elegans, Chu et al. (2006) reduced 1,099 proteins copurified with
spermatogenic chromatin to 132 proteins for functional analysis. This
strategy to find fertility factors conserved from C. elegans to mammals
achieved its goal: of mouse gene knockouts corresponding to nematode
proteins, 37% (7 of 19) cause male sterility. This list includes PPP1CC
(176914), H2AX (601772), SON, TOP1 (126420), DDX4 (605281), DBY
(400010), and CENPC (117141).

Karlas et al. (2010) reported the discovery of 287 human host cell genes
influencing influenza A virus replication, including SON, in a
genomewide RNA interference screen. Using an independent assay, Karlas
et al. (2010) confirmed 168 hits (59%) inhibiting either the endemic
HIN1 (119 hits) or the pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A
virus strains, with an overlap of 60%. SON was found to be important for
normal trafficking of influenza virions to late endosomes early in
infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

Slavov et al. (2000) predicted that the SON gene contains 10 exons
spanning 25 kb. Wynn et al. (2000) determined that the SON gene contains
12 exons.

MAPPING

Using PCR to amplify SON sequences from a panel of somatic cell hybrids,
Khan et al. (1994) assigned the human SON gene to chromosome 21. By use
of hybrids containing regions of chromosome 21, the localization was
refined to 21q22.1-q22.2.

Wynn et al. (2000) determined that both human and mouse SON and DONSON
(611428) are in tail-to-tail orientation and in the following order:
GART (138440)-SON-DONSON.

609374	TITLE *609374 CELL DIVISION CYCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 5; CDCA5
;;SORORIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential expression analysis for genes coexpressed with cell
cycle genes (e.g., CDC2; 116940), Walker (2001) identified CDCA5.

Rankin et al. (2005) identified Xenopus Cdca5, which they called p35, by
a proteomic screen for anaphase-promoting complex (APC) substrates. By
searching databases for sequences similar to Xenopus p35, they
identified human and mouse CDCA5. The deduced human and mouse proteins
contain 252 and 264 amino acids, respectively. Both contain a KEN box
for APC-dependent ubiquitination. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a
punctate nuclear distribution of CDCA5 during interphase and a diffuse
distribution of CDCA5 throughout the cell during mitosis. There was no
apparent concentration of CDCA5 on chromatin in mitotic cells. The level
of CDCA5 dropped in synchronized HeLa cells during interphase.

Nishiyama et al. (2010) found that epitope-tagged mouse sororin
accumulated on chromatin in transfected HeLa cells between early S and
G2 phases and became dispersed in the cytoplasm following nuclear
envelope breakdown. It was also enriched at centromeres in prometaphase
and metaphase.

GENE FUNCTION

Rankin et al. (2005) found that overexpression of CDCA5 in Xenopus
embryos caused failure to resolve and segregate sister chromatids in
mitosis and increased the amount of cohesin associated with metaphase
chromosomes. In cultured human and mouse cells, depletion of CDCA5
caused mitotic arrest and the complete failure of sister chromatid
cohesion. Rankin et al. (2005) hypothesized that CDCA5 regulates the
ability of the cohesin complex to mediate sister chromatid cohesion.
They proposed calling the CDCA5 protein sororin, from the Latin word
soror, meaning sister, because of its role in sister chromatid cohesion.

Using RNA interference, Nishiyama et al. (2010) found that knockdown of
sororin in HeLa cells caused failure of chromosome congression,
consistent with a cohesion defect prior to metaphase. Depletion of Scc1
(RAD21; 606462) or Sgo1 (SGOL1; 609168) in Xenopus oocytes reduced
chromosomal sororin staining, suggesting that association of sororin
with mitotic chromosomes depends upon cohesin. Geminin (GMNN; 602842), a
protein that inhibits cohesin loading onto DNA, abolished association of
sororin with chromatin. Inhibition of DNA replication in HeLa cells also
reduced sororin levels on chromatin. Knockdown studies revealed that
sororin was only required for chromosome cohesion in the presence of
WAPL (WAPAL; 610754), which functions to destabilize chromosome
cohesion. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that sororin interacted
with the WAPL-binding protein PDS5 (see PDS5A; 613200) and displaced
WAPL from its interaction with PDS5. Nishiyama et al. (2010) concluded
that sororin maintains sister chromatid cohesion by inhibiting
WAPL-induced dissociation of cohesin from DNA.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the CDCA5 gene to chromosome 11q13.1 based on an
alignment of the CDCA5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC011000) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

601437	TITLE *601437 Fc FRAGMENT OF IgG, RECEPTOR TRANSPORTER, ALPHA; FCGRT
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN RECEPTOR, INTESTINAL, HEAVY CHAIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The intestinal epithelium of neonatal mice and rats expresses an Fc
receptor (FcRn) that mediates the selective uptake of immunoglobulin G
(IgG) in mothers' milk, thereby helping newborn animals to acquire
passive immunity. Kandil et al. (1996) noted that the IgG in the milk is
bound to FcRn at the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium, and
the resultant FcRn-IgG complexes are transcytosed across the epithelium.
At the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells, IgG is
released from FcRn into blood or tissue fluids. FcRn is structurally
similar to the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule, which
presents antigenic peptides to T cells. Like the MHC class I molecule,
FcRn is made up of a heavy chain (approximately 48 kD) and
beta-2-microglobulin (109700; approximately 12 kD). Its heavy chain
shows approximately 35% amino acid sequence identity to that of a
typical MHC class I molecule. Furthermore, the genomic organizations of
the MHC class I and mouse FcRn heavy chain genes are similar in that the
signal peptide, the 3 extracellular domains, the transmembrane region,
and the cytoplasmic region are all encoded by separate exons. Story et
al. (1994) cloned a cDNA encoding the human gene and symbolized it FcRn.
Kandil et al. (1996) isolated human genomic clones for the gene
(symbolized FCGRT by them) using 2 murine Fcgrt probes. The exonic
sequences of the genomic clones are identical to the cDNA sequence
described by Story et al. (1994).

GENE FUNCTION

Plasma protein catabolism occurs in vascular endothelium by endocytotic
processing of plasma contents. Vascular endothelium is the most active
endocytic tissue in the body and the principal site for plasma protein
catabolism. Plasma proteins diffusing or transported into extravascular
sites are isolated from catabolism while extravascular. The receptor
encoded by the FCGRT gene, alternatively called the Brambell receptor,
the protection receptor, or the neonatal receptor, is located in
endosomes of vascular endothelial cells and selectively recycles IgG to
the cell surface, thus protecting IgG from lysosomal catabolism that is
the fate of other, nonprotected plasma proteins. In mice with knockout
of this receptor, the fractional catabolic rate for IgG may be
accelerated up to 10-fold relative to wildtype animals in which
protection is intact (Junghans and Anderson, 1996). This protection
mechanism is directly responsible for making IgG the longest lived of
all plasma proteins (Waldmann and Strober, 1969).

Junghans et al. (2001) postulated that long-range cis inactivation of
the FCGRT gene is responsible for hypercatabolism of IgG in myotonic
dystrophy (DM; 160900). The FCGRT gene is closely situated to the DMPK
gene (605377), which is mutant in DM.

MAPPING

Ahouse et al. (1993) found that the mouse FcRn heavy chain gene,
designated Fcgrt, maps to chromosome 7 and thus is not encoded by the
MHC. Kandil et al. (1996) showed by fluorescence in situ hybridization
that the human gene, FCGRT, maps to 19q13.3. Thus, like its mouse
counterpart, FCGRT is not encoded by the MHC.

ANIMAL MODEL

Akilesh et al. (2004) showed that mice lacking FcRn were resistant to
transient inflammatory arthritis induced in wildtype mice upon transfer
of serum from arthritic K/BxN mice, which are universally susceptible to
autoimmune arthritis due to pathogenic anti-GPI (172400) IgG antibodies.
K/BxN mice deficient in FcRn had significantly delayed onset of
arthritis or only intermittent ankle inflammation without arthritic
disease, and they had low anti-GPI antibody titers without high B-cell
levels in popliteal lymph nodes during the experimental period.
Heterozygote and sick homozygote mice had lymphocytes expressing the
B-cell maturation markes Prdm1 (603423) and Tnfrsf17 (109545), the Th2
cytokines IL1b (147720) and IL10 (124092), the chemokines Scya20 (CCL20;
601960) and Scya3 (CCL3; 182283), and Fcgr1 (146760). Treatment of mice
with high-dose intravenous Ig (IVIg) reduced or eliminated arthritis
dependent on the presence of Fcgr2 (146790) and/or FcRn. Akilesh et al.
(2004) concluded that these findings provide a rational basis for the
use of IVIg and suggested that FcRn is a potential therapeutic target
linking the initiation and effector phases of humoral autoimmune
disease.

In contrast to rodents, in humans FcRn is expressed in adults, in
placenta--where it serves to transport IgG from mother to fetus (Story
et al., 1994)--and in several absorptive epithelial tissues, including
the lung, kidney, and intestine. The expression of FcRn in absorptive
epithelia, coupled with the description by Dickinson et al. (1999) of
FcRn transport of IgG through human intestinal epithelial cells in
vitro, suggested to Bitonti et al. (2004) that FcRn might be exploited
for the delivery of therapeutic proteins by conjugation of the proteins
to an FcRn-binding ligand, such as the Fc fragment of IgG1, which would
allow their transport across the epithelium. Bitonti et al. (2004)
showed that FcRn-mediated transport is functional in the lung of
nonhuman primates and that this transport system can be used to deliver
erythropoietin (EPO; 133170) when it is conjugated to the Fc region of
IgG1. Erythropoietin is a hormone used to stimulate red blood cell
production but requiring chronic therapy with either intravenous or
subcutaneous injection, making an alternative noninvasive method of
delivery desirable. FcRn-dependent absorption was more efficient when
the EPO-Fc fusion protein was deposited predominantly in the upper and
central airways of the lung, where epithelial expression FcRn was most
prominently detected. The bioavailability of an EPO-Fc monomer when
delivered through the lung was approximately equal to that reported for
unconjugated EPO delivered subcutaneously in humans. These studies
showed that FcRn can be harnessed to noninvasively deliver bioactive
proteins into the systemic circulation in therapeutic quantities.

186973	TITLE *186973 IL2-INDUCIBLE T-CELL KINASE; ITK
;;TYROSINE KINASE EXPRESSED MAINLY IN T CELLS; EMT;;
T-CELL ITK/TSK TYROSINE KINASE, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ITK gene encodes IL2 (147680)-inducible T-cell kinase, which is
important for proper T-cell development, T-cell receptor (TCR)
signaling, cytokine release, and regulation of differentiation. ITK is
analogous to Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK; 300300), which is specifically
expressed in B cells and instrumental for their undisturbed development,
differentiation, and signaling (summary by Linka et al., 2012).

CLONING

Signal transduction through the T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880) and
cytokine receptors on the surface of T lymphocytes occurs largely via
tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates. Signal
transduction is thought to occur via association of these receptors with
intracellular protein tyrosine kinases. To identify unique T-cell
tyrosine kinases, Gibson et al. (1993) used PCR-based cloning with
degenerate oligonucleotides directed at highly conserved motifs of
tyrosine kinase domains. In this way, they cloned the complete cDNA for
a unique human tyrosine kinase that is expressed mainly in T lymphocytes
and natural killer (NK) cells. The cDNA predicted an open reading frame
of 1,866 bp encoding a protein with a predicted size of 72 kD, which was
in keeping with its size on Western blotting. A single 6.2-kb mRNA and
72-kD protein were detected in T lymphocytes and NK-like cell lines, but
were not detected in other cell lineages. Sequence comparisons suggested
that the protein is probably the human homolog of a murine
interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK). However, unlike ITK, the
message and protein levels for the new entity did not vary markedly on
stimulation of human IL-2 responsive T cells with IL-2. They referred to
the gene and its protein product as EMT ('expressed mainly in T cells').
They concluded that EMT is a member of a new family of intracellular
kinases that includes BPK (the kinase mutant in X-linked
agammaglobulinemia, 300300). The expression of EMT message and protein
in thymocytes and mature T cells, combined with its homology to BPK and
its chromosomal localization, suggested that EMT may play a role in
thymic ontogeny and growth regulation of mature T cells.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

ITK is the T-cell-specific homolog of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK),
which is mutant in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (300300). Cheng et al.
(1994) showed that BTK interacts with 3 protein-tyrosine kinases that
get activated upon stimulation of B- and T-cell receptors. These
interactions are mediated by two 10-amino acid motifs in BTK; an
analogous site with the same specificity is also present in ITK.

GENE FUNCTION

Integrin adhesion receptors mediate critical interactions of T cells
with other cells and extracellular matrix components during trafficking,
as well as during antigen-specific recognition events in tissue.
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 601232) has a role in the
regulation of integrin activity by CD3 (see 186790)-TCR and in the
regulation of ITK. Woods et al. (2001) determined that TCR-mediated
activation of beta-1 integrins (see ITGB1; 135630) requires activation
of ITK and PI3K-dependent recruitment of ITK to detergent-insoluble
glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (DIGs) via binding of the
pleckstrin homology domain of ITK to the PI3K product PI(3,4,5)-P3.
Likewise, activation of PI3K and LCK (153390) via CD4 (186940)
coreceptor stimulation can initiate beta-1 integrin activation dependent
on ITK function. CD4 stimulation, together with targeting of ITK to
DIGs, also activates TCR-independent beta-1 integrin function. Changes
in beta-1 integrin function mediated by TCR-induced activation of ITK
are accompanied by ITK-dependent modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
Woods et al. (2001) concluded that TCR-mediated activation of beta-1
integrin involves membrane relocalization and activation of ITK via
coordinate action of PI3K and an SRC family tyrosine kinase.

Hwang et al. (2005) reported that TBET (604895) represses Th2 lineage
commitment through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between itself
and GATA3 (131320) that interferes with the binding of GATA3 to its
target DNA. Hwang et al. (2005) concluded that their results provide a
novel function for tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in
specifying alternate fates of a common progenitor cell. Hwang et al.
(2005) showed that TBET phosphorylation is restricted to the TEC kinases
ITK and RLK (600058). Coexpression studies demonstrated that this was
most efficiently performed by ITK. In primary CD4 T cells isolated from
ITK-, RLK-, or double ITK/RLK-deficient mice, the greatest diminution of
TBET tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in the absence of ITK.
Furthermore, mutation of TBET at tyrosine residue 525, but not control
tyrosine residue 437, resulted in greatly reduced phosphorylation by
ITK, revealing that ITK phosphorylates TBET at residue Y525 after T cell
receptor stimulation.

Huang et al. (2007) showed that phosphorylation of inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) into IP4 promoted pleckstrin homology domain
binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and was required for
full activation of Itk in primary mouse thymocytes. They proposed that
IP4 establishes a feedback loop of phospholipase C-gamma-1 (PLCG1;
172420) activation through ITK that is essential for T-cell development.

MAPPING

Gibson et al. (1993) mapped the EMT gene to chromosome 5q31-q32 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Janis et al. (1994) mapped the human ITK gene to
5q32-q33. By Southern blot analysis of DNA from the progeny of 2
multilocus crosses, the murine Itk gene was mapped to chromosome 11 in a
region of homology to human 5q. The region in humans is frequently
deleted in the myelodysplastic syndrome.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 sisters with autosomal recessive fatal EBV-associated
lymphoproliferative syndrome-1 (LPFS1; 613011), Huck et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ITK gene (R355W; 186973).

In 3 members of a consanguineous Arab family with lymphoproliferative
syndrome-1, Stepensky et al. (2011) identified a homozygous truncating
mutation in the ITK gene (Y588X; 186973.0002). The mutation, which was
found by homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing,
segregated with the disorder in the family.

In a patient, born of consanguineous Moroccan parents, with
lymphoproliferative syndrome-1, Linka et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous missense mutation in the ITK gene (R29H; 186973.0003). Linka
et al. (2012) performed functional studies on cells from the patients
reported by Huck et al. (2009), Stepensky et al. (2011), and Linka et
al. (2012), and found that all had a reduced calcium signaling response
after TCR stimulation and were unable to enhance calcium response in
Itk-null mouse cells, consistent with a loss of function. In vitro
studies showed that all mutant proteins had reduced half-lives; the R29H
mutation impeded membrane targeting of ITK.

ANIMAL MODEL

By homologous recombination, Schaeffer et al. (1999) disrupted the Rlk
(TXK; 600058) gene in mice. Heterozygotes were completely normal.
Homozygous null Rlk mice showed increased amounts of Itk mRNA. The
authors hypothesized that upregulation of related Tec kinases may
partially compensate for the lack of Rlk. Schaeffer et al. (1999)
therefore generated Rlk -/- Itk -/- mice by interbreeding. Itk-deficient
mice have reduced numbers of mature T cells, particularly CD4+ cells,
causing a decreased CD4-to-CD8 ratio. Rlk -/- Itk -/- mutants, however,
had normal T cell numbers. Both CD4+ and CD8+ cell numbers are increased
relative to Itk -/- mice. The persistent abnormal ratio of CD4+ to CD8+
cells suggested an altered regulation of lymphoid development and
homeostasis in the double mutants. The double mutants had marked defects
in T-cell receptor responses including proliferation, cytokine
production, and apoptosis in vitro and adaptive immune responses to
Toxoplasma gondii in vivo. Molecular events immediately downstream from
the T-cell receptor were intact in Rlk -/- Itk -/- cells, but
intermediate events including inositol trisphosphate production, calcium
mobilization, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation were
impaired, establishing Tec kinases as critical regulators of T-cell
receptor signaling required for phospholipase C-gamma activation.

Using flow cytometry, Dubois et al. (2006) found that Il15 (600554) -/-
mice lacked Cd44 (107269)-hi/Cd122 (IL2RB; 146710)-hi memory phenotype
Cd8-positive T cells in both the periphery and thymus, whereas Itk -/-
mice lacked Cd44-lo/Cd122-lo naive Cd8-positive T cells in the periphery
and thymus. Mice lacking both Itk and Il15 had a severe reduction of all
CD8-positive T cells. Dubois et al. (2006) proposed that there are 2
distinct populations of CD8-positive T cells dependent on ITK or IL15,
and that the IL15-dependent CD44-hi/CD122-hi memory phenotype
CD8-positive T cells have functions in both innate and adaptive
immunity.

Broussard et al. (2006) found that Cd8-positive T cells from mice
lacking Itk or both Itk and Rlk expressed memory markers (e.g., Cd44 and
Cd122) and rapidly produced Ifng (147570). Itk deficiency greatly
increased the number of cells selected by MHC class Ib. Broussard et al.
(2006) concluded that the absence of TEC kinases prevents conventional
CD8-positive T-cell development and leads to generation of a large
population of nonconventional innate-type CD8-positive T cells. Atherly
et al. (2006) presented similar findings.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME 1
ITK, ARG335TRP

In 2 Turkish sisters, born of consanguineous parents, with fatal
EBV-associated lymphoproliferative syndrome-1 (LPFS1; 613011), Huck et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1085C-T transition in exon 11 of the
ITK gene, resulting in an arg335-to-trp (R335W) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the BG loop of the SH2 domain. Attempts to
functionally express the R335W mutant in bacteria failed due to
aggregation of the recombinant protein, whereas wildtype protein was
stable and expressed functionally at high levels. Functional expression
in 293T cells showed mRNA expression of the mutant transcript, but
nearly undetectable ITK protein, consistent with severe protein
instability. Both girls developed chronic active EBV infection in early
childhood that was resistant to treatment. The disorder progressed to
lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, B-cell proliferation, and Hodgkin
lymphoma in 1 girl. There were extremely low levels of the protein in
lymph node biopsy from 1 of the girls. Both unaffected parents were
heterozygous for the mutation. The mutation was not identified in 100
Turkish and 100 German children.

Linka et al. (2012) showed that cells from the patients reported by Huck
et al. (2009) had a reduced calcium signaling response after TCR
stimulation and were unable to enhance calcium response in Itk-null
mouse cells, consistent with a loss of function.

.0002
LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME 1
ITK, TYR588TER

In 3 members of a consanguineous Arab family with lymphoproliferative
syndrome-1 (613011), Stepensky et al. (2011) identified a homozygous
c.1764C-G transversion in exon 16 of the ITK gene, resulting in a
tyr588-to-ter (Y588X) substitution that would disrupt the ITK kinase
domain. The mutation, which was found by homozygosity mapping followed
by candidate gene sequencing, segregated with the disorder in the
family. The patients presented between ages 3 and 5 years with fever,
lymphadenopathy, and Hodgkin lymphoma associated with EBV infection. One
patient was treated successfully with chemotherapy but later developed
fatal hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; the second patient was treated
successfully with chemotherapy but later developed autoimmune renal
disease and was treated successfully with antiviral therapy; and the
third patient underwent successful bone marrow transplant from a donor
sib who was heterozygous for the mutation.

Linka et al. (2012) showed that cells from the patient reported by
Stepensky et al. (2011) had a reduced calcium signaling response after
TCR stimulation and were unable to enhance calcium response in Itk-null
mouse cells, consistent with a loss of function.

.0003
LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME 1
ITK, ARG29HIS

In a patient, born of consanguineous Moroccan parents, with
lymphoproliferative syndrome-1 (613011), Linka et al. (2012) identified
a homozygous c.86G-A transition in the ITK gene, resulting in an
arg29-to-his (R29H) substitution in the pleckstrin homology domain. The
patient was diagnosed at age 11 years with an EBV-associated B-cell
lymphoproliferative disorder. He also had autoimmune hemolytic anemia,
thrombocytopenia, and progressive lymphopenia. He died at age 26 years.
Patient cells had a reduced calcium signaling response after TCR
stimulation and were unable to enhance calcium response in Itk-null
mouse cells, consistent with a loss of function. In vitro studies showed
that the R29H mutation impeded membrane targeting of ITK.

611575	TITLE *611575 STERILE ALPHA MOTIF DOMAIN-CONTAINING 8; SAMD8
;;SPHINGOMYELIN SYNTHASE-RELATED; SMSR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences encoding motifs characteristic of
SM synthases (see 611573), Huitema et al. (2004) identified SAMD8, which
they called SMSR. The deduced 415-amino acid protein contains 5
membrane-spanning alpha helices connected by hydrophilic extramembrane
loops. SMSR also contains 4 highly conserved motifs, designated D1 to
D4.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the SAMD8 gene to chromosome 10q22.2 based on an
alignment of the SAMD8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK057811) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

609451	TITLE *609451 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 90, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; ZFP90
;;NK10;;
KIAA1954
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Lange et al. (1995) cloned mouse Zfp90, which they designated Nk10. The
predominant cDNA encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of
72.4 kD. The N-terminal half of Zfp90 contains KRAB A and B domains, and
the C-terminal half contains 13 C2H2-type zinc finger motifs. Lange et
al. (1995) also identified alternatively spliced Zfp90 cDNAs with
5-prime extensions of exons 4 and 5. Northern blot analysis detected a
2.4-kb transcript expressed at highest levels in brain, heart, spleen,
and thymus. RT-PCR of mouse embryos detected Zfp90 expression
predominantly in brain. At about postnatal week 2, it was expressed in
most other tissues tested. At postnatal days 18 to 20, it was detected
in testicular tissue, simultaneous with the appearance of haploid cells.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) obtained a partial ZFP90 clone, which they
designated KIAA1954. The transcript contains 2 SINEs in its 3-prime UTR.
The deduced protein shares 50% identity with ZNF471 and 85% identity
with Halobacterium transcription initiation factor IIB5. RT-PCR ELISA
detected intermediate to high expression in all adult and fetal tissues
and specific brain regions examined. Within whole tissues, highest ZPF90
expression was in spleen. Within specific brain regions, highest
expression was in caudate nucleus and substantia nigra.

GENE FUNCTION

Lange et al. (1995) demonstrated that mouse Zfp90 could bind DNA.
Binding was zinc dependent and required zinc fingers 2 through 8. The
KRAB domains of Zfp90 repressed reporter gene expression. The KRAB A
domain alone reduced reporter gene expression by 75 to 80%, and the KRAB
B domain reduced expression by 10 to 20%. Both domains together
repressed reporter gene expression nearly completely.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lange et al. (1995) determined that the mouse Zfp90 gene contains 5
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the ZFP90 gene
to chromosome 16. Using backcross analysis, Lange et al. (1995) mapped
the mouse Zfp90 gene to a region of chromosome 8D3 that shares homology
of synteny with human chromosome 16q22.1.

146740	TITLE *146740 Fc FRAGMENT OF IgG, LOW AFFINITY IIIa, RECEPTOR FOR; FCGR3A
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN G Fc RECEPTOR III-2;;
FCRIII-2;;
CD16A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FCGR3, or CD16) is encoded by
2 nearly identical genes, FCGR3A and FCGR3B (610665), resulting in
tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.
FCGR3A encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on activated
monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subset of T
cells. In contrast, FCGR3B encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed constitutively by neutrophils
and after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) stimulation by eosinophils
(summary by Gessner et al., 1995).

CLONING

By Western blot and flow cytometric analyses, Ravetch and Perussia
(1989) demonstrated differential expression of FCGR3 on
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and NK cells. The glycoprotein on
NK cells (FCGR3A) had a molecular mass 6 to 10 kD larger than that on
neutrophils (FCGR3B) and was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C. Transcripts derived from FCGR3A and FCGR3B in NK cells
and PMNs, respectively, have multiple single nucleotide differences,
including 1 that converts a termination codon to a codon encoding arg,
thereby extending the cytoplasmic domain by 21 amino acids and
introducing a transmembrane anchor for FCGR3A in NK cells. The deduced
FCGR3A protein contains 254 amino acids, whereas the deduced FCGR3B
protein contains 233 amino acids. Ravetch and Perussia (1989) concluded
that cell type-specific expression of 2 genes encoding alternative FCGR3
proteins has a significant effect on the biologic functions of the
molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gessner et al. (1995) isolated and sequenced genomic clones of FCGR3A
and FCGR3B, located their transcription initiation sites, identified the
different organizations of their 5-prime regions, and demonstrated 4
distinct classes of FCGR3A transcripts compared with a single class of
FCGR3B transcripts. The gene promoters displayed different
tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting expression of
FCGR3A in NK cells and FCGR3B in neutrophils.

MAPPING

Le Coniat et al. (1990) mapped the FCGR3A gene to chromosome 1q23 by in
situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Anderson et al. (1990) concluded that CD16 is included in the zeta
natural killer cell receptor complex (CD3Z; 186780).

Some gamma-delta T cells (see TCRG, 186970 and TCRD, 186810) express
CD16. Using flow cytometric analysis, Bodman-Smith et al. (2000)
examined the relative proportions of CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in the
blood and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) patients
and the blood of control subjects. There was a significant reduction in
CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in synovial fluid compared with the
circulation. Mitogenic stimulation of circulating gamma-delta T cells
resulted in an increased expression of the HLA-DR activation marker and
a concomitant time-dependent decrease in the expression of CD16.
Bodman-Smith et al. (2000) concluded that CD16 expression is lost in the
synovial compartment as a result of activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

On the natural killer (NK) cells of a 3-year-old boy who suffered from
recurrent viral respiratory tract infections since birth, de Vries et
al. (1996) found an unusual CD16 phenotype. The child also had severe
clinical problems with BCG vaccination and after Epstein-Barr virus and
varicella-zoster virus infections. His peripheral blood lymphocytes
contained a normal percentage and absolute number of CD3(-)CD7(+) cells,
which were positively stained with CD16 monoclonal antibodies. FCGR3
expression on granulocytes appeared to be normal. Sequence analysis of
the FCGR3A gene, encoding CD16 on NK cells and macrophages, showed a
T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230 on both alleles,
predicting a leucine to histidine amino acid change at position 48
(146740.0002).

By cloning and sequencing FCGR3A cDNA from NK cells and macrophages of a
heterozygous donor, de Haas et al. (1996) identified a 230T-G SNP that
resulted in a leu48-to-arg (L48R) substitution in the first
extracellular Ig-like domain and caused a higher electrophoretic
mobility of deglycosylated FCGR3A. PCR and restriction analysis
identified a 230T-A SNP, resulting in a leu48-to-his (L48H)
substitution, in another donor. Genotype analysis revealed a gene
frequency of 86% for 230T (L48), 6% for 230G (R48), and 8% for 230A
(H48) in 93 FCGR3B-positive individuals. In contrast, the frequency of
the 230G allele was significantly higher in 12 FCGR3B-deficient donors.
The H48 and R48 variants exhibited a higher binding capacity for IgG1,
IgG3, and IgG4 than did the common L48 variant. De Haas et al. (1996)
concluded that SNPs at position 230 of FCGR3A influence IgG binding, as
well as reactivity of CD16 monoclonal antibodies.

Koene et al. (1997) used PCR-based restriction analysis to genotype 87
donors for a 559T-G SNP in FCGR3A that results in a phe158-to-val
(F158V) substitution. They found gene frequencies of 57% and 43% for
F158 and V158, respectively. F158 was linked to L48, and V158 was linked
to R48 or H48. Through functional analysis, Koene et al. (1997)
determined that the previously identified differences in IgG binding
among the 3 FCGR3A variants at position 48 are a consequence of the
linked polymorphism at position 158.

Among 1,115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) and 654
controls, Robinson et al. (2012) found no significant association
between FCGR3A copy number and disease.

Although nearly all adults have been exposed to herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1, the clinical course of infection varies remarkably. By
analyzing the contribution of gene families on chromosomes 1, 6, 12, and
19 to susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in 302 individuals, Moraru et
al. (2012) identified no specific susceptibility locus. However, they
found that the risk of suffering clinical HSV-1 infection was modified
by MHC class I allotypes, HLA-C1 (142840) interaction with KIR2DL2
(604937), and the phe/val polymorphism at codon 158 of CD16A.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) found that Fcrg (FCER1G; 147139) -/-
mice showed reduced mortality in an acute peritonitis model caused by
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with wildtype mice. The
reduced mortality in Fcrg -/- mice was associated with lower serum and
peritoneal Tnf (191160) and significantly increased capacity of
neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose E. coli. Fcgr3 -/- mice also
had reduced sepsis after CLP. Fcgr3 bound E. coli, inducing Fcrg
phosphorylation, recruitment of tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 (PTPN6;
176883), and dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K;
see 171834). Decreased Pi3k activity inhibited E. coli phagocytosis and
increased Tnf production through Tlr4 (603030). Confocal microscopy
demonstrated negative regulation of Marco (604870) by Fcrg. Interaction
of E. coli with Fcgr3 induced recruitment of Shp1 to Marco and inhibited
E. coli phagocytosis. Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) concluded that
binding of E. coli to FCGR3 triggers an inhibitory FCRG pathway that
impairs MARCO-mediated bacterial clearance and activates TNF secretion.

In a 3-year-old boy who had suffered from recurrent viral respiratory
tract infections since birth, de Vries et al. (1996) found an unusual
CD16 phenotype on the natural killer (NK) cells. Sequence analysis of
the IGFR3 gene showed a T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230
on both alleles, predicting a leucine-to-histidine amino acid change at
position 48 in the first extracellular Ig-like domain of the FCGR3A
protein. The child had also had severe problems with BCG vaccination and
with Epstein-Barr virus and varicella-zoster virus infections. The
clinical pattern was considered compatible with an in vivo dysfunction
of NK cells. Only 1 patient with absolute NK cell deficiency had been
previously described. Biron et al. (1989) reported the case of an
adolescent with recurrent life-threatening herpesvirus infections, who
completely lacked CD16 and/or CD56 positive cells in vivo and
NK-activity in vitro. In a note added in proof, de Vries et al. (1996)
called attention to the case of homozygosity for a IGFR3 mutation
reported by Jawahar et al. (1996).
