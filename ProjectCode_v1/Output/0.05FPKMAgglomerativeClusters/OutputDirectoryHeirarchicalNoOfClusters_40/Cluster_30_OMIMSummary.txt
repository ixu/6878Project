;;PROCOLLAGEN, TYPE I, COOH-TERMINAL PROTEINASE ENHANCER
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Type I procollagen COOH-terminal proteinase enhancer is a glycoprotein
that binds to the COOH-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen and
enhances C-proteinase activity (Takahara et al., 1994).

CLONING

Takahara et al. (1994) purified type I procollagen COOH-terminal
proteinase enhancer (Pcolce) from mouse fibroblast culture medium.
Sequences of mouse enhancer cDNA predicted a 468-amino acid protein.
Takahara et al. (1994) noted that in the mouse, procollagen C-proteinase
depends for full expression upon the presence of either a 55-kD
glycoprotein or smaller 36- and 34-kD proteolytically processed forms of
the same protein. They showed that the 36-kD form corresponds to the
N-terminal portion of the 55-kD form, which is composed almost
exclusively of 2 CUB domains. Mouse enhancer RNA was shown to be at
highest levels in collagen-rich tissues, especially tendon.

Takahara et al. (1994) cloned human PCOLCE from a placenta cDNA library.
The deduced 449-amino acid protein shares high sequence homology with
the mouse protein, particularly in the CUB domains in the N terminus.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of genomic DNA from panels of human/mouse cell
hybrids and by fluorescence in situ hybridization, Takahara et al.
(1994) localized the PCOLCE gene to 7q21.3-q22, the same region
containing the type I collagen alpha-2 chain gene (COL1A2; 120160).
Takahara et al. (1996) investigated further the apparent proximity of
the 2 genes by the study of somatic cell hybrids, cosmid contigs, and
interspecific backcross mice. They found that PCOLCE and COL1A2 are
separated by at least 6 Mb and that Pcolce and Col1a2 are located on
separate chromosomes in the mouse, chromosomes 5 and 6, respectively.

;;MAC2-BINDING PROTEIN; MAC2BP;;
SERUM PROTEIN 90K; 90K;;
L3 ANTIGEN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the monoclonal antibody SP-2, Iacobelli et al. (1986), Iacobelli
et al. (1988), and Iacobelli et al. (1993) identified a 90-kD protein,
designated serum protein 90K, that was found at elevated concentrations
in the serum of patients with various types of breast, lung, colorectal,
ovary, and endometrial cancer. Koths et al. (1993) cloned a cDNA
encoding 90K, which they called MAC2BP, from a human monocytic cell line
cDNA library using degenerate PCR primers based on the protein sequence.
MAC2BP is a 585-amino acid protein containing an N-terminal region that
is 45% identical to the extracellular, cysteine-rich domain of
macrophage scavenger receptor (MSR1; 153622), indicating that MAC2BP is
a member of the MSR1 superfamily. Koths et al. (1993) showed by
immunoblotting that breast milk, serum, semen, saliva, urine, and tears
likely contain MAC2B.

Ullrich et al. (1994) found by Northern blot analysis that all examined
normal tissues, with the exception of peripheral blood lymphocytes,
contain high levels of a 2.2-kb 90K transcript, with the highest levels
present in the gastrointestinal tissues. They also showed that primary
tumor samples and tumor cell lines express the 90K transcript at widely
varying levels.

GENE FUNCTION

Koths et al. (1993) found that MAC2BP specifically bound the human
macrophage-associated lectin LGALS3 (153619) via a carbohydrate-specific
interaction.

Ullrich et al. (1994) noted that 90K is present at elevated levels in
the serum of subpopulations of patients with AIDS. They demonstrated
that 90K could stimulate host defense systems, such as natural killer
cell and lymphokine-activated killer cell activities, and could induce
secretion of interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680). Ullrich et al. (1994)
suggested that oncogenic transformation, viral infection, or invasion by
pathogens enhances the production of 90K, which then stimulates the host
immune system via induction of IL2 and possibly other cytokines.

Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis, Nonaka et
al. (2011) identified MAC2BP as a ligand for the lectin receptor DCSIGN
(CD209; 604672). DCSIGN recognized MAC2BP derived from some colorectal
carcinomas, but not from others. Recognition depended on the presence of
alpha-1,3,4-fucose moieties of Le glycans expressed on DCSIGN-binding
MAC2BP.

MAPPING

Calabrese et al. (1995) mapped the human 90K gene to chromosome 17q25 by
FISH. Brakebusch et al. (1997) used FISH to localize the mouse 90K gene
to chromosome 11, region E.

606609	TITLE *606609 3-PRIME @REPAIR EXONUCLEASE 1; TREX1
;;DNase III
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The multistep processes of DNA replication, repair, and recombination
require the excision of nucleotides from DNA 3-prime termini. Enzymes
containing 3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity remove mismatched,
modified, fragmented, and normal nucleotides to generate the appropriate
3-prime termini for subsequent steps in the DNA metabolic pathways
(Mazur and Perrino, 1999).

CLONING

By micropeptide sequence analysis of the 30-kD bovine Trex1 protein, PCR
with degenerate primers, and EST database searching, Mazur and Perrino
(1999) obtained cDNAs encoding mouse and human TREX1 and TREX2 (300370).
Sequence analysis predicted that the 304-amino acid TREX1 protein is 44%
identical to TREX2 (Mazur and Perrino (2001) corrected the TREX1
sequence to 314 amino acids). TREX1 contains 3 conserved exonuclease
motifs, with an HxAxxD sequence in the third motif. Functional analysis
confirmed that the 3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity of the
recombinant protein is comparable to that of the native protein and
prefers mismatched 3-prime termini. Mazur and Perrino (1999) concluded
that the TREX proteins are small, independent 3-prime excision enzymes,
whereas the multifunctional p53 (191170) and WRN (RECQL2; 604611)
proteins, which also have 3-prime-to-5-prime exonuclease activity, are
much larger.

Using rabbit Trex1 to search an EST database, Hoss et al. (1999) also
isolated human TREX1, which they termed DNase III. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of a 1.15-kb TREX1 transcript in all
tissues tested.

Mazur and Perrino (2001) used 5-prime RACE to identify the flanking
region of TREX1. Genomic sequence analysis suggested that TREX1 open
reading frames are produced by a variety of mechanisms, including
alternate promoter usage, alternative splicing, and varied sites for
3-prime cleavage. RT-PCR analysis detected ubiquitous expression of
TREX1.

GENE STRUCTURE

The TREX1 gene contains a single exon (Hoss et al., 1999; Mazur and
Perrino, 2001).

MAPPING

Hoss et al. (1999) and Mazur and Perrino (2001) identified clones
containing the TREX1 gene that map to chromosome 3p21.3-p21.2.

GENE FUNCTION

SET (600960) and NM23H1 (NME1; 156490) reside in an endoplasmic
reticulum-associated complex, the SET complex, that translocates to the
nucleus in response to superoxide generation by granzyme A (GZMA;
140050). Chowdhury et al. (2006) identified TREX1 as a component of the
SET complex. TREX1 bound SET and colocalized and translocated with the
SET complex. On its own, TREX1 did not damage intact DNA, but it acted
in concert with NM23H1 to destroy DNA during granzyme A-mediated cell
death. After NM23H1 nicked 1 strand, TREX1 removed bases from the free
3-prime end to enhance the damage and prevent DNA end reannealing and
repair.

Using mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis, Stetson et al. (2008)
identified mouse Trex1 as a protein involved in recognition of
interferon stimulatory DNA (ISD) BrdU-labeled intracellular
oligonucleotides. Microarray analysis showed that Trex1 was upregulated
in response to ISD stimulation. However, Trex1 -/- cells retained an
intact ISD response, ruling out Trex1 as the ISD sensor. In contrast
with Trex1 -/- mice, which succumb to lethal autoimmunity (see ANIMAL
MODEL), Trex1 -/- mice lacking Irf3 (603734), Ifnar1 (107450), or Rag2
(179616) survived and regained normal body weight through amelioration
of disease at discrete phases, indicating that TREX1 substrates are
ligands of the ISD pathway. Single-stranded DNA derived from endogenous
retroelements accumulated in Trex1 -/- cells, and Trex1 metabolized
reverse-transcribed DNA. Stetson et al. (2008) concluded that TREX1 is
an essential negative regulator of the ISD response and represents a
mechanism to prevent autoimmunity caused by endogenous retroelements.

Using mutation analysis with recombinant human TREX1, Fye et al. (2011)
found that arg174 and lys175 within the flexible loop and arg128 in the
catalytic core contributed to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) degradation. TREX1 degraded
endonuclease-treated hamster liver nuclei, suggesting that TREX1
contributes to apoptosis-associated DNA degradation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome 1

In affected members of 10 families with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
(AGS1; 225750), Crow et al. (2006) identified 5 different mutations in
the TREX1 gene in homozygous or compound heterozygous state (see, e.g.,
606609.0001-606609.0004). One of the mutations, R114H (606609.0001), was
identified in 7 European pedigrees. Crow et al. (2006) identified a
homozygous mutation in the TREX1 gene (606609.0002) in a patient
originally diagnosed with Cree encephalitis, indicating that Cree
encephalitis is essentially the same disorder as AGS1.

Rice et al. (2007) described a de novo heterozygous TREX1 mutation,
affecting a critical catalytic residue in TREX1 (D200N; 606609.0006),
that resulted in typical Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, thus defining a
dominant form of the disorder.

Haaxma et al. (2010) reported a second patient with Aicardi-Goutieres
syndrome and a de novo heterozygous TREX1 mutation (D18N; 606609.0007).
The D18N mutation had previously been identified in heterozygosity by
Lee-Kirsch et al. (2007) in a family with chilblain lupus.

- Susceptibility to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome shows overlap with systemic erythematosus
(SLE; 152700) at both clinical and pathologic levels. Lee-Kirsch et al.
(2007) analyzed the TREX1 gene in 417 patients with SLE and 1,712
controls and identified heterozygosity for a 3-prime UTR variant and 11
nonsynonymous changes in 12 patients (see, e.g., 606609.0001). They
found only 2 nonsynonymous changes in 2 controls (p = 1.7 X 10(-7),
relative risk = 25.3). In vitro studies of 2 frameshift mutations
revealed that both caused altered subcellular distribution.

- Chilblain Lupus

Rice et al. (2007) reported a heterozygous TREX1 mutation (606609.0005)
causing familial chilblain lupus (CHBL; 610448), a rare cutaneous form
of SLE.

In affected members of the large 5-generation German family with
chilblain lupus in which the disease was mapped to chromosome 3p21-p14
by Lee-Kirsch et al. (2006), Lee-Kirsch et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a missense mutation (D18N; 606609.0007) in the TREX1
gene.

- Retinal Vasculopathy with Cerebral Leukodystrophy

In 9 families with autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy with cerebral
leukodystrophy (192315), Richards et al. (2007) identified 5 different
heterozygous frameshift mutations at the C terminus of the TREX1 gene
(see, e.g., 606609.0008 and 606609.0009). In expression studies, the
truncated proteins retained exonuclease activity but lost normal
perinuclear localization.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The TREX1 D200N and D18N dominant heterozygous mutations are associated
with AGS1 and CHBL, respectively. Using exonuclease enzyme analysis,
Lehtinen et al. (2008) showed that TREX1 heterodimers containing
wildtype TREX1 and either D200N or D18N mutant proteins were completely
deficient in degrading dsDNA and degraded ssDNA at an approximately
2-fold lower rate than wildtype TREX1. In addition, D200N- and
D18N-containing homo- and heterodimers inhibited the dsDNA degradation
activity of wildtype TREX1, providing an explanation for the dominant
phenotype of the mutant alleles. In contrast, the R114H mutation, which
causes AGS1 when present as a homozygous mutation and SLE when present
as a heterozygous mutation, had dysfunctional dsDNA and ssDNA
degradation activities as a homodimer, but it was functional as a
heterodimer. The R114H homodimer lacked inhibitory activity against
wildtype TREX1, supporting the recessive genetics of the R114H mutation
in AGS1. Lehtinen et al. (2008) concluded that the dysfunctional dsDNA
activities of the disease-related TREX1 mutants could account for
persistent dsDNA from dying cells leading to an aberrant autoimmune
response in these disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morita et al. (2004) found that Trex1 -/- mice developed inflammatory
myocarditis, suggesting a role for this enzyme in immune regulation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
TREX1, ARG114HIS

In affected members of 7 families of European origin with
Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome-1 (225750), Crow et al. (2006) identified a
341G-A transition in the TREX1 gene, resulting in an arg114-to-his
(R114H) substitution at a residue predicted to be involved in protein
dimerization. Five of the families were homozygous for the mutation and
2 were compound heterozygous with another TREX1 mutation (606609.0003).
Patient-derived fibroblasts showed no detectable TREX1 3-prime
exonuclease activity.

Lee Kirsch et al. (2007) analyzed the TREX1 gene in 417 patients with
systemic lupus erythematosus (152700) and identified heterozygosity for
the R114H mutation in a European female patient who had nephritis,
arthritis, and antinuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies.

In an extensive study of the clinical and molecular phenotypes of
Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, Rice et al. (2007) found biallelic mutations
in TREX1 in 31 of 127 families with the clinical diagnosis of the
disorder. Eighteen families, 14 of which were of northern European
origin, were homozygous (15) or compound heterozygous (3) for the 341G-A
transition (R114H). Notably, all R114H homozygotes were also homozygous
for the T allele of a SNP at position 531. This allele exhibited highly
significant (P less than 0.001) overrepresentation in patients compared
with controls (with a T allele population frequency of 0.4), suggesting
that R114H might be an ancient founder mutation.

.0002
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
TREX1, ARG164TER

In a patient with Cree encephalitis, also known as AGS1 (225750), born
of consanguineous parents, Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous
490C-T transition in the TREX1 gene, resulting in an arg164-to-ter
(R164X) substitution. A lymphoblastoid cell line derived from the
patient showed no detectable 3-prime exonuclease activity. The findings
confirmed that Cree encephalitis and AGS1 are essentially the same
disorder.

.0003
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
TREX1, 3-BP INS, 600GAT

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with AGS1 (225750), Crow et
al. (2006) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
TREX1 gene: a 3-bp insertion (600insGAT), resulting in duplication of an
aspartate residue involved in divalent cation binding within the
catalytic site, and R114H (606609.0001).

.0004
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1
TREX1, VAL201ASP

In a patient with AGS1 (225750), born of consanguineous Turkish parents,
Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous 602T-A transversion in the
TREX1 gene, resulting in a val201-to-asp (V201D) substitution in the
catalytic site of the protein. Patient-derived fibroblasts showed no
detectable TREX1 3-prime exonuclease activity.

.0005
CHILBLAIN LUPUS
TREX1, 1-BP DUP, 375T

In a nonconsanguineous Bangladeshi family, Rice et al. (2007) found
association between chilblain lupus (610448) and a heterozygous mutation
in the TREX1 gene, the duplication of a single base (375dupT) that
resulted in a truncated protein missing the last 188 amino acids. The
mutation was present in 3 affected sibs; it was found also in a fourth
sib with a subclinical phenotype.

.0006
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
TREX1, ASP200ASN

In a child with a classic history of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
(225750), born to nonconsanguineous Scottish parents, Rice et al. (2007)
found heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the TREX1 gene: a 598G-A
transition that resulted in a substitution of asparagine for aspartic
acid at codon 200 (D200N). Both parents had a homozygous wildtype
genotype at this position, suggesting a de novo occurrence.
Differentiation of the maternal and paternal alleles was possible
because of a frequently observed C-to-T SNP at position 531, which
allowed the authors to demonstrate that the mutation has arisen on the
maternal allele. A standard exonuclease assay indicated close-to-normal
TREX1 enzymatic activity. Rice et al. (2007) hypothesized that the
aspartic acid at position 200 of TREX1 represents one of 4 residues
essential for coordinating 2 magnesium ions involved in DNA binding and
catalysis, and that the D200N mutation represents a gain-of-function
mutation conferring altered substrate specificity, DNA binding, or
protein-protein interaction which would not be detected in a standard
TREX1 exonuclease assay.

Fye et al. (2011) stated that asp18 and asp200 are the 2 aspartates that
coordinate the divalent metal ion Mg(2+) at the TREX1 active site and
contribute to DNA binding and catalysis. They found that homodimers of
recombinant human TREX1 containing D200N or D18N (606609.0007) mutations
had negligible nuclease activity against ssDNA and dsDNA compared with
wildtype. Heterodimers of wildtype TREX1 with D18N or D200N TREX1
mutants had more modestly reduced ssDNA nuclease activity, but
profoundly reduced dsDNA nuclease activity, compared with wildtype
homodimers. Fye et al. (2011) concluded that the dominant phenotypes of
asp18 and asp200 mutations relate predominantly to impaired dsDNA
degradation and indicate that TREX1 dsDNA degradation activity is
fundamental to the prevention of autoimmunity.

.0007
CHILBLAIN LUPUS
AICARDI-GOUTIERES SYNDROME 1, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, INCLUDED
TREX1, ASP18ASN

In affected members of the large 5-generation German family with
chilblain lupus (610448) previously described by Lee-Kirsch et al.
(2006), Lee-Kirsch et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 52G-A
transversion in exon 1 of the TREX1 gene, resulting in an asp18-to-asn
(D18N) substitution at a highly conserved residue critical for catalytic
activity. The mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in
400 control chromosomes. Recombinant mutant TREX1 homodimers were
enzymatically inactive, whereas mutant/wildtype heterodimers had
approximately 40% of the activity of wildtype dimers, indicating that
D18N is a loss-of-function allele that does not exhibit a
dominant-negative effect. Compared to control cells, patient-derived
lymphoblastoid cells were substantially less sensitive to cell death
after treatment with granzyme A (GZMA; 140050) but not granzyme B (GZMB;
123910), indicating that D18N specifically interferes with GZMA-mediated
cell death in the caspase-independent form of apoptosis.

In a 16-year-old girl with relatively mild Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome
(AGS1; 225750), who was negative for mutation in other known AGS genes,
Haaxma et al. (2010) identified a de novo heterozygous D18N missense
mutation in the TREX1 gene. The mutation was not found in either parent
or in 200 control chromosomes. The patient also displayed features of
mitochondrial disease, with cytochrome oxidase-negative and ragged-red
fibers seen on histologic examination of the quadriceps muscle;
biochemical measurements showed decreased overall energy production (ATP
and CrP) in the presence of normal activities of individual respiratory
chain complexes, again compatible with mitochondrial dysfunction.
However, heteroduplex analysis of the entire mitochondrial DNA did not
show any mutations. This patient also had peripheral neuropathy with
prominent axonal loss and disturbances of myelination without strict
demyelination.

Fye et al. (2011) stated that asp18 and asp200 are the 2 aspartates that
coordinate the divalent metal ion Mg(2+) at the TREX1 active site and
contribute to DNA binding and catalysis. They found that homodimers of
recombinant human TREX1 containing D200N (60609.0006) or D18N mutations
had negligible nuclease activity against ssDNA and dsDNA compared with
wildtype. Heterodimers of wildtype TREX1 with D18N or D200N TREX1
mutants had more modestly reduced ssDNA nuclease activity, but
profoundly reduced dsDNA nuclease activity, compared with wildtype
homodimers. Fye et al. (2011) concluded that the dominant phenotypes of
asp18 and asp200 mutations relates predominantly to impaired dsDNA
degradation and indicates that TREX1 dsDNA degradation activity is
fundamental to the prevention of autoimmunity.

.0008
VASCULOPATHY, RETINAL, WITH CEREBRAL LEUKODYSTROPHY
TREX1, 1-BP INS, 3688G

In 5 families with autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy with cerebral
leukodystrophy (192315), including 2 North American families previously
reported by Grand et al. (1988) and 1 Dutch pedigree originally
described by Storimans et al. (1991), Richards et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (3688G) at the C terminus of the
TREX1 gene, resulting in a frameshift at val235 (V235fs). Haplotype
analysis suggested that these families were not related. The mutation
was not found in 192 Caucasian, 192 Chinese, or 300 Dutch control
alleles. In expression studies, the truncated protein retained
exonuclease activity but lost normal perinuclear localization.

.0009
VASCULOPATHY, RETINAL, WITH CEREBRAL LEUKODYSTROPHY
TREX1, 4-BP DUP, 3727GTCA

In a North American family of Chinese ancestry with autosomal dominant
retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (192315), previously
reported by Jen et al. (1997), Richards et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 4-bp duplication (3727dupGTCA) at the C terminus of
the TREX1 gene, resulting in a frameshift at thr249 (T249fs). The
mutation was not found in 192 Caucasian, 192 Chinese, or 300 Dutch

exonuclease activity but lost normal perinuclear localization.
