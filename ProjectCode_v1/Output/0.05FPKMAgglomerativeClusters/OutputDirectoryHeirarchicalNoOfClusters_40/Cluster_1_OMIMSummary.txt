CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 61; C10ORF61
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to TCTN1 (609863), Reiter
and Skarnes (2006) identified mouse and human TCTN2 (613846) and TCTN3.
The deduced mouse Tctn3 protein contains 595 amino acids. It has an
N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal transmembrane domain that is
conserved in Drosophila tectonic.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the TCTN3 gene to chromosome 10q24.1 based on an
alignment of the TCTN3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL050022) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 fetuses from 5 consanguineous families with orofaciodigital
syndrome IV (OFD4; 258860), Thomas et al. (2012) identified homozygosity
or compound heterozygosity for truncating mutations in the TCTN3 gene
(613847.0001-613847.0005). Analysis of TCTN3 in a Turkish family with
Joubert syndrome mapping to chromosome 10 (JBTS18; 614815) revealed
homozygosity for a missense mutation (613847.0006) in the 2 affected
sibs. Functional analysis indicated that TCTN3 is necessary for
transduction of the SHH (600725) signaling pathway, as revealed by
abnormal processing of GLI3 (165240) in patient cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OROFACIODIGITAL SYNDROME IV
TCTN3, GLN480TER

In a fetus with orofaciodigital syndrome IV (OFD4; 258860) from a
consanguineous Senegalese family, Thomas et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for a 1222C-T transition in exon 11 of the TCTN3 gene,
resulting in a gln408-to-ter (Q408X) substitution. Patient fibroblasts
displayed negligible responsiveness to SHH (600725) agonists compared to
controls, and mutant fibroblasts exhibited decreased amounts of
full-length unprocessed GLI3 (165240), a transcriptional target of SHH
signaling, and increased amounts of the cleaved repressor form (GLI3R),
indicating that TCTN3 is essential for GLI3 processing and function.
Thomas et al. (2012) concluded that at least some of the defects in
affected individuals with TCTN3 mutations may be secondary to reduced
SHH signaling.

In 2 fetuses with orofaciodigital syndrome IV (OFD4; 258860) from 2
unrelated consanguineous Pakistani families, Thomas et al. (2012)
identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (650_653del) in exon 5 of
the TCTN3 gene, predicted to cause a frameshift resulting in premature
termination (Tyr217SerfsTer6). The mutation segregated in all available
family members from both families with the expected patterns of
autosomal recessive inheritance.

homozygosity for a 1327C-T transition in exon 12 of the TCTN3 gene,
resulting in a gln443-to-ter (Q443X) substitution. The mutation

heterozygosity for a 2-bp deletion (566_567del) in exon 4 of the TCTN3
gene (Glu189Valfs*52), and a 2-bp deletion (1348_1349del; 613847.0005)

300429	TITLE *300429 RHO GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 9; ARHGEF9
;;PEM2;;
COLLYBISTIN;;
KIAA0424
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ARHGEF9 gene encodes collybistin, a brain-specific guanine
nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that belongs to a family of Rho-like
GTPases that act as molecular switches by cycling from the active
GTP-bound state to the inactive GDP-bound state. Collybistin has a
pivotal role in the formation of postsynaptic glycine and inhibitory
gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor clusters (summary by Shimojima et al.,
2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned ARHGEF9, which they designated
KIAA0424. The deduced 516-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 58 kD. ARHGEF9 shares 22% identity with the DBL oncogene
(311030).

Reid et al. (1999) further characterized ARHGEF9, which they called
PEM2. ARHGEF9 contains an N-terminal SRC homology 3 (SH3) domain,
followed by tandem DBL homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH)
domains and a C-terminal proline-rich sequence. Northern blot analysis
detected a transcript of about 6 kb expressed almost exclusively in
brain. ARHGEF9, expressed in COS-7 cells, showed an apparent molecular
mass of about 70 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis of ARHGEF9 expressed in COS-7 cells, Reid et al.
(1999) found the ARHGEF9 specifically activates CDC42 (116952) and not
Rac (602048) or RhoA (165390). Ectopic expression in mouse fibroblasts
revealed a Cdc42 phenotype featuring filopodia formation, followed by
cortical actin polymerization and cell rounding.

Using in vitro pull-down assays and yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Grosskreutz
et al. (2001) found that polar amino acids between the SH3 and DH
domains of rat Arhgef9, which they called collybistin, interacted with
gephyrin (603930). In vitro, gephyrin bound simultaneously to Arhgef9
and to a glycine receptor beta subunit (138492) peptide. Grosskreutz et
al. (2001) hypothesized that ARHGEF9-gephyrin interactions occur during
inhibitory postsynaptic membrane formation.

Harvey et al. (2004) characterized several new variants of collybistin,
which are created by alternative splicing of exons encoding an
N-terminal src homology-3 (SH3) domain and 3 alternate C termini (CB1,
CB2, and CB3). They localized the binding sites for collybistin and the
beta subunit of the glycine receptor (GLRE; 138492) to the C-terminal
MoeA homology domain of gephyrin (GPHN; 603930) and showed that
multimerization of this domain is required for collybistin-gephyrin and
GlyR-gephyrin interactions. They also demonstrated that gephyrin
clustering in recombinant systems and cultured neurons requires both
collybistin-gephyrin interactions and an intact collybistin pleckstrin
homology domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Harvey et al. (2004) determined that the ARHGEF9 gene consists of 10
exons distributed over approximately 190 kb.

Shimojima et al. (2011) stated that the ARHGEF9 gene contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the ARHGEF9
gene to the X chromosome. By genomic sequence analysis, Reid et al.
(1999) mapped the ARHGEF9 gene to a position 145 cR from the top of
chromosome X.

Harvey et al. (2004) stated that the ARHGEF9 gene maps to chromosome
Xq22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The vital importance of collybistin for inhibitory synaptogenesis was
underlined by the discovery by Harvey et al. (2004) of a mutation (G55A;
300429.0001) in exon 2 of the ARHGEF9 gene in a patient with clinical
symptoms of both hyperekplexia and early infantile epileptic
encephalopathy (EIEE8; 300607). Harvey et al. (2004) suggested that the
clinical manifestations of this ARHGEF9 missense mutation may result, at
least in part, from mislocalization of gephyrin and a major GABA(A)
receptor subtype.

In 1 of 23 boys with mental retardation, Shimojima et al. (2011)
identified a loss-of-function mutation in the ARHGEF9 gene (Q2X;
300429.0002). The patient had refractory seizures, right frontal
polymicrogyria, and severe psychomotor retardation.

CYTOGENETICS

Marco et al. (2008) reported a girl with mental retardation and sensory
hyperarousal associated with a balanced de novo paracentric inversion
(X)(q11.1;q27.3) that disrupted 1 allele of the ARHGEF9 gene between
exons 1 and 3. At age 18 months, she showed hyperarousal to noise and
social situations as well as global developmental delay. The
hyperarousal severely limited her activities and family life. As a teen,
other features included slightly dysarthric speech, difficulty with
smooth eye pursuit, mild bilateral lower extremity spasticity with brisk
reflexes and extensor plantar responses, and wide-based gait. Laboratory
studies showed completely skewed X inactivation in favor of the abnormal
X chromosome and decreased ARHGEF9 mRNA at 9% of control levels.

Shimojima et al. (2011) reported a 5-year-old boy with severely delayed
psychomotor development and seizures who had a de novo 737-kb deletion
of Xq11.1 including the ARHGEF9, SPIN4, and LOC92249 genes. His seizures
began at age 2 years, were well-controlled, and were of complex-partial
type. EEG showed separate spikes at the temporal regions. He also showed
generalized overgrowth and trigonocephaly, but no other dysmorphic
features.

Lesca et al. (2011) reported a 6-year-old boy with profound mental
retardation associated with a de novo 1.29-Mb deletion of Xq11.11
including the ARHGEF9 gene. He showed delayed psychomotor development in
infancy and presented at age 5 months with episodes of neurologic
distress, including loss of consciousness, hypotonia, cyanosis, and
turning of the head. The seizures were controlled, but worsened after
withdrawal of treatment at age 4 years, at which point he developed
nocturnal seizures with secondary generalization. At age 6, he showed
generalized overgrowth (weight, height, and head circumference all +3
SD), and had mild dysmorphic features, including pectus excavatum,
enlarged ear lobes, prominent nasal bridge, and small mouth with
prognathia. He had hyperactivity with attention deficit and limited
social interaction, but had no intolerance of loud noises and no
hyperarousal. Array CGH analysis identified a deletion including the
ARHGEF9, SPIN4, and LOC92249 genes, as well as 3 putative gene
sequences.

ANIMAL MODEL

Papadopoulos et al. (2007) found that Arhgef9-null mice had brain
region-specific loss of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters in the
hippocampus, the basolateral amygdala, parts of the thalamus, and the
cerebellum, although the overall expression levels of synaptic proteins
in the central nervous system were similar to wildtype. These findings
suggested a redistribution of postsynaptic proteins. Mutant mice also
had decreased postsynaptic levels of the GABA receptor subunit GABRG2
(137164) in the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus compared to
wildtype, and this was associated with decreased GABAergic transmission
and changes in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Mutant mice
showed increased anxiety and impaired spatial learning, but no changes
in locomotor behavior. Specifically, mutant mice did not exhibit tremor
or altered gait compared to wildtype mice. There was no effect on the
localization of glycine receptors.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 8
ARHGEF9, GLY55ALA

In a child with clinical features of both hyperekplexia and early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE8; 300607), Harvey et al. (2004)
demonstrated a gly55-to-ala (G55A) mutation that arose from a 164G-C
transversion in exon 2 of the ARHGEF9 gene. The conserved gly55 residue
is within the SH3 domain, and transfection studies in HEK293 cells
suggested that the G55A mutation disrupts SH3 domain structure and
function.

.0002
EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 8
ARHGEF9, GLN2TER

In a boy with early infantile encephalopathy-8 (300670), Shimojima et
al. (2011) identified a 4C-T transition in exon 1a of the ARHGEF9 gene,
resulting in a gln2-to-ter (Q2X) substitution. The mutation only affects
transcript variant 2, which is normally expressed in human fetal and
adult brain. His unaffected mother was heterozygous for the mutation,
which was not found in 100 control DNA samples. The patient had
psychomotor delay beginning in early infancy. He developed intractable
seizures at age 20 months, and EEG showed continuous spike and wave
patterns during sleep. Brain MRI showed right frontal polymicrogyria. At
age 5 years and 5 months, he had severe developmental delay, could not
speak, and was ataxic. Shimojima et al. (2011) postulated a
loss-of-function effect of the mutation.

encoding A-beta and G-beta, the beta subunits of A-SCS and G-SCS,
respectively. The predicted 395-amino acid human G-beta protein shares
89 to 94% identity with that of pigeon, mouse, and pig, and 38 to 48%
identity with the beta subunit of bacterial SCSs. Human A-beta and
G-beta are 53% identical. RT-PCR revealed that G-beta is widely
expressed. Although the level of G-beta mRNA appears to be lower than
that of A-beta in most human and mouse tissues, Johnson et al. (1998)
demonstrated that G-SCS was generally the predominant enzyme activity in
rat and mouse tissues.

;;RAB-LIKE, FORMERLY; RABL, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the Rab protein family are small GTPases of the Ras
superfamily that are thought to ensure fidelity in the process of
docking and/or fusion of vesicles with their correct acceptor
compartment (Han et al., 1996).

CLONING

Han et al. (1996) isolated fetal lung cDNAs encoding a RAB protein that
they designated RABL (RAB5-like). The predicted 216-amino acid RABL
protein shares 86% identity with RAB5A (179512) and RAB5B (179514) and
contains the conserved GTP-binding site characteristic of RAS proteins.
RT-PCR analysis revealed that RABL is expressed ubiquitously.

MAPPING

By analysis of cloned segments, Albertsen et al. (1994) determined that
the RAB5C gene, which they called BC1-16, is located in the BRCA1
(113705) gene region on chromosome 17q12-q21. Han et al. (1996) refined
the map position to 17q21.2 using FISH.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a positional cloning strategy, Eisenberg et al. (2002) identified
a novel transcript in the critical region for IBM2 (600737) on
chromosome 9p13-p12. They cloned the full-length cDNA, designated
C9ORF19, from a human placenta cDNA library. C9ORF19 encodes a deduced
154-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 17.2 kD.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.9-kb transcript in most adult
tissues tested, with highest expression in lung and peripheral
leukocytes and minor expression in liver and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eisenberg et al. (2002) determined that the GLIPR2 gene contains 5 exons
and spans more than 27 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Shoji-Kawata et al. (2013) showed that a peptide, Tat-beclin-1, derived
from a region of the autophagy protein beclin-1 (604378), which binds
HIV-1 Nef, is a potent inducer of autophagy, and interacts with a
negative regulator of autophagy, GAPR1 (also called GLIPR2).
Tat-beclin-1 decreases the accumulation of polyglutamine expansion
protein aggregates and the replication of several pathogens, including
HIV-1, in vitro, and reduces mortality in mice infected with chikungunya
or West Nile virus. Shoji-Kawata et al. (2013) concluded that, through
the characterization of a domain of beclin-1 that interacts with HIV-1
Nef, they have developed an autophagy-inducing peptide that has
potential efficacy in the treatment of human diseases.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Eisenberg et al. (2002) mapped the GLIPR2 gene to
chromosome 9p13-p12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By mutation analysis in patients with IBM2, Eisenberg et al. (2002)
excluded C9ORF19 as the disease-causing gene.

;;CADHERIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, BETA; CTNNB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Beta-catenin is an adherens junction protein. Adherens junctions (AJs;
also called the zonula adherens) are critical for the establishment and
maintenance of epithelial layers, such as those lining organ surfaces.
AJs mediate adhesion between cells, communicate a signal that
neighboring cells are present, and anchor the actin cytoskeleton. In
serving these roles, AJs regulate normal cell growth and behavior. At
several stages of embryogenesis, wound healing, and tumor cell
metastasis, cells form and leave epithelia. This process, which involves
the disruption and reestablishment of epithelial cell-cell contacts, may
be regulated by the disassembly and assembly of AJs. AJs may also
function in the transmission of the 'contact inhibition' signal, which
instructs cells to stop dividing once an epithelial sheet is complete
(summary by Peifer, 1993).

CLONING

As reviewed by Peifer (1993), the AJ is a multiprotein complex assembled
around calcium-regulated cell adhesion molecules called cadherins (e.g.,
114020 and 114021). Cadherins are transmembrane proteins: the
extracellular domain mediates homotypic adhesion with cadherins on
neighboring cells, and the intracellular domain interacts with
cytoplasmic proteins that transmit the adhesion signal and anchor the AJ
to the actin cytoskeleton. These cytoplasmic proteins include the alpha-
(116805), beta-, and gamma-catenins. The beta-catenin gene, which was
cloned by McCrea et al. (1991), shows no similarity in sequence to the
genes for the alpha-catenins. The beta-catenin protein shares 70% amino
acid identity with both plakoglobin (173325), which is found in
desmosomes (another type of intracellular junction), and the product of
the Drosophila segment polarity gene 'armadillo.' Armadillo is part of a
multiprotein AJ complex in Drosophila that also includes some homologs
of alpha-catenin and cadherin, and genetic studies indicate that it is
required for cell adhesion and cytoskeletal integrity. The armadillo
gene was originally identified as one of a group of segment polarity
genes that regulate pattern formation of the Drosophila embryonic
cuticle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nollet et al. (1996) showed that the CTNNB1 gene has 16 exons and spans
23.2 kb. Alternative splicing within exon 16 produced a splice variant
that is 159-bp shorter in the 3-prime untranslated region. The promoter
region was shown to be GC-rich and to contain a TATA box. The authors
demonstrated promoter activity in mouse epithelial cells for the 5-prime
flanking region when it was linked to the reporter gene alkaline
phosphatase.

MAPPING

By FISH, Kraus et al. (1994) mapped the CTNNB1 gene to 3p21, a region
frequently affected by somatic alterations in a variety of tumors. Using
PCR primers for the genomic amplification of beta-catenin sequences on
the basis of homology to exon 4 of the Drosophila armadillo gene, they
analyzed a panel of somatic cell hybrids to confirm the localization of
the gene to human chromosome 3. Exclusion mapping of 3 hybrids carrying
defined fragments of 3p allowed them to determine that the CTNNB1 locus
is close to marker D3S2. Guenet et al. (1995) mapped the homologous
gene, symbolized Catnb by them, to mouse chromosome 9 by analysis of
interspecific backcrosses. Bailey et al. (1995) used FISH and PCR
analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs to show that the CTNNB1 gene is
located in the 3p22-p21 region. By FISH, van Hengel et al. (1995)
assigned CTNNB1 to 3p22-p21.3. Trent et al. (1995) likewise localized
the CTNNB1 gene to 3p22 by FISH. They stated that because APC-binding
proteins (like beta-catenin) represent a 'downstream' modulator of APC
activity, the chromosomal locus of such a protein might be expected to
be a site involved in chromosome rearrangements in malignancy.

GENE FUNCTION

Work by Korinek et al. (1997) and by Morin et al. (1997) established
that the APC gene (611731), which is mutant in adenomatous polyposis of
the colon, is a negative regulator of beta-catenin signaling. The APC
protein normally binds to beta-catenin, which interacts with Tcf and Lef
transcription factors. Korinek et al. (1997) cloned a gene, which they
called hTcf-4, that is a Tcf family member expressed in colonic
epithelium. The protein product (Tcf4) transactivates transcription only
when associated with beta-catenin. Nuclei of APC -/- colon carcinoma
cells were found to contain a stable beta-catenin/Tcf4 complex that was
constitutively active, as measured by transcription of a Tcf reporter
gene. Reintroduction of APC removed beta-catenin from Tcf4 and abrogated
the transcriptional activation. Korinek et al. (1997) concluded that
constitutive transcription of Tcf target genes, caused by loss of APC
function, may be a crucial event in the early transformation of colonic
epithelium. Morin et al. (1997) likewise found that the protein products
of mutant APC genes present in colorectal tumors were defective in
downregulating transcriptional activation mediated by beta-catenin and
T-cell transcription factor-4 (TCF4), now known as transcription
factor-7-like-2 (TCF7L2; 602228). Furthermore, colorectal tumors with
intact APC genes were found to contain activating mutations of
beta-catenin that altered functionally significant phosphorylation
sites. These results indicated that regulation of beta-catenin is
critical to the tumor suppressive effect of APC and that this regulation
can be circumvented by mutations in either APC or beta-catenin.

Roose et al. (1999) demonstrated in mice that one of the targets of the
beta-catenin/TCF7L2 interactions in epithelial cells is TCF7 (189908).
Roose et al. (1999) suggested that TCF7 may act as a feedback repressor
of beta-catenin/TCF7L2 target genes, and thus may cooperate with APC to
suppress malignant transformation of epithelial cells.

Rodova et al. (2002) presented evidence for beta-catenin-induced
expression of PKD1 (601313). They analyzed the promoter region of PKD1
and identified numerous transactivating factors, including 4 TCF-binding
elements (TBEs). Beta-catenin induced a reporter construct containing
TBE1 6-fold when cotransfected into HEK293T cells, which express TCF4
(TCF7L2). Dominant-negative TCF4 or deletion of the TBE1 sequence
inhibited the induction. Gel shift assays confirmed that TCF4 and
beta-catenin could complex with the TBE1 site, and HeLa cells stably
transfected with beta-catenin responded with elevated levels of
endogenous PKD1 mRNA. Rodova et al. (2002) concluded that the PKD1 gene
is a target of the beta-catenin/TCF pathway.

Van de Wetering et al. (2002) showed that disruption of
beta-catenin/TCF4 activity in colorectal cancer cells induced a rapid G1
arrest and blocked a genetic program that was physiologically active in
the proliferative compartment of colon crypts. Coincidently, an
intestinal differentiation program was induced. The TCF4 target gene MYC
(190080) played a central role in this switch by direct repression of
the CDKN1A (116899) promoter. Following disruption of beta-catenin/TCF4
activity, the decreased expression of MYC released CDKN1A transcription,
which in turn mediated G1 arrest and differentiation. The authors
concluded that the beta-catenin/TCF4 complex constitutes the master
switch that controls proliferation versus differentiation in healthy and
malignant intestinal epithelial cells.

Glucuronic acid epimerase (GLCE; 612134) is responsible for
epimerization of D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) to L-iduronic acid (IdoA) of
the cell surface polysaccharide heparan sulfate (HS), endowing the
nascent HS polysaccharide chain with the ability to bind growth factors
and cytokines. Using stepwise deletion and site-directed mutagenesis,
Ghiselli and Agrawal (2005) identified 2 cis-acting binding elements for
the beta-catenin-TCF4 complex in the enhancer region of the GLCE
promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift analyses
confirmed binding of beta-catenin-TCF4 to these sequences of GLCE. GLCE
expression in human colon carcinoma cell lines correlated with the
degree of activation of the beta-catenin-TCF4 transactivation complex.
Furthermore, ectopic expression of beta-catenin-TCF4 increased the GLCE
transcript level and enhanced the rate of GlcA epimerization in HS.
Ghiselli and Agrawal (2005) concluded that the beta-catenin-TCF4
transactivation pathway plays a major role in modulating GLCE
expression, thus contributing to regulation of HS biosynthesis and its
structural organization.

Batlle et al. (2002) showed that beta-catenin and TCF inversely control
the expression of the EphB2 (600997)/EphB3 (601839) receptors and their
ligand, ephrin B1 (EFNB1; 300035), in colorectal cancer and along the
crypt-villus axis. Disruption of EphB2 and EphB3 genes revealed that
their gene products restrict cell intermingling and allocate cell
populations within the intestinal epithelium. In EphB2/EphB3 null mice,
the proliferative and differentiated populations intermingled. In adult
EphB3 -/- mice, Paneth cells did not follow their downward migratory
path, but scattered along crypt and villus. The authors concluded that,
in the intestinal epithelium, beta-catenin and TCF couple proliferation
and differentiation to the sorting of cell populations through the
EphB/ephrin B system.

Kawasaki et al. (2000) cloned a gene, ASEF (605216), whose protein
product interacts directly with APC (611731). ASEF immunoprecipitates
with beta-catenin; however, ASEF and beta-catenin do not interact
directly, suggesting that ASEF, APC, and beta-catenin are found in the
same complex in vivo. Kawasaki et al. (2000) suggested that the APC-ASEF
complex may regulate the actin cytoskeletal network, cell morphology and
migration, and neuronal function.

In addition to the inhibition of ubiquitination (see BTRC, 603482) of
phosphorylated IKBA (164008), Neish et al. (2000) observed that
phosphorylated CTNNB1 is not ubiquitinated in epithelial cells exposed
to avirulent Salmonella.

Eastman and Grosschedl (1999) reviewed progress in understanding of how
the activities of both beta-catenin and LEF1/TCF (153245) proteins are
regulated. They summarized the interactions of beta-catenin and LEF1/TCF
proteins, including a discussion of how cellular events can influence
the stability of beta-catenin and its availability for association with
LEF1/TCF proteins. Eastman and Grosschedl (1999) also discussed factors
that influence beta-catenin activity independent of a Wnt signal.

Kang et al. (2002) showed that presenilin-1 (PS1; 104311) functions as a
scaffold that rapidly couples beta-catenin phosphorylation through 2
sequential kinase activities independent of the Wnt-regulated axin
(603816)/CK1-alpha (600505) complex. Presenilin deficiency resulted in
increased beta-catenin stability in vitro and in vivo by disconnecting
the stepwise phosphorylation of beta-catenin, both in the presence and
absence of Wnt stimulation. These findings highlighted an aspect of
beta-catenin regulation outside of the canonical Wnt-regulated pathway
and a function of presenilin separate from intramembrane proteolysis.

Murase et al. (2002) transfected fluorescence-tagged chick beta-catenin
into rat hippocampal neurons in culture. They found that, upon
depolarization, beta-catenin moved from dendritic shafts into spines and
increased its association with cadherins. This redistribution of
beta-catenin was mimicked by addition of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and
prevented by addition of a phosphatase inhibitor. Transfection with a
chick beta-catenin carrying a phosphorylation-preventing mutation of
tyr654 (tyr654 to phe; Y654F) resulted in concentration of beta-catenin
within spines, whereas transfection with a phosphorylation-mimicking
mutation (tyr654 to glu; Y654E) resulted in beta-catenin accumulation in
dendritic shafts. The Y654F-expressing neurons also exhibited a higher
minifrequency and larger Psd95 (602887) and synapsin-1 (313440) clusters
within synaptic spines.

Tetsu and McCormick (1999) showed that beta-catenin activated
transcription from the cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461) promoter. They
identified promoter sequences related to consensus TCF/LEF-binding sites
that were necessary for activation. p21 RAS (see 190020) further
activated transcription of the cyclin D1 gene through sites within the
promoter that bind the transcriptional regulators ETS (see 164720) or
CREB (CREB1; 123810). Cells expressing mutant beta-catenin produced high
levels of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein. Furthermore, expression of a
dominant-negative form of TCF in colon cancer cells inhibited expression
of cyclin D1 without affecting expression of other cyclins or
cyclin-dependent kinases and caused cells to arrest in G1.

Lin et al. (2000) demonstrated that CCND1 is one of the targets of
beta-catenin in breast cancer (114480) cells. They found that high
beta-catenin activity correlated with poor patient prognosis and was a
strong and independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. These studies
indicated that beta-catenin can be involved in breast cancer formation
and/or progression and may serve as a target for breast cancer therapy.

Van Aken et al. (2002) studied the cadherin-catenin complex in
retinoblastoma and normal retina tissues. In both cases, they found that
N-cadherin (114020) was associated with alpha- and beta-catenin but not
with E- or P-cadherin. Moreover, retinoblastoma cells, in contrast with
normal retina, expressed an N-cadherin/catenin complex that was
irregularly distributed and weakly linked to the cytoskeleton. In
retinoblastoma, this complex acted as an invasion promoter.

Widlund et al. (2002) identified beta-catenin as a significant regulator
of melanoma cell growth, with MITF (156845) as a critical downstream
target. Disruption of the canonical Wnt pathway abrogated growth of
melanoma cells, and constitutive overexpression of MITF rescued the
growth suppression.

The morphogenesis of organs as diverse as lungs, teeth, and hair
follicles is initiated by a downgrowth from a layer of epithelial stem
cells. During follicular morphogenesis, stem cells form this bud
structure by changing their polarity and cell-to-cell contact. Jamora et
al. (2003) showed that this process is achieved through simultaneous
receipt of 2 external signals: a WNT protein (WNT3A; 606359) to
stabilize beta-catenin, and a bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor
(Noggin; 602991) to produce Lef1. Beta-catenin then binds to and
activates Lef1 transcription complexes that appear to act
uncharacteristically by downregulating the gene encoding E-cadherin
(192090), an important component of polarity and intercellular adhesion.
When either signal is missing, functional Lef1 complexes are not made,
and E-cadherin downregulation and follicle morphogenesis are impaired.
In Drosophila, E-cadherin can influence the plane of cell division and
cytoskeletal dynamics. Consistent with this notion, Jamora et al. (2003)
showed that forced elevation of E-cadherin levels block invagination and
follicle production. Jamora et al. (2003) concluded that their findings
reveal an intricate molecular program that links 2 extracellular
signaling pathways to the formation of a nuclear transcription factor
that acts on target genes to remodel cellular junctions and permit
follicle formation.

Jarvinen et al. (2006) found that expression of a stabilized form of
beta-catenin in embryonic mouse oral and dental epithelium led to tooth
buds that gave rise to dozens of teeth. The molar crowns, however, were
typically simplified unicusped cones. Supernumerary teeth developed by a
renewal process where new signaling centers, the enamel knots, budded
off from the existing dental epithelium.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to renew themselves and
to give rise to all lineages of the blood. Reya et al. (2003) showed
that the WNT signaling pathway has an important role in this process.
Overexpression of activated beta-catenin expands the pool of HSCs in
long-term cultures by both phenotype and function. Furthermore, HSCs in
their normal microenvironment activate a LEF1/TCF reporter, which
indicates that HSCs respond to WNT signaling in vivo. To demonstrate the
physiologic significance of this pathway for HSC proliferation, Reya et
al. (2003) showed that the ectopic expression of axin or a frizzled
(603408) ligand-binding domain, inhibitors of the WNT signaling pathway,
led to inhibition of HSC growth in vitro and reduced reconstitution in
vivo. Furthermore, activation of WNT signaling in HSCs induced increased
expression of HOXB4 (142965) and NOTCH1 (190198), genes previously
implicated in self-renewal of HSCs. Reya et al. (2003) concluded that
the WNT signaling pathway is critical for normal HSC homeostasis in
vitro and in vivo, and provide insight into a potential molecular
hierarchy of regulation of HSC development.

In rat hippocampal neuronal cultures, Yu and Malenka (2003) found that
increasing the intracellular levels of beta-catenin enhanced dendritic
arborization. Although the effect did not require
WNT-beta-catenin-dependent transcription, WNT was involved in enhanced
dendritic arborization resulting from depolarization. Proteins that
sequestered beta-catenin decreased dendritic branch tip number and total
dendritic branch length. Yu and Malenka (2003) concluded that
beta-catenin is a mediator of dendritic development.

To test whether nuclear translocation of beta-catenin is involved in
axial identity and/or germ layer formation in 'pre-bilaterians,'
Wikramanayake et al. (2003) examined the in vivo distribution,
stability, and function of beta-catenin protein in embryos of the sea
anemone Nematostella vectensis. Wikramanayake et al. (2003) found that
N. vectensis beta-catenin is differentially stabilized along the
oral-aboral axis, translocated into nuclei in cells at the site of
gastrulation, and used to specify ectoderm, indicating an evolutionarily
ancient role for this protein in early pattern formation.

Lee et al. (2004) demonstrated that WNT/beta-catenin signal activation
in emigrating mouse neural crest stem cells had little effect on the
population size and instead regulated fate decisions. Sustained
beta-catenin activity in neural crest cells promoted the formation of
sensory neural cells in vivo at the expense of virtually all other
neural crest derivatives. Moreover, Lee et al. (2004) demonstrated that
WNT is able to instruct early neural crest stem cells to adopt a sensory
neuronal fate in a beta-catenin-dependent manner. Thus, Lee et al.
(2004) concluded that the role of WNT/beta-catenin in stem cells is
cell-type dependent.

Kleber et al. (2005) found that Bmp2 (112261) signaling antagonized the
sensory fate-inducing activity of Wnt/beta-catenin. Wnt and Bmp2 acted
synergistically to suppress differentiation and to maintain mouse neural
crest stem cell marker expression and multipotency.

Brembeck et al. (2004) found that BCL9-2 (BCL9L; 609004) was involved in
the switch between the adhesive and transcriptional functions of
beta-catenin. The switch was initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of
beta-catenin, which favored BCL9-2 binding and precluded interaction
with alpha-catenin.

By coimmunoprecipitation and tandem mass spectrometric analysis, Tian et
al. (2004) found that 14-3-3-zeta is a beta-catenin-interacting protein.
14-3-3-zeta enhanced beta-catenin-dependent transcription by stabilizing
beta-catenin in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, 14-3-3-zeta facilitated
activation of beta-catenin by AKT (see AKT1; 164730) and colocalized
with activated Akt in mouse intestinal stem cells. Tian et al. (2004)
proposed that AKT phosphorylates beta-catenin, leading to 14-3-3-zeta
binding and stabilization of beta catenin.

Guo et al. (2004) found that several Wnt genes, including Wnt4 (603490),
Wnt14 (602863), and Wnt16 (606267), were expressed in overlapping and
complementary patterns in developing mouse synovial joints, where Ctnnb1
protein level and transcription activity were upregulated. Removal of
Ctnnb1 early in mesenchymal progenitor cells promoted chondrocyte
differentiation and blocked the activity of Wnt14 in joint formation.
Ectopic expression of an activated form of Ctnnb1 or Wnt14 in early
differentiating chondrocytes induced ectopic joint formation both
morphologically and molecularly. In contrast, genetic removal of Ctnnb1
in chondrocytes led to joint fusion. Guo et al. (2004) concluded that
the Wnt/CTNNB1 signaling pathway is necessary and sufficient to induce
early steps of synovial joint formation, and they suggested that WNT4,
WNT14, and WNT16 may play redundant roles in synovial joint induction by
signaling through the CTNNB1-mediated canonical Wnt pathway.

Kaplan et al. (2004) found that, in addition to its roles in cell-cell
adhesion and Wnt-stimulated transcriptional activation, beta-catenin has
a role in establishing bipolar mitotic spindles. During mitosis in mouse
fibroblasts and HeLa cells, beta-catenin relocalized to mitotic spindle
poles and to the midbody. Biochemical fractionation demonstrated the
presence of beta-catenin in purified centrosome preparations. Reduction
of beta-catenin by RNA interference led to failure of centrosomes to
fully separate, resulting in a marked increase in the frequency of
monoastral mitotic spindles.

Kim et al. (2005) reported that the downregulation of a metastasis
suppressor gene, KAI1 (600623), in prostate cancer cells involves the
inhibitory actions of beta-catenin, along with a reptin (TIP48; 604788)
chromatin remodeling complex. This inhibitory function of
beta-catenin-reptin requires both increased beta-catenin expression and
recruitment of histone deacetylase activity. The coordinated actions of
beta-catenin-reptin components that mediate the repressive state serve
to antagonize a TIP60 (601409) coactivator complex that is required for
activation; the balance of these opposing complexes controls the
expression of KAI1 and metastatic potential. Kim et al. (2005) concluded
that the molecular mechanisms underlying the antagonistic regulation of
beta-catenin-reptin and the TIP60 coactivator complexes for the
metastasis suppressor gene, KAI1, are likely to be prototypic of a
selective downregulation strategy for many genes, including a subset of
NF-kappa-B (see 164011) target genes.

Essers et al. (2005) reported an evolutionarily conserved interaction of
beta-catenin with FOXO transcription factors (e.g., 602681), which are
regulated by insulin and oxidative stress signaling. In mammalian cells,
beta-catenin binds directly to FOXO and enhances FOXO transcriptional
activity. In C. elegans, loss of the beta-catenin BAR1 reduces the
activity of the FOXO ortholog DAF16 in dauer formation and life span.
Association of beta-catenin with FOXO was enhanced in cells exposed to
oxidative stress. Furthermore, BAR1 was required for the oxidative
stress-induced expression of the DAF16 target gene sod3 and for
resistance to oxidative damage. Essers et al. (2005) concluded that
their results demonstrated a role for beta-catenin in regulating FOXO
function that is particularly important under conditions of oxidative
stress.

Shah et al. (2006) stated that the signaling and oncogenic activity of
beta-catenin can be repressed by activation of vitamin D receptor (VDR;
601769). Conversely, high levels of beta-catenin can potentiate the
transcriptional activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Shah et al. (2006)
showed that the effects of beta-catenin on VDR activity are due
interaction between the activator function-2 domain of VDR and the C
terminus of beta-catenin.

Noubissi et al. (2006) demonstrated that beta-catenin stabilizes the
mRNA encoding the F-box protein beta-TrCP1 (BTRCP1; 603482), and
identified the RNA-binding protein CRDBP (608288) as a target of beta
catenin/Tcf transcription factor. CRDBP binds to the coding region of
BTRCP1 mRNA. Overexpression of CRDBP stabilized BTRCP1 mRNA and elevated
BTRCP1 levels both in cells and in vivo, resulting in the activation of
the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF)-BTRCP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and in
accelerated turnover of its substrates including I-kappa-B (see 164008)
and beta-catenin. CRDBP is essential for the induction of both BTRCP1
and c-Myc (190080) by beta-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer cells.
Noubissi et al. (2006) concluded that high levels of CRDBP that are
found in primary human colorectal tumors exhibiting active
beta-catenin/Tcf signaling implicates CRDBP induction in the
upregulation of BTRCP1, in the activation of dimeric transcription
factor NF-kappa-B, and in the suppression of apoptosis in these cancers.

Parakh et al. (2006) found that expression of beta-catenin lacking the
N-terminal 90-amino acids that lead to its degradation significantly
enhanced follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH; see 136350)-mediated
induction of CYP19A1 (107910) and CYP11A1 (118485) mRNA. CYP19A1
transactivation by SF1 (NR5A1; 601516) required a functional interaction
with beta-catenin and an intact beta-catenin-binding site. The
beta-catenin-binding site was also critical for the synergistic actions
of FSH and SF1 on CYP19A1. The actions of beta-catenin on CYP19A1 were
dependent on hormone-induced cAMP cascades. Parakh et al. (2006)
concluded that beta-catenin is essential for FSH/cAMP-regulated gene
expression in ovary and that beta-catenin has a role in estrogen
biosynthesis.

Moore et al. (2008) showed that epitope-tagged mammalian Mtgr1 (CBFA2T2;
603672), Mtg8 (RUNX1T1; 133435), and Mtg16 (CBFA2T3; 603870) interacted
with human TCF4 in cotransfected COS-7 cells. Beta-catenin disrupted
interaction of Mtg proteins with TCF4. When expressed in Xenopus
embryos, Mtg family members inhibited Wnt-dependent axis formation and
impaired the ability of beta-catenin or Lef1 to induce axis duplication.
Furthermore, Myc was overexpressed in the small intestine of mice
lacking Mtgr1. Moore et al. (2008) concluded that MTG proteins act
downstream of beta-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway.

Fungiform taste papillae form a regular array on the dorsal surface of
the tongue. Taste buds arise from papilla epithelium and, unusual for
epithelial derivatives, synapse with neurons, release neurotransmitters,
and generate receptor and action potentials. Liu et al. (2007)
demonstrated that Wnt-beta-catenin signaling is activated in developing
fungiform placodes and taste bud cells. They showed that a dominant
stabilizing mutation in epithelial beta-catenin causes massive
overproduction of enlarged fungiform papillae and taste buds. Likewise,
genetic deletion of epithelial beta-catenin or inhibition of
Wnt-beta-catenin signaling by ectopic dickkopf-1 (Dkk1; 605189) blocked
initiation of fungiform papilla morphogenesis. Ectopic papillae were
innervated in the stabilizing beta-catenin mutant, whereas ectopic Dkk1
caused absence of lingual epithelial innervation. Thus, Wnt-beta-catenin
signaling is critical for fungiform papilla and taste bud development.
Altered regulation of the pathway may underlie evolutionary changes in
taste papilla patterning.

Bahmanyar et al. (2008) found that stabilization of beta-catenin,
mimicking mutations found in cancer, induced centrosome splitting,
similar to ectopic NEK2 (604043) activation. They identified
beta-catenin as a substrate and binding partner for NEK2 in vitro and in
vivo and found that beta-catenin colocalized with the NEK2 substrates
rootletin (CROCC) and CNAP1 (CEP2; 609689) between centrosomes. CNAP1
and rootletin were required for localization of beta-catenin between
centrosomes in interphase, whereas beta-catenin had
rootletin-independent binding sites on chromosomes at mitotic spindle
poles. In response to ectopic expression of active NEK2 in interphase
cells, rootletin was reduced at interphase centrosomes and beta-catenin
localized to rootletin-independent sites on centrosomes, an event
required for centrosome separation in mitosis.

Continuous turnover of epithelia is ensured by the extensive
self-renewal capacity of tissue-specific stem cells. Similarly,
epithelial tumor maintenance relies on cancer stem cells, which co-opt
stem cell properties. In murine skin, follicular morphogenesis is driven
by bulge stem cells that specifically express CD34 (142230). Malanchi et
al. (2008) identified a population of cells in early epidermal tumors
characterized by phenotype and functional similarities to normal bulge
skin stem cells. This population contains cancer stem cells, which are
the only cells with tumor initiation properties. Transplants derived
from these cancer stem cells preserve the hierarchical organization of
the primary tumor. Malanchi et al. (2008) described beta-catenin
signaling as being essential in sustaining the cancer stem cell
phenotype. Ablation of the beta-catenin gene results in the loss of
cancer stem cells and complete tumor regression. In addition, Malanchi
et al. (2008) provided evidence for the involvement of increased
beta-catenin signaling in malignant human squamous cell carcinomas.
Malanchi et al. (2008) concluded that because Wnt/beta-catenin signaling
is not essential for normal epidermal homeostasis, such a mechanistic
difference may thus be targeted to eliminate cancer stem cells and
consequently eradicate squamous cell carcinomas.

To identify genes that both modulate beta-catenin activity and are
essential for colon cancer cell proliferation, Firestein et al. (2008)
conducted 2 loss-of-function screens in human colon cancer cells and
compared genes identified in these screens with an analysis of copy
number alterations in colon cancer specimens. One of these genes,
cyclin-dependent kinase-8 (CDK8; 603184), which encodes a member of the
mediator complex, is located at 13q12.13, a region of recurrent copy
number gain in a substantial fraction of colon cancers. Firestein et al.
(2008) showed that suppression of CDK8 expression inhibits proliferation
in colon cancer cells characterized by high levels of CDK8 and
beta-catenin hyperactivity. CDK8 kinase activity was necessary for
beta-catenin-driven transformation and for expression of several
beta-catenin transcriptional targets.

Morris et al. (2008) demonstrated that the transcription factor E2F1
(189971) is a potent and specific inhibitor of beta-catenin/T cell
factor (TCF)-dependent transcription and that this function contributes
to E2F1-induced apoptosis. E2F1 deregulation suppresses beta-catenin
activity in an APC (611731)/glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3; see
606784)-independent manner, reducing the expression of key beta-catenin
targets including c-MYC (190080). This interaction explains why
colorectal tumors, which depend on beta-catenin transcription for their
abnormal proliferation, keep RB1 (614041) intact. Remarkably, E2F1
activity is also repressed by CDK8, a colorectal oncoprotein. Elevated
levels of CDK8 protect beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription from
inhibition by E2F1. Morris et al. (2008) concluded that thus, by
retaining RB1 and amplifying CDK8, colorectal tumor cells select
conditions that collectively suppress E2F1 and enhance the activity of
beta-catenin.

Independently, Chassot et al. (2008) and Tomizuka et al. (2008) found
that knockout of Rspo1 (609595) in mice resulted in at least partial sex
reversal in females, but not males. Rspo1 was required for activation of
beta-catenin and Wnt4 signaling for female sex determination.

In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), beta-catenin is stabilized
constitutively, providing a permanent mitogenic signal to normally
resting cells. This occurs when the second allele of APC (611731) is
inactivated somatically. Kohler et al. (2009) described an APC domain,
the beta-catenin inhibitory domain (CID), that is located between the
second and third 20-amino acid beta-catenin-binding repeats and
therefore was present in many truncated APC products found in human
tumors. In truncated APC, the CID was absolutely necessary to
downregulate the transcriptional activity and the level of beta-catenin,
even when an axin/conductin binding site was present. The activity of
the CID was dramatically reduced in several colon cancer cell lines and
could be inhibited by shorter truncated APC lacking the CID. The authors
concluded that CID is a direct target of the selective pressure acting
on APC during tumorigenesis, and it explains the interdependence of both
APC mutations in colorectal, duodenal, and desmoid tumors.

Huang et al. (2009) used a chemical genetic screen to identify a small
molecule, XAV939, which selectively inhibits beta-catenin-mediated
transcription. XAV939 stimulates beta-catenin degradation by stabilizing
axin (603816), the concentration-limiting component of the destruction
complex. Using a quantitative chemical proteomic approach, Huang et al.
(2009) found that XAV939 stabilizes axin by inhibiting the
poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase-1 (603303) and tankyrase-2
(607128). Both tankyrase isoforms interact with a highly conserved
domain of axin and stimulate its degradation through the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Gattinoni et al. (2009) reported that induction of Wnt/beta-catenin
signaling by inhibitors of Gsk3b or by Wnt3a arrested mouse Cd8 (see
186910)-positive T-cell development into effector T cells capable of
cytotoxicity or Ifng (147570) production. Instead, Wnt signaling
promoted expression of Tcf7 and Lef1 and generation of self-renewing
multipotent Cd8-positive memory stem cells capable of proliferation and
antitumor activity. Gattinoni et al. (2009) concluded that Wnt signaling
has a key role in maintaining the self-renewing stem cell-like
properties of mature memory CD8-positive T cells.

Using RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis, Zhao et al. (2010)
demonstrated that mouse Tcf7 and Lef1 were highly expressed in naive T
cells, downregulated in effector T cells, and upregulated in memory T
cells. Memory Cd8-positive T cells expressing the p45 Tcf7 isoform and
beta-catenin had enhanced Il2 (147680) production capacity and enhanced
effector capacity to clear Listeria monocytogenes. Zhao et al. (2010)
concluded that constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway favors memory
CD8 T-cell formation during immunization, resulting in enhanced immunity
upon a second encounter with the same pathogen.

Using a genetic approach, Driessens et al. (2010) found no evidence that
the beta-catenin pathway regulates T-cell memory phenotype, in contrast
with the findings of Gattinoni et al. (2009). The findings of Driessens
et al. (2010) suggested that the generation of Cd8-positive memory stem
cells observed by Gattinoni et al. (2009) with the use of Gsk3b
inhibitors was not a consequence of activation of the beta-catenin
pathway, but was rather due activation of another Gsk3b-dependent
pathway. In a reply, Gattinoni et al. (2010) noted that others,
including Zhao et al. (2010) and Jeannet et al. (2010), had also
identified Wnt and beta-catenin as crucial factors in postthymic
Cd8-positive T-cell differentiation and memory development. Using
Western blot analysis, Gattinoni et al. (2010) showed that addition of
Wnt3a or Gsk3b inhibitor stabilized beta-catenin in primed Cd8-positive
mouse T cells.

Manicassamy et al. (2010) reported that the Wnt-beta-catenin signaling
in intestinal dendritic cells regulates the balance between inflammatory
versus regulatory responses in the gut. Beta-catenin in intestinal
dendritic cells was required for the expression of antiinflammatory
mediators such as retinoic acid metabolizing enzymes, interleukin-10
(124092), and transforming growth factor-beta (190180), and the
stimulation of regulatory T cell induction while suppressing
inflammatory effector T cells. Furthermore, ablation of beta-catenin
expression in dendritic cells enhanced inflammatory responses and
disease in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. This,
Manicassamy et al. (2010) concluded that beta-catenin signaling programs
dendritic cells to a tolerogenic state, limiting the inflammatory
response. Murphy (2011) commented that the deletion of beta-catenin in
macrophages remains a caveat to the interpretation of Manicassamy et al.
(2010) that Wnt signaling programs dendritic cells into a tolerogenic
state. Development of strains expressing Cre in a more finely
lineage-restricted pattern is necessary to resolve this issue.
Manicassamy and Pulendran (2011) responded that beta-catenin-deficient
dendritic cells are greatly impaired in inducing regulatory T cells, and
induce enhanced TH17/TH1 responses. They agreed that assessing the
relative importance of dendritic cells versus macrophages in intestinal
tolerance awaits tools that permit the genetic deletion of the numerous
dendritic cell and macrophage subsets in the intestine.

Yang et al. (2011) demonstrated in human cancer cells that EGFR (131550)
activation induces translocation of PKM2, but not PKM1 (see 179050),
into the nucleus, where K433 of PKM2 binds to c-Src-phosphorylated Y333
of beta-catenin. This interaction is required for both proteins to be
recruited to the CCND1 (168461) promoter, leading to HDAC3 (605166)
removal from the promoter, histone H3 acetylation, and cyclin D1
expression. PKM2-dependent beta-catenin transactivation is instrumental
in EGFR-promoted tumor cell proliferation and brain tumor development.
In addition, positive correlations were identified between c-Src
activity, beta-catenin Y333 phosphorylation, and PKM2 nuclear
accumulation in human glioblastoma specimens. Furthermore, levels of
beta-catenin phosphorylation and nuclear PKM2 were correlated with
grades of glioma malignancy and prognosis. Yang et al. (2011) concluded
that their findings revealed that EGF induces beta-catenin
transactivation via a mechanism distinct from that induced by
Wnt/Wingless and highlighted the essential nonmetabolic functions of
PKM2 in EGFR-promoted beta-catenin transactivation, cell proliferation,
and tumorigenesis.

Hoffmeyer et al. (2012) reported a molecular link between
Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and the expression of the telomerase subunit
Tert (187270). Beta-catenin-deficient mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells
have short telomeres; conversely, ES cells expressing an activated form
of beta-catenin (beta-catenin(deltaEx3/+)) have long telomeres.
Hoffmeyer et al. (2012) showed that beta-catenin regulates Tert
expression through the interaction with Klf4 (602253), a core component
of the pluripotency transcriptional network. Beta-catenin binds to the
Tert promoter in a mouse intestinal tumor model and in human carcinoma
cells. Hoffmeyer et al. (2012) uncovered a theretofore unknown link
between the stem cell and oncogenic potential whereby beta-catenin
regulates Tert expression, and thereby telomere length, which could be
critical in human regenerative therapy and cancer.

In mice, Takeo et al. (2013) showed that nail stem cells (NSCs) reside
in the proximal nail matrix and are defined by high expression of
keratin-14 (148066), keratin-17 (148069), and KI67 (MKI67; 176741). The
mechanisms governing NSC differentiation are coupled directly to their
ability to orchestrate digit regeneration. Early nail progenitors
undergo Wnt (see 164820)-dependent differentiation into the nail. After
amputation, this Wnt activation is required for nail regeneration and
also for attracting nerves that promote mesenchymal blastema growth,
leading to the regeneration of the digit. Amputations proximal to the
Wnt-active nail progenitors result in failure to regenerate the nail or
digit. Nevertheless, beta-catenin stabilization in the NSC region
induced their regeneration. Takeo et al. (2013) concluded that their
results established a link between nail stem cell differentiation and
digit regeneration, and suggested that NSCs may have the potential to
contribute to the development of novel treatments for amputees.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

In adherens junctions, alpha-catenin links the cadherin/beta-catenin
complex to the actin-based cytoskeleton. Alpha-catenin is a homodimer in
solution, but forms a 1:1 heterodimer with beta-catenin. Pokutta and
Weis (2000) determined the crystal structure of the alpha-catenin
dimerization domain, residues 82 to 279. The crystal structure showed
that alpha-catenin dimerizes through formation of a 4-helix bundle in
which 2 antiparallel helices are contributed by each protomer. A
slightly larger fragment, containing residues 57 to 264, binds to
beta-catenin. The crystal structure of a chimera consisting of the
alpha-catenin-binding region of beta-catenin linked to the N terminus of
alpha-catenin residues 57 to 264 revealed the interaction between alpha-
and beta-catenin and provided a basis for understanding adherens
junction assembly.

Graham et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure at 2.5-angstrom
resolution of a complex between CTNNB1 and ICAT (607758), a protein that
prevents interaction between CTNNB1 and TCF/LEF family transcription
factors. ICAT contains a 3-helix bundle that binds armadillo repeats 10
to 12 and a C-terminal tail that, like TCF and E-cadherin, binds in the
groove formed by armadillo repeats 5 to 9 of CTNNB1. Graham et al.
(2002) showed that ICAT selectively inhibits CTNNB1/TCF binding in vivo,
without disrupting CTNNB1/cadherin interactions. They concluded that it
should be possible to design cancer therapeutics that inhibit
CTNNB1-mediated transcriptional activation without interfering with cell
adhesion.

Daniels and Weis (2002) determined the crystal structure of ICAT bound
to the armadillo repeat domain of CTNNB1. ICAT contains an N-terminal
helical domain that binds to repeats 11 and 12 of CTNNB1, and an
extended C-terminal region that binds to repeats 5 to 10 in a manner
similar to that of TCFs and other CTNNB1 ligands.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mental Retardation, Autosomal Dominant 19

In 3 patients with severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, and
spasticity, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified heterozygous
loss-of-function mutations in the CTNNB1 gene (116806.0017-116806.0019).
Two of the mutations were known to be de novo; in the third patient, the
mutation was not inherited from the mother and the father's DNA was not
available for testing.

- Somatic Mutations

Morin et al. (1997) found a total of 3 tumors that contained CTNNB1
mutations that altered potential phosphorylation sites. Each mutation
was somatic and appeared to affect only 1 of the 2 CTNNB1 alleles.
Causative mutations were heterozygous. The authors hypothesized that the
mutations might exert a dominant effect, rendering a fraction of
cellular beta-catenin insensitive to APC-mediated downregulation. Thus,
disruption of APC-mediated regulation of beta-catenin/TCF-regulated
transcription is critical for colorectal tumorigenesis. This is most
commonly achieved by recessive inactivating mutations of both APC
alleles, but can also be achieved by dominant mutations of CTNNB1 that
render CRT insensitive to the effects of wildtype APC.

Ilyas et al. (1997) found 5 different mutations in 21 colorectal cancer
cell lines (26%) from 19 patients: a 3-bp deletion from codon 45 and
single-nucleotide missense mutations involving codons 33, 183, 245, and
287. All 23 cell lines studied had full-length beta-catenin protein that
was detectable by Western blotting and that coprecipitated with
E-cadherin. In 3 of the cell lines with CTNNB1 mutations, complexes of
beta-catenin with alpha-catenin and APC were detectable; in 2 other cell
lines, complexes were not detected.

Rubinfeld et al. (1997) detected abnormally high amounts of beta-catenin
in 7 of 26 human melanoma cell lines. Unusual messenger RNA splicing and
missense mutations in the CTNNB1 gene that result in stabilization of
the protein were identified in 6 of the 7 lines, and the APC gene was
altered or missing in 2 others. In the APC-deficient cells, ectopic
expression of wildtype APC eliminated the excess beta-catenin. Cells
with stabilized beta-catenin contained a constitutive beta-catenin/Lef1
complex. Thus, Rubinfeld et al. (1997) concluded that genetic defects
that result in upregulation of beta-catenin may play a role in melanoma
progression.

In a review of hereditary cancer syndromes, Fearon (1997) presented a
useful diagram illustrating how the APC protein regulates beta-catenin
levels in normal cells and how mutations in APC and CTNNB in cancer cell
genes deregulate cell growth via T-cell transcription factor-7-like-2.

Chan et al. (1999) studied 16 human pilomatricomas (132600) and found
CTNNB1 mutations in 12 of them. The mutations occurred in the
amino-terminal segment, normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent,
ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and thus are beta-catenin-stabilizing
mutations. The authors concluded that the 75% mutation rate directly
implicates beta-catenin/LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair
matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans.

Sagae et al. (1999) analyzed 61 primary ovarian carcinomas (167000),
consisting of 49 nonendometrioid-type tumors and 12 endometrioid tumors,
for genetic alteration of the CTNNB1 gene. In 5 carcinomas, including 4
(33%) of the endometrioid-type tumors and 1 (14%) of 7 mucinous-type
tumors, they found 3 somatic CTNNB1 mutations (see, e.g., 116806.0012).
All of the mutations caused alterations at the serine/threonine residues
that are potential sites of phosphorylation of GSK3-beta (GSK3B;
605004). Immunohistochemical studies were performed in 27 of the 61
ovarian carcinomas. Expression of both nuclear and cytoplasmic
beta-catenin was demonstrated in 4 of these 27 ovarian carcinomas for
which tissue samples were available for examination. Sagae et al. (1999)
concluded that the CTNNB1 mutations at potential GSK3B phosphorylation
sites result in accumulation of beta-catenin protein within cells and
its translocation to nuclei.

Wright et al. (1999) identified somatic mutations within exon 3 of the
CTNNB1 gene in 10 of 63 (16%) endometrioid ovarian carcinomas. The
mutations all resulted in missense changes within the GSK3-beta
consensus site.

Hepatoblastoma, a rare malignant tumor of the liver that occurs in
children at an average age of 2 to 3 years, represents the most frequent
malignant liver tumor in childhood. Although most cases are sporadic,
the incidence is highly elevated in patients with familial APC. These
patients carry germline mutations of the APC gene, which controls the
degradation of the CTNNB1 gene product after its NH2-terminal
phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues. APC, as well as CTNNB1, is
a central effector of the growth-promoting 'wingless' signaling pathway
in development. To determine whether this pathway is involved in the
pathogenesis of sporadic hepatoblastomas, Koch et al. (1999) examined 52
biopsies and 3 cell lines from sporadic hepatoblastomas for mutations in
the APC and CTNNB1 genes. In 48% of sporadic hepatoblastomas they found
CTNNB1 mutations (116806.0003-116806.0005). The mutations affected exon
3, which encodes the degradation targeting box of CTNNB1, and led to
accumulation of intracytoplasmic and nuclear beta-catenin protein. In
all, 11 point mutations and 5 small interstitial deletions of 24 to 102
bp were found. Eight point mutations abolished serine or threonine
phosphorylation sites. An increased transcriptional activity was
demonstrated in vitro for CTNNB1 forms carrying similar mutations in
exon 3.

A major function of APC is the downregulation of beta-catenin, a
transcription-activating protein with oncogenic potential. Molecular
genetic studies suggest that inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor
may be involved in hepatoblastoma tumorigenesis. In an ongoing
immunohistochemical study of beta-catenin expression in sporadic cases
of tumor types that are associated with adenomatous polyposis coli,
Blaker et al. (1999) observed increased beta-catenin levels in the
cytoplasm and in the nuclei of 3 hepatoblastomas. Sequencing of exon 3
of the CTNNB1 gene revealed an activating mutation in one of the tumor
samples (116806.0003). Thus, beta-catenin accumulation may play a role
in the development of hepatoblastoma and heterozygous activating
mutations of the CTNNB1 gene may substitute for biallelic APC
inactivation in this tumor type.

Legoix et al. (1999) found an activating beta-catenin mutation in exon 3
in 18% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. Among tumors lacking a
beta-catenin mutation, no APC mutation had been detected in a subset of
30 cases tested. The correlation between beta-catenin mutation status
and chromosome segment deletions was studied on a set of 48 hyperploid
tumors. Chromosome 1p, 4q, and 16p deletions were significantly
associated with the absence of beta-catenin mutation. The results
suggested the existence of 2 mechanisms of carcinogenesis: first, a
beta-catenin activating mutation associated with a low rate of loss of
heterozygosity; a second, operating in a context of chromosomal
instability, would involve tumor suppressor genes.

Huang et al. (2000) screened 46 sporadic medulloblastomas for the
presence of mutations in genes of the Wnt signaling pathway (APC and
beta-catenin). Four tumors were found to have miscoding beta-catenin
mutations, 3 of which were located at codon 33 (ser33 to phe;
116806.0007).

In desmoid tumor tissue (see 135290), Shitoh et al. (1999) identified a
somatic thr41-to-ala mutation (116806.0003) in the beta-catenin gene.

Among 166 lung cancers (90 primary tumors and 76 cell lines), 1
blastoma, and 10 malignant mesotheliomas (156240) (2 primary tumors and
8 cell lines), Shigemitsu et al. (2001) identified 4 alterations in exon
3 of the CTNNB1 gene. Among 10 malignant mesotheliomas, they identified
in 1 cell line a homozygous deletion of the entire gene except for exon
1.

Wheeler et al. (2002) examined the possible contribution of beta-catenin
to sporadic small intestinal adenocarcinoma. Beta-catenin protein
expression was assessed immunohistochemically in a total of 21
nonfamilial, nonampullary small intestinal adenocarcinomas. Ten (48%)
showed decreased expression at the cell membrane and increased nuclear
staining; this contrasted with the usual pattern of protein expression
in normal colonic epithelium, where nuclear expression is undetectable
using immunohistochemical techniques. The authors also screened the
mutation cluster region of the APC gene and found no mutations, leading
them to suggest that increased nuclear localization of beta-catenin may
reflect gain-of-function mutation, similar to that seen in up to 25% of
colorectal cancers (Ilyas et al., 1997).

As noted, inactivating mutations of the APC gene or activating mutations
of the CTNNB1 gene initiate colorectal neoplasia. To address the
biochemical and physiologic effects of mutant beta-catenin, Chan et al.
(2002) disrupted either the mutant or wildtype CTNNB1 allele in a human
colorectal cancer cell line. Cells with only wildtype beta-catenin had
decreased colony-forming ability when plated at low density, although
their growth was similar to that of parental cells when passaged under
routine conditions. Immunohistochemistry and cell-fractionation studies
suggested that mutant beta-catenin activity was distinguished primarily
by cellular localization and not by protein degradation. Unexpectedly,
they found that mutant beta-catenin bound less well to E-cadherin (CDH1;
192090) than did wildtype beta-catenin, and the membranous localization
of wildtype and mutant beta-catenin was accordingly distinct. These
findings were considered to pose serious challenges to the current
models of APC/beta-catenin function.

Moreno-Bueno et al. (2001) analyzed the expression pattern of
beta-catenin in normal anagen hair follicles and in 40 human
pilomatrixomas by immunohistochemistry. In 11 of these tumors they also
studied exon 3 beta-catenin gene mutations by PCR and direct sequencing.
As these mutations have been related to a replication error (RER)
phenotype in other tumor types, Moreno-Bueno et al. (2001) explored
whether or not this association also occurs in pilomatrixomas.
Beta-catenin was expressed in the cell membranes of the outer and inner
root sheaths and in matrix cells located at the base and periphery of
the hair follicle bulb. However, central matrix cells that differentiate
into cortical cells, cortical, and cuticular cells expressed
beta-catenin in the nucleus, suggesting a role in signal transduction.
In addition, some fibroblasts of the dermal papilla also showed nuclear
expression of beta-catenin. All 40 analyzed pilomatrixomas showed
intense nuclear and cytoplasmic beta-catenin expression in proliferating
matrix (basaloid) cells. In areas of maturation, transitional cells
mainly showed cytoplasmic and membranous expression of beta-catenin,
while only a few cells retained nuclear expression. Shadow or ghost
cells did not show beta-catenin expression. Three of 11 tumors (26%) had
beta-catenin mutations. All 3 had the same heterozygous missense
mutation: a G-to-T change affecting the first nucleotide at codon 32
(116806.0016). None of the 11 tumors studied had a positive RER
phenotype. Moreno-Bueno et al. (2001) concluded that the
Wnt/Ctnnb1/Tcf-Lef pathway is activated in normal matrix cells of the
hair follicle to induce differentiation to the hair shaft. Additionally,
the beta-catenin mutation in matrix cells of the hair follicle
stabilizes beta-catenin protein, which translocates into the nucleus,
where it activates gene transcription together with lymphoid enhancer
factor-1 (153245)-producing pilomatrixoma. These mutations occur without
an underlying defect in DNA mismatch repair.

ANIMAL MODEL

An effector of intercellular adhesion, beta-catenin also functions in
Wnt signaling, associating with Lef1/Tcf DNA-binding proteins to form a
transcription factor. Gat et al. (1998) reported that this pathway also
operates in keratinocytes and that mice expressing beta-catenin
controlled by an epidermal promoter undergo a process resembling de novo
hair morphogenesis. The new follicles form sebaceous glands and dermal
papilla, normally established only in embryogenesis. As in
embryologically initiated hair germs, transgenic follicles induce Lef1,
but follicles are disoriented and defective in Sonic hedgehog
polarization. Additionally, proliferation continues unchecked, resulting
in 2 types of tumors (epithelioid cysts and trichofolliculomas) that are
also found in humans. Older transgenic mice develop pilomatricomas.
These findings suggested that transient beta-catenin stabilization may
be a key player in the epidermal signal leading to hair development and
implicated aberrant beta-catenin activation in hair tumors.

Harada et al. (1999) found that targeted deletion of exon 3 in mice,
which encodes serines and threonines phosphorylated by GSK3-beta, caused
adenomatous intestinal polyps resembling those in Apc knockout mice.
Some nascent microadenomas were also found in the colon.

To study the role of beta-catenin in skin development, Huelsken et al.
(2001) introduced a conditional mutation of the gene in the epidermis
and hair follicles of mice using Cre/loxP technology. When beta-catenin
was mutated during embryogenesis, formation of placodes that generate
hair follicles was blocked. The authors showed that beta-catenin is
required genetically downstream of Tabby (300450) and downless (EDAR;
604095) and upstream of bone morphogenetic proteins (see 112262) and Shh
(600725) in placode formation. If beta-catenin was deleted after hair
follicles had formed, hair was completely lost after the first hair
cycle. Further analysis demonstrated that beta-catenin is essential for
fate decisions of skin stem cells: in the absence of beta-catenin, stem
cells failed to differentiate into follicular keratinocytes and instead
adopted an epidermal fate.

Saadi-Kheddouci et al. (2001) found that transgenic mice that
overproduced an oncogenic form of beta-catenin in the epithelial cells
of the kidney developed severe polycystic lesions soon after birth.

To examine whether activating beta-catenin signaling could regulate
mammalian brain development, Chenn and Walsh (2002) developed transgenic
mice overexpressing an amino-terminal truncated form of beta-catenin
fused at the carboxyl-terminal with green fluorescent protein in
neuroepithelial precursors. The mice developed enlarged brains with
increased cerebral cortical surface area and folds resembling sulci and
gyri of higher mammals. Brains from transgenic animals have enlarged
lateral ventricles lined with neuroepithelial precursor cells,
reflecting an expansion of the precursor population. Compared with
wildtype precursors, a greater proportion of transgenic precursors
reenter the cell cycle after mitosis. Chenn and Walsh (2002) concluded
that their results showed that beta-catenin can function in the decision
of precursors to proliferate or differentiate during mammalian neuronal
development and suggested that beta-catenin can regulate cerebral
cortical size by controlling the generation of neuronal precursor cells.

Lickert et al. (2002) conditionally inactivated the beta-catenin gene in
cells of structures that exhibit organizer functions in mouse embryos:
the visceral endoderm, the node, the notochord, and the definitive
endoderm. Mesoderm formation was not affected in mutant embryos, but the
node was missing, patterning of the head and trunk was affected, and no
notochord or somites were formed. Deletion of beta-catenin in the
definitive endoderm led to the formation of multiple hearts along the
anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Ectopic hearts developed in
parallel with the normal heart in regions of ectopic Bmp2 expression.
Lickert et al. (2002) concluded that ablation of beta-catenin in
embryonic endoderm changes cell fate from endoderm to precardiac
mesoderm.

By conditional gene ablation in mice, Soshnikova et al. (2003) found
that Wnt signaling is a key regulator of formation of the apical
ectodermal ridge (AER) and the dorsal-ventral axis of the limbs. They
generated compound mutants and showed that beta-catenin acts downstream
of BMP receptor-1A (BMPR1A; 601299) in AER induction, but upstream or
parallel in dorsal-ventral patterning. Soshnikova et al. (2003)
concluded that AER formation and dorsal-ventral patterning of limbs is
tightly controlled by Wnt/beta-catenin and BMP receptor signaling.

In mice bred to have T cells lacking Ctnnb1, Xu et al. (2003) observed a
substantial reduction in the number of splenic T cells. Splenic T cells
from these mice responded poorly to T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation
but showed no signs of enhanced cell death. Analysis of thymic
development suggested that Ctnnb1 deletion affected pre-TCR signaling in
double-negative thymocytes and impaired T-cell development at the level
of the beta selection checkpoint.

Day et al. (2005) found that ectopic canonical Wnt signaling led to
enhanced ossification and suppression of chondrocyte formation in mice.
Conversely, genetic inactivation of beta-catenin caused ectopic
formation of chondrocytes at the expense of osteoblast differentiation
during both intramembranous and endochondral ossification.

By conditional deletion of beta-catenin in mouse limb and head
mesenchyme, Hill et al. (2005) found that beta-catenin was required for
osteoblast lineage differentiation. Osteoblast precursors lacking
beta-catenin were blocked in differentiation and developed into
chondrocytes. Further experiments showed that beta-catenin activity was
necessary and sufficient to repress the differentiation of mesenchymal
cells into skeletal precursors.

Glass et al. (2005) engineered mice harboring either gain-of-function or
loss-of-function beta-catenin mutations targeted to osteoblasts. These
mice developed high and low bone mass phenotypes, respectively, caused
primarily by modification of bone resorption. Molecular analysis
revealed that canonical Wnt signaling controlled this process by
regulating expression of Opg (TNFRSF11B; 602643) within osteoblasts.
Glass et al. (2005) concluded that canonical Wnt signaling in
osteoblasts is a major negative regulator of bone resorption.

Using a gerbil model of gastritis and gastric cancer, Franco et al.
(2005) showed that in vivo adaptation of Helicobacter pylori by multiple
passages allowed a more rapid and reproducible induction of gastric
dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. The oncogenic H. pylori strain selectively
activated Ctnnb in gastric epithelia in a manner dependent on
translocation of bacterial CagA into host epithelial cells. Ctnnb
nuclear accumulation was increased in gastric epithelium from gerbils
infected with the carcinogenic H. pylori strain, as well as in persons
carrying Cag-positive versus Cag-negative bacterial strains or
uninfected persons. Franco et al. (2005) proposed that H. pylori-induced
dysregulation of CTNNB may explain, at least in part, the augmented risk
of gastric cancer after infection with this pathogen.

Zamora et al. (2007) found that conditional deletion of beta-catenin in
mouse proepicardium led to impaired formation of coronary arteries,
whereas the venous system and microvasculature of mutant mice were
normal. Mutant mice exhibited impaired epicardial development, including
failed expansion of the subepicardial space, blunted invasion of the
myocardium, and impaired differentiation of epicardium-derived
mesenchymal cells into coronary smooth muscle cells.

After amputation, freshwater planarians properly regenerate a head or
tail from the resulting anterior or posterior wound. Gurley et al.
(2008) found that in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, RNA
interference (RNAi) of beta-catenin or dishevelled (601365) causes the
inappropriate regeneration of a head instead of a tail at posterior
amputations. Conversely, RNAi of the beta-catenin antagonist adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC; 611731) results in the regeneration of a tail at
anterior wounds. In addition, the silencing of beta-catenin is
sufficient to transform the tail of uncut adult animals into a head.
Gurley et al. (2008) suggested that beta-catenin functions as a
molecular switch to specify and maintain anteroposterior identity during
regeneration and homeostasis in planarians.

Petersen and Reddien (2008) independently performed experiments similar
to those described by Gurley et al. (2008) and identified a single gene,
which they called Smed-beta-catenin, that defines the character of the
anterioposterior axis throughout the Bilateria and specifies
regeneration polarity in planarians.

Liu et al. (2009) ablated beta-catenin specifically in the Sf1 (NR5A1;
601516)-positive population of mouse somatic cells and showed that
beta-catenin was present in gonads of both sexes but was necessary only
for ovarian differentiation but dispensable for testis development. Loss
of beta-catenin in fetal testes did not affect Sertoli cell
differentiation, testis morphogenesis, or masculinization of the
embryos. However, there were molecular and morphologic defects in
ovaries lacking beta-catenin, including formation of testis-specific
coelomic vessel, appearance of androgen-producing adrenal-like cells,
and loss of female germ cells. These phenotypes were strikingly similar
to those found in the Rspo1 (609595)- and Wnt4 (603490)-knockout
ovaries. In the absence of beta-catenin, expression of Wnt4 was
downregulated, while that of Rspo1 was not affected, placing
beta-catenin as a component in between Rspo1 and Wnt4.

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC; 202300) is a rare but aggressive cancer.
Constitutive activation of beta-catenin is the most frequent alteration
in benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors in humans. Berthon et al.
(2010) showed that constitutive activation of beta-catenin in the
adrenal cortex of transgenic mice resulted in progressive steroidogenic
and undifferentiated spindle-shaped cell hyperplasia as well as
dysplasia of the cortex and medulla. Over 17 months, transgenic adrenals
developed malignant characteristics such as uncontrolled
neovascularization and loco-regional metastatic invasion. These
oncogenic events were accompanied by ectopic differentiation of
glomerulosa at the expense of fasciculata cells, which caused primary
hyperaldosteronism. Berthon et al. (2010) concluded that constitutively
active beta-catenin is an adrenal oncogene, which may trigger benign
aldosterone-secreting tumor development and promote malignancy.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COLORECTAL CANCER, SOMATIC
CTNNB1, 3-BP DEL, SER45DEL

In 2 colorectal cancer (see 114500) cell lines that expressed
full-length APC, yet had escaped inhibition of transcriptional
activation mediated by beta-catenin and TCF7L2, Morin et al. (1997)
found a mutation in a downstream component of the APC tumor suppressor
pathway, namely in the CTNNB1 gene. Each tumor line had a different
mutation: a 3-bp deletion that removed an amino acid (ser45) in one and
a C-to-A missense mutation that changed ser33 to tyr (116806.0002) in
the other. Analysis of paraffin-embedded archival tissue from the first
patient confirmed the somatic nature of this mutation and its presence
in the primary tumor before culture. Both mutations affected serines
that have been implicated in the downregulation of beta-catenin through
phosphorylation.

COLORECTAL CANCER, SOMATIC
PILOMATRICOMA, SOMATIC, INCLUDED
CTNNB1, SER33TYR

See 116806.0001 and Morin et al. (1997). One of the 5 point mutations
found by Ilyas et al. (1997) in colorectal cancer (see 114500) cell
lines was a ser33-to-tyr mutation due to a C-to-A transversion in exon 3
of the CTNNB1 gene. The mutation was present in heterozygous form.

Chan et al. (1999) identified this mutation in 2 of 16 pilomatricomas
(132600).

HEPATOBLASTOMA, SOMATIC
DESMOID TUMOR, SOMATIC, INCLUDED
CTNNB1, THR41ALA

In 6 sporadic hepatoblastomas (see 114550), Koch et al. (1999) found an
A-to-G transition in codon 41 of the CTNNB1 gene, resulting in a
thr41-to-ala (T41A) substitution. (Iwao et al. (1998) described codon 41
mutations in sporadic colorectal carcinomas.) The ages of the patients
with the T41A mutation and hepatoblastoma ranged from 4 to 27 months.

In a hepatoblastoma, Blaker et al. (1999) demonstrated intense
cytoplasmic beta-catenin staining compared to adjacent normal liver
tissue and accumulation of beta-catenin in the tumor cell nuclei.
Furthermore, the tumor in one case was found to be heterozygous for an
A-to-G transition converting codon 41 from ACC (thr) to GCC (ala).
Legoix et al. (1999) found this same mutation in 3 cases of
hepatocellular carcinoma. Rather than being childhood cases, these were
adults (mean age 58 years; range, 27 to 76 years). In the group of 98
cases, many of the subjects were alcoholics.

Shitoh et al. (1999) identified a somatic T41A mutation in the CTNNB1
gene within desmoid tumor tissue derived from a patient with sporadic
disease (see 135290).

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 19
CTNNB1, 4-BP DEL, NT1272

In a 29-year-old woman with severe intellectual disability, short

602623	TITLE *602623 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 5; FKBP5
;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, 51-KD; FKBP51;;
FKBP54
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

Nair et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA for human FKBP51 from a HeLa cell cDNA
library. The FKBP51 cDNA encodes a predicted 457-amino acid polypeptide
with 90% identity to mouse fkbp51 and 55% identity to FKBP52 (600611).
Baughman et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding human FKBP51 by screening
a human thymus cDNA library with a fragment of the murine Fkbp51 cDNA.
The human FKBP51 cDNA encodes a deduced 457-amino acid protein that
shows 87% sequence identity to the mouse protein. Northern blot analysis
revealed that treatment of leukemic T cells with glucocorticoids results
in a marked increase in expression of a 3.7-kb transcript. Western blot
analysis showed that unlike the predominant T-cell expression of the
mouse protein, FKBP51 is expressed as a 51-kD protein in a variety of
tissues but not in brain, colon, or lung. The expression is frequently
in molar excess of that of FKBP12 (FKBP1A; 186945), but its capacity to
inhibit calcineurin is significantly lower than that of FKBP1A.

Baughman et al. (1995) and Yeh et al. (1995) cloned and characterized
the mouse Fkbp51 gene. Baughman et al. (1995) isolated the gene based on
its induction during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in murine thymoma
cells. Murine Fkbp51 encodes a 456-amino acid polypeptide with a
predicted mass of 51 kD. Yeh et al. (1995) isolated the mouse gene based
on the selective accumulation of its transcript during adipocyte
differentiation. By Northern blot analysis, the gene is expressed in a
variety of tissues, with highest levels in liver, skeletal muscle, and
kidney.

MAPPING

International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FKBP51 gene
to chromosome 6 (TMAP RH47153).

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis, Baughman et al. (1995) showed that the murine
Fkbp51 gene is expressed in all tissues, most abundantly in T
lymphocytes and in the thymus. Baughman et al. (1995) showed that FKBP5
has PPIase activity and is inhibited by rapamycin and FK520, a
structural analog that is virtually identical to FK506. Yeh et al.
(1995) showed that the PPIase activity of murine Fkbp51 is inhibited by
FK506 but not by cyclosporin A.

Nair et al. (1997) showed that FKBP51 is inhibited by FK506 but not by
cyclosporine. The authors demonstrated that FKBP51 and FKBP52 bind to
Hsp90 (140571) in a competitive manner. Nair et al. (1997) also showed
that Hsp90, Hsp70 (140550), and p23 (607061), a component of the
progesterone receptor complex, bind directly or indirectly to FKBP51.

Vermeer et al. (2003) studied whether the glucocorticoid-induced
increase of the mRNA encoding FKBP5 could be used for the development of
a novel assay, ultimately to be used in native human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Glucocorticoid addition to human
lymphoblastoid cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase of FKBP5 mRNA
levels within 2 hours, followed by a further increase until 24 hours.
Northern blot analysis and real-time PCR yielded similar results.
Coincubation of glucocorticoids with the glucocorticoid receptor
(138040) antagonist ORG34116 or the protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide suggested a direct, glucocorticoid receptor-mediated
upregulation of FKBP5 gene transcription. They concluded that the
induction of FKBP5 mRNA by glucocorticoids may be a suitable marker to
assess individual glucocorticoid sensitivity, the in vitro measurement
of glucocorticoid potency, and the in vivo determination of
glucocorticoid bioavailability.

Using gene expression microarrays, Woodruff et al. (2007) found that
CLCA1 (603906), periostin (POSTN; 608777), and SERPINB2 (PAI2; 173390)
were upregulated in airway epithelial cells of individuals with asthma
(see 600807), but not smokers. Corticosteroid treatment downregulated
expression of these 3 genes and upregulated expression of FKBP51. High
baseline expression of CLCA1, POSTN, and SERPINB2 was associated with a
good clinical response to corticosteroids, whereas high expression of
FKBP51 was associated with a poor response.

Tissing et al. (2007) found that 8 hours of prednisolone treatment
altered expression of 51 genes in leukemic cells from children with
precursor-B- or T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared with nonexposed
cells. The 3 most highly upregulated genes were FKBP5, ZBTB16 (176797),
and TXNIP (606599), which were upregulated 35.4-, 8.8-, and 3.7-fold,
respectively.

Attwood et al. (2011) demonstrated in mice that the serine protease
neuropsin (60564) is critical for stress-related plasticity in the
amygdala by regulating the dynamics of the EphB2 (600997)-NMDA receptor
interaction, the expression of Fkbp5, and anxiety-like behavior. Stress
results in neuropsin-dependent cleavage of EphB2 in the amygdala,
causing dissociation of EphB2 from the NR1 (138249) subunit of the NMDA
receptor and promoting membrane turnover of EphB2 receptors. Dynamic
EphB2-NR1 interaction enhances NMDA receptor current, induces Fkpb5 gene
expression, and enhances behavioral signatures of anxiety. On stress,
neuropsin-deficient mice do not show EphB2 cleavage and its dissociation
from NR1, resulting in a static EphB2-NR1 interaction, attenuated
induction of the Fkbp5 gene, and low anxiety. The behavioral response to
stress can be restored by intraamygdala injection of neuropsin into
neuropsin-deficient mice and disrupted by the injection of either
anti-EphB2 antibodies or silencing the Fkbp5 gene in the amygdala of
wildtype mice. Attwood et al. (2011) concluded that their findings
established a novel neuronal pathway linking stress-induced proteolysis
of EphB2 in the amygdala to anxiety.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The stress hormone-regulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
has been implicated in the causality as well as the treatment of
depression (608516). To investigate a possible association between genes
regulating the HPA axis and response to antidepressants and
susceptibility for depression, Binder et al. (2004) genotyped
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 of these genes in depressed
individuals and matched controls. They found significant associations of
response to antidepressants and the recurrence of depressive episodes
with SNPs in FKBP5, a glucocorticoid receptor-regulating cochaperone of
hsp90 (see 140571), in 2 independent samples. These SNPs were also
associated with increased intracellular FKBP5 protein expression, which
triggers adaptive changes in glucocorticoid receptor and, thereby, HPA
axis regulation. Individuals carrying the associated genotypes had less
HPA-axis hyperactivity during the depressive episode. Binder et al.
(2004) proposed that the FKBP5 variant-dependent alterations in HPA-axis
regulation could be related to the faster response to antidepressant
drug treatment and the increased recurrence of depressive episodes
observed in this group of depressed individuals. These findings
supported a central role of genes regulating the HPA axis in the
causality of depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressant
drugs.

In 294 individuals with major depressive disorder (608516) and 339
matched controls, Binder et al. (2004) found that individuals homozygous
for the T allele of a C/T polymorphism in the FKBP5 gene, dbSNP
rs1360780, had an accelerated response to antidepressants over 5 weeks
of treatment. The responses of CT heterozygotes and CC homozygotes were
significantly slower than those of TT homozygotes and were almost
identical to each other. The authors also found that individuals with
the TT genotype had experienced more than twice as many depressive
episodes before the index episode, suggesting that these individuals
have more lifetime depressive episodes in addition to their faster
response to antidepressant drugs.

607559	TITLE *607559 MAHOGUNIN, RING FINGER 1; MGRN1
;;MAHOGANOID, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
KIAA0544
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mahogunin (MGRN1) is a C3HC4 RING-containing protein with E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity in vitro.

CLONING

'Mahoganoid' is a mouse coat color mutation whose pigmentary phenotype
and genetic interactions resemble those of 'mahogany,' which results
from mutation in attractin (ATRN; 603130). He et al. (2003) and Phan et
al. (2002) cloned the mouse mahogunin gene, mutant in mahoganoid mice.
Both groups identified the human homolog as KIAA0544 (Nagase et al.,
1998).

GENE STRUCTURE

The human MGRN1 gene contains 17 exons (Phan et al., 2002; He et al.,
2003).

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the KIAA0544 cDNA, corresponding to the
MGRN1 gene, to chromosome 16 by radiation hybrid analysis. Phan et al.
(2002) and He et al. (2003) mapped the MGRN1 gene to 16p13.3; the mouse
homolog maps to chromosome 16.

GENE FUNCTION

Human and mouse mahogunin share 95% amino acid sequence identity and
exhibit a similar expression pattern across multiple tissues with
particularly high levels in brain (He et al., 2003). The RING domain
functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and autoubiquitination is dependent
on ATP, E1, E2, and an intact mahogunin RING domain, with ladder
formation proportional to the amounts. In addition, mahogunin-induced
autoubiquitination exhibited specificity for E2; it occurred with UBC5,
used frequently in the stress response to unfolded proteins, but not
with UBC3, used frequently in cell cycle transitions.

He et al. (2003) determined that the MGRN1 gene encodes 4 mRNA isoforms
that contain a central C3HC4 RING domain as the only recognizable
protein motif; however, regions flanking the RING domain and the
N-terminal region of the protein are also conserved between vertebrate
and invertebrate genomes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mahogunin is the protein mutant in 'mahoganoid,' a coat-color mutation
of mice in which pigmentation is very similar to that of 'mahogany.' The
mahogany phenotype is caused by mutation in attractin (ATRN; 603130). He
et al. (2003) found that animals carrying the original allele, md,
synthesize small amounts of yellow pigment on the flank and ventrum and
do not develop spongy degeneration up to 5 months of age. However,
animals carrying the md(nc) allele (originally known as 'nonagouti
curly') develop progressive spongiform changes, first apparent in the
hippocampus CA3 region at 2 months of age and later extending to
multiple regions of the brain. Vacuolation predominates in the gray
matter and is associated with neuronal loss but preservation of tissue
architecture; the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, brainstem,
caudate-putamen, and cerebellum granule layer are the most consistently
affected regions. In md(nc)/md(nc) mice at 10 months of age, some
regions of the deep cortex and lateral thalamus exhibit mild
astrocytosis before the formation of microscopically visible vacuoles.
Northern hybridization to mouse brain mRNA revealed that md/md mice
expressed reduced levels of a normal-sized transcript and transcripts of
aberrant size, consistent with an intracisternal A particle insertion
into intron 11A. For the md(nc) allele, no transcript was detected by
Northern hybridization, and a thymidine-to-adenine mutation was
identified at position 2 of intron 9 of the Mgrn1 gene. Thus, partial
loss of function for this gene causes a reduction of yellow pigment in
the md allele and complete loss of function causes absence of yellow
pigment and neurodegeneration in the md(nc) allele. The brain
degeneration in md(nc) resembles prion-induced spongiform
encephalopathy. However, no accumulation of the protease-resistant PrP
isoform (PrP-Sc) was seen in these animals.

605452	TITLE *605452 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 6; ABCB6
;;MITOCHONDRIAL ABC PROTEIN 3; MTABC3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

For background information on the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of
transporter proteins, see ABCA4 (601691). In addition to the 'full' ABC
transporters with 2 transmembrane domains and 2 nucleotide-binding
domains, there are 'half' proteins that contain only 1 of each domain
(e.g., ABCB1, 171050). Full transporters are usually found in the plasma
membrane, whereas half transporters are found in subcellular organelles.
ABCB6 is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is required for
mitochondrial porphyrin uptake (Krishnamurthy et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching an EST database and screening a liver cDNA library,
Mitsuhashi et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA encoding ABCB6, which they
called MTABC3. The predicted 842-amino acid ABCB6 protein, which is 34%
identical to the half transporter ABCB7 (300135), has 8
membrane-spanning regions. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.4-kb
transcript in all tissues tested, with highest expression in heart and
skeletal muscles. Immunoblot, confocal microscopy, and electron
immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that ABCB6 is expressed as an
80-kD mitochondrial membrane protein. Analysis of mutant yeast
mitochondria suggested that ABCB6 may help maintain respiratory function
and may also transport Fe/S clusters from mitochondria to the cytosol,
thereby helping to prevent iron accumulation and DNA damage in the
organelle.

In zebrafish, Wang et al. (2012) demonstrated expression of abcb6 in the
eye and central nervous system. Using RT-PCR in human cell lines and
tissues, they observed much higher expression of ABCB6 in retinal and
retinal pigment epithelium cells than in other tissues studied.

By immunohistochemical staining of normal human skin, Zhang et al.
(2013) demonstrated that ABCB6 localizes to the epidermis and has
diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Western blot analysis confirmed
expression of ABCB6 in human keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line) and
melanocytes (A375 cells).

GENE STRUCTURE

Mitsuhashi et al. (2000) determined that the ABCB6 gene spans 11 kb and
contains 19 exons in the protein-coding region.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Mitsuhashi et al. (2000) mapped the ABCB6 gene to 2q36,
close to the locus for lethal neonatal metabolic syndrome (603358), a
disorder of mitochondrial function associated with iron metabolism.

GENE FUNCTION

Transport of porphyrins into isolated mitochondria is energy-dependent,
as expected for the movement of anions into a negatively charged
environment. ATP-binding cassette transporters actively facilitate the
transmembrane movement of substances. Krishnamurthy et al. (2006) found
that the mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB6 is
upregulated (mRNA and protein in human and mouse cells) by elevation of
cellular porphyrins and postulated that ABCB6 has a function in
porphyrin transport. The authors also predicted that ABCB6 is
functionally linked to heme biosynthesis, because its mRNA is found in
both human bone marrow and CD71+ early erythroid cells (by database
searching), and because ABCB6 is highly expressed in human fetal liver,
and Abcb6 in mouse embryonic liver. Krishnamurthy et al. (2006)
demonstrated that ABCB6 is uniquely located in the outer mitochondrial
membrane and is required for mitochondrial porphyrin uptake. After ABCB6
is upregulated in response to increased intracellular porphyrin,
mitochondrial porphyrin uptake activates de novo porphyrin biosynthesis.
This process was blocked when the Abcb6 gene in mice was silenced.
Krishnamurthy et al. (2006) concluded that their results challenged
previous assumptions about the intracellular movement of porphyrins and
the factors controlling heme biosynthesis.

Helias et al. (2012) identified ABCB6 as the genetic basis of the
Langereis (Lan) blood group antigen (see 111600). ABCB6 was demonstrated
to be present at the plasma membrane of erythrocytes, and the protein
was shown to play a role in export of porphyrin from red blood cells.
The Lan antigen was also present on HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma
cells, but not on several other cancer cell lines.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Lan(-) Blood Group Phenotype

In 12 individuals with the Langereis(-) blood group phenotype (111600),
Helias et al. (2012) identified 10 different truncating mutations in the
ABCB6 gene (see, e.g., 605452.0001-605452.0005). All mutations were
present in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state, indicating
autosomal recessive inheritance of the trait. None of the individuals
had anemia, abnormal erythropoiesis, or signs of porphyria, but some of
the women developed anti-Lan antibodies during pregnancy and/or in
response to transfusion with Lan(+) blood. Helias et al. (2012)
suggested that Lan(-) individuals may have altered pharmacokinetics with
regard to certain drugs potentially transported by ABCB6.

- Isolated Microphthalmia with Coloboma 7

In a 3-generation Chinese family, originally reported by Dong et al.
(2009), with autosomal dominant iris and chorioretinal coloboma (614497)
mapping to chromosome 2q35 and known to be negative for mutation in
coloboma-associated genes, Wang et al. (2012) sequenced the exons of 76
candidate genes and identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the
ABCB6 gene (L811V; 605452.0006) that segregated with the disease.
Subsequent analysis of ABCB6 in 116 sporadic Indian patients with
coloboma who were negative for mutation in 9 known coloboma genes
revealed heterozygosity for a different missense mutation (A57T;
605452.0007) in 3 unrelated patients with microphthalmia and coloboma
(MCOPCB7; 614497).

- Dyschromatosis Universalis Hereditaria 3

In a 5-generation Chinese family segregating autosomal dominant
dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH3; 615402) mapping to
chromosome 2q33.1-q36.1, Zhang et al. (2013) performed whole-exome and
Sanger sequencing and identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the
ABCB6 gene (L356P; 605452.0008) that segregated with disease in the
family and was not found in 500 geographically matched controls.
Screening of the ABCB6 gene in 6 sporadic DUH patients revealed
heterozygosity for missense mutations (S170G, 605452.0009; G579E,
605452.0010) in 2 patients. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected
B16 cell lines demonstrated that mutant ABCB6 is retained in the Golgi
apparatus, whereas wildtype protein accumulates in the dendrites.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wang et al. (2012) performed morpholino knockdown of abcb6 in zebrafish
and observed coloboma and retarded development. The phenotypes could be
rescued by wildtype ABCB6 mRNA, but could not be rescued by injection of
human mRNA containing either the L811V (605452.0006) or the A57T
(605452.0007) mutation.

169G-A transition in exon 1 of the ABCB6 gene, resulting in an
ala57-to-thr (A57T) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation was not found in 200 ethnically matched control DNA samples.

DYSCHROMATOSIS UNIVERSALIS HEREDITARIA 3
ABCB6, LEU356PRO

In 10 affected members over 5 generations of a Chinese family with
dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH3; 615402), Zhang et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a c.1067T-C transition in exon 5 of
the ABCB6 gene, resulting in a leu356-to-pro (L356P) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The mutation was not found in unaffected
family members or in 500 geographically matched controls.
Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected mouse B16 cell lines
demonstrated that the L356P mutant is largely retained in the Golgi
apparatus, whereas wildtype ABCB6 accumulates in the dendrites.

transition in exon 1 of the ABCB6 gene, resulting in a ser170-to-gly
(S170G) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was not
found in 400 controls or in the 1000 Genomes Project or UCSC Genome

cell lines demonstrated that the S170G mutant is largely retained in the
Golgi apparatus, whereas wildtype ABCB6 accumulates in the dendrites.

transition in exon 12 of the ABCB6 gene, resulting in a gly579-to-glu
(G579E) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was not
found in 400 controls or in the 1000 Genomes Project or UCSC Genome

609022	TITLE *609022 RAPAMYCIN-INSENSITIVE COMPANION OF MTOR; RICTOR
;;AVO3, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; AVO3;;
KIAA1999
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RICTOR and MTOR (FRAP1; 601231) are components of a protein complex that
integrates nutrient- and growth factor-derived signals to regulate cell
growth (Sarbassov et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ohara et al. (2002) cloned KIAA1999. RT-PCR ELISA detected
intermediate and relatively uniform expression in all adult and fetal
tissues and specific brain regions examined.

By sequencing peptides obtained from purified human RICTOR, followed by
database analysis and RT-PCR, Sarbassov et al. (2004) cloned RICTOR
cDNA. The deduced 1,708-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 192 kD. RICTOR contains evolutionarily conserved sequences,
notably an N-terminal region of about 200 amino acids and several
smaller regions, including a repeated block of 20 amino acids.

Jacinto et al. (2004) cloned mouse Rictor, which they called Avo3. The
deduced protein contains 1,708 amino acids. A 9.5-kb transcript was
detected in all tissues examined, with higher levels in skeletal muscle,
kidney, placenta, and leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Sarbassov et al. (2004) found that there was an inverse correlation
between the relative amounts of RAPTOR (607130) and RICTOR in several
human cell lines. Rapamycin treatment of human embryonic kidney cells
eliminated the binding of MTOR to RAPTOR, but did not affect the
interaction of MTOR with RICTOR. Knockdown of RICTOR caused accumulation
of thick actin fibers throughout much of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells,
loss of actin at the cell cortex, altered distribution of cytoskeletal
proteins, and reduced protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha (see 176960)
activity. Sarbassov et al. (2004) found that the RICTOR-containing MTOR
complex contains LST8 (GBL; 612190) but not RAPTOR. Furthermore, the
RICTOR-MTOR complex did not regulate the MTOR effector S6K1 (608938) and
was not bound by FKBP12 (186945)-rapamycin. Sarbassov et al. (2004)
concluded that the RICTOR-MTOR complex modulates the phosphorylation of
PKC-alpha and the actin cytoskeleton, similar to TOR signaling in yeast.

Jacinto et al. (2004) identified 2 distinct mammalian TOR complexes:
TORC1, which contains TOR, LST8, and RAPTOR, and TORC2, which contains
TOR, LST8, and RICTOR. Like yeast TORC2, mammalian TORC2 was rapamycin
insensitive and functioned upstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin
cytoskeleton. TORC2 did not regulate S6K activity. Knockdown of TORC2,
but not TORC1, prevented paxillin (602505) phosphorylation, actin
polymerization, and cell spreading.

Akt/PKB (164730) activation requires the phosphorylation of ser473.
Sarbassov et al. (2005) showed that in Drosophila and in human cells TOR
(FRAP1; 601231) and its associated protein rictor are necessary for
ser473 phosphorylation, and that a reduction in rictor or mTOR
expression inhibited an AKT/PKB effector. The rictor-mTOR complex
directly phosphorylated Akt/PKB on ser473 in vitro and facilitated
thr308 phosphorylation by PDK1 (605213).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ohara et al. (2002) mapped the RICTOR gene
to chromosome 5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yang et al. (2006) found that Rictor knockout in mice was embryonic
lethal. Rictor -/- embryos had no detectable Akt phosphorylation on
ser473 and greatly reduced Akt phosphorylation on thr308. Western blot
analysis showed that phosphorylation of multiple Akt substrates was
decreased in Rictor -/- embryos. Yang et al. (2006) concluded that TORC2
plays a critical role in AKT activation.

By analysis of Rictor-null mouse embryos, Shiota et al. (2006) found
that Rictor was critical for Akt phosphorylation during embryogenesis,
and that it was essential for normal growth and development. Rictor-null
mouse fibroblasts exhibited low proliferation rates, impaired Akt
activity, and diminished metabolic activity.

Lee et al. (2010) found that mice with a conditional deletion of Rictor,
an essential component of TORC2, exhibited impaired differentiation into
Th1 and Th2 cells but retained Th17 cell generation. Immunoblot analysis
of activated Cd4 (1869440)-positive T cells revealed reduced
phosphorylation of Akt and Pkc. In Rictor-deficient cells,
complementation with active Akt restored only Tbet (TBX21; 604895)
expression and Th1 cell differentiation, whereas activated Pkc-theta
(PRKCQ; 600448) reverted only Gata3 (131320) transcription and Th2 cell
defects. Lee et al. (2010) concluded that the dominant function of TORC2
under physiologic conditions in T cells is to guide differentiation
mediated dichotomously by the TORC2 targets AKT and PKC.

605003	TITLE *605003 SENTRIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE FAMILY, MEMBER 6; SENP6
;;SUMO1-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 1; SUSP1; SSP1
SUSP1/TCBA1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin-like molecules (UBLs), such as SUMO1 (UBL1; 601912), are
structurally related to ubiquitin (191339) and can be ligated to target
proteins in a similar manner as ubiquitin. However, covalent attachment
of UBLs does not result in degradation of the modified proteins. SUMO1
modification is implicated in the targeting of RANGAP1 (602362) to the
nuclear pore complex, as well as in stabilization of I-kappa-B-alpha
(NFKBIA; 164008) from degradation by the 26S proteasome. Like ubiquitin,
UBLs are synthesized as precursor proteins, with 1 or more amino acids
following the C-terminal glycine-glycine residues of the mature UBL
protein. Thus, the tail sequences of the UBL precursors need to be
removed by UBL-specific proteases, such as SENP6, prior to their
conjugation to target proteins (Kim et al., 2000). SENPs also display
isopeptidase activity for deconjugation of SUMO-conjugated substrates
(Lima and Reverter, 2008).

CLONING

By screening human brain cDNAs for the potential to encode proteins that
are at least 50 kD, Nagase et al. (1998) isolated a partial SUSP1 cDNA,
which they called KIAA0797, that lacks 5-prime coding sequence. The
deduced partial SUSP1 protein has 1,084 amino acids. RT-PCR followed by
ELISA detected SUSP1 expression in all 10 human tissues examined, with
highest expression in ovary and lowest expression in spleen.

By 5-prime-anchored PCR using the KIAA0797 cDNA isolated by Nagase et
al. (1998), Kim et al. (2000) determined the complete SUSP1 coding
sequence. The deduced 1,112-amino acid SUSP1 protein is a cysteine
protease containing the conserved histidine, aspartic acid, and cysteine
residues of the catalytic triad and the invariant glutamine residue that
helps form the oxyanion hole. The sequence similarity of SUSP1 to other
known UBL-specific proteases was largely restricted to the active site
domains. Recombinant SUSP1 was exclusively localized to the cytoplasm of
mammalian cells. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb SUSP1
transcript in various human tissues. The highest expression of SUSP1 was
in reproductive organs, namely testis, ovary, and prostate. SUSP1 was
also expressed in colon and peripheral blood leukocytes. Little or no
SUSP1 transcripts were detected in brain, liver, lung, kidney, pancreas,
spleen, thymus, heart, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Kim et al. (2000) found that recombinant SUSP1 expressed in bacteria
efficiently released SUMO1 from a SUMO1-beta-galactosidase fusion
protein but not from a RANGAP1-SUMO1 conjugate, suggesting a role for
SUSP1 in the generation of mature SUMO1 specifically from its precursor.
SUSP1 showed a tight substrate specificity for SUMO1. Based on the SUSP1
expression pattern, Kim et al. (2000) suggested that SUSP1 may play a
role in the regulation of SUMO1-mediated cellular processes particularly
related to reproduction.

Lima and Reverter (2008) showed that the isolated catalytic domains of
SENP6 and SENP7 (612846) could not efficiently process SUMO1, SUMO2
(603042), and SUMO3 (602231) precursors. In contrast, SENP6 and SENP7
exhibited efficient SUMO deconjugation activity, with a preference for
substrates containing SUMO2 or SUMO3 over substrates containing SUMO1.
SENP6 and SENP7 showed higher rates for deconjugating di- or poly-SUMO2
and -SUMO3 than for deconjugating SUMO2- or SUMO3-conjugated RANGAP1.
Lima and Reverter (2008) concluded that the high poly-SUMO2 and -SUMO3
chain deconjugation activities of SENP6 and SENP7 may reflect a
preference for flexible isopeptide-linked substrates.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SUSP1
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP WI-6806). By genomic sequence analysis,
Tagawa et al. (2002) mapped the SUSP1 gene to chromosome 6q13.

CYTOGENETICS

HT-1 is a T-cell lymphoma/leukemia cell line with complex cytogenetic
aberrations. Tagawa et al. (2002) found that del(6)(q13q21) in HT-1
cells resulted in fusion of nucleotide 551 of the SUSP1 gene to exon 4
of the TCBA1 gene (NKAIN2; 609758). Nucleotides 489 to 509 of SUSP1 were
deleted in the chimeric transcript. A frameshift occurred in exon 4 of
TCBA1 in the chimeric transcript, resulting in a chimeric protein with a
unique truncated C terminus relative to wildtype SUSP1.

608411	TITLE *608411 EXPORTIN 6; XPO6
;;EXP6;;
KIAA0370
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Exportins, such as XPO6, recruit cargo in the nucleoplasm in the
presence of RAN (601179)-GTP and form ternary export complexes. These
complexes are transported through nuclear pore complexes to the
cytoplasm, where GTP is hydrolyzed and the export complex is
disassembled.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned XPO6, which they designated
KIAA0370. The 3-prime untranslated region contains Alu sequences and
other repetitive elements. RT-PCR detected highest expression of XPO6 in
testis, with lower levels in thymus, prostate, ovary, and placenta.
Little to no expression was detected in the other tissues examined.

By searching for ESTs encoding proteins with putative importin-beta (see
602738)-like RAN-GTP-binding sites, followed by 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR
of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Stuven et al. (2003) cloned XPO6, which
they called EXP6. The deduced protein contains 1,125 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Stuven et al. (2003) demonstrated that recombinant XPO6 bound beta-actin
(102630), profilin-1 (176610), and several other potential cargos in
HeLa cell nuclear extracts only in the presence of RAN-GTP. The
preferred cargo was the profilin-actin complex, since XPO6 showed little
or no binding to either protein in the absence of the other. Analysis of
the weak interaction between XPO6 and isolated actin suggested that XPO6
bound the complex via association with the actin component. Knockdown of
Drosophila Exp6 by RNA interference abolished nuclear exclusion of actin
and resulted in the appearance of nuclear actin paracrystals.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the XPO6 gene
to chromosome 16.

614797	TITLE *614797 PELLINO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; PELI1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pellino proteins, such as PELI1, are intermediate components in the
innate immune response signaling cascades initiated by Toll-like
receptors (TLRs; see 603030) and IL1R (147810), and interact with the
Drosophila Pelle homolog IRAK1 (300283), TRAF6 (602355), and NFKB (see
164011) (summary by Jensen and Whitehead, 2003).

CLONING

By database searching, Resch et al. (2001) identified mouse and human
homologs of Drosophila Pellino. The PELI1 gene encodes a 418-amino acid
protein in both mice and humans.

GENE FUNCTION

By coprecipitation and Western blot analysis, Jensen and Whitehead
(2003) showed that PELI1 interacts with the proteins TRAF6 and TAK1
(MAP3K7; 602614), both downstream of IRAK1 in the TLR/IL1R cascade, but
not MYD88 (602170), an upstream protein. However, PELI2 (614798) but not
PELI1 promotes the activation of JUN (165160) and ELK1 (311040) through
phosphorylation of JNK (MAPK8; 601158).

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins interacting with
SMAD6 (602931), followed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence
analysis, Choi et al. (2006) isolated PELI1. The SMAD6-PELI1 interaction
was enhanced by treatment with TGFB (190180). Mutation analysis
indicated that the N-terminal region of PELI1 is required for
interaction with SMAD6. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that SMAD6
interaction with PELI1 inhibits IL1R and TLR signaling through a complex
of IRAK1, PELI1, and TRAF6. Inhibition of the complex prevents
degradation of the inhibitor IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008) and translocation of
NFKB to the nucleus, thereby preventing the expression of
proinflammatory genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of SMAD6 reduced the
antiinflammatory activity mediated by TGFB or BMP4 (112262). Choi et al.
(2006) concluded that SMAD6 is a critical mediator of the TGFB-BMP
pathway that controls antiinflammatory activity and negatively regulates
IL1R and TLR signals.

GENE STRUCTURE

Resch et al. (2001) determined that the PELI1 gene consists of 6 exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of YAC contigs, Resch et al. (2001) mapped the PELI1 gene to
chromosome 2p13.3.

;;CBF;;
NUCLEOLAR COMPLEX-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;
NOC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the CCAAT element of the HSP70 (see HSPA1A; 140550) promoter to
screen a human lung fibroblast cDNA expression library, followed by
screening an osteosarcoma cell line cDNA library, Lum et al. (1990)
cloned CEBPZ, which they called CBF. The deduced 998-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 114 kD. CEBPZ has a domain similar to
the sigma homology domain of yeast TFIID (see 313650) that may mediate
protein-protein interactions. CEBPZ also has a consensus nuclear
localization signal and several putative phosphorylation sites. Northern
blot analysis of HeLa cells detected a 3.8-kb CEBPZ transcript. The
endogenous CEBPZ protein in HeLa cells had an apparent molecular mass of
116 kD by SDS-PAGE.

By searching databases for sequences similar to yeast Noc1, Milkereit et
al. (2003) identified human CEBPZ, which they called NOC1. The deduced
998-amino acid protein has a C-terminal NOC domain found in proteins
involved in transport and maturation of ribosomal 60S subunits.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, Lum et al. (1990) showed
that the CCAAT element of the HSP70 promoter interacted directly with
endogenous CEBPZ in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Supershift assays with
recombinant CEBPZ confirmed the interaction. Cotransfection in COS cells
demonstrated that CEBPZ drove expression of a reporter gene from the
CCAAT element of the HSP70 promoter. CEBPZ did not stimulate
transcription from the CCAAT elements of the alpha-globin (HBA1; 141800)
or RSV promoters.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the CRBPZ gene to chromosome 2p22.2 based on an
alignment of the CEBPZ sequence (GenBank GENBANK M37197) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

;;REV3;;
POLYMERASE, DNA, ZETA; POLZ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To get a better understanding of mutagenic mechanisms in humans, Gibbs
et al. (1998) cloned and sequenced the human homolog of the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae REV3 gene. The yeast gene encodes the catalytic
subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, a nonessential enzyme that is thought to
carry out translesion replication and is responsible for virtually all
DNA damage-induced mutagenesis and the majority of spontaneous
mutagenesis. The human gene encodes an expected protein of 3,130
residues, about twice the size of the yeast protein, which has 1,504
amino acids. The 2 proteins are 29% identical in an amino-terminal
region of approximately 340 residues, 39% identical in a
carboxy-terminal region of approximately 850 residues, and 29% identical
in a 55-residue region in the middle of the 2 genes. The sequence of the
expected protein strongly predicted that it is the catalytic subunit of
a DNA polymerase of the polymerase-zeta type; the carboxy-terminal
domain possesses, in the right order, the 6 motifs characteristic of
eukaryotic DNA polymerases, most closely resembles yeast polymerase-zeta
among all polymerases in the GenBank database, and is different from the
human alpha (POLA; 312040), delta (POLD1; 174761), and epsilon (POLE;
174762) enzymes.

Xiao et al. (1998) identified human cDNA clones from 3 different
libraries whose deduced amino acid sequences share homology with yeast
REV3. The gene encodes an mRNA of more than 10 kb. Its expression varied
in different tissues and appeared to be elevated in some but not all of
the tumor cell lines examined.

In a study of genes involved in tumor suppression from 6q21, Morelli et
al. (1998) identified the same sequence as that reported by Gibbs et al.
(1998).

GENE FUNCTION

Gibbs et al. (1998) found that human cells expressing high levels of a
REV3 antisense RNA fragment grew normally, but showed little or no
ultraviolet (UV)-induced mutagenesis and were slightly more sensitive to
killing by UV. They concluded that the human gene therefore appears to
carry out a function similar to that of its yeast counterpart.

Murakumo et al. (2001) noted that, in S. cerevisiae, Rev3 is involved
with Rev1 (606134) and Rev7 (MAD2L2; 604094) in the error-prone
translesion synthesis reaction that frequently induces mutations at
damaged DNA lesions. They demonstrated direct interaction between human
REV3 and REV7 and between REV1 and REV7, as well as homodimerization
between REV7 molecules. The interaction between REV3 and REV7 was
mediated by residues 1847 to 1892 of REV3 and by residues 21 to 155 of
REV7. This region of REV7 was also implicated in REV1 binding and in
homodimerization. Murakumo et al. (2001) hypothesized that REV7 may
regulate the enzymatic activities of REV1 and REV3.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Morelli et al. (1998) determined that the
REV3L gene contains 33 exons, 3 of which are noncoding at the 5-prime
end, and spans approximately 200 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Xiao et al. (1998) mapped the REV3L gene to
chromosome 1p33-p32. However, Morelli et al. (1998) mapped the REV3L
gene to chromosome 6q21 by genomic sequence analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

O-Wang et al. (2002) stated that Rev3-deficient mouse embryos die around
midgestation of embryogenesis, which is accompanied by massive apoptosis
of embryonic cells. They found that Rev3 null mouse blastocycts were
unable to survive and grow in culture. Expression of a Rev3 transgene
restored their outgrowth and suppressed the apoptosis in Rev3 null
embryos, but the transgene was unable to rescue embryonic lethality.
Deficiency of p53 (191170) was also unable to rescue embryonic
lethality, suggesting that Rev3 null embryonic death occurs in a
p53-independent pathway.

611220	TITLE *611220 UNC45, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, B; UNC45B
;;SMUNC45
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

UNC45B plays a role in myoblast fusion and sarcomere organization (Price
et al., 2002).

CLONING

By database analysis using C. elegans unc45 sequence as probe, followed
by PCR of a human heart cDNA library, Price et al. (2002) cloned UNC45B,
which they called SMUNC45. The deduced 931-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 103.4 kD and shares 95% and 56% amino acid
identity with mouse Unc45b and human UNC45A (611219), respectively.
UNC45B contains an N-terminal triple TPR motif, a unique central region,
and a C-terminal UNC45/Cro1/She4p (UCS) domain. EST database analysis
showed human UNC45B expression in cDNA libraries derived mostly from
heart and tissues containing heart and skeletal muscle. The authors also
cloned mouse Unc45b, and Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected high expression in skeletal muscle, heart, and whole embryo,
with low levels detected in lung. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos
detected Unc45b expression in the heart at 8.75 days gestation. Unc45b
expression was not initially detected in proliferating mouse C2C12
skeletal muscle cells but appeared later during differentiation when
aligned myogenic cells were actively fusing.

GENE FUNCTION

Price et al. (2002) showed that antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of
mouse Unc45b mRNA expression reduced myoblast fusion and altered
sarcomere formation in C2C12 cells. The altered sarcomere organization
was not associated with any changes in skeletal myosin heavy chain
(MYH1; 160730) protein levels.

GENE STRUCTURE

Price et al. (2002) determined that the UNC45B gene contains 19 exons
spanning 38 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Price et al. (2002) mapped the UNC45B gene
to chromosome 17q11. They mapped the mouse Unc45b gene to the syntenic
region on mouse chromosome 11.

609317	TITLE *609317 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 36; TRIM36
;;RBCC728
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a B-box domain consensus sequence to screen EST databases for
novel TRIM family members, Reymond et al. (2001) identified and cloned
mouse and human TRIM36. The deduced protein contains an N-terminal RING
domain, B-box-1 and B-box-2 domains, and a coiled-coil region.

By sequencing a region of chromosome 5 duplicated in a renal cell
carcinoma, Balint et al. (2004) identified TRIM36, which they designated
RBCC728. They obtained the full-length cDNA by PCR of fetal brain and
adult kidney cDNA libraries. The deduced 728-amino acid protein has an
N-terminal RING finger C3HC4 structure, 2 B-boxes, a coiled-coil region,
a fibronectin type III (see 135600) domain and a C-terminal domain found
in SPRY proteins (see SPRY1; 602465). TRIM36 also contains a bipartite
nuclear localization signal. TRIM36 shares 26% amino acid identity with
MID1 (300552). Quantitative RT-PCR detected highest TRIM36 expression in
testis, followed by prostate and brain, with weak expression in kidney,
lung, and heart. TRIM36 expression was upregulated in some prostate
cancers compared with normal tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis of
recombinant and endogenous TRIM36 in COS-7 cells showed the protein
expressed in a slightly filamentous staining pattern in the cytoplasm.
TRIM36 often accumulated near sites of cell-cell contact, and mitotic
cells were negative for TRIM36 staining.

GENE STRUCTURE

Balint et al. (2004) determined that the TRIM36 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 55 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM36
gene to chromosome 5q22. By shotgun sequencing, Balint et al. (2004)
identified the TRIM36 gene within a BAC mapped to chromosome 5q22.3.

614218	TITLE *614218 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 81; WDR81
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Okazaki et al. (2004) cloned mouse Wdr81, which they designated
FLJ00182. The deduced protein contains 693 amino acids.

Gulsuner et al. (2011) stated that the longest isoform of the human
WDR81 gene, isoform 1, contains 1,941 amino acids. The protein contains
an N-terminal BEACH (Beige and Chediak-Higashi) domain, a MFS (major
facilitator superfamily) domain, and 6 C-terminal WD40 repeats. The
protein is predicted to be a transmembrane protein with 6
membrane-spanning domains. Human WDR81 was expressed in all brain
regions analyzed, with highest levels of expression in the cerebellum
and corpus callosum. Wdr81 was detected in Purkinje cells in the
cerebellum of mouse embryos, and was coexpressed with genes involved in
neuronal differentiation and projection, axonogenesis, and cell
morphogenesis, suggesting a role in development.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gulsuner et al. (2011) stated that the human WDR81 gene contains 10
exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the WDR81 gene to chromosome 17p13.3 based on an
alignment of the WDR81 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK091136) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Okazaki et al. (2004) mapped the mouse Wdr81 gene to chromosome 11.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with autosomal
recessive cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and dysequilibrium
syndrome-2 (CAMRQ2; 610185), Gulsuner et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous mutation in the WDR81 gene (P856L; 614218.0001). Homozygosity
for the mutation segregated with the phenotype. The mutation occurred in
a highly conserved residue and was not found in 549 controls. The
mutation was found by targeted sequencing of the candidate disease
region identified by linkage analysis. The family had originally been
reported by Turkmen et al. (2006) as having cerebellar hypoplasia,
mental retardation, and an inability to walk bipedally, resulting in
quadrupedal locomotion as a functional adaptation. Brain MRI of affected
individuals by Gulsuner et al. (2011) showed morphologic abnormalities
in the cerebellum and corpus callosum, in particular atrophy of
superior, middle, and inferior peduncles of the cerebellum. Structural
MRI showed additional morphometric abnormalities in several cortical
areas, including the corpus callosum, precentral gyrus, and several
Brodmann areas.

612870	TITLE *612870 PLECKSTRIN HOMOLOGY DOMAIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN; PHIP
;;DDB1- AND CUL4-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 14; DCAF14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PHIP binds the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of insulin receptor
substrate-1 (IRS1; 147545), modulates insulin signaling, and plays a
role in pancreatic beta cell growth and survival (Farhang-Fallah et al.,
2000; Podcheko et al., 2007).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse 10.5 day embryo cDNA library
using the rat Irs1 PH domain as bait, followed by screening mouse thymus
and human fetal brain cDNA libraries, Farhang-Fallah et al. (2000)
identified mouse and human PHIP. The deduced 902-amino acid mouse and
human proteins have a calculated molecular mass of 100 kD. Both have 2
predicted bromodomains that share 44% identity with the bromodomain of
mouse CREB-binding protein (CREBBP; 600140). Northern blot analysis of
adult mouse tissues detected a 7.0-kb transcript with widespread
expression. Western blot analysis of human myeloma cell lysates detected
a long 104-kD isoform and a shorter 97-kD isoform, which were predicted
to arise from alternative usage of 2 putative translation initiation
sites.

By database analysis, Podcheko et al. (2007) identified a 206-kD mouse
Phip isoform in pancreatic beta cells. By RT-PCR of MCF-7 cells, they
cloned a long isoform of human PHIP, which they called PHIP1. Human
PHIP1 shares 96% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. The
1,821-amino acid PHIP1 isoform has a predicted molecular mass of 206 kD
and contains 8 predicted WD40 repeats, 2 bromodomains, and 2 putative
nuclear localization signals. Quantitative PCR analysis detected mouse
Phip1 mRNA in all tissues examined, with highest expression in
pancreatic islets, brain, and skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence
studies localized Phip1 to the nucleus in mouse pancreatic islet cells,
which contain higher Phip1 expression than the surrounding acinar cells.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the PHIP gene to chromosome 6q14.1 based on an
alignment of the PHIP sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF310250) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Farhang-Fallah et al. (2000) used GST-fusion assay to demonstrate that
mouse Phip interacted specifically with the IRS1 PH domain and failed to
interact with PH domains from other proteins. Immunoprecipitation
studies detected interaction between endogenous mouse Phip and the IRS1
PH domain in both unstimulated and insulin-treated NIH3T3 cells
overexpressing the insulin receptor (INSR; 147670). Binding competition
analysis showed that the PHIP PH-binding region disrupted IRS1 tyrosine
phosphorylation, as well as insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activity.
Farhang-Fallah et al. (2000) concluded that PHIP is a protein ligand of
the IRS1 PH domain that can modulate insulin signaling.

Podcheko et al. (2007) determined that Phip1 potentiates IGF1 (IGF1;
147440) stimulated mitogenesis in pancreatic beta cells. In addition,
Phip1 induced transcriptional activation of the cyclin D2 (CCND2;
123833) promoter in a luciferase reporter assay. RNAi knockdown resulted
in inhibition of IRS2 (600797)-dependent mitogenesis. Inhibition of PKB
(AKT1; 164730) activity blocked the protective effect of Phip1 on free
fatty acid-induced apoptosis. Phip1 overexpression inhibited the
induction of apoptosis, induced PKB phosphorylation, and inhibited
caspase-9 (CASP9; 602234) and caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) activation.
Podcheko et al. (2007) concluded that Phip1 plays a role in regulation
of pancreatic beta cell growth and survival.

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to an intellectual disability phenotype has not been

macrocephaly, dysmorphic features including straight eyebrows,
strabismus, blepharophimosis, ptosis, a long philtrum and full lips,
tapered fingers, clinodactyly of fifth fingers, long toes, and a normal
brain on MRI, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous
3447T-G transversion, resulting in a tyr1149-to-ter (Y1149X)
substitution.

612115	TITLE *612115 RHO GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 3; ARHGEF3
;;XPLN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Rho-like GTPases (see RHOA; 165390), which are involved in a variety of
cellular processes, are activated by binding GTP and inactivated by
conversion of GTP to GDP by their intrinsic GTPase activity. Guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), such as ARHGEF3, accelerate the
GTPase activity of Rho GTPases by catalyzing their release of bound GDP
(Thiesen et al., 2000).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences encoding a Dbl (MCF2; 311030)
homology (DH) domain, followed by screening a neuronal teratocarcinoma
cDNA library and 5-prime RACE of adult human brain RNA, Thiesen et al.
(2000) obtained a full-length ARHGEF3 cDNA. The deduced 526-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 59.8 kD and contains the
tandem DH and pleckstrin (PLEK; 173570) homology (PH) domains
characteristic of RhoGEFs. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.8-kb
transcript in heart, brain, kidney, lung, pancreas, spleen, and skeletal
muscle.

By searching databases for sequences encoding ARHGEF-like domains,
followed by PCR of acute myeloid leukemia and total brain cDNA
libraries, Arthur et al. (2002) cloned ARHGEF3. They referred to ARHGEF3
as XPLN (pronounced 'zeppelin') for 'exchange factor found in platelets
and leukemic and neuronal libraries.' ARHGEF3 shares 99% and 94% amino
acid identity with its monkey and mouse orthologs, respectively. Western
blot analysis detected prominent ARHGEF3 expression in adult brain and
skeletal muscle, with weaker expression in heart and kidney. ARHGEF3
protein expression was also detected in human platelets, mouse
macrophages, and rat pheochromocytoma cells, but not in other cell lines
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro assays, Arthur et al. (2002) found that recombinant
ARHGEF3 stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on RHOA and RHOB
(165370), but not on RHOC (165380), RHOG (179505), RAC1 (602048), or
CDC42 (116952). Mutation analysis showed that the inability of ARHGEF3
to catalyze nucleotide exchange on RHOC was due to ile43 of RHOC, a
position occupied by valine in RHOA and RHOB. ARHGEF3 activated RHOA and
RHOB, but not RHOC, in transfected cells and stimulated assembly of
stress fibers and focal adhesions in mouse fibroblasts in a Rho kinase
(ROCK1; 601702)-dependent manner. ARHGEF3 also showed transforming
activity in cells expressing a permissive RAF (164760) mutant.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Thiesen et al. (2000) mapped the ARHGEF3 gene to chromosome
3p21-p13.

of the avian sarcoma virus CT10. A cDNA encoding the chicken cellular
homolog of v-crk was isolated by Reichman et al. (1992) and shown to
consist primarily of the SRC (190090) homology domains SH2 and SH3.
Matsuda et al. (1992) isolated 2 distinct human CRK cDNA species and
showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of the corresponding
polypeptides differed in their C termini. The 2 cDNA species were
considered to derive from the same genomic locus by alternative
splicing.

MAPPING

Fioretos et al. (1993) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
the CRK gene to chromosome 17p13. Deletion of this region of chromosome
17 is one of the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities in human
cancer. The TP53 gene (191170) maps to 17p13.1; Fioretos et al. (1993)
mapped the CRK oncogene to 17p13.3, which is a second region on 17p that
has been shown to manifest frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in a
number of different tumor types. Thus, the region is presumed to harbor
a tumor suppressor gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Feller et al. (1994) described the SRC homology domains SH2 and SH3 as
molecular adhesives on many proteins involved in signal transduction.
They reviewed the interactions of ABL (189980) and CRK as a model of SH2
and SH3 interaction.

Hallock et al. (2010) found that Crk and Crkl (602007) were recruited to
mouse skeletal muscle synapses and played redundant roles in synaptic
differentiation. Crk and Crkl bound the same tyrosine-phosphorylated
sequences in Dok7 (610285), a protein that functions downstream of agrin
(AGRN; 103320) and muscle-specific receptor kinase (MUSK; 601296) in
synapse formation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cardoso et al. (2003) completed a physical and transcriptional map of
the 17p13.3 region from LIS1 to the telomere. Using Cardoso et al.
(2003), they mapped the deletion size in 19 children with ILS (607432),
11 children with Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS; 164762), and 4 children
with 17p13.3 deletions not involving LIS1. They showed that the critical
region that differentiates ILS from MDS at the molecular level can be
reduced to 400 kb. Using somatic cell hybrids from selected patients,
the authors identified 8 genes that are consistently deleted in patients
classified as having MDS. These genes include ABR (600365),
14-3-3-epsilon (605066), CRK, MYO1C (606538), SKIP (603055), PITPNA
(600174), SCARF1, RILP, PRP8 (607300), and SERPINF1 (172860). In
addition, deletion of the genes CRK and 14-3-3-epsilon delineates
patients with the most severe lissencephaly grade. On the basis of
recent functional data and the creation of a mouse model suggesting a
role for 14-3-3-epsilon in cortical development, Cardoso et al. (2003)
suggested that deletion of 1 or both of these genes in combination with
deletion of LIS1 may contribute to the more severe form of lissencephaly
seen only in patients with MDS.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hallock et al. (2010) found that knockout of both Crk and Crkl in mouse
skeletal muscle, but not of either gene alone, caused perinatal
lethality. Lungs from Crk- and Crkl-deficient newborns failed to expand.
Embryonic day-18.5 muscle from Crk- and Crkl-deficient mice lacked
innervation and showed severe defects in presynaptic and postsynaptic
differentiation.

610739	TITLE *610739 TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEAT-CONTAINING GENE 6A; TNRC6A
;;GLYCINE/TRYPTOPHAN REPEAT PROTEIN, 182-KD; GW182;;
KIAA1460
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TNRC6A, or GW182, is a component of a cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein
complex involved in regulating mRNA silencing, stability, and
translation (Schneider et al., 2006).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned TNRC6A, which they designated
KIAA1460. RT-PCR ELISA detected TNRC6A expression in all tissues and
specific brain regions examined, with highest expression in whole adult
brain.

Using autoimmune sera from a patient with a motor and sensory
polyneuropathy to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed by database
analysis and PCR, Eystathioy et al. (2002) cloned full-length TNRC6A,
which they called GW182. The deduced 1,709-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 182 kD. It contains a central nuclear
localization signal, a C-terminal RNA recognition motif, numerous
glycine/tryptophan (GW) repeats, and multiple phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb GW182 transcript in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in heart. Labeling with radioactive
phosphate indicated that GW182 is a phosphoprotein. Immunolocalization
in HepG2 cells showed GW182 in unique membrane-free cytoplasmic bodies
that Eystathioy et al. (2002) called GW bodies. The number of GW bodies
ranged from 0 in mitotic cells to 30 in some interphase cells, and they
varied in size.

Schneider et al. (2006) stated that the 1,690-amino acid GW182 protein
has a GW-rich N-terminal domain, a central glutamine-rich region, and a
C-terminal RNA recognition motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Eystathioy et al. (2002) found that anti-GW182 antibodies
immunoprecipitated a wide range of mRNAs. They proposed that GW bodies
are ribonucleoprotein complexes that may be involved in regulating
transcripts required for cell growth and homeostasis.

Eystathioy et al. (2003) found that the most common clinical diagnosis
of patients with anti-GW182 antibodies was Sjogren syndrome (270150),
followed by mixed motor/sensory neuropathy and systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE; 152700).

Using immunogold electron microscopy, Yang et al. (2004) showed that GW
bodies were 100 to 300 nm in diameter and that they lacked a lipid
membrane. The structures appeared to comprise clusters of strands 8 to
10 nm in diameter. Using synchronized HeLa cells, Yang et al. (2004)
found that GW bodies were small in early S phase and larger during late
S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The majority of GW bodies
disassembled prior to mitosis, and small GW bodies reassembled in early
G1. Proliferating mouse cells contained larger, brighter, and more
numerous GW bodies and had up to 5-fold more total Gw182 protein than
quiescent cells. In vitro knockdown of Gw182 led to the disappearance of
GW bodies.

Jakymiw et al. (2005) found that endogenous AGO2 (EIF2C2; 606229) and
transfected small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) accumulated in GW bodies in
HeLa cells, and that GW182 interacted with AGO2. An N-terminal fragment
of GW182 did not localize to GW bodies, and this construct disrupted GW
bodies in HeLa cells and interfered with the silencing capability of an
siRNA specific to lamin-A/C (LMNA; 150330). Jakymiw et al. (2005)
concluded that GW182 and/or the microenvironment of the cytoplasmic GW
bodies contribute to the RNA-induced silencing complex and to RNA
silencing.

Schneider et al. (2006) found that gawky, the Drosophila ortholog of the
human GW182 family, localized to punctate, cytoplasmic foci in an
RNA-dependent manner. Reducing gawky activity by mutation or antibody
injection during syncytial embryo development led to abnormal nuclear
divisions, demonstrating an early requirement of GW body-mediated
cytoplasmic mRNA regulation.

By microarray analysis, Behm-Ansmant et al. (2006) found that depletion
of Gw182 led to changes in the mRNA expression profile in Drosophila S2
cells similar to those observed following Ago1 depletion. When Gw182 was
bound to a reporter transcript, it silenced its expression, bypassing
the requirement for Ago1, and Gw182 both repressed protein expression
and promoted mRNA decay. Behm-Ansmant et al. (2006) also showed that the
N-terminal GW repeats of Gw182 interacted with the PIWI domain of Ago1.
They concluded that GW182 links the microRNA pathway to mRNA degradation
by interacting with AGO1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eystathioy et al. (2002) determined that the TNRC6A gene contains 22
exons and spans 46 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the TNRC6A
gene to chromosome 16. Eystathioy et al. (2002) mapped the TNRC6A gene
to chromosome 16p12 by genomic sequence analysis.

614705	TITLE *614705 SLIT-ROBO RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 2D; SRGAP2D
DESCRIPTION The SRGAP2D gene represents a human-specific partial duplication of the
SRGAP2A gene (SRGAP2; 606524).

CLONING

During the assembly of BAC contigs corresponding to SRGAP2A paralogs
SRGAP2B (614703) and SRGAP2C (614704), Dennis et al. (2012) identified a
single BAC clone that harbored sequence for an SRPGAP2 paralog (exons
7-9) but did not share greater than 99.9% identity with any of the 3
contigs, suggesting that a fourth SRGAP2 duplicate existed (SRGAP2D).
Dennis et al. (2012) determined that the SRGAP2D gene originated from
the incomplete duplication of the SRGAP2B gene approximately 1 million
years ago.

Using sequence data from 661 individuals from 14 populations from the
1000 Genomes project, Dennis et al. (2012) estimated the diploid copy
number of the SRGAP2 paralogs. The SRGAP2D and SRGAP2B copies varied
from 0 to 4 copies among all individuals tested. The ancestral SRGAP2
(SRGAP2A) and the derived SRGAP2C copy are fixed at diploid copy number
2 across all humans assayed. Dennis et al. (2012) identified 3
individuals who were homozygously deleted for SRGAP2B, as well as normal
individuals homozygously deleted for SRGAP2D, the granddaughter copy
with an acquired internal deletion of exons 2 and 3.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dennis et al. (2012) determined that the SRGAP2D gene is derived from
the 9-exon SRGAP2B gene and contains a 115-kb deletion corresponding to
exons 2 and 3 relative to the SRGAP2B gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Dennis et al. (2012) noted that while the SRGAP2D gene shows evidence of
transcription, it is unlikely that it and its neighboring paralog
SRGAP2B are functional. The transcripts produced by SRGAP2D lack 2
internal exons leading to a premature termination codon. SRGAP2B has a
markedly reduced expression in human brain compared to SRGAP2C. Both
SRGAP2B and SRGAP2D are highly copy number polymorphic, with normal
individuals identified that completely lack these paralogs.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Dennis et al. (2012) mapped the SRGAP2D gene to chromosome
1q21.1 proximal to the SRGAP2B gene.

EVOLUTION

Dennis et al. (2012) leveraged a haploid hydatidiform mole to identify
highly identical sequences missing from the reference genome and
confirmed that the SRGAP2 gene duplicated 3 times exclusively in humans.
Dennis et al. (2012) showed that the promoter and first 9 exons of
SRGAP2 duplicated from 1q32.1 (SRGAP2A) to 1q21.1 (SRGAP2B)
approximately 3.4 million years ago. Two larger duplications later
copied SRGAP2B to chromosome 1p12 (SRGAP2C) and to proximal 1q21.1
(SRGAP2D) approximately 2.4 and 1 million years ago, respectively.
Dennis et al. (2012) observed that SRGAP2B, SRGAP2C, and SRGAP2D were
absent from all assayed nonhuman great apes but were present in both the
Neanderthal and Denisova genomes. Dennis et al. (2012) therefore
concluded that no new SRGAP2 duplications have occurred since Homo
sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis diverged about 1 million years ago.

;;RNA, HBII-52 SMALL NUCLEOLAR;;
snoRNA, HBII-52;;
MBII-52, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for small non-mRNAs specifically expressed in mouse brain,
followed by searching human sequence databases, Cavaille et al. (2000)
identified SNORD115, which they called HBII-52. HBII-52 is a C/D box
small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) with a 5-prime C box, followed by a D-prime
box, a C-prime box, an antisense box, and a 3-prime D box. Northern blot
analysis detected expression of HBII-52 in human brain, but not in
liver, muscle, lung, kidney, and heart. Cavaille et al. (2000)
determined that HBII-52 maps to an imprinted region of chromosome 15
associated with Angelman syndrome (AS; 105830) and Prader-Willi syndrome
(PWS; 176270). They concluded that HBII-52 is a paternally imprinted
gene, since it was expressed in cortex RNA from a normal control brain
and from an AS patient with a maternally inherited deletion, but was
absent from cortex RNA from a PWS patient with a paternally inherited
deletion and from a mouse model of PWS.

GENE FUNCTION

Cavaille et al. (2000) identified an 18-nucleotide phylogenetically
conserved region in HBII-52 complementary to a critical segment of the
serotonin-2C receptor mRNA (HTR2C; 312861), suggesting that HBII-52 may
have a role in processing HTR2C mRNA.

The snoRNA HBII-52 is contained within the Prader-Willi deleted region
on chromosome 15q11 and exhibits sequence complementarity to the
alternatively spliced exon Vb of the serotonin receptor HTR2C. Kishore
and Stamm (2006) found that HBII-52 regulates alternative splicing of
HTR2C by binding to a silencing element in exon Vb. Prader-Willi
syndrome patients do not express HBII-52. They have different HTR2C mRNA
isoforms than healthy individuals. Kishore and Stamm (2006) concluded
that a snoRNA regulates the processing of an mRNA expressed from a gene
located on a different chromosome, and the results indicate that a
defect in pre-mRNA processing contributes to the Prader-Willi syndrome.

Using bioinformatic predictions and experimental verification, Kishore
et al. (2010) identified 5 pre-mRNAs (DPM2, 603564; TAF1, 313650;
RALGPS1, 614444; PBRM1, 606083; and CRHR1, 122561) containing
alternative exons that are regulated by MBII-52, the mouse homolog of
HBII-52. Analysis of a single member of the MBII-52 cluster of snoRNAs
by RNase protection and Northern blot analysis showed that the MBII-52
expressing unit generated shorter RNAs that originate from the
full-length MBII-52 snoRNA through additional processing steps. These
novel RNAs associated with hnRNPs and not with proteins associated with
canonical C/D box snoRNAs. Kishore et al. (2010) concluded that not a
traditional C/D box snoRNA MBII-52, but a processed version lacking the
snoRNA stem, is the predominant MBII-52 RNA missing in Prader-Willi
syndrome. This processed snoRNA functions in alternative splice site
selection.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cavaille et al. (2000) identified 47
tandem copies of the SNORD115 gene on chromosome 15q11-q13. The SNORD115
copies are slightly divergent units of about 1.9 kb regularly spaced
within a stretch of 99 kb.

Runte et al. (2001) determined that HBII-52 and several other snoRNAs
are encoded within intronic segments of the SNURF-SNRPN (182279)
transcript. HBII-52 is located within introns between exons 63 and 144
of SNURF-SNRPN.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Runte et al. (2005) found that individuals with complete deletion of all
copies of HBII-52 had no obvious clinical phenotype, suggesting that
HBII-52 does not play a major role in PWS.

Sato et al. (2007) reported a Japanese family in which a boy with AS and
his asymptomatic mother and maternal grandfather all had a 1,487-kb
deletion on chromosome 15, encompassing HBII-52. The mother was
evaluated with regard to diagnostic criteria for PWS but the diagnosis
was considered unlikely, suggesting that HBII-52 may not be important in
the pathogenesis of PWS.

ANIMAL MODEL

In a mouse model for PWS lacking expression of Mbii-52, Doe et al.
(2009) showed an increase in editing, but not alternative splicing, of
the Htr2c pre-RNA. This change in posttranscriptional modification was
associated with alterations in a number of brain serotonin-related
behaviors, including impulsive responding, locomotor activity and
reactivity to palatable foodstuffs. For marble burying, a behavior not
related to brain serotonin, loss of Mbii-52 was without effect. The
specificity of the behavioral effects to changes in Htr2c function was
further confirmed using drug challenges. These data illustrated the
physiologic consequences of altered RNA editing of Htr2c linked to
Mbii-52 loss that may underlie specific aspects of the complex PWS
phenotype and point to an important functional role for this imprinted
snoRNA.

600799	TITLE *600799 BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN RECEPTOR, TYPE II; BMPR2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a family of proteins that induce
bone formation at extracellular sites in vivo. BMPs act on osteoblasts
and chondrocytes as well as other cell types, including neurocells, and
they play important roles in embryonal development. Members of the BMP
family include BMP1 (112264) to BMP6 (112266), BMP7 (112267), also
called osteogenic protein-1 (OP1), OP2 (BMP8; 602284), and others. BMPs
belong to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily,
which includes, in addition to the TGF-betas (e.g., 190180),
activin/inhibins (e.g., alpha-inhibin; 147380), mullerian inhibiting
substance (600957), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor
(600837). TGF-betas and activins transduce their signals through the
formation of heteromeric complexes of 2 different types of serine
(threonine) kinase receptors: type I receptors of about 50 to 55 kD and
type II receptors of about 70 to 80 kD. Type II receptors bind ligands
in the absence of type I receptors, but they require their respective
type I receptors for signaling, whereas type I receptors require their
respective type II receptors for ligand binding. BMPR2 is a type II
receptor for BMPs.

CLONING

Rosenzweig et al. (1995) reported the cDNA cloning and characterization
of a human type II receptor for BMPs, which they called BMPR II, that is
distantly related to DAF4, a BMP type II receptor in Caenorhabditis
elegans.

MAPPING

By analysis of a monochromosome hybrid mapping panel and by FISH, Astrom
et al. (1999) mapped the BMPR2 gene to chromosome 2q33-q34.

GENE FUNCTION

Rosenzweig et al. (1995) showed that, in transfected COS-1 cells, BMP7
and, less efficiently, BMP4 (112262) bound to BMPR II. BMPR II bound
ligands only weakly alone, but the binding was facilitated by the
presence of previously identified type I receptors for BMPs. A
transcriptional activation signal was transduced by BMPR II in the
presence of type I receptors after stimulation by BMP7.

In an investigation of the molecular bases of common nonfamilial forms
of pulmonary hypertension, Du et al. (2003) evaluated the pattern of
expression of several genes in lung biopsy specimens from patients with
pulmonary hypertension and from normotensive control patients. The genes
included angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1; 601667), a protein involved in the
recruitment of smooth muscle cells around blood vessels; TIE2 (600221),
the endothelial-specific receptor for angiopoietin-1; bone morphogenetic
protein receptor 1A (BMPR1A; 601299); and BMPR2. The effect of
angiopoietin-1 on the modulation of BMPR expression was also evaluated
in subcultures of human pulmonary arteriolar endothelial cells. The
expression of angiopoietin-1 mRNA and the protein itself and the
phosphorylation of TIE2 were strongly upregulated in the lungs of
patients with various forms of pulmonary hypertension, correlating
directly with the severity of disease. A mechanistic link between
familial and acquired pulmonary hypertension was demonstrated by the
finding that angiopoietin-1 shuts off the expression of BMPR1A, a
transmembrane protein required for BMPR2 signaling, in pulmonary
arteriolar endothelial cells. Similarly, the expression of BMPR1A was
severely reduced in the lungs of patients with various forms of acquired
as well as primary nonfamilial pulmonary hypertension. The findings
suggested that all forms of pulmonary hypertension are linked by defects
in the signaling pathway involving angiopoietin-1, TIE2, BMPR1A, and
BMPR2, and consequently identified specific molecular targets for
therapeutic intervention.

Machado et al. (2003) determined that TCTEL1 (601554), a light chain of
the motor complex dynein, interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of
BMPR2 and was also phosphorylated by BMPR2, a function disrupted by
primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH1; 178600)-causing mutations within
exon 12 (e.g., 600799.0002). BMPR2 and TCTEL1 colocalized to endothelium
and smooth muscle within the media of pulmonary arterioles, key sites of
vascular remodeling in PPH. The authors proposed that loss of
interaction and lack of phosphorylation of TCTEL1 by BMPR2 may
contribute to the pathogenesis of PPH.

Using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analyses, Cejalvo
et al. (2007) demonstrated that human thymus and cortical epithelial
cells produced BMP2 (112261) and BMP4 and that both thymocytes and
thymic epithelium expressed the molecular machinery to respond to these
proteins. The receptors BMPR1A and BMPR2 were mainly expressed by
cortical thymocytes, whereas BMPR1B (603248) was expressed in the
majority of thymocytes. BMP4 treatment of chimeric human-mouse fetal
thymic organ cultures seeded with CD34 (142230)-positive human thymic
progenitors resulted in reduced cell recovery and inhibition of
differentiation of CD4 (186940)/CD8 (see 186910) double-negative to
double-positive stages. Cejalvo et al. (2007) concluded that BMP2 and
BMP4 have a role in human T-cell differentiation.

Tsang et al. (2009) showed that mammalian NIPA1 (608145) is an inhibitor
of BMP signaling. NIPA1 physically interacted with the BMPR2, and this
interaction did not require the cytoplasmic tail of BMPR2. The mechanism
by which NIPA1 inhibited BMP signaling involved downregulation of BMP
receptors by promoting their endocytosis and lysosomal degradation.
Disease-associated mutant versions of NIPA1 altered the trafficking of
BMPR2 and were less efficient at promoting BMPR2 degradation than
wildtype NIPA1. In addition, 2 other members of the endosomal group of
hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) proteins, spastin (SPAST; 604277)
and spartin (SPG20; 607111), inhibited BMP signaling. Since BMP
signaling is important for distal axonal function, Tsang et al. (2009)
proposed that dysregulation of BMP signaling could be a unifying
pathologic component in this endosomal group of HSPs, and perhaps of
importance in other conditions in which distal axonal degeneration is
found.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta and BMPs is
mediated by miR21 (611020). miR21 downregulates PDCD4 (608610), which in
turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth muscle contractile genes.
Surprisingly, TGF-beta and BMP signaling promoted a rapid increase in
expression of mature miR21 through a posttranscriptional step, promoting
the processing of primary transcripts of miR21 (pri-miR21) into
precursor miR21 (pre-miR21) by the Drosha complex (608828). TGF-beta and
BMP-specific SMAD signal transducers SMAD1 (601595), SMAD2 (601366),
SMAD3 (603109), and SMAD5 (603110) are recruited to pri-miR21 in a
complex with the RNA helicase p68 (DDX5; 180630), a component of the
Drosha microprocessor complex. The shared cofactor SMAD4 (600993) is not
required for this process. Davis et al. (2008) concluded that regulation
of microRNA biogenesis by ligand-specific SMAD proteins is critical for
control of the vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype and potentially for
SMAD4-independent responses mediated by the TGF-beta and BMP signaling
pathways.

In a follow-up to the report of Davis et al. (2008), Drake et al. (2011)
found that BMPR2 was essential for the SMAD-mediated miR processing.
Loss of SMAD9 (603295) also affected miR processing in smooth muscle
cells and in endothelial cells, but it did not affect canonical BMP
signaling. Knockdown of individual receptor SMADs 1, 5, and 9 decreased
levels of processed miR21 levels in both types of cells, suggesting that
the miR processing pathway forms a complex.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The International PPH Consortium et al. (2000) and Deng et al. (2000)
reported that mutations in the BMPR2 gene can cause primary pulmonary
hypertension (PPH), a locus for which resides on chromosome 2q33 (PPH1;
178600). BMPR2 mutations were found in 7 of 8 of the PPH1 families
exhibiting linkage to markers adjacent to BMPR2 by the International PPH
Consortium et al. (2000) and in 9 of 19 of the families exhibiting
linkage and/or haplotype sharing with markers adjacent to BMPR2 by Deng
et al. (2000). Both groups reported heterogeneous BMPR2 mutations that
included termination, frameshift, and nonconservative missense changes
in amino acid sequence.

Thomson et al. (2000) analyzed the BMPR2 gene in 50 unrelated patients
with apparent sporadic PPH and identified 11 different heterozygous
mutations in 13 of the 50 PPH patients, including 3 missense, 3 nonsense
(see, e.g., 600799.0019), and 5 frameshift mutations. Analysis of
parental DNA was possible in 5 cases and showed 3 occurrences of
paternal transmission and 2 of de novo mutation of the BMPR2 gene.
Thomson et al. (2000) noted that because of low penetrance, in the
absence of detailed genealogic data, familial cases may be overlooked.

Machado et al. (2001) reported the molecular spectrum of BMPR2 mutations
in 47 families with PPH and in 3 patients with sporadic PPH. In the
cohort of patients, they identified 22 novel mutations, including 4
partial deletions, distributed throughout the BMPR2 gene. The majority
(58%) of mutations were predicted to lead to a premature termination
codon. In vitro expression analysis demonstrated loss of BMPR2 function
for a number of the identified mutations. These data suggested that
haploinsufficiency represents the common molecular mechanism in PPH.
Marked variability of the age at onset of disease was observed both
within and between families. The observed overall range for the age at
onset of symptoms of PPH was 1 to 60 years. In 1 family, the age at
onset for the 8 affected individuals ranged from 14 to 60 years. The
authors interpreted these observations as indicating that additional
factors, genetic and/or environmental, may be required for the
development of the clinical phenotype.

Most patients with primary pulmonary hypertension are thought to have
sporadic, not inherited, disease. Because clinical disease develops in
only 10 to 20% of persons carrying the gene for familial primary
pulmonary hypertension, Newman et al. (2001) hypothesized that many
patients with apparently sporadic primary pulmonary hypertension may
actually have familial primary pulmonary hypertension. Over a period of
20 years, they developed a registry of 67 families affected by familial
primary pulmonary hypertension. They discovered shared ancestry among 5
subfamilies, including 394 known members spanning several generations,
which were traced back to a founding couple in the mid-1800s. PPH had
been diagnosed in 18 family members, 12 of whom were first thought to
have sporadic disease. In 7 of the 18, the initial misdiagnosis was
another form of cardiopulmonary disease. The cys118-to-trp mutation
(600799.0005) was found in 6 members affected by PPH and in 6
individuals who were from the pedigree recognized as being carriers.

To determine the mechanism of altered BMPR2 function in primary
pulmonary hypertension, Rudarakanchana et al. (2002) transiently
transfected pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells with mutant BMPR2
constructs and fusion proteins. Substitution of cysteine residues in the
ligand binding (i.e., 600799.0005, 600799.0016) or kinase (600799.0006)
domain prevented trafficking of BMPR2 to the cell surface, and reduced
binding of radiolabeled BMP4. In addition, transfection of
cysteine-substituted BMPR2 markedly reduced basal and BMP4-stimulated
transcriptional activity of a BMP/SMAD-responsive luciferase reporter
gene (3GC2wt-Lux), compared with wildtype BMPR2, suggesting a
dominant-negative effect of these mutants on SMAD signaling. In
contrast, BMPR2 containing noncysteine substitutions in the kinase
domain (600799.0007, 600799.0008, 600799.0013) were localized to the
cell membrane, although these also suppressed the activity of
3GC2wt-Lux. Interestingly, BMPR2 mutations within the cytoplasmic tail
(600799.0002) trafficked to the cell surface, but retained the ability
to activate 3GC2wt-Lux. Transfection of mutant, but not wildtype,
constructs into a mouse epithelial cell line led to activation of p38
MAPK (MAPK14; 600289) and increased serum-induced proliferation compared
with the wildtype receptor, which was partly p38 MAPK-dependent. The
authors concluded that mutations in BMPR2 heterogeneously inhibit
BMP/SMAD-mediated signaling by diverse molecular mechanisms. However,
all mutants studied demonstrate a gain of function involving
upregulation of p38 MAPK-dependent pro-proliferative pathways.

Humbert et al. (2002) analyzed the BMPR2 gene in 33 unrelated patients
with sporadic PPH and 2 sisters with PPH, all of whom had taken
fenfluramine derivatives. Three BMPR2 mutations (see, e.g., 600799.0020)
were identified in 3 (9%) of the 33 unrelated patients, and a fourth
mutation (R211X; 600799.0019) was identified in the 2 sisters. The
latter mutation, as well as 1 of the sporadic mutations, had previously
been identified in patients with PPH unassociated with fenfluramine
derivatives.

In a family in which the proband had pulmonary venoocclusive disease
(PVOD; 265450) and her mother had pulmonary hypertension, Runo et al.
(2003) analyzed the BMPR2 gene and identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion (600799.0021) in the proband and her unaffected sister. DNA was
not available from their mother, who had known pulmonary hypertension
and died of right heart failure, or from the maternal grandparents.

In a patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension and PVOD, Machado et
al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a nonsense mutation
(600799.0022) the BMPR2 gene.

In 25 families with PPH and 106 patients with sporadic PPH, all of whom
were negative for mutations in the BMPR2 gene by DHPLC analysis or
direct sequencing, Aldred et al. (2006) performed multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to detect gross
BMPR2 rearrangements. Ten different deletions were identified in 7
families and 6 sporadic cases (see, e.g., 600799.0023-600799.0025). One
patient with familial PPH had histologic features of pulmonary
venoocclusive disease and was found to have a deletion of exon 2 of the
BMPR2 gene (600799.0023); the exon 2 deletion was also identified in an
unrelated family with PPH and no known evidence of PVOD. Aldred et al.
(2006) noted that 2 large deletions were predicted to result in null
alleles (see 600799.0025), providing support for the hypothesis that the
predominant molecular mechanism for disease predisposition is
haploinsufficiency.

Phillips et al. (2008) studied SNP genotypes of TGF-beta (190180) in
BMPR2 mutation carriers with pulmonary hypertension and examined the age
of diagnosis and penetrance of the pulmonary hypertension phenotype.
BMPR2 heterozygotes with least active -509 or codon 10 TGFB1 SNPs had
later mean age at diagnosis of familial pulmonary arterial hypertension
(39.5 and 43.2 years, respectively), than those with more active
genotypes (31.6 and 33.1 years, P = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively).
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that those with less active SNPs had later
age at diagnosis. BMPR2 mutation heterozygotes with nonsense-mediated
decay (NMD)-resistant BMPR2 mutations and the least, intermediate, and
most active -509 TGFB1 SNP phenotypes had penetrances of 33%, 72%, and
80%, respectively (P = 0.003), whereas those with 0-1, 2, or 3-4 active
SNP alleles had penetrances of 33%, 72%, and 75% (P = 0.005). Phillips
et al. (2008) concluded that the TGFB1 SNPs studied modulate age at
diagnosis and penetrance of familial pulmonary arterial hypertension in
BMPR2 mutation heterozygotes, likely by affecting TGFB/BMP signaling
imbalance. The authors considered this modulation an example of
synergistic heterozygosity.

Using enzymatic and fluorescence activity-based techniques, Nasim et al.
(2008) demonstrated that PPH-causing nonsense and frameshift BMPR2
mutations (see, e.g., 600799.0002) trigger NMD, providing further
evidence that haploinsufficiency is a major molecular consequence of
disease-related BMPR2 mutations. Missense mutations (see, e.g.,
600799.0006, 600799.0007, and 600799.0013) resulted in heterogeneous
functional defects in BMPR2 activity, including impaired phosphorylation
of the type 1 receptors BMPR1A and BMPR1B (603248), reduced
receptor-receptor interactions, and altered receptor complex
stoichiometry leading to perturbation of downstream signaling pathways.
Nasim et al. (2008) concluded that the intracellular domain of BMPR2 is
both necessary and sufficient for receptor complex interaction, and
suggested that stoichiometric imbalance, due to either
haploinsufficiency or loss of optimal receptor-receptor interactions,
impairs BMPR2-mediated signaling in PPH.

In a cohort of 48 patients with PAH, 24 of whom had histologic evidence
of PVOD, Montani et al. (2008) identified mutations in the BMPR2 gene in
2 patients with PVOD (600799.0027 and 600799.0028) and in 4 patients
with no evidence of PVOD.

In pulmonary endothelial cells derived from 2 of 3 PPH1 patients with
BMPR2 mutations, Drake et al. (2011) found loss of miR21 induction in
response to BMP9. These cells also showed greater proliferation compared
to controls; overexpression of miR21 induced growth suppression.
However, canonical BMP signaling was only mildly attenuated in these
cells. The findings suggested that disruption of the noncanonical
BMP-mediated pathway resulting in aberrant miR processing may play an
important role in the pathogenesis of PPH.

BMPR2, 1-BP DEL, 2579T

In a family with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH1; 178600), the
International PPH Consortium et al. (2000) reported deletion of a T in
an ATT repeat (2579delT) in exon 12 of the BMPR2 gene. This frameshift
mutation was predicted to result in premature termination after 10 amino
acid residues. The resulting truncation includes the large cytoplasmic
domain of the 1,038-amino acid BMPR2 protein. The authors concluded that
this mutation is likely to impede heteromeric receptor complex formation
at the cell surface, a requirement for normal signal transduction. They
also concluded that the mechanism of PPH1 causation may be either
haploinsufficiency or a dominant-negative mechanism. In a family with
primary pulmonary hypertension, Deng et al. (2000) independently
identified the 2579delT mutation.

was caused by a C-to-T transition at base 2695. This termination

BMPR2, EX10DEL

In 2 sibs and an unrelated pediatric patient with primary pulmonary
hypertension (PPH1; 178600), Aldred et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for deletion of exon 10 of the BMPR2 gene, resulting in
loss of 45 amino acids from the kinase domain. The deletion was
predicted to cause a frameshift and premature termination of exon 11
that was expected to result in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). The sibs
inherited the mutation from their unaffected father; in the other case,
the mutation was inherited from the unaffected mother.

PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1
BMPR2, EX1-13DEL

In a patient with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH1; 178600), Aldred
et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a deletion of exons 1
through 13 in the BMPR2 gene, confirmed to extend into the 5-prime
untranslated region and predicted to result in a complete null allele.
The mutation was not found in either parent.

PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, PRIMARY, 1, WITH HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA
BMPR2, GLN433TER

In a woman with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH1; 178600) diagnosed
at age 24 years, Rigelsky et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous
1297C-T transition in exon 10 of the BMPR2 gene, resulting in a
gln433-to-ter (Q433X) substitution. She developed massive hemoptysis at
age 35, prompting the discovery of multiple pulmonary arteriovenous
malformations consistent with a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic
telangiectasia (HHT). She also had recurrent epistaxis and nasal
telangiectasia. The patient was adopted, and there was no family history
available. Rigelsky et al. (2008) noted that, although PAH with HHT had
usually only been associated with mutations in the ACVRL1 gene (601284),
their patient was the first report of PAH and HHT associated with a
mutation in the BMPR2 gene. The findings indicated a common molecular
pathogenesis in PAH and HHT, most likely dysregulated BMP9 (GDF2;
605120) signaling.

PULMONARY VENOOCCLUSIVE DISEASE
BMPR2, ASN202TYR

Montani et al. (2008) reported a patient with pulmonary artery
hypertension who had histologic evidence of pulmonary venoocclusive
disease (PVOD; 265450) and a heterozygous 604A-T transversion in exon 5
of the BMPR2 gene, resulting in an asn202-to-tyr (N202Y) substitution.

PULMONARY VENOOCCLUSIVE DISEASE
BMPR2, GLU195TER

Montani et al. (2008) reported a patient with pulmonary artery
hypertension who had histologic evidence of pulmonary venoocclusive
disease (PVOD; 265450) and a heterozygous 583G-T transversion in exon 5
of the BMPR2 gene, resulting in a glu195-to-ter (E195X) substitution.

;;JUMONJI, AT-RICH INTERACTIVE DOMAIN 1C; JARID1C;;
SELECTED cDNA ON X, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; SMCX;;
XE169;;
DXS1272E
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KDM5C gene encodes a specific H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 demethylase, and
acts as a transcriptional repressor through the RE-1-silencing
transcription factor (REST) complex (Tahiliani et al., 2007).

CLONING

Wu et al. (1994) reported the isolation and characterization of cDNAs
for XE169, a non-pseudoautosomal region (PAR)-encoded human gene. The
sequence appeared to represent a full-length or nearly full-length cDNA
for the gene. Alternative splicing generates 2 distinct transcripts,
either containing or missing 9 nucleotides, which in turn predicts 2
XE169 protein isoforms composed of 1,557 and 1,560 amino acids,
respectively. XE169 is expressed in multiple human tissues, and
homologous sequences exist on the human Y chromosome and in the genomes
of 5 other eutherian mammals examined. RT-PCR analysis of somatic cell
hybrids containing either an active or an inactive human X chromosome on
a rodent background demonstrated that XE169 escapes X inactivation.

Jensen et al. (2005) reported that the JARID1C protein shares amino acid
identity of 85%, 51%, and 47% with JARID1D/SMCY (426000), JARID1A
(180202), and JARID1B (605393), respectively. The JARID1C protein
contains several domains conserved among the JARID proteins, including a
JmjN domain, an Arid/Bright domain, a JmjC domain, a C5HC2 zinc finger
domain, and PHD zinc finger domains. Northern blot analysis detected
varying expression of a 6.0-kb transcript in almost all adult human
tissues examined, with strongest expression in brain and skeletal muscle
and weakest expression in heart and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

The JARID1C gene was thought to escape X inactivation. Agulnik et al.
(1994) observed that in hamster/human hybrids, Jarid1c was expressed
when either an active or an inactive human X chromosome was present.
Furthermore, 2 alleles of Smcx were found to be expressed in t(16;X)16H
female mice despite the intact X chromosome being inactive in all cells.
Lingenfelter et al. (1998) showed that Smcx is susceptible to complete X
inactivation in a portion of mouse embryonic cells. Furthermore, Smcx
inactivation persists in some cells at least until 13.5 days postcoitum.
A highly variable Smcx expression found during mouse development
progressively disappears in adult tissues where nearly equal expression
between alleles is observed. Sheardown et al. (1996) demonstrated that
the mouse Jarid1c gene exhibits partial X inactivation in embryos, in
extraembryonic lineages, and in several adult tissues, showing an
expression of 20 to 70% from the inactive, compared with the active, X
allele. Xu et al. (2002) observed that Jarid1c and Jarid1d are expressed
in mouse brain in a sex-specific fashion; in adult mouse brain, Jarid1c
is expressed at a significantly higher level in females than in males,
and expression of Jarid1d in males was not sufficient to compensate for
the female bias in X-gene expression. Therefore, Jensen et al. (2005)
suggested that the X-Y gene pair JARID1C and JARID1D may not be
functionally equivalent, suggesting an indispensable role for JARID1C in
normal brain function.

Tahiliani et al. (2007) showed that JARID1C/SMCX, a JmjC
domain-containing protein implicated in X-linked mental retardation and
epilepsy, possesses H3K4 tridemethylase activity and functions as a
transcriptional repressor. An SMCX complex isolated from HeLa cells
contained additional chromatin modifiers (the histone deacetylases HDAC1
(601241) and HDAC2 (605164), and the histone H3K9 methyltransferase G9a
(604599)) and the transcriptional repressor REST (600571), suggesting a
direct role for SMCX in chromatin dynamics and REST-mediated repression.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that SMCX and REST co-occupy the
neuron-restrictive silencing elements in the promoters of a subset of
REST target genes. RNA interference-mediated depletion of SMCX
derepressed several of these targets and simultaneously increased H3K4
trimethylation at the sodium channel type 2A (SCN2A; 182390) and
synapsin I (SYN1; 313440) promoters. Tahiliani et al. (2007) proposed
that loss of SMCX activity impairs REST-mediated neuronal gene
regulation, thereby contributing to SMCX-associated X-linked mental
retardation.

Using a genomewide small interfering RNA screen and secondary screens,
Smith et al. (2010) identified 96 cellular genes that contributed to
viral E2 protein-mediated repression of the human papillomavirus (HPV)
long control region, which controls viral oncogene expression. In
addition to the E2-binding protein BRD4 (608749), other genes implicated
included the demethylase SMCX and EP400 (606265), a component of the
NUA4/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase complex (see 601409). Smith et al.
(2010) concluded that HPV E2 uses multiple cellular proteins to inhibit
expression of its oncogenes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jensen et al. (2005) stated that the SMCX gene comprises 26 exons.

MAPPING

By Southern hybridization analysis of a panel of human/mouse somatic
cell hybrids containing various portions of translocated human X
chromosomes, Wu et al. (1994) assigned the XE169 gene to the proximal
half of the short arm of the X chromosome between Xp21.1 and the
centromere.

Wu et al. (1994) assigned Xe169 to band F2/F3 on the mouse X chromosome
by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and Southern analysis indicated
that the gene is located outside the pseudoautosomal region.

Using direct in situ hybridization, Agulnik et al. (1994) mapped the
mouse Smcx gene to the distal end of the X chromosome (XF2-XF4) and its
human homolog, SMCX, to proximal Xp (Xp11.2-p11.1). Meiotic mapping in
the mouse placed Smcx in the interval between Plp and Pdha1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a systematic screen of brain-expressed genes from the proximal Xp and
pericentromeric regions of the X chromosome in 210 families with
X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), Jensen et al. (2005) identified
mutations in the JARID1C gene in affected members of 7 families with
MRXSCJ (300534), including 1 frameshift and 2 nonsense mutations, as
well as 4 missense mutations that altered evolutionarily conserved amino
acids. In 2 of these families, expression studies revealed the almost
complete absence of the mutated JARID1C transcript, suggesting that the
phenotype in these families resulted from functional loss of the JARID1C
protein. The JARID1C gene, formerly known as SMCX, is highly similar to
the Y chromosome gene that encodes the H-Y antigen variously known as
JARID1D, SMCY, and HYA (426000). Jensen et al. (2005) noted that in
families with nonsyndromic XLMR, more than 30% of mutations seem to
cluster on the proximal part of the short arm of the X chromosome and in
the pericentric region. The authors estimated that the frequency of
mutations in the JARID1C gene account for 2.8% to 3.3% families with
XLMR.

In 4 of 287 probands with X-linked mental retardation, Abidi et al.
(2008) identified 4 different mutations in the JARID1C gene (see, e.g.,
314690.0007).

Poeta et al. (2013) found that ARX (300382) bound to conserved noncoding
elements in the 5-prime region of the KDM5C gene, resulting in increased
expression of KDM5C. In vitro cellular expression studies showed that
transfection of 5 ARX mutants (see, e.g., 300382.0022) that cause
intellectual disability or severe epilepsy resulted in variably
decreased activation of the KDM5C gene compared to wildtype ARX. The
changes in polyA repeats caused hypomorphic ARX alterations, which
exhibit a decreased transactivity and reduced, but not abolished,
binding to the KDM5C regulatory region. The altered functioning of the
mutants tested correlated with the severity of the associated phenotype.
Quantitative RT-PCR studies showed a dramatic decrease of Kdm5c mRNA in
murine Arx-null embryonic and neural stem cells. The decrease in the
KDM5C content during in vitro neuronal differentiation inversely
correlated with increased histone regulation, as measured by H3K4me3
levels. The findings linked ARX polyA expansions to KDM5C, mutations of
which cause a similar phenotype, and established that ARX polyA
alterations damage the regulation of KDM5C expression, suggesting a
pathogenic pathway involving changes in chromatin remodeling in these
neurologic disorders.

OTHER FEATURES

Agulnik et al. (1994) isolated a mouse Y chromosome gene from the region
encoding Spy, a spermatogenesis gene, and Hya and Sdma, the genes that,
respectively, control the expression of the male specific minor
histocompatibility antigen H-Y, as measured by specific T-cell assays,
and the serologically detected male antigen SDMA. See 426000 for a
discussion of SMCY (so named for 'selected mouse cDNA on Y') and its
human homolog. The murine gene maps to Yp; the human homolog, SMCY, maps
to Yq.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, LEU731PHE

In affected members of a family with syndromic X-linked mental
retardation (300534) originally reported by Claes et al. (2000), Jensen
et al. (2005) detected a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2191 in exon 16
of the JARID1C gene that changed leucine to phenylalanine at codon 731
(L731F). Jensen et al. (2005) suggested that the L731F mutation, which
is located in an evolutionarily conserved C5HC2 zinc finger domain, may
have a profound effect on that domain as a result of the difference in
size and chemical properties between leucine and phenylalanine.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, 1-BP INS, 202C

In 2 brothers with a severe form of mental retardation (300534), Jensen
et al. (2005) identified a single-nucleotide insertion of a cytidine
(202_203insC) in exon 2 of the JARID1C gene that introduced a frameshift
with premature stop codon at codon 75 (R68fsX7). The change was not
found in 312 control X chromosomes. The authors suggested that the
mutation, which did not seem to undergo nonsense-mediated decay (NMD),
may cause the aberrant phenotype through either extreme shortening of
the protein and deletion of relevant domains, or through production of
an abnormal protein by alternative use of a methionine downstream of
exon 2. With an almost identical phenotype, both brothers had had
removal of the gallbladder because of gallstones, at ages 20 and 31
years, respectively.

.0003
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, ALA388PRO

In a family with 4 males who presented with mental retardation and
microcephaly (300534), Jensen et al. (2005) observed an 1162G-to-C
transversion in exon 9 of the JARID1C gene that caused an ala388-to-pro
(A388P) amino acid substitution.

.0004
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, ARG694TER

In 2 brothers with X-linked mental retardation and short stature
(300534), Jensen et al. (2005) found a 2080C-to-T transition in exon 15
of the JARID1C gene that caused a premature termination at arg694
(R694X). KDM5C mRNA expression was almost undetectable, indicating
nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).

.0005
MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, SER451ARG

In 2 male sibs with X-linked mental retardation (300534), Santos et al.
(2006) identified a 1353C-G transversion in exon 10 of the JARID1C gene,
resulting in a ser451-to-arg (S451R) substitution. The unaffected mother
was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not identified in 250
control chromosomes.

KDM5C, ARG766TRP

In a 4-year-old boy with cognitive impairment (300534), Adegbola et al.
(2008) identified a hemizygous 2296C-T transition in exon 16 of the
JARID1C gene, resulting in an arg766-to-trp (R766W) substitution. His
unaffected mother also carried the mutation. Detailed neuropsychologic
testing of the patient showed significant delays in perception, fine
motor skills, cognitive and language skills, and difficulty with
self-regulation. He also showed impairments in social reciprocity and
use of nonverbal behavior, stereotyped mannerisms, and adherence to
routine, consistent with autistic spectrum disorder. Although he had no
dysmorphic features as observed in many patients with KDM5C-related
mental retardation, Adegbola et al. (2008) noted that the phenotype
associated with mutations in the KDM5C gene is variable with regard to
dysmorphism and cognitive impairment; the authors suggested that this
patient falls within a milder end of the spectrum.

MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, ALA77THR

In affected members of a family with X-linked mental retardation
(300534), Abidi et al. (2008) identified a 229G-A transition in exon 3
of the JARID1C gene, resulting in an ala77-to-thr (A77T) substitution in
the ARID/BRIGHT domain. Additional features included short stature,
deep-set eyes, prominent nasal bridge, prominent ears, clubfeet, and
aggressive behavior. Three carrier females had mild mental retardation.
The mutation was not identified in 782 control X chromosomes.

MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, CYS724TER

In affected members of a Brazilian family with X-linked mental
retardation (300534), Santos-Reboucas et al. (2011) identified a 2172C-A
transversion in exon 15 of the KDM5C gene, resulting in a cys724-to-ter
(C724X) substitution in the C5HC2 zinc finger domain, resulting in
decreased protein expression likely from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.
There were 3 affected brothers with severe mental retardation, poor
speech, short stature, low weight, microcephaly, high palate, slight
maxillary hypoplasia, and small feet. Their mother, who also carried the
mutation, was mildly cognitively impaired.

MENTAL RETARDATION, X-LINKED, SYNDROMIC, CLAES-JENSEN TYPE
KDM5C, PRO554THR

In affected members of a family with X-linked mental retardation
(300534), Rujirabanjerd et al. (2010) identified a 1160C-A transversion
in exon 12 of the KDM5C gene, resulting in a pro554-to-thr (P554T)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the core of the JmjC
domain. Although the family had previously been designated as
nonsyndromic MRX13 (Kerr et al., 1992), Rujirabanjerd et al. (2010)
noted that affected individuals had short stature, large ears, and
microcephaly in addition to moderate intellectual disability. Two of 6
female carriers had learning difficulties. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein had significantly
decreased demethylase activity compared to wildtype. In an erratum, the
authors confirmed that the mutation was P554T; the mutation was
incorrectly stated as P544T in the abstract and text of their article.

600572	TITLE *600572 SPLICING FACTOR, SERINE/ARGININE-RICH, 7; SRSF7
;;SERINE/ARGININE-RICH SPLICING FACTOR 7;;
SPLICING FACTOR, ARGININE/SERINE-RICH, 7; SFRS7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cavaloc et al. (1994) used a monoclonal antibody to identify a splicing
factor of 35 kD which they named 9G8. Based on partial sequence of
tryptic peptides, the authors designed degenerate PCR primers and
obtained a PCR product which was used to probe genomic and cDNA
libraries. The isolation and characterization of cDNA clones indicated
that the 9G8 protein (gene symbol, SFRS7) is a member of the
serine/arginine (SR) splicing factor family because it includes an
N-terminal RNA binding domain and a C-terminal SR domain. Members of
this family are thought to play key roles in alternative splicing. The
RNA binding domain of 9G8 is closely related (79 to 71% identity) to
those of the SR factors human SRp20 (603364) and Drosophila RBP1.
Immunodepletion of the 9G8 protein from a nuclear extract resulted in
the loss of splicing activity. In turn, in vitro-expressed recombinant
9G8 protein rescued the splicing activity of a 9G8-depleted nuclear
extract.

GENE STRUCTURE

Popielarz et al. (1995) isolated and characterized the human 9G8 gene.
The gene spans 7,745 bp and consists of 8 exons and 7 introns within the
coding sequence, thus contrasting with the organization of some other
genes of the SR splicing factor family. The 5-prime flanking region is
GC-rich and contains basal promoter sequences and potential regulatory
elements. They presented results raising the possibility that
alternative splicing of intron 3 provides a mechanism for modulation of
the 9G8 function.

GENE FUNCTION

Lareau et al. (2007) reported that in every member of the human SR
family of splicing regulators, highly or ultraconserved elements are
alternatively spliced, either as alternative 'poison cassette exons'
containing early in-frame stop codons, or as alternative introns in the
3-prime untranslated region. These alternative splicing events target
the resulting mRNAs for degradation by means of an RNA surveillance
pathway called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Mouse orthologs of the
human SR proteins exhibit the same unproductive splicing patterns. Three
SR proteins, SRp20 (603364), SC35 (600813), and 9G8 (SFRS7), had been
previously shown to direct splicing of their own transcripts, and SC35
autoregulates its expression by coupling alternative splicing with
decay. Lareau et al. (2007) concluded that unproductive splicing is
important for regulation of the entire SR family and found that
unproductive splicing associated with conserved regions has arisen
independently in different SR genes, suggesting that splicing factors
may readily acquire this form of regulation.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Popielarz et al. (1995) localized the
SFRS7 gene to 2p22-p21.

606575	TITLE *606575 MEMBRANE PROTEIN, PALMITOYLATED 4; MPP4
;;DISCS LARGE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 6; DLG6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By expression profiling of retina-specific ESTs and RT-PCR of retinal
RNA, Stohr and Weber (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding MPP4. The predicted
637-amino acid MPP4 protein, which is 36% identical to MPP3 (601114) and
75% identical to its rat homolog, contains an N-terminal PDZ domain, a
central SH3 motif, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase (GUK)-like domain
typical of MAGUK (membrane-associated GUK) proteins. Northern blot and
RT-PCR analyses detected a 3.8-kb transcript expressed only in retina.
Stohr and Weber (2001) noted that tissue-restricted expression of a
MAGUK protein had not been reported previously.

By immunofluorescence analysis of mouse retina, Yang et al. (2007)
showed that Mpp4 localized to the synaptic layer of photoreceptors.
Immunoelectron microscopy showed that Mpp4 distributed primarily along
the plasma membrane of photoreceptor synaptic terminals.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Stohr and Weber (2001) determined that the
MPP4 gene contains 22 exons and spans at least 50 kb.

MAPPING

By BAC and sequence database analysis, Stohr and Weber (2001) mapped the
MPP4 gene to chromosome 2q31. They proposed that MPP4 represents a
candidate gene for retinal disease due to its colocalization with RP26,
a locus for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (Bayes et al.,
1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Aartsen et al. (2006) found that Mpp4 -/- mice were indistinguishable
from wildtype littermates and that they grew and bred normally. However,
histologic examination revealed sporadic photoreceptor displacement.
Light and electron microscopy of Mpp4 -/- retinas revealed no structural
differences at the outer limiting membrane or photoreceptor synapse.
Electroretinography revealed overtly normal retinal activity, and
scanning laser ophthalmology showed apparently normal overall structure
in Mpp4 -/- retinas. Mpp4 -/- retinas showed downregulation of Psd95
(DLG4; 602887) and mislocalization of both Psd95 and Veli3 (LIN7C;
612332) at the photoreceptor presynaptic membrane. Aartsen et al. (2006)
proposed that MPP4 may function as a recruitment factor to organize
signal transducers at the photoreceptor synapse.

Yang et al. (2007) found that Mpp4 -/- mice were viable, fertile, and
apparently healthy. However, Mpp4 -/- retinas showed abnormal
sensitivity to light flash. Histologic examination revealed that the
size, shape, and density of rod terminals and synaptic vesicles were
normal, but the height of synaptic ribbons was increased in Mpp4 -/-
mice under both dark- and light-adapted conditions, suggesting elevated
Ca(2+) concentrations. Western blot analysis showed reduced expression
of the rhodopsin (RHO; 180380)-deactivating proteins, rhodopsin kinase
(GRK1; 180381) and recoverin (RCV1; 179618). Mpp4 -/- retina also showed
increased expression of Serca2 (ATP2A2; 108740) and abnormal
localization of type-2 inositol trisphosphate receptor (ITPR2; 600144),
confirming altered Ca(2+) homeostasis. The retinal content of plasma
membrane Ca(2+) ATPases (PMCAs; see 108731) was unchanged, but
immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the localization of PMCAs at
the rod presynaptic plasma membrane was lost. Yang et al. (2007)
concluded that MPP4 has a role in the membrane localization of PMCAs and
in modulating Ca(2+) homeostasis and synaptic transmission in rod
photoreceptors.

137240	TITLE *137240 GASTRIC INHIBITORY POLYPEPTIDE; GIP
;;GLUCOSE-DEPENDENT INSULINOTROPIC POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gastric inhibitory polypeptide, also known as glucose-dependent
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), is a 42-amino acid hormone that
stimulates insulin (INS; 176730) secretion in the presence of glucose.
Its sequence indicates that it is a member of a family of structurally
related hormones that includes secretin (182099), glucagon (138030),
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; 192320), and growth
hormone-releasing factor (GHRH; 139190) (summary by Takeda et al.,
1987).

CLONING

Takeda et al. (1987) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding the
human GIP precursor from a human duodenal cDNA library. The predicted
amino acid sequence of the precursor indicates that GIP is derived by
proteolytic processing of a 153-residue precursor, preproGIP, which has
a predicted molecular mass of 17.1 kD. The GIP moiety is flanked by
polypeptide segments of 51 and 60 amino acids at its amino and carboxyl
termini, respectively. GIP is released from the precursor by processing
at single arginine residues present at each end of the GIP sequence.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs and by in situ
hybridization using a GIP cDNA, Fukushima et al. (1989) and Inagaki et
al. (1989) mapped the human GIP gene to chromosome 17q21.3-q22.

By genetic linkage studies using multiple DNA markers from the 17q12-q21
region, Anderson et al. (1993) placed GIP on the genetic map of the
region in a position distal to HOX2B (142961) and GP3A (173470). By
genetic mapping through CEPH reference families and by high-resolution
radiation hybrid mapping, Lewis et al. (1994) concluded that the GIP
gene is in a tight cluster in the following order:
cen--PPY--HOXB6--NGFR--GIP--NME1--tel. GIP was estimated to lie 250 kb
distal to NGFR (162010).

Mohlke et al. (1996) demonstrated that the Gip gene is located in the
distal portion of mouse chromosome 11, closely linked to Mvwf (see
111730) and between Ngfr and Hoxb9.

GENE FUNCTION

Cheung et al. (2000) found that gut K cells could be induced to produce
human insulin by providing the cells with the human INS gene linked to
the 5-prime regulatory region of the GIP gene. Mice expressing this
transgene produced human insulin specifically in gut K cells. This
insulin protected the mice from developing diabetes (see 222100) and
maintained glucose tolerance after destruction of the native
insulin-producing beta cells.

609948	TITLE *609948 RING FINGER PROTEIN 216; RNF216
;;TRIAD DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; TRIAD3;;
ZINC FINGER PROTEIN INHIBITING NFKB; ZIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIAD proteins, such as TRIAD3, contain 2 RING fingers flanking a
conserved cysteine-rich (C6HC) zinc-binding domain called a double RING
finger-linked (DRIL) domain. Like other RING finger proteins, TRIADs
interact with a variety of proteins (van der Reijden et al., 1999).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a B-cell cDNA library using RIP (RIPK1;
603453) as bait, followed by database searching and 5-prime RACE, Chen
et al. (2002) cloned TRIAD3, which they called ZIN. The predicted
488-amino acid protein contains 4 central RING-like domains (RLDs) and a
C-terminal proline-rich domain. Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of 3.0- and 6.0-kb transcripts, with highest
levels in peripheral blood leukocytes and testis. Western blot analysis
showed a 56-kD protein in several human cell lines. Immunofluorescence
microscopy suggested a cytoplasmic localization for ZIN, like that of
RIP.

By yeast-2 hybrid screening of a human leukocyte cDNA library using the
cytoplasmic TIR domain of TLR9 (605474) as bait, followed by database
analysis and screening a placenta cDNA library, Chuang and Ulevitch
(2004) cloned 5 splice variants of TRIAD3 that they designated TRIAD3A
to TRIAD3E. TRIAD3A and TRIAD3B encode predicted proteins of 866 and 923
amino acids, respectively. TRIAD3C, TRIAD3D, and TRIAD3E encode
identical proteins of 489 amino acids. All TRIAD3 isoforms contain a
C-terminal TRIAD domain and differ in their N-terminal halves. RT-PCR
analysis showed that TRIAD3A was the most abundant form and was
expressed widely in cell lines and tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chuang and Ulevitch (2004) determined that the TRIAD3 gene contains 17
exons and spans about 160 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chuang and Ulevitch (2004) mapped the
RNF216 gene to chromosome 7p22.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation experiments and mutation analysis, Chen et
al. (2002) found that interaction of ZIN and RIP required the RLDs of
ZIN. Luciferase and Western blot analysis showed that ZIN inhibited
RIP-, IKKB (IKBKB; 603258)-, TNF (191160)-, and IL1 (see 147720)-induced
NFKB (see 164011) activation in an RLD-dependent manner. ZIN also
potentiated RIP-induced apoptosis. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments
showed that ZIN did not compete with TRAF2 (601895) for interaction with
RIP.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Chuang and Ulevitch (2004) found that
TRIAD3 interacted with the cytoplasmic domains of TLR3 (603029), TLR4
(603030), TLR5 (603031), and TLR9, but not with that of TLR2 (603028).
Immunoblot analysis showed that expression of TRIAD3A with ubiquitin
(see 191339) resulted in TRIAD3A autoubiquitination and promoted
ubiquitination of TLR9 by acting through UBCH7 (UBE2L3; 603721). TRIAD3A
overexpression caused nearly complete degradation of TLR4 and TLR9
protein, but not TLR2 protein, while its effects on TLR3 and TLR5 were
smaller. The TRIAD3A-induced reduction in TLR protein expression was
paralleled by reductions in signal-specific activation for TLRs, as
shown by RT-PCR and small interfering RNA analyses. Chuang and Ulevitch
(2004) concluded that TRIAD3A is an intracellular protein that regulates
TLR expression and limits the potentially harmful effects that occur
after TLR activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 7-generation consanguineous Palestinian family with cerebellar
ataxia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CAHH; 212840), Margolin et al.
(2013) performed exome sequencing and identified homozygosity for 2
missense mutations in 2 different genes, RNF216 (R751C; 609948.0001) and
OTUD4 (G333V; 611744.0001), that segregated with disease in the family.
Sequencing both genes in 9 more patients revealed no further mutations
in the OTUD4 gene, although 1 proband was compound heterozygous for
mutations in RNF216 (609948.0002 and 609948.0003). In addition, several
patients carried heterozygous mutations in RNF216 that were also
detected in unaffected parents and sibs. Margolin et al. (2013)
suggested that the most parsimonious explanation for the observed
patterns in these patients would be oligogenic inheritance.

ANIMAL MODEL

Margolin et al. (2013) injected splice-blocking morpholino
oligonucleotides against the zebrafish genes rnf216 or odud4 (611744)
and observed defects in the eye, optic tetum, and cerebellum.
Combinatorial suppression of both genes exacerbated these phenotypes,
which were rescued by wildtype but not mutant human RNF216 or OTUD4
messenger RNA.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CEREBELLAR ATAXIA AND HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM
RNF216, ARG751CYS

In 3 affected sibs from a 7-generation consanguineous Palestinian family
with cerebellar ataxia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CAHH; 212840),
originally reported by Seminara et al. (2002), Margolin et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for 2 missense mutations in 2 genes: a c.2251C-T
transition in the RNF216 gene, resulting in an arg751-to-cys (R751C)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the second RING domain,
and a missense mutation in the OTUD4 gene (G333V; 611744.0001). The
mutations segregated with disease in the family and neither was found in
672 Middle Eastern control chromosomes, including 36 Palestinian
chromosomes; furthermore, the RNF216 R751C mutation was not found in
13,006 chromosomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, although the
OTUD4 G333V variant was detected in 2 of those chromosomes. The
phenotype of mutant zebrafish injected with splice-blocking morpholino
oligonucleotides against rnf216 could be rescued by wildtype but not
mutant RNF216 mRNA, suggesting that the R751C mutation affects protein
function. The 3 sibs had prominent cerebellar and mild cortical atrophy
with hypodensities in the cerebral white matter on CT scan, and all died
in the fifth decade of life after the development of dementia, 2 from
aspiration pneumonia and 1 from possible pulmonary embolism.
Neuropathologic examination of the brain of 1 sib revealed neuronal loss
in cerebellar pathways and the hippocampus; surviving hippocampal
neurons contained ubiquitin-immunoreactive intranuclear inclusions.

CEREBELLAR ATAXIA AND HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM
RNF216, CYS597TER

In a Caucasian man with cerebellar ataxia and hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (212840), who developed dementia at 22 years of age and
died at age 36, Margolin et al. (2013) identified compound
heterozygosity for a c.1791T-A transversion in the RNF216 gene,
resulting in a cys597-to-ter (C597X) substitution in the first RING
finger domain, and a 2-bp deletion (c.615_616delGA; 609948.0003),
causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination
codon (glu505aspfsX15). The patient's unaffected parents were each
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was found in
13,006 chromosomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project.

611730	TITLE *611730 ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN BAND 4.1-LIKE 5; EPB41L5
;;KIAA1548
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned EPB41L5, which they designated
KIAA1548. RT-PCR ELISA detected expression in all tissues tested, with
highest expression in kidney, ovary, and brain.

Jensen and Westerfield (2004) identified human EPB41L5 as the homolog of
the zebrafish 'mosaic eyes' (moe) gene. The deduced EPB41L5 and moe
proteins share 61% overall sequence identity and 87% identity in the N
terminus. Both proteins contain a conserved FERM domain present in
members of the EPB41 (130500) family of cytoskeletal proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Jensen et al. (2001) showed that the zebrafish moe gene is expressed in
the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and that mutations in the gene
produce retinal lamination defects. Jensen and Westerfield (2004) found
that mutant fish also show defects in the kidney and brain, including
edema and small or absent brain ventricles. Jensen and Westerfield
(2004) proposed that moe is required for tight junction formation in the
RPE and is part of the pathway that controls apical cell polarity in
photoreceptor morphogenesis as well as in other epithelial-derived
tissues.

Using an antibody to the mouse Epb41l5 protein, Gosens et al. (2007)
showed that at early embryonic stages the protein localizes to the
basolateral membrane compartment, whereas in adult tissues it is found
at the apical domain along with Crumbs proteins (Crb1, 604210; Crb2,
609720; Crb3, 609737) and Mpp5 (606958). Overexpression of Epb41l5
affected tightness of cell junctions and resulted in disorganization of
the tight junction markers ZO1 (601009) and PATJ (603199). Gosens et al.
(2007) showed that Epb41L5 binds to conserved motifs in Crb1, Crb2,
Crb3, and Mpp5, and is a component of the Crumbs polarity complex first
identified in Drosophila. They concluded that EPB41L5 is likely to be
important in cell polarity processes in many epithelial-derived tissues
in addition to the retina.

Laprise et al. (2009) reported that the Drosophila FERM proteins Yurt
(Yrt) and Coracle (Cora) and the membrane proteins Neurexin IV (Nrx-IV)
and the sodium-potassium ATPase are a group of functionally cooperating
epithelial polarity proteins. This Yrt/Cora group promotes basolateral
membrane stability and shows negative regulatory interactions with the
apical determinant Crumbs (see 604210). Genetic analyses indicate that
the Nrx-IV and sodium-potassium ATPase act together with Cora in one
pathway whereas Yrt acts in a second redundant pathway. Laprise et al.
(2009) showed that the Yrt/Cora group is essential for epithelial
polarity during organogenesis but not when epithelial polarity is first
established or during terminal differentiation. They also found that the
mammalian Yrt ortholog EPB41L5 (also known as YMO1 and Limulus) is
required for lateral membrane formation, indicating a conserved function
of Yrt proteins in epithelial polarity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the EPB41L5
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH79778).

Jensen and Westerfield (2004) stated that the EPB41L5 gene maps to
chromosome 2q14 and is adjacent to the PTPN4 gene (176878), and that the
moe gene in zebrafish is also adjacent to the Ptpn4 gene. Scott (2008)
noted that these findings indicate that EPB41L5 and moe are true
orthologs.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

SR proteins are required in pre-mRNA splicing. See, for example, 600812,
600813, 600572, 601944, 601945, and 600914. Zahler et al. (1993)
isolated a cDNA encoding a gene they designated human SRp75, which was
later identified as SFRS4. The apparent molecular mass of SRp75 is 75
kD; the phosphorylated SRp75 has a molecular mass of 57 kD. The authors
found that SRp75, like other SR proteins, contains an N-terminal RNA
recognition motif (RRM), a glycine-rich region, an internal region
homologous to the RRM, and a long 315-amino acid C-terminal
serine/arginine-rich domain. Zahler et al. (1993) found that purified
SRp75 protein can complement a splicing-deficient S100 extract.

GENE FUNCTION

Lareau et al. (2007) reported that in every member of the human SR
family of splicing regulators, highly or ultraconserved elements are
alternatively spliced, either as alternative 'poison cassette exons'
containing early in-frame stop codons, or as alternative introns in the
3-prime untranslated region. These alternative splicing events target
the resulting mRNAs for degradation by means of an RNA surveillance
pathway called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Mouse orthologs of the
human SR proteins exhibit the same unproductive splicing patterns.
Lareau et al. (2007) concluded that unproductive splicing is important
for regulation of the entire SR family and found that unproductive
splicing associated with conserved regions has arisen independently in
different SR genes, suggesting that splicing factors may readily acquire
this form of regulation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SFRS4
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-74500).

190450	TITLE *190450 TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE 1; TPI1
;;TPI
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI; EC 5.3.1.1) catalyzes the
interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (summary by Ationu et al., 1999).

CLONING

Electrophoretic variants of triosephosphate isomerase were identified by
the Galton Laboratory group (Hopkinson and Harris, 1971).

Brown et al. (1985) isolated the functional gene and 3 intronless
pseudogenes for human TPI from a recombinant DNA library. The
pseudogenes share a high degree of homology with the functional gene but
contain mutations that preclude synthesis of active TPI enzyme. Sequence
divergence indicated origin of the pseudogenes about 18 million years
ago. Brown et al. (1985) concluded that the human TPI gene family has
only 1 functional gene.

Yuan et al. (1979), on the basis of structural analysis, concluded that
the TPI-A and TPI-B isozymes are products of distinct structural loci.
Decker and Mohrenweiser (1981) presented evidence that triosephosphate
isomerase isozymes are the expression of a single structural locus. (The
existence of 2 TPI loci, both probably coded by chromosome 12, had been
suggested to explain the observed isozyme patterns.) They identified a
rare electrophoretic variant and found that the variant phenotype was
expressed in the TPI-B isozyme of both red cells and circulating
lymphocytes and was also expressed in the TPI-A isozyme of
mitogen-stimulated lymphoblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

TPI is a dimeric enzyme of identical subunits that is characterized by a
high constitutive level of activity in all tissues. It is involved in
both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, catalyzing the interconversion of
DHAP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. TPI is one of the most efficient
enzymes known, enhancing proton transfer by a factor of 10(10), and is
the least rate-limiting step in glycolysis (summary by Watanabe et al.,
1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Brown et al. (1985) found that the functional TPI1 gene spans 3.5 kb and
is split into 7 exons.

MAPPING

From study of 3 patients with different deletions of chromosome 12,
Rethore et al. (1976, 1977) concluded that the GAPD locus (138400) is on
the distal part of 12p, between 12p12.2 and 12pter, and that the LDHB
locus (150100) is on the middle third between 12p12.1 and 12p12.2. The
results for TPI were like those for GAPD, suggesting the same distal
localization.

Law and Kao (1978) summarized data suggesting the order
12pter--TPI--GAPD--SHMT (SHMT2; 138450) on chromosome 12. SHMT lies on
the proximal part of 12q between the centromere and PEPB (169900).

Brown et al. (1985) confirmed that the functional TPI gene is on
chromosome 12 whereas the pseudogenes are on other chromosomes.

Asakawa and Iida (1985) also found support for a single TPI locus. GPI
(172400) and PEPD (613230), which are on chromosome 19 in man, are on
chromosome 9 of the Chinese hamster, and TPI, which is on chromosome 12
of man, is on Chinese hamster chromosome 8 (Siciliano et al., 1983).

OTHER FEATURES

TPI was 1 of 4 representative 'ancient' proteins used by Stoltzfus et
al. (1994) to test the exon theory of genes. Spliceosomal introns are
present in the nuclear protein-coding genes of most eukaryotic
organisms, but they have not been detected in several eukaryotic protist
phyla or in eubacteria, archaebacteria, and organelles. Two major
theories had emerged in the continuing debate on the origin of these
introns. The exon theory of genes (sometimes called the introns-early
view) proposed that exons are the descendants of ancient mini-genes and
introns are the descendants of the spaces between them; genes large
enough to encode contemporary proteins were first assembled from sets of
exons; the machinery of splicing originated in an ancient RNA world; and
introns were lost completely from both kingdoms of bacteria as well as
several protist groups. In contrast, the insertional theory of intron
origin (also known as the introns-late view) holds that split genes
arise from uninterrupted genes by insertion of introns; genes large
enough to encode contemporary proteins first arose (presumably from
smaller genes) without the participation of introns; the machinery of
spliceosomal splicing arose from fragmented self-splicing introns; and
spliceosomal introns were never present in the ancestors of those
organisms that now lack them. The analysis performed by Stoltzfus et al.
(1994) on TPI, the globins, pyruvate kinase, and alcohol dehydrogenase
demonstrated no significant correspondence between exons and units of
protein structure, suggesting that the putative correspondence does not
exist and that the exon theory of genes is untenable.

The chicken-and-egg question of which came first--exons or introns--was
studied, using TPI as a model, also by Kwiatowski et al. (1995) and
Logsdon et al. (1995). Each group looked at the positions of introns in
homologous TPI genes from a number of phylogenetically diverse species.
Both groups concluded that introns were gained comparatively recently in
eukaryotic evolution by insertion into preexisting genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Eber et al. (1979) identified 5 persons heterozygous for a TPI null
allele.

Maquat et al. (1985) concluded that the genetic basis of TPI deficiency
is heterogeneous: normal levels of TPI mRNA were found in 1 homozygote
and about 40% of normal in another. The rare homozygous deficient
persons usually have 3 to 10% of normal enzyme activity.

Daar et al. (1986) and Pekrun et al. (1995) identified homoygosity for a
glu104-to-asp (E104D; 190450.0001) mutation in the TPI1 gene in patients
with triosephosphate deficiency. Arya et al. (1997) found that among 7
unrelated Northern European kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency, the
glu104-to-asp mutation accounted for 11 of 14 (79%) mutant alleles.
Haplotype analysis supported a founder effect.

Studies by Boyer et al. (1989) and Boyer and Maquat (1990) identified
several sequences in the 5-prime region that appear to be required for
maintenance of normal levels of gene expression. These include a CAP
proximal element (CPE) spanning nucleotides -6 and -12. The -5A-G and
-8G-A substitutions identified by Watanabe et al. (1996) are located
within the CPE region. The observation that all 7 affected individuals
shared the same variant CPE allele, an allele that does not exist at
higher frequency in the general African American population, suggested
to the authors a common origin for this TPI-deficiency allele; how the
allele frequency is maintained at such a high level was unclear.

Watanabe et al. (1996) undertook the molecular characterization of the
variant alleles from 7 African American and 3 Caucasian individuals from
the unrelated group identified in the frequency studies. In Caucasians
they found 3 amino acid substitutions, all in residues that are not
directly involved in the enzyme's active site but are highly conserved
through evolutionary time, suggesting important roles for these residues
in maintenance of subunit structure and conformation. One of the amino
acid substitutions, glu104-to-asp (190450.0001), had been previously
identified in cases of hemolytic anemia due to TPI deficiency. The
variant allele in the 7 African American individuals had nucleotide
changes at positions -8 and -5 on the 5-prime side of the
transcription-initiation site.

In a study of 424 African American subjects and 75 white subjects,
Schneider et al. (1998) found that the -5 (592A-G), -8 (382G-A), and -24
(573T-G) variants in the triosephosphate isomerase gene occurred
frequently (41%) in the African American subjects but did not occur in
whites. These data suggested that this set of polymorphisms may be one
of the higher-incidence molecular markers of African lineage. Although
the variant substitutions (occurring in 3 haplotypes: -5 alone, -5 -8,
and -5 -8 -24) were associated with moderate reduction in enzyme
activity, severe deficiency heterozygotes could not be identified with
certainty, and none of the haplotypes was restricted to subjects with
marked reduction of enzyme activity. Three subjects were homozygous for
the -5 -8 haplotype, a finding inconsistent with the putative role of
this haplotype as the cause of a null variant incompatible with life in
homozygotes, as had been suggested in the past for the rarity of
homozygotes with TPI deficiency in African Americans. Despite these
findings, Schneider et al. (1998) admitted the possibility that the -5
-8 or -5 -8 -24 haplotypes may in some instances contribute to compound
heterozygosity and clinical TPI deficiency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gnerer et al. (2006) identified a recessive hypomorphic mutation in
Drosophila, which they called 'wasted away' (wstd), that causes
progressive motor impairment, vacuolar neuropathology, and severely
reduced life span. They found that wstd was caused by a mutation in the
Tpi1 gene. The mutation did not result in a significant deficit in ATP,
and the authors suggested that the lack of TPI1 activity may cause the
accumulation of toxic metabolites upstream of the enzymatic block.

HISTORY

From studies in the cri-du-chat syndrome (123450), Sparkes et al. (1969)
suggested that the TPI locus is on the short arm of chromosome 5. Others
failed to confirm this (Brock and Singer, 1970). Cell hybridization
studies indicated that the TPI locus is on chromosome 12.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, GLU104ASP

In 2 unrelated patients with TPI deficiency (615512), Daar et al. (1986)
found a guanine-to-cytosine transversion in the codon for amino acid
104, resulting in a structurally altered protein in which a glutamate
residue was replaced by an aspartate residue. The importance of
glutamate-104 to enzyme structure and function was indicated by its
conservation in the TPI protein of all species characterized to date.
The glutamate-to-aspartate substitution resulted in a thermolabile
enzyme. The same mutation was identified in an Australian family by
Chang et al. (1993). The alteration of codon 104 was from GAG to GAC.

Pekrun et al. (1995) found this same mutation in a family with severe
TPI deficiency. The 1-year-old index patient suffered from hemolytic
anemia, neuromuscular impairment, and recurrent pneumonia, with the
necessity of intermittent mechanical ventilation. TPI activity in red
cells was reduced to about 20% of normal. Heat stability of the enzyme
was strongly reduced; concentration of the physiologic substrate,
dihydroxyacetone phosphate, was increased 20-fold due to the metabolic
block. During a second pregnancy, examination of a cord blood sample
obtained in the nineteenth gestational week showed that the infant was
homozygous normal. An unaffected, healthy newborn was delivered. The
parents were consanguineous and of Turkish origin.

Arya et al. (1997) found that among 7 unrelated Northern European
kindreds with clinical TPI deficiency, the glu104-to-asp mutation
accounted for 11 (79%) of 14 mutant alleles. In 3 families, molecular
analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for glu104 to asp and novel
missense mutations (see 190450.0004 and 190450.0005). The origin of the
glu104-to-asp mutation was defined by haplotype analysis using a novel
G/A polymorphism at nucleotide 2898 of the TPI gene. Cosegregation of
the low frequency 2898A allele with the G-to-C base change at nucleotide
315, responsible for the glu104-to-asp amino acid substitution,
supported a single origin for that mutation, i.e., founder effect.

.0002
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE MANCHESTER
TPI-MANCHESTER
TPI1, GLY122ARG

In a screening of more than 3,400 persons in an Ann Arbor, Michigan,
population, Perry and Mohrenweiser (1992) found only 1 example of a TPI
electromorph variant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA products and subsequent
direct sequencing identified a G-to-A transition causing a replacement
of gly122 with arg in this electrophoretic mobility variant of TPI which
was referred to as TPI-Manchester. The substitution was at the amino
terminus or solvent interaction end of the fifth beta sheet of the
alpha/beta barrel structure. TPI-Manchester was found to be thermolabile
but the stability of the variant enzyme was not sensitive to other
denaturants.

.0003
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI-HUNGARY
TPI1, PHE240LEU

In a Hungarian family, Chang et al. (1993) found that the proband with
TPI deficiency (615512), who had chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia
but no neuromuscular disabilities, was a genetic compound. One of the
mutations was a missense mutation within codon 240 that changed TTC
(phe) to CTC (leu) and created a thermolabile protein. The substitution
occurred in a phylogenetically conserved amino acid and affected enzyme
activity by disrupting intersubunit contacts or substrate binding, as
deduced from enzyme structural studies. The nature of the other mutation
was not identified (see 190450.0006), but it had the effect of reducing
the abundance of TPI mRNA 10- to 20-fold. The same family was also
reported by Hollan et al. (1993) who gave clinical details on the
13-year-old boy with congenital hemolytic anemia and hyperkinetic
torsion dyskinesia associated with severe TPI deficiency, and on his
brother, a 23-year-old amateur wrestler, who also had congenital
hemolytic anemia but no neurologic symptoms. The latter was the proband
in the study of Chang et al. (1993), which demonstrated compound
heterozygosity. (Hollan et al. (1993) incorrectly referred to the
brothers as being double heterozygotes.) Both had less than 10% TPI
activity and a greatly increased dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) level
in their red blood cells. Their TPI had a slow electrophoretic mobility
and was heat unstable. Both parents and a third brother were healthy
heterozygotes. The older brother represented a unique phenotype since
all published homozygotes had severe neurologic alterations from infancy
or early childhood except 1 infant who died at 11 months, probably too
young for neurologic symptoms to be noted. Furthermore, in contrast to
the 2 affected Hungarian brothers, all but 1 homozygote had died before
the age of 6 years.

.0004
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, CYS41TYR

In 2 families with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (615512), Arya
et al. (1997) found compound heterozygosity for the common glu104-to-asp
mutation (190450.0001) and a previously unknown missense mutation, cys41
to tyr, due to a TGT-to-TAT transition.

.0005
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, ILE170VAL

In a family with triosephosphate isomerase deficiency (615512), Arya et
al. (1997) found that affected individuals showed compound
heterozygosity for the common glu104-to-asp substitution (190450.0001)
and a novel ile170-to-val missense mutation.

.0006
TRIOSEPHOSPHATE ISOMERASE DEFICIENCY
TPI1, GLU145TER

In a Hungarian family with severe TPI deficiency (615512) originally
described by Chang et al. (1993), Orosz et al. (2001) analyzed 2
germline-identical but phenotypically different brothers who were
compound heterozygotes for the F240L mutation (190450.0003) and a
glu145-to-ter (E145X) mutation. The kinetic, thermodynamic, and
associative properties of the recombinant human wildtype and F240L
mutant enzymes were compared with those of TPIs in normal and deficient
erythrocyte hemolysates. The specific activity of the recombinant mutant
enzyme relative to the wildtype was much higher (30%) than expected from
the activity (3%) measured in hemolysates. Comparative studies of the
hemolysate from a British patient with glu104-to-asp (190450.0001)
homozygosity (Ationu et al., 1999) and the platelet lysates from the
Hungarian family suggested that the microcompartmentation of TPI is not
unique for the hemolysates from the Hungarian TPI-deficient brothers.

602225	TITLE *602225 CONE-ROD HOMEOBOX-CONTAINING GENE; CRX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify retinal homeobox-containing genes, Freund et al. (1997)
screened a human retina cDNA library at low stringency with a fragment
from the human CHX10 (142993) cDNA. One of the isolated cDNAs encoded a
novel gene, which the authors termed CRX for 'cone-rod
homeobox-containing gene.' CRX encodes a 299-amino acid protein with a
predicted mass of 32 kD that is most similar to the human OTX1 (600036)
and OTX2 (600037) homeodomain proteins. The CRX homeodomain is located
near the amino terminus at residues 39 to 99 and belongs to the prd
class. Additional domains of the CRX protein include the WSP motif and
the OTX tail. The CRX gene was expressed as an abundant 4.5-kb
transcript in retina but not in any other of 10 tissues or cells
examined.

Furukawa et al. (1997) isolated the mouse Crx gene from mouse retina.
The human CRX cDNA is 97% identical to the mouse gene. Crx expression
was restricted to developing and mature photoreceptor cells. Crx bound
and transactivated the sequence TAATCC/A, which is found upstream of
several photoreceptor-specific genes, including the opsin genes from
many species. Overexpression of Crx using a retroviral vector increased
the frequency of clones containing exclusively rod photoreceptors and
reduced the frequency of clones containing amacrine interneurons and
Muller glial cells. In addition, presumptive photoreceptor cells
expressing a dominant negative form of Crx failed to form proper
photoreceptor outer segments and terminals. The authors concluded that
Crx is a photoreceptor-specific transcription factor and plays a crucial
role in the differentiation of photoreceptor cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Akagi et al. (2004) reported that CRX and OTX2 effectively induced the
generation of photoreceptor-specific phenotypes from ciliary- and
iris-derived cells of adult rat. More than 90% of the CRX- and
OTX2-transfected ciliary- and iris-derived cells exhibited rod opsin
immunoreactivity, whereas few of the similarly transfected
mesencephalon-derived neural stem cells from embryonic rat expressed rod
opsin. At least 2 additional key components of the phototransduction
cascade, recoverin (179618) and G-delta-T1, were expressed by CRX- and
OTX2-transfected iris-derived cells. Akagi et al. (2004) concluded that
CRX and OTX2 induced phenotype generation in cells derived from iris or
ciliary tissue, which may suggest an approach to photoreceptor cell
preparation for retinal transplantation.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7; 164500) is an inherited
neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract
in the ataxin-7 (ATXN7; 607640) protein. A unique feature of SCA7 is
degeneration of photoreceptor cells in the retina, resulting in cone-rod
dystrophy. In an SCA7 transgenic mouse model, La Spada et al. (2001)
found that the cone-rod dystrophy involved altered photoreceptor gene
expression due to interference with CRX. By coimmunoprecipitation
analysis of CRX and ATXN7 truncation and point mutants, Chen et al.
(2004) determined that the ATXN7-interacting domain of CRX localized to
its glutamine-rich region and that the CRX-interacting domain of ATXN7
localized to its glutamine tract. Nuclear localization of ataxin-7 was
required to repress Crx transactivation, and the likely nuclear
localization signals were mapped to the C-terminal region of ataxin-7.
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, the authors showed that both Crx
and ataxin-7 occupied the promoter and enhancer regions of Crx-regulated
retinal genes in vivo. Chen et al. (2004) suggested that one mechanism
of SCA7 disease pathogenesis may be transcription dysregulation, and
that CRX transcription interference may be a predominant factor in SCA7
cone-rod dystrophy retinal degeneration.

MAPPING

Using a combination of in situ hybridization, somatic cell hybrid and
radiation hybrid mapping, and yeast artificial chromosome contig
analysis, Freund et al. (1997) mapped the CRX gene to 19q13.3 in the
interval between markers D19S219 and D19S246 in the critical region of
the cone-rod dystrophy-2 locus (CORD2; 120970).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Freund et al. (1997) found a missense and a frameshift mutation in the
CRX gene in 2 pedigrees with CORD2 (120970). The authors showed that the
missense (602225.0001) mutation was not a polymorphic variant and
concluded that mutation in the CRX gene is responsible for the CORD2
phenotype.

Swain et al. (1997) found an arg41-to-trp substitution in the third
residue of the CRX homeodomain in the proband from a family with
autosomal dominant CORD. The sequence change cosegregated with the
disease phenotype and was not detected in 247 normal controls. The data
suggested that mutations in the CRX gene are associated with
photoreceptor degeneration and that the Crx protein is necessary for the
maintenance of normal cone and rod function.

Because CRX is essential for photoreceptor maintenance and because
expression of a dominant-negative CRX allele in developing retina
prevented outer segment biogenesis (Furukawa et al., 1997), Freund et
al. (1998) tested the hypothesis that CRX mutations are responsible for
some cases of the Leber congenital amaurosis phenotype by examining the
CRX gene of 74 Leber congenital amaurosis patients. They identified 2
patients with a de novo deletion mutation (602225.0003-602225.0004,
respectively) as the cause of Leber congenital amaurosis-7 (LCA7;
613829). Their findings indicated that the product of the CRX gene is
essential not only for normal maintenance of the photoreceptor, as
demonstrated by mutations causing autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy
(120970), but also possibly essential for early photoreceptor
development.

CRX is a transcription factor for several retinal genes, including the
opsins and the gene for interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein.
Because loss of CRX function could alter the expression of a number of
other retinal proteins, Sohocki et al. (1998) screened for mutations in
the CRX gene in probands with a range of degenerative retinal diseases.
Of the 294 unrelated individuals screened, they identified 4 CRX
mutations in families with clinical diagnoses of autosomal dominant
cone-rod dystrophy, late-onset dominant retinitis pigmentosa, or
dominant Leber congenital amaurosis (early-onset retinitis pigmentosa),
and they identified 4 additional benign sequence variants.

Rivolta et al. (2001) summarized 18 mutations in the CRX gene associated
with retinal abnormalities. Except for 1 obviously null allele not
definitely associated with a phenotype (a frameshift in codon 9), all
CRX mutations appeared to be completely penetrant and caused disease in
heterozygotes. These dominant alleles fell into 2 categories. In one
group were missense mutations and short, in-frame deletions; in the
second group were frameshift mutations, all of which were in the last
exon. All of these dominant mutations were likely to produce stable mRNA
that is translated. Rivolta et al. (2001) did not detect a correlation
between type of disease and type of mutation. Four of the mutations were
de novo and these were found in isolated cases of Leber congenital
amaurosis. Rivolta et al. (2001) noted that dominant CRX mutations have
not been associated with mental retardation or developmental delay that
has sometimes been found in Leber congenital amaurosis caused by
mutation in other genes.

Chen et al. (2002) used transient transfection and mobility shift assays
to investigate the consequences of 11 known mutations in CRX in vitro.
They demonstrated that the C-terminal region, between amino acids 200
and 284, is essential for CRX-mediated transcriptional activation. Three
homeodomain missense mutations (R41W, 602225.0005; R41Q, 602225.0006;
and R90W, 602225.0007) displayed decreased transactivating activity, and
E80A (602225.0001) demonstrated markedly increased activity. In vitro
protein-DNA binding assays with mutant CRX homeodomain peptides
demonstrated that the alteration was due to reduced DNA binding to CRX
targets. The authors hypothesized that CRX mutations involved in human
photoreceptor degeneration act by impairing CRX-mediated transcriptional
regulation of the photoreceptor genes. However, since a clear
relationship between the magnitude of biochemical abnormality and degree
of disease severity was not observed, the authors suggested that other
genetic and environmental modifiers may also contribute to the disease
phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

CRX is expressed not only in the photoreceptors of the retina, but also
in the pinealocytes of the pineal gland. Furukawa et al. (1999)
generated mice carrying a targeted disruption of Crx. Homozygous
deficient mice did not elaborate photoreceptor outer segments and lacked
rod and cone activity as assayed by electroretinogram. Expression of
several photoreceptor- and pineal-specific genes was reduced in Crx
mutants. Circadian entrainment was also affected in Crx -/- mice. To
examine photoentrainment activity in homozygous deficient mice, Furukawa
et al. (1999) recorded the activity of wildtype and Crx -/- mice running
on an exercise wheel. All mice showed robust 24-hour rhythms in activity
during entrainment and in constant darkness. All mice showed the most
activity during the dark interval of a 24-hour period. The percentage of
total activity that occurred at night, however, was significantly less
in homozygous deficient mice than in wildtype mice. All mice
re-entrained to the light-dark cycle following an advance of 4 hours in
the cycle; however, the number of days required to complete the shift
was greater in Crx -/- mice.

Zebrafish proved a useful model for studying circadian gene regulation
and pineal organ function. The Crx gene was thought to regulate pineal
circadian activity. In the mouse, targeted inactivation of Crx caused a
reduction in pineal gene expression and attenuated entrainment to
light/dark cycles (Furukawa et al., 1999). Gamse et al. (2002) showed
that Crx and Otx5 (orthodenticle homeobox-5) orthologs are expressed in
both the pineal organ and the asymmetrically positioned parapineal of
larval zebrafish. Circadian gene expression was unaffected by a
reduction in Crx expression but was inhibited specifically by depletion
of Otx5. These results indicate that Otx5 rather than Crx regulates
genes that show circadian expression in the zebrafish pineal complex.

Using expression studies in transgenic mice under conditional Otx2
(600037) gene ablation, Nishida et al. (2003) presented evidence that
Otx2 is a direct upstream regulator of Crx and acts via binding to
specific consensus sequences in the Crx promoter.

Menotti-Raymond et al. (2010) identified a putative mutation in the CRX
gene (546delC) as the cause of autosomal dominant rod-cone dysplasia
(Rdy) in a pedigree of cats segregating for the disorder. Disease
expression in Rdy cats is comparable to that in young patients with
Leber congenital amaurosis or retinitis pigmentosa.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 2
CRX, GLU80ALA

In a Greek family with autosomal dominant CORD2 (120970), Freund et al.
(1997) identified a GAG-to-GCG mutation at codon 80 of one allele of the
CRX gene. The mutation was not a common polymorphism in the Greek
population since it was not found in more than 100 normal Greek alleles
or in more than 600 other Caucasian control alleles examined. The
glu80-to-ala mutation is located within the CRX homeodomain.

.0002
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 2
CRX, 1-BP DEL, 502G

In a northern European family with autosomal dominant CORD2 (120970),
Freund et al. (1997) identified a deletion of G at nucleotide 502 of one
allele of the CRX cDNA (codon 168). This deletion results in a
frameshift and premature termination of the CRX protein.

.0003
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 7
CRX, 2-BP DEL, GLU168

Using SSCP analysis and direct sequencing of PCR-amplified exons of the
CRX gene, Freund et al. (1998) identified putative disease-causing de
novo deletion mutations in CRX in 2 patients with Leber congenital
amaurosis-7 (613829): a 2-bp deletion at the glu168 codon (E168del2bp)
and a 1-bp deletion at the gly217 codon (G217del1bp; 602225.0004). Both
deletions caused frameshifts, and the predicted proteins lacked the
conserved carboxy-terminal tail. The E168del2bp allele had lost an AG
dinucleotide from the GAG codon for the eleventh residue within the
conserved 13-amino acid WSP motif. If the mRNA containing this premature
stop codon were stable, 45% of the protein would be lost and replaced
with a new C terminus of 4 amino acids (VPFA). The G217del1bp allele was
due to deletion of a G nucleotide, also within a short conserved
sequence, and the predicted protein would lack 25% of the C terminus,
with 1 new amino acid (alanine) encoded after the frameshift. Curiously,
the E168del2bp mutation occurred within the same codon as a mutation
found in an autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy family (602225.0003).
Both E168 and G217 are followed by polypyrimidine runs, a feature
commonly associated with deletions. Neither mutation was present in any
of the parents or in 360 control CRX alleles. Freund et al. (1998)
stated that although they were unable to identify a mutation in the
other CRX allele of either patient, both might nevertheless carry a
second CRX mutation (such as a promoter or mid-intron mutation) that
remains to be discovered. If that is the case, the inheritance would be
recessive.

.0005
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 2
CRX, ARG41TRP

In the proband from a family with autosomal dominant CORD2 (120970),
Swain et al. (1997) found an arg41-to-trp substitution in the third
residue of the CRX homeodomain. The substitution caused a decrease in
DNA binding activity. The sequence change cosegregated with the disease
phenotype and was not detected in 247 normal controls.

.0006
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 2
CRX, ARG41GLN

In the proband from a family segregating autosomal dominant cone-rod
dystrophy-2 (120970), Swain et al. (1997) identified a G-to-A transition
in the CRX gene, resulting in an arg41-to-gln (R41Q) substitution. This
mutation involves the same codon as the arg41-to-trp mutation
(602225.0005) found by Swain et al. (1997) in a patient with autosomal
dominant CORD2.

Sohocki et al. (1998) identified the R41Q mutation in a proband
originally diagnosed with late-onset dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The
authors stated that later analysis of additional members of this family
suggested an alternative diagnosis of late-onset, atypical, cone-rod
dystrophy. None of the other 163 probands with a diagnosis of autosomal
dominant RP studied by Sohocki et al. (1998) were found to have a
mutation in the CRX gene.

.0007
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 7
CRX, ARG90TRP

In a patient with Leber congenital amaurosis-7 (613829), Swaroop et al.
(1999) identified a homozygous substitution of arginine (arg) at codon
90 by tryptophan (trp) in the CRX homeodomain due to a C-to-T transition
in exon 3 of the CRX gene. Swaroop et al. (1999) found that the mutant
CRX (R90W) homeodomain demonstrated decreased binding to the previously
identified cis sequence elements in the rhodopsin promoter. In transient
transfection experiments, the mutant protein showed significantly
reduced ability to transactivate the rhodopsin promoter, as well as
lower synergistic activation with the transcription factor NRL (162080).

.0008
LEBER CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS 7
CRX, 1-BP DEL, 520G

Nakamura et al. (2002) reported a novel de novo mutation in the CRX gene
in a Japanese patient with Leber congenital amaurosis-7 (613829). The
CRX gene was analyzed by direct genomic sequencing in the patient with
LCA and in his healthy parents. They identified a heterozygous deletion
of G at nucleotide 520 in CRX, predicting a frameshift in codon 174 and
a premature termination of translation. The mutation was not present in
the proband's unaffected parents. Except for CRX, all known genes that
cause LCA cause the disorder in an autosomal recessive fashion. This
mutation was similar to the other 5 known de novo mutations in CRX
because it was a heterozygous deletion of 1 or 2 base pairs in exon 3
causing a frameshift, producing a protein lacking the conserved OTX tail
motif near the C terminus.

.0009
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 2
CRX, 1-BP DEL, 615C

In a 3-generation Japanese family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD;
120970), Itabashi et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous deletion of a
cytidine at nucleotide 615 in exon 1 of the CRX gene (605delC).
Ophthalmic findings included negative-type electroretinogram and rapid
progression after age 40 years.

.0010
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY 2
CRX, 3-BP DEL/2-BP INS, NT816

In a 2-generation German family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD2; 120970),
Paunescu et al. (2007) identified a novel heterozygous complex mutation
(816delCACinsAA) in the CRX gene, predicting the substitution of 27
C-terminal amino acids by 44 novel amino acids.

D17S811E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

One of the major mediators of the inborn or 'natural' immune system is
the natural killer (NK) cell. Dixon et al. (1993) prepared a subtractive
cDNA library from human NK cells and characterized 13 unique clones. A
clone named B2-1 was highly expressed in both NK and T cells, but was
very weakly expressed or absent in several other cell lines. The deduced
protein was highly homologous to the yeast protein SEC7, which is
located in the Golgi apparatus and is thought to be involved in
transporting proteins through the Golgi complex. B2-1 was the only known
human protein with significant homology to SEC7 and may be one of the
human equivalents of the yeast secretory proteins.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a T-cell leukemia cell line with the
intracellular portion of CD18 (ITGB2; 600065) as bait, Kolanus et al.
(1996) isolated a cDNA encoding cytohesin-1 (PSCD1) and a partial cDNA
encoding PSCD2L (602488), which they designated cts18.1. PSCD1 is 88%
identical to the PSCD2L fragment. The predicted 398-amino acid PSCD1
protein contains a central 200-residue SEC7 domain and a C-terminal
pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Western blot analysis showed expression
of a 47-kD protein, particularly, but not exclusively, in lymphoid
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kolanus et al. (1996) found that overexpression of a full-length PSCD1
protein or of the SEC7 domain only induced CD18-dependent binding to
ICAM1 (147840), whereas the PSCD1 PH domain specifically inhibited
adhesion. Binding analysis indicated that the SEC7 domain, but not the
PH domain, interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of CD18 but not with
other cell surface receptors or protein-tyrosine kinases tested. Kolanus
et al. (1996) concluded that PSCD1 specifically regulates the adhesive
function of beta-2 integrins in lymphocytes.

The induction of a transformed cellular phenotype by viruses requires
the modulation of signaling pathways through viral proteins. Kliche et
al. (2001) showed that the phenotypic changes induced by the kaposin A
protein of human herpesvirus-8 are mediated through its direct
interaction with cytohesin-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)
for ARF GTPases (e.g., ARF1; 103180) and regulator of integrin-mediated
cell adhesion. Focus formation, stress fiber dissolution, and activation
of the ERK1 (601795)/ERK2 (176948) mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signal cascade were reverted by a cytohesin-1 glu157-to-lys
mutant, which is deficient in catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange.
Furthermore, liposome-embedded kaposin A was found to specifically
stimulate cytohesin-1-dependent GTP binding of myristoylated ARF1 in
vitro.

Hafner et al. (2006) used an aptamer displacement screen to identify
SecinH3, a small Sec7 domain-specific molecular antagonist of
cytohesins. The cytohesins are a class of BFA-resistant small GEFs for
ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which regulate cytoskeletal
organization, integrin activation, or integrin signaling. The
application of SecinH3 in human liver cells showed that insulin receptor
complex-associated cytohesins are required for insulin signaling.
SecinH3-treated mice showed increased expression of gluconeogenic genes,
reduced expression of glycolytic, fatty acid, and ketone body metabolism
genes in the liver, reduced liver glycogen stores, and a compensatory
increase in plasma insulin. Thus, Hafner et al. (2006) concluded that
cytohesin inhibition results in hepatic insulin resistance.

Vitale et al. (2000) found that cytohesin-1 interacted with ARF domain
protein-1 (ARD1, or TRIM23; 601747) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
human liver cDNA library. ARD1-GDP interacted well with cytohesin-1 but
poorly with cytohesin-2 (PSCD2; 602488), and cytohesin-1 accelerated
binding of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog to ARD1. Mutation analysis
showed that the effector region of the ARF domain of ARD1 interacted
with the Sec7 domain of cytohesin-1. Physical association between these
domains was highly dependent on experimental conditions, and a free
Mg(2+) concentration that favored nucleotide release from ARD1 and
accumulation of the nucleotide-free ARD1 form also favored interaction
between ARD1 and cytohesin-1. In transfected COS-7 cells, cytohesin-1
was distributed throughout the cell and was also present in the nucleus.
ARD1 associated with vesicular structures concentrated around the
nucleus and scattered throughout the cytoplasm, corresponding to Golgi
and lysosomes, respectively. A constitutively GDP-bound form of ARD1
showed a similar distribution, whereas a constitutively GTP-bound form
of ARD1 was concentrated close to the nucleus in a Golgi-like
distribution only. When ARD1 or its GDP- and GTP-bound forms were
coexpressed with cytohesin-1, only the GDP-bound form showed any change
in distribution or colocalization with cytohesin-1. In 90% of cells
coexpressing the proteins, the GDP-bound form of ARD1 was distributed
throughout the cell, except for the nucleus, and largely colocalized
with cytohesin-1. In less than 10% of cells coexpressing the proteins,
the GDP-bound form of ARD1 and cytohesin-1 colocalized in lysosomes.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Ogasawara et al. (2000) determined that
the PSCD1 gene contains at least 14 exons, including a 3-bp exon 10 also
present in PSCD2 and PSCD3 (605081) but not in PSCD4 (606514) that
results in the insertion of a single glycine into the variable loop
between the first and second beta sheets in the pleckstrin homology
domain.

MAPPING

Dixon et al. (1993) showed by PCR analysis of a human/rodent hybrid
panel that the B2-1 gene is located on chromosome 17. Fluorescence in
situ hybridization localized the gene to 17q25.

ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 588, FORMERLY; ZNF588, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs), which bind nucleic acids, perform many key
functions, the most important of which is regulating transcription. See
ZNF91 (603971) for general information on ZNFs.

CLONING

By PCR-based screening of a human genomic YAC library using degenerate
oligonucleotides corresponding to a consensus sequence of the spacer
region of ZNF91 family members, Bellefroid et al. (1993) identified 23
distinct ZNF91-related genes, including ZNF107. They demonstrated that
members of the ZNF91 family are widely expressed in human tissues, with
the highest expression in T-lymphoid cells.

By sequence analysis of a human aorta-specific cDNA, followed by 5-prime
RACE of human brain cDNA, Li et al. (1999) cloned ZNF107, which they
called ZFD25. The deduced 783-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 90.67 kD and contains 25 C2H2-type zinc fingers.
ZNF107 shares 70% homology with both ZNF91 and ZNF117 (194624). The
5-prime untranslated region contains a KRAB domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 6.2-kb transcript in human brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and pancreas. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in
human aorta, liver, lung, and cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells,
umbilical artery smooth muscle cells, and HepG2 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1999) showed that ZNF107 expression in cultured human
umbilical vein endothelial cells decreased in response to a shift from
20% fetal calf serum to serum-free media. They suggested that ZNF107 may
play a role in serum-dependent cellular processes, such as cell
proliferation and survival.

MAPPING

By FISH, Bellefroid et al. (1993) mapped a YAC clone containing the
ZNF107 gene to 7q11.2.

;;PHOSPHOLIPASE C-RELATED CATALYTICALLY INACTIVE PROTEIN 2; PRIP2;;
KIAA1092
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned PLCL2, which they designated
KIAA1092. The deduced 1,154-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with rat 130-kD inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-binding protein
(PLCL1; 600597). RT-PCR ELISA detected very high expression in adult
brain and much lower expression in fetal brain. High expression was also
detected in adult skeletal muscle, ovary, heart, and liver, with lower
expression in all other adult and fetal tissues examined. Within
specific brain regions, highest expression was detected in amygdala,
cerebellum, and caudate nucleus.

Otsuki et al. (1999) cloned mouse Plcl2 from a myoblast cDNA library.
The deduced 1,128-amino acid protein has an N-terminal pleckstrin (PLEK;
173570) homology (PH) domain and putative phospholipase catalytic
domains X and Y. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected
highest expression in skeletal muscle, with moderate expression in brain
and spleen. Western blot analysis detected Plcl2 at an apparent
molecular mass of 130 kD in skeletal muscle, brain, thymus, kidney, and
liver. Immunohistochemical analysis of C2C12 mouse myoblasts and
transfected COS-7 cells revealed a cytoplasmic punctate pattern of Plcl2
expression, with concentration in the perinuclear area.

GENE FUNCTION

Otsuki et al. (1999) found that mouse Plcl2 lacked phospholipase
catalytic activity. However, the isolated PH domain of Plcl2 bound
strongly to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and
moderately to PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4)P. Plcl2 also bound inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the PLCL2 gene
to chromosome 3. Using FISH, Otsuki et al. (1999) mapped the PLCL2 gene
to chromosome 3p25-p24.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tsutsumi et al. (2011) stated that they had previously found that female
mice lacking both Prip1 and Prip2 (PLCL2; 614276) (Prip -/- mice) were
subfertile, with high plasma gonadotropin and low gonadal steroid
levels. Tsutsumi et al. (2011) found that bone mineral density and
trabecular bone volume were higher in female Prip -/- mice, but much
less so in male Prip -/- mice. The difference in bone density between
Prip -/- and wildtype females became negligible by 12 months of age.
Ovariectomy resulted in no change in bone measures in Prip -/- mice,
suggesting that the effect of Prip deletion was independent of hormonal
imbalance. Histologic analysis revealed abnormal bone formation in Prip
-/- mice, with enlarged osteoclasts containing more than 15 nuclei and
loose, weakened absorbing surfaces between osteoclasts and bone. Prip
-/- bone marrow cells cultured to differentiate into osteoclasts were
less active and showed elevated Bmp (see 112262)-dependent Smad (see
601595) phosphorylation compared with wildtype cells. Tsutsumi et al.
(2011) concluded that PRIP1 and PRIP2 are involved in negative
regulation of bone formation.

603620	TITLE *603620 PC4- AND SFRS1-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; PSIP1
;;TRANSCRIPTIONAL COACTIVATOR p75; p75;;
LENS EPITHELIUM-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR; LEDGF
TRANSCRIPTIONAL COACTIVATOR p52, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transcriptional activation in human cell-free systems containing RNA
polymerase II and general initiation factors requires the action of one
or more additional coactivators. Ge et al. (1998) reported the isolation
of cDNAs encoding 2 novel human transcriptional coactivators (p52 and
p75) that are derived from alternatively spliced products of a single
gene and share a region of 325 residues, but show distinct coactivator
properties.

By immunoscreening a human lens epithelial cell cDNA library with
antibodies from a cataract patient, Singh et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA
encoding a protein that they named 'lens epithelium-derived growth
factor' (LEDGF). They determined that LEDGF is identical to p75, a
coactivator of both transcription and pre-mRNA splicing.

GENE STRUCTURE

Singh et al. (2000) found that the LEDGF gene contains at least 15 exons
and encodes LEDGF mRNA and p52 mRNA. Exons 1 through 15 encode LEDGF
mRNA; exons 1 through 9 and part of intron 9 encode p52.

GENE FUNCTION

Ge et al. (1998) demonstrated strong interactions of both p52 and p75
with the VP16 activation domain and several components of the general
transcriptional machinery. p52 is a potent broad-specificity
coactivator, whereas p75 is less active for most activation domains.

Ge et al. (1998) found that p52 interacts not only with transcriptional
activators and general transcription factors to enhance activated
transcription, but also with the essential splicing factor ASF/SF2 both
in vitro and in vivo to modulate ASF/SF2-mediated pre-mRNA splicing.
Immunofluorescence studies indicated that the majority of endogenous p52
is colocalized with ASF/SF2 in the nucleoplasm of HeLa cells. These
observations suggested that, in addition to functioning as a
transcriptional coactivator, p52 may also act as an adaptor to
coordinate pre-mRNA splicing and transcriptional activation of class II
genes.

Singh et al. (2000) observed that in serum-free medium, LEDGF stimulated
growth of lens epithelial cells, COS-7 cells, skin fibroblasts, and
keratinocytes, and prolonged survival of these cell lines. Antibodies
against LEDGF blocked cell growth and caused cell death. Singh et al.
(2000) concluded that LEDGF, a regulatory factor, might play an
important role in the growth and survival of a wide range of cell types.

Singh et al. (2000) found almost equal amounts of LEDGF/p75 and p52
expressed in lens epithelial cells in culture.

Nakamura et al. (2000) studied the effects of LEDGF on survival of
embryonic chick retinal photoreceptor cells under serum starvation and
heat stress. Immunohistochemistry detected LEDGF expression
predominantly in the nucleus of neuroretinal cells, including
photoreceptor cells. In the presence of LEDGF, photoreceptor cells
showed increased resistance to serum starvation and heat stress and
survived for longer periods. Levels of heat shock protein-90 (see
140571) were elevated in LEDGF-treated cells. Most retinal cells died in
the absence of LEDGF. They authors concluded that LEDGF enhanced
survival of retinal photoreceptor cells under serum starvation and heat
stress.

Machida et al. (2001) found that LEDGF protected photoreceptor structure
and function in both light-damaged and RCS rats (see 604705). However,
LEDGF failed to rescue photoreceptors in a transgenic rat model of human
retinitis pigmentosa (268000) carrying a P23H mutation in rhodopsin
(180380.0001).

Ciuffi et al. (2005) noted that LEDGF binds both chromosomal DNA and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase, suggesting that it might
direct HIV integration by a tethering interaction. They found that
treatment of kidney and T-cell lines with short hairpin RNAs to achieve
a strong knockdown of LEDGF resulted in a reduction of HIV integration
in transcription units (i.e., genes) compared with control cells.
Likewise, genes regulated by LEDGF were preferred integration sites.
Knockdown of LEDGF also resulted in increased HIV integration in
chromosomal regions with higher GC content, possibly due to LEDGF
binding preferentially in AT-rich chromosomal regions. Ciuffi et al.
(2005) proposed that LEDGF becomes enriched on genes by binding
components of the transcriptional apparatus, thereby positioning itself
to target HIV integration to these sites.

Llano et al. (2006) used intensified RNA interference and
dominant-negative protein approaches to show that the cellular
transcriptional coactivator lens epithelium-derived growth factor
LEDGF/p75 is an essential HIV integration cofactor. The mechanism
requires both linkages of a molecular tether that p75 forms between
integrase and chromatin. Fractionally minute levels of endogenous p75
are sufficient to enable integration, showing that cellular factors that
engage HIV after entry may elude identification in less intensive
knockdowns.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Cherepanov et al. (2005) reported the crystal structure of the dimeric
catalytic core domain of HIV-1 integrase complexed to the
integrase-binding domain of LEDGF at 2-angstrom resolution. The
structure elucidated the mode of recognition between the 2 proteins and
revealed a potential target site on the integrase for the design of
small molecule inhibitors to block the interaction.

MAPPING

By FISH, Singh et al. (2000) mapped the LEDGF gene to chromosome 9p22.2.
They noted that the 9p22-p21 region is the site of chromosomal
abnormalities in a variety of malignancies, including leukemia, glioma,
lung cancer, and melanoma.

;;GST1, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; GST1;;
PEPTIDE CHAIN RELEASE FACTOR 3A; ERF3A;;
ETF3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kikuchi et al. (1988) isolated a gene from a yeast genomic library that
could complement a temperature-sensitive mutant of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. The gene, termed GST1, seemed to be essential for the G1- to
S-phase transition in the yeast cell cycle. The gene product appeared to
be a GTP-binding protein of molecular mass 76,565 Da with 38% identity
in amino acid sequence with the alpha subunit of elongation factor-1
(130590). Hoshino et al. (1989) cloned the human equivalent from a cDNA
library.

Hoshino et al. (1998) cloned mouse Gspt1. The deduced 635-amino acid
protein has a unique N terminus and a conserved C-terminal eukaryotic
elongation factor-1-alpha-like domain. The mouse and human Gspt1
proteins share 94% sequence identity. RT-PCR analysis indicated
expression of Gspt1 in all mouse tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Eukaryotic RF1 (ETF1; 600285) and RF3 are involved in translation
termination. In vitro, RF1 catalyzes the release of the polypeptide
chain without any stop codon specificity; the GTP-binding protein RF3
confers GTP dependence to the termination process and stimulates RF1
activity. Le Goff et al. (1997) used tRNA-mediated nonsense suppression
of different stop codons in a CAT reporter gene to analyze the
polypeptide chain release factor activities of recombinant human RF1 and
RF3 proteins overexpressed in human cells. Using a CAT assay, they
measured the competition between the suppressor tRNA and the release
factors when a stop codon was present in the ribosomal A site.
Regardless of which of the 3 stop codons was present in the CAT open
reading frame, the overexpression of RF1 alone markedly decreased
translational read-through by suppressor tRNA. Thus, Le Goff et al.
(1997) concluded that RF1 has intrinsic antisuppressor activity. The
levels of antisuppression when both RF1 and RF3 were overexpressed were
almost the same as those when RF1 was overexpressed alone, suggesting
that RF1-RF3 complex-mediated termination may be controlled by the
expression level of RF1. Overexpression of RF3 alone had an inhibitory
effect on CAT gene expression. CAT mRNA stability studies suggested that
RF3 inhibits gene expression at the transcriptional level. Le Goff et
al. (1997) suggested that RF3 may perform other functions, including the
stimulation of RF1 activity, in vivo.

Hoshino et al. (1998) found that expression of Gspt1 by Swiss 3T3 cells
increased with serum or phorbol ester stimulation. By
coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses, they found
interaction between mouse Gspt1 and human eRF1. Hoshino et al. (1998)
hypothesized that Gspt1, in a binary complex with eRF1, functions as a
polypeptide chain release factor.

Alkalaeva et al. (2006) reconstituted eukaryotic translation initiation,
elongation, and termination processes in vitro on a model mRNA encoding
a tetrapeptide followed by a UAA stop codon using individual 40S and 60S
ribosomal subunits and the complete set of individual initiation,
elongation, and release factors. They found that binding of human ERF1
and ERF3A and GTP to the ribosomal pretermination complex induced a
structural rearrangement characterized by a 2-nucleotide forward shift
of the toeprint attributed to the pretermination complex. Subsequent GTP
hydrolysis was required for rapid hydrolysis of peptidyl tRNA in the
pretermination complex. Cooperativity between ERF1 and ERF3A in ensuring
fast peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis required the ERF3A-binding C-terminal
domain of ERF1.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen and in vitro and in vivo binding assays,
including reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays, Tompkins et al. (2006)
showed that GSPT1 bound the p19(ARF) isoform of CDKN2A (600160), but not
the p16(INK4A) isoform.

MAPPING

By nonradioactive in situ hybridization, Ozawa et al. (1992) mapped the
GSPT1 gene, the human homolog of the yeast gene GST1, to human
chromosome 16p13.1. Southern blot hybridization with a panel of
human-rodent somatic cells confirmed the localization of the GSPT1 gene
on chromosome 16 and also showed the existence of a homologous gene on
the X chromosome (GSPT2; 300418). They pointed out that a breakpoint for
nonrandom chromosome rearrangements has been found in the region of
GSPT1 in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.

123834	TITLE *123834 CYCLIN D3; CCND3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using murine cDNA clones for 3 cyclin D genes that are normally
expressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, Inaba et al. (1992)
cloned the cognate human genes. Motokura et al. (1992) also cloned the
CCND3 gene. Xiong et al. (1992) cloned CCND3 and found that all 3 human
D-type cyclin genes encode small (33-34 kD) proteins that share an
average of 57% identity over the entire coding region and 78% in the
cyclin box. The D-type cyclins are most closely related to cyclin A (39%
identity) and cyclin E (36%), followed by cyclin B (29%) and cyclin C
(21%).

GENE FUNCTION

Motokura et al. (1992) found that in normal human mammary epithelial
cells synchronized by growth factor deprivation and subsequent growth
factor stimulation, PRAD1/cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461) expression peaked in
G1 and declined before the S phase, while cyclin D3 expression rose
later in G1 and remained elevated in S.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Shen et al. (2004) identified EIF3S12
(609596) as a binding partner of cyclin D3. The interaction was mediated
by the C terminus of cyclin D3. GST pull-down experiments and transient
transfections showed that EIF3S12 and cyclin D3 bound both in vitro and
in vivo, and EIF3S12 did not bind cyclin D1 or D2 (CCND2; 123833).
Immunofluorescence revealed EIF3S12 distributed in the nucleus and
cytoplasm in a pattern that overlapped with that of cyclin D3. In
addition, overexpression of cyclin D3 upregulated the translational
activity in HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

Inaba et al. (1992) determined that all 3 cyclin D genes are interrupted
by an intron at the same position.

Wang et al. (1996) showed that the mouse cyclin D3 gene contains 5 exons
spanning about 7 kb of genomic DNA. They confirmed the activity of the
gene promoter by linking the CCND3 1,681-bp 5-prime region to a reporter
gene and transiently transfecting various cell lines. Greatest
expression of the reporter gene was detected in cell lines that normally
expressed high levels of endogenous cyclin D3 mRNA.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids containing different human
chromosomes and by fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase
spreads from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, Inaba et al. (1992)
assigned the CCND3 gene to 6p21. Motokura et al. (1992) mapped the gene
to chromosome 6 by use of human/rodent hybrids. Xiong et al. (1992)
mapped the CCND3 gene to 6p21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Xiong et al. (1992) identified a pseudogene corresponding to CCND2 and
one corresponding to CCND3 (123834). Inaba et al. (1992) found that
pseudogenes containing sequences related to cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 map
to 12p13 and 6p21, respectively.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kozar et al. (2004) tested the requirement for D-cyclins in mouse
development and in proliferation by generating mice lacking all
D-cyclins. Ccnd1 -/- Ccnd2 -/- Ccnd3 -/- mice developed until mid/late
gestation and died due to heart abnormalities combined with severe
anemia. The authors found that D-cyclins were critically required for
expansion of hematopoietic stem cells. In contrast, cyclin D-deficient
fibroblasts proliferated nearly normally, but showed increased
requirement for mitogenic stimulation in cell cycle reentry.
Proliferation of Ccnd1 -/- Ccnd2 -/- Ccnd3 -/- cells was resistant to
inhibition by p16(INK4a) (600160), but it critically depended on CDK2
(116953). Cells lacking D-cyclins displayed reduced susceptibility to
oncogenic transformation.

605301	TITLE *605301 TRANSFORMING, ACIDIC, COILED-COIL-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; TACC1
TACC1/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Amplification of various chromosomal regions in human breast carcinomas
has lead to the identification of protooncogenes involved in
tumorigenesis. For example, MYC (190080) in 8q24, CCND1 (168461) in
11q13, and ERBB2 (164870) in 17q12 are each observed in 20% of all
breast tumors. Still et al. (1999) noted that 8p11 is amplified in 10 to
15% of breast tumor samples but the only gene assigned to this region,
FGFR1 (136350), is typically expressed at the same levels in normal and
tumor breast tissue. By PCR analysis with primers obtained from an EST
database, generation of a BAC contig spanning 380 kb of the 8p11 breast
cancer amplicon-1, and probing fetal tissue libraries, Still et al.
(1999) isolated a cDNA encoding TACC1. The predicted 805-amino acid
TACC1 protein is rich in serine, proline, and acidic residues, has a
20-amino acid N terminus rich in tryptophan, contains 2 nuclear
localization signals but no DNA- or RNA-binding domains, and has a
200-residue C terminus with extensive alpha-helical segments expected to
adopt a coiled-coil structure. Northern blot analysis detected a major
8.0-kb TACC1 transcript in all tissues tested, with relatively weak
expression in liver and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Still et al. (1999) found that introduction of TACC1 into stable cell
lines resulted in morphologic changes consistent with a transformed
phenotype and in anchorage-independent growth.

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Lauffart et al.
(2002) showed that TACC1 interacted with C-terminal regions of CHTOG
(CKAP5; 611142) and GAS41 (YEATS4; 602116).

During neurogenesis, the nuclei of progenitor cells of the proliferative
ventricular zone oscillate in a cell cycle-dependent manner called
interkinetic nuclear migration (INM). In most cell types, the nucleus
closely follows the centrosome during migration; however, in neural
progenitors, centrosomes remain near the ventricular zone during INM.
Xie et al. (2007) showed that INM in mice was dependent on the
regulation of centrosome-associated microtubules by Cep120 (613446) and
Taccs. Cep120 and Taccs regulated the integrity of microtubules coupling
the centrosome and the nucleus. Cep120 interacted with Taccs and
regulated the localization of Tacc3 (605303) to the centrosome. Both
Cep120 and Taccs were essential for maintaining the neural progenitor
pool during mouse neocortical development.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Singh et al. (2012) reported that a small subset of glioblastoma
multiforme tumors (GBMs; 137800) (3.1%; 3 of 97 tumors examined) harbors
oncogenic chromosomal translocations that fuse in-frame the tyrosine
kinase coding domains of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes
FGFR1 (136350) or FGFR3 (134934) to the transforming acidic coiled-coil
(TACC) coding domains of TACC1 or TACC3 (605303), respectively. The
FGFR-TACC fusion protein displayed oncogenic activity when introduced
into astrocytes or stereotactically transduced in the mouse brain. The
fusion protein, which localizes to mitotic spindle poles, has
constitutive kinase activity and induces mitotic and chromosomal
segregation defects and triggers aneuploidy. Inhibition of FGFR kinase
corrected the aneuploidy, and oral administration of an FGFR inhibitor
prolonged survival of mice harboring intracranial FGFR3-TACC3-initiated
glioma. Singh et al. (2012) concluded that FGFR-TACC fusions could
potentially identify a subset of GBM patients who would benefit from
targeted FGFR kinase inhibition.

;;ATP-BINDING CASSETTE 7; ABC7;;
ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER 7;;
ABC TRANSPORTER 7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ABCB7 belongs to the large, highly conserved ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporter family. For background information on ABC transporters, see
300135.

CLONING

Savary et al. (1997) isolated a 2,684-bp mouse cDNA of a novel ABC
transporter, Abc7, from a macrophage cDNA library. Beginning with the
first ATG at 196, the Abc7 cDNA is predicted to encode a 629-amino acid
protein with 6 transmembrane segments followed by a canonical
ATP-binding cassette, features typical of a half-transporter. A search
of the human EST databases identified a 1,109-bp clone from a fetal
liver spleen cDNA library that showed 92% nucleotide sequence identity
to mouse Abc7. The putative protein product encoded by this clone is 94%
identical to the C-terminal 340 amino acids of mouse Abc7. These high
sequence identities led Savary et al. (1997) to conclude that the EST
clone is the human ortholog of Abc7. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 3-kb ABC7 transcript in human heart, skeletal muscle,
pancreas, lung, liver, placenta, and several cell lines, but not in
brain. Northern blot analysis performed on mouse embryos showed that
Abc7 was expressed through all the developmental stages examined,
beginning at embryonic day 6.5. A search of sequence databases revealed
that ABC7 has the highest homology with 2 yeast ABC transporters. Since
one of these, S. Pombe Htm1, is required for heavy-metal tolerance in
yeast, Savary et al. (1997) speculated that ABC7 may be involved in
metal homeostasis. Furthermore, Savary et al. (1997) noted that diseases
due to altered

Shimada et al. (1998) identified a human EST showing high sequence
similarity to the mouse Abc7 gene and the yeast ATM1 gene, which encodes
an ABC half-transporter located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. To
obtain the complete human ABC7 cDNA sequence, they isolated additional
cDNAs from a human fetal brain cDNA library. The predicted 752-amino
acid ABC7 protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and an N-terminal
mitochondrial targeting sequence. Human ABC7 has 92% and 49% amino acid
sequence identity with mouse Abc7 and yeast ATM1, respectively. Northern
blot analysis of human tissues detected a single 2.6-kb ABC7 transcript
that was strongly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart. Shimada et al.
(1998) suggested that ABC7 is a half-transporter involved in the
transport of heme from the mitochondria to the cytosol.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bekri et al. (2000) determined that the ABCB7 gene contains 16 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Savary et al. (1997) mapped the human and
mouse ABC7 genes to chromosomes Xq12-q13 and XC-XD, respectively,
regions that show homology of synteny.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Shimada et al. (1998) refined the
localization of the human ABC7 gene to chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (ASAT; 301310) is a recessive
disorder characterized by an infantile to early childhood onset of
nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia and mild anemia with hypochromia and
microcytosis. The ABC7 gene maps to the region (Xq13) harboring the ASAT
gene, mutations in which would cause the phenotype of X-linked
sideroblastic anemia with ataxia. ABC7 is an ortholog of the yeast ATM1
gene, whose product localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and is
involved in iron homeostasis. Allikmets et al. (1999) cloned the
full-length ABC7 cDNA and screened the entire coding region for
mutations in a kindred in which 5 male members manifested ASAT. A
missense mutation (300135.0001) was identified in a predicted
transmembrane segment of the ABC7 gene in these patients and was found
to segregate with the disease in the family. The mutation was not
detected in at least 600 chromosomes of general population controls.
Introduction of the corresponding mutation into the ATM1 gene of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in a partial loss of function of the
yeast ATM1 protein. In addition, the human wildtype ABC7 protein was
able to complement ATM1 deletion in yeast. The data indicated that ABC7
is the causal gene of ASAT and that ASAT is a mitochondrial disease
caused by mutation in the nuclear genome.

Bekri et al. (2000) identified a second missense mutation in the ABC7
gene (300135.0002) as the cause of sideroblastic anemia with cerebellar
ataxia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pondarre et al. (2006) found that mouse embryonic stem cells and male
mouse embryos expressing a conditionally deleted Abcb7 allele were not
viable. Maternally-inherited Abcb7 deletion was lethal to female
embryos. By breeding a series of conditionally deleted transgenic lines,
Pondarre et al. (2006) demonstrated that lethality was due to a defect
in extraembryonic visceral endoderm, which, like all other
extraembryonic tissue, preferentially maintains the female X chromosome
as the active allele. X-inactivation assays and tissue-specific deletion
showed that Abcb7 was essential in all tissues except hepatocytes and
endothelial cells. In liver, loss of Abcb7 resulted in mild
mitochondrial injury, impaired cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly, and
altered iron sensing by Irp1 (ACO1; 100880), which contributed to
dysregulation of hepatocyte iron metabolism and increased total liver
iron.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ANEMIA, SIDEROBLASTIC, AND SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA
ABCB7, ILE400MET

In the family with sideroblastic anemia and ataxia (301310) reported by
Pagon et al. (1985), Allikmets et al. (1999) identified a missense
mutation, ile400 to met, in the ABC7 gene.

.0002
ANEMIA, SIDEROBLASTIC, AND SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA
ABCB7, GLU433LYS

Bekri et al. (2000) described a family in which affected males with
sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (301310) had a missense mutation in
exon 10 of the ABC7 gene: a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1305 of the
full-length cDNA, resulting in a charge inversion caused by the
substitution of lysine for glutamate at residue 433 C-terminal to the
putative sixth transmembrane domain of ABC7. In the older brother,
congenital ataxia had been diagnosed at the age of 4. The ataxia was
nonprogressive after computed tomography of the brain at age 18 showed
striking, selective cerebellar hypoplasia. The mother's blood film
showed dimorphism, consistent with an X-linked defect. The anemia was
refractory to treatment with pyridoxine.

.0003
ANEMIA, SIDEROBLASTIC, AND SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA
ABCB7, VAL411LEU

Maguire et al. (2001) studied 2 brothers with sideroblastic anemia with
ataxia (301310). They had hypochromic red cells and increased
erythrocyte protoporphyrin despite normal iron stores. The mother was
unaffected by ataxia and had normal iron stores but showed evidence of
some red cell hypochromia with heavy basophilic stippling that stained
positive for iron. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed the presence of ring
sideroblasts in one of the brothers. Direct sequencing of the ABCB7 gene
demonstrated hemizygosity in the brothers and heterozygosity in the
mother for a G-to-C transversion at position 1299 of the cDNA sequence.
This predicted a val411-to-leu (V411L) substitution at the beginning of
the last of 6 putative transmembrane regions of the protein. An uncle
affected by ataxia also carried this mutation.

613746	TITLE *613746 BREAST CANCER ANTIESTROGEN RESISTANCE 4; BCAR4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes involved in antiestrogen resistance in breast
cancer, Godinho et al. (2010) identified BCAR4. The deduced BCAR4
protein contains 2 transmembrane domains.

GENE FUNCTION

Godinho et al. (2010) found that upregulation of BCAR4 mRNA in breast
cancer was associated with unfavorable response to tamoxifen treatment
and poor survival. Transfection of BCAR4 into ZR-75-1 breast cancer
cells increased the phosphorylation of ERBB2 (164870) and ERBB3
(190151), resulting in activation of AKT (see 164730) and ERK1 (MAPK3;
601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948). Knockdown of ERBB2, ERBB3, or ERBB4
(600543) via small interfering RNA inhibited proliferation in
BCAR4-overexpressing cells in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen or
estradiol.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the BCAR4 gene to chromosome 16p13.13 based on an
alignment of the BCAR4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK CR606007) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Nemo/Ikk-gamma (IKBKG; 300248) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen, Leonardi et al. (2000) cloned CIKS from a human liver cDNA
library. The deduced 574-amino acid protein contains a C-terminal
leucine zipper. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues
indicated ubiquitous expression of a 2.5-kb transcript.

Li et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding ACT1 from a cDNA library
constructed from embryonic kidney cells induced to display constitutive
activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011). The deduced
574-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 60 kD and
contains a helix-loop-helix domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain.
The helix-loop-helix domain shares 35% identity with the
helix-loop-helix domain of upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF1; 191523).
Northern blot analysis detected highest expression in thymus, kidney,
and placenta, moderate expression in heart, skeletal muscle, colon,
liver, lung, and small intestine, and low expression in brain, spleen,
and peripheral blood leukocytes.

By screening thymus, skeletal muscle, and fetal liver cDNA libraries,
Morelli et al. (2000) identified 3 isoforms of ACT1 that they designated
C6ORF4, C6ORF5, and C6ORF6. C6ORF4 encodes a deduced 575-amino acid
protein. C6ORF5 and C6ORF6 result from the skipping of exon 2 and are
differentiated by use of alternate polyadenylation signals, yielding
identical proteins of 566 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected
5.0- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all tissues examined, with a weak 3.8-kb
transcript in heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Leonardi et al. (2000) verified the interaction between CIKS and
IKK-gamma by in vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins and by
coimmunoprecipitation of lysates of transfected HeLa cells or
untransfected Jurkat T-leukemic cells. IKK-alpha (CHUK; 600664) and
IKK-beta (IKBKB; 603258) also coimmunoprecipitated with CIKS. Using
truncation mutants, the authors localized the binding domain to the N
terminus of CIKS. HeLa cells transfected with increasing amounts of CIKS
showed dose-dependent activation of an Ig kappa-B luciferase reporter
plasmid, and the activation could be blocked by cotransfection with
IKK-gamma. Cotransfection of CIKS with kinase-deficient mutants of NIK
(MAP3K14; 604655), MEKK1 (MAP3K1: 600982), IKK-alpha, and IKK-beta
indicated that CIKS activates NFKB exclusively through an IKK-dependent
mechanism. Overexpressed CIKS also potently activated SAPK/JNK (MAPK8;
601158). Analysis of the binding activity of truncation mutants showed
that the C terminus of CIK is involved in SAPK/JNK activation, whereas
the N terminus is necessary and sufficient for kappa-B reporter
activation.

Using gel shift assays, Li et al. (2000) confirmed constitutive
activation of NFKB with transfection of ACT1 into human embryonic kidney
cells. They also found constitutive activation of JNK and IKK.
Disruption of the N-terminal helix-loop-helix domain of ACT1 completely
abolished the interaction between ACT1 and the IKK complex as well as
the activation of NFKB.

By mutation analysis, Pacifico et al. (2003) identified a sequence in
the 5-prime flanking region of human CIKS that was essential for basal
promoter activity in a canine kidney cell line. RT-PCR, Northern, and
Western blot analyses showed that various proinflammatory cytokines
upregulated CIKS expression in HeLa cells.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Qian et al. (2007) found that IL17
(603149) induced association of ACT1 with IL17RA (605461) in various
cell types. The ACT1-IL17RA interaction required the SEFIR domain of
IL17RA. Expression of Il17-dependent inflammation-related genes was
abolished in Act1-deficient mouse cells. Mice lacking Act1 had delayed
onset and lower severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, as
well as limited colitis. Qian et al. (2007) concluded that ACT1 is
essential for IL17-dependent signaling in autoimmune and inflammatory
disease.

GENE STRUCTURE

Morelli et al. (2000) determined that the ACT1 gene contains 10 exons
and spans more than 50 kb. They also identified C6UAS, which overlaps
exon 2 and is transcribed in the antisense orientation from the
complementary strand of C6ORF4. C6UAS has no apparent open reading
frame, but Morelli et al. (2000) provided experimental evidence that it
has a regulatory function and can behave as an antisense RNA in the
control of C6ORF4 translation.

Pacifico et al. (2003) mapped the CIKS transcription start site and
found that the 5-prime flanking region was TATA-less, but it had
initiator, GC, and CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Morelli et al. (2000) identified ACT1 within an EST clone that maps to
chromosome 6q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ellinghaus et al. (2010) and Huffmeier et al. (2010) independently
identified association of a coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),
dbSNP rs33980500 (607043.0001), in the TRAF3IP2 gene with psoriasis
susceptibility (PSORS13; 614070).

In a case-control genomewide association study of psoriasis
susceptibility (PSORS13; 614070), Ellinghaus et al. (2010) identified a
coding SNP, dbSNP rs33980500, in exon 2 of the TRAF3IP2 gene. A C-to-T
transition results in substitution of asn for asp at codon 19 (D19N).
This SNP was significantly associated with risk for psoriasis vulgaris
(P = 1.24 x 10(-16)) and psoriatic arthritis (P = 4.57 x 10(-12)).

In an independent case-control genomewide association study, Huffmeier
et al. (2010) found significant association of dbSNP rs33980500 with
psoriatic arthritis in a subset of cases and controls (P = 1.13 x
10(-20), OR = 1.95). Functional assays showed reducing binding of this
TRAF3IP2 variant to TRAF6 (602355), suggesting altered modulation of
immunoregulatory signals through altered TRAF interactions as a novel
and shared pathway for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis vulgaris.
Huffmeier et al. (2010) referred to the amino acid change correlated
with this SNP as ASP10ASN.

609000	TITLE *609000 MONOOXYGENASE, DBH-LIKE, 1; MOXD1
;;MONOOXYGENASE X; MOX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display of genes showing altered expression during
senescence in human diploid fibroblasts, Chambers et al. (1998) cloned
MOXD1, which they called MOX. The 3-prime UTR contains multiple
consensus polyadenylation signals. The deduced 545-amino acid protein
has several cysteine residues likely to be involved in disulfide bond
formation. It also has a subset of cysteines within the catalytic core
that are conserved with DBH (223360) and PAM (170270), as well as other
conserved residues that are likely to coordinate copper and contribute
to enzymatic activity. The catalytic core regions of MOX and DBH share
about 40% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis detected a MOX
transcript of about 3.3 kb in fibroblasts, and Northern blot analysis of
several tissues showed highest expression in lung, kidney, and brain.
RT-PCR analysis and RNA dot blot analysis confirmed highest expression
in kidney and lung, and MOX was also expressed in testis, fetal kidney,
uterus, and adrenal gland. Western blot analysis detected endogenous MOX
at an apparent molecular mass of 62.6 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Chambers et al. (1998) found that most primary fibroblast or umbilical
vein endothelial cell cultures upregulated MOX expression during
replicative senescence.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Chambers et al. (1998) mapped the MOX gene
to chromosome 6q.

614184	TITLE *614184 DIS3 MITOTIC CONTROL, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE 2; DIS3L2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNA exosome is an approximately 400-kD multimeric ribonucleolytic
complex that participates in both endonucleolytic and 3-prime/5-prime
exonucleolytic activity in RNA processing and in the degradation of a
variety of RNA substrates. DIS3L2 shares high sequence similarity with
catalytic exosome subunits that have 3-prime/5-prime exonucleolytic
activity (summary by Tomecki et al., 2010).

CLONING

By searching the human genomic database for sequences similar to DIS3L
(614183), Staals et al. (2010) identified 5 potential splice variants of
DIS3L2. The longest deduced protein contains 885 amino acids and has a
calculated molecular mass of 99.2 kD. It has a poorly conserved
N-terminal PIN domain, followed by a cold-shock domain, a putative RNB
exonuclease catalytic domain, and a possible C-terminal S1 RNA-binding
domain.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DIS3L2 gene to chromosome 2q37.2 based on an
alignment of the DIS3L2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC030113) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

In transfected COS-7 and HeLa cells, Astuti et al. (2012) observed that
DIS3L2 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. RNA degradation
assays using transfected HEK293 cells demonstrated that DIS3L2 has
exonuclease activity. Knockdown studies in HeLa cells showed that DIS3L2
inactivation was associated with mitotic abnormalities and altered
expression of mitotic checkpoint proteins, with lowered expression of
TTK (604092), aurora B (AURKB; 604970), and phosphorylated CDC25C
(157680), but upregulation of cyclin B1 (CCNB1; 123836), RAD21 (606462),
and securin (PTTG1; 604147). DIS3L2 overexpression suppressed the growth
of human cancer cell lines, and knockdown enhanced the growth of those
cells. Astuti et al. (2012) concluded that DIS3L2 has a critical role in
RNA metabolism and is essential for the regulation of cell growth and
division.

The pluripotency factor LIN28 (611043) blocks the expression of LET7
(605386) microRNAs in undifferentiated cells during development by
binding to pre-LET7 RNAs and recruiting RNA uridyltransferases ZCCHC11
(613692) and ZCCHC6 to uridylate pre-LET7. The identity of the RNase
that degrades uridylated pre-LET7 was unknown. Chang et al. (2013)
identified Dis3l2 as the 3-prime-5-prime exonuclease responsible for the
decay of uridylated pre-let7 in mouse embryonic stem cells. Biochemical
reconstitution assays showed that 3-prime oligouridylation stimulates
Dis3l2 activity in vitro, and knockdown of Dis3l2 in mouse embryonic
stem cells leads to the stabilization of pre-let7. Chang et al. (2013)
concluded that their study established 3-prime oligouridylation as an
RNA decay signal for DIS3L2 and identified the first physiologic RNA
substrate of this exonuclease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 8 affected individuals from 6 families with Perlman syndrome (PRLMNS;
267000), Astuti et al. (2012) identified homozygosity or compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the DIS3L2 gene
(614184.0001-614184.0004).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PERLMAN SYNDROME
DIS3L2, 82.8-KB DEL, EX6DEL

In a brother and sister from a consanguineous Pakistani family with
Perlman syndrome (267000), Astuti et al. (2012) identified homozygosity
for an 82.8-kb deletion (367-41553_602+40962del) between exons 5 and 7
of the DIS3L2 gene, resulting in a truncated protein of 258 amino acids.
Functional studies in HEK293 cells demonstrated that mutant DIS3L2
lacking exon 6 had substantially reduced ribonuclease activity. The
mutation segregated with disease in the family and was not found in at
least 300 ancestrally matched samples. The brother died at 3.5 years of
age and the sister at 2 months of age.

.0002
PERLMAN SYNDROME
DIS3L2, 22-KB DEL, EX9DEL

In 3 patients from 2 Dutch families with Perlman syndrome (267000),
previously reported by Henneveld et al. (1999), as well as an unrelated
Dutch infant with this syndrome, Astuti et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for an approximately 22-kb deletion (951-?_1124+?del)
between exons 8 and 10 of the DIS3L2 gene, resulting in loss of the RNB
domain (gln318_arg375del). Functional studies in HEK293 cells
demonstrated that mutant DIS3L2 lacking exon 9 had substantially reduced
ribonuclease activity. The mutation segregated with disease in both
families and was not found in at least 300 ancestrally matched samples.
All 4 Dutch patients died in infancy. In addition, in a cell line from a
30-week amniotic fluid sample from a male patient with Perlman syndrome,
the exon 9 deletion was found in compound heterozygosity with a 1466G-A
transition in the DIS3L2 gene, resulting in a cys489-to-tyr (C489Y;
614184.0003) substitution at a highly conserved residue.

PERLMAN SYNDROME
DIS3L2, IVS19, G-A, +5

In a cell line taken from a 14-year-old girl with Perlman syndrome
(267000), previously reported by Neri et al. (1984), Astuti et al.
(2012) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in exon 19
(2394+5G-A) of the DIS3L2 gene, predicted to cause skipping or deletion
of exon 19. The mutation segregated with disease in the family and was
not found in at least 300 ancestrally matched control samples. Although
a second mutation was not detected, only the transcript lacking exon 19
was found, suggesting the presence of another mutation that might
abolish transcription or cause mRNA instability.

600367	TITLE *600367 CLEAVAGE STIMULATION FACTOR, 3-PRIME PRE-RNA, SUBUNIT 3, 77-KD; CSTF3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors is a complex process that requires
multiple protein factors, including cleavage stimulation factor (CSTF),
a cleavage-polyadenylation specificity factor (see 603052), 2 cleavage
factors, and poly(A)+ polymerase. CSTF is composed of 3 subunits: CSTF1
(600369), CSFT2 (300907), and CSTF3 (Takagaki and Manley, 1994).

CLONING

Takagaki and Manley (1994) cloned human CSTF3, which encodes a 77-kD
protein homologous to Drosophila 'suppressor of forked' (suf) and yeast
Rna14, both of which are involved in mRNA processing.

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 11 associated with WAGR
syndrome (194072), Gawin et al. (1999) identified and cloned CSTF3.
Northern blot analysis of several human tissues detected a 3.2-kb
transcript predominantly in lung. In mouse, Cstf3 expression was strong
during embryonic development beginning at embryonic day 11 and much
weaker in adult tissues.

MAPPING

By analysis of a PAC contig covering chromosome 11p14.1-p13, Gawin et
al. (1999) mapped the CSTF3 gene to chromosome 11p13, centromeric to the
TR2 gene (DEPDC7; 612294) and telomeric to the G2 gene (C11ORF41;
612297).

DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the TTC39B gene to chromosome 9p22.3 based on an
alignment of the TTC39B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK091187) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Teslovich et al. (2010) found that knockdown in mouse liver of the
ortholog Ttc39b via a viral vector resulted in significantly higher
plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Teslovich et al. (2010) performed a genomewide association study of
plasma lipids in more than 100,000 individuals of European ancestry and
reported 95 significantly associated loci (P = less than 5 x 10(-8)),
with 59 showing genomewide significant association with lipid traits for
the first time. The 95 loci contributed not only to normal variation in
lipid traits but also to extreme lipid phenotypes and affected lipid
traits in 3 non-European populations (East Asians, South Asians, and
African Americans). Teslovich et al. (2010) identified dbSNP rs581080, a
SNP in the TTC39B gene on chromosome 9p22, as having an effect on HDL-C
concentrations with an effect size of -0.65 mg per deciliter and a P
value of 3 x 10(-12). In liver, the allele associated with decreased
expression correlated with increased HDL-C.

615150	TITLE *615150 MICRO RNA 191; MIR191
;;miRNA191
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Micro RNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR191, are conserved small noncoding RNAs
that bind to complementary sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target
mRNAs, inhibiting their translation and/or inducing their degradation
(Lena et al., 2012).

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray analysis, Lena et al. (2012) found that MIR191 was
significantly upregulated in normal human neonatal epidermal
keratinocytes (HEKn) following development of senescence in culture.
Bioinformatic analysis and reporter gene assays revealed functional
MIR191 target sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of transcripts for the cell
cycle regulator CDK6 (603368) and the AT-rich binding protein SATB1
(602075). Western blot analysis confirmed that ectopic expression of
MIR191 in HEKn cells caused downregulation of SATB1 and CDK6,
concomitant with decreased cell proliferation and expression of
senescence markers.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the MIR191 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the mature MIR191 sequence (CAACGGAAUCCCAAAAGCAGCUG) with
the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;PALB, ASPERGILLUS NIDULANS, HOMOLOG OF; PALBH
DESCRIPTION Calpain is an intracellular, nonlysosomal cysteine protease whose
activity is regulated by calcium. Micro- and millicalpains (CAPN1,
114220, and CAPN2, 114230, respectively), which differ in their calcium
requirements for protease activity, are ubiquitously expressed. Other
calpains are expressed in specific tissues, such as CAPN3 (114240) and
CAPN9 (606401), which are predominant in skeletal muscle and
gastrointestinal tissue, respectively (Huang and Wang, 2001).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of the atypical Aspergillus
calpain Palb, followed by RACE, Futai et al. (2001) obtained cDNAs
encoding mouse and human CAPN7, which they termed PALBH. The deduced
814-amino acid human protein contains a calpain-like cysteine protease
domain and a C-terminal PBH domain. Northern blot analysis revealed wide
expression of a 3.8-kb CAPN7 transcript. Expression was strong in
pancreas, moderate in skeletal muscle, liver, and placenta, and weak in
kidney, lung, brain, and heart. Western blot analysis detected
expression of a 92-kD protein. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated nuclear expression of CAPN7, unlike other calpains.
Functional analysis could not demonstrate complementation in mutant
yeast or activity against conventional calpain substrates.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Futai et al. (2001) mapped the CAPN7 gene
to 3p24.

MICRO RNA 369-5p, INCLUDED; MIR369-5p, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that recruit an Argonaute (AGO)
protein complex to a complementary target mRNA, which results in
translation repression or degradation of the mRNA. The MIR369 precursor
stem-loop sequence encodes 2 mature miRNAs, MIR369-5p and MIR369-3p,
from its 5-prime and 3-prime ends, respectively (Altuvia et al., 2005;
Vasudevan et al., 2007).

CLONING

By database and sequence analysis, Altuvia et al. (2005) identified
MIR369-5p and MIR369-3p, which lie on the 5-prime and 3-prime ends,
respectively, of the MIR369 precursor stem-loop structure. They cloned
MIR369-5p and MIR369-3p from a pituitary gland cDNA library.

Vasudevan et al. (2007) identified MIR369-3p, which they called
MIR369-3, as a microRNA with a seed region complementary to the AU-rich
element (ARE) of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA; 191160). The mature
MIR369-3p sequence is AAUAAUACAUGGUUGAUCUUU.

GENE FUNCTION

AU-rich elements (AREs) and microRNA target sites are conserved
sequences in mRNA 3-prime UTRs that control gene expression
posttranscriptionally. Upon cell cycle arrest, the ARE in tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNFA; 191160) mRNA is transformed into a translation
activation signal, recruiting Argonaute (AGO; see 606228) and fragile X
mental retardation-related protein-1 (FXR1; 600819), factors associated
with microribonucleoproteins (microRNPs). Vasudevan et al. (2007) showed
that human MIR369-3p directs association of these proteins with the AREs
to activate translation. Furthermore, Vasudevan et al. (2007) documented
that 2 well-studied microRNAs, Let7 (see 605386) and the synthetic
microRNA miRcxcr4, likewise induced translation upregulation of target
mRNAs on cell cycle arrest, yet they repressed translation in
proliferating cells. Thus, Vasudevan et al. (2007) concluded that
activation is a common function of microRNPs on cell cycle arrest. They
proposed that translation regulation by microRNPs oscillates between
repression and activation during the cell cycle.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Altuvia et al. (2005) mapped the MIR369
gene within a miRNA cluster on chromosome 14 that includes MIR409
(614057).

Gross (2011) mapped the MIR369 gene to chromosome 14q32.31 based on an
alignment of the MIR369 stem-loop sequence
(UUGAAGGGAGAUCGACCGUGUUAUAUUCGCUUUAUUGACUUCGAAUAAUACAUGGUUGAUCUUUUCUCAG)
with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN146A, are an evolutionarily conserved
class of endogenous 22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs involved in

from long primary transcripts through a 60-bp hairpin precursor step
into mature forms by sequential cutting with 2 RNase III enzymes, Drosha
(RNASEN; 608828) and Dicer (606241). Mature miRNAs are then loaded onto
the ribonucleoprotein complex dubbed RISC (RNA-induced silencing
complex), where they guide recognition and translational repression or
degradation of target mRNAs (summary by Taganov et al., 2006).

CLONING

Taganov et al. (2006) stated that the human genome contains 2 miRNA146
genes, MIRN146A and MIRN146B (610567), on chromosomes 5 and 10,
respectively. They determined that MIRN146A is located within exon 2 of
the LOC285628 gene. The primary LOC285628 transcript contains no
significant ORF, suggesting it belongs to a class of noncoding RNAs.
Using RACE, Taganov et al. (2006) found that the MIRN146A primary
transcript contains 2,337 bp. The mature products of MIRN146A and
MIRN146B differ by only 2 nucleotides in the 3-prime region.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Sonkoly et al. (2007) found ubiquitous
but variable miR146A expression in human tissues. In skin, miR146A was
preferentially expressed in immune cells, with highest level in CD4
(186940)-positive/CD25 (IL2RA; 147730)-positive T cells, but was absent
from keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

By expression profiling, Taganov et al. (2006) found that the mature
forms of MIRN132 (610016), MIRN155 (609337), MIRN146A, and MIRN146B were
induced in a monocyte cell line following exposure to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). Promoter analysis of MIRN146A revealed that transcription
following LPS, TNF (191160), or IL1B (147720) exposure was dependent on
NFKB (see 164011). Luciferase reporter analysis suggested that sequences
in the 3-prime UTRs of TRAF6 (602355) and IRAK1 (300283) may basepair
with MIRN146A and MIRN146B. Taganov et al. (2006) proposed that MIRN146A
and MIRN146B may function as negative regulators of Toll-like receptors
and cytokine signaling by downregulating IRAK1 and TRAF6 protein levels.

Using microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, Sonkoly et al.
(2007) found that expression of miR146A was upregulated in psoriasis
(see 177900), but not in atopic eczema (see 603165), compared with
normal human skin.

Using microarray and Northern blot analysis, Chang et al. (2008) showed
that MIRN146A was among several miRNAs downregulated by MYC (190080) in
mouse and human B-cell lymphoma cell lines. MYC bound the MIRN146A
upstream region.

Using DNA arrays and Northern blot analysis, Lukiw et al. (2008) found
that the expression of MIR146A was significantly upregulated in
Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) neocortex and hippocampus compared with
normal control tissue. They identified a putative MIR146A-binding site
in the 3-prime UTR of CFH (134370), and confirmed that the expression of
CFH was downregulated in AD brain compared with controls. Upregulation
of MIR146A and downregulation of CFH was also found in stressed primary
human neuronal/glial cell cocultures, which is a model of AD. They
further found that MIR146A was upregulated by NF-kappa-B (see 164011)
and concluded that NF-kappa-B-sensitive MIR146A modulates the expression
of CFH as part of the inflammatory response in AD brain.

One of the most common subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 5q-
syndrome (153550), is characterized by an isolated interstitial deletion
of chromosome 5q, severe anemia, variable neutropenia, and normal or
high platelet counts with dysplastic megakaryocytes. Starczynowski et
al. (2010) postulated that loss of miRNAs encoded within the common
deleted region in 5q- syndrome may result in haploinsufficiency due to
loss of inhibition of their targets. They found that expression of
MIR145 (611795) and MIR146A was reduced in MDS patients with deletion of
chromosome 5q. Loss of both MIR145 and MIR146A resulted in activation of
innate immune signaling due to elevated expression of their respective
targets, TIRAP (606252) and TRAF6. Knockdown of both Mir145 and Mir146a
or overexpression of Traf6 in mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
(HSPCs) recapitulated several features of 5q- syndrome, including
thrombocytosis, mild neutropenia, and megakaryocytic dysplasia.
Starczynowski et al. (2010) concluded that inappropriate activation of
innate immune signals in HSPCs due to loss of miRNA-mediated inhibition
is involved in several features of 5q- syndrome.

Using RT-PCR analysis, Curtale et al. (2010) found that expression of
MIR146A was low in human naive T cells, but that it was abundant in
memory T cells, with induction initiated by T-cell receptor (TCR; see
186880) stimulation. Binding sites for NF-kappa-B and ETS (see 164720)
in the MIR146A promoter were required for induction of MIR146A
transcription upon TCR engagement. MIR146A modulated activation-induced
cell death by acting as an antiapoptotic factor, and it targeted FADD
(602457). AP1 (165160) activity and IL2 (147680) production were
impaired by MIR146A expression. Curtale et al. (2010) concluded that
several signaling pathways other than inflammation are influenced by
MIR146A.

Using mice lacking Tlr4 (603030) or the essential TLR signaling molecule
Irak1, Chassin et al. (2010) demonstrated that Mir146a mediated
translational repression and proteolytic degradation of Irak1, which was
sufficient to induce intestinal epithelial innate immune tolerance and
provide protection from bacteria-induced epithelial damage in neonates.
Intraepithelial endotoxin persistence during the neonatal period
maintained tolerance through sustained Mir146a expression and
additionally facilitated transcription of a distinct set of genes
involved in cell survival, differentiation, and homeostasis. Chassin et
al. (2010) concluded that neonatal intestinal epithelial innate immune
tolerance is an example of restriction of signaling to prevent
bacteria-induced intestinal epithelial damage during the transition
between fetal, neonatal, and adult life.

MAPPING

Taganov et al. (2006) stated that the MIRN146A gene maps to chromosome
5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Jazdzewski et al. (2008) found that the rarer C allele of a common G/C
SNP (dbSNP rs2910164) within the pre-miR-146a sequence reduced the
amount of pre- and mature miR146A 1.9- and 1.8-fold, respectively,
compared with the G allele. The SNP is located on the passenger strand
of pre-miR146A, at position +60 relative to the first nucleotide, and
the C allele is predicted to cause mispairing within the hairpin. EMSA
experiments showed that the C allele interfered with binding of HeLa
cell nuclear proteins to pre-miR146a, and it also caused inefficient
inhibition of the miR146a target genes TRAF6 and IRAK1, as well as of
PTC1 (CCDC6; 601985), in reporter gene assays. Jazdzewski et al. (2008)
genotyped 608 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC; 188550)
and 901 controls and found that GC heterozygosity was associated with
increased risk of acquiring PTC, whereas both homozygous states were
protective. They concluded that the G/C SNP alters pre-miR146a
processing and contributes to predisposition to PTC by altering
expression of miR146a target genes in the Toll-like receptor and
cytokine signaling pathway.

610106	TITLE *610106 DREBRIN-LIKE; DBNL
;;HPK1-INTERACTING PROTEIN, 55-KD; HIP55
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library using GLK
(MAP4K3; 604921) as bait, followed by EST database analysis, Ensenat et
al. (1999) cloned DBNL, which they called HIP55. The predicted 430-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 48 kD. The N terminus of
HIP55 contains a putative actin-binding domain found in drebrins (see
DBN1; 126660), which are involved in brain development, and the C
terminus contains an SH3 domain. Western blot analysis detected a 55-kD
protein. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of a
2.3-kb transcript, with highest levels in spleen and peripheral blood
leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Ensenat et al. (1999) found that HIP55
interacted with GLK and HPK1 (MAP4K1; 601983). They confirmed the
interaction with HPK1 both in vitro and in vivo. The interaction was
dependent on the SH3 domain of HIP55 and the second proline-rich domain
of HPK1. When cotransfected, HIP55 increased HPK1 kinase activity and
JNK1 (MAPK8; 601158) kinase activity. Ensenat et al. (1999) concluded
that HIP55 binds HPK1 and regulates the JNK1 signaling cascade.

Using confocal microscopy, RNA interference, and overexpression
experiments in mouse and human cell lines, Le Bras et al. (2004) found
that HIP55 did not contribute to early formation of T
cell-antigen-presenting cell (APC) conjugates. However, they identified
HIP55 as a key constituent of the immunologic synapse, regulating T-cell
activation by bridging T-cell receptors and the actin cytoskeleton to
gene activation and endocytic processes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DBNL
gene to chromosome 7 (TMAP D7S2634).

ANIMAL MODEL

Han et al. (2005) found that Hip55 -/- mice were viable and fertile, but
they showed decreased body weight and increased frequency of death
within the first 4 weeks after birth. Lymphoid organs of Hip55 -/- mice
showed normal cellularity and T-cell development. However, Hip55 -/- T
cells proliferated at a reduced level, with lower cytokine production
and lower expression of activation markers after T-cell receptor
stimulation.

603322	TITLE *603322 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 BETA SUBCOMPLEX, 6; NDUFB6
;;COMPLEX I, MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATORY CHAIN, B17 SUBUNIT; B17
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), the first multisubunit
enzyme complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, has about 43
subunits with a combined molecular mass of 970 kD. Of these, 7 subunits
are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (ND1-6, ND4L). The remaining
subunits are encoded by the nuclear genome (Smeitink et al., 1998)

CLONING

Smeitink et al. (1998) provided a table of 15 known nuclear subunits and
reported the cloning of an additional subunit, B17. The B17 cDNA encodes
a protein of 128 amino acids with a calculated relative mass of 15.5 kD.
There was 82.7% and 78.1% homology, respectively, at the cDNA and amino
acid levels with the bovine counterpart. Multi-tissue dot blots showed
ubiquitous expression of B17 mRNA, with relatively higher expression in
tissues known for their high energy demands. Of these, kidney showed the
highest expression. Mutation analysis of the subunit revealed no
mutations or polymorphisms in 20 patients with isolated enzymatic
complex I deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts.

Smeitink and van den Heuvel (1999) reviewed the available molecular data
regarding the human nuclear-encoding complex I subunits.

MAPPING

By searching the GenBank STS database using the cDNA sequence of the
human B17 subunit, Smeitink et al. (1998) mapped the NDUFB6 gene
(GenBank GENBANK G30177) to chromosome 2. However, by radiation hybrid
analysis, Emahazion et al. (1998) mapped the NDUFB6 gene to 9p13.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

NDUFB6 is among the set of OXPHOS genes showing significant reduction in
muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes (125853) compared with healthy
control subjects (Mootha et al., 2003; see 604517). In a study of young
and elderly twins with and without type 2 diabetes, Ling et al. (2007)
found that expression of NDUFB6 in skeletal muscle decreased with age. A
-544A-G polymorphism in the NDUFB6 promoter region (dbSNP rs629566) that
creates a possible DNA methylation site was associated with a decline in
muscle NDUFB6 expression with age; increased DNA methylation was found
in the promoter of elderly but not young subjects carrying the G/G
genotype. The degree of DNA methylation correlated negatively with
muscle NDUFB6 expression, which, in turn, was associated with insulin
sensitivity. Ling et al. (2007) suggested that genetic and epigenetic
factors may interact to increase age-dependent susceptibility to insulin
resistance.

125305	TITLE *125305 ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN BAND 4.9; EPB49
;;DEMATIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dematin, or EPB49, is an actin-bundling protein originally identified in
the erythroid membrane skeleton. Its actin-bundling activity is
abolished upon phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and is
restored after dephosphorylation (Rana et al., 1993).

CLONING

Chishti et al. (1989) proposed the name dematin (from the Greek 'dema,'
a bundle) for an actin-bundling protein identified in the human
erythroid membrane skeleton. Rana et al. (1993) noted that dematin
consists of 2 polypeptide chains of 48 and 52 kD that were identified as
protein 4.9 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In solution, dematin exists as a
trimer and bundles actin filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent
manner. Rana et al. (1993) cloned dematin from a human reticulocyte cDNA
library. The deduced 383-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 43 kD. Dematin has a polyglutamine motif that may constitute a
nuclear localization signal, a PEST sequence, a C-terminal domain highly
similar to the C-terminal headpiece domain of villin (VIL; 193040), and
several putative phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected
variable dematin expression in all tissues examined. Immunofluorescence
microscopy revealed punctate dematin staining around the cell nucleus in
cultured human erythroblasts.

Although dematin is an actin-bundling protein of the erythroid membrane
skeleton, it is abundantly expressed in human brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and lung. Azim et al. (1995) reported the primary
structure of the 52-kD subunit of dematin, which differs from the 48-kD
subunit by a 22-amino acid insertion within its headpiece domain. A
unique feature of the insertion sequence of the 52-kD subunit is its
homology to erythrocyte protein 4.2 (177070).

GENE FUNCTION

Rana et al. (1993) confirmed that purified human dematin possessed
actin-bundling activity in vitro. Protease treatment and microsequencing
revealed that the C-terminal headpiece domain bound actin filaments, but
it did not have actin-bundling activity.

Azim et al. (1996) demonstrated that dematin and protein 4.2 bound ATP.

Gilligan and Bennett (1993) provided a review.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid panels and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Azim et al. (1995) localized the dematin gene to chromosome 8p21.1, a
site distal to the locus of ankyrin (612641) at chromosome 8p11.2.

Peters et al. (1995) demonstrated that the murine dematin gene,
symbolized Epb4.9, maps to chromosome 14. They raised the possibility
that dematin mutations may be involved in neurologic abnormalities in
the mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

By using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells, Khanna
et al. (2002) deleted the headpiece domain of dematin to evaluate its
function in vivo. Dematin headpiece-null mice were viable and born at
the expected mendelian ratio. Hematologic evaluation showed evidence of
compensated anemia and spherocytosis in these mice, however. The
headpiece-null erythrocytes were osmotically fragile, and displayed
reduced deformability and filterability. In vitro, significantly greater
membrane fragmentation of these erythrocytes was demonstrated.
Biochemical characterization showed a weakened membrane skeleton
evidenced by reduced association of spectrin and actin to the plasma
membrane. Together, these results provided evidence for the physiologic
significance of dematin and demonstrated a role for the headpiece domain
in the maintenance of structural integrity and mechanical properties of
red cells in vivo.

Chen et al. (2007) created double-knockout mice lacking beta-adducin
(ADD2; 102681) and the headpiece domain of dematin. Double-knockout pups
were pale compared with wildtype pups, but otherwise they appeared
grossly normal. Peripheral blood analysis showed severe hemolytic anemia
with reduced number of erythrocytes/hematocrit/hemoglobin and an
approximately 12-fold increase in the number of circulating
reticulocytes. The presence of a variety of misshapen and fragmented
erythrocytes correlated with increased osmotic fragility and reduced in
vivo life span. Mutant erythrocyte membranes showed weak retention of
spectrin-actin complexes, increased grain size, decreased filament
number, and features consistent with the presence of large protein
aggregates. Chen et al. (2007) concluded that dematin and adducin are
essential for the maintenance of erythrocyte shape and membrane
stability.

;;miRNA152;;
MIRN152
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs, such as MIR152, are noncoding RNAs of 18 to 24 nucleotides
that bind the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs and control protein
expression through translational repression or mRNA degradation. MIR148B
regulates the innate immune response (Liu et al., 2010).

GENE FUNCTION

Using computer and functional analyses, Liu et al. (2010) identified 3
members of the MIR148 family, Mir148a (613786), Mir148b (613787), and
Mir152, as negative regulators of the innate immune response and the
antigen-presenting capacity of mouse dendritic cells (DCs). Expression
of Mir148a, Mir148b, and Mir152 was upregulated in mouse DCs on
maturation and activation induced by Tlr3 (603029), Tlr4 (603030), and
Tlr9 (605474) agonists. In contrast, expression of Camk2a (114078), an
important DC regulator, was downregulated in the presence of these
agonists. Mir148/Mir152 overexpression inhibited production of
cytokines, including Il12 (see 161560), Il6 (147620), Tnf (191160), and
Ifnb, (147640), upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class
II expression, and DC-initiated antigen-specific T-cell proliferation by
targeting Camk2a expression. Liu et al. (2010) proposed that MIR148A,
MIR148B, and MIR152 fine tune the innate immune response.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the MIR152 gene to chromosome 17q21.32 based on an
alignment of the mature MIR152 sequence (UCAGUGCAUGACAGAACUUGG) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607391	TITLE *607391 SINGLE-STRANDED DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 4; SSBP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the SSBP2 (607389) sequence as probe,
Castro et al. (2002) identified 2 additional members of the SSBP gene
family, SSBP3 (607390) and SSBP4. All 3 SSBP genes share homology with
the chicken gene CSDP, which encodes a protein that binds
single-stranded pyrimidine-rich mirror-repeat elements with high
specificity. The deduced 364-amino acid SSBP4 protein shares 73% and 72%
sequence identity with human SSBP2 and SSBP3, respectively. SSBP family
members share a highly conserved N terminus followed by a glycine- and
proline-rich domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Castro et al. (2002) determined that the SSBP2, SSBP3, and SSBP4 genes
all contain 17 exons and have identical intron/exon boundaries,
suggesting duplication from a common ancestral gene. They also
identified alternative splicing and additional internal exons for all 3
genes, suggesting the existence of multiple isoforms for each protein.
The SSBP4 gene spans less than 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Castro et al. (2002) mapped the SSBP4 gene
to chromosome 19p13.1, between markers D19S899 and D19S407.

611411	TITLE *611411 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE KINASE 1, ALPHA; CAMKK1
;;CAMKK-ALPHA; CAMKKA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CAMKK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation and activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin
kinase (CaMK) as an upstream component of the CaMK cascade that has been
implicated in neuronal gene transcription, synaptic plasticity, and
long-term memory consolidation (Blaeser et al., 2006).

CLONING

By screening a rat brain cDNA library using partial amino acid sequence
of a 68-kD purified rat brain CaMK kinase, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Tokumitsu et al. (1995) cloned rat Camkk1. The deduced 505-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 56 kD. Camkk1 shares 30 to
40% amino acid identity over the catalytic domains of serine/threonine
kinases such as the CaM-kinase family (see CAMK2A; 114078). Camkk1
contains a 22-amino acid proline-, arginine-, and glycine-rich insert
between the ATP-binding motif and DGF kinase motif that is similar to
the insert in yeast Ste11. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues
detected high expression in forebrain, lower expression in cerebellum,
and detectable signal in thymus and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Western blot analysis or gel overlay, Tokumitsu et al. (1995)
showed that Camkk1 binds calmodulin (CALM1; 114180) and activated Camk4
(114080) with a 6-fold increase in total activity and a 100-fold
increase in Camk4 Ca(2+)-independent activity. Camkk1 catalyzed a
10-fold increase in the total activity of Camk1 (604998) and had no
effect on Camk2 (see CAMK2A; 114078). Cotransfection of COS-7 cells with
Camkk1 and Camk4 resulted in a 14-fold increase in CRE-binding protein
(CREB1; 123810)-dependent transcription compared with Camk4 alone,
suggesting that Camkk1 enhances Camk4-mediated transcriptional
regulation.

Using pharmacologic inhibitors to block potential pathways involved in
cytomegalovirus (CMV)-mediated activation of glycolysis, McArdle et al.
(2011) found that inhibition of CAMKK, but not CAMK2 or protein kinase A
(PKA; see 176911), blocked CMV-mediated glycolysis activation. CMV
infection also induced CAMKK1 mRNA and protein expression. Inhibition of
CAMKK had a negligible impact on CMV immediate-early protein
accumulation, but it severely attenuated production of CMV viral
progeny, reduced expression of 1 early CMV gene, and blocked viral DNA
replication. CAMKK inhibition had no impact on herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1-induced glycolytic activation and a limited impact on HSV-1
replication. McArdle et al. (2011) concluded that CAMKK has a role that
is CMV specific and that it is an important factor in both CMV
replication and glycolytic activation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CAMKK1
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-32989).

ANIMAL MODEL

Blaeser et al. (2006) generated mice with targeted disruption of Camkk1
and carried out a variety of behavioral and learning and memory tests.
Mutant mice exhibited normal long-term spatial memory, cued fear memory,
basal synaptic transmission, and long-term potentiation. However, mutant
mice displayed deficient long-term contextual fear memory, as measured
in the post-shock freezing response. Mutant mice displayed decreased
stress-induced anxiety-like behavior; however, other measures of anxiety
such as the elevated plus maze and open field tests showed no difference
from wildtype. Blaeser et al. (2006) concluded that Camkk1 plays a
selective role in contextual fear memory. They showed that mice lacking
Camkk1 displayed decreased phosphorylation and activation of Camk4 and
Creb in specific brain areas involved in contextual fear memory
formation.

182175	TITLE *182175 SIGNAL RECOGNITION PARTICLE, 19-KD; SRP19
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ribonucleoprotein complex
that mediates the targeting of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). The complex consists of a 7S (or 7SL) RNA and 6 different
proteins, SRP9 (600707), SRP14 (600708), SRP19, SRP54 (604857), SRP68
(604858), and SRP72 (602122). The proteins are bound to the 7S RNA as
monomers (SRP19 and SRP54) or heterodimers (SRP9/SRP14 and SRP68/SRP72).
SRP9 and SRP14 bind to the Alu domain of the SRP, whereas the other 4
proteins belong to the S domain. SRP has at least 3 distinct functions
that can be associated with the protein subunits: signal recognition,
translational arrest, and ER membrane targeting by interaction with the
docking protein.

For information on a signal recognition particle database, see Larsen et
al. (1998).

By screening a liver cDNA library with an anti-SRP19 probe, Lingelbach
et al. (1988) isolated a human SRP19 cDNA encoding a 144-amino acid
protein. Sequence analysis showed that SRP19 contains a very basic
C-terminal domain of 7 lysine residues interrupted by 2 glycine
residues. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 0.9 kb
transcript in HeLa cells. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that SRP19 is
expressed as a 19-kD protein, identical in size to canine SRP19.
Functional analysis determined that the SRP19 protein binds to 7SL RNA
in canine pancreas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Groden et al. (1991) determined that the SRP19 gene consists of 5 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

In 2 small nested deletions of 100 to 260 kb identified by Joslyn et al.
(1991) in patients with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC; 175100), Groden
et al. (1991) identified 3 genes in a span of about 100 kb on chromosome
5. One of these was DP1 (125265); a second was the gene that is mutant
in APC, called by them DP2.5 (611731). The third was a gene which was
found to have the same sequence as that of SRP19. Horii et al. (1993)
discussed the occurrence of alternative splicing not only within the APC
gene but also between the APC gene and the neighboring SRP19 gene.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Wild et al. (2001) reported the 1.8-angstrom resolution crystal
structure of human SRP19 in complex with its primary binding site on
helix 6 of SRP RNA, which consists of a stem-loop structure closed by an
unusual GGAG tetraloop. Protein-RNA interactions are mediated by the
specific recognition of a widened major groove and the tetraloop without
any direct protein-base contacts and include a complex network of highly
ordered water molecules. Wild et al. (2001) proposed a model of the
assembly of the SRP core comprising SRP19, SRP54, and SRP RNA based on
crystallographic and biochemical data.

Halic et al. (2004) presented the structure of a targeting complex
consisting of mammalian SRP bound to an active 80S ribosome carrying a
signal sequence. This structure, determined to 12-angstrom resolution by
cryoelectron microscopy, enabled Halic et al. (2004) to generate a
molecular model of SRP in its functional conformation. The model showed
how the S domain of SRP contacts the large ribosomal subunit at the
nascent chain exit site to bind the signal sequence, and that the Alu
domain reaches into the elongation factor-binding site of the ribosome,
explaining its elongation arrest activity.

MAPPING

The SRP19 gene maps to chromosome 5q21-q22, between the DP1 (125265) and
APC (611731) genes (Groden et al., 1991).

605219	TITLE *605219 DIRECT IAP-BINDING PROTEIN WITH LOW pI; DIABLO
;;SECOND MITOCHONDRIA-DERIVED ACTIVATOR OF CASPASE; SMAC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Caspase activation is a key regulatory step for apoptosis. Cytochrome c
(123970) released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space triggers 1
major caspase activation cascade. Upon its release to the cytosol,
cytochrome c binds to APAF1 (602233) in the presence of dATP or ATP. The
cytochrome c/APAF1 complex then recruits procaspase-9 (CASP9; 602234),
inducing its autoactivation and leading to the activation of downstream
caspases. Proteins of the BCL2 (see 603167) and inhibitor-of-apoptosis,
or IAP (see API3; 300079), families are major regulators of the
cytochrome c/APAF1/CASP9 pathway. SMAC promotes caspase activation in
this pathway.

CLONING

Du et al. (2000) identified and purified a protein, which they termed
SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase), that promotes
caspase activation in the cytochrome c/APAF1/CASP9 pathway. By
microsequence analysis, searching an EST database, and screening a HeLa
cell cDNA library, they isolated a cDNA encoding SMAC. The predicted
SMAC polypeptide contains 239 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.5-kb SMAC transcript in all tissues tested, with highest
expression in adult testis, high expression in heart, liver, kidney,
spleen, prostate, and ovary, and low expression in brain, lung, thymus,
and peripheral blood leukocytes.

Cheng et al. (2011) noted that the N-terminal 55 residues serve as a
mitochondrial-targeting sequence, which is removed after the Diablo
protein is imported into mitochondria intermembrane space. They found
broad expression of DIABLO in human embryonic tissue at 17 weeks'
gestation. The highest expression was in the testis, adrenal gland, and
ears, with moderate expression in the brain, eyes, liver, kidney, lung,
and spinal cord. Low expression was seen in the spleen. In the
developing mouse cochlea, Diablo was significantly upregulated in hair
cells from E18.5 to P0, but was subsequently downregulated. The extended
distribution of Diablo at different stages of development in the mouse
inner ear and the particular enrichment in hair cells suggested that
Diablo functions in the development and homeostasis of the inner ear and
in hair cells in particular.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cheng et al. (2011) noted that the DIABLO gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

Scott (2000) mapped the DIABLO gene to chromosome 12 based on sequence
similarity between the DIABLO sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF262240) and
the chromosome 12 clone RP11-512M8 (GenBank GENBANK AC048338).

Cheng et al. (2011) noted that the DIABLO gene maps to chromosome
12q24.31.

GENE FUNCTION

Du et al. (2000) showed that SMAC promotes CASP9 activation by binding
to IAPs and removing their inhibitory activity. SMAC is normally a
mitochondrial protein, but it is released into the cytosol when cells
undergo apoptosis. Mitochondrial import and cleavage of its signal
peptide are required for SMAC to gain its apoptotic activity.
Overexpression of SMAC increases cell sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli.
SMAC was the second mitochondrial protein identified (the first being
cytochrome c) that promotes apoptosis by activating caspases.

Verhagen et al. (2000) identified the murine homolog of SMAC, which they
called DIABLO (direct IAP-binding protein with low pI). They showed that
DIABLO can bind mammalian IAP homolog A (MIHA, or API3) and can also
interact with MIHB (API1; 601712), MIHC (API2; 601721), and OpIAP, the
baculoviral IAP. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis indicated
that the N-terminally processed, IAP-interacting form of DIABLO is
concentrated in membrane fractions in healthy cells but is released into
the MIHA-containing cytosolic fractions upon ultraviolet (UV)
irradiation. Since transfection of cells with DIABLO was able to counter
the protection afforded by MIHA against UV irradiation, the authors
suggested that DIABLO may promote apoptosis by binding to IAPs and
preventing them from inhibiting caspases.

Chai et al. (2000) showed that SMAC/DIABLO promotes not only the
proteolytic activation of procaspase-3, but also the enzymatic activity
of mature caspase-3, both of which depend upon its ability to interact
physically with IAPs.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can prevent colonic tumor
progression in both experimental animals and humans. Kohli et al. (2004)
found that NSAID-induced apoptosis in a human colorectal cancer cell
line was accompanied by release of SMAC from mitochondria into the
cytosol. When SMAC was disrupted by homologous recombination and RNA
interference, the NSAID-induced apoptosis was abrogated. SMAC release
was dependent on BAX (600040), since SMAC release was not found in BAX
knockout cells.

Burri et al. (2005) identified mouse Imp1 (IMMP1L; 612323) and Imp2
(IMMP2L; 605977) as the catalytic subunits of the mitochondrial inner
membrane peptidase (IMP) complex. Imp1 and Imp2 activated Diablo by
removing its presequence, resulting in sequestration of Diablo in the
intermembrane space prior to activation by an apoptotic signal.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Chai et al. (2000) determined the crystal structure of SMAC/DIABLO at
2.2-angstrom resolution, which revealed that it homodimerizes through an
extensive hydrophobic interface. Missense mutations inactivating this
dimeric interface significantly compromised the function of SMAC/DIABLO.
The N-terminal amino acids of SMAC/DIABLO are indispensable for its
function, and a 7-residue peptide derived from the N terminus promotes
procaspase-3 activation in vitro.

To understand the structural basis of molecular recognition between SMAC
and the IAPs, Liu et al. (2000) determined the solution structure of the
BIR3 domain of XIAP (300079) complexed with a functionally active
9-residue peptide derived from the N terminus of SMAC. Wu et al. (2000)
performed the same experiment. They found that the N-terminal 4 residues
(ala-val-pro-ile) in SMAC/DIABLO recognize a surface groove on BIR3,
with the first residue ala binding a hydrophobic pocket and making 5
hydrogen bonds to neighboring residues on BIR3. These observations
provided a structural explanation for the roles of the SMAC N terminus
as well as for the conserved N-terminal sequences in the Drosophila
proteins Hid/Grim/Reaper. In conjunction with other observations, Wu et
al. (2000) concluded that their results reveal how SMAC may relieve IAP
inhibition of caspase-9 activity. In addition to explaining a number of
biologic observations, both Liu et al. (2000) and Wu et al. (2000)
suggested that their structural analyses identified potential targets
for drug screening that may be used for the treatment of cancers that
overexpress IAPs.

XIAP interacts with caspase-9 and inhibits its activity, whereas SMAC
(also known as DIABLO) relieves this inhibition through interaction with
XIAP. Srinivasula et al. (2001) demonstrated that XIAP associates with
the active caspase-9-APAF1 holoenzyme complex through binding to the
amino terminus of the linker peptide on the small subunit of caspase-9,
which becomes exposed after proteolytic processing of procaspase-9 at
asp315. Supporting this observation, point mutations that abrogate the
proteolytic processing but not the catalytic activity of caspase-9, or
deletion of the linker peptide, prevented caspase-9 association with
XIAP and its concomitant inhibition. Srinivasula et al. (2001) noted
that the N-terminal 4 residues of caspase-9 linker peptide share
significant homology with the N-terminal tetrapeptide in mature SMAC and
in the Drosophila proteins Hid/Grim/Reaper, defining a conserved class
of IAP-binding motifs. Consistent with this finding, binding of the
caspase-9 linker peptide and SMAC to the BIR3 domain of XIAP is mutually
exclusive, suggesting that SMAC potentiates caspase-9 activity by
disrupting the interaction of the linker peptide of caspase-9 with BIR3.
Srinivasula et al. (2001) concluded that their studies reveal a
mechanism in which binding to the BIR3 domain of XIAP by 2 conserved
peptides, one from SMAC and the other from caspase-9, has opposing
effects on caspase activity and apoptosis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of a large Chinese family with young-adult onset of
autosomal dominant nonsyndromic deafness-64 (DFNA64; 614152), Cheng et
al. (2011) identified a heterozygous mutation in the DIABLO gene (S126L;
605219.0001). In vitro functional expression studies in E. coli and HeLa
cells showed that the mutant protein did not increase apoptotic activity
compared to wildtype. However, transfection of HeLa cells with the
mutant protein enhanced the degradation of mutant and wildtype DIABLO
via heterodimerization. Cells expressing the mutant protein showed
increased susceptibility to calcium-induced loss of mitochondrial
potential compared to wildtype, indicating increased sensitivity to
mitochondrial stress and suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction. A
decrease in wildtype protein did not yield similar findings, suggesting
that the existence of mutant DIABLO leads to activation of a degradation
machinery for constant clearance of aberrant proteins.

ANIMAL MODEL

Okada et al. (2002) generated Diablo-deficient mice by homologous
recombination. Western blot analysis confirmed the null mutation. The
mice were fertile and appeared grossly normal at more than 1 year of
age, and histologic analysis failed to detect any abnormalities. In
vitro analysis indicated an inhibition of procaspase-3 (CASP3; 600636)
cleavage in Diablo -/- cell lysates, but all types of Diablo -/- cells
tested responded normally to a number of apoptotic stimuli. Fas
(134637)-mediated apoptosis in liver was also normal in vivo in these
mice. The authors concluded that a redundant molecule, possibly Omi
(HTRA2; 606441), or molecules are capable of compensating for the loss
of Diablo function. Alternatively, they suggested that Diablo may only
regulate programmed cell death in specific situations or tissues not yet
identified.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 64
DIABLO, SER126LEU

In affected members of a large Chinese family with young-adult onset of
autosomal dominant nonsyndromic deafness-64 (DFNA64; 614152), Cheng et
al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 377C-T transition in exon 5 of the
DIABLO gene, resulting in a ser126-to-leu (S126L) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. The S126L mutation corresponds to a
ser71-to-leu (S71L) mutation in the mature protein. The mutation was not
found in 1,000 Chinese control chromosomes. In vitro functional
expression studies in E. coli and HeLa cells showed that the mutant
protein did not increase apoptotic activity compared to wildtype.
However, transfection of HeLa cells with the mutant protein enhanced the
degradation of mutant and wildtype DIABLO via heterodimerization. Cells
expressing the mutant protein showed increased susceptibility to
calcium-induced loss of mitochondrial potential compared to wildtype,
indicating increased sensitivity to mitochondrial stress and suggestive
of mitochondrial dysfunction. A decrease in wildtype protein did not
yield similar findings, suggesting that the existence of mutant DIABLO
leads to activation of a degradation machinery for constant clearance of
aberrant proteins.

605255	TITLE *605255 ETS VARIANT GENE 7; ETV7
;;ETS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TEL2; TEL2;;
TELB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family of transcription factors,
of which ETV7 is a member, is a large group of evolutionarily conserved
transcriptional regulators that play an important role in a variety of
cellular processes throughout development and differentiation, and are
involved in oncogenesis as well (Potter et al., 2000).

CLONING

Potter et al. (2000) sequenced cDNA clones corresponding to a novel ETS
gene from an activated T-cell cDNA library, as well as from breast
tissue and meningioma cDNA libraries. The cDNA, which the authors
designated TEL2, encodes a deduced 341-amino acid protein that shares
38% sequence identity with TEL1 (ETV6; 600618). TEL2 contains a
C-terminal ETS domain and an N-terminal PNT domain, which is thought to
mediate protein-protein interactions. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of TEL2 mRNA predominantly in hematopoietic tissues; a
predominant band of approximately 1.2 kb was present in fetal liver and
bone marrow and was faintly present in peripheral blood leukocytes.
Using antibodies raised against the C terminus of the TEL2 protein,
Potter et al. (2000) showed that TEL2 localizes to the nucleus. The
striking similarities of TEL2 to TEL1, its expression in hematopoietic
tissues, and its ability to associate with TEL1 suggested that TEL2 may
be an important hematopoietic regulatory protein.

Poirel et al. (2000) identified the TELB gene by comparison of the TEL
sequence with genomic sequence databases. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of TELB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Potter et al. (2000) determined that the TEL2 gene contains 8 exons
spanning approximately 21 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by inclusion within a PAC
clone, Potter et al. (2000) mapped the TEL2 gene to chromosome 6p21.

Poirel et al. (2000) mapped the TELB gene to 6p21 by genomic sequence
analysis.

609168	TITLE *609168 SHUGOSHIN-LIKE 1; SGOL1
;;SGO; SGO1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kitajima et al. (2004) cloned yeast Sgo1 and Sgo2, and by database
analysis, they identified 2 similar human proteins, SGOL1 and SGOL2
(612425), which they referred to as Q9BVA8 and tripin, respectively. All
Sgo-like proteins contain an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a
C-terminal basic region.

By searching for sequences similar to Xenopus Sgo, Salic et al. (2004)
identified mouse and human SGOL1, which they called SGO. The human
protein shares significant similarity with mouse and frog Sgo at the N-
and C-terminal ends.

Wang et al. (2008) noted that full-length SGO1 contains 527 amino acids.
An SGO1 splice variant lacking exon 6 encodes a 292-amino acid isoform
designated sSGO1. Using fluorescence microscopy, Wang et al. (2008)
showed that full-length SGO1 localized to kinetochores during mitosis.
In contrast, sSGO1 localized to centrosomes at interphase and to spindle
poles at mitosis, but not to kinetochores.

GENE FUNCTION

Salic et al. (2004) determined that the N terminus of mouse Sgo bound
and stabilized microtubules. Following transfection in HeLa cells,
epitope-tagged mouse Sgo localized to kinetochores between the fibrous
corona and the underlying centromeric chromatin, around the inner or
outer kinetochore plate. Endogenous HeLa cell SGOL1 was degraded by both
CDC20 (603618)- and CDH1 (603619)-activated anaphase-promoting complex
(APC), resulting in loss of SGOL1 from kinetochores during the
metaphase-to-anaphase transition. SGOL1 depletion by RNA interference
(RNAi) caused mitotic arrest with loss of sister kinetochore cohesion.
Chromosomes and their centromeres did not align to form a metaphase
plate; instead they scattered throughout the cell. SGOL1 depletion also
destabilized kinetochore microtubules. Salic et al. (2004) concluded
that SGOL1 is required for mitotic progression and chromosome
segregation and provides a link between sister centromere cohesion and
microtubule interactions at kinetochores.

Tang et al. (2004) found that depletion of BUB1 (602452) and SGO1 in
HeLa cells by RNAi caused massive missegregation of sister chromatids
that originated at centromeres. Loss of chromatid cohesion in BUB1 and
SGO1 RNAi cells did not appear to require activation of separase (see
604143), but instead triggered mitotic arrest dependent on MAD2 (601467)
and Aurora B (604970). Tang et al. (2004) determined that BUB1 maintains
the steady-state level and centromeric localization of SGO1, and they
concluded that BUB1 protects centromeric cohesion in mitosis through
SGO1.

Riedel et al. (2006) showed in both fission and budding yeast that Sgo1
recruited to centromeres a specific form of protein phosphatase-2A
(PP2A; 176915). Its inactivation caused loss of centromeric cohesin (see
RAD21; 606462) at anaphase I and random segregation of sister
centromeres at the second meiotic division. Artificial recruitment of
PP2A to chromosome arms prevented Rec8 (608193) phosphorylation and
hindered resolution of chiasmata. Riedel et al. (2006) concluded that
their data were consistent with the notion that efficient cleavage of
Rec8 requires phosphorylation of cohesin and that this is blocked by
PP2A at meiosis I centromeres.

In mitotic cells, phosphorylation of cohesin promotes its dissociation
from chromosomes, but centromeric cohesin is protected from
phosphorylation until kinetochores are properly captured by the spindle
microtubules. Kitajima et al. (2006) found that a shugoshin complex made
up of SGO1, SGO2, and a specific subtype of PP2A containing the
regulatory B56 subunit (see 601643) was required for protection of
centromeric cohesin in HeLa cells. The shugoshin-PP2A complex protected
cohesin by reversing phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit SA2 (STAG2;
300826). Both SGO1 and SGO2 bound PP2A directly, although SGO1 appeared
to bind the regulatory subunit PP2A-B56, while SGO2 appeared to bind the
core subunit PP2A-A (see 605983). Knockdown studies showed that SGO2
tethered PP2A to the centromere, whereas SGO1 had the more important
role in centromere protection and appeared to facilitate PP2A function
at centromeres.

Brar et al. (2006) showed that phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit
REC8 contributes to stepwise cohesin removal. Their data further
implicated 2 other key regulators of meiotic chromosome segregation, the
cohesin protector SGO1 and meiotic recombination in bringing about the
stepwise loss of cohesins and thus the establishment of the meiotic
chromosome segregation pattern.

Wang et al. (2008) found that SGO1 depletion via RNA interference
induced formation of multiple centrosome-like structures in mitotic HeLa
cells due to separation of paired centrioles. Sgo1 +/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts displayed split centrosomes. sSGO1 interacted with PLK1
(602098) in HeLa cells, and mutation of PLK1 phosphorylation sites in
sSGO1 (ser73 and thr146) resulted in mislocalization of sSGO1 from
mitotic spindle poles. Centriole splitting induced by SGO1 depletion or
expression of a dominant-negative mutant was suppressed by ectopic
expression of sSGO1 or by PLK1 knockdown. Wang et al. (2008) concluded
that sSGO1 plays an essential role in protecting centriole cohesion,
which is partly regulated by PLK1.

Yamagishi et al. (2008) showed that the requirement of heterochromatin
for mitotic chromosome segregation is largely replaced by forcibly
enriching cohesin at centromeres in fission yeast. However, this
enrichment of cohesin is not sufficient to replace the meiotic
requirement for heterochromatin. Yamagishi et al. (2008) found that the
heterochromatin protein Swi6 (whose human homolog is HP1, 604478)
associates directly with meiosis-specific shugoshin Sgo1, a protector of
cohesin at centromeres. A point mutation of Sgo1 (V243E), which
abolishes the interaction with Swi6, impairs the centromeric
localization and function of Sgo1. The forced centromeric localization
of Sgo1 restores proper meiotic chromosome segregation in swi6-delta
cells. Yamagishi et al. (2008) also showed that the direct link between
HP1 and shugoshin is conserved in human cells. Yamagishi et al. (2008)
suggested that the recruitment of shugoshin is the important primary
role for centromeric heterochromatin in ensuring eukaryotic chromosome
segregation.

Kawashima et al. (2010) demonstrated that BUB1 (602452) phosphorylates
the conserved ser121 of histone H2A in fission yeast S. pombe. The
h2a-SA mutant, in which all cellular H2A-S121 is replaced with alanine,
phenocopies the Bub1 kinase-dead mutant (bub1-KD) in losing the
centromeric localization of shugoshin proteins. Artificial tethering of
shugoshin to centromeres largely restores the h2a-SA or bub1-KD-related
chromatin instability defects, a function that is evolutionarily
conserved. Kawashima et al. (2010) concluded that Bub1 kinase creates a
mark for shugoshin localization and the correct partitioning of
chromosomes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2005) mapped the SGOL1 gene to chromosome 3p24.3 based on an
alignment of the SGOL1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF308299) with the
genomic sequence.

151990	TITLE *151990 LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-BINDING PROTEIN; LBP
;;LPS-BINDING PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein is an acute-phase reactant produced
during gram-negative bacterial infections. Higher eukaryotes have
evolved several mechanisms for protecting against such infections.
Gram-negative bacteria express lipopolysaccharide (LPS; endotoxin) on
their outer cell wall, and mammals respond rapidly to the presence of
LPS in serum. LBP and another acute-phase reactant, bactericidal
permeability-increasing protein (BPI; 109195), bind LPS with high
affinity. LBP is made in the liver during the acute phase of infections
and is thought to function as a carrier for LPS and to help control
LPS-dependent monocyte responses. See CD14 (158120) for information on
the receptor for the lipopolysaccharide binding
protein/lipopolysaccharide complex.

CLONING

By screening a human liver cDNA library with an oligonucleotide derived
from the rabbit LBP protein sequence, Schumann et al. (1990) isolated
cDNAs encoding LBP. The predicted human LBP protein consists of a
25-amino acid signal sequence followed by a 452-amino acid mature
protein containing 4 cysteine residues and 5 potential glycosylation
sites. Human LBP shares 69% amino acid identity with rabbit LBP, 44%
identity with human BPI, and 23% identity with human CETP (118470). In
rabbits, Schumann et al. (1990) found that LBP functions as a carrier
protein for LPS in plasma and controls LPS-dependent monocytic
responses.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hubacek et al. (1997) found that the LBP gene spans approximately 28.5
kb of DNA and contains 14 exons. Comparison of the genomic structures of
LBP, BPI, PLTP (172425), and CETP, which constitute a family of
functionally related proteins, revealed a remarkable conservation of
exon/intron junctions and exon size.

GENE FUNCTION

LPS interacts with LBP and CD14 to present LPS to TLR4 (603030), which
activates inflammatory gene expression through NF-kappa-B (see 164011)
and MAPK signaling. Bochkov et al. (2002) demonstrated that oxidized
phospholipids inhibit LPS-induced but not TNF-alpha (191160)-induced or
interleukin-1-beta (147720)-induced NF-kappa-B-mediated upregulation of
inflammatory genes by blocking the interaction of LPS with LBP and CD14.
Moreover, in LPS-injected mice, oxidized phospholipids inhibited
inflammation and protected mice from lethal endotoxin shock. Thus, in
severe gram-negative bacterial infection, endogenously formed oxidized
phospholipids may function as a negative feedback to blunt innate immune
responses. Furthermore, Bochkov et al. (2002) identified chemical
structures capable of inhibiting the effects of endotoxins such as LPS
that could be used for the development of new drugs for treatment of
sepsis.

Weber et al. (2003) found that LBP was present in the cerebrospinal
fluid of patients with pneumococcal meningitis. Injection of living
pneumococci or pneumococcal cell wall (PCW) into spinal canals of Lbp
+/- mice resulted in leukocyte influx and severe meningitis. In
contrast, injection into Lbp -/- mice produced no meningeal
inflammation. Lbp enhanced PCW-induced signaling and Tnf release in
rodent cell lines, and Lbp bound to PCW multimers independently of the
phosphorylcholine and teichoic acid components of PCW. Experiments using
human LBP suggested that the binding site for PCW may overlap with that
for LPS. Weber et al. (2003) concluded that LBP is also involved in
gram-positive infections.

MAPPING

In addition to the functional relationship and extensive structural
similarity between the LBP and BPI proteins, the LBP and BPI genes were
found by Southern blot analysis of human/mouse somatic cell hybrids and
by in situ hybridization to map to the same region of the genome:
20q11.23-q.12 (Gray et al., 1993).

ANIMAL MODEL

By using mice deficient in LBP through gene knockout experiments, Jack
et al. (1997) investigated how LBP functions in vivo. To their surprise,
they found that LBP is not required in vivo for the clearance of LPS
from the circulation, but is essential for the rapid induction of an
inflammatory response by small amounts of LPS or gram-negative bacteria
and for survival of an intraperitoneal Salmonella infection.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Autoantibodies to intracellular components can occur in patients with
autoimmune disease and occasionally in patients with other diseases. The
antibodies often recognize determinants corresponding to functional
sites. Using serum from a patient who progressed from liver cirrhosis to
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to screen a liver cell cDNA library, Imai
et al. (1993) isolated full-length cDNA clones encoding a nuclear
protein that they called HCC1. The HCC1 clones encode deduced proteins
of 530 amino acids (clone HCC1.4) and 524 amino acids (clone HCC1.3),
and the authors suggested that these represent splice variants. Sequence
analysis of HCC1 revealed the presence of 15 arginine-serine (RS)
motifs, characteristic of mRNA splicing factors (e.g., SFRS1; 600812).
Imai et al. (1993) also noted the presence of ribonucleoprotein
consensus sequences (see SNRPA; 182285) and a structural resemblance to
U2AF65 (191318). Western blot analysis showed expression of a 64-kD
cellular protein. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated the
presence of nuclear speckles that colocalized with SFRS2 (600813) and a
5-prime cap structure of U-snRNAs (e.g., RNU2; 180690). Northern blot
analysis detected 2 major HCC1 transcripts of 2.3 and 3.2 kb, as well as
2 minor transcripts of 4.3 and 5.0 kb, in human cancer cell lines and in
all normal tissues tested, with higher expression in pancreas, skeletal
muscle, lung, and brain, and lower expression in kidney, liver, and
heart.

Using ASC2 (NCOA6; 605299) as bait to screen a mouse liver cDNA library,
Jung et al. (2002) cloned Rnpc2, which they called Caper. The deduced
protein contains an N-terminal RS-rich domain, followed by 3 RNA
recognition motifs. An autonomous transactivation domain partly overlaps
RNA recognition motifs 2 and 3.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Jung et al. (2002) found that mouse Caper
specifically interacted with the AP1 component Jun (165160) and
estradiol-bound ligand-binding domains of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha
(ESR1; 133430) and ER-beta (ESR2; 601663), but not with any other
transcription factor tested. Binding to estradiol-bound ER activated the
cryptic autonomous transactivation function of Caper.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium assigned the HCC1
gene to chromosome 20 (TMAP sts-R02552).

613147	TITLE *613147 MICRO RNA 205; MIR205
;;miRNA205;;
MIRN205
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIR205, are small noncoding RNAs that
mediate posttranscriptional silencing by binding with partial
complementarity to the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs. miRNAs have
important roles in development and differentiation, cellular stress
responses, and cancer (summary by Yu et al., 2008).

GENE FUNCTION

Using the MDCK canine epithelial cell line and a subclone with a
mesenchymal phenotype, Gregory et al. (2008) found that the miR200
family of miRNAs (see 612090) and miR205 regulated expression of Zeb1
(189909) and Zeb2 (605802) and controlled epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition. Furthermore, expression of the miR200 family and miR205 was
lost in invasive human breast cancer cell lines with mesenchymal
phenotype and in primary breast cancer specimens lacking E-cadherin
(CDH1; 192090), an epithelial cell marker.

Using human epithelial cell lines and primary human corneal and
epidermal keratinocytes, Yu et al. (2008) identified SHIP2 (INPPL1;
600829), a lipid phosphatase that functions in the AKT (see 164730)
signaling pathway, as a target of MIR205. They also showed that MIR184
(613146) interfered with the ability of MIR205 to downregulate
expression of SHIP2. A synthetic antagomir targeting MIR205 or ectopic
expression of MIR184 induced SHIP2 expression in keratinocytes, with
coordinated damping of AKT signaling and increased apoptosis.
Examination of the 3-prime UTR of SHIP2 revealed overlapping binding
sites for MIR184 and MIR205. Coexpression of MIR184 with MIR205 reversed
MIR205-induced inhibition of a reporter gene containing the SHIP2
3-prime UTR. MIR184 had no direct effect on SHIP2 expression, but
instead interfered with MIR205 binding to the 3-prime UTR of SHIP2.

MAPPING

Gross (2009) mapped the MIR205 gene to chromosome 1q32.2 based on an
alignment of the mature MIR205 sequence (UCCUUCAUUCCACCGGAGUCUG) with
the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

601743	TITLE *601743 ONCOSTATIN M RECEPTOR; OSMR
;;ONCOSTATIN M-SPECIFIC RECEPTOR, BETA; OSMRB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Oncostatin M (OSM; 165095) is a member of the IL6 (147620) family of
cytokines. Functional receptors for IL6 family cytokines are
multisubunit complexes involving members of the hematopoietin receptor
superfamily. Many IL6 cytokines utilize gp130 (IL6ST; 600694) as a
common receptor subunit. OSM binds to the gp130 receptor subunit and, in
association with leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR; 151443),
induces a proliferative response in permissive cells. Mosley et al.
(1996) used degenerate PCR to clone a novel hematopoietin receptor which
they called the oncostatin M-specific receptor beta subunit (OSMR-beta).
Sequencing revealed that this gene encodes a 979-amino acid protein
containing characteristic motifs of the hematopoietin receptor family.

GENE FUNCTION

Mosley et al. (1996) found that IL3 (147740)-dependent murine pre-B
cells coexpressing gp130 and OSMR-beta showed a proliferative response
after OSM stimulation, but they showed no response to LIF.

Dillon et al. (2004) demonstrated that OSMR and IL31RA (609510) form the
heterodimeric receptor through which IL31 (609509) signals. Expression
of IL31RA and OSMR mRNA was induced in activated monocytes, and both
mRNAs were constitutively expressed in epithelial cells Expression of
IL31RA was upregulated in monocytes after stimulation with IFNG
(147570), and OSMR expression was upregulated with lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) treatment. Treatment with LPS plus IFNG upregulated both
receptors.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By candidate gene analysis in a 5p13.1-q11.2 region of linkage
identified in families with primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis
(PLCA1; 105250), Arita et al. (2008) identified missense mutations in
the OSMR gene in 3 families (601743.0001-601743.0002). OSMR-beta is a
component of the oncostatin-M (OSM; 165095) type II receptor and the
interleukin-31 receptor (IL31RA; 609510). Arita et al. (2008) found that
PLCA keratinocytes showed reduced activation of Jak/Stat, MAPK, and
p13K/Akt pathways after OSM or IL31 cytokine stimulation. The 2
pathogenic amino acid substitutions found by Arita et al. (2008) were
located within the extracellular fibronectin type III-like (FnIII)
domains, regions critical for receptor dimerization and function.
Oncostatin M (OSM; 165095) and IL31 (609509) have been implicated in
keratinocyte cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and
inflammation. Arita et al. (2008) pointed to this as the first
demonstration of human germline mutations in this cytokine receptor
complex and suggested that it provides new insight into mechanisms of
skin itching.

By whole-exome sequencing of the OSMR gene in Taiwanese patients with
PLCA mapping to chromosome 5, Lin et al. (2010) identified 3 novel
heterozygous mutations (601743.0003-601743.0005). In 1 Taiwanese family
they identified a heterozygous mutation in the IL31RA gene
(609510.0001), which occurred in a fnIII domain as observed in the OSMR
mutations.

;;TONICITY-RESPONSIVE ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN; TONEBP;;
NFAT-LIKE PROTEIN 1; NFATL1;;
KIAA0827
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tonicity-responsive enhancers (TonEs) in kidney medulla cells play a key
role in hypertonicity-induced transcriptional stimulation of
sodium/myoinositol cotransporter (SLC5A3; 600444),
sodium/chloride/betaine cotransporter (SLC6A12; 603080), and aldose
reductase (AKR1B1; 103880). Using a yeast 1-hybrid strategy followed by
screening of a HeLa cDNA library, Miyakawa et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA
encoding NFAT5, which they called TONEBP (TonE-binding protein). By
searching an EST database for sequences related to NFATC family members
(e.g., NFATC1; 600489), Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (1999) also isolated a
cDNA encoding NFAT5. The 1,455-amino acid NFAT5 protein contains a
region near the N terminus that has high homology to the Rel-like
DNA-binding domain of the NFATC family. However, NFAT5 lacks the
N-terminal sequence that functions as an interface for calcineurin (see
114105) and regulatory kinases. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 13-kb NFAT5 transcript that was ubiquitously expressed. By
electrophoretic mobility shift analyses, Miyakawa et al. (1999) showed
that the NFAT5 Rel region binds to TonE DNA, and Lopez-Rodriguez et al.
(1999) showed that it binds to sequences similar to those preferred by
NFATC1, but not to FOS (164810) or JUN (165160). Western blot analysis
detected expression of a 200-kD NFAT5 protein in a kidney cell line
(Lopez-Rodriguez et al., 1999). By immunostaining, Miyakawa et al.
(1999) showed that NFAT5 is present in both cytoplasm and nucleus of
isotonic kidney cells, but is found predominantly in the nucleus of
cells cultured in hypertonic medium; Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (1999)
detected staining only in the nucleus of resting and stimulated T
lymphocytes, HeLa cells, and myoblast cells.

By Western blot analysis of mouse tissue, Trama et al. (2000) detected
abundant expression of NFAT5, which they termed NFATL1, in thymus, with
much lower amounts in testis, lung, and brain, and no expression in
other tissues, including lymph nodes. Stimulated mouse splenocytes
expressed NFAT5, whereas quiescent mouse splenocytes and T cells exposed
to cyclosporin A or FK506 did not. Reporter gene analysis showed that
T-cell receptor cross-linking resulted in the induction of NFAT5 in
human Jurkat cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Jauliac et al. (2002) found that both NFATC2 (600490) and NFAT5 were
expressed in invasive human ductal breast carcinomas. Using cell lines
derived from breast and colon carcinomas, they found that these NFATs
promoted carcinoma invasion and that their activity correlated with
expression of alpha-6 (147556)/beta-4 (147557) integrin. The
transcriptional activity of NFAT5 was induced by alpha-6/beta-4
clustering in the presence of chemoattractants, resulting in enhanced
cell migration. Jauliac et al. (2002) determined that the activity of
NFAT5 required an intact beta-4 cytoplasmic tail.

In studies in rats, Machnik et al. (2009) demonstrated that TONEBP-VEGFC
(601528) signaling in mononuclear phagocytes is a major determinant of
extracellular volume and blood pressure homeostasis, and is intimately
involved in salt-induced hypertension (see 145500).

Kleinewietfeld et al. (2013) demonstrated that increased salt
concentrations found locally under physiologic conditions in vivo
markedly boost the induction of murine and human T(H)17 cells. High-salt
conditions activated the p38/MAPK (600289) pathway involving NFAT5 and
serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (SGK1; 602958) during
cytokine-induced T(H)17 polarization. Gene silencing or chemical
inhibition of p38/MAPK, NFAT5, or SGK1 abrogated the high-salt-induced
T(H)17 cell development. The T(H)17 cells generated under high-salt
conditions displayed a highly pathogenic and stable phenotype
characterized by the upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines GMCSF
(138960), TNF-alpha (191160), and IL2 (147680). Moreover, mice fed with
a high-salt diet developed a more severe form of autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), in line with augmented central nervous system
infiltrating and peripherally induced antigen-specific T(H)17 cells.
Thus, Kleinewietfeld et al. (2013) suggested that increased dietary salt
intake might represent an environmental risk factor for the development
of autoimmune diseases through the induction of pathogenic T(H)17 cells.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the NFAT5
gene, which they called KIAA0827, to chromosome 16. Hebinck et al.
(2000) mapped the NFAT5 gene to chromosome 16q22.1 by FISH and radiation
hybrid analysis. Using the latter method, they mapped the mouse homolog
to chromosome 8D.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (2004) found that homozygous Nfat5-deficient mice
were genetically underrepresented after embryonic day 14.5. Surviving
mice manifested a progressive and profound atrophy of the kidney medulla
with impaired activation of several osmoprotective genes, including
Akr1b1, Slc6a12, and Slc5a3. The Akr1b1 gene is controlled by a
tonicity-responsive enhancer, which was refractory to hypertonic stress
in fibroblasts lacking Nfat5, establishing this enhancer as a direct
transcriptional target of NFAT5. Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (2004) concluded
that NFAT5 is a tonicity-responsive transcription factor with a central
role in kidney homeostasis and function.

611859	TITLE *611859 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L55; MRPL55
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL55
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl55 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL55. They also identified MRPL55 homologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast, E. coli, or Arabidopsis.
Mouse and human MRPL55 share 71.7% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MRPL55 gene to chromosome 1q42.13 based on an
alignment of the MRPL55 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY358771) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

;;NPH2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mammalian neurexophilin was discovered as a 29-kD neuronal glycoprotein
that copurifies in a tight complex with neurexin I-alpha (600565)
(Petrenko et al., 1996). By searching sequence databases using the amino
acid sequence of mammalian neurexophilin as the query, Missler and
Sudhof (1998) identified human ESTs corresponding to neurexophilins-1
(NXPH1; 604639), -2 (NXPH2), -3 (NXPH3; 604636), and -4 (NXPH4; 604637).
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of human, rat, mouse, and bovine
neurexophilins revealed that neurexophilins share a common predicted
structure composed of 5 domains: an N-terminal signal peptide, a
variable N-terminal domain, a highly conserved central domain that is
N-glycosylated, a short linker region, and a conserved C-terminal domain
that is cysteine-rich. Northern blot analysis of a variety of human
tissues detected NXPH2 expression in brain and kidney. Missler and
Sudhof (1998) concluded that neurexophilins form a family of related
glycoproteins that are proteolytically processed after synthesis. They
suggested that neurexophilins are signaling molecules that resemble
neuropeptides and that act by binding to alpha-neurexins and possibly
other receptors.

604417	TITLE *604417 AF4/FMR2 FAMILY, MEMBER 4; AFF4
;;ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 5q31; AF5Q31
DESCRIPTION Infantile acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with rearrangements of the
MLL gene (159555) is characterized by early pre-B phenotype and poor
treatment outcome. Taki et al. (1999) studied a 4-month-old girl with
the diagnosis of ALL. Leukemic cells were characterized cytogenetically
as ins(5;11)(q31;q13q23), i(17q). By molecular studies, Taki et al.
(1999) identified a gene on 5q31 as a fusion partner of the MLL gene.
The AF5q31 gene (GenBank GENBANK AF197927), so termed for 'ALL1-fused
gene partner from 5q31,' encodes a protein of 1,163 amino acids, is
located in the vicinity of the cytokine cluster region of 5q31, and
contains at least 16 exons. The AF5q31 gene was expressed in fetal
heart, lung, and brain at relatively high levels and in fetal liver at a
low level, but the expression in these tissues was decreased in adults.
The AF5q31 protein was homologous to AF4-related proteins, including AF4
(159557), LAF4 (601464), and FMR2 (309548). The AF5q31 and AF4 proteins
had 3 homologous regions, including the transactivation domain of AF4,
and the breakpoint of AF5q31 was located within the region homologous to
the transactivation domain of AF4. Furthermore, the clinical features of
the patient with the MLL-AF5q31 fusion transcript, characterized by the
early pre-B phenotype and poor outcome, were similar to those of
patients having MLL-AF4 chimeric transcripts. Taki et al. (1999)
suggested that these findings may indicate that AF5q31 and AF4 defines a
new family particularly involved in the pathogenesis of 11q23-associated
ALL.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) obtained a partial BIRC6 clone, which they
designated KIAA1289. The deduced 1,592-amino acid peptide shares a high
degree of similarity with a mouse ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme of over
4,800 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected low expression in several
tissues and specific adult brain regions, but not in adult pancreas and
spleen or fetal brain.

Conserved genes that encode inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are
frequently overexpressed in human cancers and are associated with
resistance to therapy. IAPs contain a 70-amino acid cysteine- and
histidine-rich baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) and often a zinc-binding
RING finger. Using PCR with degenerate primers from BIR domains and a
testis cDNA library, Chen et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding a novel
IAP, BIRC6, which they termed Apollon. The deduced 4,830-amino acid
protein is 92% identical to mouse Bruce and 42% identical in the BIR
region to survivin (BIRC5; 603352). Northern blot analysis revealed
ubiquitous expression of a 15-kb transcript. Of 38 human cancer cell
lines examined by Western blot analysis, BIRC6 was expressed as a 530-kD
protein in 4 of 6 brain cancers (gliomas) and 1 of 5 ovarian cancers.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (1999) found that some brain cancer cell lines with high
expression of BIRC6 exhibited resistance to apoptosis in the presence of
anticancer drugs. Treatment of a high expressing cell line with BIRC6
antisense oligonucleotides reduced BIRC6 expression and reversed the
resistance to anticancer drugs.

Hao et al. (2004) found that cells transfected with human Apollon
resisted cell death induced by transient expression of CASP9 (602234)
and CASP8 (601763), and overexpressing cells resisted cell death induced
by antitumor drugs or death-receptor ligation. Caspase activation by
etoposide, an anticancer drug, was suppressed in cells overexpressing
Apollon. Hao et al. (2004) showed that Apollon bound SMAC (605219),
HTRA2 (606441), and CASP9. They determined that the conserved N-terminal
BIR domain of Apollon bound both SMAC and CASP9, and the N-terminal
IAP-binding motif of SMAC bound Apollon. Apollon functioned as an E2
ubiquitin in polyubiquitinating SMAC and CASP9, which facilitated their
degradation. Mutation analysis indicated that cys327 of Apollon was
required to bind Apollon to SMAC and CASP9, and cys4638 within the UBC
domain of Apollon was critical for its polyubiquitinating activity.

Qiu et al. (2004) found that BRUCE was bound by the C-terminal half of
NRDP1 (RNF41), a ubiquitin ligase that promotes protein ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation. NRDP1 catalyzed ubiquitination and
proteasomal degradation of BRUCE and promoted apoptosis in response to
apoptotic stimuli in several human cell lines. Decreasing BRUCE content
by RNA interference induced apoptosis. Qiu et al. (2004) concluded that
BRUCE is essential for cell viability.

Pohl and Jentsch (2008) showed that BRUCE was involved in cytokinesis
and abscission in several human cell lines. BRUCE localized to the
midbody ring during cytokinesis, where it bound mitotic regulators and
components of the vesicle targeting machinery. Microscopic studies and
live-cell imaging revealed that BRUCE was involved in the correct
delivery of membrane vesicles to the site of abscission and for the
integrity of the midbody, in particular the midbody ring. BRUCE also
directed relocalization of ubiquitin from the midbody to the midbody
ring. Localization of BRUCE to the midbody ring depended on MKLP1
(KIF23; 605064), a mitotic kinesin essential for the formation of the
midbody matrix. Both BRUCE and MKLP1 were ubiquitinated, and UBPY (USP8;
603158) served as their deubiquitinating enzyme. Pohl and Jentsch (2008)
proposed that BRUCE coordinates multiple steps required for abscission
and that ubiquitination may be a crucial trigger.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the BIRC6 gene
to chromosome 2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hao et al. (2004) found that targeted disruption of the Apollon gene in
mice caused embryonic and neonatal lethality. At embryonic day 15.5,
more than half of the mutant embryos had severely defective angiogenesis
that often coincided with severe edema. At embryonic day 18.5, mutant
embryos were significantly smaller than control littermates, their liver
weight was reduced, and they had a reduced number of hepatocytes, but
they showed no signs of enhanced apoptosis. The growth rate of primary
cultured mutant embryonic fibroblasts was slower than that of controls.
The number of cells in S and G2/M phase was reduced, and the number in
G1 phase was increased. SMAC induced apoptosis in Apollon-deficient
fibroblasts, but not in Apollon-expressing cells. The IAP-binding motif
of SMAC was required to induce apoptosis in Apollon-deficient cells. Hao
et al. (2004) concluded that the interaction between Apollon and SMAC is
essential in preventing SMAC-induced apoptosis.

Lotz et al. (2004) found that the perinatal lethality and growth
retardation of embryonic day-14 Bruce-deficient mice was linked to
impaired placental development. Chorioallontoic placentation initiated
normally, but the mutant placenta showed an impaired maturation of the
labyrinth layer and significant reduction of the spongiotrophoblast.
Lotz et al. (2004) noted no evidence for elevated apoptosis in embryonic
and extraembryonic tissues or in knockout fibroblasts.
