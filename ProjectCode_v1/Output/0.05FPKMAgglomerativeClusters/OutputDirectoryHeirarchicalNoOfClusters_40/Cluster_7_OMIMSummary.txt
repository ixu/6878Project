;;CHROMOSOME 10 OPEN READING FRAME 59; C10ORF59
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Renalase is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent amine oxidase that
is secreted into the blood from the kidney (Xu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for transcripts likely to encode proteins
secreted from the kidney, Xu et al. (2005) identified a cDNA clone
encoding renalase. The deduced 342-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 37.8 kD. Renalase contains an N-terminal signal
sequence and an amino oxidase domain. Northern blot analysis of several
tissues detected robust expression of a 1.5-kb transcript in kidney, and
lower expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. A minor
transcript of about 2.4 kb was detected in skeletal muscle, and a minor
transcript of 1.2 kb was detected in kidney and liver. In situ
hybridization detected renalase in renal glomeruli and proximal tubules,
and in cardiomyocytes. Western blot analysis detected renalase at an
apparent molecular mass of about 35 kD in human urine. There was also a
signal at 67 to 75 kD, suggesting that the protein may form a doublet.
Renalase was also detected in the plasma of healthy individuals, but not
in the plasma of patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (2005) demonstrated that epitope-tagged renalase was secreted
from transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Purified and recombinant
renalase metabolized catecholamines, with dopamine as the preferred
substrate, followed by epinephrine and norepinephrine. Within 30 seconds
of a single bolus injection of recombinant renalase into rats, systolic,
diastolic, and mean arterial pressure were decreased in a dose-dependent
manner. Renalase also decreased cardiac contractility and heart rate,
but peripheral vascular resistance was unchanged.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (2005) determined that the renalase gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 311 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Xu et al. (2005) mapped the RNLS gene to
chromosome 10q23.33.

611477	TITLE *611477 RNA POLYMERASE II-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; RPAP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Jeronimo et al. (2007) identified RPAP3 as an RNA polymerase II (see
180660)-associated protein in HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells and
obtained a full-length RPAP3 cDNA by database and sequence analyses. The
deduced 665-amino acid protein contains 2 helix-turn-helix
tetratricopeptide repeats characteristic of chaperone cofactors.

GENE FUNCTION

Using affinity purification, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic
analysis, Jeronimo et al. (2007) mapped an interaction network of
protein complexes involved in the RNA polymerase II machinery. They
found that RPAP1 (611475), RPAP2 (611476), RPAP3, and XAB1 (611479) were
tightly bound to RNA polymerase II in the soluble nuclear compartment in
HEK293 cells, and gel filtration with epitope-tagged POLR2J (604150)
confirmed that RPAP1, RPAP3, and XAB1 cofractionated with RNA polymerase
II. Examination of the protein interaction network revealed that the
RPAPs and XAB1 also interacted with components of the Mediator (e.g.,
MED17; 603810) and Integrator (e.g., INTS3; 611347) complexes, as well
as with proteins able to assemble into molecular chaperone complexes,
including the prefoldins (e.g., PFDN6; 605660) and the AAA+ ATPases
RUVBL1 (603449) and RUVBL2 (604788).

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the RPAP3 gene to chromosome 12q13.11 based on an
alignment of the RPAP3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025561) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

606818	TITLE *606818 DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE III; DPP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DPP3 (EC 3.4.14.4) is one of the dipeptidyl aminopeptidases that remove
N-terminal dipeptides from physiologically active peptides such as
angiotensin (see 106150) or enkephalin (131330).

CLONING

Fukasawa et al. (1999) isolated a partial DPP3 cDNA clone from a
placenta cDNA library, using antibody to the purified protein as probe.
By mass spectrometry, Abramic et al. (2000) determined that the
molecular mass of full-length DPP3 is 82.5 kD; by SDS-PAGE, the apparent
molecular mass is 81.2 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation and enzyme analysis of the rat recombinant DPP3 protein,
Fukasawa et al. (1999) found that DPP3 shows zinc-dependent
metalloprotease activity and contains a conserved HELLGH motif with
similarity to the zincin HExxH consensus motif. Abramic et al. (2000)
noted that whereas the enzymes purified from rat and human erythrocytes
show the same molecular mass, pI, and enzyme substrates, they differ
significantly in their temperature stability, pH optima, kinetic
parameters, and sensitivity to divalent cations, sulfhydryl reagents,
and microbial protease inhibitors.

MAPPING

Fukasawa et al. (2000) mapped the DPP3 gene to chromosome 11q12-q13.1 by
FISH.

607560	TITLE *607560 RHO GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 2; ARHGEF2
;;GEFH1;;
KIAA0651
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Rho (see RhoA; 165390)-related small GTPases are involved in regulating
signal transduction cascades from extracellular stimuli to the cell
nucleus and cytoskeleton. DBL (311030)-like guanine nucleotide exchange
factors (GEFs), such as ARHGEF2, catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for
GTP on Rho-related proteins.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned ARHGEF2, which they designated
KIAA0651. The deduced protein contains 910 amino acids. RT-PCR detected
expression of ARHGEF2 in all tissues examined.

Reddy et al. (1989) identified a partial clone of ARHGEF2 as a regulator
of proliferation in Hep-2 cells. By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library
with this clone, followed by 5-prime RACE, Ren et al. (1998) obtained a
full-length cDNA encoding ARHGEF2, which they designated GEFH1. The
deduced protein contains 894 amino acids and has a calculated molecular
mass of 100 kD. ARHGEF2 has an N-terminal zinc finger-like motif,
followed by a DBL homology domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a
C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb
transcript in all tissues tested, with highest expression in thymus,
testis, and leukocytes.

Krendel et al. (2002) determined that the full-length ARHGEF2 protein
contains 985 amino acids. They concluded that KIAA0651 likely represents
a splice variant that differs from the full-length sequence by the
absence of the N-terminal zinc finger motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Ren et al. (1998) determined that recombinant GEFH1 could stimulate the
dissociation of radiolabeled GDP from RhoA. By screening a panel of
small G proteins, they found that GEFH1 was a GEF for RhoA, RhoB
(165370), RhoC (165380), and RAC1 (602048). Further characterization
revealed that GEFH1 bound Rho and Rac when these G proteins were in
either the GDP- or GTP-bound state. GEFH1 transfected into COS-7 or NIH
3T3 cells showed a filamentous distribution that colocalized with
tubulin (see 191130). Mutation of the C-terminal coiled-coil region
caused redistribution of GEFH1 to a cytoplasmic punctate distribution.
Overexpression of GEFH1 in COS-7 cells resulted in induction of large
membrane ruffles, similar to the effect observed when a constitutively
active form of Rac was expressed.

Krendel et al. (2002) determined that KIAA0651, a splice variant of
GEFH1 lacking the N-terminal zinc finger motif, did not localize to
microtubules. The full-length protein containing a point mutation (cys53
to arg) in the zinc finger, as well as N- and C-terminally truncated
GEFH1 proteins, also lost microtubule localization. However, none of
these variants affected microtubule stability. These variants did,
however, show higher GEF activity than the microtubule-bound forms, and
they induced Rho-dependent changes in cell morphology and actin
organization. Krendel et al. (2002) concluded that both the N- and
C-terminal motifs mediate microtubule localization of GEFH1, and that
GEFH1 links changes in microtubule integrity to Rho-dependent regulation
of the actin cytoskeleton.

Zenke et al. (2004) identified a region in the C terminus of GEFH1 that
is important for the suppression of its guanine nucleotide exchange
activity by microtubules. This region has a coiled-coil motif, a
proline-rich motif that may interact with SH3 domain-containing
proteins, and a potential binding site for 14-3-3 proteins (see YWHAH;
113508). Zenke et al. (2004) also showed that ser885 within the
14-3-3-binding site is a phosphorylation site for PAK1 (602590), an
effector of RAC and CDC42 (116952) GTPases. PAK1 phosphorylation of
GEFH1 at ser885 induced the docking of 14-3-3 to GEFH1 and the
relocation of 14-3-3 to microtubules. Zenke et al. (2004) concluded that
PAK and 14-3-3 are involved in the regulation of GEFH1 activity and that
phosphorylation of GEFH1 by PAK may coordinate RAC/CDC42- and
Rho-dependent signaling pathways.

RhoA is downregulated when epithelial cells reach confluence, resulting
in inhibition of signaling pathways that stimulate proliferation. By
coimmunoprecipitation, Aijaz et al. (2005) found that endogenous Gefh1
interacted with cingulin, a tight junction adaptor protein, in
Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Cingulin binding inhibited RhoA
activation and signaling, suggesting that the increase in cingulin
expression in confluent cells inhibits Gefh1 and thereby downregulates
RhoA. In agreement, RNA interference of Gefh1 or transfection of a
mutant Gefh1 unable to bind cingulin inhibited G1/S phase transition in
MDCK cells. Depletion of cingulin by regulated RNA interference resulted
in RhoA activation and the development of irregular cell monolayers.
Aijaz et al. (2005) concluded that the formation of epithelial tight
junctions contributes to the downregulation of RhoA by inactivating
Gefh1 in a cingulin-dependent manner.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the ARHGEF2
gene to chromosome 1.

602940	TITLE *602940 MARCKS-LIKE PROTEIN 1; MARCKSL1
;;MLP;;
MARCKS-RELATED PROTEIN; MRP;;
MAC-MARCKS;;
F52
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Umekage and Kato (1991) identified a cDNA with homology to MARCKS
(PKCSL; 177061) among mouse brain cDNAs with specific brain expression
patterns. The myristoylated, alanine-rich protein MARCKS is a widely
expressed, prominent substrate for protein kinase C (see 176960), a key
enzyme of intracellular signal transduction. The predicted 200-amino
acid protein, which they called F52, shares 52% amino acid identity with
bovine MARCKS. The similarity between the 2 proteins is found in the
consensus myristoylation sequence near the N-terminus and in the
25-amino acid protein kinase C phosphorylation site domain. F52 has a
similar amino acid composition to MARCKS, although its alanine content
is not as high. It is distributed throughout the mouse brain in a
pattern that is distinct from that of MARCKS.

By screening a genomic library with portions of the Mrp cDNA, Stumpo et
al. (1998) isolated the human homolog, which they designated MLP for
'MARCKS-like protein.' They reported that the sequences of the mouse and
human promoters were 71% identical over 433 bp. A transgene containing
this 433-bp fragment from mouse linked to a reporter Mrp
beta-galactosidase gene produced normal patterns of Mrp expression in
the developing mouse embryo.

Using Northern hybridization, Lobach et al. (1993) observed Mrp
expression in various mouse tissues, with highest levels in testis and
uterus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lobach et al. (1993) reported that the mouse F52, or Mrp, gene contains
a single intron at a position exactly analogous to that of the single
intron in mouse, cow, and human MARCKS.

MAPPING

By analysis of an interspecific backcross, Lobach et al. (1993) mapped
the Mrp gene to a position on mouse chromosome 4 that was closely linked
to the Lck (153390) locus. Based on homology of synteny, they predicted
that the human homolog would map to chromosome 1p35-p32. Using somatic
cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Stumpo et
al. (1998) confirmed that the human MLP gene maps to 1p34.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wu et al. (1996) used gene targeting to generate Mrp-deficient mice.
They observed severe neural tube defects (NTD) including exencephaly,
spina bifida, and tail flexion anomaly in approximately 60% of the
homozygous mutants and in approximately 10% of heterozygous animals. The
homozygous mutants without exencephaly survived despite brain
abnormalities, which appear to occur secondarily to the NTD. Wu et al.
(1996) suggested that mutations in Mrp result in isolated NTD and
therefore may provide an animal model for common human NTD.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned ATG14, which they designated
KIAA0831. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in both
its 3- and 5-prime ends, and the deduced protein contains 379 amino
acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest ATG14 expression in brain, lower
expression in kidney and ovary, and little to no expression in other
human tissues examined.

Using mass spectrometry to identify proteins that immunoprecipitated
with beclin-1 (BECN1; 604378) from a human breast epithelial cell line,
followed by database analysis and RT-PCR of human embryonic kidney
cells, Matsunaga et al. (2009) cloned ATG14, which they called ATG14L.
The deduced 492-amino acid protein contains 3 coiled-coil domains in its
N-terminal half. Database analysis revealed close orthologs in
vertebrates only. Immunofluorescence analysis and immunoelectron
microscopy showed that ATG14L localized to autophagosomes, isolation
membranes of forming autophagosomes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and a
punctate structure. ATG14L had an apparent molecular mass of 55.3 kD by
SDS-PAGE.

Zhong et al. (2009) cloned mouse Atg14. The deduced 492-amino acid
protein has a conserved structural maintenance of chromosomes motif that
includes 2 coiled-coil domains. Western blot analysis showed that Atg14
had an apparent molecular mass of about 60 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using epitope-tagged human beclin-1 for affinity purification, followed
by mass spectroscopy, Matsunaga et al. (2009) showed that beclin-1
interacted with ATG14L, UVRAG (602493), Rubicon (KIAA0226; 613516),
VPS34 (PIK3C3; 602609), and VPS15 (PIK3R4; 602610) in MCF7 breast cancer
cells. Using antibodies directed to individual proteins, they found that
beclin-1, VPS34, and VPS15 were present within 3 distinct complexes: a
complex containing ATG14L, a complex containing UVRAG, and a complex
containing both UVRAG and Rubicon. Yeast 2-hybrid and deletion analyses
revealed that the coiled-coil regions of ATG14L and UVRAG interacted
directly with the coiled-coil region of beclin-1 in a mutually exclusive
manner. Knockdown of ATG14L via short hairpin RNA interfered with
starvation-induced formation of autophagosomes in human A549 lung
epithelia cells. Knockout of Atg14l in mouse embryonic stem cells
resulted in defective basal autophagy and starvation-induced autophagy.
Matsunaga et al. (2009) concluded that ATG14L is essential for the
initiation of autophagosome formation.

Zhong et al. (2009) found that mouse Atg14 coimmunoprecipitated with
endogenous beclin-1 and Vps34, which are essential components of a
protein complex that regulates autophagy. Mutation analysis revealed
that both coiled-coil domains of Atg14 were required for the interaction
of Atg14 with beclin-1 and Vps34. Gel filtration experiments revealed
that endogenous Vps34, beclin-1, Atg14, and Rubicon coeluted in a
complex of over 700 kD. However, immunoprecipitation analysis showed
that Atg14 and Rubicon did not always coimmunoprecipitate in the same
complex. Knockdown of Atg14 or beclin-1 via small interfering RNA
impaired autophagy-mediated clearance of a test substrate. Knockdown of
Atg14 in mouse fibroblasts resulted in accumulation of large puncta
representing ubiquitinated protein inclusions and reduced the number of
autophagosomes. Atg14 also stimulated Vps34 kinase activity, but only
when coexpressed with beclin-1.

Hamasaki et al. (2013) demonstrated that autophagosomes form at the
ER-mitochondria contact site in mammalian cells. Imaging data revealed
that the preautophagosome/autophagosome marker ATG14 relocalizes to the
ER-mitochondria contact site after starvation, and the
autophagosome-formation marker ATG5 (604261) also localizes at the site
until formation is complete. Subcellular fractionation showed that ATG14
cofractionates in the mitochondria-associated ER membrane fraction under
starvation conditions. Disruption of the ER-mitochondria contact site
prevents the formation of ATG14 puncta. The ER-resident SNARE protein
syntaxin-17 (STX17; 604204) binds ATG14 and recruits it to the
ER-mitochondria contact site. Hamasaki et al. (2013) concluded that
their results provided insight into organelle biogenesis by
demonstrating that the ER-mitochondria contact site is important in
autophagosome formation.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the ATG14 gene
to chromosome 14.

;;PDZ-RHOGEF;;
GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER EAAT4-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 48; GTRAP48;;
KIAA0380
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1997) cloned ARHGEF11, which they designated
KIAA0380. The deduced 1,522-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with mouse Arhgef1 (601855), suggesting it has a role in cell
signaling and communication. RT-PCR detected weak ARHGEF11 expression in
all tissues examined.

Rumenapp et al. (1999) stated that the full-length KIAA0380 protein
contains 1,522 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 168.6
kD. It has an N-terminal PDZ domain, followed by a regulator of G
protein signaling (RGS) homology domain and tandem Dbl (MCF2; 311030)
homology (DH) and pleckstrin (PLEK; 173570) homology (PH) domains.
KIAA0380 also has proline-rich regions in its N- and C-terminal halves.

To identify proteins that interact with the C terminus of the EAAT4
(600637) protein, Jackson et al. (2001) used the last 77 amino acids of
EAAT4 as bait to screen a rat brain cDNA library. Jackson et al. (2001)
isolated 2 independent cDNA clones and called them Gtrap41 (SPTBN2;
604985) and Gtrap48. The largest ORF identified for Gtrap48 encodes a
protein of 1,527 amino acids with a predicted relative molecular mass of
168,698 Da. Gtrap48 shares 90% amino acid identity with human KIAA0380,
as well as significant homology with ARHGEF1. Gtrap48 possesses a PDZ
domain, an RGS sequence, tandem DH and PH domains characteristic of
guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Rho family of G proteins,
and 2 proline-rich sequences. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb
Gtrap48 mRNA in brain tissue. Longer exposure revealed a low level of
expression in liver and kidney. Gtrap48 was expressed predominantly in
rat cerebellum, with low level immunoreactivity in striatum,
hippocampus, and thalamus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transfected human embryonic kidney cells, Rumenapp et al. (1999)
showed that N-terminally truncated forms of KIAA0380 containing the DH
and PH domains bound RhoA (165390) and exhibited guanine nucleotide
exchange factor activity for RhoA. They did not bind or activate RAC1
(602048) or CDC42 (116952). When expressed in a human bladder carcinoma
cell line, N-terminally truncated forms of KIAA0380 containing the DH
and PH domains induced actin stress fiber formation, a cellular response
known to be controlled by RhoA. Expression of the isolated RGS homology
domain of KIAA0380 prevented stress fiber formation induced by the G
protein-coupled lysophosphatidic acid receptor (see LPAR1; 602282).

By immunofluorescence microscopy, Jackson et al. (2001) found that rat
Eaat4, Gtrap41, and Gtrap48 were all expressed in cerebellar Purkinje
cell soma and dendrites, with little axonal staining. Gtrap48 was found
to activate Rho. Expression of Gtrap48 induced reorganization of the
actin cytoskeleton. When Gtrap41 and Gtrap48 were coexpressed, Gtrap41
colocalized with actin in structures that resembled actin stress fibers.
Overexpression of Gtrap48 also induced formation of membrane ruffling
and filopodia. Jackson et al. (2001) measured the sodium-dependent
glutamate transport activity of HEK-Eaat4 cells that had been
transfected with 1 or both of the interacting proteins. Gtrap41 and
Gtrap48 produced respective 2-fold and 4-fold increases in glutamate
transport, and their coexpression resulted in a further increase in
glutamate uptake. Kinetic analysis indicated that Gtrap41 and Gtrap48
produced an increase in the V(max) of glutamate transport activity. The
authors suggested Gtrap41 and Gtrap48 may therefore enhance glutamate
transport either through an increase in the catalytic rate of the
transporter or through an increase in cell surface availability. Gtrap41
and Gtrap48 stabilized Eaat4 at the plasma membrane. The Eaat4/Gtrap48
interaction was important in modulating Eaat4 uptake activity. Jackson
et al. (2001) concluded that, in the modulation of EAAT4 glutamate
transport, their findings implicate a role for G protein signaling, a
pathway that may involve Rho activation, and anchoring to the actin
cytoskeleton. These proteins may also modulate the perisynaptic
distribution of EAAT4 at glutamatergic synapses.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Longhurst et al. (2006) showed that rat
PDZ-RhoGEF interacted with light chain-2 (LC2) of microtubule-associated
protein-1 (MAP1A; 600178), and they confirmed the interaction through
protein pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Mutation analysis
revealed that the carboxylate-binding loop of the PDZ domain of
PDZ-RhoGEF was required for the interaction. PDZ-RhoGEF proteins with
mutations in the carboxylate-binding loop induced changes in cell
morphology and actin organization. These mutants altered the activation
of Rho GTPases, and coexpression of dominant-negative Rho GTPases
prevented the morphologic changes. In cells expressing wildtype rat
PDZ-RhoGEF, drug-induced microtubule depolymerization produced changes
in cell morphology similar to those induced by PDZ-RhoGEF mutants.
Longhurst et al. (2006) concluded that modulation of the guanine
nucleotide exchange activity of PDZ-RhoGEF through interaction with
microtubule-associated protein light chains may coordinate microtubule
integrity and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the
ARGHEF11 gene to chromosome 1.

By sequence similarity between the KIAA0380 sequence and a genomic
contig (GenBank GENBANK NT_004327), Scott (2001) mapped the human
ARHGEF11 gene to chromosome 1q21.

603890	TITLE *603890 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2L 6; UBE2L6
;;UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME UBCH8; UBCH8
DESCRIPTION Ubiquitination of a protein substrate requires the concerted action of 3
classes of enzymes: E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin protein ligases. See
600012. E2 enzymes may transfer ubiquitin either directly to a substrate
or to an E3 protein. Class I E2s are unable to transfer ubiquitin to
proteins in vitro, suggesting that this class of E2s may require an E3
enzyme for substrate recognition. Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay with the
E3 enzyme E6AP (601623) as bait, Kumar et al. (1997) identified cDNAs
encoding a novel class I E2 that they named UBCH8. The predicted
152-amino acid UBCH8 protein is 46% identical to UBCH7 (603721). In
vitro, recombinant Ubch8 formed thiol ester complexes with ubiquitin and
was able to transfer ubiquitin to E6AP. Both UBCH7 and UBCH8
specifically associated with E6AP in yeast 2-hybrid assays, while UBCH5
(602961) and UBCH6 (602916) interacted selectively with an S. cerevisiae
E3, RSP5 (see 602278). In vitro, the E6AP-interacting E2s were also able
to function with E6AP in the ubiquitination of a substrate, whereas
noninteracting E2s were unable to do so. The authors suggested that
selective physical interaction between E2 and E3 enzymes forms the basis
of specificity for functionally distinct E2-E3 combinations.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ardley et al. (2000) mapped the
UBE2L6 gene to chromosome 11q12.

601515	TITLE *601515 FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 14; FGF14
;;FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR HOMOLOGOUS FACTOR 4; FHF4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FGF14 belongs to a subclass of fibroblast growth factors that are
expressed in the developing and adult central nervous system (Smallwood
et al., 1996). For a discussion on the FGF gene family, see FGF12
(601513).

CLONING

Smallwood et al. (1996) identified and characterized 4 novel members of
the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, including FGF14, which they
called FHF4. The genes were identified by a combination of random cDNA
sequencing, database searches, and degenerate PCR.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2000) characterized 2 mouse isoforms of Fgf14, which they
called Fgf14-1a and Fgf14-1b, resulting from alternative first exons. In
situ hybridization showed that Fgf14 is widely expressed in mouse brain,
spinal cord, major arteries, and thymus between embryonic days 12.5 and
14.5. In mouse cerebellar development, Fgf14 was first observed at
postnatal day 1 in postmitotic granule cells and later in migrating and
postmigratory granule cells. The Fgf14 expression pattern in cerebellum
was complementary to that of Math1 (ATOH1; 601461), a marker for
proliferating granule cells in the external germinal layer.

MAPPING

By Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA from rodent/human hybrid
cell lines carrying individual human chromosomes, Smallwood et al.
(1996) mapped the FGF14 gene to chromosome 13. Using an interspecific
backcross mapping panel, they mapped the mouse homolog to chromosome 14,
very close to the Rap2a (179540) gene, which in the human maps to 13q34.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large 3-generation Dutch family with early-onset tremor,
dyskinesia, and slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia (SCA27; 609307),
van Swieten et al. (2003) found a phe145-to-ser mutation in the FGF14
gene (F145S; 601515.0001). The disorder was consistent with the
occurrence of ataxia and paroxysmal dyskinesia in Fgf14 knockout mice
(Wang et al., 2002).

In 1 of 208 unrelated patients with familial ataxia, Dalski et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion in the FGF14 gene
(601515.0002). The patient had early onset of the disorder and mild
mental retardation.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the role of Fgf14 in CNS development and adult brain function,
Wang et al. (2002) generated Fgf14-deficient mice that expressed an
FGF14/beta-galactosidase fusion protein in place of the normal Fgf14
protein. The Fgf14-deficient mice were viable, fertile, and anatomically
normal, but developed ataxia and a paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement
disorder. The authors noted that the motor abnormalities are associated
with dysfunction of the basal ganglia system and resemble several human
dystonia syndromes. Using neuropharmacologic studies, Wang et al. (2002)
showed that the Fgf14-deficient mice had reduced responses to dopamine
agonists. They suggested a function for Fgf14 in neuronal signaling,
axonal trafficking, and synaptosomal function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 27
FGF14, PHE145SER

In affected members of a 3-generation Dutch family with autosomal
dominant spinocerebellar ataxia-27 (609307), van Swieten et al. (2003)
identified a phe145-to-ser (F145S) mutation in the FGF14 gene. As
indicated by protein modeling, the amino acid change was predicted to
reduce the stability of the protein.

.0002
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 27
FGF14, 1-BP DEL, 487A

In a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia-27 (609307), Dalski et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (487delA) in exon 4 of
the FGF14 gene, resulting in premature termination of the protein and
loss of one-third of amino acid residues. The mutation was not
identified in 208 control samples. The patient had early onset of the
disorder and mild mental retardation.

611883	TITLE *611883 BRCA2- AND CDKN1A-INTERACTING PROTEIN; BCCIP
;;p21- AND CDK-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; TOK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the C-terminal half of p21 (CDK1A; 116899) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library, Ono et al. (2000) cloned BCCIP,
which they called TOK1. EST database analysis and PCR of a brain cDNA
library revealed 2 TOK1 variants, TOK1-alpha and -beta. The deduced
proteins contain 322 and 314 amino acids, respectively, and are
identical for the first 259 amino acids. Northern blot analysis using a
probe common to both TOK1 variants detected a major 1.5-kb transcript
and a minor 3-kb transcript. Specific probes detected both TOK1 variants
as 1.5-kb transcripts. TOK1-alpha was highly expressed in skeletal
muscle, with little to no expression in other tissues examined.
TOK1-beta was highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, moderately
expressed in placenta and pancreas, and weakly expressed in brain,
kidney, and liver. Western blot analysis detected TOK1-alpha and
TOK1-beta as 50- and 45-kD proteins, respectively. In synchronized HeLa
cells, expression of TOK1-alpha began after G2/M phase and peaked before
S phase. TOK1-beta was expressed throughout the cell cycle, but like
TOK1-alpha, its expression increased before S phase.

Using an internal conserved region of BRCA2 (600185) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, followed by database analysis, Liu et al. (2001) cloned
BCCIP-alpha and -beta, which correspond to TOK1-alpha and -beta,
respectively. Both BCCIP isoforms have an N-terminal acidic domain and
an evolutionarily conserved internal domain, followed by the C-terminal
variable domain. The internal domain contains a putative calcium-binding
domain. Western blot analysis detected both BCCIP proteins in all
tissues examined. Immunohistochemical analysis of several human cell
lines showed nuclear expression of endogenous BCCIP.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mutation analysis, Ono et al. (2000) found that TOK1-alpha bound
to the C-terminal proximal region of p21. However, TOK1-beta did not
bind p21. TOK1-alpha formed a ternary complex with p21 and an active
form of CDK2 (116953) in human embryonic kidney cells via its
interaction with p21. TOK1-alpha enhanced the inhibitory activity of p21
toward the histone H1 (see 142709) kinase activity of CDK2.

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney
cells, Liu et al. (2001) confirmed that BCCIP-alpha interacted with
endogenous BRCA2. Expression of BCCIP-beta protein was relatively
consistent among various tumor cell lines examined. In contrast,
expression of BCCIP-alpha protein was reduced in some brain, breast, and
endometrial tumor cell lines and increased in some endometrial tumor
cell lines, with relatively consistent expression among lung cancer cell
lines. BCCIP-alpha expression inhibited growth of some breast and brain
tumor cells, but it had no effect on other types of cancer cells.

Lu et al. (2007) stated that BCCIP regulates BRCA2 and RAD51 (179617)
nuclear focus formation, DNA double-strand break-induced homologous
recombination, and cell cycle progression. They transfected full-length
and truncated fragments of BCCIP into a human fibrosarcoma cell line and
found that BCCIP fragments that interacted with either BRCA2 or p21
inhibited homologous recombination similarly. Transient downregulation
of BCCIP in human cells did not affect nonspecific integration of
transfected DNA, but it significantly inhibited homology-directed gene
targeting. Cells with constitutive downregulation of BCCIP showed
increased levels of spontaneous single-stranded DNA and double-strand
breaks. Lu et al. (2007) concluded that multiple domains of BCCIP are
involved in homologous recombination and that BCCIP plays a critical
role in resolving spontaneous DNA damage.

Using a matched normal/tumor cDNA array, Meng et al. (2003) found
reduced expression of both BCCIP-alpha and -beta in kidney tumors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Meng et al. (2003) determined that the BCCIP gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 30 kb. The 5-prime end of the BCCIP gene abuts the UROS gene
(606938) on the opposite strand in a head-to-head manner. BCCIP and UROS
share a functional intergenic bidirectional promoter that contains
binding sites for various transcription factors. The last 3 exons of
BCCIP overlap with seven 3-prime exons of the DHX32 gene (607960) on the
opposite strand.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2001) mapped the
BCCIP gene to chromosome 10q25.3-q26.2.

613039	TITLE *613039 CHROMODOMAIN HELICASE DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 1-LIKE; CHD1L
;;AMPLIFIED IN LIVER CANCER 1; ALC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In response to DNA strand breaks, chromatin adopts a relaxed structure
due to the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) to chromatin proteins by
PARP enzymes (see PARP1; 173870), and this relaxation facilitates the
repair of DNA damage. CHD1L interacts with PAR and has a role in
chromatin relaxation following DNA damage (Ahel et al., 2009).

CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1q amplified in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 114550), Ma et al. (2008) cloned CHD1L,
which they designated ALC1. The deduced 897-amino acid protein contains
an SNF2 (see 300012)-like N-terminal helicase domain, followed by a
helicase superfamily C-terminal domain and a putative PAR-binding macro
domain. Fluorescence-tagged ALC1 localized to the nucleus in transfected
cells. Western blot analysis detected ALC1 at an apparent molecular mass
of 98 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Ma et al. (2008) found that ALC1 was
overexpressed in more than 50% of informative HCC cases, primary HCCs,
and HCC cell lines. Transfection of ALC1 in human liver and HCC cell
lines increased colony formation in soft agar compared with vector
controls and increased tumorigenicity of these cell lines in nude mice.
Overexpression of ALC1 facilitated DNA synthesis and promoted G1/S phase
transition. ALC1 downregulated expression of the cell growth inhibitors
p53 (TP53; 191170) and p21(Waf1) (CDKN1A; 116899) and the proapoptotic
proteins caspase-3 (600636) and BAX (600040) and upregulated the cell
cycle regulators CDK2 (116953) and cyclin E (CCNE1; 123837). Knockdown
of ALC1 by RNA interference reduced the percentage of cells in S phase,
reduced colony formation in soft agar, and inhibited the cell cycle at
the G1/S checkpoint. Ma et al. (2008) concluded that ALC1 is an oncogene
that plays a role in HCC pathogenesis.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Ahel et al. (2009) showed that human
ALC1 bound PAR in vitro, and the interaction required the macro domain
of ALC1. Epitope-tagged ALC1 immunoprecipitated endogenous PAR from
transfected 293 cells, along with PARP1 and core nucleosome components.
Mass spectroscopy also revealed the presence of several DNA repair
enzymes in the immunoprecipitate. ALC1 showed weak ATPase activity on
its own that was attributed to its helicase domain, and this activity
was stimulated by the addition of DNA and nucleosomes. PARP1 also
stimulated the ATPase activity of ALC1 in an NAD(+)- and DNA-dependent
manner. Wildtype ALC1, but not an ATPase-dead mutant, promoted
nucleosome sliding in an ATP-dependent manner. Endogenous ALC1 rapidly
but transiently localized to sites of DNA damage, and this localization
required ALC1 ATPase activity and functional PARP1. Ahel et al. (2009)
concluded that ALC1 is a nucleosome-repositioning enzyme that is
targeted to sites of DNA damage through its interaction with PAR, and
that ALC1 functions to regulate chromatin during DNA repair.

MAPPING

By FISH, Ma et al. (2008) mapped the CHD1L gene to a region of
chromosome 1q21 amplified in HCCs and other solid tumors.

602224	TITLE *602224 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 4E-BINDING PROTEIN 2; EIF4EBP2
;;4EBP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Pause et al. (1994) reported that the 4EBP2 gene encodes a 120-amino
acid polypeptide that is 56% identical to that of 4EBP1 (602223). By
Northern blot analysis, Tsukiyama-Kohara et al. (1996) showed that a
major 3.5-kb transcript of 4EBP2 is expressed ubiquitously.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsukiyama-Kohara et al. (1996) analyzed the genomic structure of the
mouse EIF4EBP2 gene and showed that it consists of 3 exons and spans 20
kb. Its intron/exon structure is identical to that of EIF4EBP1.

Colina et al. (2008) showed that translational control is critical for
induction of type I interferon (see 147570) production. In mouse
embryonic fibroblasts lacking the translational repressors 4Ebp1 and
4Ebp2, the threshold for eliciting type I interferon production is
lowered. Consequently, replication of encephalomyocarditis virus,
vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus, and Sindbis virus is
markedly suppressed. Furthermore, Colina et al. (2008) showed that mice
with both 4Ebp1 and 4Ebp2 genes knocked out are resistant to vesicular
stomatitis virus infection, and this correlates with an enhanced type I
interferon production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and the expression
of interferon-regulated genes in the lungs. The enhanced type I
interferon response of 4Ebp1 -/- 4Ebp2 -/- double knockout mouse
embryonic fibroblasts is caused by upregulation of interferon regulatory
factor-7 (Irf7; 605047) mRNA translation. Colina et al. (2008) found
that their findings highlighted the role of 4EBPs as negative regulators
of type I interferon production, via translational repression of IRF7
mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Dowling et al. (2010) inhibited the mTORC1 (601231) pathway in cells
lacking EIF4EBP1, EIF4EBP2, and EIF4EBP3 (603483) and analyzed the
effects on cell size, cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression.
Although the EIF4EBPs had no effect on cell size, they inhibited cell
proliferation by selectively inhibiting the translation of mRNAs that
encode proliferation-promoting proteins and proteins involved in cell
cycle progression. Thus, Dowling et al. (2010) concluded that control of
cell size and cell cycle progression appear to be independent in
mammalian cells, whereas in lower eukaryotes, EIF4E binding proteins
influence both cell growth and proliferation.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Tsukiyama-Kohara et al. (1996)
mapped the EIF4EBP2 gene to human chromosome 10q21-q22. They noted that
chromosomal alterations in this region have been found in some human
cancers. Tsukiyama-Kohara et al. (1996) mapped the mouse 4EBP2 gene to
chromosome 10B4-B5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gkogkas et al. (2013) demonstrated that knockout of EIF4EBP2, (an EIF4E
(133440) repressor downstream of MTOR), or EIF4E overexpression leads to
increased translation of neuroligins, which are postsynaptic proteins
that are causally linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mice with
knockout of Eif4ebp2 exhibit an increased ratio of excitatory to
inhibitory synaptic inputs and autistic-like behaviors (i.e., social
interaction deficits, altered communication, and repetitive/stereotyped
behaviors). Pharmacologic inhibition of Eif4e activity or normalization
of neuroligin-1 (600568), but not neuroligin-2 (606479), protein levels
restored the normal excitation/inhibition ratio and rectified the social
behavior deficits. Thus, Gkogkas et al. (2013) concluded that
translational control by EIF4E regulates the synthesis of neuroligins,
maintaining the excitation-to-inhibition balance, and its dysregulation
engenders ASD-like phenotypes.

607995	TITLE *607995 UNC93, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A; UNC93A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a candidate gene approach in the region of frequent allele loss on
chromosome 6q27 in sporadic ovarian cancer, Liu et al. (2002) identified
a human homolog of C. elegans unc93. The full-length UNC93A cDNA encodes
a deduced 457-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 50
kD. The protein contains a leader peptide followed by 7 transmembrane
domains. It shares 30% sequence identity with the C. elegans protein.
Northern blot analysis revealed a major transcript of approximately 2.1
kb in testis, small intestine, and colon; a smaller transcript of 1.1 kb
was also detected in spleen, prostate, ovary, small intestine, and
colon. No expression was detected in 8 ovarian cancer cell lines.
Transient expression of a GFP-UNC93A fusion protein in 293T cells showed
localization to the membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liu et al. (2002) determined that the UNC93A gene contains 8 exons and
spans 24.5 kb. Alternative splicing results in 2 transcripts, one of
which lacks exon 4.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Liu et al. (2002) identified the UNC93A gene on
chromosome 6q27, centromeric to marker D6S149.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By mutation analysis of the UNC93A gene in a panel of ovarian tumors and
ovarian cancer cell lines, Liu et al. (2002) found no evidence that
UNC93A is a tumor suppressor gene in sporadic ovarian cancer.

612210	TITLE *612210 HIGHLY UPREGULATED IN LIVER CANCER; HULC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 114550)-specific cDNA microarray
platform, Panzitt et al. (2007) identified HULC, a novel mRNA-like
noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of
about 500 nucleotides predominantly in HCC patient tissue. HULC RNA
localized to the cytoplasm and copurified with ribosomes. The transcript
did not appear to be translated. Panzitt et al. (2007) identified HULC
orthologs in several primate species, but not in mouse or rat.

GENE FUNCTION

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Panzitt et al. (2007) detected markedly
elevated HULC RNA in HCC liver tissue and in 3 of 4 blood samples from
HCC patients. HULC was also upregulated, but to a lesser extent, in
nonneoplastic focal nodular hyperplasias and in cirrhotic liver tissue
compared with normal tissue. Knockdown of HULC in 2 human HCC cell lines
resulted in the altered expression of numerous genes, suggesting that
HULC may be a noncoding regulatory RNA. Panzitt et al. (2007) found no
significant homology between HULC and its putative target sequences,
suggesting that any regulatory role may be indirect.

GENE STRUCTURE

Panzitt et al. (2007) determined that the HULC gene contains 2 exons,
both of which have a high CpG content. Exon 1 consists mainly of a long
terminal repeat, suggesting integration of a retrotransposon.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Panzitt et al. (2007) mapped the HULC gene
to chromosome 6p24.3.

609731	TITLE *609731 CYSTATIN 11; CST11
;;CST8L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using subtractive hybridization to identify genes expressed in Macaca
mulatta epididymis, Hamil et al. (2002) identified a novel member of the
cystatin type 2 family of competitive reversible cysteine protease
inhibitors, which they called cystatin 11. By database searching, Hamil
et al. (2002) also identified a human homolog of CST11. An additional
CST11 cDNA, missing exon 2, was amplified by PCR from a human
caput/corpus library, indicating the presence of an alternatively
spliced mRNA. Northern blot analysis of multiple M. mulatta tissues
detected abundant expression of an 0.8-kb CST11 mRNA in all 3 regions of
the epididymis but not in any other tissues tested. Imunnohistochemical
staining of human epididymis localized the CST11 protein in epithelial
cell cytoplasm and nuclei and in the lumen throughout the epididymis.
Immuonofluorescence studies showed that CST11 is also found on
ejaculated human sperm, where it is localized to the postacrosomal and
tail regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Hamil et al. (2002) found that a 3-dimensional model of CST11, based on
x-ray crystallography data for chicken CST, suggested that the 3 regions
corresponding to the protease inhibitory wedge of cystatin-3 (CST3;
604312) are similarly juxtaposed in CST11, consistent with protease
inhibitory function.

Using Northern blot analysis to study the level of CST11 mRNA in M.
Mulatta epididymis after castration and with or without androgen
replacement, Hamil et al. (2002) found that expression of CST11 is
dependent on testosterone. Consistent with this result, they showed that
the putative CST11 promoter contains a potential androgen response
element and at least 2 half sites.

Hamil et al. (2002) demonstrated that a 2-hour incubation of E. coli
with recombinant CST11 or exon 2-deleted CST11 protein resulted in a 30%
loss of colony-forming units, indicating that both forms have
antimicrobial activity.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Hamil et al. (2002) mapped the CST11 gene to
chromosome 20p11.21 near 3 other CST genes that are predominantly
expressed in the male reproductive tract.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hamil et al. (2002) demonstrated that the structure of CST11 is well
conserved with other CST2 family genes, having 3 exons and 2 identically
positioned introns.

606910	TITLE *606910 BCL2-LIKE 10; BCL2L10
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

BCL2 (151430) is a prototypic mammalian regulator of cell death. Certain
members of the BCL2 family inhibit apoptosis, while other members
facilitate this physiologic process of cell death.

Using the amino acid sequence of mouse Boo/Diva as query, Ke et al.
(2001) identified BCL2L10 in human EST and genomic databases and cloned
a BCL2L10 cDNA from a human liver cDNA library. The deduced 204-amino
acid protein contains regions resembling the BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4
domains typical of antiapoptotic members of the BCL2 family, as well as
a putative C-terminal transmembrane domain. BCL2L10 and the mouse
homolog share 47% sequence identity. RT-PCR of multiple human tissues
revealed highest expression in liver, intermediate expression in brain,
lung, pancreas and ovary, and lowest expression in heart, spleen,
thymus, colon, leukocytes, intestine, testis, and prostate.

By database searching and use of PCR, Zhang et al. (2001) identified
BCL2L10 and found that it contains conserved BH4, BH1, and BH2 domains
but lacks a BH3 domain.

Lee et al. (2001) cloned BCL2L10 from a human fetal liver and spleen
cDNA library. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.2-kb message in liver
and kidney. Immunolocalization studies showed that BCL2L10 is diffusely
expressed in the cytosol of hepatocytes and in epithelial cells of
ovarian follicles.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Ke et al. (2001) found interaction
between BCL2L10 and BAX (600040), BCL2, and BCLXL (600039), but not with
BAK (600516). By transient transfection performed in 4 different human
tumor cell lines, Ke et al. (2001) determined that BCL2L10 has
antiapoptotic action. Stable overexpression in HeLa cells also resulted
in increased resistance to diverse apoptotic stimuli. The authors noted,
however, that because BCL2L10 is capable of associating either with the
antiapoptotic proteins BCL2 and BCLXL or with the proapoptotic protein
BAX, it is possible that BCL2L10 could display different phenotypes
depending on the cellular context.

By transfection experiments, Zhang et al. (2001) demonstrated that
BCL2L10 can block apoptosis induced by interleukin-3 (147740) withdrawal
and Bax (600040) expression, by prevention of cytochrome C (123970)
release, caspase-3 (600636) activation, and mitochondrial membrane
potential collapse. BCL2L10 did not block TNF-alpha (191160)-induced
apoptosis. Furthermore, both the BH4 domain and the transmembrane domain
of BCL2L10 were necessary for its suppressive action on cell death.
Zhang et al. (2001) concluded that BCL2L10 is an antiapoptotic member of
the BCL2 family and that it blocks apoptosis in the mitochondrial death
pathway, but not in the death receptor pathway.

By immunoprecipitation studies of BCL2L10-transfected cells, Lee et al.
(2001) confirmed interaction between BCL2L10 and BCLXL. By transient
transfection of fluorescence-tagged BCL2L10, Lee et al (2001) found
that, upon induction of apoptosis, the well-dispersed intracellular
granular localization pattern shifted to the perinuclear compartment,
with staining overlapping that of a mitochondrial marker. In contrast to
the results of Ke et al. (2001), Lee et al. (2001) found that
overexpression of BCL2L10 promoted cell death in HeLa and human kidney
cells.

Naumann et al. (2001) investigated the effect of BCL2L10 on induction of
apoptosis with the CD95 (134637) ligand and with chemotherapeutic drugs
in human malignant glioma cell lines. BCL2L10-transfected cells were
more sensitive to serum deprivation and became growth arrested in G0/1
in contrast to parental cells or mock-transfected cells.
BCL2L10-transfected glioma cells were also more resistant to induction
of apoptosis. BCL2L10 reduced caspase activation, including caspases 8
and 3, but did not prevent release of cytochrome c. The authors noted,
however, that others have found BCL2L10 to induce apoptosis in other
cell systems.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ke et al. (2001) determined that the BCL2L10 gene contains 2 exons.

MAPPING

Ke et al. (2001) mapped the BCL2L10 gene to chromosome 15q21 based on
sequence similarity between the BCL2L10 sequence and a genomic clone
(GenBank GENBANK CTD-2184D3) localized to 15q21. Lee et al. (2001)
mapped BCL2L10 to chromosome 15q21 by radiation hybrid analysis. The
corresponding mouse gene maps to a region of syntenic homology on
chromosome 9D9.

603491	TITLE *603491 IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 3; IGSF3
DESCRIPTION Saupe et al. (1998) isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like membrane protein, named immunoglobulin
superfamily member-3 (IGSF3). The deduced 1,215-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal signal sequence followed by a large extracellular
domain composed of 8 Ig-like domains with 7 potential N-glycosylation
sites; a potential hydrophobic transmembrane domain; and a C-terminal
charged cytoplasmic tail. The Ig-like domains are of the V type, and a
search of the sequence databases revealed that the IGSF3 protein is 32%
identical to human V7 (604516), a leukocyte surface protein. The authors
detected a major 8-kb mRNA and minor 6- and 4-kb mRNA species in a
variety of human tissues by Northern blot analysis.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and somatic cell hybrid analyses,
Saupe et al. (1998) localized the human IGSF3 gene to 1p13 and
demonstrated the presence of related sequences on chromosomes 2 and 13.

120105	TITLE *120105 COLIPASE, PANCREATIC; CLPS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pancreatic colipase is a 12-kD polypeptide cofactor for pancreatic
lipase (EC 3.1.1.3; 246600), an enzyme essential for the absorption of
dietary long-chain triglyceride fatty acids. Colipase is thought to
anchor lipase noncovalently to the surface of lipid micelles,
counteracting the destabilizing influence of intestinal bile salts
(summary by Davis et al., 1991).

CLONING

Using primers derived from the known amino acid sequence, Davis et al.
(1991) employed the PCR to produce a cDNA clone corresponding to the
complete coding region of the human procolipase mRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sims and Lowe (1992) found that the CLPS gene has 3 exons and that the
5-prime-flanking region contains a TATA box, a GC box, and a 28-bp
region with homology to the rat pancreatic-specific enhancer.

MAPPING

By the study of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids, Davis et al. (1991)
determined that the CLPS gene is located in the region 6pter-p21.1.

Sims and Lowe (1992) confirmed the assignment of the CLPS gene to
chromosome 6 by blots of hamster-human somatic cell hybrid DNA using the
entire colipase cDNA.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2006) reported a mechanism by which constant darkness
regulates the gene expression of fat catabolic enzymes in mice. Genes
for murine procolipase (Clps) and pancreatic lipase-related protein-2
(Plrp2; 604423) are activated in a circadian manner in peripheral organs
during 12-hour dark:12-hour dark (DD) but not light-dark (LD) cycles.
This mechanism is deregulated in circadian-deficient Per1/Per2 double
mutant mice. Zhang et al. (2006) identified circadian-regulated
5-prime-AMP, which is elevated in the blood of DD mice, as a key
mediator of this response. Synthetic 5-prime-AMP induced torpor (a
hibernation-like state) and murine Clps expression in LD mice. Torpor
induced by metabolic stress was associated with elevated 5-prime-AMP
levels in DD mice. Levels of glucose and nonesterified fatty acid in the
blood were reversed in DD and LD mice. Induction of murine Clps
expression by 5-prime-AMP in LD mice was reciprocally linked to blood
glucose levels. Zhang et al. (2006) concluded that their findings
uncovered a circadian metabolic rhythm in mammals.

DESCRIPTION Wicki et al. (1996) reported the characterization of a human gene they
symbolized S100A13, a calcium-binding protein belonging to the S100
protein family. S100 proteins are small EF-hand calcium-binding proteins
of variable lengths and sequence identities. At least 12 of 15 members
of the family are clustered on chromosome 1q21 (see S100A1; 176940);
S100A13 likewise colocalizes with S100A1 on the 1q21 cluster. The
predicted 98 amino acid S100A13 protein shows sequence homologies to
other S100 proteins between 50.5% (S100A5; 176991) and 59.3% (S100A12;
603112). Northern blot analysis showed high amounts of S100A13 mRNA in
adult skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, ovary, spleen, small intestine,
and pancreas and in fetal lung, heart, cochlea, liver, spleen, and
parathyroid tumor cells. Moderate levels were detected in all other
tissues examined, with the exception of placenta and leukocytes, which
had very low or undetectable levels. Wicki et al. (1996) also cloned the
mouse S100A13 gene. Mouse S100A13 is composed of 98 amino acids and
displays 86.7% homology compared to human S100A13.

615393	TITLE *615393 MTERF DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; MTERFD2
;;MITOCHONDRIAL TRANSCRIPTION TERMINATION FACTOR 4; MTERF4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MTERFD2 forms a stoichiometric complex with the 5-methylcytosine RNA
methyltransferase NSUN4 (615394). By binding to both ribosomal RNA and
NSUN4, MTERFD2 recruits NSUN4 to the large ribosomal subunit, an
essential step in ribosomal biogenesis (Spahr et al., 2012).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of HeLa cell total RNA, Yu et al. (2011) cloned MTERFD2, which
they called MTERF4. The deduced 381-amino acid protein has a predicted
mitochondrial localization signal, multiple leucine zipper motifs, 2
basic DNA-binding domains, and a C terminus with many acidic amino acids
not found in other MTERF proteins. Fluorescence-tagged MTERF4 localized
to mitochondria in transfected HeLa cells.

Using Northern blot analysis, Camara et al. (2011) detected variable
Mterf4 expression in all mouse tissues examined. Fluorescence-tagged
mouse or human MTERF4 colocalized with mitochondrial markers following
transfection of HeLa cells. Sequence analysis revealed that MTERF4 was
processed into mature proteins beginning with either leu43 or asn48
following targeting to mitochondria.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the MTERFD2 gene to chromosome 2q37.3 based on an
alignment of the MTERFD2 sequence (Genbank GENBANK AF161359) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using small interfering RNA, Yu et al. (2011) found that knockdown of
MTERF4 in HeLa cells suppressed cell growth and induced accumulation of
cells in sub-G1. Downregulation of MTERF4 also significantly induced
necrosis, but not apoptosis.

By immunoprecipitation analysis and size-exclusion chromatography,
Camara et al. (2011) showed that the mature mitochondrial forms of NSUN4
and MTERF4 (beginning with asn48) interacted in HeLa cells to form a
dimer with an apparent molecular mass of 112 kD . The epitope-tagged
MTERF4-NSUN4 complex comigrated with the large (39S) mitochondrial
ribosomal subunit following transfection in HeLa cells. Knockdown of
MTERF4 via RNA interference reduced targeting of NSUN4 to the 39S
subunit. RNA immunoprecipitation showed that epitope-tagged MTERF4
cross-linked with several ribosomal RNA species, including 16S, 12S, and
7S RNA. Camara et al. (2011) concluded that MTERF4 targets NSUN4 to
ribosomal RNA through to its ability to bind both NSUN4 and ribosomal
RNA.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Spahr et al. (2012) described the structure of the NSUN4-MTERF4
heterodimeric complex at 2.9-angstrom resolution. They found that MTERF4
is an all alpha-helical protein that adopts a half-doughnut shape with a
right-handed superhelical twist. MTERF4 bound NSUN4 through conserved
polar and hydrophobic interactions. A positively-charged RNA-binding
path extended along the concave and convex sides of MTERF4 and into the
active site of NSUN4 near the the binding site for the methyl donor
S-adenosyl-L-methionine.

ANIMAL MODEL

Camara et al. (2011) found that knockout of Mterf4 in mice was embryonic
lethal. At embryonic day 8.5, Mterf4 -/- embryos were smaller than
wildtype and lacked a heart and optic discs. Targeted knockout of Mterf4
in cardiac tissue caused gradual accumulation of myocardial mitochondria
with abnormal morphology from 5 weeks of age, and reduced life span to
21 weeks of age. Analysis of steady-state levels of respiratory chain
complexes in Mterf4 -/- hearts revealed reduced assembly of
mitochondrial encoded subunits (complex I, III, IV, and V) compared with
exclusively nuclear-encoded complex II, accompanied by reduced
respiratory chain activities. Mterf4 -/- hearts also showed massively
increased transcription of mitochondrial DNA coupled with impaired
translation, as well as dramatically increased levels of the 28S and 39S
mitochondrial ribosomes without a corresponding increase in the
assembled 55S ribosome.

;;PCDH-BETA-11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules, and
protocadherins constitute a subfamily of nonclassic cadherins. PCDHB11
is 1 of 16 tandemly arranged genes in the PCDHB gene cluster (604967) on
chromosome 5q31. Unlike the PCDHA (see 604966) and PCDHG (see 604968)
genes, which function as 'variable' exons that are spliced to downstream
constant region exons to produce mRNAs, the PCDHB genes do not use
constant region exons to produce mRNAs. Thus, each single-exon PCDHB
gene encodes the extracellular, transmembrane, and short cytoplasmic
domains of the protein (Wu et al., 2001). For further information on the
PCDHB genes, see 604967.

CLONING

Using PCR with degenerate primers to screen melanoma cell lines,
Matsuyoshi et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA fragment encoding part of
PCDHB11, which they termed ME2. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of
ME2 in melanoma, squamous carcinoma, and normal fibroblast cell lines,
but not in normal melanocytes, suggesting that ME2 may play a role in
the strong cell-cell adhesiveness of melanoma cells.

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Wu and Maniatis (1999) cloned
full-length PCDHB11.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2001) mapped the PCDHB11 gene
to chromosome 5q31. They localized the mouse PCDHB genes to chromosome
18c.

;;SAPK-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; SIN1;;
MEKK2-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; MIP1;;
JC310
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SIN1, MTOR (FRAP1; 601231), RICTOR (609022), and LST8 (GBL; 612190) are
components of TORC2, a protein kinase complex involved in AKT (164730)
phosphorylation and cell signaling (Yang et al., 2006).

CLONING

By screening an expression library for cDNAs that suppressed the heat
shock-sensitive phenotype of yeast with an activated Ras2 gene (see
HRAS; 190020), Colicelli et al. (1991) obtained a partial cDNA encoding
MAPKAP1, which they called JC310.

By searching an EST database with the partial JC310 sequence, followed
by RT-PCR, Schroder et al. (2004) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding
MAPKAP1, which they called SIN1. The deduced 522-amino acid protein has
a nuclear localization signal, 2 bipartite nuclear localization signals,
a peroxisomal targeting signal, and a PEST motif for rapid protein
degradation. Comparison of SIN1 with homologs from various species
revealed a short, highly conserved region, designated Box1, located
within a larger conserved domain, designated CRIM (conserved region in
middle). Schroder et al. (2004) also identified several SIN1 splice
variants, including SIN1-alpha, which encodes a 323-amino acid
C-terminally truncated protein, and SIN1-beta and SIN1-gamma, which
encode 487- and 475-amino acid proteins, respectively, with internal
deletions. Two other variants, SIN1-delta and SIN1-epsilon, lack the
first coding exon and the first 2 coding exons of SIN1, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected SIN1 transcripts of 3.8 and 2.6 kb in
all tissues examined, with highest levels in skeletal muscle and heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Yang et al. (2006) identified SIN1 as an essential component of TORC2,
but not TORC1. SIN1 specifically interacted with MTOR and RICTOR, but
not RAPTOR (607130), the defining component of the TORC1 complex.
Knockdown of SIN1 resulted in decreased RICTOR phosphorylation and
protein levels, as well as disruption of binding between RICTOR and
MTOR. RICTOR knockdown dramatically decreased SIN1 protein levels.
Knockdown of SIN1 in both Drosophila and human cells diminished AKT
phosphorylation, and SIN1-knockdown cells displayed less phosphorylation
of AKT substrates and more sensitivity to apoptosis.

Independently, Jacinto et al. (2006) identified SIN1 as an essential
TORC2 subunit in human cells. Phosphorylation of Akt at ser473 was lost
in Sin1 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), whereas phosphorylation
of thr308 was unaffected. Defective ser473 phosphorylation affected only
a subset of Akt targets in vivo, including Foxo1 (136533) and Foxo3a
(602681). Sin1 -/- MEFs were more sensitive to stress-induced apoptosis,
suggesting that phosphorylation of AKT at ser473 plays an important role
in cell survival.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schroder et al. (2004) determined that the MAPKAP1 gene contains 13
exons, the first of which is noncoding. The 5-prime region contains 2
short open reading frames of 9 and 5 codons, and the 3-prime region
contains 2 polyadenylation sites.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MAPKAP1
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP RH41772).

ANIMAL MODEL

Jacinto et al. (2006) found that Sin1 deletion was embryonic lethal in
mice due to early developmental problems.

EXTRACELLULAR SIGNAL-REGULATED KINASE 1; ERK1;;

p44MAPK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Charest et al. (1993) cloned a cDNA encoding a member of a family of
tyrosyl-phosphorylated and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
that participates in cell cycle progression. They referred to the
protein as p44(erk1) and the gene as ERK1. The cDNA encodes a 379-amino
acid polypeptide sharing approximately 96% predicted amino acid identity
with partial sequences of rodent erk1 cognates. They also characterized
the enzyme biochemically.

MAPPING

Charest et al. (1993) mapped the MAPK3 gene to human chromosome 16 by
hybrid cell panel analysis. Li et al. (1994) assigned human MAPK3 and
MAPK1 to 16p11.2 and 22q11.2, respectively, by a combination of Southern
blotting of a human-hamster hybrid panel and fluorescence in situ
hybridization. The chromosome region surrounding 16p11.2 displays high
homology with mouse chromosome 7, and human 22q11.2 is homologous to
mouse chromosome 16. Saba-El-Leil et al. (1997) mapped the murine
homolog (Mapk3) to mouse chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Experience-dependent plasticity in the developing visual cortex depends
on electrical activity and molecular signals involved in stabilization
or removal of inputs. ERK1 and ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) activation in the
cortex is regulated by both factors. Di Cristo et al. (2001)
demonstrated that 2 different inhibitors of the ERK pathway suppress the
induction of 2 forms of long-term potentiation in rat cortical slices
and that their intracortical administration to monocularly deprived rats
prevents the shift in ocular dominance towards the nondeprived eye. Di
Cristo et al. (2001) concluded that the ERK pathway is necessary for
experience-dependent plasticity and for long-term potentiation of
synaptic transmission in the developing visual cortex.

Stefanovsky et al. (2001) showed that epidermal growth factor (131530)
induces immediate, ERK1/ERK2-dependent activation of endogenous
ribosomal transcription, while inactivation of ERK1/ERK2 causes an
equally immediate reversion to the basal transcription level. ERK1/ERK2
was found to phosphorylate the architectural transcription factor UBF
(600673) at amino acids 117 and 201 within HMG boxes 1 and 2, preventing
their interaction with DNA. Mutation of these sites inhibited
transcription activation and abrogated the transcriptional response to
ERK1/ERK2. Thus, growth factor regulation of ribosomal transcription
likely acts by a cyclic modulation of DNA architecture. The data
suggested a central role for ribosome biogenesis in growth regulation.

Using an in situ phosphorylation screening strategy to identify protein
kinase substrates, Fukunaga and Hunter (1997) identified MNK1 (MKNK1;
606724) as an ERK1 substrate. Using 2-hybrid tests and in vitro
association experiments, Waskiewicz et al. (1997) demonstrated that
mouse Mnk1 and Mnk2 (MKNK2; 605069) bind tightly to Erk1 and Erk2
through a C-terminal domain. Mnk1 complexes more strongly with inactive
than active Erk, and the authors hypothesized that Mnk and Erk may
dissociate after mitogen stimulation.

Forcet et al. (2002) showed that in embryonic kidney cells expressing
full-length, but not cytoplasmic domain-truncated, DCC (120470), NTN1
(601614) causes increased transient phosphorylation and activity of ERK1
and ERK2, but not of JNK1 (601158), JNK2 (602896), or p38 (MAPK14;
600289). This phosphorylation was mediated by MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872)
and/or MEK2 (MAP2K2; 601263). NTN1 also activated the transcription
factor ELK1 (311040) and serum response element-regulated gene
expression. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed interaction of
full-length DCC with MEK1/2 in the presence or absence of NTN1. Forcet
et al. (2002) showed that activation of Dcc by Ntn1 in rat embryonic
day-13 dorsal spinal cord stimulates and is required for the outgrowth
of commissural axons and Erk1/2 activation. Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated expression of activated Erk1/2 in embryonic commissural
axons, and this expression was diminished in Dcc or Ntn1 knockout
animals. Forcet et al. (2002) concluded that the MAPK pathway is
involved in responses to NTN1 and proposed that ERK activation affects
axonal growth by phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins and
neurofilaments.

Anthrax lethal toxin (LT), a critical virulence factor of Bacillus
anthracis, is a complex of lethal factor (LF) and protective antigen
(PA). PA binds to the anthrax receptor (ATR; 606410) to facilitate the
entry of LF into the cell. LT disrupts the MAPK signaling pathway in
macrophages (Park et al., 2002). Agrawal et al. (2003) showed that, in
mice, LT impairs the function of dendritic cells (DCs), inhibiting the
upregulation of costimulatory molecules, such as CD40 (109535), CD80
(112203), and CD86 (601020), as well as cytokine secretion, in response
to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. LT-exposed DCs failed to stimulate
antigen-specific T and B cells in vivo, resulting in significant
reductions of circulating IgG antibody. Western blot analysis indicated
that LF severely impairs phosphorylation of p38, ERK1, and ERK2. A
cocktail of synthetic MAPK inhibitors inhibited cytokine production in a
manner similar to that of LF. Using a mutant form of LF lacking a
catalytic site necessary for cleavage of MEK1, MEK2, and MEK3 (602314),
the upstream activators of ERK1, ERK2, and p38, respectively, Agrawal et
al. (2003) found that cleavage of these MEKs is essential for
suppression of dendritic cell function. They proposed that this
mechanism might operate early in infection, when LT levels are low, to
impair immunity. Later in infection, Agrawal et al. (2003) noted, LT
might have quite different inflammatory effects.

Imai et al. (2008) used mouse models to explore the mechanism whereby
obesity enhances pancreatic beta cell mass, pathophysiologic
compensation for insulin resistance. Imai et al. (2008) found that
hepatic activation of ERK1 signaling by expression of constitutively
active MEK1 (176872) induced pancreatic beta cell proliferation through
a neuronal-mediated relay of metabolic signals. This metabolic relay
from the liver to the pancreas is involved in obesity-induced islet
expansion. In mouse models of insulin-deficient diabetes,
liver-selective activation of ERK signaling increased beta cell mass and
normalized serum glucose levels. Thus, Imai et al. (2008) concluded that
interorgan metabolic relay systems may serve as valuable targets in
regenerative treatments for diabetes.

In mouse hearts with pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy, Lorenz et al.
(2009) observed strong phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 at thr183, and in
failing human hearts, they found an approximately 5-fold increase in
thr188 phosphorylation compared to controls. The authors demonstrated
that thr188 autophosphorylation directs ERK1/ERK2 to phosphorylate
nuclear targets known to cause cardiac hypertrophy, and that thr188
phosphorylation requires activation and assembly of the entire RAF
(164760)-MEK-ERK kinase cascade, phosphorylation of the TEY motif,
dimerization of ERK1/ERK2, and binding to G protein beta-gamma subunits
(see 139390) released from activated Gq (see 600998). Experiments using
transgenic mouse models carrying mutations at thr188 suggested a causal
relationship to cardiac hypertrophy. Lorenz et al. (2009) proposed that
specific phosphorylation events on ERK1/ERK2 integrate differing
upstream signals to induce cardiac hypertrophy.

During early lung development, airway tubes change shape. Tube length
increases more than circumference as a large proportion of lung
epithelial cells divide parallel to the airway longitudinal axis. Tang
et al. (2011) showed that this bias is lost in mutants with increased
ERK1 and ERK2 activity, revealing a link between the ERK1/2 signaling
pathway and the control of mitotic spindle orientation. Using a
mathematical model, Tang et al. (2011) demonstrated that change in
airway shape can occur as a function of spindle angle distribution
determined by ERK1/2 signaling, independent of effects on cell
proliferation or cell size and shape. Tang et al. (2011) identified
sprouty genes (SPRY1, 602465; SPRY2, 602466), which encode negative
regulators of fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF10; 602115)-mediated
RAS-regulated ERK1/2 signaling, as essential for controlling airway
shape change during development through an effect on mitotic spindle
orientation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pages et al. (1999) generated p44 Mapk (Erk1)-deficient mice by
homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. The p44 Mapk were
viable, fertile, and of normal size. Thus, Pages et al. (1999) concluded
that p44 Mapk is apparently dispensable and that p42 Mapk (Erk2) may
compensate for its loss. However, in p44 Mapk -/- mice, thymocyte
maturation beyond the CD4+CD8+ stage was reduced by half, with a similar
diminution in the thymocyte subpopulation expressing high levels of T
cell receptor (CD3-high). In p44 Mapk -/- thymocytes, proliferation in
response to activation with a monoclonal antibody to the T cell receptor
in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate was severely reduced even
though activation of p42 Mapk was more sustained in these cells. Thus,
Pages et al. (1999) concluded that p44 Mapk apparently has a specific
role in thymocyte development.

In behavioral tests with mice lacking Erk1, Mazzucchelli et al. (2002)
observed an enhancement of striatum-dependent long-term memory that
correlated with a facilitation of long-term potentiation in the nucleus
accumbens. At the cellular level, ablation of Erk1 resulted in a
stimulus-dependent increase of Erk2 signaling, which Mazzucchelli et al.
(2002) stated was likely due to its enhanced interaction with the
upstream kinase Mek. They concluded that Erk1 has a critical regulatory
role in the long-term adaptive changes underlying striatum-dependent
behavioral plasticity and drug addiction.

A surge of luteinizing hormone (LH; see 152780) from the pituitary gland
triggers ovulation, oocyte maturation, and luteinization for successful
reproduction in mammals. Because the signaling molecules RAS (190020)
and ERK1/2 are activated by an LH surge in granulosa cells of
preovulatory follicles, Fan et al. (2009) disrupted Erk1/2 in mouse
granulosa cells and provided in vivo evidence that these kinases are
necessary for LH-induced oocyte resumption of meiosis, ovulation, and
luteinization. In addition, biochemical analyses and selected disruption
of the Cebpb gene (189965) in granulosa cells demonstrated that
C/EBP-beta is a critical downstream mediator of ERK1/2 activation. Thus,
Fan et al. (2009) concluded that ERK1/2 and C/EBP-beta constitute an in
vivo LH-regulated signaling pathway that controls ovulation- and
luteinization-related events.

Holm et al. (2011) showed that Erk1/2 and Smad2 (601366) are activated
in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome, and both are inhibited by therapies
directed against Tgf-beta (190180). Whereas selective inhibition of
ERK1/2 activation ameliorated aortic growth, Smad4 (600993) deficiency
exacerbated aortic disease and caused premature death in Marfan syndrome
mice. Smad4-deficient Marfan syndrome mice uniquely showed activation of
Jnk1 (601158), and a Jnk antagonist ameliorated aortic growth in Marfan
mice that lacked or retained full Smad4 expression. Thus, Holm et al.
(2011) concluded that noncanonical (Smad-independent) Tgf-beta signaling
is a prominent driver of aortic disease in Marfan syndrome mice, and
inhibition of the ERK1/2 or JNK1 pathways is a potential therapeutic
strategy for the disease.

MITOCHONDRIAL THRRS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases containing a
mitochondrial targeting sequence, Bonnefond et al. (2005) identified
TARS2, which the called mitochondrial THRRS. The deduced 718-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal with a
predicted cleavage site after residue 39. TARS2 has characteristics of a
class II mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and is expected to
function as a dimer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bonnefond et al. (2005) determined that the TARS2 gene contains 18 exons
and spans 19.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bonnefond et al. (2005) mapped the TARS2
gene to chromosome 1.

;;ZF87;;
PUR1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The c-Myc protooncogene (190080) encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein
involved in malignant tumorigenesis. The MYC gene product functions as a
DNA-specific transcription factor. A related polypeptide called MAX
(154950), for MYC-associated factor X, dimerizes with MYC to optimize
DNA binding. A paucity of negative regulatory elements have been
reported for the MYC gene which regulate transcription from 2 initiation
sites specified by the P1 and P2 promoters. ME1a1, a 16-bp nuclear
nuclear factor binding site residing between MYC P1 and P2 transcription
initiation sites, is required for P2 activity. Bossone et al. (1992)
cloned a cDNA encoding a 477-amino acid zinc finger protein, designated
MAZ (MYC-associated zinc finger protein), from a HeLa cell cDNA library
by screening with a concatamerized ME1a1 binding site probe. Its mRNA
was present in all tissues tested (except kidney) as a doublet of
approximately 2.5 to 2.7 kb, along with differentially expressed minor
species. The authors speculated that MAZ may encode a transcription
factor with dual roles in transcription initiation and termination.

Kennedy and Rutter (1992) cloned a full-length cDNA of Pur1 from a mouse
islet cell line. By sequence analysis, they identified MAZ as the human
homolog of mouse Pur1. The deduced hamster, mouse, and human proteins
share approximately 94% sequence identity.

Tsutsui et al. (1996) used Southwestern methods to screen a human
pancreatic islet cell cDNA library for genes encoding proteins that
could bind specifically to the nuclease hypersensitive element of human
c-myc. They identified a gene, named MAZi (for Myc-associated zinc
finger protein of islet), which had a 497-bp open reading frame and was
found to be 99.8% identical to MAZ. The only differences between MAZi
and MAZ were a different 5-prime noncoding region and a shorter
polyalanine tract (11 vs 16 alanines). Thus, MAZi is likely to be a
product of the MAZ gene. However, Tsutsui et al. (1996) reported that
the expression pattern and transcript size of MAZi differed from that of
MAZ. The authors found that a 2.6-kb MAZi transcript was expressed at 5-
to 10-fold higher levels in rat islet carcinoma cells than in normal rat
islet cells and that transfection of islet cells with MAZi resulted in
enhanced expression of a c-myc/reporter construct. The authors suggested
that MAZi may be a positive factor that enhances the expression of c-myc
in islet cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kennedy and Rutter (1992) identified a transcription factor, which they
referred to as Pur1 because of its ability to bind to purine-rich
sequences, from a hamster insulinoma cell line. Such purine-rich
stretches of nucleotides (GAGA boxes) are often found just upstream of
transcription start sites in many genes, including insulin (INS;
176730). Mutation analysis suggested that the GAGA box plays an
important role in transcription of the rat insulin I gene. Kennedy and
Rutter (1992) found that Pur1 binds to the GAGA boxes of the rat insulin
I and II genes and the human islet amyloid polypeptide gene.
Cotransfection experiments showed that Pur1 is a potent transactivator
in both pancreatic and nonpancreatic cells. Pur1 was also found to
stimulate transcription from the intact rat insulin I promoter in HeLa
cells, where the promoter is normally inactive.

Song et al. (1998) showed that both MAZ protein and mRNA levels are
modulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

Gastrin (GAS; 137250) regulates the expression of a variety of genes
involved in the control of acid secretion. It also triggers tissue
response to damage, infection, and inflammation in cells expressing
gastrin receptor (CCKBR; 118445) and, indirectly, in nearby cells via a
paracrine mechanism. Almeida-Vega et al. (2009) found that gastrin
directly induced upregulation of the antiapoptotic regulator PAI2
(SERPINB2; 173390) in CCKBR-positive cells. CCKBR-positive cells also
released IL8 (146930) and prostaglandin E2 into the culture medium in
response to gastrin, which resulted in elevated PAI2 expression in
cocultured CCKBR-negative cells. IL8 signaling in CCKBR-negative cells
upregulated PAI2 via binding of the ASC1 complex (see TRIP4; 604501) to
the PAI2 promoter. Prostaglandin E2 independently upregulated PAI2 via
RHOA (165390)-dependent signaling that induced binding of MAZ to the
PAI2 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that MAZ and the p50 subunit of
the ASC1 complex (ASCC1; 614215) bound directly to sites in the PAI2
promoter. Mutation of the putative MAZ site in the PAI2 promoter reduced
responses to RHOA. Knockdown of the p50 or p65 (TRIP4) subunits of the
ASC1 complex via small interfering RNA significantly reduced PAI2
upregulation in response to gastrin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Song et al. (1998) found that the MAZ gene contains 5 exons and spans
approximately 6 kb. The promoter region has features typical of a
housekeeping gene. The authors identified regulatory elements in the
5-prime flanking sequence that are involved in basal transcription and
in the autoregulation of the MAZ gene by the MAZ protein.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Song et al. (1998, 1998) mapped
the MAZ gene to chromosome 16p11.2, within 1.2 kb of the KNLS4 (603213)
gene.

600702	TITLE *600702 SODIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, TYPE VIII, ALPHA SUBUNIT; SCN8A
;;NAV1.6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-dependent sodium channels, such as SCN8A, are responsible for
the initial membrane depolarization that occurs during generation of
action potentials in most electrically excitable cells (Plummer et al.,
1998).

CLONING

Plummer et al. (1998) isolated and sequenced genomic fragments
containing the exons of a novel human voltage-gated sodium channel
designated SCN8A. SCN8A encodes a 1,980-amino acid protein that shares
close to 99% sequence identity with the mouse protein. It contains
several consensus sites for phosphorylation of serine and threonine
residues that are also conserved in other sodium channel family members.

Plummer et al. (1997) identified 2 alternatively spliced exons of SCN8A,
18N and 18A, that encode transmembrane segments S3 and S4 in domain III.
Exon 18N is expressed in fetal brain and nonneuronal tissues.
Transcripts with exon 18N have a conserved in-frame stop codon that
predicts the synthesis of a truncated, 2-domain protein. The proportion
of transcripts containing exon 18N is highest in mouse fetal brain
between embryonic day (E) 12.5 and E14.5; at E18.5 and later, the 18A
transcript predominates.

GENE STRUCTURE

Plummer et al. (1998) determined that the SCN8A gene contains 28 exons
and identified an additional pair of alternatively spliced exons, 5N and
5A, that encode transmembrane segments of domain I. Exons 5N and 5A
differ by a single amino acid difference at position 7. Plummer et al.
(1998) also found that major and minor protein transcripts are generated
by 2 alternative splice donor sites for exon 10B; the minor transcript
contains 11 extra amino acids.

Drews et al. (2007) identified 4 untranslated 5-prime exons, which they
designated 1a through 1d, in the mouse and human SCN8A genes. These
exons are mutually exclusive, and each is alternatively spliced to the
first coding exon. Exon 1a overlaps with an inserted LINE element, and
the 70-kb interval between the 5-prime noncoding exons and the first
coding exon contains 58% repetitive elements and simple repeats. The
Scn8a genes of lower vertebrates contain only a single 5-prime
untranslated exon that corresponds to mouse and human exon 1c. Exon 1c
contains conserved functional YY1 (600013) and REST (600571) sites.

GENE FUNCTION

Active invasion of the dendritic tree by action potentials generated in
the axon is essential for associative synaptic plasticity and neuronal
ensemble formation. In cortical pyramidal cells, this action potential
back-propagation is supported by dendritic voltage-gated sodium
channels. Using a highly sensitive electron microscopic immunogold
technique, Lorincz and Nusser (2010) revealed the presence of the Nav1.6
subunit in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell proximal and distal dendrites.
Here, the subunit density is lower by a factor of 35 to 80 than that
found in axon initial segments. A gradual decrease in Nav1.6 density
along the proximodistal axis of the dendritic tree was also detected
without any labeling in dendritic spines. Lorincz and Nusser (2010)
concluded that their results revealed the characteristic subcellular
distribution of the Nav1.6 subunit, identifying this molecule as a key
substrate enabling dendritic excitability.

MAPPING

Kohrman et al. (1995) assigned the mouse Scn8a gene to chromosome 15 by
interspecific backcross analysis and the human SCN8A gene to chromosome
12 by hybridization to a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel. Burgess et
al. (1995) mapped the human homolog to 12q13 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. By physical mapping on a YAC contig, Plummer et al.
(1998) localized the SCN8A gene to 12q13.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Because SCN8A is widely expressed in neurons of the central and
peripheral nervous systems, and because mutations in the mouse ortholog
result in ataxia and other movement disorders, Trudeau et al. (2006)
screened the 26 coding exons of SCN8A in 151 patients with inherited or
sporadic ataxia. They found a 2-bp deletion in exon 24 (600702.0001) in
a 9-year-old boy with mental retardation, pancerebellar atrophy, and
ataxia (CIAT; 614306). Three additional family members who were
heterozygous for this mutation exhibited milder cognitive behavioral
deficits including attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD;
143465). No additional occurrence of this mutation was observed in 625
unrelated DNA samples (1,250 chromosomes).

In a girl with infantile epileptic encephalopathy-13 (EIEE13; 614558),
Veeramah et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in the
SCN8A gene (N1768D; 600702.0002). In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutation caused a dominant gain-of-function effect, with
neuronal hyperexcitability, persistent sodium currents, incomplete
channel inactivation, increased spontaneous firing,
paroxysmal-depolarizing-shift-like complexes, and an increased firing
frequency.

Carvill et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous mutation in the SCN8A
gene (L12890V; 600702.0003) in a boy with EIEE13. The mutation was
inherited from his father, who was found to be somatic mosaic for the
mutation. No further clinical information was provided. The patient was
part of a cohort of 500 cases of epileptic encephalopathy who underwent
sequencing of candidate genes; he was the only patient found to carry an
SCN8A mutation.

ANIMAL MODEL

The mouse neurologic mutant 'motor endplate disease' (med) is
characterized by early-onset progressive paralysis of the hindlimbs,
severe muscle atrophy, degeneration of Purkinje cells, and juvenile
lethality. Burgess et al. (1995) isolated a voltage-gated sodium channel
gene, Scn8a, from the flanking region of a transgene-induced allele of
med. Scn8a is expressed in brain and spinal cord but not in skeletal
muscle or heart, and encodes a predicted protein of 1,732 amino acids.
An intragenic deletion at the site of transgene insertion resulted in
loss of expression. The gene is closely related to other sodium channel
alpha subunits: SCN1A (182389), SCN2A (182390), SCN3A (182391), SCN4A
(603967), SCN5A (600163), and SCN6A (182392). Kohrman et al. (1996)
identified a missense mutation in Scn8a that is associated with
cerebellar ataxia in the 'jolting' mutant, a mild allele of the med
locus. Kohrman et al. (1996) described the molecular changes in Scn8a
underlying 2 other spontaneous mutants, med and med(J). The med mutation
was caused by insertion of a truncated LINE element into exon 2 of
Scn8a. The med transcript was spliced from exon 1 to a cryptic acceptor
site in intron 2. In the med(J) allele, a 4-bp deletion within 5-prime
donor site of exon 3 resulted in splicing from exon 1 to exon 4. Both
mutant transcripts altered the reading frame with premature stop codons
close to the N terminus of the protein. Loss of Scn8a expression
resulted in progressive paralysis and early death. Intron 2 of Scn8a is
flanked by minor class AT-AC splice sites. The observed splicing
patterns of the med and med(J) mutant transcripts provided evidence for
preferential in vivo splicing between donor and acceptor sites of the
same class. The apparent functional incompatibility may be a consequence
of the different composition of spliceosomes bound to major and minor
splice sites. The unusual pattern of exon skipping in these mutant
identified Scn8a as a member of a small group of genes containing
introns with nonstandard AT-AC splice sites. AT-AC introns are processed
by alternative splicing machinery that includes U11 and U12 snRNPs.
Meisler et al. (1997) reviewed how the analysis of molecular defects in
mouse mutants can identify candidate genes for human neurologic
disorders, as illustrated by Scn8a among other genes.

Sprunger et al. (1999) studied the mouse mutant med(J), which contains a
splice site mutation in the neuronal sodium channel Scn8a that results
in a very low level of expression. On the C57BL/6J genetic background,
med(J) homozygotes exhibited progressive paralysis and juvenile
lethality. The C3H genetic background had an ameliorating effect,
producing viable adults with a novel dystonic phenotype. The dystonic
mice exhibited movement-induced, sustained abnormal postures of the
trunk and limbs. Sprunger et al. (1999) mapped a dominant modifier locus
responsible for the difference between strains to a 4.5 +/- 1.3-cM
interval on mouse chromosome 3. These findings established a role for
ion channels in dystonia and demonstrated the impact of genetic
background on its severity and progression. This new model suggested to
Sprunger et al. (1999) that SCN8A on 12q13 and SCNM1 (which by
comparative mapping is presumably located on 1p21-q21) may contribute to
human inherited dystonia.

The dystonia demonstrated by Sprunger et al. (1999) in association with
the Scn8a mutation was the first to be related to mutation in an ion
channel. Furthermore, the med(J) mouse differed from other animal models
with dystonia in that the condition persisted to adulthood and was not
associated with neurodegeneration. Sprunger et al. (1999) suggested that
the med(J) mutation should be classified as a hypomorphic allele because
a low level of full-length Scn8a transcripts was demonstrated in
homozygotes, indicating normal splicing at low efficiency. Homozygotes
for null alleles of Scn8a could not survive even in the presence of 2
copies of the Scnm1(H) modifier allele. Thus, prevention of paralysis
and survival to adulthood required both a low level of wildtype
transcript and at least 1 copy of the dominant allele of Scnm1. C57BL/6J
carries a recessive allele of Scmn1 that, in combination with a
hypomorphic level of Scn8a, resulted in paralysis and lethality.

DeRepentigny et al. (2001) described a spontaneous autosomal recessive
mutation in the mouse, which they termed 'degenerating muscle' (dmu),
that is characterized by skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration. Dmu
mice are weak and have great difficulty in moving due to muscle atrophy
and wasting in the hindquarters. Histopathologic observations and
ultrastructural analysis revealed muscle degeneration in both skeletal
and cardiac muscle, but no abnormalities in sciatic nerves. Using
linkage analysis, the authors mapped the dmu locus to the distal portion
of mouse chromosome 15 in a region syntenic to human chromosome 12q13.
The human disorder scapuloperoneal myopathy (SPM; 181430) has been
linked to this region, and SPM patients with associated cardiomyopathy
have been described. Intact transcripts for Scn8a were present in dmu
mice, but their levels were dramatically reduced. Furthermore, genetic
complementation crosses between dmu and med mice revealed that they are
allelic. The authors concluded that at least a portion of the dmu
phenotype may be caused by a downregulation of Scn8a, and that SCN8A is
a candidate gene for human SPM.

Kearney et al. (2002) described a sensitive allele of the unlinked
modifier locus, Scnm1, which results in juvenile lethality in C57BL/6J
mice carrying the med(J) mutation. The modifier acts on the splicing
efficiency of the mutant splice donor site in Scn8a, and mutant mice
display either 90% or 95% reduction in the proportion of correctly
spliced mRNA, depending on modifier genotype. The abundance of the
channel protein, NaV1.6, is also reduced by an order of magnitude in
med(J) mice, resulting in delayed maturation of nodes of Ranvier, slowed
nerve conduction velocity, reduced muscle mass, and reduction of brain
metabolic activity.

Martin et al. (2007) showed that Scn8a(med) and Scn8a(med-jo) mice,
which carry the heterozygous 'jolting' point mutation, were more
resistant to pharmacologically induced seizures than wildtype
littermates, suggesting that altered Scn8a function reduces neuronal
excitability. They also showed that the seizure severity of heterozygous
Scn1a +/- mice (see Yu et al., 2006), which is a mouse model for severe
myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI; 607208), was ameliorated by the
Scn8a(med-jo) allele. Double-heterozygous Scn1a +/- and Scn8a +/(med-jo)
mice had seizure thresholds that were comparable to wildtype
littermates, and the Scn8a(med-jo) allele was also able to rescue the
premature lethality of Scn1a +/- mice and extended the life span of
Scn1a -/- mice. The authors hypothesized that the opposing effects of
Scn1a and Scn8a dysfunction on seizure thresholds result from
differences in the cell types that are influenced by the respective
sodium channel subtypes. Scn1a mutants result in reduced sodium currents
in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons of the hippocampus and cortex,
whereas Scn8a mutants affect excitatory pyramidal cells of the
hippocampus and cortex, suggesting that reduced excitability of these
cells may underlie the elevated seizure resistance of Scn8a-mutant mice.
Martin et al. (2007) suggested that their results demonstrated that
genetic interactions can alter seizure severity, and supported the
hypothesis that genetic modifiers, including the SCN8A gene, contribute
to the clinical variability observed in SMEI and GEFS+.

By ENU-induced mutagenesis screen in mice, Papale et al. (2009)
generated a val929-to-phe (V929F) mutation in the Scn8a gene. This
residue in the pore loop of domain 2 is evolutionarily conserved.
Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed well-defined spike-wave discharges
(SWD), the hallmark of absence epilepsy (see 600131), in
V929F-heterozygous mice and in mice heterozygous for either the
Scn8a(med) or Scn8a(med-jo) mutations. Genetic background had a
significant effect on SWD, with mutants on the C3HeB/FeJ strain showing
a higher incidence than on C57BL/6J. Papale et al. (2009) suggested that
the SCN8A gene may be a candidate gene for absence epilepsy in humans.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT WITH OR WITHOUT CEREBELLAR ATAXIA
SCN8A, 2-BP DEL, 5157CT

In a 9-year-old boy with mental retardation, pancerebellar atrophy, and
ataxia (614306), Trudeau et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a
2-bp deletion in exon 4 of the SCN8A gene, which introduced a
translation termination codon into the pore loop of domain 4, resulting
in removal of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and predicting loss of
channel function (pro1719argfsX6). Three additional heterozygous family
members exhibited milder cognitive and behavioral deficits including
attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 143465). Trudeau et al.
(2006) noted that it was unclear whether the relatives of the proband
had a milder version of the neurologic abnormalities seen in the proband
due to haploinsufficiency for SCN8A, or if the proband's symptoms were
caused by an unrelated developmental disorder.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 13
SCN8A, ASN1768ASP

In a girl with infantile epileptic encephalopathy-13 (EIEE13; 614558),
Veeramah et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous 5302A-G
transition in the SCN8A gene, resulting in an asn1768-to-asp (N1768D)
substitution in a highly conserved residue in the final transmembrane
segment adjacent to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The mutation was
identified by whole-genome sequencing. Expression of the mutant protein
in a neuronal cell line showed that it caused persistent sodium
currents, incomplete channel inactivation, and a depolarizing shift in
the voltage dependence of steady-state fast inactivation. Current-clamp
analysis in rat hippocampal neurons transfected with the mutant protein
showed increased spontaneous firing, paroxysmal-depolarizing-shift-like
complexes, and an increased firing frequency, consistent with a dominant
gain-of-function phenotype. All of these studies were consistent with
neuronal hyperexcitability. Whole-genome sequencing also identified
putative recessive variants in the NRP2 (602070) and UNC13C (614568)
genes in the proband, which may have contributed to the phenotype. The
patient developed refractory generalized seizures at age 6 months. At
age 4 years, the seizure phenotype changed to epileptic spasms, followed
by regression of speech and language skills. She also had developmental
delay, intellectual disability, autism, hypotonia, and difficulties with
coordination and balance. Initial electroencephalogram (EEG) showed
bifrontal spikes and brief bursts of generalized spike-wave activity.
Later EEG showed diffuse slowing, multifocal spikes, and frontally
predominant generalized spikes. Brain MRI was normal. The patient died
suddenly at age 15 years. There was no family history of a similar
disorder.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 13
SCN8A, LEU1290VAL

In a boy with EIEE13 (614558), Carvill et al. (2013) identified a
heterozygous c.3868C-G transversion in the SCN8A gene, resulting in a
leu1290-to-val (L1290V) substitution. The patient had onset of seizures
at age 18 months. The mutation was inherited from the father, who was
found to be somatic mosaic for the mutation.

;;KINESIN 1 HEAVY CHAIN; KNS1;;
KINESIN, HEAVY CHAIN, UBIQUITOUS; UKHC;;
KINH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Kinesins are microtubule-based motor proteins involved in the transport
of organelles in eukaryotic cells. They typically consist of 2
identical, approximately 110- to 120-kD heavy chains, such as KIF5B, and
2 identical, approximately 60- to 70-kD light chains. The heavy chain
contains 3 domains: a globular N-terminal motor domain, which converts
the chemical energy of ATP into a motile force along microtubules in 1
fixed direction; a central alpha-helical rod domain, which enables the 2
heavy chains to dimerize; and a globular C-terminal domain, which
interacts with light chains and possibly an organelle receptor (summary
by Navone et al. (1992) and Niclas et al. (1994)).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on a
conserved region of the Drosophila and squid kinesin heavy chains
(KHCs), Navone et al. (1992) isolated cDNAs encoding KNS1. The predicted
963-amino acid protein has 63% sequence identity to the Drosophila KHC.
Immunoblot analysis using antibodies against squid KHC detected a 120-kD
protein in CV-1 monkey kidney epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence
studies showed that KNS1 expressed in CV-1 cells had both a diffuse
distribution and a filamentous staining pattern that coaligned with
microtubules but not vimentin (VIM; 193060) intermediate filaments; the
KNS1 N- and C-terminal domains, but not the alpha-helical rod domain,
also colocalized with microtubules.

By Northern blot analysis, Niclas et al. (1994) demonstrated that Ukhc
was expressed as multiple transcripts in all rat tissues examined.
Immunoblot analysis of rat tissue extracts using antibodies specific for
UKHC detected a 120-kD protein in all examined tissues. Niclas et al.
(1994) found that UKHC is distributed uniformly between the cell body
and processes of cultured hippocampal neurons.

MAPPING

Niclas et al. (1994) stated that the placenta UKHC cDNA isolated by
Navone et al. (1992) hybridizes to a region on mouse chromosome 18 that
shows homology of synteny with human 18q. However, Gross (2013) mapped
the human KIF5B gene to chromosome 10p11.22 based on an alignment of the
KIF5B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC126279) with the genomic sequence
(GRCh37).

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF5B belongs to the
kinesin-1 family.

GENE FUNCTION

Kamal et al. (2000) demonstrated that the axonal transport of APP in
neurons is mediated by the direct binding of APP to the kinesin light
chain (600025) subunit of kinesin-I. Kamal et al. (2001) identified an
axonal membrane compartment that contains APP, beta-secretase (604252),
and presenilin-1 (104311). The fast anterograde axonal transport of this
compartment is mediated by APP and kinesin-I. Proteolytic processing of
APP can occur in the compartment in vitro and in vivo in axons. This
proteolysis generates amyloid-beta and a carboxy-terminal fragment of
APP, and liberates kinesin-I from the membrane. Kamal et al. (2001)
concluded that APP functions as a kinesin-I membrane receptor, mediating
the axonal transport of beta-secretase and presenilin-1, and that
processing of APP to amyloid-beta by secretases can occur in an axonal
membrane compartment transported by kinesin-I.

Kanai et al. (2004) found that the hinge and C-terminal tail regions of
Kif5a (602821), Kif5b, and Kif5c (604593) bound a large
detergent-resistant RNase-sensitive granule from mouse brain. Mass
spectrometric analysis showed that the granule contained mRNAs for
Camk2-alpha (CAMK2A; 114078) and Arc (NOL3; 605235) and 42 proteins,
including those for RNA transport, protein synthesis, and translational
silencing. The granule localized to dendrites and underwent
bidirectional movement. Distally directed movement of the granule was
enhanced by Kif5 overexpression and reduced by Kif5 functional blockage.
Kanai et al. (2004) concluded that kinesins transport RNA in dendrites
via this large granule.

Kural et al. (2005) used fluorescence imaging with 1-nanometer accuracy
(FIONA) to analyze organelle movement by conventional kinesin and
cytoplasmic dynein (see 600112) in a cell. They located a green
fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged peroxisome in cultured Drosophila S2
cells to within 1.5 nanometers in 1.1 milliseconds, a 400-fold
improvement in temporal resolution, sufficient to determine the average
step size to be approximately 8 nanometers for both dynein and kinesin.
Furthermore, Kural et al. (2005) found that dynein and kinesin do not
work against each other in vivo during peroxisome transport. Rather,
multiple kinesins or multiple dyneins work together, producing up to 10
times the in vitro speed.

To determine the effects of tau (157140) on dynein and kinesin motility,
Dixit et al. (2008) conducted single-molecule studies of motor proteins
moving along tau-decorated microtubules. Dynein tended to reverse
direction, whereas kinesin tended to detach at patches of bound tau.
Kinesin was inhibited at about a tenth of the tau concentration that
inhibited dynein, and the microtubule-binding domain of tau was
sufficient to inhibit motor activity. The differential modulation of
dynein and kinesin motility suggests that microtubule-associated
proteins (MAPs) can spatially regulate the balance of
microtubule-dependent axonal transport.

Metzger et al. (2012) identified the microtubule-associated protein MAP7
(604108) and KIF5B as essential, evolutionarily conserved regulators of
myonuclear positioning in Drosophila and cultured mammalian myotubes.
Metzger et al. (2012) found that these proteins interact physically and
that expression of the KIF5B motor domain fused to the MAP7
microtubule-binding domain rescues nuclear positioning defects in
MAP7-depleted cells. This suggested that MAP7 links KIF5B to the
microtubule cytoskeleton to promote nuclear positioning. Finally,
Metzger et al. (2012) showed that myonuclear positioning is
physiologically important. Drosophila ensconsin (ens; homolog of MAP7)
mutant larvae have decreased locomotion and incorrect myonuclear
positioning, and these phenotypes are rescued by muscle-specific
expression of ens. Metzger et al. (2012) concluded that improper nuclear
positioning contributes to muscle dysfunction in a cell-autonomous
fashion.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Kull et al. (1996) reported the crystal structure of the human kinesin
motor domain with bound ADP. The motor consists primarily of a single
alpha/beta arrowhead-shaped domain. It has striking structural
similarity to the core of the catalytic domain of the actin-based motor
myosin, although kinesin and myosin have virtually no amino acid
sequence identity and exhibit distinct enzymatic and motile properties.

Mori et al. (2007) developed 2 different single-molecule fluorescence
resonance energy transfer sensors to detect whether kinesin is bound to
its microtubule track by 1 or 2 heads. Their FRET results indicated
that, while moving in the presence of saturating ATP, kinesin spends
most of its time bound to the microtubule with both heads. However, when
nucleotide binding becomes rate-limiting at low ATP concentrations,
kinesin waits for ATP in a one-head-bound state and makes brief
transitions to a 2-head-bound intermediate as it walks along the
microtubule. On the basis of these results, Mori et al. (2007) suggested
a model for how transitions in the ATPase cycle position the 2 kinesin
heads and drive their hand-over-hand motion.

Pernigo et al. (2013) presented the crystal structure of the
tetratricopeptide repeat domain of kinesin light chain-2 (611729) in
complex with a cargo peptide harboring a tryptophan-acidic motif derived
from SKIP (609613), a critical host determinant in Salmonella
pathogenesis and a regulator of lysosomal positioning. Structural data
together with biophysical, biochemical, and cellular assays allowed
Pernigo et al. (2013) to propose a framework for intracellular transport
based on the binding by kinesin-1 of W-acidic cargo motifs through a
combination of electrostatic interactions and sequence-specific
elements, providing direct molecular evidence of the mechanisms for
kinesin-1:cargo recognition.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (1998) disrupted the mouse kif5B gene by homologous
recombination. The kif5B -/- mice were embryonic lethal with a severe
growth retardation at 9.5 to 11.5 days postcoitum. To analyze the
significance of this conventional kinesin heavy chain in organelle
transport, the authors studied the distribution of major organelles in
the extraembryonic cells. The null mutant cells impaired lysosomal
dispersion, while brefeldin A could normally induce the breakdown of
their Golgi apparatus. More prominently, their mitochondria abnormally
clustered in the perinuclear region. This mitochondrial phenotype was
reversed by an exogenous expression of KIF5B, and a subcellular
fractionation revealed that KIF5B was associated with mitochondria.
These data indicated that kinesin is essential for mitochondrial and
lysosomal dispersion rather than for the Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum
traffic in these cells.

147572	TITLE *147572 INTERFERON-ALPHA-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN 6; IFI6
;;INTERFERON-INDUCED PROTEIN IFI-6-16; IFI616;;
G1P3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential screening of an alpha-interferon (IFNA; 147660)-induced
neuroblastoma cell cDNA library, followed by screening an IFNA-treated
Daudi lymphoblastoid cell cDNA library, Kelly et al. (1986) cloned IFI6,
which they called 6-16. The deduced 130-amino acid protein is
hydrophobic and contains an N-terminal signal peptide.

GENE FUNCTION

Kelly et al. (1986) showed that IFI6 was induced in HeLa cells by IFNA
and IFNB (147640). Following transfection in mouse cells, human IFI6 was
expressed in response to mouse Ifna and Ifnb, but not Ifng (147570),
with the same kinetics and dose response as in human cells.

Itzhaki and Porter (1991) reported a method for targeted disruption of
the IFI6 gene and detection by secretion of human growth hormone (GH1;
139250).

Cheriyath et al. (2007) showed that treatment of human myeloma cells
with IFN-alpha-2b (see IFNA2; 147562) for 24 hours antagonized TRAIL
(TNFSF10; 603598)-mediated apoptosis, but after 72 hours it augmented
TRAIL apoptotic activity. The antiapoptotic activity of IFN-alpha-2b was
associated with increased expression of G1P3. Ectopically expressed G1P3
localized to mitochondria and antagonized TRAIL-mediated mitochondrial
potential loss, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. Conversely, RNA
interference-mediated downregulation of G1P3 restored
IFN-alpha-2b-induced apoptosis. Cheriyath et al. (2007) concluded that
curtailing G1P3-mediated antiapoptotic signals may improve therapies for
myeloma and other malignancies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kelly et al. (1986) determined that the IFI6 gene contains 5 exons and
has a TATA box upstream of the transcription initiation site.

Porter et al. (1988) described the interferon response element of the
human IFI6 gene.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Clauss et al. (1990) mapped the IFI6
gene to chromosome 1.

Itzhaki et al. (1992) reported that the IFI6 gene maps to chromosome
1p35, based on the work of others using fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Itzhaki et al. (1992) used telomere-associated chromosome
fragmentation (TACF), a novel approach for chromosome mapping based on
the nontargeted introduction of clone telomeres into mammalian
chromosomes, to target telomeric DNA to the IFI6 gene on chromosome 1p.
They deduced that the IFI6 gene is oriented away from the centromere by
targeting telomeric DNA to the specific locus by homologous
recombination, using a selection strategy that imposed the requirement
that the telomeric DNA be oriented in the same direction as the IFI6
gene.

614386	TITLE *614386 PROLINE-RICH TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 2; PRRT2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chen et al. (2011) identified PRRT2 within a region of chromosome 16
linked to the paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia locus (EKD1; 128200).
The deduced 340-amino acid protein has a proline-rich domain in its
N-terminal half and 2 transmembrane domains in its C-terminal half.
RT-PCR of mouse tissues detected high Prrt2 expression in brain and
spinal cord, with negligible expression in all other tissues examined.
Prrt2 expression in mouse was low prior to embryonic day 16, after which
it increased, peaked at postnatal day 14, and declined in adult. RT-PCR
and in situ hybridization of postnatal day-14 mouse brain revealed high
Prrt2 expression in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, with
enrichment in cortical layers of cerebral cortex, as well as in granule
cells and Purkinje cell layers of cerebellum. Fluorescence-tagged PRRT2
was expressed in the membrane of transfected COS-7 cells.

Heron et al. (2012) found that Prrt2 was widely expressed in the mouse
brain, with high expression in the cerebral cortex and lower expression
in the basal ganglia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2011) determined that the PRRT2 gene contains 4 exons, the
first of which is noncoding.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (2011) stated that the PRRT2 gene maps to chromosome
16p11.2.

GENE FUNCTION

In HEK293T cells and brain extracts from mice, Lee et al. (2012)
demonstrated that the PRRT2 protein interacted with SNAP25 (600322), a
synaptosomal membrane. After transfection of PRRT2 into rat hippocampal
cells, PRRT2 was detected in thin axonal processes exiting from the
neuron cell bodies.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 8 unrelated Han Chinese families with episodic
kinesigenic dyskinesia-1 (EKD1; 128200), Chen et al. (2011) identified 3
different heterozygous truncating mutations in the PRRT2 gene
(614386.0001-614386.0003). The first mutation was found by exome
sequencing of a large 4-generation family with 17 affected individuals.
Expression of a truncated form of PRRT2 in COS-7 cells showed loss of
membrane targeting and localization of the truncated protein in the
cytoplasm, suggesting interruption of protein function.

Using a combination of exome sequencing and linkage analysis in 2 large
Han Chinese families with EKD1, Wang et al. (2011) independently and
simultaneously identified 2 different heterozygous truncating mutations
in the PRRT2 gene (649dupC, 614386.0001 and Q163X, 614386.0009,
respectively) that completely segregated with the phenotype in each
family. Two patients in each family also had infantile convulsion and
choreoathetosis syndrome (ICCA; 602066). Analysis of 3 additional Han
Chinese families with EKD1 revealed that 2 carried the 649dupC mutation
and 1 had a different PRRT2 mutation (614386.0010).

Heron et al. (2012) identified heterozygous mutations in the PRRT2 gene
(see, e.g., 614386.0001 and 614386.0004-614386.0006) in 14 (82%) of 17
families with benign familial infantile seizures-2 (BFIS2; 605751), and
in 5 (83%) of 6 families with familial infantile convulsions with
paroxysmal choreoathetosis, a familial syndrome in which infantile
seizures and an adolescent-onset movement disorder, paroxysmal
kinesigenic choreoathetosis (EKD1), cooccur. The 649dupC mutation
(614386.0001) was the most common mutation, found in affected members of
12 families with BFIS2 and in 3 families with ICCA. Overall, the 649dupC
mutation was found in 15 (79%) of the 19 families with ICCA or BFIS2
studied. The families were of different ethnic origin, including
Australasian of western European heritage, Swedish, and Israeli
Sephardic-Jewish, and there was no evidence of a common haplotype among
these families, indicating a mutation hotspot. These findings
demonstrated that mutations in PRRT2 cause both epilepsy and a movement
disorder, with obvious pleiotropy in age of expression.

Lee et al. (2012) also identified heterozygous mutations in the PRRT2
gene (see, e.g., 614386.0007 and 614386.0008) in affected members of
families with ICCA. The mutations were identified by whole-genome
sequencing of 6 well-characterized families. The findings were confirmed
by the identification of PRRT2 mutations in 24 of 25 additional families
with the disorder. The 649dupC mutation was the most common mutation.
Sanger sequencing of a third cohort of 78 probands with a less clear
clinical diagnosis found that 10 patients with familial disease and 17
with sporadic disease had the common 649dupC mutation; 1 additional
patient had a different truncating PRRT2 mutation. None of the
pathogenic alleles were found in over 2,500 control chromosomes. There
was intrafamilial variability of the phenotype. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that the mutant truncating proteins were not
expressed and did not exert dominant-negative effect on the wildtype
protein, suggesting haploinsufficiency as the pathologic mechanism.

Meneret et al. (2012) identified heterozygous mutations in the PRRT2
gene (see, e.g., 614386.0001; 614386.0011-614386.0012) in 22 (65%) of 34
patients of European descent with EKD1 or ICCA. Mutations were found in
13 (93%) of 14 familial cases and in 9 (45%) of 20 sporadic cases. There
was evidence for incomplete penetrance. The most common mutation was
649dupC, which was found in 17 of the 22 patients with PRRT2 mutations,
although this was not due to a founder effect. Compared to patients
without PRRT2 mutations, those with mutations had a slightly earlier age
at onset (median age of 15 years and 9 years, respectively), but
otherwise there were no phenotypic differences between the 2 groups.
Most of the mutations caused premature termination, leading Meneret et
al. (2012) to suggest that the disorders result from PRRT2
haploinsufficiency.

Schubert et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 649dupC mutation in the
PRRT2 gene in 39 of 49 families with BFIS2 and in 1 patient with
sporadic occurrence of the disorder (77% of index cases). Three
additional heterozygous PRRT2 mutations (see, e.g., 614386.0013;
614386.0014) were found in 3 other families with the disorder. The
patients were of German, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish origin. Some of
the families had previously been reported by Striano et al. (2006) and
Weber et al. (2004). The 649dupC mutation, which occurs in an unstable
DNA sequence of 9 cytosines, arose independently in families of
different origin. Some unaffected family members also carried the
mutation, indicating incomplete penetrance.

Ono et al. (2012) identified the 649dupC mutation in 14 of 15 Japanese
families with EKD1, some of whom also had ICCA, and in 2 Japanese
families with BFIS2. The mutation was shown to occur de novo in at least
1 family, suggesting that it is a mutation hotspot. EKD1, ICCA, and
BFIS2 segregated with the mutation even within the same family. The
findings indicated that all 3 disorders are allelic and are likely
caused by a similar mechanism.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Heron and Dibbens (2013) reviewed the role of PRRT2 in 3 common
neurologic disorders, EKD1, ICCA, and BFIS2, noting that there are no
clear genotype/phenotype correlations.

PRRT2, 1-BP DUP, 649C

In affected members of 6 unrelated Han Chinese families with episodic
kinesigenic dyskinesia-1 (EKD1; 128200), Chen et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous 1-bp duplication (649dupC) in exon 2 of the PRRT2 gene in
the proline-rich domain, resulting in a frameshift and introduction of a
stop codon 7 amino acids downstream of the insertion (Arg217ProfsTer8).
The mutation was found by exome sequencing of a large 4-generation
family with 17 affected individuals. The mutation completely segregated
with the phenotype in each family and was not found in unaffected family
members. The mutation was not found in 1,000 Han Chinese controls.
Expression of a truncated form of PRRT2 in COS-7 cells showed loss of
membrane targeting and localization of the truncated protein in the
cytoplasm. A 189-kb common haplotype flanking the mutation was found in
3 of the families, a second different haplotype was found in 2 other
families, and a third haplotype was found in the third family. Clinical
features of the proband of 1 family was described in detail. He had
onset at age 6 years of dystonic posturing of the head and arm, usually
triggered by standing up quickly. This occurred up to 10 times per day,
and lasted about 5 to 10 minutes. Brain MRI and EEG were normal at age 9
years. Treatment with carbamazepine resulted in complete symptom
resolution.

Using a combination of exome sequencing and linkage analysis in a large
Han Chinese family with EKD1, Wang et al. (2011) independently and
simultaneously identified a heterozygous 649dupC mutation in the PRRT2
gene that completely segregated with the phenotype. The mutation was
predicted to result in a truncated protein containing only 223 amino
acids and lacking the transmembrane segment. Two patients in the family
also had infantile convulsion and choreoathetosis syndrome (ICCA;
602066). Analysis of 3 additional Chinese Han families with EKD1
revealed that 2 carried the 649dupC mutation. The mutation was not found
in 500 controls. There was some phenotypic variability: the first family
had dystonia, choreoathetosis or athetosis, the second family had
predominant dystonia of the upper limbs, whereas the third had
predominant dystonia of the lower limbs.

In affected members of 3 unrelated families with familial infantile
convulsions with paroxysmal choreoathetosis, Heron et al. (2012)
identified a heterozygous 649dupC mutation. This heterozygous mutation
was also found in 12 unrelated families with benign familial infantile
seizures-2 (BFIS2; 605751). Overall, the 649dupC mutation was found in
15 (79%) of the 19 families with ICCA or BFIS2 studied. There was no
evidence of a common haplotype among these families. The PRRT2 649dupC
mutation clearly occurs at a mutation hotspot, and occurs in a
homopolymer of 9 C bases adjacent to 4 G bases. This DNA sequence has
the potential to form a hairpin-loop structure, possibly leading to
DNA-polymerase slippage and the insertion of an extra C base during DNA
replication.

Meneret et al. (2012) found that the 649dupC mutation was the most
common mutation in a cohort of patients of European descent with
EKD1/ICCA. The mutation was present in 17 of 22 patients with PRRT2
mutations. Several unaffected family members also carried the mutation,
indicating incomplete penetrance. There were at least 5 different
haplotypes with the mutation, and it was found to occur de novo in 2
patients, indicating that it is a mutation hotspot.

Schubert et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 649dupC mutation in the
PRRT2 gene in 39 of 49 families with BFIS2 and in 1 patient with
sporadic occurrence of the disorder (77% of index cases). The patients
were of German, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish origin. The 649dupC
mutation, which occurs in an unstable DNA sequence of 9 cytosines, arose
independently in families of different origin. Some unaffected family
members also carried the mutation, indicating incomplete penetrance.

Ono et al. (2012) identified the 649dupC mutation in 14 of 15 Japanese
families with EKD1, some of whom also had ICCA, and in 2 Japanese
families with BFIS2. The mutation was shown to occur de novo in at least
1 family, suggesting that it is a mutation hotspot. EKD1, ICCA, and
BFIS2 segregated with the mutation even within the same family. The
findings indicated that all 3 disorders are allelic and are likely
caused by a similar mechanism.

613771	TITLE *613771 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 205; TMEM205
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening for genes upregulated in cisplatin-resistant human cancer
cell lines compared with parental cell lines, Shen et al. (2010) cloned
TMEM205. The deduced 189-amino acid protein has 4 transmembrane domains.
Quantitative real-time PCR detected variable TMEM205 expression in all
29 human tissues examined, with highest expression in pancreas, followed
by adrenal gland, thyroid, liver, mammary gland, prostate, kidney, and
retina. Lowest expression was detected in skeletal muscle. Western blot
analysis detected TMEM205 at an apparent molecular mass of about 21 kD
in membrane fractions of early cisplatin-resistant cells. Immunoelectron
microscopy showed that TMEM205 localized to cell surface microvilli.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses, Shen et al. (2010) confirmed that
expression of TMEM205 was upregulated in cisplatin-resistant human and
mouse cells compared with parental cell lines. Transfection of TMEM205
into naive cells induced cisplatin resistance. Development of cisplatin
resistance was associated with reduced intracellular cisplatin levels
and redistribution of TMEM205 from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi
region. Shen et al. (2010) hypothesized that TMEM205 may be a cisplatin
transporter that permits drug resistance by reducing the intracellular
cisplatin concentration.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the TMEM205 gene to chromosome 19p13.2 based on an
alignment of the TMEM205 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY358949) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;SCD1;;
DELTA-9-DESATURASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD; EC 1.14.99.5) is an iron-containing enzyme
that catalyzes a rate-limiting step in the synthesis of unsaturated
fatty acids. The principal product of SCD is oleic acid, which is formed
by desaturation of stearic acid. The ratio of stearic acid to oleic acid
has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation
through effects on cell membrane fluidity and signal transduction. Four
SCD isoforms, Scd1 through Scd4, have been identified in mouse. In
contrast, only 2 SCD isoforms, SCD1 and SCD5 (608370), have been
identified in human. SCD1 shares about 85% amino acid identity with all
4 mouse SCD isoforms, as well as with rat Scd1 and Scd2. In contrast,
SCD5 shares limited homology with the rodent SCDs and appears to be
unique to primates (Zhang et al. (1999); Wang et al., 2005).

CLONING

Thiede et al. (1986) isolated cDNAs encoding rat Scd. By RT-PCR of
adipose tissue RNA with primers based on the sequence of rat Scd, Li et
al. (1994) isolated a partial human SCD cDNA. Using RNase protection
assays, the authors found that human SCD was expressed at higher levels
in colon and esophageal carcinomas than in the counterpart normal
tissues.

Zhang et al. (1999) cloned additional cDNAs corresponding to the
full-length human SCD transcript, which differed at 15 positions from
that of Li et al. (1994), leading to 6 predicted amino acid changes.
Zhang et al. (1999) reported that the deduced 359-amino acid SCD protein
contains the 3 highly conserved histidine-containing regions that are
essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity. The coding region of
human SCD shares 85% and 82% nucleotide identity with those of mouse
Scd1 and Scd2, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that SCD is
expressed ubiquitously as 3.9- and 5.2-kb mRNAs, with the highest levels
in brain and liver. The 2 transcripts arise from use of alternative
polyadenylation signals.

GENE FUNCTION

By stable expression of SCD antisense cDNA in transformed human lung
fibroblasts, Scaglia and Igal (2005) found that SCD depletion led to
decreased synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids and phospholipids and
promoted accumulation of saturated fatty acid-enriched unesterified
fatty acids and triacylglycerol. Concomitantly, SCD deficiency led to
reduced cell proliferation, loss of anchorage-independent growth, and
increased sensitivity to ceramide-independent apoptosis. Cells
expressing low SCD levels were more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects
of exogenous palmitic acids. Because the effects of SCD deficiency were
not reversed by the addition of exogenous oleic acid, Scaglia and Igal
(2005) concluded that endogenous synthesis of monounsaturated fatty
acids is essential in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis.

Using a mouse model of BCR (151410)/ABL (189980)-induced chronic myeloid
leukemia, Zhang et al. (2012) found that expression of Scd1 was
downregulated in leukemia stem cells. Knockdown of Scd1 in
BCR/ABL-expressing mouse leukemia stem cells downregulated expression of
apoptosis-related genes. Scd1 expression was induced by a PPAR-gamma
(PPARG; 601487) agonist, resulting in reduced proliferation of leukemia
stem cells. Scd1 appeared to have no effect on proliferation or
apoptosis of normal hematopoietic stem cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (1999) demonstrated that the human SCD gene spans
approximately 24 kb and contains 6 exons. They noted that the human,
mouse, and rat SCD genes show similar organizations.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Zhang et al. (1999) mapped
the SCD gene to chromosome 10 and a transcriptionally inactive,
processed SCD pseudogene to chromosome 17.

Wang et al. (2005) stated that the mouse Scd1, Scd2, Scd3, and Scd4
genes map within a 200-kb stretch on chromosome 19 and are likely
derived from tandem duplication events. Since no other SCD genes map to
human chromosome 10, Wang et al. (2005) suggested that a gene
duplication event similar to that resulting in the mouse Scd genes did
not occur in humans.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Suhre et al. (2011) reported a comprehensive analysis of
genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using a GWAS with nontargeted
metabolomics. They identified 37 genetic loci associated with blood
metabolite concentrations, of which 25 showed effect sizes that were
unusually high for GWAS and accounted for 10 to 60% differences in
metabolite levels per allele copy. These associations provided new
functional insights for many disease-related associations that had been
reported in previous studies, including those for cardiovascular and
kidney disorders, type 2 diabetes, cancer, gout, venous thromboembolism,
and Crohn disease. Suhre et al. (2011) identified dbSNP rs603424 in the
SCD gene as associated with myristate/myristoleate ratio with a p value
of 2.9 x 10(-57).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zheng et al. (1999) identified deletions in the Scd1 gene in the asebia
(ab) mutant mouse, which has rudimentary sebaceous glands and develops
alopecia.

Miyazaki et al. (2000) found that asebia (Scd1 -/-) mice had decreased
levels of liver cholesterol esters and triglycerides, despite high
activities of Acat (see ACAT1; 607809) and Gpat (GPAM; 602395), the
enzymes that catalyze synthesis of cholesterol esters and triglycerides,
respectively. Additionally, ad libitum access of Scd1 -/- mice to diets
rich in oleate and palmitoleate did not restore their hepatic
cholesterol esters and triglycerides to the levels found in normal mice.
Miyazaki et al. (2000) concluded that Scd1 has an important role in
cholesterol and lipoprotein homeostasis.

To examine the mechanism underlying the metabolic actions of leptin
(164160), Cohen et al. (2002) used transcription profiling to identify
leptin-regulated genes in ob/ob liver. Leptin was found to specifically
repress RNA levels and enzymatic activity of SCD, which catalyzes the
biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids. Mice lacking Scd1 were lean
and hypermetabolic; ob/ob mice with mutations in Scd1 were significantly
less obese than ob/ob controls and had markedly increased energy
expenditure. Ob/ob mice with mutations in Scd1 had histologically normal
livers with significantly reduced triglyceride storage and VLDL
production. Cohen et al. (2002) concluded that downregulation of Scd1 is
an important component of leptin's metabolic actions.

SCD is a central lipogenic enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of
monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly oleate (C18:1) and palmitoleate
(C16:1), which are components of membrane phospholipids, triglycerides,
wax esters, and cholesterol esters. Several SCD isoforms (Scd1, -2, and
-3) exist in the mouse. Ntambi et al. (2002) showed that mice with a
targeted disruption of the Scd1 isoform had reduced body adiposity,
increased insulin (176730) sensitivity, and resistance to diet-induced
weight gain. The protection from obesity involved increased energy
expenditure and increased oxygen consumption. Compared with wildtype
mice, the Scd1 -/- mice had increased levels of plasma ketone bodies but
reduced levels of plasma insulin and leptin. In these homozygous null
mice, the expression of several genes of lipid oxidation was
upregulated, whereas lipid synthesis genes were downregulated. These
observations suggested that a consequence of Scd1 deficiency is an
activation of lipid oxidation in addition to reduced triglyceride
synthesis and storage.

Miyazaki et al. (2003) found that liver X receptor-alpha (NR1H3; 602423)
agonists and a high carbohydrate fat-free diet induced Scd4 expression
in mice, but unlike Scd1, Scd4 expression was not repressed by dietary
polyunsaturated fatty acids. Scd4 mRNA expression was elevated 5-fold in
the hearts of leptin (164160)-deficient ob/ob mice relative to wildtype
controls. Treatment of ob/ob mice with leptin decreased Scd4 mRNA
levels, but did not affect Scd1 or Scd2 mRNA levels. Scd4 mRNA levels
were induced 3-fold in the hearts of Scd1-deficient mice.

Miyazaki et al. (2005) found that Scd2 expression was high in mouse
livers between embryonic day 18.5 and 21 days of age and decreased in
adult mice. In contrast, Scd1 expression was induced after weaning.
Miyazaki et al. (2005) found that Scd2 knockout was embryonic lethal in
some mice depending upon the genetic background. In a strain able to
tolerate Scd2 deletion, newborn Scd2-null mice were smaller than
wildtype littermates, and a few hours after birth their skin appeared
dry and cracked due to a permeability barrier defect. Mutant skin also
showed repartitioning of linoleic acid from epidermal acylceramide
species into phospholipids. Animals that survived to adulthood had
normal sebaceous glands and hair growth, but they had a twisted tail.

Using antisense Scd1 oligonucleotides, Gutierrez-Juarez et al. (2006)
lowered hepatic Scd1 expression and activity in rats and mice with
diet-induced insulin resistance. Insulin clamp studies revealed severe
hepatic insulin resistance in high fat-fed rats and mice that was
completely reversed by 5 days of treatment with antisense Scd1.
Downregulation of Scd1 in mice also decreased glucose production (by
about 75%), gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis. Downregulation of Scd1
led to increased Akt (AKT1; 164730) phosphorylation and decreased
expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC; 613742) and
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1; 261680). Gutierrez-Juarez et
al. (2006) concluded that Scd1 is required for the onset of diet-induced
hepatic insulin resistance.

Lam et al. (2007) found that intracerebroventricular administration of
glucose in rats lowered circulating triglycerides through inhibition of
VLDL secretion by the liver. The effect of glucose required its
conversion to lactate, leading to activation of ATP-sensitive potassium
channels and to decreased hepatic Scd1 activity. Injection of a
sequence-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide decreased the hepatic
activity of Scd1 and recapitulated the effects of central glucose
administration on VLDL secretion, and portal infusion of oleic acid
negated the effects of both central glucose and Scd1 deficiency on VLDL
secretion. These central effects of glucose, but not those of lactate,
were rapidly lost in diet-induced obese rats. Lam et al. (2007)
suggested that a defect in brain glucose sensing might play a critical
role in the etiology of the metabolic syndrome.

609238	TITLE *609238 RAB GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1-LIKE; RABGAP1L
;;TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 18; TBC1D18;;
KIAA0471
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Seki et al. (1997) cloned RABGAP1L, which they designated
KIAA0471. The transcript contains an Alu element in the 3-prime UTR. The
deduced protein contains 370 amino acids. SDS-PAGE detected RABGAP1L at
an apparent molecular mass of about 50 kD.

Using RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al. (1997) found ubiquitous RABGAP1L
expression. Highest expression was in placenta, liver, kidney, and small
intestine, and lowest expression was in skeletal muscle and spleen.

Hidaka et al. (2000) cloned mouse Rabgap1l, which they designated Hhl.
The deduced 298-amino acid protein contains a PTB domain and shares
homology with the N terminus of human GAPCENA (RABGAP1). Northern blot
analysis detected several Rabgap1l transcripts expressed in a
tissue-specific manner. In situ hybridization of day-14.5 embryos
revealed expression in heart and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

By differential display, Sharma et al. (2003) found that RABGAP1L
expression was upregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas
compared with matched normal esophageal epithelial tissue. In
particular, RABGAP1L expression was upregulated in esophageal tumors
showing nodal invasion.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the RABGAP1L
gene to chromosome 1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Most patients with Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) are considered
sporadic late-onset cases with a complex etiology. By differential
display RT-PCR analysis, De Yebra et al. (2004) found inhibition of
RABGAP1L expression in medial septum and hippocampus in 3 of 6 AD
patients, including 1 with a PSEN1 (104311) mutation.

614983	TITLE *614983 BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, ATF-LIKE 2; BATF2
;;SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIVATOR PROTEIN 1, REGULATED BY INTERFERON; SARI;;
SUPPRESSOR OF AP1, REGULATED BY IFN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BATF2 downregulates cell growth by inhibiting the transcriptional
activity of activator protein-1 (AP1; see 165160), an important
regulator of cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation (Su et al.,
2008).

CLONING

Using differential expression analysis to identify genes upregulated by
interferon (IFN)-beta (147640) in human melanoma cells, Su et al. (2008)
identified BATF2, which they called SARI. The deduced 274-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 29.4 kD. SARI has an
N-terminal basic region, followed by an L-X(6)-L-X(6)-L-X(6)-L motif,
suggesting that it may be a basic leucine zipper-containing
transcription factor. Northern blot analysis of 23 human tissues and
peripheral blood leukocytes detected highest SARI expression in pancreas
and spleen. Expression was moderate in colon, heart, kidney, liver,
lung, and prostate, low in placenta, stomach, small intestine, and
salivary gland, and absent in several tissues, including brain, muscle,
and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Su et al. (2008) found that INF-beta-induced expression of SARI or
overexpression of SARI in AP1-dependent human cancer cell lines
inhibited clonogenic cell growth and anchorage-independent growth and
induced apoptosis. SARI overexpression also inhibited tumor formation by
AP1-dependent DU-145 prostate cancer cells in xenografts in athymic nude
mice. In contrast, overexpression of SARI in normal human cells had no
effect on cell growth or viability. Knockdown of SARI in HeLa cells
abrogated IFN-beta-induced growth inhibition. Using protein interaction
reporter gene assays, Su et al. (2008) found that SARI inhibited
AP1-dependent cell growth by binding to JUN and blocking interaction of
AP1 with DNA, thereby inhibiting AP1-dependent gene expression.

CCN1 (CYR61; 602369) is a secretory integrin-binding protein that
regulates angiogenesis, cell adhesion, migration, proliferation,
survival, and apoptosis. Dash et al. (2010) showed that, by inhibiting
binding of AP1 to the CCN1 promoter, overexpression of SARI reduced CCN1
mRNA and protein expression, which attenuated CCN1-dependent downstream
signaling via ERK (see 176948) and AKT (see 164730)/PI3 kinase (see
601232) pathways.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; 608232) is a common malignancy
characterized by expression of the fused oncogene BCR (151410)-ABL
(189980). BCR-ABL shows constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and
induces growth factor-independent cell growth via several signaling
pathways, including JAK (see 147795)/STAT (see 600555), PI3 kinase/AKT,
and RAS (190020)/MAPK. Huang et al. (2011) showed that SARI expression
was suppressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CML patients
compared with normal controls. Knockdown of BCR-ABL via small
interfering RNA (siRNA) in primary CML cells or K562 myelogenous
leukemia cells upregulated SARI expression. Treatment of cells with
inhibitors of JAK/STAT or RAS/MAPK, but not of PI3 kinase, also resulted
in SARI upregulation. Treatment of K562 cells with siRNA against SARI
decreased apoptosis induced by a BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, suggesting
that SARI inhibits tumor cell growth by promoting apoptosis.

BATF3 (612470) is required for homeostatic development of CD8-alpha
(CD8A; 186910)-positive classical dendritic cells that prime CD8 T-cell
responses against intracellular pathogens. Tussiwand et al. (2012)
identified an alternative, Batf3-independent pathway in mice for
Cd8-alpha-positive dendritic cell development operating during infection
with intracellular pathogens and mediated by the cytokines
interleukin-12 (IL12; 161560) and interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). This
alternative pathway resulted from molecular compensation for Batf3
provided by the related AP1 factors Batf (612476), which also functions
in T and B cells, and Batf2 induced by cytokines in response to
infection. Reciprocally, physiologic compensation between Batf and Batf3
also occurred in T cells for expression of Il10 (124092) and Ctla4
(123890). Compensation among BATF factors was based on the shared
capacity of their leucine zipper domains to interact with non-AP1
factors such as Irf4 (601900) and Irf8 (601565) to mediate cooperative
gene activation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Su et al. (2008) determined that the BATF2 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Su et al. (2008) mapped the BATF2 gene to
chromosome 11q12-q13.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The covalent conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins regulates diverse
cellular pathways and proteins. Ubiquitin is transferred to a target
protein through a concerted action of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme
(E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), such as UBE2T, and a
ubiquitin ligase (E3) (Machida et al., 2006).

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned UBE2T, which they designated HSPC150, from
CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The deduced
197-amino acid protein contains a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme active
site. EST database analysis indicated widespread UBE2T expression.

Machida et al. (2006) found homologs of UBE2T in only vertebrate
databases.

GENE FUNCTION

Machida et al. (2006) found that UBE2T is essential for the Fanconi
anemia pathway for the efficient repair of damaged DNA. UBE2T bound to
the C-terminal PH domain of FANCL (PHF9; 608111), the ubiquitin ligase
subunit of the Fanconi anemia core complex, leading to the
monoubiquitination of FANCD2 (227646). DNA damage in UBE2T-depleted
human osteosarcoma cells led to the formation of abnormal chromosomes
that are a hallmark of Fanconi anemia. Machida et al. (2006) also found
that UBE2T undergoes automonoubiquitination in vivo. This
monoubiquitination was stimulated by the presence of FANCL and
inactivated UBE2T. UBE2T activity was dependent on the conserved cys86,
where a ubiquitin molecule is transferred from E1, and UBE2T underwent
automonoubiquitination at lys91 in vivo. The monoubiquitination of UBE2T
occurred even in the absence of an E3 in vitro. Machida et al. (2006)
concluded that UBE2T is the E2 in the Fanconi anemia pathway and has a
self-inactivation mechanism that could be important for negative
regulation of the pathway.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2000) determined that the UBE2T gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Zhang et al. (2000)
mapped the UBE2T gene to chromosome 1q31.

606132	TITLE *606132 CDC42 EFFECTOR PROTEIN 2; CDC42EP2
;;CEP2;;
BINDER OF RHO GTPases 1; BORG1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDC42 (116952), a small RHO GTPase, regulates the formation of
F-actin-containing structures through its interaction with several
downstream effector proteins. These effectors include the CEPs, also
called the BORGs, all of which contain a CDC42/RAC (602048) interactive
binding (CRIB) motif. The CDC42EP2 gene encodes a CDC42 effector protein
(summary by Hirsch et al., 2001).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen on a mouse embryo cDNA library with TC10
(605857) as the bait, followed by EST database searching, Joberty et al.
(1999) identified cDNAs encoding human and mouse BORG1 (CEP2), BORG2
(CEP3; 606133), BORG3 (CEP5), BORG4 (CEP4; 605468), and BORG5 (CEP1).
Sequence analysis predicted that the 210-amino acid BORG1 protein
contains a CRIB motif followed by a conserved 12-residue BORG homology-1
(BH1) domain in its N terminus; an 11-amino acid BH2 domain in its
central region; and a 22-residue BH3 domain in its C terminus. Northern
blot analysis detected ubiquitous but variable expression of 1.8- and
2.0-kb BORG1 transcripts, with high levels in heart and low levels in
pancreas and liver. By binding analysis, Joberty et al. (1999) confirmed
that BORG1 interacts with TC10 and CDC42. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated cytoplasmic expression of BORG1. BORG1 expression caused no
dramatic changes in cell shape and a reduced abundance of stress fibers.
Coexpression of BORG1 with CDC42 resulted in cells showing a 'porcupine'
phenotype characterized by an abundance of actin-filled spikes.

By EST database searching with CEP1 as the probe, Hirsch et al. (2001)
identified cDNAs encoding several CEPs, including CEP2. They referred to
the BH2 and BH3 domains as CI and CII, respectively, and considered the
BH1 domain to be part of an extended CRIB motif. Hirsch et al. (2001)
proposed that these motifs are potential signaling domains. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated cytoplasmic and membrane expression of CEP2 in
keratinocytes, with notable localization in a perinuclear cytoplasmic
compartment.

MAPPING

Scott (2001) mapped the CEP2 gene to 11q12-q13 based on identity between
the CEP2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF098290) and a chromosome 11 clone
(GenBank GENBANK AC000353).

610701	TITLE *610701 HEAT-SHOCK 70-KD PROTEIN 12A; HSPA12A
;;KIAA0417
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned HSPA12A, which they designated
KIAA0417. The deduced protein contains 710 amino acids. RT-PCR analysis
detected highest HSPA12A expression in brain, followed by kidney,
testis, and ovary. Little to no expression was detected in other tissues
examined. In vitro translated HSPA12A had an apparent molecular mass of
73 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Han et al. (2003) cloned mouse Hspa12a. The deduced 675-amino acid
protein has an atypical HSP70 (see HSPA1A; 140550) ATPase domain, which
is in 2 parts separated by a 66-amino acid spacer region. Han et al.
(2003) identified human HSPA12A by database analysis. The 675-amino acid
human protein shares 96% identity with mouse Hspa12a and 60% identity
with human HSPA12B (610702). Northern blot analysis of human tissues
detected highest expression of a 6.5-kb transcript in brain, with
progressively lower levels in kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart. Mouse
Hspa12a showed a similar expression pattern, but it was not expressed in
skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Han et al. (2003) found that Hspa12a was more highly expressed in
elicited peritoneal macrophages from an atherosclerosis-sensitive mouse
strain than in those from an atherosclerosis-resistant strain, and both
Hspa12a and Hspa12b were preferentially expressed in lesional portions
of aorta. In situ hybridization confirmed that Hspa12a and Hspa12b were
expressed in lesions, but not in normal nonlesional aortic tissue.

GENE STRUCTURE

Han et al. (2003) determined that the HSPA12A gene contains 12 exons and
has a long 3-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the HSPA12A
gene to chromosome 10. Han et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Hspa12a gene
to chromosome 19.

;;SAC DOMAIN-CONTAINING INOSITOL PHOSPHATASE 2; SAC2;;
KIAA0966
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned INPP5F, which they designated
KIAA0966. The transcript contains an Alu element in the 3-prime
untranslated region, and the deduced protein contains 1,132 amino acids.
RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate to high expression in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in whole adult brain, testis, and
ovary, and all specific adult brain regions examined. Whole fetal brain
expressed a somewhat lower level of expression than that found in the
adult brain.

By examining the INPP5F protein sequence, Minagawa et al. (2001)
identified 7 motifs conserved in SAC domain-containing proteins of
different species, including the active site Cx(5)R(T/S) motif in the
sixth motif. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.9-kb transcript in all
human tissues tested, with highest expression in brain, heart, skeletal
muscle, kidney, and placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Minagawa et al. (2001) found that human INPP5F expressed in insect cells
showed 5-phosphatase activity against phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, similar to that of
type II phosphatases. It did not hydrolyze other inositol phosphates.
High activity was maintained between pH 5.5 and 8.0, with maximal
activity at pH 6.0. Activity was increased in the presence of Mg(2+) and
K+, but not Mn(2+), Ca(2+), or EDTA.

MAPPING

The Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the INPP5F gene to
chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-22037).

606615	TITLE *606615 HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR 1-ALPHA INHIBITOR; HIF1AN
;;HIF1A INHIBITOR;;
FACTOR-INHIBITING HIF1A; FIH1
DESCRIPTION Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activates transcription of genes whose
protein products either increase oxygen availability by promoting
erythropoiesis (see EPO; 133170) and angiogenesis (see VEGF; 192240) or
mediate adaptive responses to oxygen deprivation, such as increased
glycolytic metabolism. HIF1A (603348), whose expression is regulated by
cellular oxygen concentration, is part of a heterodimer with the
constitutively expressed HIF1B (ARNT; 126110). The C-terminal half of
HIF1A contains multiple regulatory domains that interact with specific
proteins, such as VHL (608537).

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library with
transactivating domain C (TAD-C) and the inhibitory domain of HIF1A as
bait, Mahon et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding HIF1AN, which they
designated FIH1. EST database analysis suggested that HIF1AN is
expressed in multiple cell types. The deduced 349-amino acid HIF1AN
protein is homologous to rat Pass1 and to fly and worm sequences,
indicating evolutionary conservation of this protein family.

GENE FUNCTION

By binding analyses of truncated HIF1AN peptides, Mahon et al. (2001)
showed that the inhibitory domain rather than the transactivating
domains of HIF1A interacts with HIF1AN, although the presence of TAD-C
optimizes binding. Functional analysis indicated that HIAF1AN inhibits
HIF1A transcriptional activity in hypoxic and nonhypoxic cells. Further
binding analysis determined that the N terminus of HIF1AN interacts with
the N terminus of VHL, and that both interact with HIF1A at distinct
sites (VHL with TAD-N of HIF1A), allowing the formation of ternary
complexes of the 3 proteins. VHL, but not HIF1AN, interacts with and
recruits HDAC1 (601241), HDAC2 (605164), and HDAC3 (605166) to HIF1A,
thus functioning as a HIF1A corepressor. Mahon et al. (2001) proposed
that HIF1AN may instead interact, either directly or indirectly, with
other functionally and structurally distinct histone deacetylases.

Using mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Hoff et al.
(2013) found that the ciliary proteins ANKS6 (615370), NPHP3 (608002),
INVS (243305), and NEK8 (609799) interacted in a complex. ANKS6 also
interacted with HIF1AN (606615). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments
showed that HIF1AN facilitated formation of a complex containing rat
Anks6 and human NPHP3 and INVS. Association of rat Anks6 with human NEK8
required hydroxylation of Anks6. Hoff et al. (2013) concluded that
oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of ANKS6 by HIF1AN regulates the
composition of the ANKS6-containing ciliary complex.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Mahon et al. (2001) determined that the
HIF1AN gene contains 8 exons and spans 14 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Mahon et al. (2001) mapped the HIF1AN gene
to chromosome 10q24, a region deleted in gliomas in which increased
HIF1A-mediated transactivation of downstream genes, such as VEGF,
occurs.

601572	TITLE *601572 CAPPING PROTEIN, BETA; CAPZB
;;CAP PROTEIN, ACTIN, BETA; CAPPB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CapZ was identified in chicken as an actin-binding protein composed of
alpha (see 601580) and beta subunits. From a human retina cDNA library,
Barron-Casella et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs homologous for the beta
subunit of chicken CapZ.

MAPPING

Barron-Casella et al. (1995) mapped the CAPZB gene to chromosome 1p36.1
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

HISTORY

In the course of mapping 39 ESTs on chromosome 6p24-p23, Olavesen et al.
(1997) concluded that CAPZB is located in that region flanked by EDN1
(131240) on the centromeric side and TFAP2 (107580) on the telomeric
side. However, Cooper (1999) stated that a 'simple clerical error'
occurred at the outset of this project; the EST in question does not
share sequence similarity with the CAPZB gene and, therefore, the
mapping of the CAPZB gene to chromosome 6p24-p23 is incorrect.

;;1-@PYRROLINE-5-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHETASE; PYCS;;
P5CS;;
GLUTAMATE GAMMA-SEMIALDEHYDE SYNTHETASE; GSAS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) catalyzes the ATP- and
NADPH-dependent conversion of L-glutamate to glutamic
gamma-semialdehyde, which is the metabolic precursor for proline
biosynthesis.

CLONING

By a method they referred to as 'database cloning,' Aral et al. (1996)
isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding the human P5CS gene.

Hu et al. (1999) observed that mammalian P5CS undergoes alternative
splicing to generate 2 isoforms differing only by a 2-amino acid insert
at the N terminus of the gamma-glutamyl kinase active site. The short
isoform has high activity in the gut, where it participates in arginine
biosynthesis and is inhibited by ornithine. The long isoform, expressed
in multiple tissues, is necessary for the synthesis of proline from
glutamate and is insensitive to ornithine.

MAPPING

Jones (1975) presented evidence from cell hybrid studies that the
structural gene for the enzyme converting glutamate to its gamma
semialdehyde is located on chromosome 10. The fact that
glutamate-gamma-semialdehyde synthetase (GSAS) and glutamate
oxaloacetate transaminase (138180) are in the same biochemical pathway
and determined by genes on the same chromosome may have biologic
significance (Jones, 1975).

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Liu et al. (1996) mapped the PYCS
gene to 10q24.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Baumgartner et al. (2000) observed homozygosity for a missense mutation
in P5CS in the 2 sibs described by Rabier et al. (1992) with mental
retardation, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, cataract, and
metabolic abnormalities, including hyperammonemia, hypoprolinemia,
hypocitrullinemia, and hypoornithinemia (ARCL3A; 219150). The
arg84-to-gln mutation (R84Q; 138250.0001) alters a conserved residue in
the P5CS gamma-glutamyl kinase domain and dramatically reduces the
activity of both P5CS isoforms when expressed in mammalian cells.
Additionally, R84Q appears to destabilize the long isoform.

In affected individuals from a New Zealand family with mental
retardation, joint hypermobility, and skin laxity without metabolic
abnormalities, Bicknell et al. (2008) identified a homozygous mutation
in the ALDH18A1 gene (H784Y; 138250.0002). In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the H784Y mutant protein retained
normal P5CS activity and did not impair proline synthesis. The findings
indicated that impaired enzymatic activity does not account for the
phenotype, as was suggested for the patients reported by Baumgartner et
al. (2000).

Skidmore et al. (2011) reported a child born of a consanguineous union
with features consistent with De Barsy syndrome (ARCL3A) with homozygous
mutation in the ALDH18A1 gene (138250.0003).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA

Baumgartner et al. (2000) determined that the 2 sibs reported by Rabier
et al. (1992) with mental retardation, joint hypermobility, skin laxity,
cataracts, and metabolic abnormalities (219150) were homozygous for a
251G-A transition of the PYCS gene, resulting in an arg84-to-gln (R84Q)
substitution. The mutation impairs the function of both the long and
short isoforms of PYCS.

.0002
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, HIS784TYR

In 4 affected sibs, born of consanguineous New Zealand Maori parents,
with mental retardation, joint hypermobility, skin laxity without
metabolic abnormalities (219150), Bicknell et al. (2008) identified a
homozygous 2350C-T transition in exon 18 of the ALDH18A1 gene, resulting
in a his784-to-tyr (H784Y) substitution in a conserved residue in the
C-terminal motif. In vitro functional expression studies indicated that
the H784Y-mutant protein retained normal P5CS activity and did not
impair proline synthesis. The findings indicated that impaired enzymatic
activity does not account for the phenotype.

.0003
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, NT1923, G-A, +1

In a severely affected child with clinical features consistent with De
Barsy syndrome (219150), born to consanguineous parents of Pakistani
origin, Skidmore et al. (2011) reported homozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the exon 14-intron 14 boundary (nucleotide 1923+1) of the
ALDH18A1 gene. The mutation resulted in 2 anomalous transcripts that
were predicted to encode proteins lacking the catalytic site for the
enzyme. The cellular phenotype was characterized by diminished
production of collagens type I (see 120150) and III (see 120180),
altered elastin ultrastructure, and diminished cell proliferation of
cultured dermal fibroblasts. The child had lax, wrinkled, and thin skin
with dilated and tortuous subcutaneous blood vessels, corneal clouding,
and hypotonia. The child also had severe global developmental delay and
feeding difficulties, and died in infancy of unknown causes.

602409	TITLE *602409 MYELOID/LYMPHOID OR MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA, TRANSLOCATED TO, 10; MLLT10
;;ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 10; AF10
AF10/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
AF10/HEAB FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Translocations affecting chromosome 11q23 involve many partner
chromosome regions and occur in various leukemias (see 600328). The
11q23 gene involved in the translocations is MLL (159555). Using RACE to
identify MLL fusion transcripts in RNA from 2 leukemia patients, Chaplin
et al. (1995) identified the partner gene involved in t(10;11)(p12;q23)
translocations. In both patients, the translocation fused MLL to a gene
that the authors designated AF10. The AF10 gene encodes a predicted
1,027-amino acid protein containing an N-terminal zinc finger and a
C-terminal leucine zipper domain that are highly homologous to similar
domains in AF17 (600328) and BR140 (602410). Northern blot analysis
showed that AF10 is expressed as a 5.5-kb mRNA in many tissues with
highest expression in testis, and has an alternatively spliced exon.

GENE FUNCTION

The AF10 gene is one of the few MLL partner genes to be independently
rearranged with a third gene in leukemia, the CALM gene (603025) in the
t(10;11)(p12;q14) translocation (Dreyling et al., 1996). Chimeric fusion
proteins MLL/AF10 and CALM/AF10 consistently retain the leucine zipper
motif of AF10. Debernardi et al. (2002) used this part of the C-terminal
region as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screening of a testis cDNA library.
They found that the leucine zipper interacted with GAS41 (602116), a
protein previously identified as the product of an amplified gene in a
glioblastoma. GAS41 shows significant homology to the human MLL fusion
partners AF9 (159558) and ENL (159556). The study also showed that GAS41
interacts with integrase interactor-1 (INI1; 601607) and that INI1 is a
component of the SWI/SNF complex (see 604958), which acts to remodel
chromatin and to modulate transcription. Retention of the leucine zipper
in the MLL and CALM fusions suggested that a key feature of these
chimeric proteins may be their ability to interfere in normal gene
regulation through interaction with the adenosine triphosphate-dependent
chromatin remodeling complexes.

MAPPING

Chaplin et al. (1995) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
AF10 gene to 10p12.

CYTOGENETICS

- AF10/MLL Fusion Gene

Chaplin et al. (1995) found that all known translocations involving MLL
and AF10 or AF17 have involved breakpoints between the zinc finger and
leucine zipper domains, and have yielded fusion proteins in which the
MLL zinc fingers were replaced with leucine zipper regions. Chaplin et
al. (1995) speculated that the fusion proteins may participate in
abnormal heterodimers.

- AF10/HEAB Fusion Gene

Tanabe et al. (1996) identified an invins(10;11)(p12;q23q12) and other
complex chromosomal rearrangements in a 2-year old boy with acute
monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5). Cloning of the proximal 10p breakpoint
showed that the MLL gene at chromosome 11q23 was fused to the 3-prime
portion of AF10 at chromosome 10p12. Cloning of the telomeric 10p
junction revealed that the 5-prime portion of AF10 was fused with the
HEAB gene (608757). The 5-prime AF10/HEAB fusion transcript was out of
frame, while the MLL/3-prime AF10 transcript was in frame.

MLLT10 gene and susceptibility to meningioma, see 607174.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterases (EC 3.1.2.2), such as ACOT7, are found
in all organisms and cleave fatty acyl-CoAs into free fatty acids and
CoA.

CLONING

Engberg et al. (1997) purified a liver cytosolic isoform of long-chain
acyl-CoA thioesterase from peroxisome proliferator-treated rats and
named it CTE-II for 'cytosolic long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase.'
Antibodies against CTE-II were used to screen an expression library of
peroxisome proliferator-induced rat liver cDNA. The predicted 338-amino
acid protein migrated at 40 kD on SDS-PAGE. Engberg et al. (1997)
observed many evenly distributed nucleotide differences and pronounced
differences in the C-terminal regions between CTE-II and the closely
related ACT (602586) and suggested that the 2 enzymes are encoded by
different genes. Engberg et al. (1997) noted that there are human ESTs
homologous to CTE-II.

Yamada et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs encoding long-chain acyl-CoA
hydrolases from rat brain and liver cDNA libraries and designated the
clones Bach and Lach, respectively. Since the nucleotide sequences of
the N-terminal regions were entirely different but the downstream
sequences were virtually identical, Yamada et al. (1997) suggested that
Bach and Lach are derived from the same gene by alternative splicing.

Using a rat Bach cDNA to screen a human brain cDNA library, Yamada et
al. (1999) cloned BACH. The deduced protein contains 338 amino acids and
shares 95% identity with rat Bach. Northern blot analysis detected a
1.9-kb BACH transcript in human brain RNA. Biochemical analysis of human
brain homogenates showed that BACH is a cytosolic enzyme. SDS-PAGE
detected BACH at 43 kD, but gel filtration detected BACH at about 100
kD, indicating that the protein forms multimers.

By 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR of human brain total RNA, Yamada et al.
(2002) identified 6 BACH splice variants. Four variants, designated
BACHa to BACHd, differ in their use of 1 of 4 alternate first exons
(exons 1a through 1d, respectively) and encode proteins of 329 to 380
amino acids. All 4 of these proteins contain the hydrolase domain and a
bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in their C-terminal halves,
and BACHb and BACHc have N-terminal mitochondrial localization signals.
The 2 remaining variants contain exon X, an alternatively spliced exon
between exons 7 and 8 that causes a frameshift and introduces a
premature stop codon. These C-terminally truncated proteins of 246 and
283 amino acids lack the hydrolase domain and NLS. The BACH proteins
containing the mitochondrial localization signal were detected in
mitochondria of transfected mouse neuroblastoma cells, but those
containing only the NLS did not localize to nuclei, even though the
isolated NLS was functional when fused to a test protein.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human brain detected BACHa in the
cytosol of neurons such as pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and
Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. In mouse brain, Bacha was also
detected in nuclei as well as cytosol of certain large neurons in the
cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. Yamada et al. (2002)
suggested that the NLS of BACH may be masked by the full-length protein
as a regulatory mechanism.

GENE FUNCTION

Yamada et al. (1997) found that bacterial extracts of E. coli expressing
either rat Bach or Lach cDNAs had 100-fold higher acyl-CoA hydrolase
activity, demonstrating that both cDNAs encode long-chain acyl-CoA
hydrolases.

By analyzing the activity of purified BACH against several fatty
acyl-CoAs, Yamada et al. (1999) found that BACH showed a relatively
broad specificity, with acyl-CoAs with carbon chains of C8 to C18 being
good substrates. BACH activity was inhibited by a sulfhydryl blocking
agent. Recombinant BACH was also active against palmitoyl-CoA.

Yang et al. (2004) found significantly decreased levels of acyl-CoA
hydrolase in hippocampal tissue from 5 patients with mesial temporal
lobe epilepsy (608096) compared to controls.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yamada et al. (2002) determined that the ACOT7 gene contains 13 exons,
including 4 alternative first exons (exons 1a through 1d) and exon X, an
alternatively spliced exon between exons 7 and 8. The gene spans 129 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Yamada et al. (1999) mapped the ACOT7 gene
to chromosome 1p36.2. Hunt et al. (2005) stated that the human ACOT7
gene maps to chromosome 1p36.31-p36.11 and the mouse Acot7 gene maps to
chromosome 4E2.

NOMENCLATURE

Hunt et al. (2005) noted that acyl-CoA thioesterases are referred to in
the literature as acyl-CoA hydrolases, but the reaction catalyzed is the
cleavage of a thioester bond. They presented a revised nomenclature for
these enzymes using the name acyl-CoA thioesterase and the root gene
symbol ACOT.

600756	TITLE *600756 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-PRIME; PPP2R4
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A, REGULATORY SUBUNIT B-PRIME;;
PHOSPHOTYROSYL PHOSPHATASE ACTIVATOR; PTPA;;
PR53
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PPP2R4, or PTPA, encodes a specific phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator
of the dimeric form of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) (Van
Hoof et al., 1995).

GENE FUNCTION

The core component of PP2A consists of a catalytic (C) subunit (e.g.,
PPP2CA; 176915) and a scaffold protein (A) subunit (e.g., PPP2R1A;
605983). Using purified recombinant proteins, Chao et al. (2006) found
that PTPA and PP2A A-C dimers constituted a composite ATPase, and the
interaction was independent of ATP or magnesium ion. The inclusion of
PTPA altered the substrate specificity of PP2A, with enhanced
phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity and decreased phosphoserine
phosphatase activity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Chao et al. (2006) reported the 1.9-angstrom crystal structure of human
PTPA, which revealed a fold consisting of a core, a lid, and an extended
linker joining the core and lid. Structural analysis uncovered a highly
conserved surface patch bordering these 3 subdomains, as well as an
associated deep pocket between the core and linker subdomains. Further
analysis showed that the surface patch binds the PP2A A-C dimer, and the
deep pocket binds ATP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van Hoof et al. (1995) demonstrated that human PTPA is encoded by a
single-copy gene composed of 10 exons and 9 introns with a total length
of about 60 kb. The 5-prime flanking sequence of the transcription start
site was analyzed for its potential as a promoter. This region lacks a
TATA sequence in the appropriate position relative to the transcription
start. However, this region is very GC-rich and contains 4 Sp1 sites
(SP1; 189906) upstream of the transcription start site, a feature common
to many TATA-less promoters. Based on homology with DNA-binding
consensus sequences of transcription factors, Van Hoof et al. (1995)
identified several additional putative transcription factor binding
sites in the promoter region. Transfection experiments with a construct
containing the PTPA promoter region inserted 5-prime of a luciferase
reporter gene demonstrated that the 5-prime flanking sequence of the
PTPA gene indeed has promoter activity that seems to be cell-line
dependent.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Van Hoof et al. (1995) mapped the
PTPA gene to 9q34. Fluorescence in situ analysis of metaphase
chromosomes of patients bearing the Philadelphia chromosome indicated
that PTPA is positioned centromeric of ABL1 (189980) and probably is not
involved in chronic myeloid leukemia.

609433	TITLE *609433 UBIQUITIN INTERACTION MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; UIMC1
;;RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 80-KD; RAP80
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display of RNA expressed by young proliferating and
senescent normal human epidermal keratinocytes, followed by screening a
testis cDNA library, Yan et al. (2002) cloned RAP80. The deduced
719-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 79.6 kD. The
N-terminal half of RAP80 contains 2 nuclear localization signals and a
putative ubiquitin interaction motif. The C-terminal half contains a
potential PEST sequence, 2 zinc fingers, and a third nuclear
localization signal. Northern blot analysis detected a major 2.6-kb
transcript expressed highly in testis and moderately in ovary, thymus,
and heart. In situ hybridization of mouse testis detected Rap80
associated with germ cells, with little expression in surrounding Leydig
cells. No significant differences in the level of Rap80 were found
between developmental subpopulations of germ cells, suggesting that
Rap80 expression is not developmentally regulated. Immunofluorescence
localization detected RAP80 in a speckled nuclear distribution in a
transfected monkey kidney cell line, and mutation analysis indicated
that the second nuclear localization signal directed intracellular
localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Yan et al. (2002) found that RAP80 decreased basal transcription of a
reporter gene in transfected Chinese hamster ovary and monkey kidney
cell lines. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis indicated that RAP80 could interact
with the retinoid-related testis-associated receptor (RTR; 602778), but
not with retinoid receptors (see RXRA; 180245) or other nuclear
receptors tested. Cotransfection experiments showed that RAP80 and RTR
interacted with each other in a dose-dependent manner. Mutation analysis
indicated that several regions of RAP80 were important for optimal
interaction with RTR. RAP80 inhibited the interaction of NCOR (600849)
with RTR in a concentration-dependent manner, and RAP80 and NCOR
appeared to compete with each other for RTR binding.

Wang et al. (2007) showed that Abraxas (ABRA1; 611143), a protein that
binds BRCA1 (113705), recruits the ubiquitin-interacting motif
(UIM)-containing protein RAP80 to the BRCA1 complex. Both Abraxas and
RAP80 were required for DNA damage resistance, G2/M checkpoint control,
and DNA repair. RAP80 was required for optimal accumulation of BRCA1 on
damaged DNA (foci) in response to ionizing radiation, and the UIM
domains alone were capable of foci formation. Wang et al. (2007)
concluded that the RAP80-Abraxas complex may help recruit BRCA1 to DNA
damage sites in part through recognition of ubiquitinated proteins.

Sobhian et al. (2007) reported the interaction of the BRCT (BRCA1
C-terminal) BRCA1 domain with the ubiquitin-binding protein RAP80. RAP80
targets a complex containing the BRCA1-BARD1 (601593) E3 ligase and the
deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC36 (300617) to MDC1 (607593)-gamma-H2AX
(601772)-dependent lys6- and lys63-linked ubiquitin polymers at
double-strand breaks. Sobhian et al. (2007) stated that these events are
required for cell cycle checkpoint and repair responses to ionizing
radiation, implicating ubiquitin chain recognition and turnover in the
BRCA1-mediated repair of double-strand breaks.

Kim et al. (2007) independently reported the identification of AP80 as a
BRCA1-interacting protein in humans. RAP80 contains a tandem UIM domain,
which is required for its binding with ubiquitin in vitro and its
damage-induced foci formation in vivo. Moreover, Kim et al. (2007)
showed that RAP80 specifically recruits BRCA1 to DNA damage sites and
functions with BRCA1 in G2/M checkpoint control. Kim et al. (2007)
concluded that taken together, their results suggested the existence of
a ubiquitination-dependent signaling pathway involved in the DNA damage
response.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yan et al. (2002) determined that the RAP80 gene contains 15 exons and
spans more than 90 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Yan et al. (2002) mapped the UIMC1 gene to chromosome 5q35.

;;ICOS LIGAND; ICOSL; LICOS;;
B7 HOMOLOG 2; B7H2;;
GL50;;
B7-RELATED PROTEIN 1; B7RP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The costimulatory B7 molecules (e.g., B7-1, or CD80; 112203) signal
through CD28 (186760) family molecules, such as CD28, CTLA4 (123890),
and ICOS (604558). By searching sequence databases for human homologs of
the mouse B7-like gene Gl50, Ling et al. (2000) identified a brain cDNA,
KIAA0653 (Ishikawa et al., 1998), containing similar as well as
unrelated sequences. Using 3-prime RACE analysis of peripheral blood
leukocytes (PBLs) and RT-PCR of leukocyte RNA, Ling et al. (2000)
isolated a cDNA encoding a 309-amino acid human B7 homolog, which they
termed GL50, that is 42% identical to the mouse sequence. Northern blot
analysis detected highest expression of 2.4-, 3.0-, and 7.0-kb
transcripts in brain, heart, kidney, and liver, with lower expression in
colon and thymus. A 1.1-kb transcript was also detected in PBLs.

Yoshinaga et al. (2000) also cloned GL50, which they termed B7RP1.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 302-amino acid protein contains a
transmembrane domain and 5 conserved cysteine residues.

Wang et al. (2000) also cloned this gene, which they termed B7H2.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 302-amino acid type I glycoprotein
is 21% identical to B7H1 (605402).

GENE FUNCTION

By flow cytometric analysis, Ling et al. (2000) demonstrated that mouse
Gl50 binds to Icos but not to Ctla4 or Cd28.

BIAcore analysis by Yoshinaga et al. (2000) indicated that B7RP1 binds
preferentially to ICOS and does not bind to CTLA4. Flow cytometric
analysis demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (191160) enhances
B7RP1 expression on B cells and monocytes, but decreases its expression
on dendritic cells. B7RP1 fusion protein or cells expressing B7RP1
enhanced T-cell proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680)-dependent
cytokine production (gamma-interferon (147570) and IL10 (124092) but not
IL2) in response to anti-CD3 (see 186740) stimulation. This enhancement
could be blocked by soluble ICOS.

Flow cytometric analysis by Wang et al. (2000) demonstrated enhanced
B7H2 surface expression on dendritic cells stimulated with
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF; 138960) and IL4
(147780), but not on those stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Wang et
al. (2000) found that B7H2 costimulation enhances production of IL10 and
IL2 but that this varies with anti-CD3 concentration.

In mice, Xu et al. (2013) showed that Icos directly controls follicular
recruitment of activated T-helper cells in mice. This effect is
independent from ICOS ligand (ICOSL)-mediated costimulation provided by
antigen-presenting dendritic cells or cognate B cells, and does not rely
on Bcl6 (109565)-mediated programming as an intermediate step. Instead
it requires ICOSL expression by follicular bystander B cells, which do
not present cognate antigen to T-helper cells but collectively form an
ICOS-engaging field. Dynamic imaging revealed that Icos engagement
drives coordinated pseudopod formation and promotes persistent T-cell
migration at the border between the T-cell zone and the B-cell follicle
in vivo. When follicular bystander B cells could not express Icosl,
otherwise competent T-helper cells failed to develop into follicular
T-helper cells normally, and failed to promote optimal germinal center
responses. Xu et al. (2013) concluded that these results demonstrated a
costimulation-independent function of ICOS and uncovered a key role for
bystander B cells in promoting the development of follicular T-helper
cells.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the ICOSLG
gene, which they called KIAA0653, to chromosome 21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mak et al. (2003) generated Icosl -/- mice by deleting the region of
Icosl encoding the IgV loop. These otherwise healthy and fertile mice
had reduced IgG1 production and affinity maturation, indicating a defect
in T cell-dependent responses. The Icosl -/- mice also had impaired T-
and B-cell interaction and germinal center formation. Adoptive transfer
experiments demonstrated that costimulation through Icos-Icosl is
pivotal in the primary, but not the secondary, phase of helper T-cell
responses. Using a model of allergic airway disease, Mak et al. (2003)
also observed lower IgE production and decreased recruitment of
inflammatory cells to the lung.

Gajewska et al. (2005) found that B7rp1-deficient mice developed airway
eosinophilia and Th2 responses, as assessed by the pattern of cytokine
and Ig production, following aerosolized ovalbumin challenge. In
addition, B7rp1-deficient mice did not develop inhalation tolerance.
Gajewska et al. (2005) concluded that the ICOS-B7RP1 pathway is
redundant for generation of Th2 responses, but it is required for
induction of inhalation tolerance.

103180	TITLE *103180 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 1; ARF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), such as ARF1, are small guanine
nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the enzymatic activities of
cholera toxin. ARFs are essential and ubiquitous in eukaryotes, being
involved in vesicular transport and functioning as activators of
phospholipase D. The functions of ARF proteins in membrane traffic and
organelle integrity are intimately tied to their reversible association
with membranes and specific interactions with membrane phospholipids. A
common feature of these functions is their regulation by the binding and
hydrolysis of GTP (summary by Bobak et al. (1989) and Amor et al.
(1994)).

CLONING

Bobak et al. (1989) cloned 2 ARF cDNAs, ARF1 and ARF3 (103190), from a
human cerebellum library. Based on deduced amino acid sequences and
patterns of hybridization of cDNA and oligonucleotide probes with
mammalian brain poly(A)+ RNA, human ARF1 is the homolog of bovine ARF1.
Human ARF3, however, appeared to represent a newly identified, third
type of ARF, which differs from bovine ARF1 and bovine ARF2. Peng et al.
(1989) also reported cloning of ADP-ribosylation factor.

Lee et al. (1992) found that human ARF1 is identical to its bovine
counterpart, has a distinctive pattern of tissue and developmental
expression, and is encoded by an mRNA of approximately 1.9 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Coatomer, or COPI (see 601924), is a heptameric protein recruited to
membranes by ARF1. Coat assembly helps in the transport of budding off
membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus.
Using fluorescence microscopy, Presley et al. (2002) showed that guanine
nucleotide exchange-activated ARF1 at the Golgi membrane recruits and
binds cytoplasmic COPI to the membranes. Photobleaching experiments
demonstrated that COPI remains at the membranes after ARF1-GTP has been
hydrolyzed by ARFGAP1 (608377). COPI binds to membrane cargo,
soluble-cargo receptors, or other Golgi proteins. Uncoating, or the
release of COPI from Golgi membranes to the cytoplasm, then occurs,
which can be inhibited by aluminum fluoride. Presley et al. (2002)
concluded from their kinetic and biochemical analyses that COPI and ARF1
continuously bind and release from Golgi membranes, allowing the
membrane at these sites to recruit cargo, alter their phospholipid
composition, and become larger, phase-separated domains.

Endocytosis of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and
the fluid phase takes place primarily through a dynamin (see DNM1;
602377)- and clathrin (see CLTC; 118955)-independent, CDC42
(116952)-regulated pinocytic mechanism. In Chinese hamster ovary cells,
Kumari and Mayor (2008) found that reduced activity or levels of Arf1
inhibited GPI-anchored protein and fluid-phase endocytosis without
affecting other clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytic pathways.
Arf1 was activated at distinct sites on the plasma membrane, and it
recruited the CDC42 GTPase-activating protein Arhgap10 (609746) to the
plasma membrane, thereby modulating cell surface Cdc42 dynamics. Kumari
and Mayor (2008) concluded that ARF1 regulates both endocytosis and
secretion and may provide a mechanism for crosstalk between these
processes.

Using a yeast genetic screen for substrates of the Shigella flexneri
type III effector protein IpaJ, Burnaevskiy et al. (2013) identified
Arf1 and Arf2 (ARF4; 601177). Mass spectrometric analysis showed that
IpaJ cleaved the peptide bond between myristoylated gly2 and asn3 of
human ARF1. Further analysis showed that IpaJ cleaved numerous
N-myristoylated proteins with various functions. Burnaevskiy et al.
(2013) concluded that IpaJ is a cysteine protease that cleaves the
N-myrisoylated glycine from ARF1, possibly as the substrate cycles
between activity-dependent conformational states. They proposed that
cleavage of lipidated proteins may be a mechanism of microbial
pathogenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Amor et al. (1994) described the 3-dimensional structure of full-length
human ARF1 in its GDP-bound nonmyristoylated form.

Mossessova et al. (1998) reported the crystal structure of the catalytic
Sec7 homology domain of ARNO (602488), a human guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) for ARF1, determined at 2.2-angstrom resolution.
The Sec7 domain is an elongated, all-helical protein with a distinctive
hydrophobic groove that is phylogenetically conserved. Structure-based
mutagenesis identifies the groove and an adjacent conserved loop as the
ARF-interacting surface. The sites of Sec7 domain interaction on ARF1
have subsequently been mapped, by protein footprinting experiments, to
the switch 1 and switch 2 GTPase regions, leading to a model for the
interaction between ARF GTPases and Sec7 domain exchange factors.

Nucleotide dissociation from small G protein-GEF complexes involves
transient GDP-bound intermediates. In the case of ARF proteins, small G
proteins that regulate membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells, such
intermediates can be trapped either by the natural inhibitor brefeldin A
or by charge reversal at the catalytic glutamate of the Sec7 domain of
their GEFs. Renault et al. (2003) reported the crystal structure of
these intermediates, which shows that membrane recruitment of ARF and
nucleotide dissociation are separate reactions stimulated by the Sec7
domain. The reactions proceed through sequential rotations of the
Arf-GDP core towards the Sec7 catalytic site, and are blocked by
interfacial binding of brefeldin A and unproductive stabilization of GDP
by charge reversal.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lee et al. (1992) determined that the ARF1 gene has 4 introns and spans
approximately 16.5 kb. Exon 1 (46 bp) contains only untranslated
sequence. The 5-prime flanking region has a high GC content but no TATA
or CAAT box, as found in housekeeping genes. The authors stated that the
2 human class I ARF genes, ARF1 and ARF3, have similar exon/intron
organizations and use GC-rich promoters.

MAPPING

Hirai et al. (1996) obtained an expressed sequence tag related to the
ARF1 gene and used fluorescence in situ hybridization to assign ARF1 to
1q42.

ATL-DERIVED PMA-RESPONSIVE GENE; APR;;
NOXA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify genes involved in leukemogenesis of adult T-cell leukemia
(ATL), Hijikata et al. (1990) constructed a cDNA library from an ATL
tumor cell line named IKD. By differential plaque hybridization using
P32-labeled cDNAs of poly(A+) RNA from IKD cells and a human
T-lymphotropic virus type I-infected T-cell line (C91/PL) as probes and
RNA blot analysis, Hijikata et al. (1990) obtained a cDNA clone of a
gene highly expressed in IKD cells. Expression of this gene was also
detected in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells of several ATL
patients, but not in those of healthy donors. The cDNA is 1,897 base
pairs in length, with a short open reading frame encoding a polypeptide
of 54 amino acids. Exposure of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
a T-cell lymphoma cell line (Jurkat), and quiescent human embryonic lung
cells to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) resulted in rapid,
transient expression of 2.0-kb mRNA of the gene. This induction was not
inhibited by cyclohexamide. Hijikata et al. (1990) named their gene APR
for 'ATL-derived PMA-responsive gene.' From these findings, Hijikata et
al. (1990) suggested APR as a member of the cellular
immediate-early-response genes.

The critical function of tumor suppressor p53 (191170) is the induction
of apoptosis in cells exposed to noxious stresses. Oda et al. (2000)
searched for target genes of IRF1 (147575), p53, or both that showed
increased transcription in response to DNA damage. They used an mRNA
differential display method to isolate cDNAs whose mRNA expression
profiles differed between the x-ray-irradiated wildtype and IRF1/p53
doubly deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). They identified a
gene that they called Noxa (for 'damage'). Oda et al. (2000) isolated
and characterized the mouse Noxa gene. The transcription initiation site
was determined to be 158 basepairs upstream from the initiator ATG, and
a potential p53 recognition sequence was located at -155 to -174 in the
promoter region. Its cDNA encodes a 103-amino acid protein with 2
mutually related 9-amino acid sequences characteristic to the BH3 motif
of the BCL2 family of proteins. Noxa mRNA was constitutively expressed
in small amounts in the brain, thymus, spleen, lung, kidney, and testis
of adult mice. Oda et al. (2000) screened for a human homolog of Noxa
cDNA and found that the cloned cDNA showing the highest degree of
similarity was identical to the APR gene. Human NOXA, or APR, encodes 54
amino acids, containing only 1 BH3 motif at amino acids 29 to 37. This
motif probably corresponds to the B motif of mouse Noxa, and the human
NOXA gene lacks the DNA segment corresponding to the second exon of
mouse Noxa. The promoter region of the human NOXA gene contains 1
p53-response element.

GENE FUNCTION

Oda et al. (2000) found that x-ray irradiation of wildtype MEFs
increased expression of Noxa mRNA about 5-fold, with kinetics similar to
those of the p53-dependent gene MDM2 (164785). In contrast, expression
of the Noxa gene was totally abolished in p53-deficient MEFs but not in
IRF1-deficient MEFs. When ectopically expressed, Noxa underwent BH3
motif-dependent localization to mitochondria and interacted with
antiapoptotic Bcl2 family members, resulting in the activation of
caspase-9 (602234). Human NOXA also induced apoptosis in various cells,
including Saos2 cells, in a BH3 motif-dependent manner. The introduction
of antisense oligonucleotide to NOXA inhibited p53-induced apoptosis.
Oda et al. (2000) concluded that Noxa may represent a novel mediator of
p53-dependent apoptosis.

Using a PCR-based subtractive hybridization approach, Kim et al. (2004)
found that Noxa was upregulated by hypoxia in cell lines from various
tissues in a p53-independent, Hif1a (603348)-dependent manner.
Upregulation of Noxa led to cell death by generating reactive oxygen
species (ROS) that induced cytochrome c release and caspase activation.
Induction of transient ischemia in a rat brain model, followed by TUNEL
analysis, revealed increased Noxa mRNA and protein expression and
apoptotic nuclei. The apoptosis could be reversed by liposomal delivery
of Noxa antisense oligonucleotides. Kim et al. (2004) concluded that
NOXA is an HIF1A-induced proapoptotic gene that mediates hypoxic cell
death by generation of ROS.

ANIMAL MODEL

Villunger et al. (2003) generated Noxa- and Puma- (605854) deficient
mice by targeted disruption. Null mice were born at the expected
frequency and became healthy adults. However, in both cases, there was
decreased DNA damage-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts, although only
loss of Puma protected lymphocytes from cell death. Puma deficiency also
protected cells against diverse p53-independent cytotoxic insults,
including cytokine deprivation and exposure to glucocorticoids, the
kinase inhibitor staurosporine, or phorbol ester. Villunger et al.
(2003) concluded that Puma and Noxa are critical mediators of the
apoptotic responses induced by p53 and other agents.

608879	TITLE *608879 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 13, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, C; VPS13C
;;KIAA1421
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned VPS13C, which they designated
KIAA1421. The deduced protein contains 1,463 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected VPS13C expression in all adult and fetal tissues and all
specific brain regions examined. Expression was intermediate in most
tissues, but it was lower in adult pancreas and lung and in fetal liver
and brain.

By searching databases for sequences similar to VPS13A (605978),
followed by RT-PCR of lymphoid cell line and brain RNA, Velayos-Baeza et
al. (2004) cloned VPS13C. They identified 2 main splice variants,
variant 1A and variant 2A, as well as 4 different 3-prime end splice
variants. Variant 1A encodes a deduced 3,710-amino acid protein, and
variant 2A encodes a deduced 3,753-amino acid protein. VPS13C shares
significant similarity with yeast Vps13 and other human VPS13 proteins,
mostly in the N and C termini. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of variant 1A in all tissues tested, whereas variant 2A was
expressed only in brain, although at a higher level than variant 1A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) determined that the VPS13C gene contains 86
exons, including 1 alternative exon (exon 81b), and spans 208 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the VPS13C
gene to chromosome 15. By genomic sequence analysis, Velayos-Baeza et
al. (2004) mapped the VPS13C gene to chromosome 15q21.3. They mapped the
mouse Vps13c gene to chromosome 9C.

608100	TITLE *608100 NFU1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; NFU1
;;IRON-SULFUR CLUSTER SCAFFOLD PROTEIN NFU1;;
HIRA-INTERACTING PROTEIN 5; HIRIP5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NFU1 gene encodes a protein that plays an essential role in the
production of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters for the normal maturation of
lipoate-containing 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and for the assembly of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (summary by Cameron et al.,
2011).

CLONING

Using a C-terminal fragment of HIRA (600237) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed by screening a U937
monocyte cDNA library, Lorain et al. (2001) cloned HIRIP5. The HIRIP5
cDNA contains 3 putative start methionines, resulting in deduced
proteins of 230, 196, and 169 amino acids. By searching sequence
databases, Lorain et al. (2001) identified homologs of HIRIP5 in several
species, including mouse. The 3 start codons in the human sequence are
conserved in mouse, but the first is out of frame. Translation from the
first conserved in-frame start codon in mouse yields a 199-amino acid
protein that is 97% identical to the 196-amino acid human protein.
Alignment of HIRIP5 homologs revealed a protein structure consisting of
an N-terminal domain with 5 conserved residues; a central domain with 8
conserved residues; a linker region; a C-terminal domain; and a variable
C terminus. HIRIP5 may have a mitochondrial localization signal.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.1-kb transcript in nearly all adult
and fetal tissues examined.

Tong et al. (2003) identified several clones corresponding to human NFU1
that differed from HIRIP5 in the human expressed sequence tag database.
The identified sequences extended the 5-prime sequence to include an
upstream in-frame ATG, indicating at least 2 mRNA isoforms. Exon 1
contains 2 potential 5-prime donor splice sites that are used to
generate isoform I containing exon 1A but not exon 1B, or isoform II
(HIRIP5) containing both exon 1A and exon 1B. However, exon 1B contains
a stop codon, so isoform II is initiated at a downstream codon. Isoform
I was shown to localize to mitochondria in COS-7 cells. Functional
isoform II lacks the first 24 amino acids found in isoform I and
localizes to the cytosol.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro pull-down assays of recombinant proteins, Lorain et al.
(2001) confirmed that HIRIP5 interacts with HIRA.

Using the yeast 2-hybrid system, Ganesh et al. (2003) determined that
the C-terminal NifU-like domain of HIRIP5 interacts specifically with
the N-terminal CBD4 domain of laforin, encoded by the EPM2A gene
(607566). They also determined that HIRIP5 is a substrate for the
phosphatase activity of laforin.

Using biochemical and spectroscopic techniques, Tong et al. (2003)
demonstrated that NFU1 is an iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein that
assembles 1 labile 4Fe-4S cluster per 2 NFU1 monomers.

MAPPING

By radioactive in situ hybridization, Lorain et al. (2001) mapped the
HIRIP5 gene to chromosome 2p15-p13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 Mexican sibs with fatal multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions
syndrome-1 (MMDS1; 605711) originally reported by Seyda et al. (2001),
Cameron et al. (2011) identified a homozygous splice site mutation in
the NFU1 gene (608100.0001) resulting in no detectable mature protein in
patient fibroblasts. Transduction of fibroblast lines with retroviral
vectors expressing the mitochondrial, but not the cytosolic, isoform of
NFU1 corrected the defects in respiratory chain and oxoacid
dehydrogenase complex function. The results indicated that NFU1 plays an
essential role in the production of iron-sulfur clusters for the normal
maturation of lipoate-containing 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and for the
assembly of the respiratory chain complexes.

In 9 patients from unrelated Spanish families with fatal multiple
mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome-1, Navarro-Sastre et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous mutation in the NFU1 gene (G208C; 608100.0002).
Studies in yeast cells showed that it impaired NFU1 function.

MULTIPLE MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTIONS SYNDROME 1
NFU1, 545G-A

In 3 Mexican sibs with fatal multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions
syndrome-1 (MMDS1; 605711) originally reported by Seyda et al. (2001),
Cameron et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 545G-A transition in exon
6 of the NFU1 gene. Although 545G-A is predicted to result in an
arg182-to-gln (R182Q) substitution, it is also adjacent to a splice
site, and RT-PCR analysis showed that exon 6 is spliced out from the
majority of transcripts. There was no detectable mitochondrial NFU1
protein in fibroblasts of 1 of the patients. Biochemical studies of
patient fibroblasts showed a decrease in iron-sulfur cluster-containing
respiratory chain complexes and a lack of detectable lipoate in the
pyruvate dehydrogenase and oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes.
Mitochondrial, but not the cytosolic version, of NFU1 rescued the
respiratory chain and oxoacid dehydrogenase defects in immortalized
fibroblasts.

In a Spanish infant with fatal MMDS1, Navarro-Sastre et al. (2011)
identified compound heterozygosity for the 545G-A mutation and a
gly208-to-cys (G208C; 608100.0002) substitution in NFU1. Examination of
patient cells showed no mRNA expression of the 545G-A mutation,
consistent with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Expression of the mutation
in COS-7 cells showed that it caused defective splicing and the skipping
of exon 6.

.0002
MULTIPLE MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTIONS SYNDROME 1
NFU1, GLY208CYS

In 9 patients from unrelated Spanish families with fatal multiple
mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome-1 (605711), Navarro-Sastre et al.
(2011) identified a homozygous 622G-T transversion in exon 7 of the NFU1
gene, resulting in a gly208-to-cys (G208C) substitution in a highly
conserved residue close to the Fe-S cluster binding motif. The mutation
was not found in 220 controls. A tenth Spanish patient was compound
heterozygous for G208C and 545G-A (608100.0001). Four of the families
were of Basque origin, suggesting a founder effect. The patients
presented between 1 and 9 months of age with failure to thrive,
neurologic regression, or pulmonary hypertension. All died by age 15
months. Biochemical findings included increased lactate and glycine,
increased urinary 2-ketoacids, and impaired oxidation. Patient
fibroblasts showed decreased activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
(PDH) complex and liver tissue showed low activity of the glycine
decarboxylase system (238300). Muscle homogenates from patients showed
evidence of defective lipoylation and impaired synthesis of lipoic acid,
with decreased levels of PDH- and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
(AKGDH; 613022)-bound lipoic acid. NFU1 protein levels were normal. The
findings indicated that proper NFU1 activity is required for lipoic acid
synthetase (LIAS; 607031) activity. Depletion of NFU1 in HeLa cells
showed decreased levels of lipoic acid bound to E2 subunits of the PDH
complex and AKGDH, and decreased levels and activity of succinate
dehydrogenase (SDH; mitochondrial complex II; 185470). In contrast to
ISCU (611911), which plays a scaffolding role, NFU1 appears to play a
specific, auxiliary role late in the biogenesis of SDH and LIAS, 2 Fe-S
apoproteins. Transfection of the homologous G208C mutation in yeast
showed that it was functionally impaired.

;;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-LIKE 1; TCFL1;;
TRANSFORMATION SUPPRESSOR GENE YL-1; YL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Horikawa et al. (1995) followed up on previous observations that various
transformed phenotypes of Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed NIH 3T3
cells were suppressed by introduction of a normal human chromosome 1 via
microcell fusion and that revertant cells that re-acquired the
transformed phenotype commonly lost the human 1q21 and 1q23-q24 regions.
The observations had suggested the location of a transformation
suppressor gene(s) on the proximal portion of 1q. Horikawa et al. (1995)
isolated a novel human cDNA on 1q21, designated YL1, as a candidate, and
then cloned its mouse homolog. Human and mouse YL1 cDNA shared 96% amino
acid homology and presumably encoded a transcription factor-like
polypeptide. An analysis using a specific antibody demonstrated nuclear
localization of YL1 protein. The bacterially expressed YL1 could bind to
DNA. Thus, the YL1 protein possibly functions as a transcriptional
regulator.

Cai et al. (2005) stated that the YL1 protein contains 364 amino acids
and that it is highly conserved from humans to yeast.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cox et al. (2001) determined that the YL1 gene contains 6 coding exons
spanning 14.2 kb and intergenically splices into TMOD4 (605834). The
last exon of YL1 is 291 bp from a 5-prime untranslated exon of TMOD4.
Cox et al. (2001) also found that YL1 undergoes unconventional splicing
using noncanonical splice sites within exons to produce several
alternative transcripts.

MAPPING

Horikawa et al. (1995) identified the YL1 gene on chromosome 1q21.

GENE FUNCTION

Cai et al. (2005) demonstrated that epitope-tagged YL1 associated with
proteins of the TRRAP (603015)/TIP60 (HTATIP; 601409) histone
acetyltransferase complex in transfected HeLa cells. In addition, YL1
was part of a subset of proteins that also functioned as subunits of the
SWI2/SNF2 (SMARCA2; 600014)-related CBP (CREBBP; 600140) activator
protein (SRCAP) chromatin remodeling complex.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DPEP1 (EC 3.4.13.11) is a kidney membrane enzyme that hydrolyzes a
variety of dipeptides and is implicated in renal metabolism of
glutathione and its conjugates, e.g., leukotriene D4 (Kozak and Tate,
1982). DPEP1 is responsible for hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring of
antibiotics, such as penem and carbapenem (Campbell et al., 1984).
Earlier, beta-lactamase enzymes were thought to occur only in bacteria,
where their probable function was in protecting the organisms against
the action of beta-lactam antibiotics. These antibiotics exhibit
selective toxicity against bacteria but virtual inertness against many
eukaryotic cells (Adachi et al., 1990).

CLONING

Adachi et al. (1990) isolated and characterized cDNA clones for human
DPEP1, which they called RDP. DNA and RNA blot analysis indicated the
existence of a single gene.

To isolate potential tumor/growth suppressor genes involved in Wilms
tumor, Austruy et al. (1993) constructed a cDNA library by cloning a
mature kidney cDNA subtracted with an excess of Wilms tumor mRNA. Clones
were selected according to a differential pattern of expression, i.e.,
positive with RNA from mature kidney and negative with RNA from several
Wilms tumors. By comparison of sequences of these clones with database
sequences, 1 clone was identified as DPEP1.

Nitanai et al. (2002) stated that RDP is a homodimer of identical
369-amino acid subunits. Each subunit has a calculated molecular mass of
about 42 kD, but N-glycosylation at 4 possible sites results in a highly
glycosylated peptide of about 63 kD. In addition, each RDP subunit has a
C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor.

Habib et al. (2003) cloned mouse Dpep1, which they designated Mbd1.
Northern blot analysis detected 3 transcripts that were differentially
expressed in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, and testis. No
Mbd1 expression was detected in brain and spleen. The transcripts likely
arise from the use of alternate poly(A) sites and variations in the
5-prime UTR.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nitanai et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure of human RDP.
Each subunit appears to assume a barrel shape made up of 8 alpha helix
and beta sheet pairs. Each monomer requires 2 zinc ions that are ligated
to the catalytic residues (glu125, his198, and his219) at the bottom of
the enzymatic pocket. His152 is not ligated to zinc, but it is
responsible for recognition of a substrate or inhibitor. The pocket is
reinforced by 2 adjacent disulfide bonds and by 3 proline residues.
Cys361 is involved in a disulfide bridge between monomers.

GENE FUNCTION

Kera et al. (1999) measured dipeptidase activity in several human
postmortem tissues and in rat tissues using glycyl-D-alanine as
substrate. Highest activity in human tissues was detected in kidney
cortex, pancreas, and testis. Much lower activity was detected in
adrenal gland and liver, and very low activity was detected in lung,
spleen, cerebrum, and cerebellum. The enzyme was also found in serum and
urine from healthy volunteers. Activity in rats was similar, but was
much higher in lung. The distribution of enzyme activity in various
tissues changed in postnatal rats up to 8 weeks of age.

Habib et al. (2003) demonstrated that COS-7 cells transfected with mouse
Mbd1 were able to convert leukotriene D4 to leukotriene E4 and could
hydrolyze cystinyl-bis-glycine (cys-bis-gly) and beta-lactam. Inhibition
of Mbd1 by penicillamine indicated that it is a metallopeptidase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Satoh et al. (1993) determined that the DPEP1 gene contains 10 exons and
spans about 6 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nakagawa et al. (1991) mapped the RDP gene to chromosome 16q24.

Austruy et al. (1993) used somatic cell hybrids carrying either
different human chromosomes or chromosome 16 segments to confirm and
refine the physical mapping of DPEP1 to 16q24.3. Two RFLPs were
described and used to show linkage of DPEP1 to D16S7; maximum lod score
was 5.8 at theta of 0.03.

ANIMAL MODEL

Habib et al. (1998) found that Mbd1-deficient mice retained partial
ability to degrade cys-bis-gly and to convert leukotriene D4 to
leukotriene E4 depending on the tissue examined. Habib et al. (2003)
suggested that tissue- and substrate-specific activities of Mbd2 (DPEP2;
609925) and Mbd3 (DPEP3; 609926) partially compensate for the loss of
Mbd1 in these mice.

604267	TITLE *604267 MULTIPLE EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE DOMAINS 8; MEGF8
;;EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR-LIKE 4, FORMERLY; EGFL4, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The domain that characterizes epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)
consists of approximately 50 amino acids with 3 disulfide bonds.
EGF-like domains are believed to play a critical role in a number of
extracellular events, including cell adhesion and receptor-ligand
interactions. Proteins with EGF-like domains often consist of more than
1,000 amino acids, have multiple copies of the EGF-like domain, and
contain additional domains known to be involved in specific
protein-protein interactions. To identify proteins containing EGF-like
domains, Nakayama et al. (1998) searched a database of long cDNA
sequences randomly selected from a human brain cDNA library for those
that encode an EGF-like motif. They identified several partial cDNAs
encoding novel proteins with EGF-like domains, such as EGFL4, which they
named MEGF8. The predicted partial EGFL4 protein has a laminin (e.g.,
150240)-type EGF-like domain, 5 EGF-like domains, and a transmembrane
domain.

MAPPING

Using a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nakayama et al. (1998) mapped
the EGFL4 gene to 19q12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 unrelated probands with a form of Carpenter syndrome frequently
associated with defective lateralization (CRPT2; 614976), Twigg et al.
(2012) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the
MEGF8 gene (see, e.g., 604267.0001-604267.0004).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis in mice, Zhang et al.
(2009) found a recessive phenotype characterized by heterotaxy, complex
congenital heart defects, and preaxial polydactyly that was associated
with a cys193-to-arg (C193R) substitution in the Megf8 gene on mouse
chromosome 7. The authors used massively parallel sequencing to identify
the mutation. The substitution eliminated an invariant cysteine situated
in the second putative EGF domain and could disrupt formation of a
disulfide bond required for proper protein folding. Megf8 transcripts
were ubiquitously expressed in both wildtype and mutant mouse embryos.
Immunostaining showed punctate nuclear localization with Gfi1b (604383)
and Baf60c (SMARCD3; 601737), 2 proteins involved in chromatin
remodeling. Mutant mice showed normal breaking of symmetry at the node,
but Nodal (601265) signaling failed to be propagated to the left lateral
plate mesoderm. Cilia motility was unaffected. Morpholino knockdown of
Megf8 in zebrafish embryos resulted in a heterotaxic phenotype with
discordant heart and gut situs. The findings suggested that MEGF8 is an
essential regulator of left-right patterning.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARPENTER SYNDROME 2
MEGF8, ARG1499HIS

In a 9-year-old Turkish boy with features of Carpenter syndrome and
dextrocardia (CRPT2; 614976), Twigg et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for a 4496G-A transition in exon 26 of the MEGF8 gene,
resulting in an arg1499-to-his (R1499H) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in a kelch domain. The mutation was present in
heterozygosity in his unaffected parents and sister, but was not found
in the dbSNP135 or Exome Variant Server databases. In zebrafish
morpholino knockdown experiments, coinjection of the R1499H mutant did
not result in effective rescue compared to wildtype, but the reduced
proportion of epiboly defects (down to 60% from 83%) suggested that the
mutant protein might retain some residual function.

.0002
CARPENTER SYNDROME 2
MEGF8, SER2367GLY

In a 6.5-year-old German girl with features of Carpenter syndrome
(CRPT2; 614976), Twigg et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity
for a missense and a nonsense mutation in the MEGF8 gene: a 7099A-G
transition in exon 41, resulting in a ser2367-to-gly (S2367G)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in an EGF-like laminin
domain, and a 1342C-T transition in exon 7, resulting in an
arg448-to-ter (R448X; 604267.0002) substitution. The patient's
unaffected father was heterozygous for the S367G mutation, which was not
found in 192 northern European controls, and her unaffected mother was
heterozygous for the R448X mutation, which was not found in 189 Turkish
controls; neither mutation was found in the dbSNP135 or Exome Variant
Server databases. In zebrafish morpholino knockdown experiments,
coinjection of the S236G mutant did not result in effective rescue
compared to wildtype, but the reduced proportion of epiboly defects
(down to 71% from 83%) suggested that the mutant protein might retain
some residual function.

In a Turkish boy with features of Carpenter syndrome who also exhibited
dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis (CRPT2; 604267), originally
reported by Altunhan et al. (2011), Twigg et al. (2012) identified
homozygosity for a 595G-C transversion in exon 4 of the MEGF8 gene,
resulting in a gly199-to-arg (G199R) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in an EGF domain. The proband's unaffected father and 2
unaffected sisters were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in 189 Turkish controls or in the dbSNP135 or Exome Variant Server
databases; his mother was deceased. In zebrafish morpholino knockdown
experiments, coinjection of the G199R mutant did not result in effective
rescue compared to wildtype, but the reduced proportion of epiboly
defects (down to 73% from 83%) suggested that the mutant protein might
retain some residual function.

611856	TITLE *611856 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L52; MRPL52
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL52
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl52 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL52. They also identified MRPL52 homologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast, E. coli, or Arabidopsis.
Mouse and human MRPL52 share 85.1% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MRPL52
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP RH103319).

603189	TITLE *603189 SYNTAXIN 5; STX5
;;STX5A
DESCRIPTION In eukaryotic cells, vesicle docking is thought to be regulated in part
by the specific interactions of a vesicle-associated membrane protein
(VAMP), or synaptobrevin (e.g., 185880), with the presynaptic plasma
membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP25 (600322). By PCR using
oligonucleotides based on the sequence of rat syntaxin-5, Ravichandran
and Roche (1997) isolated a partial cDNA encoding human syntaxin-5. They
used the partial cDNA to clone a full-length human syntaxin-5 cDNA from
an EBV-transformed lymphocyte cell cDNA library. The predicted 301-amino
acid human protein is 96% identical to rat syntaxin-5. In vitro, human
syntaxin-5 bound efficiently to rat VAMP2 (see SYB2; 185881) but not to
human SNAP25.

To fuse transport vesicles with target membranes, proteins of the SNARE
complex must be located on both the vesicle and the target membrane. In
yeast, 4 integral membrane proteins, Sed5, Bos1, Sec22 (see 604029), and
Bet1 (605456) each are believed to contribute a single helix to form the
SNARE complex that is needed for transport from endoplasmic reticulum to
Golgi. This generates a 4-helix bundle, which ultimately mediates the
actual fusion event. Parlati et al. (2000) explored how the anchoring
arrangement of the 4 helices affects their ability to mediate fusion.
Parlati et al. (2000) reconstituted 2 populations of phospholipid
bilayer vesicles, with the individual SNARE proteins distributed in all
possible combinations between them. Of the 8 nonredundant permutations
of 4 subunits distributed over 2 vesicle populations, only 1 resulted in
membrane fusion. Fusion occurred only when the v-SNARE Bet1 is on 1
membrane and the syntaxin heavy chain Sed5 and its 2 light chains, Bos1
and Sec22, are on the other membrane, where they form a functional
t-SNARE. Thus, each SNARE protein is topologically restricted by design
to function either as a v-SNARE or as part of a t-SNARE complex.

Windpassinger et al. (2003) observed that Human Genome Project sequence
data indicated that the STX5A gene is located on 11q12-q14, the region
to which the locus for Silver spastic paraplegia syndrome (270685) had
been mapped. They excluded STX5A as the mutant gene, as no mutations
were found on sequence analysis of at least 2 affected individuals from
each of 4 different families and 1 healthy control.

;;DYNEIN, LIGHT CHAIN 2B; DNLC2B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for sequences homologous to rat robl/LC7-like
gene-1, Jiang et al. (2001) identified 2 members of the dynein family
that they designated DNLC2A (607167) and DNLC2B. Both DNLC2A and DNLC2B
encode deduced 96-amino acid proteins with molecular masses of 10.9 and
10.8 kD, respectively. The proteins share 77% sequence identity and show
high homology to robl/LC7 dynein proteins. Northern blot analysis
detected higher expression of DNLC2B than of DNLC2A in all normal
tissues tested except liver. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues of 68 Chinese patients showed
upregulation of DNLC2A in 45 cases and dowregulation of DNLC2B in 44
cases compared with adjacent tumor-free liver tissues. In 7 additional
cancer cell lines studied, DNLC2A was highly expressed in all, whereas
DNLC2B was highly expressed in only 1 HCC cell line.

By genomic sequence analysis, Pazour et al. (2006) mapped the DYNLRB2
gene to chromosome 16q23.3.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ron and Habener (1992) cloned mouse Ddit3, which they called Chop.
Antisera raised against Chop recognized a nuclear protein with a
molecular mass of 29 kD.

Park et al. (1992) isolated the DDIT3 gene, which they called GADD153,
from human cells. The DDIT3 gene shows a high level of conservation in
both the structural and regulatory regions to the previously described
hamster gene. The human and hamster proteins share 91% amino acid
identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Ron and Habener (1992) showed that CHOP serves as a dominant-negative
inhibitor of the transcription factors C/EBP (116897, 116898) and LAP
(189965). They found that bacterially expressed CHOP inhibited the
DNA-binding activity of C/EBP and LAP by forming heterodimers that could
not bind DNA.

Using differential expression and immunohistochemical analyses of benign
nevi and melanomas of different levels, Korabiowska et al. (1997)
observed p53 (TP53; 191170) negativity and high expression of GADD34
(PPP1R15A; 611048), GADD45 (GADD45A; 126335), and GADD153 in all nevi.
However, in melanomas, p53 expression increased and GADD expression
decreased with the Clark level of melanoma thickness. Patient survival
time correlated negatively with p53 positivity and positively with
GADD45 and GADD153 expression. Korabiowska et al. (1997) concluded that
GADD proteins play an important role in the malignant transformation of
nevus to melanoma.

CHOP is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress imposed by
unfolded and malfolded proteins. By transcriptional profiling, Marciniak
et al. (2004) compared gene expression in unstressed and ER-stressed
wildtype and Chop -/- primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. They found that
Chop directly activated Gadd34, which promoted ER protein biosynthesis
by dephosphorylating Eif2-alpha (EIF2S1; 603907) in stressed cells,
causing accumulation of high molecular mass protein complexes in the
stressed ER. Chop also activated Ero1-alpha (ERO1L; 615435), which
encodes an ER oxidase. Consequently, the ER of stressed Chop -/- cells
was hypooxidized relative to the ER of stressed wildtype cells.
Pharmacologic and genetic manipulations promoting a hypooxidized ER
reduced abnormal high molecular mass protein complexes and protected
cells from the lethal consequences of ER stress. Marciniak et al. (2004)
concluded that Chop deletion protected cells from ER stress by
decreasing ER protein load and changing redox conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Park et al. (1992) determined that the human and hamster DDIT3 genes
both contain 4 exons, with the intron/exon junctions maintained at
identical positions.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization, Park et al.
(1992) mapped the DDIT3 gene to chromosome 12q13.1-q13.2.

CYTOGENETICS

CHOP is consistently rearranged in myxoid liposarcomas (613488) (Aman et
al., 1992). In the characteristic chromosomal translocation
t(12;16)(q13;p11), Crozat et al. (1993) showed that the CHOP gene is
fused with a gene on chromosome 16 provisionally designated TLS
(translocated in liposarcoma). The same gene was called FUS by Rabbitts
et al. (1993); see 137070. The TLS gene was found to be a novel nuclear
RNA-binding protein with extensive sequence similarity to EWS (133450),
the product of a gene commonly translocated in Ewing sarcoma (612219).
In TLS-CHOP, the RNA-binding domain of TLS is replaced by the
DNA-binding and leucine zipper dimerization domain of CHOP. Targeting of
a conserved effector domain of RNA-binding proteins to DNA may play a
role in tumor formation.

In an analysis of peripheral blood samples from 19 patients with myxoid
liposarcoma due to t(12;16) and in 1 patient with myxoid liposarcoma due
to t(12;22;20), resulting in the fusion of the CHOP and EWS genes,
Panagopoulos et al. (1996) found FUS/CHOP hybrid fragments in 3 patients
with t(12;16) and a EWS/CHOP hybrid in the patient with the latter
translocation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Endo et al. (2006) found that mice challenged intratracheally with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed Chop and Bip (HSPA5; 138120).
Compared with wildtype mice, mice lacking Chop showed reduced lung
inflammation in response to LPS, diminished Il1b (147720) activity, and
suppression of Casp11 (SFRS2IP; 603668) induction in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid. Inflammation of lung in response to Il1b was not
attenuated in Chop-deficient mice. Endo et al. (2006) concluded that
CHOP is critical in LPS-induced lung injury and in induction of CASP11,
which mediates activation of pro-CASP1 (147678) and pro-IL1B.

609367	TITLE *609367 KIAA1279 GENE; KIAA1279
;;KINESIN-BINDING PROTEIN; KBP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned KIAA1279. The deduced protein
contains 632 amino acids. RT-PCR detected high expression in heart,
brain, ovary, testis, spinal cord, and all specific brain regions
examined. Moderate expression was detected in all other adult tissues
examined, as well as in fetal liver and brain.

Brooks et al. (2005) reported that the KIAA1279 gene encodes a 621-amino
acid protein that shares 89% sequence homology with the mouse homolog.
The predicted protein contains 2 tetratricopeptide repeats. Northern
blot analysis of adult and fetal tissues detected expression of a 2.4-kb
transcript in all tissues except blood leukocytes. The transcript was
present in different parts of the adult central nervous system,
including cerebellum, cortex, medulla, spinal cord, occipital lobe,
frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and putamen.

By in situ hybridization of zebrafish embryos, Alves et al. (2010) found
that Kbp was ubiquitously and diffusely expressed in early development
and later became enriched in the central and enteric nervous systems.
Fluorescence-tagged Kbp was expressed in the cytoplasm of transfected
N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells, with enrichment at the Golgi
apparatus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Brooks et al. (2005) stated that the KIAA1279 gene contains 7 exons
spanning 28 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the KIAA1279
gene to chromosome 10.

Gross (2012) mapped the KIAA1279 gene to chromosome 10q22.1 based on an
alignment of the KIAA1279 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC012180) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of an embryonic mouse cDNA library, Alves et
al. (2010) found that Kbp interacted with the microtubule-destabilizing
protein Scg10 (STMN2; 600621), with tubulin alpha-7 (Tuba3b), and with
the kinesins Kif5b (602809), Kif5c (604593), Kif7 (611254), Kif2c
(604538), Kif3a (604683), and Kifc1 (603763). Sequencing revealed that
Kbp interacted with kinesin motor domains. Coimmunoprecipitation
analysis of transfected HEK293 cells and colocalization of Kbp and Scg10
in N1E-115 cells confirmed the interaction between Kbp and Scg10. Kbp
did not appear to interact directly with microtubules. Knockdown of Kbp
expression in rat PC12 cells inhibited NGF-beta (NGFB; 162030)-induced
neurite outgrowth. Alves et al. (2010) concluded that KBP has an
indirect role in regulating microtubule dynamics and neurite outgrowth
via its interaction with SCG10.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using homozygosity mapping in a large consanguineous Moroccan family
with Goldberg-Shprintzen megacolon syndrome (GOSHS; 609460), which is
characterized by microcephaly, mental retardation, facial dysmorphism,
and Hirschsprung disease, Brooks et al. (2005) mapped the disorder to
chromosome 10q21.3-q22.1. In affected members of this family, they
identified homozygosity for an arg90-to-ter mutation (609367.0001) in
the KIAA1279 gene. All patients in this family had bilateral generalized
polymicrogyria in addition to Hirschsprung disease, thus establishing
the importance of KIAA1279 in both enteric and central nervous system
development. In 4 affected members of a consanguineous British Pakistani
family, Brooks et al. (2005) identified homozygosity for a glu84-to-ter
mutation (609367.0002) in the KIAA1279 gene.

gene, resulting in an arg90-to-ter (R90X) substitution and a shortened

resulting in a glu84-to-ter (E84X) substitution.
