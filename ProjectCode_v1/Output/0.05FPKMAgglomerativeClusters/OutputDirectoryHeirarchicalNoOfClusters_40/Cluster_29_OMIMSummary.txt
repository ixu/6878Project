;;HVG1;;
VAULT RNA COMPONENT 1; VAULTRC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vaults are large cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins of about 13 MD. They are
composed of a major vault protein, MVP (605088), 2 minor vault proteins,
TEP1 (601686) and PARP4 (607519), and a nontranslated RNA component,
VTRNA1-1 (Kickhoefer et al., 1999).

CLONING

By PCR of a human genomic DNA library, Kickhoefer et al. (1998) cloned
VTRNA1-1, which they called HVG1. The 96-base RNA contains an internal
RNA polymerase III (see 606007)-type promoter element and ends with a
typical polymerase III termination signal.

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) found that the mouse genome contains only 1
expressed vault RNA gene, which they called Mvr1. Northern blot analysis
detected a single Mvr1 transcript in all mouse tissues examined, with
highest expression in lung, heart, and spleen and lowest expression in
brain.

Nandy et al. (2009) described the structure of VTRNA1-1. The
99-nucleotide RNA forms an extended stem-loop structure with asymmetric
internal bulges. It contains characteristic internal polymerase III
A-box and B-box promoter elements and a downstream B2-box motif. Size
exclusion chromatography of fractionated HeLa cells, followed by
Northern and Western blot analyses, detected about 5% of the VTRNA1-1
and VTRNA1-2 content eluting with MVP, while 95% remained in the
supernatant.

GENE FUNCTION

Kickhoefer et al. (1998) found that HVG1, but not HVG2 (VTRNA1-2;
612696) or HVG3 (VTRNA1-3; 612696), associated with vaults in human cell
lines. However, only a proportion of HVG1 associated with vaults, and
HVG1 not associated with vaults remained in the soluble fraction.
Expression of MVP and HVG1 and assembly of vaults increased up to
15-fold in several drug-resistant cell lines compared with the parental
cell lines. Increased vault assembly was associated with a concomitant
shift of HVG1 from the soluble to the pellet fraction. Kickhoefer et al.
(1998) hypothesized that the absolute vault level in cell lines may
dictate the extent of drug resistance.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kickhoefer et al. (1999) found that the
vault RNAs HVG1 and HVG4 copurified with vaults from all human cell
types examined and interacted with mouse Tep1 in a yeast 3-hybrid
screen. However, Kickhoefer et al. (2003) reported that HVG4 is not
expressed.

Nandy et al. (2009) found that expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2,
VTRNA1-3, and CBL3 (VTRNA2-1; 614938) was upregulated in cord blood
lymphocytes infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Upregulation was
highest for VTRNA1-1 (about 1,100-fold) and lowest for CBL3 (about
3-fold). Expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and CBL3 was also upregulated
by the EBV-related Kaposi sarcoma virus, but not by members of other
virus families.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) determined that the upstream region of the
VTRNA1-1 gene contains a TATA-like element, a consensus proximal
sequence, and a cAMP response element.

MAPPING

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) stated that the VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and
VTRNA1-3 genes map to a 16-kb region of chromosome 5. A vault RNA
pseudogene, HVG4, maps to chromosome X. The only expressed mouse vault
RNA gene, Mvr1, maps to chromosome 18.

Nandy et al. (2009) stated that the VTRNA1-1 gene is located near the
PCDHA gene cluster (604966), which Wu and Maniatis (1999) mapped to
chromosome 5q31.

611966	TITLE *611966 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 9; TRAPPC9
;;NIK- AND IKBKB-BINDING PROTEIN; NIBP;;
KIAA1882
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NIBP binds NIK (604655) and IKK-beta (IKBKB; 603258) and plays a role in
the neuronal NF-kappa-B (see 164011) signaling pathway (Hu et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from an adult amygdala cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (2001) cloned a partial cDNA encoding NIBP, which they
designated KIAA1882. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in all
tissues and specific brain regions examined.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library using
N-terminal NIK (MAP3K14; 604655) as bait, followed by database analysis,
Hu et al. (2005) cloned NIBP. The deduced 1,246-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 139.4 kD and shares 80 to 90% homology with
the corresponding rodent sequences. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 4.5-kb transcript with high expression in muscle and
kidney, and lower levels in brain, heart, and placenta; 2 smaller
transcripts of 2.1 and 1.5 kb were also detected. Immunohistochemical
studies detected NIBP protein in neuronal cells in mouse brain with
staining localized to cell bodies and neuronal processes in the
pyramidal layer of mouse cortex, spinal cord motor neurons, and white
matter neurons.

Mochida et al. (2009) noted that there are 2 transcript variants of
TRAPPC9 in humans. Variant 1 is the longer form and encodes a
1,246-amino acid protein. Variant 2 uses an alternate 5-prime exon
initiating translation at a downstream start codon and encodes a
1,148-amino acid protein. In situ hybridization showed low levels of
expression in mouse embryonic brain with strong expression in adult
brain. Trappc9 was found in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus,
and deep gray matter. Trappc9 immunoreactivity was widespread in the
cytoplasm, without specific localization to any particular organelle,
and was not found in the nucleus. In 11.5-week human embryonic brain,
there was higher expression in the developing cortical plate compared to
the ventricular zone, indicating higher expression in postmitotic
neurons than in progenitor cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hu et al. (2005) determined that the TRAPPC9 gene contains 23 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hu et al. (2005) mapped the TRAPPC9 gene
to chromosome 8q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, Hu et al. (2005)
showed that NIBP interacted with NIK and IKK-beta but showed no
interaction with IKK-alpha (CHUK; 600664) or IKK-gamma (IKBKG; 300248).
NIBP overexpression in HEK293T cells potentiated TNFA (191160)-induced
NF-kappa-B activation through increased phosphorylation of the IKK
complex and its downstream substrates IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008) and p65
(NFKB3; 164014). Mobility shift assays demonstrated increased NF-kappa-B
DNA binding. Knockdown of NIBP by siRNA reduced TNFA-induced NF-kappa-B
activation, prevented NGF (see 162030)-induced neuronal differentiation,
and decreased BCLXL (see BCL2L1; 600039) gene expression in PC12 cells.
Hu et al. (2005) suggested that NIBP may act as an adaptor to recruit
NIK or other kinases to the IKK complex, and that NIBP acts as a
downstream component of NGF in neuronal cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis, followed by candidate gene sequencing,
of an Israeli Arab family with nonsyndromic mental retardation (MRT13;
613192), Mochida et al. (2009) identified a homozygous truncating
mutation in the TRAPPC9 gene (R475X; 611966.0001).

Mir et al. (2009) identified the R475X mutation in affected members of a
Pakistani family with MRT13 and identified a 4-bp deletion (611966.0003)
in affected members of an Iranian family with MRT13, previously reported
by Najmabadi et al. (2007).

Philippe et al. (2009) identified a nonsense mutation in the TRAPPC9
gene (611966.0002) in 3 Tunisian brothers with autosomal recessive
mental retardation.

In 2 sisters, born of unrelated parents from southern Italy, with MRT13,
Marangi et al. (2013) identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the
TRAPPC9 gene (611966.0004).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 13
TRAPPC9, ARG475TER

In affected members of an Israeli Arab family with nonsyndromic
autosomal recessive mental retardation and postnatal microcephaly
(MRT13; 613192), Mochida et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1423C-T
transition in exon 7 of the TRAPPC9 gene, resulting in an arg475-to-ter
(R475X) substitution in TRAPPC9 variant 1. The same change represents
1129C-T, resulting in an arg377-to-ter (R377X) substitution, in TRAPPC9
variant 2. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation, and
it was not identified in 306 control chromosomes. The protein was not
detected in patient lymphoblast cell lines.

Mir et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1422C-T transition in the
TRAPPC9 gene, resulting in an R475X mutation, in affected members of a
large consanguineous Pakistani family with mental retardation. The
mutant protein was not expressed, consistent with nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. Affected individuals had borderline microcephaly, delayed
walking, and white matter abnormalities on brain MRI.

Abou Jamra et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the R475X mutation
in affected members of a large consanguineous Syrian family with
autosomal recessive mental retardation. The patients had neonatal
hypotonia, severe motor delay with walking between ages 5 and 7 years,
single words or no speech, growth retardation, stereotypic movements,
and hand flapping. They also shared some dysmorphic features, including
low frontal hairline, synophrys, and microcephaly.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 13
TRAPPC9, ARG570TER

In 3 brothers, born of consanguineous Tunisian parents, with autosomal
recessive mental retardation (MRT13; 613192), Philippe et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous 1708C-T transition in exon 9 of the TRAPPC9
gene, resulting in an arg570-to-ter (R570X) substitution. The mutation
was not found in 1,120 control chromosomes. The protein was not detected
in patient fibroblasts, and the authors postulated nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay. In cultured patient fibroblasts, stimulation with TNF-alpha
(191160) showed a defect in IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008) degradation,
suggesting impaired function of the NF-kappa-B (see 164011) signaling
pathway.

In affected members of an Iranian family (M001) with mental retardation
(613192), previously reported by Najmabadi et al. (2007) as showing
linkage to chromosome 8q24, Mir et al. (2009) identified a 4-bp deletion
(2311delTGTT) in the TRAPPC9 gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination. Affected members had severe nonsyndromic mental
retardation, were ambulatory but nonverbal, and had microcephaly. There
were no seizures or dysmorphic features.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 13
TRAPPC9, IVS17AS, A-C, -2

In 2 sisters, born of unrelated parents from southern Italy, with MRT13
(613192), Marangi et al. (2013) identified a homozygous A-to-C
transversion in intron 17 of the TRAPPC9 gene (2851-2A-C), resulting in
the skipping of exon 18, a frameshift, and premature termination
(Thr951TyrfsTer17). Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
mutation, which was identified by exome sequencing. PCR analysis of
patient cells did not show reduction of the TRAPPC9 transcript in the 2
sisters.

313475	TITLE *313475 SYNAPTOPHYSIN; SYP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptophysin is an integral membrane protein that regulates synaptic
vesicle endocytosis. It is the most abundant synaptic vesicle protein by
mass, accounting for about 10% of total vesicle protein (Kwon and
Chapman, 2011).

CLONING

Sudhof et al. (1987) presented the nucleotide and derived amino acid
sequences of human and rat synaptophysin. The deduced human and rat
proteins contain 296 and 307 amino acids, respectively, and both contain
4 transmembrane domains.

Kwon and Chapman (2011) stated that SYP has a short N-terminal segment,
followed by 4 transmembrane domains and a long C-terminal tail. Both N-
and C-terminal tails are located on the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic
vesicles, and the C-terminal tail is phosphorylated. The 2
intravesicular loops of SYP contain disulfide bonds, and the first loop
has an N-glycosylation site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ozcelik et al. (1990) concluded that the SYP gene has 7 exons
distributed over about 20 kb.

MAPPING

By linkage analysis performed using CEPH families, Ozcelik et al. (1990)
mapped the SYP locus to Xp11.23-p11.22. Regionalization of the gene on
the X chromosome was also done with hamster/human hybrid cells in which
various portions of the human X chromosome were present. Using a RFLP of
SYP, Ozcelik et al. (1990) concluded that SYP lies between TIMP and
DXS14. Ozcelik et al. (1990) mapped the Syp gene to the X chromosome in
the mouse by the study of somatic hybrid cells between mouse and hamster
or rat, with regionalization by the study of hybrid cells containing
rearranged mouse X chromosomes.

Cremin et al. (1993) found that SYP and the TFE3 gene (314310) are
closely linked to the gene for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (301000).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tarpey et al. (2009) sequenced the coding exons of the X chromosome in
208 families with X-linked mental retardation. They identified 4
independent mutations in the SYP gene that segregated precisely with the
phenotype (MRX96; 300802) in affected family members and were not
detected in any unaffected family members. In addition to X-linked
mental retardation, some affected family members had epilepsy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting, McMahon et al. (1996) disrupted the murine Syp
gene. Mutant mice were viable and fertile with no detectable changes in
brain. The authors concluded that Syp, one of the major synaptic vesicle
membrane proteins, is not essential for synaptic transmission. They
hypothesized that the function of Syp is either redundant or that it has
a more subtle function not apparent in the assays used.

Janz et al. (1999) generated mice lacking Syngr1 (603925) and bred them
to the Syp knockout generated by McMahon et al. (1996) to create
double-knockout mice deficient in both Syp and Syngr1. Short- and
long-term synaptic plasticity was severely reduced in the Syngr1/Syp
double-knockout mice.

Using optical imaging and electrophysiologic experiments with cultured
wildtype and Syp -/- mouse hippocampal neurons, Kwon and Chapman (2011)
found that Syp was required for efficient endocytosis of synaptic
vesicles. The defect in Syp -/- neurons was most evident following rapid
and sustained stimulation. Voltage clamp experiments with Syp -/-
neurons showed pronounced synaptic depression during sustained activity
and slower recovery of the recycling vesicle pool following depletion.
Neurotransmitter release probability, postsynaptic responses, and
short-term synaptic plasticity appeared normal in Syp -/- neurons.
Expression of C-terminally truncated Syp in Syp -/- neurons rescued
endocytosis that occurred during the recovery period following activity,
but not endocytosis that occurred during activity. Kwon and Chapman
(2011) concluded that Syp has 2 structural elements that regulate
vesicle retrieval during and after stimulation.

at codon 217 (G217R). The mutation segregated with the phenotype and was
not detected in any unaffected male family members. In addition to
X-linked mental retardation, some affected individuals manifested
epilepsy.

;;K20;;
CYTOKERATIN 20; CK20;;
KERATIN 21, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; KRT21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KRT20 is an integral intermediate filament component and is a major
cytoskeletal keratin of the intestinal epithelium (Moll et al., 1990).

CLONING

Moll et al. (1990) purified KRT20, which they designated protein IT,
from human intestinal mucosa and from cytoskeletal intermediate
filaments. KRT20 has an apparent molecular mass of about 46 kD.
Antibodies raised against KRT20 decorated typical cytokeratin fibril
arrays in normal and transformed intestinal cells. Immunocytochemical
analysis of several human and rat tissues showed that KRT20 is a
prominent component of intestinal and gastric foveolar epithelium,
urothelial umbrella cells, and Merkel cells of epidermis. Sparse
positive epithelial cells were noted in the thymus, bronchus,
gallbladder, and prostate gland.

Using rat Krt21 as probe, Calnek and Quaroni (1993) obtained a partial
cDNA encoding KRT20, which they called CK20, from a colon tumor cell
line cDNA library. The partial sequence, extending from the end of
coil-1a of the alpha-helical rod domain to the polyadenylation tail
region, contains a highly conserved consensus sequence typically found
in the coil-1b alpha-helical rod domain of type I keratins. The partial
KRT20 protein shares 83% amino acid identity with the comparable
sequence of rat Krt21, which the authors renamed Ck20, or Krt20, to
reflect its homology with the human protein. The human and rat proteins
share 86% amino acid identity in the C-terminal nonhelical extension. In
situ hybridization of rat intestine detected expression of Krt20 only
after 20 days gestation (2 days before birth), when the intestinal
epithelium contained terminally differentiated epithelial cells; Krt20
was expressed with Krt8 (148060) by the entire epithelium.

GENE FUNCTION

Moll et al. (1990) found that KRT20 formed heterotypic complexes with
KRT8 in vitro, and the complexes assembled into intermediate filaments
under appropriate conditions.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rogers et al. (2001) mapped the KRT20 gene
to the keratin gene cluster on chromosome 17q12-q21, which contains
KRT12 (601687) and several type I hair keratin genes (see 601077).

;;CHITINASE, MACROPHAGE; CHIT;;
CHITOTRIOSIDASE;;
METHYLUMBELLIFERYL-TETRA-N-ACETYLCHITOTETRAOSIDE HYDROLASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CHIT1 gene encodes plasma methylumbelliferyl
tetra-N-acetylchitotetraoside hydrolase (chitotriosidase), a human
chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14). Chitinases play a role in degrading the chitin
walls of some microorganisms (Boot et al., 1995).

CLONING

Renkema et al. (1995) purified and characterized the chitotriosidase
protein from the spleen of a patient with Gaucher disease (230800) who
had increased serum CHIT1 enzyme activity. Two major isoforms with
isoelectric points of 7.2 and 8.0 and molecular masses of 50 and 39 kD,
respectively, were found to have identical N-terminal amino acid
sequences. An antiserum raised against the purified 39-kD
chitotriosidase precipitated all isozymes. The findings suggested that a
single gene encodes the different isoforms of chitotriosidase. The
authors postulated that the enzyme may be involved in defense against
and in degradation of chitin-containing pathogens such as fungi,
nematodes, and insects.

Boot et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the chitotriosidase
gene from a macrophage cDNA library. The deduced 445-amino acid protein
has a molecular mass of 49 kD, similar to the larger isoform detected by
Renkema et al. (1995). Secretion of active chitotriosidase was obtained
after transient transfection of COS-1 cells with the cloned cDNA.
Chitotriosidase contains several regions with high homology to those
present in chitinases from different species belonging to family 18 of
glycosylhydrolases. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of
chitotriosidase mRNA occurred only at a late stage of differentiation of
monocytes to activated macrophages in cell culture. The authors
speculated that the enzyme may play a role in the degradation of
chitin-containing pathogens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Boot et al. (1998) determined that the CHIT1 gene contains 12 exons and
spans about 20 kb.

MAPPING

Eiberg and Den Tandt (1997) mapped the CHIT locus to chromosome
1q31-qter between flanking markers D1S191 and D1S245. By fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Boot et al. (1998) assigned the CHIT gene to
1q31-q32.

GENE FUNCTION

Hollak et al. (1994) observed a very marked increase (more than
600-fold) of chitotriosidase activity in the plasma of 30 of 32
symptomatic patients with type I Gaucher disease (230800), which is due
to mutation in the gene encoding beta-glucosidase (GBA; 606463). The
increase in plasma chitotriosidase that they observed in Gaucher disease
patients was far more pronounced than the increase in alkaline
phosphatase (ALPL; 171760), which had been used as an important
diagnostic hallmark of the disease. Chitotriosidase activity declined
dramatically during enzyme supplementation therapy. In contrast, 3
GBA-deficient individuals without clinical symptoms had only slight
increases in chitotriosidase. The authors considered it unlikely that
chitotriosidase itself contributes to the clinical presentation of
Gaucher disease. Hollak et al. (1994) noted that the similarity between
lysozyme (LYZ; 153450) and chitotriosidase with respect to catalytic
activity toward particular substrates suggested that the latter may also
function in host defense mechanisms, e.g., through cleavage of bacterial
cell wall polysaccharide. Hollak et al. (1994) suggested that the
macrophages loaded with glucosylceramide in Gaucher disease are the main
source of the plasma enzyme activity. No elevation, or only moderate
elevation, of plasma chitotriosidase was found in a variety of
granulomatous immunologic disorders.

Boot et al. (1995) noted that homologous chitinases in plants are known
to defend against fungal pathogens. The bactericidal function of
lysozyme is also well established; nevertheless, in rabbits an inherited
deficiency in lysozyme occurs that seems to have little consequence for
susceptibility to infections. The diverse array of defense mechanisms of
the immune system in mammals probably renders sufficient tolerance to
defects in single enzymes such as lysozyme and chitotriosidase.

By comparing the antifungal properties of human macrophage
chitotriosidase and its isolated domains, Vandevenne et al. (2011)
showed that the catalytic domain was sufficient for antifungal activity
and tended to be more efficient than the intact enzyme. In contrast, the
chitin-binding domain did not possess any antifungal properties.
Mutations in chitotriosidase that rendered the macrophage enzyme
inactive could be compensated by lysozyme, which had even greater
antifungal activity than chitotriosidase, as well as antibacterial
activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In individuals with chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Boot et al.
(1998) identified a homozygous 24-bp duplication in the CHIT1 gene
(600031.0001). The observed carrier frequency of about 35% indicated
that the duplication is the predominant cause of chitotriosidase
deficiency. The presence of the duplication in individuals from various
ethnic backgrounds suggested that this mutation is relatively old.

Grace et al. (2007) noted that the identification of CHIT1 gene
mutations that alter plasma activity is important for the use of this
biomarker to monitor disease activity and therapeutic response in
Gaucher disease. They genotyped the CHIT1 gene in 320 unrelated patients
with Gaucher disease, including 272 of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Among
all patients, 4% and 37.2% were homozygous and heterozygous,
respectively, for the 24-bp duplication. In addition, Grace et al.
(2007) identified 3 novel mutations in the CHIT1 gene
(600031.0002-600031.0004) in individuals with Gaucher disease and
chitotriosidase deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, 24-BP DUP

Boot et al. (1998) found that chitotriosidase deficiency (614122) can be
caused by a 24-bp duplication in exon 10 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in
activation of a cryptic 3-prime splice site, generating an mRNA with an
in-frame deletion of 87 nucleotides. All chitotriosidase-deficient
individuals tested were homozygous for the duplication. Among 171 Dutch
persons, 6.4% were homozygous and 35.1% were heterozygous for the
mutation. Among 68 Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, 5.9% were homozygous and
33.8% were heterozygous. The mutant chitotriosidase is predicted to lack
amino acids 344-372. On the basis of homology with several chitinases
for which the 3-dimensional structure has been resolved by
crystallographic analysis, the authors predicted that the internal
deletion in the mutant chitotriosidase prevents the formation of a
proper barrel conformation, with resulting loss of chitinolytic
activity.

Among a total of 320 unrelated patients with Gaucher disease (232800),
including 272 of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, Grace et al. (2007) found
that 4% and 37.2% were homozygous or heterozygous for the CHIT1 24-bp
dup, respectively. The allele frequency was 0.227.

.0002
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLY354ARG, LEU385LEU, AND 4-BP DEL

In a Caribbean Hispanic/African type 1 Gaucher disease (230800) patient
with chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified
a complex allele of the CHIT1 gene with 3 different variations in cis: a
1060G-A transition in exon 10 resulting in a gly354-to-arg (G354R)
substitution, a 1155G-A transition in exon 10 resulting in a synonymous
leu385-to-leu (L385L) substitution, and a 4-bp deletion in intron 10
(1156delGTAA). The complex allele was designated 'E/I-10'
(exon/intron-10) allele. The patient was compound heterozygous for the
E/I-10 complex allele and the common 24-bp duplication (600031.0001). In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the complex mutant had
no residual enzyme activity. Further screening identified the complex
allele in individuals of Caribbean Hispanic, Dominican, Caribbean Black,
Puerto Rican, and American Black descent. It was not identified in those
of Caucasian or Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

.0003
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLU74LYS

In a type I Gaucher disease (230800) patient with chitotriosidase
deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified a 220G-A transition
in exon 3 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in a glu74-to-lys (E74K)
substitution. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
E74K mutant had 51% activity compared to control values. The E74K allele
was found in 3 (1.4%) of 208 Ashkenazi Jewish alleles, but not in
non-Ashkenazi Jewish alleles, indicating that it is very rare. This
mutation was not found in normal controls.

.0004
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLY102SER

In 3 Ashkenazi Jewish type I Gaucher disease (230800) patients with
chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified a
304G-A transition in exon 4 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in a
gly102-to-ser (G102S) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies showed that the G102S mutant had 23% activity compared to
control values. The G102S allele had a frequency of 0.2 to 0.3 in
various control populations.

600128	TITLE *600128 PHOSPHODIESTERASE 4C, cAMP-SPECIFIC; PDE4C
;;DUNCE-LIKE PHOSPHODIESTERASE E1, FORMERLY; DPDE1, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cyclic nucleotides are important second messengers that regulate and
mediate a number of cellular responses to extracellular signals, such as
hormones, light, and neurotransmitters. Cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterases (PDEs) regulate the cellular concentrations of cyclic
nucleotides and thereby play a role in signal transduction. PDE4C is a
class IV cAMP-specific PDE (summary by Milatovich et al., 1994).

CLONING

Using degenerate primers based on Drosophila dnc and rat Dpd to amplify
human DPD orthologs, followed by low-stringency hybridization of a brain
cDNA library, Bolger et al. (1993) cloned a partial DPDE1 cDNA, which
they called PDE21. RNase protection assays detected the PDE21 transcript
in retinoblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines, but not in 5 other cell
lines examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sullivan et al. (1999) determined that the PDE4C gene spans at least 38
kb and contains at least 18 exons. Comparison of the published human
PDE4C cDNA sequences with those of the genomic DNA revealed 4
alternatively spliced exons and suggested that the PDE4C gene has at
least 3 alternative promoters.

MAPPING

Using Southern analyses of somatic cell hybrid lines and of recombinant
inbred mouse strains, as well as FISH, Milatovich et al. (1994) mapped
the 4 PDE4 genes in human and mouse. They assigned the PDE4C gene to
human chromosome 19 and mouse chromosome 8.

By FISH, Sullivan et al. (1999) localized the PDE4C gene to 19p13.1.

Sullivan et al. (1999) found that cosmids containing PDE4C also
contained the JUND (165162) and RAB3A (179490) genes. Analysis of the
cosmids showed that 27 kb separate JUND and PDE4C, while only 3.7 kb
separate PDE4C and RAB3A. The 3 genes share the same orientation of
transcription and are arranged in the 5-prime-to-3-prime order as
follows: JUND--PDE4C--RAB3A--tel.

611435	TITLE *611435 DOCKING PROTEIN 3; DOK3
;;DOK-LIKE PROTEIN; DOKL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using Abl (ABL1; 189980) as bait, followed by
5-prime RACE of a mouse liver cDNA library, Cong et al. (1999) cloned
mouse Dok3, which they called Dokl. The deduced 444-amino acid mouse
protein contains an N-terminal PH domain, a central PTB domain, and a
proline-rich C-terminal domain. Dokl is relatively serine/threonine-rich
overall and contains several potential phosphorylation sites for ser/thr
protein kinases. Dokl shares 60% and 57% sequence similarity with p62dok
(DOK1; 602919) over the PH and PTB domains, respectively, with lower
similarity over the C-terminal regions. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues detected several species with high expression in spleen and lung
and low levels in other tissues. RNAse protection studies detected very
high Dokl expression in bone marrow and spleen, low expression in
thymus, and no expression in NIH3T3 cells. Immunofluorescence studies
localized Dokl to the cytoplasm in NIH3T3 cells.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using Csk (124095) as bait, followed by
5-prime RACE of a mouse fetal thymus cDNA library, Lemay et al. (2000)
independently cloned mouse Dok3. RNAse protection assay of mouse tissues
detected high expression in spleen and bone marrow but not in thymus,
with little or no expression in nonlymphoid organs.

MAPPING

Berger et al. (2010) stated that the DOK3 gene maps to chromosome
5q35.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analysis of Dokl and Abl
mutants, Cong et al. (1999) showed that the Dokl PTB domain bound
phosphotyrosines on Abl in a kinase-dependent manner. In addition, the
Dokl PTB domain bound weakly to insulin receptor (INSR; 147670).
Immunoprecipitation and phosphorylation studies showed that Dokl served
as a substrate for phosphorylation by v-Abl, c-Abl, and Bcr-Abl (see
BCR; 151410). Overexpression of Dokl inhibited v-Abl-dependent
activation of MAPK1 (176948) and v-Abl transforming activity.

Lemay et al. (2000) showed that, in response to immunoreceptor
stimulation, Dok3 was tyrosine phosphorylated by Src (190090) family
members Lck (153390), Fyn (137025), and Lyn (165120).
Immunoprecipitation studies showed that Dok3 bound inhibitors SHIP
(INPP5D; 601582) and Csk (124095) but did not bind RasGAP (RASA1;
139150). Dok3 binding to SHIP occurred via the SH2 domain. Dok3 also
bound Csk via the Csk SH2 domain with possible involvement of the Csk
SH3 domain as well. Overexpression of Dok3 in a murine B-cell line
inhibited immunoreceptor-mediated NFAT (see 600490) activation. Lemay et
al. (2000) concluded that Dok3 acts as an adaptor in the recruitment of
inhibitory molecules and may play a role in negative regulation of
immunoreceptor signaling in hematopoietic cells.

Using a constitutively active form of Src, Honma et al. (2006)
identified Grb2 (108355) as a protein that bound Dok3 downstream of its
tyrosine phosphorylation. Dok3 sequestered Grb2 from Shc (600560),
resulting in negative regulation of the Ras-Erk pathway.

ANIMAL MODEL

Berger et al. (2010) found that mice with knockout of Dok1 (602919),
Dok2 (604997), or Dok3 each developed lung adenocarcinoma (211980). Mice
with double-knockouts of different combinations of these 3 genes
developed lung adenocarcinoma at an earlier age and with high
penetrance, suggesting that the proteins have partially redundant or
overlapping functions. Compared to wildtype lung tissue, Dok-mutant
tumors showed moderate staining for phosphorylated Akt (164730) and
strong staining for phosphorylated Erk (176872). Immunohistochemical
studies on isolated cells showed that the tumor cells arose from a
population of bronchioalveolar stem cells with inactivation of the Dok
proteins. These findings were consistent with a model of tumorigenesis
in which inactivation of the Dok1, Dok2, and Dok3 genes leads to
hyperactivation of Akt and Erk, and an expansion of the stem cells that
differentiate into alveolar type II cells.

DESCRIPTION See 188830. Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases is
essential for sperm motility. A cAMP-dependent protein kinase is bound
to sperm flagella by a regulatory subunit (RII). Oyen et al. (1989)
observed high testis-specific expression of a human homolog to the rat
RII-alpha mRNA induced in haploid germ cells. They cloned a human cDNA
that encodes a 404-amino acid polypeptide with a region (amino acids
45-75) divergent from that of the previously published mouse and rat
sequences.

By PCR and Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrid mapping panels
and by radiation hybrid analysis, Tasken et al. (1998) mapped the
PRKAR2A gene to chromosome 3p21.3-p21.2.

604100	TITLE *604100 GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR, METABOTROPIC, 4; GRM4
;;MGLUR4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

L-glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central
nervous system and activates both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate
receptors, such as GRM4. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs),
which are G protein-coupled receptors, have been divided into 3 groups
on the basis of sequence homology, putative signal transduction
mechanisms, and pharmacologic properties. Group II and group III mGluRs
are linked to the inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade, but differ in
their agonist selectivities. Group III agonists include
L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (L-AP4) and L-serine-O-phosphate (summary
by Wu et al., 1998).

CLONING

Using a PCR strategy with primers based on consensus regions of rat
mGluR1-5, Makoff et al. (1996) isolated partial cDNAs corresponding to
the human homologs of these genes. By probing a cerebellum library with
the partial human mGluR4 cDNA, the authors isolated additional mGluR4
cDNAs which between them contained the complete coding sequence for the
human protein. The predicted 912-amino acid human mGluR4 protein shares
90% identity with rat mGluR4. Northern blot analysis of human tissues
revealed that the approximately 5-kb mGluR4 mRNA was only expressed in
brain. In situ hybridization to brain tissues indicated that human
mGluR4 mRNA, like that of rat mGluR4, has a narrow distribution. In both
organisms, the highest level of expression was detected in the granule
cells of the cerebellum. Wu et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding 3
human group III mGluRs, mGluR4, mGluR7 (604101) and mGluR8 (601116), and
compared the pharmacologic properties of these receptors.

By database analysis, Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) identified GRM4
orthologs in mouse and fish. The deduced mouse protein contains 912
amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) determined that the GRM4 gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

Barbon et al. (2000) mapped the GRM4 gene to chromosome 6p21.3 by
radiation hybrid mapping.

Bjarnadottir et al. (2005) mapped the mouse Grm4 gene to chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

To provide a better understanding of the L-AP4 receptors, Pekhletski et
al. (1996) generated knockout mice lacking the mGluR4 gene. The mutant
mice did not display any gross motor abnormalities, impairments of
novelty-induced exploratory behaviors, or alterations in fine motor
coordination. However, they were deficient on the rotating rod
motor-learning test, suggesting that they may have an impaired ability
to learn complex motor tasks. Analysis of presynaptic short-term
synaptic plasticity at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse
demonstrated that paired-pulse facilitation and post-tetanic
potentiation were impaired in the mutant mice, although long-term
depression was unaffected. Pekhletski et al. (1996) concluded that an
important function of mGluR4 is to provide a presynaptic mechanism for
maintaining synaptic efficacy during repetitive activation, and that the
presence of mGluR4 at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse is
required for maintaining normal motor function. Gerlai et al. (1998)
found that mGluR4 mutant mice exhibited significantly accelerated
learning performance in a spatial reversal learning task. In a probe
trial administered 6 weeks posttraining, the mice showed impaired
spatial accuracy. These results suggested that mGluR4 mutant mice differ
in their ability to learn and integrate new spatial information into
previously formed memory traces and that their use of stored spatial
information is altered.

Fallarino et al. (2010) observed that mGluR4-null mice were markedly
vulnerable to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse
model of multiple sclerosis (MS; 126200), and developed immune responses
dominated by IL17 (603149)-producing T helper (TH17) cells. MGluR4 was
constitutively expressed on dendritic cells isolated from wildtype mice.
Signaling through mGluR4 decreased commitment to the TH17 phenotype by
decreasing intracellular cAMP. Treatment of wildtype mice with a
selective mGluR4 enhancer increased EAE resistance and offered a
protective response via a shift toward regulatory CD4+ T cells. In
contrast, dendritic cells from mGluR4-null mice showed defective mGluR4
signaling with resultant bias toward the TH17 phenotype. The findings
provided evidence that glutamate acts at the interface between the
nervous and immune systems, with mGluR4 present on dendritic cells in
the central nervous system. Fallarino et al. (2010) suggested that the
high amounts of glutamate associated with neuroinflammation might
reflect a counterregulatory mechanism that is protective in nature by
decreasing activation of pathogenic IL17-producing T cells.

;;EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX GLYCOPROTEIN ES/130, CHICKEN, HOMOLOG OF; ES130
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To clone genes for proteins involved in the formation of cardiac
mesenchyme, Rezaee et al. (1993) used anti-cardiac extracellular matrix
polyclonal antibodies to screen an embryonic chicken cardiocyte
expression library. They used cultured chicken embryonic cardiocytes
because the conditioned medium from such cultures induced
epithelial/mesenchymal transformation; also, it was easier to obtain
good quality RNA from cultured tissue. They identified a 130-kD protein
and designated the protein ES/130. ES/130, which is expressed in
endocardial cushions, was viewed as a candidate for a central role in
atrioventricular septal defect because expression of the gene in the
myocardium induces expression of the same gene in the endocardium.
Basson et al. (1996) stated that ES/130 is also expressed in noncardiac
chicken tissues such as limb and notochord.

Basson et al. (1996) identified the human homolog of chicken ES/130.
RT-PCR studies revealed that human ES130 is expressed in both fetal and
adult tissue and that its expression in the left ventricle is increased
in the failing adult heart.

MAPPING

Basson et al. (1996) localized the human ES/130 gene to chromosome
20p12-p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

- Exclusion Studies

By FISH analysis of individuals with Alagille syndrome (118450) and
deletions of 20p12, Basson et al. (1996) excluded ES/130 as a candidate
gene for this disorder.

116945	TITLE *116945 MINICHROMOSOME MAINTENANCE, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 2; MCM2
;;MITOTIN;;
CELL DIVISION CYCLE-LIKE 1; CDCL1;;
NUCLEAR PROTEIN BM28; BM28
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MCM2, also called CDCL1 and BM28, is a human nuclear protein that plays
an important role in 2 crucial steps of the cell cycle, namely, onset of
DNA replication and cell division (Mincheva et al., 1994). It is similar
to members of the family of early S-phase proteins.

CLONING

The replication of DNA occurs only once per cell cycle in eukaryotes.
Blow and Laskey (1988) attempted to explain this tight control by
proposing the existence of a hypothetical licensing factor that would
bind to chromatin during mitosis to permit DNA replication during the
ensuing S phase in Xenopus egg extracts. Kubota et al. (1995), Chong et
al. (1995), and Madine et al. (1995) identified a replication licensing
activity in a complex containing MCM/P1 family proteins in Xenopus
oocytes. Burkhart et al. (1995) showed that human MCM2 and MCM5 (602696)
proteins form a complex. Hu et al. (1993) reported cDNA sequences for 5
MCM/P1 family members.

MAPPING

Using plasmid DNA containing the complete coding sequence of the CDCL1
gene as a probe for fluorescence in situ hybridization, Mincheva et al.
(1994) mapped the gene to 3q21. From its localization, CDCL1 became a
candidate for an oncogene affected by chromosomal breaks in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML).

GENE FUNCTION

Tsuruga et al. (1997) reported the comparative analysis of the human MCM
proteins MCM2, MCM3 (602693), MCM5, and MCM7 (600592). The 4 MCM
proteins underwent unequal regulation, suggesting that they play
somewhat distinct roles in the regulation of the mammalian cell cycle.
The mRNA levels of these genes underwent cell cycle-dependent
oscillations with a peak at G1/S phase; they may be regulated by E2F
motifs (see E2F1; 189971), 2 of which were detected in the 5-prime
regulatory region of the MCM5 gene. In contrast, the levels of these MCM
proteins remained rather constant during the HeLa cell cycle. However,
their levels gradually increased in a variable manner as normal cells
progressed from G0 into the G1/S phase. In the G0 stage, the MCM2 and
MCM5 proteins were much less abundant than the MCM7 and MCM3 proteins.
This suggests that the MCM proteins are not present in stoichiometric
amounts and that only a proportion of these molecules actively
participate in cell cycle regulation as part of MCM complexes.

Using an improved method for constructing conditional degron mutants,
Labib et al. (2000) demonstrated that depletion of minichromosome
maintenance protein complexes after initiation irreversibly blocks the
progression of replication forks in S. cerevisiae. Their experiments
demonstrated that MCM complex is loaded at origins before initiation and
is essential for elongation. Disruption of any one of the MCMs resulted
in cells that were unable to complete the S phase, indicating that all
MCM proteins are equally important for chromosome replication to
continue after the activation of early origins of DNA replication. Labib
et al. (2000) concluded that restricting MCM loading to the G1 phase
ensures that initiation and elongation occur just once per cell cycle.

The MCM2-7 complex is comprised of 6 subunits, MCM2 through MCM7, and is
a ring-shaped heterohexameric ATPase involved in DNA replication. In
Xenopus egg extracts, Pacek et al. (2006) showed that the MCM2-7
complex, the GINS complex (see GINS1; 610608), and Cdc45 (CDC45L;
603465) were enriched at stalled replication forks. They proposed that
these components unwind DNA and separate DNA strands at replication
forks.

Groth et al. (2007) characterized the complex in which the human histone
chaperone ASF1 (see 609189) and MCM2-7, the putative replicative
helicase, are connected through a histone H3-H4 bridge. Depletion of
ASF1 by RNA interference impeded DNA unwinding at replication sites, and
similar defects arose from overproduction of new histone H3-H4 that
compromised ASF1 function. Groth et al. (2007) concluded that their data
link ASF1 chaperone function, histone supply, and replicative unwinding
of DNA in chromatin. Groth et al. (2007) proposed that ASF1, as a
histone acceptor and donor, handles parental and new histones at the
replication fork via an ASF1-(H3-H4)-MCM2-7 intermediate and thus
provides a means to fine-tune replication fork progression and histone
supply and demand.

NOMENCLATURE

This gene has also been referred to as cdc19 and D3S3194. See MCM7
(600592), which also has been referred to as MCM2.

604064	TITLE *604064 ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 4; ATF4
;;CYCLIC AMP RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 2; CREB2;;
TAX-RESPONSIVE ENHANCER ELEMENT B67; TAXREB67
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATF4 belongs to the large ATF/CREB family of transcription factors.
These proteins bind DNA via their basic region and dimerize via their
leucine zipper domain to form a variety of homo- and heterodimers to
regulate gene transcription (De Angelis et al., 2003).

CLONING

An activating transcription factor (ATF)-binding site is a promoter
element present in a wide variety of viral and cellular genes, including
E1A-inducible adenoviral genes and cAMP-inducible cellular genes. Hai et
al. (1989) identified cDNAs encoding 8 different human ATF
consensus-binding proteins, including a partial cDNA corresponding to
ATF4. They found that members of this family share significant sequence
similarity within a leucine zipper DNA-binding motif and an adjacent
basic region; the proteins show little similarity outside of these
regions.

The cAMP response element (CRE) is an octanucleotide motif that mediates
diverse transcriptional regulatory effects. By screening a Jurkat T-cell
line expression library for the ability to bind CRE, Karpinski et al.
(1992) isolated a full-length cDNA corresponding to ATF4, which they
called CREB2 (CRE-binding protein-2). The predicted protein contains 351
amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 1.5-kb CREB2 mRNA
was expressed in all human tumor cell lines and mouse organs tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Karpinski et al. (1992) found that, unlike CREB (123810), which
activates transcription from CRE-containing promoters, CREB2 functions
as a specific repressor of CRE-dependent transcription. The
transcriptional repressor activity resides within the C-terminal leucine
zipper and basic domain region of the CREB2 protein.

The p40tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)
activates HTLV-1 viral transcription in trans through tax-responsive
enhancers in the long terminal repeats. Tsujimoto et al. (1991)
identified ATF4 as TAXREB67, a protein that binds to the tax-responsive
enhancer element in HTLV-1.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, He et al. (2001) found that mouse Nrf2
(NFE2L2; 600492) interacted with rat Atf4. Coimmunoprecipitation and
mammalian 2-hybrid analyses confirmed the interaction. An Nrf2-Atf4
dimer bound a stress response element (StRE) sequence from an Nrf2
target gene, Ho1 (HMOX1; 141250). CdCl2, an Ho1 inducer, increased
expression of Atf4 in mouse hepatoma cells prior to induction of Ho1. A
dominant-negative Atf4 mutant inhibited basal and CdCl2-induced
expression of an StRE-dependent construct in hepatoma cells, but it only
inhibited basal expression in a human mammary epithelial cell line. He
et al. (2001) concluded that ATF4 regulates HO1 expression in a
cell-specific manner, possibly in a complex with NRF2.

Siu et al. (2002) presented evidence that ATF4 binds nutrient-sensing
response element-1 (NSRE1) in the human asparagine synthetase (ASNS;
108370) gene and activates ASNS transcription in response to nutrient
stress.

Bagheri-Yarmand et al. (2003) found that expression of Atf4 was high in
virgin mouse mammary glands and in pregnant mammary glands, but it was
dramatically reduced during lactation and higher after weaning.
Transgenic mice overexpressing Atf4 in mammary epithelium showed
decreased proliferation and impaired differentiation of alveolar
epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation. In addition, Atf4
overexpression induced apoptosis and accelerated involution of the
mammary gland, suggesting a role for ATF4 in the regulation of normal
mammary gland involution.

De Angelis et al. (2003) showed that human ATF4 and RBP3 (E2F1; 189971)
dimerized in vitro and in vivo and that RBP3 enhanced ATF4
transactivating activity. Expression of both proteins increased during
differentiation of a mouse myogenic cell line.

ATF4 has 2 upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are conserved in vertebrates. The
more 3-prime uORF, uORF2, extends into the coding region of full-length
ATF4. Independently, Lu et al. (2004) and Vattem and Wek (2004) found
that scanning ribosomes initiated translation at both uORFs of mouse
Atf4, and that ribosomes that translated uORF1 efficiently reinitiated
translation at downstream AUGs. In unstressed mouse fibroblasts, low
levels of phosphorylated Eif2 (see EIF2S1; 603907) favored early
capacitation of reinitiating ribosomes, directing them to the inhibitory
uORF2 downstream of uORF1, which precluded translation of Atf4 and
repressed the integrated stress response. In stressed cells, high levels
of phosphorylated Eif2 delayed capacitation of reinitiating ribosomes,
favoring reinitiation at the Atf4 coding sequence over uORF2, which
permitted Atf4 expression and activated the integrated stress response.

Using Rsk2 (300075) -/- mice, Yang et al. (2004) showed that RSK2 is
required for osteoblast differentiation and function. They identified
the transcription factor ATF4 as a critical substrate of RSK2 that is
required for the timely onset of osteoblast differentiation, for
terminal differentiation of osteoblasts, and for osteoblast-specific
gene expression. Additionally, RSK2 and ATF4 were found to
posttranscriptionally regulate the synthesis of type I collagen (see
120150), the main constituent of the bone matrix. Accordingly, Atf4
deficiency in mice resulted in delayed bone formation during embryonic
development and low bone mass throughout postnatal life. Yang et al.
(2004) concluded that ATF4 is a critical regulator of osteoblast
differentiation and function and that lack of ATF4 phosphorylation by
RSK2 may contribute to the skeletal phenotype of Coffin-Lowry syndrome
(303600).

Blais et al. (2004) determined that EIF2-alpha (EIF2S1), PERK (EIF2AK3;
604032), ATF4, and GADD34 (PPP1R15A; 611048) are involved in an
integrated adaptive response to hypoxic stress in HeLa cells.

Sayer et al. (2006) performed a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal
brain expression library and identified ATF4 as a direct interaction
partner of CEP290 (NPHP6; 610142). The protein-interaction domains
mapped to the N-terminal third of CEP290, encoded by exons 2 through 21,
and the C-terminal two-thirds of ATF4. To confirm that CEP290 and ATF4
interact physiologically in vivo, Sayer et al. (2006) performed
coimmunoprecipitation experiments using bovine retina extracts.
Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that endogenous ATF4 can be
immunoprecipitated using an antibody to CEP290 but not using a control
IgG. Reverse coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that antibody to
ATF4 can also precipitate endogenous CEP290.

Lin et al. (2010) showed that although Skp2 (601436) inactivation on its
own does not induce cellular senescence, aberrant protooncogenic signals
as well as inactivation of tumor suppressor genes do trigger a potent,
tumor-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2.
Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic stress-driven senescence
neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf) (see 600160)-p53 (191170)
pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Aft4, p27 (600778), and
p21 (116899). Lin et al. (2010) further demonstrated that genetic Skp2
inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in
which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex
inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten (601728)-deficient
cells and tumor regression in preclinical studies. Lin et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings provided proof-of-principle evidence that
pharmacologic inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for
cancer prevention and therapy.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ATF4
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP stSG29796).

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (1998) used gene targeting to generate mice lacking Atf4.
They found that Atf4-deficient mice exhibited severe microphthalmia. The
Atf4-deficient eyes revealed a normal gross lens structure up to
embryonic day 14.5, after which the lens degenerated due to apoptosis
without the formation of lens secondary fiber cells. Retinal development
was normal in the mutant mice. The lens-specific expression of Atf4 in
the mutant mice led not only to the recovery of lens secondary fibers
but also to the induction of hyperplasia of these fibers. Tanaka et al.
(1998) concluded that ATF4 is essential for the later stages of lens
fiber cell differentiation.

NOMENCLATURE

The ATF4 gene, which Karpinski et al. (1992) referred to as CREB2,
should not be confused with the ATF2 gene (123811), which was formerly
known as CREB2.

;;CD28 ANTIGEN LIGAND 2; CD28LG2;;
B-LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION ANTIGEN B7-2; LAB7-2;;
B72 ANTIGEN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Induction of an immune response requires that T cells receive 2 sets of
signals from antigen-presenting cells. The first signal is delivered
through the T-cell receptor complex, while the second is provided by the
B-cell activation antigens B7-1, or CD80 (112203), and B7-2, or CD86, by
interaction with the T-cell surface molecules, CD28 (186760) and CTLA4
(123890). A cDNA for B7-2 was obtained by Freeman et al. (1993). B7-2
mRNA is constitutively expressed in unstimulated B cells. The predicted
protein is a type I membrane protein of the immunoglobin superfamily.

Jeannin et al. (2000) detected a soluble form of CD86 in human serum
that could be generated either by shedding of the membrane form or
through alternative splicing. RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of
2 transcripts in nonstimulated monocytes but only the full-length
transmembrane form in activated monocytes. The smallest transcript, 828
bp, which the authors termed CD86deltaTM, has a deletion from nucleotide
686 to nucleotide 829 (i.e., exon 6) and encodes a 275-amino acid
protein. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis detected expression of CD86
and CD86deltaTM in COS cells as 65- and 48-kD proteins, respectively.
FACS analysis detected only CD86 transfected cells and ELISA analysis
detected only CD86deltaTM in cell-free supernatants. Binding analysis
demonstrated that CD86deltaTM binds to CD28- or CTLA4-expressing cells.
Functional analysis indicated that CD86deltaTM enhances proliferation
and cytokine production by both naive and memory T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Resting eosinophils express neither MHC class II proteins or
costimulatory B7 molecules and fail to induce proliferation of T cells
to antigens. Celestin et al. (2001) reported that IL3 (147740) induces
expression of HLA-DR and B7.2 on eosinophils, but, unlike IL5 (147580)
and GMCSF (CSF2; 138960), it does not induce expression of B7.1.
IL3-treated eosinophils supported modest T-cell proliferation in
response to superantigen toxic shock syndrome-1 antigen, as well as
proliferation of HLA-DR-restricted T-cell clones to tetanus toxoid (TT)
and influenza virus antigenic peptides. The response was blocked by
anti-B7.2 monoclonal antibody. IL3-treated eosinophils were unable to
present native TT antigen to either resting or TT-specific cloned T
cells. Parallel experiments established that IL5 and GMCSF induce T-cell
proliferation to peptides but not to native TT antigen. Celestin et al.
(2001) suggested that eosinophils activated by IL3 may contribute to
T-cell activation in allergic and parasitic diseases by presenting
superantigens and peptides to T cells.

An immune response against thyroid carcinoma could be important for
long-term survival. Gupta et al. (2001) reported that infiltration of
thyroid carcinoma by proliferating lymphocytes is associated with
improved disease-free survival. Shah et al. (2002) hypothesized that the
antigen presentation coactivators B71 (112203) and B72, which are
important in other immune-mediated thyroid diseases, might be important
in lymphocytic infiltration of thyroid carcinoma. To test this, they
determined B71 and B72 expression by immunohistochemistry in 27
papillary (PTC; 188550) and 8 follicular (FTC; 188470) thyroid
carcinomas and 9 benign thyroid lesions. B72 expression was of similar
intensity in benign and malignant tumors, but was more intense than in
presumably normal adjacent thyroid. B72 expression also correlated with
the number of tumor-associated lymphocytes per high-power field.
Recurrence developed exclusively from tumors that expressed B72, and
intense B72 expression was associated with a reduced probability of
remission. Shah et al. (2002) concluded that these data support the
hypothesis that the antigen presentation coactivators B71 and B72 may be
important for lymphocytic infiltration and the immune response against
thyroid carcinoma.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Schwartz et al. (2001) reported the crystal structure of the complex
between the disulfide-linked homodimer of human CTLA4 (123890) and the
receptor-binding domain of human B7.2 at 3.2-angstrom resolution.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jellis et al. (1995) isolated the gene for B7-2, which is composed of 8
exons and spans more than 22 kb. The authors found that alternatively
spliced cDNAs result from the use of either exon 1 or 2. Exon 3
corresponds to the signal peptide, exon 4 to an IgV-like domain, exon 5
to an IgC-like domain and exon 6 corresponds to the transmembrane region
and part of the cytoplasmic tail. Exons 7 and 8 encode the remainder of
the tail.

MAPPING

Reeves et al. (1997) demonstrated that the CD86 and CD80 genes are
linked on human chromosome 3 and mouse chromosome 16. Reeves et al.
(1997) used fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping to show that
CD86, like CD80, maps to human 3q21 and mouse chromosome 16, band B5.

605313	TITLE *605313 RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 8A; RBM8A
;;RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 8; RBM8;;
Y14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RBM8A gene encodes Y14, 1 of the 4 components of the exon-junction
complex (EJC), which is involved in basic cellular functions such as
nuclear export and subcellular localization of specific transcripts,
translational enhancement, and nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD)
(summary by Albers et al., 2012).

CLONING

Mago nashi (MAGOH; 602603), meaning grandchildless, is the homolog of a
Drosophila protein required for normal germ plasm development in fly
embryos. By performing a yeast 2-hybrid screen on a fetal brain cDNA
library with MAGOH as the bait, Zhao et al. (2000) recovered a cDNA
encoding RBM8. The 173-amino acid RBM8 protein is more than 93%
identical to the mouse and zebrafish sequences, and the mouse
differences are all accounted for by an 11-amino acid N-terminal
insertion and another single-residue insertion in the mouse sequence.
Exchange partner and GST pull-down assays confirmed the MAGOH-RBM8
interaction and showed that RBM8 is expressed as a 26-kD protein,
slightly larger than the predicted mass of 23 kD. Northern blot analysis
detected a major RBM8 transcript of less than 1.0 kb in all tissues
tested, with weakest expression in pancreas and brain.

By searching an EST database for homologs of the gonadotropin-releasing
hormone receptor (GNRHR; 138850), followed by 5-prime RACE on a skeletal
muscle cDNA library, Conklin et al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding
RBM8. Northern blot analysis detected a major 0.9-kb transcript in all
tissues tested. Sequence analysis of the 174-amino acid protein
predicted an RNA-binding domain, which is composed of 2 amphipathic
alpha helices packed against a 4-stranded beta sheet, and a C-terminal
arg-rich segment.

By performing a yeast 2-hybrid screen on a HeLa cell cDNA library to
identify potential cargoes for RAN-binding protein-5 (RANBP5; 602008),
Kataoka et al. (2000) isolated cDNAs encoding RBM8, which they called
Y14. RBM8 encodes a predicted 174-amino acid, predominantly nuclear
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein.

Salicioni et al. (2000) used a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify cDNAs
from a human fetal brain cDNA library encoding proteins that interact
with OVCA1 (603527), a candidate tumor suppressor protein. They
identified cDNAs, which they initially referred to as BOV1, that
appeared to encode a new member of the conserved RNA-binding motif
protein family. One of the cDNAs isolated was identical to RBM8A;
another, designated RBM8B, was thought by Salicioni et al. (2000) to be
a novel functional gene, but was later determined to be a pseudogene.
Northern blot analysis revealed that BOV1 is ubiquitously expressed as 3
distinct mRNA species of 1, 3.2, and 5.8 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Kataoka et al. (2000) found that RBM8 associates preferentially with
mRNAs produced by splicing and not with pre-mRNAs, introns, or mRNAs
produced from intronless cDNAs. RBM8 associates with both nuclear mRNAs
and newly exported cytoplasmic mRNAs. Splicing of a single intron is
sufficient for RBM8 association. RBM8-containing nuclear complexes are
different from general heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)
complexes in that they contain hnRNP proteins and several unique
proteins, including the mRNA export factor TAP (NXF1; 602647). Thus,
RBM8 defines novel intermediates in the pathway of gene expression,
postsplicing nuclear preexport mRNPs, and newly exported cytoplasmic
mRNPs, whose composition is established by splicing. These findings
suggested that pre-mRNA splicing imprints mRNA with a unique set of
proteins that persists in the cytoplasm and thereby communicates the
history of the transcript.

Kim et al. (2001) analyzed the binding of RBM8A, which they called Y14,
to pre-mRNAs injected into nuclei of Xenopus oocytes. They found that
RBM8A stably bound mRNA sequences approximately -20 nucleotides upstream
of exon-exon junctions.

Oskar mRNA localization at the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte
is essential for germline and abdomen formation in the future embryo.
Y14/RBM8 and MAGOH (602603), human homologs of nuclear shuttling
proteins required for oskar mRNA localization, are core components of
the exon-exon junction complex (EJC). The EJC is deposited on mRNAs in a
splicing-dependent manner, 20 to 24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon
junctions, independent of the RNA sequence. This indicates a possible
role of splicing in oskar mRNA localization, challenging the established
notion that the oskar 3-prime untranslated region is sufficient for this
process. Hachet and Ephrussi (2004) demonstrated that splicing at the
first exon-exon junction of oskar RNA is essential for oskar mRNA
localization at the posterior pole. They revisited the issue of
sufficiency of the oskar 3-prime untranslated region for posterior
localization and showed that the localization of unrelated transcripts
bearing the oskar 3-prime untranslated region is mediated by endogenous
oskar mRNA. Hachet and Ephrussi (2004) concluded that their results
revealed an important new function for splicing: regulation of messenger
ribonucleoprotein complex assembly and organization for mRNA cytoplasmic
localization.

Albers et al. (2012) showed that RBM8A is expressed in all hematopoietic
lineages, and that its encoded protein sequence is highly conserved
between species. Albers et al. (2012) suggested that, given the
important functions of the EJC, it is likely that a complete lack of Y14
in humans is not viable. Indeed, in Drosophila melanogaster, knockdown
of its ortholog tsu leads to major defects in abdomen formation (Hachet
and Ephrussi, 2001), and Albers et al. (2012) found that knockdown of
the orthologous rbm8a transcript in Danio rerio using antisense
morpholinos resulted in extreme malformations and death at 2 days
post-fertilization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Albers et al. (2012) determined that the RBM8A gene comprises 6 exons.

MAPPING

By PCR and radiation hybrid analysis, Zhao et al. (2000) mapped the
RBM8A gene to 1q12. Conklin et al. (2000) mapped the RBM8 gene to
14q21-q23 using radiation hybrid analysis, but it appears that the
sequence on chromosome 14 is a pseudogene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

It had been shown that an inherited or de novo deletion on chromosome
1q21.1 (Klopocki et al., 2007) is found in the majority of individuals
with TAR syndrome (274000), but the apparent autosomal recessive nature
of that syndrome required the existence of an additional causative
allele. To identify the additional causative allele, Albers et al.
(2012) selected 5 individuals with TAR of European ancestry who had the
1q21.1 deletion and sequenced their exomes, but were unable to find
TAR-associated coding mutations in any gene. However, 4 of the cases
carried the minor allele of a low-frequency SNP in the 5-prime UTR of
the RBM8A gene (dbSNP rs139428292; 605313.0001), while the remaining
case carried a previously unknown SNP in the first intron of the same
gene (605313.0002). Genotyping by Sanger sequencing of another 48 cases
of European ancestry identified the 2 SNPs in 35 and 11 samples,
respectively. In the 25 trios where the deletion in the child was not a
de novo event, Albers et al. (2012) confirmed that the deletion and the
newly identified SNPs were inherited from different parents. The minor
allele frequency of the 5-prime UTR and intronic SNPs were 3.05% and
0.42%, respectively, in 7,504 healthy individuals of the Cambridge
BioResource, and the deletion was absent from 5,919 shared healthy
controls of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. There were 2 TAR
cases who did not carry the 1q21.1 deletion but were found to carry the
5-prime UTR SNP. Albers et al. (2012) identified a 4-bp frameshift
insertion at the start of the fourth exon (605313.0003) in the first
case and established that the noncoding SNP and insertion were on
different chromosomes; in the second case, they identified a nonsense
mutation in the last exon of RBM8A (605313.0004). Both mutations were
absent from 458 exome samples of the 1000 Genomes Project and 416
samples from the Cohorte Lausannoise. Albers et al. (2012) concluded
that in the vast majority of cases, compound inheritance of a rare null
allele (containing a deletion, frameshift mutation, or encoded premature
stop codon) and 1 of 2 low-frequency noncoding SNPs in RBM8A causes TAR
syndrome. Albers et al. (2012) showed that the 2 regulatory SNPs result
in diminished RBM8A transcription in vitro and that expression of Y14 is
reduced in platelets from individuals with TAR. Albers et al. (2012)
concluded that their data implicated Y14 insufficiency and, presumably,
an EJC defect as the cause of TAR syndrome.

Given the expression of Y14 in hematopoietic lineages and major defects
observed in Drosophila and zebrafish resulting from knockdown of the
respective Y14 orthologs, Albers et al. (2012) suggested that their
results are compatible with both a dose-effect phenomenon and a
lineage-dependent deficiency in Y14. The possibility of a dose-effect
phenomenon was supported by the observation that simple
haploinsufficiency is not sufficient to create an aberrant phenotype, as
evidenced by the seemingly healthy carriers of the 1q21.1 deletion.
Albers et al. (2012) did not observe an effect on platelet count for
either the 5-prime UTR or the intronic SNP in the 403 and 59 individuals
from the Cambridge BioResource who carried the minor allele for each
SNP, respectively. The authors suggested that compound inheritance of a
null allele together with the minor allele of 1 of the 2 regulatory SNPs
brings Y14 levels below a critical threshold in certain tissues. The
cell line-dependent effect shown in luciferase assays suggested a
combinatorial binding of transcription factors, including EVI1 (165215),
in the context of regulatory SNPs.

RBM8A, 5-PRIME UTR, G-A (dbSNP rs139428292)

In 41 of 55 patients with thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome (TAR;
274000), Albers et al. (2012) identified the presence of the minor
allele (A) of a G-to-A SNP, dbSNP rs139428292 (chr1:145507646, GRCh37),
in the 5-prime untranslated region (UTR) of the RBM8A gene. In 39 of
these patients this SNP was found in compound heterozygosity with a
200-kb deletion including the RBM8A gene and 10 other genes; in 2
patients the SNP occurred in compound heterozygosity with 1 of 2 null
mutations in the RBM8A gene. The minor allele frequency of the SNP dbSNP
rs139428292 was 3.05% in 7,504 healthy individuals of the Cambridge
BioResource. This SNP resulted in diminished RBM8A transcription in
vitro.

allele (C) of a SNP in the first intron of the RBM8A gene
(chr1:145507765, GRCh37). The SNP occurred in compound heterozygosity
with a 200-kb deletion including the RBM8A gene and 10 other genes. The
minor allele frequency of this intronic SNP was 0.42% in 7,504 healthy
individuals of the Cambridge BioResource. This SNP resulted in
diminished RBM8A transcription in vitro.

608122	TITLE *608122 PARVIN, GAMMA; PARVG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the parvin family, including PARVG, are actin-binding
proteins associated with focal contacts.

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to mouse Parva
(608120), followed by RT-PCR of a human T-cell line cDNA library, Olski
et al. (2001) cloned human PARVG. Mouse and human PARVG encode a deduced
331-amino acid protein that contains a single actin-binding domain made
up of 2 calponin (600806) homology domains separated by a linker region.
Unlike PARVA and PARVB (608121), the N terminus of PARVG does not
contain nuclear localization signals or SH3-binding domains.

By analyzing PARVG ESTs, Korenbaum et al. (2001) identified
alternatively spliced sequences and a single polyadenylation site.
Northern blot analysis revealed a strong smeared signal in heart, liver,
and several other tissues. Bands of about 1.6 and 4.0 kb were detected
in peripheral blood and spleen. RNA dot blot analysis detected highest
expression in lymphatic organs (spleen, thymus, lymph node, bone marrow,
and peripheral blood leukocytes) and moderate expression in the
digestive tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ileocecum, and
appendix), lung, and liver. In contrast, mouse Parvg showed highest
expression in testis, where there were at least 6 mRNA species. A 2.8-kb
Parvg transcript was expressed highly in spleen, moderately in lung, and
weakly in brain and heart. Parvg was expressed throughout mouse
embryonic development, with downregulation at embryonic day 11.
Korenbaum et al. (2001) stated that fluorescence-tagged PARVG, like
PARVA, localized at focal contacts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Korenbaum et al. (2001) determined that the PARVG gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Korenbaum et al. (2001) mapped the PARVG
gene to chromosome 22q13.31, where it lies head to tail about 12 kb
telomeric to the PARVB gene.

;;GNRHR1;;
GRHR;;
LUTEINIZING HORMONE-RELEASING HORMONE RECEPTOR; LHRHR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH; 152760), a hypothalamic
decapeptide, is a key neuroregulator of the reproductive process. It is
synthesized by hypothalamic neurons, secreted in a pulsatile manner, and
carried to the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland by way of the
hypothalamohypophyseal portal circulation. The primary site of action of
GNRH in the pituitary gland is the gonadotrope, the cell that expresses
GNRH receptors and secretes gonadotropic hormones, which in turn
regulate gametogenic and hormonal functions of the gonads. GNRH receptor
is a member of the G protein-coupled, Ca(2+)-dependent family of
receptors. Located on the cell surface of pituitary gonadotropes, GNRHR
transduces signals from GNRH and modulates the synthesis and secretion
of luteinizing hormone (152780) and follicle-stimulating hormone
(136530).

CLONING

Kakar et al. (1992) isolated a cDNA for the GNRH receptor and showed
that it encodes a protein with a transmembrane topology similar to that
of other G protein-coupled 7-transmembrane-domain receptors.

Grosse et al. (1997) used RT-PCR of human pituitary poly(A)+ RNA to
clone the full-length GNRHR gene and a second truncated cDNA
characterized by a 128-bp deletion between nucleotide positions 522 and
651. The deletion causes a frameshift in the open reading frame, thus
generating new coding sequence for a further 75 amino acids. The
truncated cDNA arises from alternative splicing that uses a cryptic
3-prime splice site in exon 2. Translation products of approximately 45
to 50 and 42 kD were immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells transfected
with wildtype and truncated GNRHR cDNAs, respectively. The splice
variant was incapable of ligand binding and signal transduction.
Coexpression of wildtype and truncated proteins in transiently or stably
transfected cells, resulted in impaired signaling via the wildtype GNRHR
by reducing maximal agonist-induced inositol phosphate accumulation.
This inhibitory effect depended on the amount of splice variant cDNA
cotransfected and was specific for GNRHR. Coexpression of the wildtype
and truncated GNRHRs resulted in impaired insertion of wildtype GNRHR
into the plasma membrane.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using cDNA probes derived from a human pituitary cDNA library, Fan et
al. (1994) screened a human genomic library and isolated 7 positive
clones. The clones contained the entire protein coding region of the
GNRHR gene, which is distributed among 3 exons and spans over 18.9 kb.
The 2 introns, measuring 4.2 and 5.0 kb, were located within the open
reading frame, indicating that the GNRHR gene is a member of the
intron-containing class of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily.
Genomic Southern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of a single
copy of the gene in the human genome.

Fan et al. (1995) showed that the GNRHR mRNA is approximately 5 kb long,
of which 987 bp comprise the coding region. The gene appears to have
large 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions, including, respectively,
multiple transcription initiation sites and polyadenylation signals.

MAPPING

Kaiser et al. (1994) used mapping panels of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids containing different human chromosomes or different regions of
human chromosome 4 to localize the GNRHR gene to 4q13.1-q21.1.
Furthermore, using linkage analysis of single-strand conformation
polymorphisms, they localized the murine homolog to mouse chromosome 5.
Using PCR analysis of DNA from human/hamster somatic hybrid cell lines,
Fan et al. (1994) assigned the GNRHR gene to chromosome 4. By in situ
hybridization using a biotinylated cDNA probe, Morrison et al. (1994)
localized the GNRHR gene to 4q13.2-q13.3. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization using a larger genomic clone as a probe, Leung et al.
(1995) apparently achieved a more precise localization of the GNRHR gene
to 4q21.2.

Kottler et al. (1995) isolated YAC clones containing the GNRHR gene.
Genetic analysis of the YACs showed that the gene lies between D4S409
and D4S392, which are located 76 and 77 cM, respectively, from the end
of the short arm of chromosome 4. Furthermore, by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Kottler et al. (1995) demonstrated colocalization of
GNRHR with the KIT gene (164920), which has been mapped to 4q12. Kakar
and Neill (1995) mapped the gene to 4q13 by PCR analysis of genomic DNA
from human/hamster somatic cell hybrids combined with fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

The growth of sex hormone-dependent tumors is inhibited by analogs of
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH; 152760). The use of LHRH
agonists for treatment of prostatic and breast cancer is based on
suppression of pituitary-gonadal function and the consequent creation of
a state of sex-steroid deficiency. In addition, LHRH agonists and
antagonists exert a direct effect on these tumors that probably is
mediated by specific high-affinity LHRH receptors found on these cells.
LHRH agonists and antagonists also suppress the growth of experimental
pancreatic cancers. Szende et al. (1991) demonstrated that pancreatic
tumor cells exhibit high-affinity binding sites for LHRH, but only in
their nuclei; low-affinity sites are associated with the cell membranes.
These binding sites appear to be LHRH receptors since electron
microscopic immunohistochemical studies show that an antibody to the
LHRH receptor reacted with sites in the nucleus of pancreatic tumor
cells.

Maji et al. (2009) found that peptide and protein hormones, including
GNRH, in secretory granules of the endocrine system are stored in an
amyloid-like cross-beta-sheet-rich conformation, and concluded that
functional amyloids in the pituitary and other organs can contribute to
normal cell and tissue physiology.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family in which a brother and sister had idiopathic
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110), de Roux et al. (1997)
demonstrated that the affected individuals were compound heterozygous
for mutations of the GNRHR gene (see 138850.0001). Layman et al. (1998)
also demonstrated compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in
the GNRHR gene in each of 4 affected sibs of a family (see 138850.0003).

Caron et al. (1999) studied a kindred with 3 sibs with isolated
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism who were genetic compounds for the
arg262-to-gln mutation (138850.0002) and an ala129-to-asp (138850.0004)
mutation that resulted in a complete loss of function. The 2 brothers
had microphallus and bilateral cryptorchidism and were referred for lack
of puberty; their sister had primary amenorrhea and a complete lack of
puberty. The authors concluded that these hypogonadal patients were
partially resistant to pulsatile GNRH administration, suggesting that
they should be treated with gonadotropins to induce spermatogenesis or
ovulation rather than with pulsatile GNRH. Kottler et al. (1999)
analyzed in detail the GNRHR mutations in 7 independent familial and
sporadic cases of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism reported to
that time. The Q106R (138850.0001) and R262Q (138850.0002) mutations
were frequent in patients from all geographic areas (North or South
America or Europe).

To determine the frequency and distribution of GNRHR mutations in a
heterogeneous population of patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism, Beranova et al. (2001) screened 108 probands with
idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism for mutations in the coding
sequence of GNRHR. Forty-eight of the 108 patients had a normal sense of
smell, whereas the remaining 60 had anosmia or hyposmia (Kallmann
syndrome). Five unrelated probands (3 men and 2 women), all normosmic,
were documented to have changes in the coding sequence of the GNRHR. Two
of these probands were from a subgroup of 5 kindreds consistent with a
recessive mode of inheritance, establishing a GNRHR mutation frequency
of 2 of 5 (40%) in patients with normosmic, autosomal recessive
idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The remaining 3 probands with
GNRHR mutations were from a subgroup of 18 patients without evidence of
familial involvement, indicating a prevalence of 3 of 18 (16.7%) in
patients with sporadic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and a
normal sense of smell. Among the 5 individuals bearing GNRHR mutations,
a broad spectrum of phenotypes was noted, including testicular sizes
that varied from prepubertal to the normal adult male range. Three
probands had compound heterozygous mutations, and 2 had homozygous
mutations. Of the 8 DNA sequence changes identified, 4 were novel. COS-7
cells transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding the human GNRHR
containing each of these 4 novel mutations failed to respond to GNRH
agonist stimulation.

Janovick et al. (2002) showed pharmacologic rescue, assessed by ligand
binding and restoration of receptor coupling to effector, of 5 naturally
occurring GNRHR mutants identified from patients with hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism, as well as rescue of other defective receptors
manufactured with internal or terminal deletions or substitutions at
sites expected to be involved in establishment of tertiary receptor
structure. The pharmacologic agent used was a small, membrane-permeant
molecule, originally designed as an orally active, nonpeptide receptor
antagonist, but is believed to function as a folding template, capable
of correcting the structural defects caused by the mutations and thereby
restoring function. The rescued receptor, stabilized in the plasma
membrane, coupled ligand binding to activation of the appropriate
effector system. For comparison, low-, intermediate-, or high-affinity
peptide antagonists of GNRHR (that do not penetrate the cell) were
unable to effect rescue, as was a nonbinding peptidomimetic congener of
the rescue agent; this latter effect demonstrates specificity of the
rescue agent. Janovick et al. (2002) concluded that mutant GNRHRs
frequently have not lost intrinsic functionality and are subject to
rescue by techniques that enhance membrane expression.

Bedecarrats et al. (2003) analyzed 2 common mutations in GNRHR, gln106
to arg (Q106R; 138850.0001) and arg262 to gln (R262Q; 138850.0002), for
their effects on the stimulation of gonadotropin subunit and GNRHR gene
expression by GNRH. Despite similar impairment of GNRH-stimulated
inositol phosphate production, dose-response analyses indicated that
Q106R and R262Q both reduced the sensitivity of the FSH-beta (136530)
gene promoter to a greater extent than LH-beta (152780) or the
alpha-glycoprotein subunit (alpha-GSU; 118850), suggesting the
involvement of more than one signaling pathway. Furthermore, although
the sensitivities of the LH-beta and FSH-beta gene promoters to GNRH
were similarly affected by both mutants, alpha-GSU sensitivity was
decreased to a greater extent by R262Q than by Q106R. Similarly, GNRHR
gene promoter sensitivity was significantly reduced only by R262Q. The
authors concluded that differential stimulation of LH-beta, FSH-beta,
and alpha-GSU gene expression may contribute to the varied phenotypes
observed among patients harboring these mutations.

Leanos-Miranda et al. (2003) demonstrated that GNRHR mutants inhibited
the function of wildtype GNRHR, measured by activation of effector and
ligand binding. Inhibition varied depending on the particular GNRHR
mutant coexpressed and the ratio of GNRHR mutant to wildtype GNRHR cDNA
cotransfected. The GNRHR mutants did not interfere with the function of
genetically modified GNRHRs bearing either a deletion of
primate-specific lys191 or the carboxyl-terminal tail of catfish GNRHR.
The dominant-negative effect of the naturally occurring receptor mutants
occurred only for the wildtype GNRHR, which has intrinsic low maturation
efficiency. The data suggested that this dominant-negative effect
accompanies the diminished plasma membrane expression as a recent
evolutionary event.

To determine whether genetic variation within either the GNRHR or GNRH1
genes contributes to the regulation of pubertal timing in the general
population, Sedlmeyer et al. (2005) performed sequence analysis and
haplotype-based association studies in individuals with later than
average pubertal development. All observed associations were relatively
modest and only nominally statistically significant. The authors
concluded that genetic variation in GHRH1 and GNRHR is not likely to be
a substantial modulator of pubertal timing in the general population.

In 2 sisters with primary amenorrhea and no breast development at 25 and
18 years of age, respectively (146110), Seminara et al. (2000)
identified compound heterozygosity for Q106R on one allele and R262Q
(138850.0002) on the other. The apparently unaffected parents were
heterozygous for the mutations. Pitteloud et al. (2007) reexamined the
family studied by Seminara et al. (2000) and identified heterozygosity
for an additional missense mutation in the FGFR1 gene (136350.0016) in
the 2 sisters and in their father, who had a history of delayed puberty.
Mutation analysis of the children of the younger sister revealed that
her unaffected daughter, who had undergone normal puberty, was
heterozygous for the mutation in FGFR1 but had no mutations in the GNRHR
gene, and that her prepubertal 10-year-old twin sons, born without
cryptorchidism or microphallus, were each heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations in GNRHR but did not have any mutations in the FGFR1 gene.
Pitteloud et al. (2007) concluded that defects in 2 different genes can
synergize to produce a more severe phenotype in families with
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism than either alone, and that this digenic
model may account for some of the phenotypic heterogeneity seen in GnRH
deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
FERTILE EUNUCH SYNDROME, INCLUDED
GNRHR, GLN106ARG

In a sibship in which a brother and sister had hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH7; 146110), de Roux et al. (1997) found that the
affected persons were compound heterozygotes for a gln106-to-arg (Q106R)
mutation and an arg262-to-gln (R262Q) mutation (138850.0002) in the GNRH
receptor. The propositus was a 22-year-old man who was referred because
of hypogonadism. Puberty had occurred at the age of 16. His height was
180 cm and his arm span 186 cm. He reported impaired libido. Physical
examination revealed absence of facial hair, sparse pubic hair (Tanner
stage 3), and a penis of 6 cm. He had scrotal testes, and the volume of
each was 8 ml (normal, 15 to 25 ml). There was no gynecomastia. He had a
normal sense of smell and no mirror movements of the upper limbs, no
abnormal eye movements, no colorblindness, and no renal or craniofacial
abnormalities. The karyotype was 46,XY. The patient's older sister was a
37-year-old woman with a history of primary amenorrhea and infertility.
Spontaneous thelarche had occurred at the age of 14 years. She had a
single episode of uterine bleeding at the age of 18, and afterward
received combined oral contraceptive treatment. This treatment was
interrupted when she desired children. However, amenorrhea and absence
of pregnancy led to ovulation-inducing treatment, which resulted in 2
normal pregnancies and the births of a girl and a boy, 4 and 7 years old
at the time of report. After each pregnancy, she had persistent
amenorrhea, and oral contraceptive treatment was resumed. Her height was
165 cm. Pubic hair development was at Tanner stage 5, and her breasts
and external genitalia were those of a normal woman. Both parents and a
sister who was found to be heterozygous for 1 of the 2 mutations were
clinically and endocrinologically normal. A G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 317 was responsible for the gln106-to-arg mutation in the
first extracellular loop of the receptor.

De Roux et al. (1999) found this mutation in compound heterozygosity
with S217R (138850.0005) on the same allele and R262Q (138850.0002) on
the other allele.

In 2 sisters with primary amenorrhea and no breast development at 25 and
18 years of age, respectively, Seminara et al. (2000) identified
compound heterozygosity for Q106R on one allele and R262Q (138850.0002)
on the other. The apparently unaffected parents were heterozygous for
the mutations. Pitteloud et al. (2007) reexamined this family and
identified heterozygosity for an additional missense mutation in the
FGFR1 gene (136350.0016) in the 2 sisters and in their father, who had a
history of delayed puberty. Mutation analysis of the children of the
younger sister revealed that her unaffected daughter, who underwent
normal puberty, was heterozygous for the mutation in FGFR1 but had no
mutations in the GNRHR gene, and that her prepubertal 10-year-old twin
sons, born without cryptorchidism or microphallus, were each
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations in the GNRHR gene but did not have
any mutations in the FGFR1 gene. Pitteloud et al. (2007) concluded that
defects in 2 different genes can synergize to produce a more severe
phenotype in families with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism than either
alone, and that this digenic model may account for some of the
phenotypic heterogeneity seen in GnRH deficiency.

Pitteloud et al. (2001) described a 26-year-old male with a mild
phenotypic form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the fertile eunuch
syndrome (228300) (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in the presence of
normal testicular size and some degree of spermatogenesis), associated
with a homozygous gln106-to-arg GNRHR mutation. De Roux et al. (1997)
had shown that this mutation, located in the first extracellular loop of
the GNRHR, decreases but does not eliminate GNRH binding. The proband
had hypogonadal testosterone levels, detectable but apulsatile
gonadotropin secretion, and a normal adult male testicular size of 17 mL
at baseline. After only 4 months of treatment with CG (see 118860)
alone, he developed sperm in his ejaculate and his wife conceived.
Following cessation of CG therapy, the patient demonstrated reversal of
his hypogonadotropism as evidenced by normal adult male testosterone
levels and the appearance of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (see 152780)
secretion. The authors concluded that this case expands the clinical
spectrum of GNRHR mutations, provides the first genetic basis for the
fertile eunuch variant of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and documents
the occurrence of reversible hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in a patient
with a GNRHR mutation.

Costa et al. (2001) found this mutation in compound heterozygosity with
asn10 to lys (138850.0009). In vitro analysis indicated that the Q106R
mutation, located in the first extracellular loop, was able to bind
GNRH, but with a reduced affinity.

.0002
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ARG262GLN

See 138850.0001 and de Roux et al. (1997). A G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 785 yielded the arg262-to-gln (R262Q) mutation in the third
intracellular loop of the GNRH receptor. Caron et al. (1999) detected
the R262Q mutation in compound heterozygosity with an A129D mutation
(138850.0004) in 3 sibs.

De Roux et al. (1999) found this mutation in compound heterozygosity
with Q106R (138850.0001) and S217R (138850.0005) on the other allele.

See 138850.0001 and Seminara et al. (2000).

Lin et al. (2006) reported a homozygous R262Q mutation in the GNRH
receptor in 2 brothers with IHH (HH7; 146110). The proband presented at
15 years of age with delayed puberty. After a short course of
testosterone, he seemed to be progressing through puberty appropriately
and was discharged from follow-up. His younger brother was also referred
with delayed puberty but showed little progress after treatment. Lin et
al. (2006) concluded that homozygous partial loss-of-function mutations
in the GNRHR such as R262Q can present with variable phenotypes,
including apparent delayed puberty.

.0003
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, TYR284CYS

In a screening of 46 unrelated patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (32 males at least 18 years of age and 14 females at least
17 years of age) without anosmia (HH7; 146110), using denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis of GC-clamped PCR products, Layman et al.
(1998) found 2 missense mutations in affected members of 1 family. One
was a CGG-to-CAG (arg262 to gln; R262Q) mutation in intracellular loop 3
(138850.0002); the other was a TAT-to-TGT (tyr284 to cys; Y284C)
mutation in transmembrane region 6. All 4 affected sibs were compound
heterozygotes for these mutations, whereas an unaffected sib and all 75
unrelated controls were normal. At least 1 of the affected females
ovulated with exogenous gonadotropins. The 2 GNRHR mutations had minimal
effects upon receptor affinity, but receptor expression was decreased
for both.

.0004
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ALA129ASP

Caron et al. (1999) found that 3 sibs with isolated hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) were compound heterozygotes for mutations in
the GNRHR gene. One mutation was a change of amino acid 129 from alanine
to aspartic acid (A129D), and the other was a replacement of arginine by
glutamine at amino acid 262 (R262Q; 138850.0002). The A129D change was
caused by a C-to-A transversion at nucleotide position 386. The father
was heterozygous for the R262Q mutation, the mother for the A129D
mutation.

.0005
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITH ANOSMIA
GNRHR, SER217ARG

De Roux et al. (1999) performed detailed endocrinologic studies in 3
affected members of a family with IHH (HH7; 146110) who had GNRHR
mutations. All 3 were compound heterozygotes for an arg262-to-gln
(R262Q; 138850.0002) substitution on one allele and gln106-to-arg
(Q106R; 138850.0001) and ser217-to-arg (S217R) substitutions on the
other. When expressed in heterologous cells, both the Q106R and S217R
mutations altered hormone binding, whereas the R262Q mutation altered
activation of phospholipase C (see 600810). The proband, a 30-year-old
male, had complete hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (146110) with extremely
low plasma levels of gonadotropins, absence of pulsatility of endogenous
LH and alpha subunit (see 152780), absence of response to GNRH (152760)
and GNRH agonist (triptorelin), and absence of effect of pulsatile
administration of GNRH. His affected 18- and 24-year-old sisters had
only partial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. They both had primary
amenorrhea and normal breast development, but the younger sister had
retarded bone maturation and uterus development. Gonadotropin
concentrations were normal or low, but in both cases were restored to
normal levels by a single injection of GNRH. In both sisters, there were
no spontaneous pulses of LH, but pulsatile administration of GNRH
provoked pulsatile secretion of LH in the younger one. The authors
concluded that the same GNRHR mutations may exhibit varying degrees of
alteration of gonadotropin function in affected members of the same
family.

.0006
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, SER168ARG

Pralong et al. (1999) described a male patient with complete
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) who presented primary
failure of pulsatile GNRH (152760) therapy, but responded to exogenous
gonadotropin administration. The patient had a T-to-A transversion at
codon 168 of the gene encoding the GNRH receptor (GNRHR), resulting in a
ser168-to-arg (S168R) change in the fourth transmembrane domain of
GNRHR. This mutation was present in homozygous state in the patient,
whereas it was in heterozygous state in both phenotypically normal
parents. When introduced into GNRHR cDNA, S168R resulted in complete
loss of the receptor-mediated signaling response to GNRH.

.0007
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, LEU314TER

Kottler et al. (2000) described a woman with complete hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) and a new compound heterozygous mutation of
the GNRHR gene. A null mutation L314X leading to a partial deletion of
the seventh transmembrane domain of GNRHR was associated with the Q106R
mutation (138850.0001). The L314X mutant receptor showed neither
measurable binding nor inositol phosphate production when transfected in
CHO-K1 cells compared to the wildtype receptor. The disease was
transmitted by an autosomal recessive mode, and heterozygous individuals
with GNRHR mutations had normal pubertal development and fertility.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ARG139HIS

Costa et al. (2001) investigated 17 Brazilian patients (10 males and 7
females) from 14 different families with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
and normal olfaction (HH7; 146110). The diagnosis of hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism was based on absent or incomplete sexual development after
17 years of age associated with low or normal levels of LH (152780) in
both sexes and low levels of testosterone in males and of estradiol in
females. All patients presented with a normal sense of smell in an
olfactory-specific test. In 1 female with complete hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism, Costa et al. (2001) identified an arg139-to-his mutation
(R139H), located in the conserved DRS motif at the junction of the third
transmembrane and the second intracellular loop of the GNRHR, in the
homozygous state. The R139H mutation completely eliminated detectable
GNRH-binding activity and prevented GNRH-induced stimulation of inositol
phosphate accumulation in vitro. The patient had undetectable serum
basal LH and FSH levels that failed to respond to GNRH stimulation.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ASN10LYS

In 4 sibs (2 males and 2 females) with partial hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH7; 146110), Costa et al. (2001) identified a novel
compound heterozygous mutation, asn10-to-lys (N10K) and gln106-to-arg
(Q106R; 138850.0001). The Q106R mutation binds GNRH with a reduced
affinity; the N10K mutation, in the extracellular amino-terminal domain
of the receptor, also reduces the affinity for GNRH in vitro. Affected
patients with the N10K/Q106R mutations had partial hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism with low serum basal LH levels that were responsive to GNRH
stimulation.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, GLU90LYS

In 2 sibs with the complete form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7;
146110), Soderlund et al. (2001) detected a novel homozygous G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 268 of the GNRHR gene, which resulted in a
glu90-to-lys (E90K) amino acid substitution. This mutation is located in
the second transmembrane domain of the GNRH receptor. To assess the
functional role of E90, Maya-Nunez et al. (2002) performed mutation
analysis of the E90K substitution. Transient expression of the mutant
receptor in COS-7 cells resulted in a virtual abolition of GNRH agonist
binding and agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover, initially
suggesting that E90 may be essential for GNRH binding. To examine the
role of a site known to suppress GNRHR function, mutants with deletion
of K191 from the GNRHR and/or addition of catfish Gnrhr intracellular
C-terminal tail to GNRHR were prepared. Activation of intracellular
signaling in response to buserelin was restored by deletion of K191 from
the E90K mutant receptor but minimally by addition of the catfish GNRHR
C-terminal tail. This study provided evidence that the E90K mutation
impairs GNRHR-effector coupling. Maya-Nunez et al. (2002) concluded that
the observation that sequence modifications that enhance surface
expression of the receptor restore function presents the possibility
that loss of surface expression may underlie the severe phenotype
exhibited by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism patients bearing this
mutation.

.0011
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, IVS1, G-A, -1

Silveira et al. (2002) reported a woman with complete GNRH resistance
(HH7; 146110) secondary to a novel homozygous GNRHR gene mutation,
transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. She presented with primary
amenorrhea and absent thelarche and pubarche. Dynamic tests demonstrated
absent spontaneous gonadotropin pulsatility, and no response to either
exogenous pulsatile or acute GNRH administration. However, she responded
to exogenous gonadotropin administration with a resulting normal
pregnancy. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed a homozygous splice junction
mutation, a G-to-A transition at the intron 1-exon 2 boundary. Her
unaffected sister was heterozygous for this mutation. Results of RT-PCR
analysis of RNA showed a transcript lacking all of exon 2, with splicing
of exon 1 to exon 3. This created a frameshift, generating a coding
sequence for 3 new amino acids followed by a stop codon. Although it is
not clear whether the mutant receptor was actually expressed, the
resultant mRNA sequence was presumed to produce a truncated receptor
with no binding or signaling capacity.

.0012
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ALA171THR

In 2 brothers with severe hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110),
Karges et al. (2003) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 511 of the
LHCGR gene that resulted in an ala171-to-thr (A171T) substitution at
transmembrane helix 4 (TMH4). After in vitro expression in human
embryonic kidney 293T cells, the A171T mutant LHCGR exhibited a lack of
phospholipase C activity in signal transduction. Specific receptor
binding of radioisotope-labeled GNRH ligand was undetectable in
transfected cells. Molecular modeling and dynamic simulation of the
mutant receptor suggested the introduction of a stable hydrogen bond
that impeded conformational mobility of the TMH3 and TMH4 domains
required for sequential ligand binding and receptor activation, thus
stabilizing the LHCGR in its inactive conformation.

.0013
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, ASN10LYS AND GLN11LYS

Meysing et al. (2004) reported a normosmic female subject with
congenital idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) in
whom treatment with pulsatile GNRH resulted in an unusual response. The
subject not only required an increased dose of pulsatile GNRH for
ovarian follicular development, but LH secretion did not increase
appropriately, estradiol levels remained low, and she did not ovulate
spontaneously. Sequencing of the GNRHR coding sequence revealed compound
heterozygosity for a 30T-A transversion in exon 1 of the GNRHR gene,
resulting in a 2-amino acid substitution on one allele (N10K+Q11K), and
a missense mutation on the other allele (P320L; 138850.0014).
Introduction of the P320L mutation into the GNRH receptor led to failure
of detectable ligand binding and failure of stimulation of inositol
phosphate production and gonadotropin subunit gene promoter activity in
response to GnRH in transiently transfected cells. Introduction of the
N10K+Q11K mutation into the GNRH receptor resulted in reduced binding of
a GNRH agonist to 25% of the wildtype receptor. In addition, the EC50
value for GNRH stimulation of inositol phosphate production was
significantly increased, and the dose-response curves for stimulation of
alpha-gonadotropin subunit (118850), LH-beta (152780), and FSH-beta
(136530) gene transcription by GNRH were similarly shifted to the right.
The authors proposed that these GNRHR mutations result in a rightward
shift of the dose-response curves of gonadotropin responses to pulsatile
GNRH in the subject and unmask the differential sensitivities of LH and
FSH to GNRH, resulting in low LH and estradiol levels despite
appropriate FSH secretion and follicular growth.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 7 WITHOUT ANOSMIA
GNRHR, PRO320LEU

The patient with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH7; 146110) reported by
Meysing et al. (2004) was a compound heterozygote for a 2-amino acid
substitution on one allele of the GNRHR gene (138850.0013) and a 959C-T
transition in exon 3 on the other that resulted in a pro320-to-leu
substitution (P320L).

;;CALCIUM CHANNEL, L TYPE, ALPHA-1 POLYPEPTIDE, ISOFORM 5; CACNL1A5;;
CaV2.2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels are multisubunit complexes found in
the membrane of many excitable cells that regulate calcium entry (see
601011). N-type calcium channels, which control neurotransmitter release
from neurons, are dihydropyridine-insensitive and
omega-conotoxin-sensitive. The alpha-1 subunit forms the pore through
which calcium enters the cell, and is encoded by a family of at least 5
genes.

CLONING

Williams et al. (1992) cloned the neuronal alpha-1B subunit by probing
brain cDNA libraries with a rabbit probe. RT-PCR revealed 2
alternatively spliced isoforms, encoding predicted products of 2,339
(alpha-1B-1) and 2,237 (alpha-1B-2) amino acids, with 64% and 73%
identity to the rabbit gene product, respectively. Both isoforms are
transcribed only in central nervous system tissue.

MAPPING

Diriong et al. (1995) and Kim et al. (1997) mapped the CACNA1B gene to
chromosome 9q34 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Williams et al. (1992) used transient expression studies in HEK293 cells
to demonstrate that CACNA1B had N-type calcium channel activity.

Using binding and immunoprecipitation assays on adult rat cortical
tissue, Maeno-Hikichi et al. (2003) showed that the enigma-like LIM
domain protein (ENH; 605904) interacts specifically with protein kinase
C-epsilon (PRKCE; 176975) and the C terminus of CACNA1B to form a
macromolecular complex. Functional studies in Xenopus oocytes indicated
that expression of ENH resulted in increased rapid and specific
modulation of N-type calcium channels by PKCE. The authors concluded
that through interactions with a common adaptor protein, the formation
of a kinase-substrate complex is the molecular basis for the specificity
and efficiency of cellular signaling.

The CaV2.2 calcium channel interacts with and is modulated by CRMP2
(602463). Overexpression of CRMP2 leads to increased surface expression
of CaV2.2 on neurons, enhanced calcium currents, and an increase in
stimulated release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide
(CGRP; 114130) from dorsal root ganglia (summary by Brittain et al.,
2011).

ANIMAL MODEL

Kim et al. (2001) found that CaV2.2-null mice were viable and fertile
and showed normal motor coordination. CaV2.2-null mice exhibited reduced
responses to certain pain stimuli, suggesting that CaV2.2 plays a role
in pain perception at the spinal level, but not at the supraspinal
level.

Kim et al. (2009) observed elevated aggression in CaV2.2-null mice.
CaV2.2 is highly expressed in the dorsal raphe nucleus of adult rats,
and injection of an N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker into the dorsal raphe
nucleus of wildtype mice resulted in increased aggressive behavior. Kim
et al. (2009) concluded that N-type Ca(2+) channels in the dorsal raphe
nucleus have a role in the control of aggression.

In rats, Brittain et al. (2011) demonstrated that inflammatory and
neuropathic hypersensitivity can be suppressed by a synthetic 15-mer
peptide (CBD3) that uncouples Crmp2 and CaV2.2 calcium channels in
neurons. Studies in cultured neurons and spinal cord slices showed that
CBD3 peptide bound CaV2.2, interfered with the interaction of Crmp2 and
CaV2.2, and reduced channel function, as evidenced by decreased CGRP
neuropeptide release from sensory neurons and decreased excitatory
synaptic transmission in dorsal horn neurons. In rats, treatment with
CBD3 also reduced meningeal blood flow and reduced nocifensive behavior
induced by peripheral formalin injection or corneal capsaicin
application, as well as reversed neuropathic hypersensitivity produced
by an antiretroviral drug. The peptide was mildly anxiolytic without
affecting memory retrieval, sensorimotor function or depression.

600025	TITLE *600025 KINESIN LIGHT CHAIN 1; KLC1
;;KINESIN 2; KNS2;;
KNS2A;;
KLC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Kinesins are tubulin (see 191130) molecular motors that transport
organelles within cells and move chromosomes along microtubules during
cell division. In sea urchin and mammalian cells, kinesins have been
characterized as tetrameric proteins containing 2 heavy (alpha) chains
of approximately 120 kD and 2 light (beta) chains of approximately 70
kD. The alpha chains provide the tubulin binding site and the ATPase
domains, whereas the beta chains are responsible for the specific
attachment of the organelle to be moved by the kinesin tetramer.
Kinesins transport their bound organelle to the plus end of the
microtubule (summary by Chernajovsky et al., 1996).

CLONING

Chernajovsky et al. (1996) noted that differential splicing occurs for
the kinesin beta (light chain) cDNA sequences at the 3-prime end of the
rat kinesin mRNA, producing kinesins having different C-terminal ends
that seem to confer the kinesin specificity for organelle binding.
Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (1993) isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding the
human kinesin light chain protein (KLC). The cDNA encodes a deduced
polypeptide of 569 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 64,789
Da. The predicted secondary internal structure of the KLC molecule
consists of about 27 contiguous repeats, each of approximately 21 amino
acids, and could be divided into 3 domains.

Rahman et al. (1998) cloned mouse Klc1. The deduced 581-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal coiled-coil region of about 100 amino acids
and 6 imperfect tetratricopeptide repeats of about 34 amino acids each.
Northern and Western blot analyses detected Klc1 predominantly in mouse
central and peripheral neuronal tissues. Immunofluorescence analysis of
cultured rat hippocampal precursor cells showed that Klc1 levels
increased with differentiation. In situ hybridization of mouse brain
showed that both Klc1 and Klc2 (611729) were enriched in olfactory bulb,
hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and the granular layer of cerebellum. Klc1
was expressed in a subset of cells in the sciatic nerve and showed
diffuse axonal staining. Fractionation of whole mouse brain extracts
revealed Klc1 and Klc2 in the cytosolic fraction and Klc2 in the
microsomal fraction.

GENE FUNCTION

Chernajovsky et al. (1996) characterized the human KNS2 gene product of
a differentially spliced, T-cell-derived mRNA and cloned its promoter
region. The promoter region transcribes constitutively. In permanently
transfected human HeLa and NB100 neuroblastoma cells, a reporter gene
containing the promoter and part of the first exon of beta kinesin was
75-fold more active than the HSV-tk promoter. The first exon contains a
5-prime untranslated sequence capable of forming a stable double-hairpin
loop, which functions as a translational enhancer. Its deletion
decreases the efficiency of in vitro translation of beta kinesin mRNA.

Kamal et al. (2000) demonstrated that the axonal transport of APP
(104760) in neurons is mediated by the direct binding of APP to the
light chain subunit of kinesin-1.

Using anti-mouse Klc1 antibodies to immunoprecipitate proteins from
mouse brain lysates, Rahman et al. (1998) showed that Klc1 associated
with Nkhc (KIF5A; 602821) and Ukhc (KIF5B; 602809), but not with Klc2.
In the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, both Klc1 and Klc2
cosedimented with taxol-stabilized mouse brain microtubules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chernajovsky et al. (1996) determined that the entire KNS2 gene spans 90
kb and encodes a 70-kD protein.

MAPPING

Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (1993) assigned the KLC gene to chromosome 14 by
screening of a human/hamster somatic cell hybrid panel. Goedert et al.
(1996) mapped the KNS2 gene to 14q32.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

600301	TITLE *600301 ACYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE, SHORT/BRANCHED CHAIN; ACADSB
;;SBCAD;;
2-@METHYLBUTYRYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) are a group of mitochondrial enzymes
involved in the metabolism of fatty acids or branched-chain amino acids
(Rozen et al., 1994).

CLONING

Rozen et al. (1994) isolated and characterized a cDNA encoding the
precursor for a novel member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene family.
The open reading frame of 1.3 kb encoded a precursor protein of 431
amino acids, which is processed in vitro to yield a mature protein of
399 amino acids. The cDNA had significant sequence similarity to other
members of the family, with the greatest homology (38%) to short-chain
acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (606885). The cDNA was expressed in eukaryotic
(COS) and prokaryotic (E. coli) cells, producing a protein of the
expected size with unique substrate specificities. The gene product had
the greatest activity toward the short/branched chain acyl-CoA
derivative, (S)-2-methylbutyryl-CoA, but also reacted significantly with
other 2-methyl-branched chain substrates and with short/straight chain
acyl-CoA. Because of the substrate specificity, they proposed the
designation short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Andresen et al. (2000) determined that the ACADSB gene contains 11
exons.

MAPPING

Arden et al. (1995) assigned the ACADSB gene to chromosome 10 by
hybridization to human/rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs and localized the
gene to 10q25-q26 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with isolated 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency
(610006), Andresen et al. (2000) identified a homozygous mutation in the
ACADSB gene (600301.0001), resulting in a 100-bp deletion. Enzyme assay
of the patient's fibroblasts, using 2-methylbutyryl-CoA as substrate,
confirmed the defect. Sequence analysis of candidate acyl-CoA
dehydrogenases revealed heterozygosity for the common short-chain ACAD
A625 variant allele and no mutations in ACAD8 (604773). The study showed
that ACAD8 is an isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and that both wildtype
ACAD8 and ACADSB proteins are imported into mitochondria and form
tetramers.

In patients with isolated 2-methylbutyryl glycinuria due to ACADSB
deficiency, Gibson et al. (2000) and Madsen et al. (2006) identified
mutations in the ACADSB gene (600301.0002; 600301.0003).

Sass et al. (2008) reported 6 patients, including 2 sets of sibs, with
2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency confirmed by genetic
analysis (T148I, 600301.0004 and E387K, 600301.0005). The patients were
of Turkish or Lebanese Arab origin. None of the patients had clinical
symptoms, and the 3 probands were all ascertained by newborn screening.
For the 3 probands, development was normal at age 3, 6, and 6 years,
respectively, even without treatment. In vitro studies of patient
fibroblasts confirmed an impairment in isoleucine degradation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
2-@METHYLBUTYRYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
ACADSB, 1228G-A, EX10DEL

Andresen et al. (2000) identified homozygosity for a 1228G-A mutation in
the ACADSB gene, causing skipping of exon 10, in a patient with
methylbutyryl glycinuria (610006). The patient was a 3-year-old boy, the
son of first-cousin parents from Pakistan. During his second year of
life he became increasingly floppy, with retarded motor development,
generalized muscular atrophy, and strabismus. At age 3 years he was able
to walk with support. Although both parents and 2 sibs were
asymptomatic, the mother was shown also to excrete 2-methylbutyryl
glycine.

.0002
2-@METHYLBUTYRYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
ACADSB, LEU222PHE

In a male infant born of a northern European mother and Eritrean father,
Gibson et al. (2000) observed an isolated increase in 2-methylbutyryl
glycine and 2-methylbutyryl carnitine in blood and urine (610006). An
isolated block in 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase was demonstrated in
cultured fibroblasts. The DNA sequence of ACADSB contained a
heterozygous 768C-T substitution causing a leu222-to-phe (L222F) change
in the protein. Although pregnancy and birth were normal, the infant was
readmitted at age 3 days for poor feeding, lethargy, hypothermia,
hypoglycemia, and episodes of apnea. EEG and MRI of the brain showed
changes. A female fetus in a subsequent pregnancy was found to be
affected.

Madsen et al. (2006) found that the 2 sibs reported by Gibson et al.
(2000) were compound heterozygous for the L222F mutation and a splice
site mutation (600301.0003). Madsen et al. (2006) reported that the
L222F substitution resulted from a 763C-T transition.

.0003
2-@METHYLBUTYRYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
ACADSB, IVS3DS, A-G, +3

In a boy with 2-methylbutyryl glycinuria (610006), whose parents were
from Somalia, Madsen et al. (2006) identified a homozygous A-to-G
transition in intron 3 of the ACADSB gene, resulting in the skipping of
exon 3 as confirmed by mRNA analysis. The resultant mRNA likely leads to
nonsense-mediated decay, but any residual protein was predicted to lack
vital enzyme activity. Madsen et al. (2006) also identified the splice
site mutation in 2 affected sibs previously reported by Gibson et al.
(2000); see 600301.0002.

.0004
2-@METHYLBUTYRYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
ACADSB, THR148ILE

In 2 brothers, born of a consanguineous Arab couple from Lebanon, with
2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (610006), Sass et al.
(2008) identified compound heterozygosity for mutation in the ACADSB
gene: a 443C-T transition in exon 4, resulting in a thr148-to-ile
(T148I) substitution, and the E387K mutation (600301.0005). One was
diagnosed via newborn screening, and the other was diagnosed at age 3
years after his brother's diagnosis. Neither patient showed any clinical
abnormalities, and both had normal development, but were lost to
follow-up when the proband was 10 months old. The authors also
identified homozygosity for the T148I mutation in 2 sibs from a
consanguineous Turkish family. Both boys had normal development at age 6
and 7 years, respectively. In vitro studies of patient fibroblasts
confirmed an impairment in isoleucine degradation.

.0005
2-@METHYLBUTYRYL-CoA DEHYDROGENASE DEFICIENCY
ACADSB, GLU387LYS

In a Turkish girl with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency
(610006), Sass et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 1159G-A transition
in exon 10 of the ACADSB gene, resulting in a glu387-to-lys (E387K)
substitution. She showed normal development at age 3 years. The E387K
mutation was found in 2 of 146 Turkish control chromosomes and in 2 of
96 Lebanese control chromosomes, yielding an allelic frequency of about
2% in these populations. In vitro studies of patient fibroblasts
confirmed an impairment in isoleucine degradation.

608937	TITLE *608937 SH2B ADAPTOR PROTEIN 1; SH2B1
;;SH2B, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; SH2B;;
KIAA1299
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human fetal brain
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned SH2B, which they designated
KIAA1299. The 5-prime UTR contains several repetitive elements, and the
deduced protein contains 730 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate
to high expression in all fetal and adult tissues and specific brain
regions examined. Highest expression was detected in adult lung and
ovary.

Using N-terminally truncated murine Jak2 (147796) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a rat adipocyte cDNA library, Rui et al. (1997)
cloned a splice variant of Sh2b that they designated Sh2b-beta. The
deduced 670-amino acid protein contains an SH2 domain in its C-terminal
half. The rat Sh2b-alpha protein contains 757 amino acids and is
identical to Sh2b-beta through the SH2 domain, but the proteins have
different C termini.

Nelms et al. (1999) cloned a variant of mouse SH2b that they designated
Sh2b-gamma. The deduced 682-amino acid protein differs from Sh2b-alpha
and Sh2b-beta only in the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected
expression in all mouse tissues examined.

Yousaf et al. (2001) compared the 4 mouse Sh2b splice variants.
Differences arise by alternative splicing of the last exons (exons 7, 8,
and 9), resulting in frameshifts and unique C-terminal sequences after
the last common amino acid, gln631. The alpha, beta, gamma, and delta
isoforms contain 756, 670, 682, and 724 amino acids, respectively, and
have apparent molecular masses of about 90, 80, 80, and 85 kD,
respectively. All 4 variants have proline-rich and serine-rich regions,
as well as a PH domain, an SH2 domain, and numerous potential
phosphorylation target motifs. The unique C-terminal domains of the
alpha, gamma, and delta isoforms contain a proline-rich SH3
domain-interacting site. In addition, the delta isoform has 2 consensus
nuclear localization sequences and a third serine-tryptophan-rich
region. Homologs of all 4 mouse Sh2b isoforms are found in human, with
differences in the C terminus following gln631. RT-PCR detected at least
2 Sh2b variants in all mouse tissues examined. Expression of each
variant was tissue specific, and the variants were usually expressed in
pairs of alpha and delta or beta and gamma.

GENE FUNCTION

Rui et al. (1997) found that the C terminus of rat Sh2b-beta, which
contains the SH2 domain, specifically interacted with kinase-active,
tyrosyl-phosphorylated murine Jak2, but not with kinase-inactive,
unphosphorylated Jak2. In a mouse fibroblast cell line, growth hormone
(GH; 139250) stimulated the interaction of Sh3b-beta with
tyrosyl-phosphorylated Jak2 both in vitro and in vivo. GH promoted a
transient and dose-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of Sh2b-beta in the
mouse fibroblasts. Sh2b-beta was also tyrosyl phosphorylated in response
to gamma-interferon (147570), a cytokine that activates JAK2 and JAK1
(147795).

Kong et al. (2002) found that mouse Sh2b-beta interacted with Fgfr3
(134934) through its SH2 domain. SH2b-beta was tyrosine phosphorylated
when coexpressed with activated mutants of Fgfr3, and the extent of
Sh2b-beta phosphorylation correlated with the degree of receptor
activation. Overexpression of Sh2b-beta also increased the
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat5b (604260) by
activated Fgfr3.

Nelms et al. (1999) found that mouse Sh2b-gamma interacted specifically
with insulin receptor (147670). The interaction required phosphorylation
within the triple tyrosine motif of the receptor kinase domain.

Yousaf et al. (2001) found that all 4 Sh2b variants were phosphorylated
on tyrosine specifically in response to IGFI (147440) and PDGF (see
190040) stimulation of a mouse fibroblast cell line. Expression of the
cDNAs caused variant-dependent levels of IGFI- and PDGF-induced
mitogenesis. The most pronounced increase in mitogenesis was
consistently observed for the gamma variant, followed by delta, alpha,
and beta with decreasing responses. The mitogenic response to EGF
(131530) was unaffected.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nelms et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Sh2b gene contains 9
exons. The Sh2b-alpha, -beta, and -gamma splice variants are identical
through exon 6 and most of exon 7, which encodes the core of the SH2
domain. The use of alternate splice sites at the 3-prime end of exon 7
results in the different Sh2b variants.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the SH2B gene
to chromosome 16. By interspecific backcross analysis, Nelms et al.
(1999) mapped the mouse Sh2b gene to the distal arm of chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

SH2B1 is one of the genes disrupted in patients with the 220-kb deletion
of chromosome 16p11.2 (613444). The deletion syndrome is characterized
by obesity and developmental delay.

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
SH2B1 gene and obesity, see BMIQ16 (see 613444).

ANIMAL MODEL

Ohtsuka et al. (2002) generated Sh2b-null mice. Both male and female
Sh2b -/- mice showed slight retardation in growth and impaired
fertility. Female knockout mice possessed small, anovulatory ovaries
with reduced numbers of follicles, and male Sh2b -/- mice had small
testes with reduced sperm number. Sh2b -/- cumulus cells did not respond
to either follicle-stimulating hormone (see 136530) or IGF1.

Duan et al. (2004) demonstrated that systemic deletion of the mouse Sh2b
gene severely impaired insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, liver, and
fat. Sh2b -/- mice progressively developed hyperinsulinemia,
hyperglycemia, and glucose intolerance. Duan et al. (2004) concluded
that SH2B is a physiologic enhancer of insulin action and is required
for glucose homeostasis during aging.

Ren et al. (2007) generated Sh2b1-knockout mice that developed
hyperlipidemia, leptin (164160) resistance, hyperphagia, obesity,
hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance.
Neuron-specific restoration of Sh2b1 corrected the metabolic disorders
in the knockout mice and improved leptin signaling and leptin regulation
of orexigenic neuropeptide expression in the hypothalamus.
Neuron-specific overexpression of Sh2b1 dose-dependently protected
against high fat diet-induced leptin resistance and obesity. Ren et al.
(2007) suggested that neuronal SH2B1 regulates energy balance, body
weight, peripheral insulin sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis at least
in part by enhancing hypothalamic leptin sensitivity.

DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Seite et al. (1991) localized 1 member of the human zinc finger Kruppel
family, ZNF12 (KOX3), to chromosome 7p22-p21 by a combination of
analysis of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization.
Rousseau-Merck et al. (1993) described pulsed field gel electrophoresis
experiments indicating that ZNF12 and ZNF26 (194537) are within the same
DNA fragment less than 300 kb long.

HISTORY

The control of gene expression in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is
mediated, at least in part, by the binding of regulatory proteins to
specific DNA sequences. Many of these proteins share evolutionarily
conserved DNA binding domains, e.g. homeodomains (Gehring, 1987) or zinc
finger structures (Schuh et al., 1986). These homologies have been used
to clone individual genes of these multigene families from higher
eukaryotic organisms.

603762	TITLE *603762 PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; PRPSAP2
;;PAP41
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) is a primary substrate and a critical
control factor for de novo synthesis of purine and pyrimidine
nucleotides, histidine, tryptophan, and NAD. The enzyme PRPP synthetase
(PRPS), which catalyzes the formation of PRPP, exists in an aggregate
composed of 2 catalytic subunits, PRPS I (PRPS1; 311850) and PRPS II
(PRPS2; 311860), and 2 associated subunits, PAP39 (601249) and PAP41. By
searching an EST database for sequences related to PAP39, Katashima et
al. (1998) identified cDNAs encoding PAP41. The predicted 369-amino acid
protein exhibited 72%, 51%, and 50% sequence identity with PAP39, PRPS2,
and PRPS2, respectively. The rat and human PAP41 proteins are 99%
identical. Northern blot analysis revealed that PAP41 is expressed as a
2.1-kb mRNA in several human cell lines.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Katashima et al. (1998) mapped
the PRPSAP2 gene to 17p12-p11.2.

NUCLEAR FACTOR ASSOCIATED WITH DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA; NFAR
DESCRIPTION For background information, see NF45 (ILF2; 603181).

CLONING

Kao et al. (1994) cloned cDNAs encoding NF45 and NF90. The NF90 gene
encodes a 671-amino acid polypeptide with limited similarity to several
RNA-binding proteins. The NF90 gene also appears to encode an
alternatively spliced 404-amino acid polypeptide, of which the first 394
amino acids are identical to the longer clone. Northern and Western blot
analysis demonstrated NF45 and NF90 expression in several cell types,
including both unstimulated and stimulated Jurkat T cells.

By immunoscreening a HeLa cell cDNA library for phosphoproteins,
Matsumoto-Taniura et al. (1996) isolated a partial cDNA encoding ILF3,
which they termed MPP4. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that MPP4
encodes 90- and 110-kD proteins. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated cytoplasmic expression during M phase and nuclear/nucleolar
expression during interphase.

Patel et al. (1999) purified double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding
proteins from HeLa cell extracts and microsequenced a 90-kD protein with
identity to MPP4 in its N terminus. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with a
mutant RNA-activated protein kinase (PRKR; 176871) as bait, followed by
RT-PCR, they isolated a full-length cDNA encoding ILF3, which they
called DRBP76. Sequence analysis predicted that the 702-amino acid
protein has a bipartite nuclear localization signal, 2 dsRNA-binding
domains, an RG2 domain, and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a 90-kD protein, larger than the
calculated 76 kD. EMSA analysis confirmed the dsRNA binding activity of
DRBP76. Autoradiographic analysis indicated that DRBP76 is
phosphorylated by PRKR.

Langland et al. (1999) noted that NF90 is primarily localized to
ribosomes.

Saunders et al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding DRBP76, which they
termed NFAR1, as well as a variant cDNA encoding a 110-kD, 894-amino
acid protein they designated NFAR2. Sequence analysis showed that the
NFAR proteins share homology with a known PRKR substrate, the
translation initiation factor EIF2S1 (603907). Northern blot analysis
revealed ubiquitous expression of multiple transcripts ranging from 4.0
to 8.0 kb. Immunoblot analysis indicated variable expression with lower
amounts particularly notable in liver and spleen, suggesting
differential regulation at the translational or posttranslational level.
Immunoblot analysis and confocal microscopy demonstrated that PRKR and
both NFAR variants reciprocally coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize in
the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated an association with
spliceosomes.

Viranaicken et al. (2006) identified splice variants of human and mouse
ILF3 that encode long and short isoforms of the ILF3 and NF90 proteins
via inclusion or exclusion of 13 N-terminal residues, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Kao et al. (1994) showed that the NF45 and NF90 proteins form an NFAT
DNA-binding activity that is enhanced by T-cell stimulation and
inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506.

Functional analysis by Saunders et al. (2001) indicated that both NFAR
proteins regulate gene transcription, probably at the level of mRNA
elongation. NFAR2 exhibited potent, constitutive regulatory activity
through its unique C-terminal region, which specifically interacted with
FUS (137070) and SMN1 (600354). Saunders et al. (2001) concluded that
NFARs facilitate dsRNA-regulated gene expression at the level of
posttranscription.

Shim et al. (2002) showed that NF90 binds to a subregion of the 3-prime
untranslated region that contains several AU-rich elements (AREs) and
slows down the degradation of IL2 (147680) mRNA. In nonstimulated cells,
NF90 was mostly nuclear, but T-cell activation resulted in its
accumulation in the cytoplasm. The authors concluded that nuclear export
of NF90 is required for IL2 mRNA stabilization.

Pfeifer et al. (2008) found that NFAR1 and NFAR2 were involved in
retaining cellular transcripts in intranuclear foci and could regulate
mRNA export to the cytoplasm. They also remained associated with
exported ribonucleoprotein complexes. Treatment of HeLa cells with small
interfering RNA to NFAR1 and/or NFAR2 resulted in an increase in protein
synthesis rates, particularly in the presence the mRNA export factors
TAP (NXF1; 602647), p15 (NXT1; 605811), or RAE1 (603343). Depletion of
NFAR in mouse fibroblasts or HeLa cells dramatically increased their
susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis virus or influenza virus,
respectively. Pfeifer et al. (2008) concluded that NFAR1 and NFAR2 are
retained on polyribosomes and act to govern translation rates, and that
they also play a role in innate immune defense to virus infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Saunders et al. (2001) determined that the
NFAR gene contains 21 exons and spans 16.2 kb. The 90-kD NFAR1 variant
expresses exon 18, which contains several stop codons that lead to
termination at amino acid 702. The 110-kD NFAR2 variant lacks exon 18
but contains exons 19, 20, and 21.

Viranaicken et al. (2006) identified an additional alternatively spliced
exon within intron 2 of the mouse and human ILF3 genes, increasing the
total number of exons to 22.

MAPPING

Saunders et al. (2001) mapped the NFAR gene to chromosome 19p13 by FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pfeifer et al. (2008) found that mice lacking Nfar died in utero.

DULLARD, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF; DULLARD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Satow et al. (2002) cloned Xenopus Dullard and, by database analysis,
identified its human homolog. The deduced 261-amino acid human protein
shares 92% identity with Xenopus Dullard, and both have the conserved
C-terminal domain of NLIIF (CTDSP1; 605323). In Xenopus embryos, Dullard
mRNA localized to the animal hemisphere before the gastrula stage. It
was restricted to the neural region as gastrulation proceeded and
subsequently localized to the neural tissues, branchial arches, and
pronephroi at the tail-bud stages.

GENE FUNCTION

By translational knockdown, Satow et al. (2002) found that Dullard was
involved in neural development in Xenopus embryos. Overexpression of
Dullard led to apoptosis in early Xenopus development.

Satow et al. (2006) found that Dullard negatively regulated BMP (see
BMP1; 112264) signaling by promoting ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal
degradation of BMP receptors (see BMPR2; 600799) in Xenopus. Dullard
phosphatase activity was essential for degradation of BMP receptors and
neural induction in Xenopus.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the CTDNEP1 (DULLARD) gene to chromosome 17p13.1
based on an alignment of the CTDNEP1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ011916)
with the genomic sequence (build 36.1).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated immature myeloid

which they designated KIAA0013. The cDNA contains a repetitive element
at its 3-prime end, and the deduced 1,023-amino acid protein has a
rhoGAP domain and a putative tyrosine phosphorylation site. Northern

expression in placenta, kidney, testis, and colon, weak expression in
heart, brain, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas, spleen, ovary,
small intestine, and peripheral blood leukocytes, and none in prostate.

Nomura et al. (1994) presented sequence features, including
hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and regions of similarity to other known
genes, of genes identified by Nomura et al. (1994).

;;Fc-GAMMA-RIIC;;
FcRIIC;;
CD32C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FCGR2C is 1 of 3 genes that encode isoforms of FCGR2, also known as
CD32, a 40-kD glycoprotein that binds IgG with low affinity. FCGR2 is
widely distributed, being expressed on myeloid and lymphoid cells, as
well as nonhematopoietic cells. The FCGR2 isoforms exhibit differences
in ligand binding specificities, and triggering through different
isoforms results in distinct functions. FCGR2C is expressed on
monocytes, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear cells, and it appears to
be the only FCGR2 isoform expressed on natural killer (NK) cells. Due to
an allelic polymorphism, most individuals lack FCGR2C expression,
although some express high levels of FCGR2C capable of triggering
cytotoxicity by NK cells (Metes et al., 1998).

CLONING

Using mouse Fcgr2b2 to probe a placenta cDNA library, Stuart et al.
(1989) cloned human FCGR2C, which they termed FcRIIC. The predicted
323-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by a
175-amino acid ectodomain, a transmembrane segment, and a hydrophilic
44-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. The ectodomain of FCGR2C, which
contains evenly spaced cys residues and 3 potential N-glycosylation
sites, is identical to that of FCGR2B (604590) and highly similar to
that of FCGR2A (146790). In contrast, the cytoplasmic domain of FCGR2C
shares little sequence similarity with those of FCGR2A and FCGR2B.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of 2.5- and 1.6-kb FCGR2C
transcripts in macrophages, B cells, and trophoblasts, but not in
fibroblasts or T cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy of transfected
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells showed surface expression of FCGR2C.

By RT-PCR of resting and IL2 (147680)-activated NK cells, Metes et al.
(1998) isolated full-length FCGR2C and 3 FCGR2C splice variants. Two of
the variants encode proteins with truncated cytoplasmic tails, and the
third encodes a putative soluble protein truncated prior to the
transmembrane region. Flow cytometric and immunoprecipitation analyses
showed surface expression of a 40-kD FCGR2C protein on purified NK
cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Metes et al. (1998) determined that the FCGR2C gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

Using a BAC library, Su et al. (2002) determined that the FCGR2C gene
maps to chromosome 1q23, telomeric to the FCGR3A gene (146740) and
centromeric to the FCGR3B gene (610665).

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence analysis of transfected CHO cells, Stuart et al.
(1989) showed that FCGR2C bound heat-aggregated human IgG, but not human
myeloma IgA.

Metes et al. (1998) showed that NK cells expressing FCGR2C mediated
reverse antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

Breunis et al. (2008) found that, in individuals with a functional
FCGR2C (see MOLECULAR GENETICS), expression of FCGR2C on phagocytes and
NK cells enhanced effector function toward antibody-coated targets.
FCGR2C function was further enhanced under inflammatory conditions,
i.e., in the presence of IL15 (600554) or GMCSF (CSF2; 138960).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Metes et al. (1998) identified an allelic polymorphism within exon 3 of
FCGR2C that resulted in either a functional ORF containing gln13 or a
null allele containing a stop codon at position 13. They found that an
individual homozygous for the ORF allele exhibited a high level of
functional FCGR2C expression on NK cells, whereas an individual
homozygous for the null allele lacked FCGR2C expression on NK cells.
Distribution of the 4 FCGR2C isoforms on NK cells also appeared to be
donor dependent.

Su et al. (2002) found that the FCGR2C functional allele (202C) and the
FCGR2C null allele (202T) had frequencies of 0.12 and 0.88,
respectively, among 73 normal individuals.

Using an FCGR-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
assay, Breunis et al. (2008) demonstrated extensive variation in the
FCGR2 and FCGR3 gene clusters, including copy number variation in
FCGR2C. They found that 82% of a white control population had only the
FCGR2C null allele, resulting in the presence of a pseudogene, while the
remaining 18% had at least 1 ORF allele and expressed a functionally
activating FCGR2C on their immune cells. The FCGR2C ORF allele was
significantly overrepresented in patients with immune idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; 188030), with 34% of ITP patients having
at least 1 ORF allele.

Mueller et al. (2013) found that the increased risk of SLE associated
with reduced copy number of FCGR3B (610665) can be explained by the
presence of a chimeric gene, FCGR2B-prime, that occurs as a consequence
of FCGR3B deletion on FCGR3B zero-copy haplotypes. The FCGR2B-prime gene
consists of upstream elements and a 5-prime coding region that derive
from FCGR2C, and a 3-prime coding region that derives from FCGR2B
(604590). The coding sequence of FCGR2B-prime is identical to that of
FCGR2B, but FCGR2B-prime would be expected to be under the control of
5-prime flanking sequences derived from FCGR2C. Mueller et al. (2013)
found by flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and cDNA sequencing that
presence of the chimeric FCGR2B-prime gene results in the ectopic
presence of Fc-gamma-RIIb on NK cells, providing an explanation for SLE
risk associated with reduced FCGR3B copy number. To pursue the
underlying mechanism of SLE disease association with FCGR3B copy number
variation, Mueller et al. (2013) aligned the reference sequence (GRCh37)
of the proximal block of the FCGR locus (chr1:161,480,906-161,564,008)
to that of the distal block (chr1:161,562,570-161,645,839).
Identification of informative paralogous sequence variants (PSVs)
enabled Mueller et al. (2013) to narrow the potential breakpoint region
to a 24.5-kb region of paralogy between then 2 ancestral duplicated
blocks. The complete absence of nonpolymorphic PSVs in the 24.5-kb
region prevented more precise localization of the breakpoints in
FCGR3B-deleted or FCGR3B-duplicated haplotypes.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

607583	TITLE *607583 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 11G; PEX11G
;;PEX11-GAMMA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis and EST database searching using PEX11B
(603867) as query, Li et al. (2002) identified PEX11G and obtained the
full-length human and mouse cDNAs. Both human and mouse PEX11G contain
241 amino acids. Phylogenic analysis determined that PEX11G represents a
subfamily of PEX11 proteins distinct from the branch that includes
PEX11A (603866) and PEX11B. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
detected tissue-specific expression, with high levels in liver and much
lower levels in other tissues. Pex11g expression was below the level of
detection in mouse fibroblasts. Transfection of epitope-tagged PEX11G
into a human fibroblast cell line revealed colocalization with PEX14
(601791), a peroxisome marker protein. Analysis of PEX11G domains
detected in permeabilized cells suggested that PEX11G is a peroxisomal
membrane protein with both the N and C termini exposed to the cytoplasm.

Using homology with PEX11A, Tanaka et al. (2003) identified PEX11G. They
cloned the full-length PEX11G cDNA by RT-PCR of fibroblasts from a
patient with peroxisome biogenesis disorder, complementation group 11
(601757). The deduced 241-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 27 kD. PEX11G contains 2 membrane-spanning segments. By
differential permeabilization, Tanaka et al. (2003) confirmed that the N
and C termini of PEX11G are exposed to the cytosol.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2002) found that Pex11g expression in mouse liver was not
induced by ciprofibrate, and no change in Pex11g expression was detected
in cells lacking either Pex11a or Pex11b. Overexpression of PEX11G did
not increase peroxisome abundance, but induced tubulation, enlargement,
and clustering of peroxisomes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tanaka et al. (2003) mapped the PEX11G
gene to chromosome 19p13.3.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus is spatially and functionally separated
from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope. All molecular transport
across the nuclear envelope takes place exclusively through the nuclear
pore. Small molecules, such as ions and polypeptides smaller than
approximately 40 kD, pass freely through the nuclear pore, but larger
molecules require a carrier protein. The nuclear pore is formed by the
nuclear pore complex (NPC), an 8-fold symmetrical structure composed of
multiple copies of about 30 different proteins called nucleoporins. The
NUP98 gene encodes a NUP98-NUP96 precursor protein that is cleaved by
its own peptidase activity to produce 2 distinct nucleoporins, NUP98 and
NUP96. Alternative splicing also generates NUP98 transcripts that encode
NUP98, but not NUP96. NUP98 is a peripheral nucleoporin located at both
the cytoplasmic and nuclear sides of the central channel of the NPC. It
contains a characteristic gly-leu-phe-gly (GFLG) repeat region that
contributes to nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking, including mRNA export.
NUP98 also plays roles in gene expression, mitotic checkpoint, and
pathogenesis. NUP96 is a scaffold component of the NPC (review by
Iwamoto et al., 2010).

CLONING

Fontoura et al. (1999) identified NUP96 as a nucleoporin with a
predicted molecular mass of 96 kD. NUP96 is generated through an unusual
biogenesis pathway that involves synthesis of a 186-kD precursor
protein. Proteolytic cleavage of the precursor yields 2 nucleoporins:
NUP98 and NUP96. NUP96 is proteolytically cleaved in vivo. NUP96 is
localized to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC at or near the
nucleoplasmic basket. The correct targeting of both NUP96 and NUP98 to
the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC was found to be dependent on
proteolytic cleavage, suggesting that the cleavage process may regulate
NPC assembly.

In their review, Iwamoto et al. (2010) noted that alternative splicing
produces 4 human NUP98 variants. Variants 1 and 4 are generated by
alternative splicing in exon 20 and are translated into the NUP98-NUP96
precursor protein. Variants 2 and 3 are generated without splicing in
exon 20 and are translated into NUP98 connected to a 57-amino acid
polypeptide tail that is removed from NUP98 by autocleavage. Variants 1
and 4 differ from one another due to alternative splicing in exon 29,
and variants 2 and 3 differ from one another due to alternative splicing
in exon 10.

MAPPING

Nakamura et al. (1996) mapped the NUP98 gene to 11p15 by analysis of a
panel of somatic cell hybrids and by pulsed field gel electrophoresis.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunogold electron microscopy, Radu et al. (1995) localized the
NUP98 protein to the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore. Nakamura et
al. (1996) stated that ligand blot analysis suggested that NUP98
functions as a docking protein for cytosol-mediated docking of import
substrates. The docking function has been localized to the N-terminal
half of NUP98, the part of NUP98 that is retained in the NUP98/HOXA9
fusion (Radu et al., 1995).

Rosenblum and Blobel (1999) determined that no protease is involved in
the processing of the NUP98-NUP96 precursor, but the molecule
specifically cleaves itself between phe863 and ser864. The 2 fragments
then form a low-affinity complex.

Von Kobbe et al. (2000) demonstrated that NUP98 is a target of the
vesicular stomatitis virus M protein-mediated inhibition of mRNA nuclear
export.

Enninga et al. (2002) demonstrated that NUP98 and NUP96 are upregulated
by interferon. M protein-mediated inhibition of mRNA nuclear export was
reversed when cells were treated with interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) or
transfected with a cDNA encoding NUP98 and NUP96. Enninga et al. (2002)
concluded that increased NUP98 and NUP96 expression constitutes an
IFN-mediated mechanism that reverses M protein-mediated inhibition of
gene expression.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Enninga et al. (2003) determined that
SEC13L1 (600152) and an N-terminal region of NUP96 interact. By mutation
analysis, they determined that the WD repeat region of SEC13L1 and
residues 201 to 378 of NUP96 were required for the interaction. SEC13L1
did not bind NUP98. During mitosis, SEC13L1 was dispersed throughout the
cell, whereas a pool of NUP96 colocalized with the spindle apparatus.

Jeganathan et al. (2005) showed that in mitosis, timely destruction of
securin (604147) by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is regulated by
the nucleocytoplasmic transport factors Rae1 (603343) and Nup98. They
showed that combined haploinsufficiency for Rae1 and Nup98 in mice
results in premature separation of sister chromatids, severe aneuploidy,
and untimely degradation of securin. They also determined that Rae1 and
Nup98 form a complex with cadherin-1 (Cdh1; 192090)-activated APC,
APC(Cdh1), in early mitosis and specifically inhibit APC(Cdh1)-mediated
ubiquitination of securin. Dissociation of Rae1 and Nup98 from APC(Cdh1)
coincides with the release of the mitotic checkpoint protein BubR1
(602860) from Cdc20 (603618)-activated APC at the metaphase to anaphase
transition. Jeganathan et al. (2005) concluded that together, their
results suggest that Rae1 and Nup98 are temporal regulators of APC(Cdh1)
that maintain euploidy by preventing unscheduled degradation of securin.

Wang et al. (2009) reported that fusing an histone H3 lysine-4
trimethylation (H3K4me3)-binding PHD finger, such as the C-terminal PHD
finger of PHF23 (612910) or JARID1A (180202), to a common fusion partner
NUP98, as identified in human leukemias (Reader et al., 2007; van Zutven
et al., 2006), generated potent oncoproteins that arrested hematopoietic
differentiation and induced acute myeloid leukemia in murine models. In
these processes, a PHD finger that specifically recognizes H3K4me3/2
marks was essential for leukemogenesis. Mutations in PHD fingers that
abrogated H3K4me3 binding also abolished leukemic transformation.
NUP98-PHD fusion prevented the differentiation-associated removal of
H3K4me3 at many loci encoding lineage-specific transcription factors
such as Hox(s) (see 142950), Gata3 (131320), Meis1 (601739), Eya1
(601653), and Pbx1 (176310), and enforced their active gene
transcription in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.
Mechanistically, NUP98-PHD fusions act as 'chromatin boundary factors,'
dominating over polycomb-mediated gene silencing to 'lock'
developmentally critical loci into an active chromatin state (H3K4me3
with induced histone acetylation), a state that defined leukemia stem
cells. Wang et al. (2009) concluded that their studies represented the
first report that deregulation of the PHD finger, an effector of
specific histone modification, perturbs the epigenetic dynamics on
developmentally critical loci, leading to catastrophic cell fate
decision making and oncogenesis during mammalian development.

Rapid disassembly of the NPC during mitotic entry requires the master
mitotic kinase CDK1 (116940) and involves phosphorylation of many
nucleoporins. Laurell et al. (2011) identified phosphorylation of NUP98
as an early and crucial step during NPC disassembly in HeLa cells.
Recombinant NUP98 was hyperphosphorylated by PLK1 (602098), NEK6
(604884), and other NEK family members in vitro. Mass spectrometric
analysis revealed that NUP98 was phosphorylated on ser591 and ser822 by
NEK6 and on thr529, thr536, ser595, ser606, and thr653 by CDK1.
Phosphomimetic mutants of NUP98 localized to the cytoplasm instead of
NPCs. Conversely, phosphodeficient NUP98 mutants significantly delayed
NPC disassembly and loss of the nuclear envelope permeability barrier.
Laurell et al. (2011) concluded that NUP98 phosphorylation is critical
for NPC disassembly at the onset of mitosis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Hodel et al. (2002) reported that the 3-dimensional structure of the
C-terminal domain of NUP98 revealed a novel protein fold, and thus a new
class of autocatalytic proteases. The structure further indicated that
the nucleoporin RNA-binding motif is unlikely to bind to RNA. The C
terminus was found to contain sequences that target NUP98 to the nuclear
pore complex. Noncovalent interactions between the C-terminal domain and
the cleaved peptide tail were visible and suggested a model for
cleavage-dependent targeting of NUP98 to the nuclear pore.

CYTOGENETICS

Lam and Aplan (2001) reviewed gene fusions involving NUP98. The NUP98
gene is fused to 1 of a considerable number of other genes in various
hematologic malignancies as a consequence of chromosomal translocation.
The common theme in all NUP98 chimeras is a transcript consisting of the
5-prime part of NUP98 and the 3-prime portion of the partner gene.
However, apart from the frequent fusion to different homeobox genes,
there is no apparent similarity among the other partners.

Nakamura et al. (1996) showed that in 3 patients with t(7;11), the
chromosome rearrangement created a genomic fusion between the HOXA9 gene
(142956) and the nucleoporin gene NUP98 on 11p15. Expression of Hoxa7
and Hoxa9 is activated by proviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid
leukemias; this result, combined with the mapping of the HOXA cluster to
7p15, suggested that one of the HOXA genes may be involved in the human
t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation found in some myeloid leukemia patients.
The translocation produced an invariant chimeric NUP98/HOXA9 transcript
containing the amino terminal half of NUP98 fused in-frame to HOXA9.
These studies identified HOXA9 as an important human myeloid leukemia
gene and suggested an important role for nucleoporins in human myeloid
leukemia, given that a second nucleoporin, NUP214 (114350), had also
been implicated in human myeloid leukemia. The 11p15 gene was identified
by exon trapping experiments.

Borrow et al. (1996) likewise identified the HOXA9 and NUP98 genes as
the parents of the fusion in t(7;11)(p15;p15) in acute myeloid leukemia
of the FABM2 and M4 types. Borrow et al. (1996) suggested that the
predicted NUP98/HOXA9 fusion protein may promote leukemogenesis through
inhibition of HOXA9-mediated terminal differentiation and/or aberrant
nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Hussey et al. (1999) identified the breakpoint genes of the
translocation t(4;11)(q21;p15) that occurred in a case of adult T-cell
acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL). By analysis of somatic cell hybrids,
they showed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint occurred within the NUP98
gene, which is rearranged in several acute myeloid leukemia
translocations. Using 3-prime RACE, Hussey et al. (1999) identified the
fusion partner of NUP98 as RAP1GDS1 (179502). This was the first report
of the involvement of RAP1GDS1 in any malignancy. The product of the
RAP1GDS1 gene, usually referred to as smgGDS, has guanine nucleotide
exchange factor activity (Mizuno et al., 1991). In the fusion
transcript, which the authors referred to as NRG, the 5-prime end of the
NUP98 gene was joined in-frame to the coding region of the RAP1GDS1
gene. This joined the FG repeat-rich region of NUP98 to RAP1GDS1, which
largely consists of tandem armadillo repeats. Hussey et al. (1999) found
that the NRG fusion maintained the reading frame of RAP1GDS1. The
RAP1GDS1 sequence in NRG started at nucleotide 5 of the coding sequence.
The methionine and the first G of the codon for aspartic acid were lost.
However, the first aspartic acid was retained in the fusion protein,
because the last base of NUP98 exon B is a G. Hussey et al. (1999)
showed that this translocation is recurrent in T-ALL.

Nakamura et al. (1999) studied a translocation fusion gene in acute
myelogenous leukemia in which the promoter of the nucleoporin gene on
11p15 was fused to the DNA-binding domain of PRRX1 (167420).

Jaju et al. (1999) identified a recurrent cryptic translocation,
t(5;11)(q35;p15.5), associated with a deletion of the long arm of
chromosome 5 in de novo childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML; see
601626). Jaju et al. (2001) confirmed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint
gene is NUP98 and cloned the chromosome 5 fusion partner, NSD1 (606681).
Nucleotide 1552 of NUP98 was fused in-frame to nucleotide 3504 of NSD1.

Constitutive activation of tyrosine kinases, such as the BCR/ABL
(151410, 189980) fusion associated with t(9;22)(q34;q22), is a hallmark
of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 608232) in humans. Expression of
BCR/ABL is both necessary and sufficient to cause a chronic
myeloproliferative syndrome in murine bone marrow transplantation
models, and depends absolutely on kinase activity. Progression of CML to
acute leukemia (blast crisis) in humans had been associated with
acquisition of secondary chromosomal translocations, including the
t(7;11)(p15;p15) resulting in the NUP98/HOXA9 fusion protein. Dash et
al. (2002) demonstrated that BCR/ABL cooperates with NUP98/HOXA9 to
cause blast crisis in the murine model. The phenotype depends on
expression of both BCR/ABL and NUP98/HOXA9, but tumors retain
sensitivity to the ABL inhibitor STI571 in vitro and in vivo. This
paradigm is applicable to other constitutively activated tyrosine
kinases such as TEL/PDGFRB (600618, 173410). The experiments of Dash et
al. (2002) documented cooperative effects between constitutively
activated tyrosine kinases, which confer proliferative and survival
properties to hematopoietic cells, with mutations that impair
differentiation, such as the NUP98/HOXA9 fusion, giving rise to the
acute myeloid leukemia phenotype. Furthermore, these data indicated that
despite acquisition of additional mutations, CML blast crisis cells
retain their dependence on BCR/ABL for proliferation and survival.

Rosati et al. (2002) reported a fusion between the NUP98 and NSD3
(607083) genes in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia associated with
t(8;11)(p11.2;p15). Hitherto, acute myeloid leukemia had been reported
with translocations creating chimeric genes between NUP98 and PMX1
(PRRX1), HOXD13 (142989), NSD1, HOXA9, LEDGF, DDX10 (601235), and TOP1
(126420). In patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
t(4;11)(q21;p21), fusion of the NUP98 gene to the RAP1GDS1 gene had been
observed (Hussey et al., 1999).

Arai et al. (1997) showed that the recurrent chromosome abnormality
inv(11)(p15q22), which is associated with de novo and therapy-related
myeloid malignancies, results in fusion of the nucleoporin gene NUP98
with DDX10. In DDX10 and NUP98, the inv(11) breakpoints occurred within
2 introns of each gene, and the 2 genes merged in-frame to produce the
chimeric transcripts characteristic of this translocation. Although 2
reciprocal chimeric products, NUP98-DDX10 and DDX10-NUP98, were
predicted, only NUP98-DDX10 appeared to be implicated in tumorigenesis.
DDX10 is involved in ribosome assembly, and NUP98 is a nuclear pore
complex protein and a target of other chromosomal translocations found
in AML. Arai et al. (1997) predicted the NUP98-DDX10 fusion protein may
promote leukemogenesis through aberrant nucleoplasmic transport of mRNA
or alterations in ribosome assembly.

Ahuja et al. (1999) cloned and characterized a t(11;20)(p15;q11)
translocation from patients with therapy-related AML and therapy-related
myelodysplastic syndromes. They found that the breakpoint on 11p15
targets the NUP98 gene and results in the separation of the N-terminal
FXFG repeats from the RNA-binding domain located in the C terminus. The
breakpoint on 20q11 occurred within the TOP1 gene. As a result, a
chimeric mRNA encoding the NUP98 FXFG repeats fused to the body of TOP1.
Ahuja et al. (1999) concluded that NUP98 is a recurrent target in
therapy-related malignancies and that TOP1 is a previously unrecognized
target for chromosomal translocations.

Taketani et al. (2002) found that in the t(2;11)(q31;p15) translocation
2 alternatively spliced 5-prime NUP98 transcripts were fused in-frame to
the HOXD11 gene (142986). The NUP98/HOXD fusion genes encode similar
fusion proteins, suggesting that NUP98/HOXD11 and NUP98/HOXD13 fusion
proteins play a role in leukemogenesis through similar mechanisms.

The NUP98 gene had been found at the breakpoints of several distinct
chromosomal translocations in patients with both de novo and
therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes and AML. Using combined
cytogenetic and molecular analyses, Ahuja et al. (2001) found
rearrangements of the NUP98 gene in the leukemic cells of 2 patients
with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML during disease evolution.
Analysis of the t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation from 1 of the patients
showed an in-frame NUP98/HOXA9 fusion. The fusion points were similar to
those previously reported from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes
or AML. The results indicated that the NUP98 gene is an additional,
albeit infrequent, genetic target during clonal evolution of CML.

Panagopoulos et al. (2003) reported a patient with de novo AML with a
t(11;12)(p15;q13) translocation resulting in a novel NUP98/HOXC13
(142976) fusion gene. FISH analyses showed a fusion signal on the
derivative chromosome 11, indicating a NUP98/HOXC chimera, whereas no
fusion was found on the derivative chromosome 12, suggesting that the
reciprocal fusion gene was deleted. Thus, NUP98/HOXC13 is of
pathogenetic importance in t(11;12)-positive AML.

Lahortiga et al. (2003) noted that the NUP98 gene had been reported to
be fused to 13 partner genes in hematologic malignancies with 11p15
translocations. Twelve of the 13 had been identified in patients with
myeloid neoplasias and only 1, RAP1GDS1, was fused with NUP98 in 5
patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Three of these
patients coexpressed T cell and myeloid markers, suggesting a specific
association of RAP1GDS1 fusion with a subset of T-ALL originated from an
early progenitor, which has a potential to express mature T-cell
antigens as well as myeloid markers. Lahortiga et al. (2003) described a
new NUP98 partner involved in a t(10;11)(q25;p15) in a patient with
acute biphenotypic leukemia, showing coexpression of mature T cell and
myeloid markers. The gene involved, located at 10q25, was identified as
adducin-3 (ADD3; 601568) using 3-prime RACE. ADD3 codes for the
ubiquitously expressed subunit gamma of the adducin protein and it seems
to play an important role in the skeletal organization of the cell
membrane. Both NUP98/ADD3 and ADD3/NUP98 fusion transcription were
expressed in the patient. Adducin shares with the product of RAP1GDS1,
and with all of the nonhomeobox NUP98 partners, the presence of a region
with significant probability of adopting a coiled-coil conformation.
This region is always retained in the fusion transcript with the NH2
terminus FG repeats of NUP98, suggesting an important role in the
mechanism of leukemogenesis.

Panagopoulos et al. (2006) reported the case of a fourth NUP98 chimera
in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; a t(11;18)(p15;q12) resulted in
a novel NUP98 fusion. They found that exon 12 of NUP98 was fused
in-frame with exon 5 SETBP1. Nested PCR did not amplify the reciprocal
SETBP1/NUP98, suggesting that the NUP98/SETBP1 transcript is
pathogenetically important.

In a 42-year-old man with AML, Reader et al. (2007) identified a cryptic
translocation, t(11;17)(p15;p13), that resulted in in-frame fusion of
exon 13 of NUP98 to exon 4 of PHF23 (612910). The deduced chimeric
protein contains the N-terminal half of NUP98 fused to the C-terminal
functional domains of PHF23.

Such et al. (2011) identified a NUP98/RARG (180190) fusion gene
resulting from a t(11;12)(p15;p13) translocation in bone marrow cells
derived from a 35-year-old man with AML that had morphologic and
immunophenotypic features of the hypergranular subtype of acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376). Sequence analysis determined that
NUP98 exon 12 was fused in-frame to RARG exon 4, predicted to encode an
862-residue protein with aberrant RARG receptor function. The patient
was treated with standard chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation;
response to ATRA was not assessed.

Tosi et al. (2005) identified a translocation, t(6;11)(q24.1;p15.5), in
a patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. RT-PCR and sequencing
revealed a transcript that contained exon 13 of NUP98 fused in-frame
with exon 2 of C6ORF80 (CCDC28A; 615353). The reciprocal fusion
transcript was not detected.

Petit et al. (2012) found that the NUP98-CCDC28A transcript contains
1,833 nucleotides of NUP98 fused in-frame to nucleotide 384 of CDCD28A.
The resultant 712-amino acid protein contains the N-terminal
transactivating GLFG repeats of NUP98 fused to CCDC28A beginning at
amino acid 77 and including its C-terminal coiled-coil domain. The
fusion protein was expressed in the nucleus following transfection of
primary mouse bone marrow cells. Immortalized mouse cells expressing
human NUP98-CCDC28A exhibited myeloblast morphology, proliferated in a
cytokine-independent manner, and caused fatal myeloproliferative
neoplasms in transplanted mice, with selective expansion of
granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in bone marrow.

ANIMAL MODEL

Iwasaki et al. (2005) generated transgenic mice in which the NUP98/HOXA9
fusion gene was specifically expressed in the myeloid lineage under the
control of the cathepsin G promoter. Approximately 20% of the transgenic
mice developed acute myeloid leukemia after a long latency period. When
NUP98/HOXA9 was introduced into the sensitive BXH2 mouse strain, it
promoted onset of retrovirus-induced myeloid leukemia. By examining
common retrovirus integration sites in these mice, Iwasaki et al. (2005)
found that Meis1 (601739), Dnalc4 (610565), Fcgr2b (604590), Fcrl
(606891), and Con1 cooperated with NUP98/HOXA9 in promoting the
development of myeloid leukemias. Using a transformation assay with
mouse NIH3T3 cells, Iwasaki et al. (2005) confirmed that these genes
cooperated with NUP98/HOXA9 in inducing the transformed phenotype,
although none alone were transforming.
