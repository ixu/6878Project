DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Hsu et al. (1996) identified a human gene, CRY2, whose product had 73%
amino acid identity to the human (6-4)photolyase (CRY1; 601933). The
CRY2 protein shares 51% amino acid sequence identity to Drosophila
(6-4)photolyase. Hsu et al. (1996) purified the human CRY1 and CRY2
proteins and characterized them as maltose-binding fusion proteins that
contain FAD and a pterin cofactor. Both CRY1 and CRY2 proteins lacked
photolyase activity. Hsu et al. (1996) concluded that these proteins are
not photolyases, but may function as blue-light photoreceptors in
humans.

As part of a search for human brain cDNA clones with the potential to
encode large proteins in vitro, Ishikawa et al. (1998) independently
identified CRY2. The CRY2 open reading frame encodes a protein of 589
amino acids with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kD.

Kobayashi et al. (1998) isolated and characterized mouse Cry1 and Cry2.
While Cry1 is localized to the mitochondria, Cry2 is found mainly in the
nucleus. The C termini of both mouse Cry2 and human CRY2 each contain a
nuclear localization signal, and the N terminus of mouse Cry1 contains a
mitochondrial transport signal. Cry1 protein bound tightly to DNA
Sepharose, while Cry2 protein did not.

GENE FUNCTION

Griffin et al. (1999) showed that human CRY1 and CRY2 act as
light-independent inhibitors of a heterodimeric activator consisting of
CLOCK (601851) and BMAL1 (602550), the activator driving Per1 (602260)
transcription, very likely by means of direct contacts between CRY1 and
BMAL1 and between CRY2 and CLOCK. They concluded that CRY1 and CRY2
occupy a central position within the mammalian circadian clock,
virtually at the interface between CLOCK-BMAL1 and PER1, PER2 (603426),
and TIM (603887). Griffin et al. (1999) suggested that Drosophila CRY
exemplifies the ancestral role of the photoreceptor acting as a
light-dependent regulator of the circadian feedback loop, whereas
mammalian CRYs have preserved the role within the circadian feedback
loop but have shed their direct photoreceptor function.

Kume et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Cry1 and Cry2 genes act in
the negative limb of the clock feedback loop. They stated that mouse
Cry1 and Cry2 are nuclear proteins that interact with each of the Per
proteins, translocate each Per protein from cytoplasm to nucleus, and
are rhythmically expressed in the suprachiasmatic circadian clock.
Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that Cry1 or Cry2 alone abrogates
Clock/Bmal1 (602550) E box-mediated transcription. The mouse Per and Cry
proteins appeared to inhibit the transcriptional complex differentially.

Etchegaray et al. (2003) demonstrated that transcriptional regulation of
the core clock mechanism in mouse liver is accompanied by rhythms in H3
histone (see 602810) acetylation, and that H3 acetylation is a potential
target of the inhibitory action of Cry. The promoter regions of the
Per1, Per2, and Cry1 genes exhibited circadian rhythms in H3 acetylation
and RNA polymerase II (see 180660) binding that were synchronous with
the corresponding steady-state mRNA rhythms. The histone
acetyltransferase p300 (602700) precipitated with Clock in vivo in a
time-dependent manner. Moreover, the Cry proteins inhibited a
p300-induced increase in Clock/Bmal1-mediated transcription. Etchegaray
et al. (2003) concluded that the delayed timing of the Cry1 mRNA rhythm,
relative to the Per rhythms, was due to the coordinated activities of
Rev-Erb-alpha (602408) and Clock/Bmal1, and defined a novel mechanism
for circadian phase control.

Lamia et al. (2011) showed that 2 circadian coregulators, Cry1 (601933)
and Cry2, interact with glucocorticoid receptor (138040) in a
ligand-dependent fashion and globally alter the transcriptional response
to glucocorticoids in mouse embryonic fibroblasts: cryptochrome
deficiency vastly decreases gene repression and approximately doubles
the number of dexamethasone-induced genes, suggesting that cryptochromes
broadly oppose glucocorticoid receptor activation and promote
repression. In mice, genetic loss of Cry1 and/or 2 results in glucose
intolerance and constitutively high levels of circulating
corticosterone, suggesting reduced suppression of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis coupled with increased
glucocorticoid transactivation in the liver. Genomically, Cry1 and Cry2
associate with a glucocorticoid response element in the
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-1 (PCK1; 614168) promoter in a
hormone-dependent manner, and dexamethasone-induced transcription of the
Pck1 gene was strikingly increased in cryptochrome-deficient livers.
Lamia et al. (2011) concluded that their results revealed a specific
mechanism through which cryptochromes couple the activity of clock and
receptor target genes to complex genomic circuits underpinning normal
metabolic homeostasis.

In mammals, PERIOD (PER1; 602260 and PER2; 603426) and CRYPTOCHROME
(CRY1 and CRY2) proteins accumulate, form a large nuclear complex (PER
complex), and repress their own transcription. Padmanabhan et al. (2012)
found that mouse PER complexes included RNA helicases DDX5 (180630) and
DHX9 (603115), active RNA polymerase II large subunit (180660), Per and
Cry pre-mRNAs, and SETX (608465), a helicase that promotes
transcriptional termination. During circadian negative feedback, RNA
polymerase II accumulated near termination sites on Per and Cry genes
but not on control genes. Recruitment of PER complexes to the elongating
polymerase at Per and Cry termination sites inhibited SETX action,
impeding RNA polymerase II release and thereby repressing
transcriptional reinitiation. Circadian clock negative feedback thus
includes direct control of transcriptional termination.

MAPPING

Kobayashi et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Cry1 and Cry2 genes to
chromosomes 10C and 2E, respectively. Using a GeneBridge 4 radiation
hybrid panel, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the human CRY2 gene to
chromosome 11.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Xing et al. (2013) reported the crystal structures of mammalian CRY2 in
its apo, FAD-bound, and FBXL3 (605653)-SKP1 (601434)-complexed forms.
Distinct from other cryptochromes, mammalian CRY2 binds FAD dynamically
with an open cofactor pocket. Notably, the F-box protein FBXL3 captures
CRY2 by simultaneously occupying its FAD-binding pocket with a conserved
carboxy-terminal tail and burying its PER-binding interface.

ANIMAL MODEL

Van der Horst et al. (1999) disrupted the Cry1 and Cry2 genes in mice.
Homozygous Cry1 -/-, Cry2 -/-, and double-mutant mice had normal 24-hour
circadian rhythms when exposed to 12h/12h light/dark cycles. In total
darkness, Cry1 -/- mice had a faster running clock (22.51 +/- 0.06h, P =
0.00001) than wildtype mice, while Cry2 -/- mice had a slower clock
(24.63 +/- 0.06 hours, P = 0.00001). Double-mutant mice in total
darkness showed a striking instantaneous and complete arrhythmicity,
indicating the absence of an internal circadian clock. The 'clock'
mutant mouse differs in showing a more gradual onset of arrhythmicity.
Mice with only 1 copy of wildtype Cry2 displayed a free-running rhythm
even shorter than that of Cry1 knockouts, which gradually progressed
into arrhythmicity. Once returned to a light/dark cycle, the normal
24-hour period resumed. Mice with only one functional allele of Cry1
showed rhythmic activity with a period intermediate to those of Cry1 -/-
and Cry2 -/- mice. The authors concluded that their results demonstrated
that the Cry proteins are involved in maintaining period length and
circadian rhythmicity, and that a critical balance between Cry1 and Cry2
is required for proper clock functioning.

Thresher et al. (1998) disrupted the mouse Cry2 gene by homologous
recombination. The mutant mice had lowered sensitivity to acute light
induction of the Per1 gene in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but
exhibited normal circadian oscillations of Per1 and Cry1 mRNA in the
SCN. Behaviorally, the mutants had an intrinsic circadian period about 1
hour longer than normal and exhibited high amplitude phase shifts in
response to light pulses administered at circadian time 17. The authors
considered these data consistent with the hypothesis that Cry2 protein
modulates circadian responses in mice and suggested that cryptochromes
have a role in circadian photoreception in mammals.

Freedman et al. (1999) studied circadian behavior in mice deficient in
both rods and cones. These mice maintained a light-entrained circadian
rhythm, which they lost with enucleation. Lucas et al. (1999) studied
pineal melatonin secretion in mice lacking both rods and cones. There
was normal suppression of pineal melatonin in response to monochromatic
light of wavelength 509 nm. These authors concluded that mammals have
additional ocular photoreceptors which they use in the regulation of
temporal physiology, and suggested CRY1 and CRY2 as candidates.

Okamura et al. (1999) demonstrated that, in mice lacking Cry1 and Cry2,
cyclic expression of the clock genes Per1 and Per2 is abolished in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissues and that Per1 and Per2
mRNA levels are constitutively high. These findings indicated that the
biologic clock is eliminated in the absence of both Cry1 and Cry2 and
supported the idea that mammalian CRY proteins act in the negative limb
of the circadian feedback loop. The Cry double mutant mice retained the
ability to have Per1 and Per2 expression induced by a brief light
stimulus known to phase-shift the biologic clock in wildtype animals.
Thus, Cry1 and Cry2 are dispensable for light-induced phase shifting of
the biologic clock.

Shearman et al. (2000) demonstrated that in the mouse, the core
mechanism for the master circadian clock consists of interacting
positive and negative transcription and translation feedback loops.
Analysis of Clock/Clock mutant mice, homozygous Per2 mutants, and
Cry-deficient mice revealed substantially altered Bmal1 rhythms,
consistent with a dominant role of Per2 in the positive regulation of
the Bmal1 loop. In vitro analysis of Cry inhibition of
Clock:Bmal1-mediated transcription shows that the inhibition is through
direct protein-protein interactions, independent of the Per and Tim
proteins. Per2 is a positive regulator of the Bmal1 loop, and Cry1 and
Cry2 are the negative regulators of the Period and Cryptochrome cycles.

Yagita et al. (2001) used wildtype and Cry1 -/- and Cry2 -/- deficient
cell lines derived from Cry mutant mice to demonstrate that the
peripheral oscillator in cultured fibroblasts is identical to the
oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in (1) temporal expression
profiles of all known clock genes; (2) the phase of the various mRNA
rhythms (i.e., antiphase oscillation of Bmal1 (602550) and Per); (3) the
delay between maximum mRNA levels and appearance of nuclear Per1 and
Per2 protein; (4) the inability to produce oscillations in the absence
of functional Cry genes; and (5) the control of period length by Cry
proteins.

Van Gelder et al. (2003) tested pupillary light responses of
cryptochrome mutant mice (Cry1 -/-; Cry2 -/-), outer retinal degenerate
(rd/rd) mice, and mice mutant at all of these loci, as well littermate
controls. There was substantial loss of constriction in the rd/rd mice
compared with control mice. The double mutants for the cryptochromes
showed a pupillary response similar in magnitude to that in control
mice. Almost no pupillary constriction was observed in the triple
knockouts at a 470-nm light intensity. Pupillary responses of the triple
mutants were about 5% as sensitive to blue light as those of the rd/rd
mice. Some pupillary responses were retained in the triple mutant mice
under very bright light, although pupillary movement was somewhat
sluggish. The 50% constriction threshold of pupillary responses was
noted in Cry1 -/-;rd/rd and Cry2 -/-;rd/rd mice, and was comparable to
those of rd/rd mice, indicating that either Cry1 or Cry2 function is
sufficient for retention of pupillary responses in rd/rd animals. Since
all mice were of the same strain background, strain differences were
unlikely to account for the observed differences in pupillary light
responses. Van Gelder et al. (2003) suggested that murine cryptochromes
may function as inner retinal photopigments.

NONCODING RNA 54; NCRNA00054
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant soft tissue tumor in children that
exists in 2 major types, embryonal, or RMS1 (268210), and the clinically
more aggressive alveolar, or RMS2 (268220). Using representational
difference analysis to compare gene expression in RMS1 and RMS2,
followed by RACE and EST database searching, Chan et al. (2002)
identified a gene encoding NCRMS, which was preferentially expressed in
RMS2. Northern blot analysis detected 1.25- and 1.8-kb transcripts in
RMS2 cells and in tissues, with weak expression in most other tumor
types tested. Sequence analysis identified multiple stop codons but no
likely protein-coding reading frames. Chan et al. (2002) concluded that
NCRMS is a noncoding RNA that may be important in myogenesis and in the
development of RMS.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Chan et al. (2002) determined that the
NCRMS gene contains at least 11 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Chan et al.
(2002) mapped the RMST gene to chromosome 12q21.

300462	TITLE *300462 A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN 14; AKAP14
;;A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN, 28-KD; AKAP28
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449) target protein kinase A
(PKA; see 176911) to discrete locations within the cell by binding the
regulatory subunit dimer of the PKA holoenzyme. AKAP28 is an axonemal
AKAP.

CLONING

Kultgen et al. (2002) identified AKAP28 as an axoneme-enriched PKA type
II regulatory subunit (RII)-binding protein by overlay analysis of
isolated cilia from well-differentiated human bronchial epithelial
(WD-HBE) cells. By screening a WD-HBE cDNA expression library using RII
as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE and database analysis,
Kultgen et al. (2002) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding AKAP28. The
deduced AKAP28 protein contains 197 amino acids and has an apparent
molecular mass of 28 kD. By database analysis, Kultgen et al. (2002)
determined that there are at least 3 AKAP28 splice variants, and RT-PCR
detected all 3 variants in trachea and testis. Northern blot analysis of
HBE cells detected upregulation of a 0.8-kb AKAP28 transcript as cells
differentiated and began to display a mucociliary phenotype. Northern
blot analysis of a multiple-tissue array showed predominant expression
of AKAP28 in trachea and testis, the only tissues examined that contain
axoneme-based organelles. Faint expression was also detected in adult
and fetal lung. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry localized
AKAP28 to airway cilia.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation analysis, Kultgen et al. (2002) confirmed that amino acids
35 to 52 of AKAP28 mediate binding of RII. Coimmunoprecipitation
analysis showed that recombinant AKAP28 associated with RII and the PKA
catalytic subunit, but not with RI, in HeLa cells. When heterologously
expressed in a cervical adenocarcinoma cell line, AKAP28 preferentially
bound type II PKA and was able to copurify with the PKA catalytic
subunit. Kultgen et al. (2002) concluded that AKAP28 acts as a type II
PKA anchor within cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kultgen et al. (2002) mapped the AKAP28
gene to chromosome Xq24.

600870	TITLE *600870 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR KINASE 5; GRK5
;;GPRK5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs), such as GRK5, are
important regulators of GPCR function and mediate receptor
desensitization, internalization, and signaling. Several non-GPCR
proteins also serve as GRK substrates, and GRKs have been shown to have
kinase-independent functions in receptor and effector regulation
(summary by Michal et al., 2012).

CLONING

By PCR on neutrophil cDNA using primers based on sequences of known
receptor kinases, Haribabu and Snyderman (1993) identified GPRK5 and
GPRK6 (GRK6; 600869) sequences.

Using degenerate oligonucleotide primers to amplify GRK-conserved
sequences from a heart cDNA library, followed by screening the heart
cDNA library, Kunapuli and Benovic (1993) cloned GRK5. The deduced
590-amino acid protein has a predicted central protein kinase catalytic
domain and a calculated molecular mass of 67.7 kD. GRK5 shares 69% amino
acid identity with IT11 (GRK4; 137026) and is also closely related to
Drosophila Gprk2 and bovine rhodopsin kinase (GRK1; 180381). Northern
blot analysis detected a GRK5 transcript of about 3 kb that showed
highest expression in human heart, placenta, and lung, followed by
skeletal muscle, brain, liver, and pancreas, with little expression in
kidney.

By Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical analysis of human cell
lines, Michal et al. (2012) showed that GRK5 colocalized with
gamma-tubulin (see 191135), centrin (see 603187) and pericentrin (PCNT;
605925) at centrosomes and that it preferentially associated with the
mother centriole. In synchronized HeLa cells, GRK5 associated with
centrosomes predominantly during interphase and dispersed during
mitosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kunapuli and Benovic (1993) determined that the 5-prime UTR of GPRK5 is
relatively GC rich.

MAPPING

Bullrich et al. (1995) used a rodent-human hybrid panel to map 2 newly
identified members of the GRK family: GPRK5 and GPRK6 (600869) to
10q24-qter and 5q35, respectively. The hybrid cells containing parts of
chromosomes 10 and 5 were used for the regionalization.

GENE FUNCTION

Kunapuli and Benovic (1993) showed that GRK5 expressed in insect cells
phosphorylated rhodopsin (RHO; 180380) in a light-dependent manner.

Fan and Malik (2003) noted that desensitization of GPCRs regulates the
number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), as well as their motility
and ability to stop upon contact with pathogens or target cells, and
this desensitization is mediated by GRKs. They found that MIP2 (CXCL2;
139110) induces GRK2 (109635) and GRK5 expression in PMNs through PI3KG
(PIK3CG; 601232) signaling. However, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), acting
through TLR4 (603030) signaling, mediated through MEK1 (176872)/MEK2
(601263), transcriptionally downregulates expression of GRK2 and GRK5 in
response to MIP2, which decreases chemokine receptor desensitization and
markedly augments PMN migration. Therefore, LPS-activated TLR4 signaling
regulates PMN migration by modulating the expression of chemokine
receptors in a GRK2- and GRK5-dependent manner.

By depolymerizing microtubules, Michal et al. (2012) showed that
association of GRK5 with centrosomes in human cell lines was independent
of microtubules. Knockdown of GRK5 expression in HeLa cells induced G2/M
arrest or delay, which appeared to be due to increased expression of p53
(TP53; 191170), inhibition of AURKA (603072), and subsequent delay in
PLK1 (602098) activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Liggett et al. (2008) identified a leu41-to-gln (L41Q) polymorphism in
the GRK5 gene that was associated with decreased mortality in African
Americans with heart failure or cardiac ischemia. Studies in transfected
cells and transgenic mice showed that GRK5-L41 uncoupled
isoproterenol-stimulated responses more effectively than did GRK5-Q41
and protected against experimental catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy,
similarly to pharmacologic beta-blockade. In 375 prospectively followed
African American patients with heart failure, GRK5-L41 protected against
death or cardiac transplantation. Liggett et al. (2008) concluded that
enhanced beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization of excessive
catecholamine signaling by GRK-L41 provides a 'genetic beta-blockade'
that improves survival in African Americans with heart failure,
suggesting a reason for conflicting results of beta-blocker clinical
trials in that population.

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeted deletion, Gainetdinov et al. (1999) created Grk5-null mice.
Homozygous mutant mice were viable and showed no anatomic or behavioral
abnormalities compared with wildtype littermates. However, the core body
temperature of mutant mice was about 0.9 degrees C below normal. Since
the central cholinergic system is involved in thermoregulation,
Gainetdinov et al. (1999) challenged mutant mice with a nonselective
muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine. Mutant mice showed enhanced classical
cholinergic responses, such as hypothermia, hypoactivity, tremor, and
salivation. The antinociceptive effect of oxotremorine was potentiated
and prolonged, and muscarinic receptors in brains of Grk5-null mice
resisted oxotremorine-induced desensitization.

601906	TITLE *601906 WINGLESS-TYPE MMTV INTEGRATION SITE FAMILY, MEMBER 10B; WNT10B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Several members of the Wnt gene family have been shown to cause mammary
tumors in mice. Using degenerate primer PCR on human genomic DNA and
specific PCR of cDNA libraries, Bui et al. (1997) isolated a Wnt gene
that had not previously been described in human. It is the human homolog
of mouse Wnt10b, which had been shown to be one of the oncogenes
cooperating with FGF3 (164950) in the development of mouse mammary tumor
virus (MMTV)-induced mammary carcinomas in mice. The human WNT10B
sequence is 88% and 95% identical to the mouse gene at nucleotide and
amino acid levels, respectively. WNT10B expression was not observed in
normal and benign proliferations of human breast tissue but was found to
be elevated in 3 of 50 primary breast carcinomas. Southern blot analysis
of the carcinoma expressing the highest level of WNT10B showed no
amplification or rearrangement of the gene.

Hardiman et al. (1997) demonstrated that the WNT10B gene encodes a
389-amino acid protein with 96.6% sequence identity to mouse Wnt10b. The
expression pattern showed that it is synthesized in many adult tissues
with the highest levels found in heart and skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

By analyzing human genome draft sequence, Kirikoshi et al. (2001)
determined that WNT10B is encoded by 5 exons and is clustered with WNT1
(164820) in a head-to-head manner with an interval of less than 7 kb.
They hypothesized that the WNT1-WNT10B gene cluster and the WNT6
(604663)-WNT10A (606268) gene cluster on chromosome 2 might be due to
duplication of an ancestral WNT gene cluster.

MAPPING

By YAC and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping, Bui et al.
(1997) localized the WNT10B gene to 12q13, a chromosomal region
frequently rearranged in human tumors and also containing the WNT1 gene
(164820).

By PCR typing of a human/rodent monochromosomal panel and FISH, Hardiman
et al. (1997) mapped the WNT10B gene to chromosome 12q13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Ross et al. (2000) showed that WNT signaling, likely mediated by WNT10B,
is a molecular switch that governs adipogenesis. WNT signaling maintains
preadipocytes in an undifferentiated state through inhibition of the
adipogenic transcription factors CEBPA (116897) and PPAR-gamma (601487).
When WNT signaling in preadipocytes is prevented by overexpression of
axin (603816) or dominant-negative TCF4 (TCF7L2; 602228), these cells
differentiate into adipocytes. Disruption of WNT signaling also causes
transdifferentiation of myoblasts into adipocytes in vitro, highlighting
the importance of this pathway not only in adipocyte differentiation but
also in mesodermal cell fate determination.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a consanguineous Turkish family with SHFM mapping to chromosome
12q31.11-q13, originally reported by Gul and Oktenli (2002), Ugur and
Tolun (2008) analyzed the candidate gene WNT10B and identified
homozygosity for a missense mutation (R332W; 601906.0001) in all but the
most mildly affected individual; it was also found in homozygosity in 1
unaffected family member. Ugur and Tolun (2008) proposed that either a
second locus contributed to the phenotype or a suppressor locus
prevented trait manifestation in the nonpenetrant female. Linkage
analysis for the 5 known SHFM loci (see SHFM1, 183600) excluded 4 of
them; however, a rare insertion polymorphism (dbSNP rs34201045) at an
alternate promoter used for transcription of an N-terminal-truncated p63
isotype (see TP63, 603273) was detected in heterozygosity or
homozygosity in all but 1 affected individual.

In a 30-year-old pregnant Swiss woman with SHFM6, who presented for
genetic counseling, Blattner et al. (2010) identified a homozygous
truncating mutation in the WNT10B gene (601906.0001). Blattner et al.
(2010) emphasized that this patient, who presented with apparent
sporadic occurrence of the disorder and could have been presumed to have
a de novo dominant mutation, was found to be homozygous for the WNT10B
mutation, resulting in serious implications for genetic counseling.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPLIT-HAND/FOOT MALFORMATION 6
WNT10B, ARG332TRP

In affected members of a consanguineous Turkish family with
split-hand/foot malformation-6 (SHFM6; 225300), originally reported by
Gul and Oktenli (2002), Ugur and Tolun (2008) identified homozygosity
for a 994C-T transition in exon 5 of the WNT10B gene, resulting in an
arg332-to-trp (R332W) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
mutation, which was not detected in 200 controls, was not found in the
most mildly affected individual, a man with only cutaneous syndactyly of
the right hand; however, it was present in homozygosity in 1 unaffected
female family member. All but 1 affected individual also carried a TP63
(603273) promoter polymorphism, dbSNP rs34201045, in homozygosity or
heterozygosity.

.0002
SPLIT-HAND/FOOT MALFORMATION 6
WNT10B, 4-BP DUP, 458AGCA

In a 30-year-old pregnant Swiss woman with split-hand/foot
malformation-6 (SHFM6; 225300) who presented for genetic counseling,
Blattner et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 4-bp duplication
(458dupAGCA) in exon 4 of the WNT10B gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature truncation. Both unaffected parents and several other
unaffected family members were heterozygous for the mutation.
Consanguinity of the parents of the patient was not known. At 12 years
of age, based on radiographs, the malformation was described as
presenting with loss of second, third, and fourth toes of both feet,
bifid fifth toe on the right foot and fusion of the third and fourth
metatarsal of both feet. A surgical osteotomy of the fourth and fifth
metatarsal on the right foot was performed at 5 years. The right hand
impressed at birth with complete cutaneous syndactyly of the fourth and
fifth finger, hypoplasia of the third finger with loss of the distal
phalanx. The left hand showed proximal cutaneous syndactyly of the third
and fourth finger. Blattner et al. (2010) emphasized that this patient,
who presented with apparent sporadic occurrence of the disorder and
could have been presumed to have a de novo dominant mutation, was found
to be homozygous for the WNT10B mutation, resulting in serious
implications for genetic counseling.

601447	TITLE *601447 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 5; USP5
;;ISOPEPTIDASE T; ISOT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin (see 191339)-dependent proteolysis is a complex pathway of
protein metabolism implicated in such diverse cellular functions as
maintenance of chromatin structure, receptor function, and degradation
of abnormal proteins. A late step of the process involves disassembly of
the polyubiquitin chains on degraded proteins into ubiquitin monomers.
USP5 disassembles branched polyubiquitin chains by a sequential exo
mechanism, starting at the proximal end of the chain (Wilkinson et al.,
1995).

CLONING

Wilkinson et al. (1995) purified a 93-kD bovine protein with the
properties expected of a polyubiquitin disassembly protein. They
biochemically characterized the enzyme, which they called isopeptidase T
(ISOT), and cloned a cDNA encoding the human homolog (GenBank U35116).
The deduced 835-amino acid human polypeptide has a predicted molecular
mass of 93.3 kD.

Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) generated the genomic sequence of the human
CD4 gene (186940) and its neighboring region on chromosome 12 using the
large-scale shotgun sequencing strategy. A total of 117 kb of genomic
sequence and approximately 11 kb of cDNA sequence was obtained. They
identified in this sequence 8 genes, including CD4 and ISOT. Using a
battery of strategies, the exon/intron boundaries, splice variants, and
tissue expression patterns of the genes were determined. Tissue
expression analysis indicated a high level of expression of a 3.3-kb
ISOT transcript in brain, and a low level of expression in heart, lung,
spleen, and skeletal muscle. Sequence comparison showed that ISOT is a
member of the ubiquitin C-terminal hydroxylase family. Wilkinson et al.
(1995) originally cloned human ISOT and reported the sequence as 3,102
bp long. Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) stated that comparison of their cDNA
sequence with the sequence reported by Wilkinson et al. (1995) indicated
alternative splicing in exon 15. Four nucleotide differences were found
between the 2 sequences resulting in lys-to-arg and gly-to-asp
substitutions. The cDNA and genomic sequences were in full agreement.

Reyes-Turcu et al. (2006) stated that the 835-amino acid human USP5
protein contains 4 putative ubiquitin-binding domains: an N-terminal
zinc finger ubiquitin-binding domain (ZNF-UBP), a ubiquitin-specific
processing protease (UBP) domain formed by noncontiguous regions
containing the active-site cys and his boxes, and 2 ubiquitin-associated
domains (UBA1 and UBA2). UBA1 and UBA2 are located between the cys and
his boxes, which are in the central and C-terminal regions of USP5,
respectively.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Reyes-Turcu et al. (2006) reported the crystal structures of the ZNF-UBP
domain of USP5 alone and in complex with ubiquitin at 2.09-angstrom
resolution. They found that, unlike other ubiquitin-binding domains, the
ZNF-UBP domain contains a deep binding pocket where the C-terminal
diglycine motif of ubiquitin is inserted, thus explaining the
specificity of USP5 for an unmodified C terminus on the proximal subunit
of polyubiquitin. Mutation analysis showed that the ZNF-UBP domain was
required for optimal catalytic activation of USP5.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) mapped the USP5
gene to chromosome 12p13, near the CD4 gene (186940).

613939	TITLE *613939 SPERMATOGENESIS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 20; SPATA20
;;SPERM-SPECIFIC PROTEIN 411; SSP411
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shi et al. (2004) cloned rat Spata20, which they called Ssp411, and they
identified human SSP411 by database analysis. The deduced 787-amino acid
human protein shares 87% identity with rat Ssp411. SSP411 contains an
N-terminal CxxC thioredoxin (TXN; 187700)-like motif (CHWC) that is
conserved in human, mouse, and rat. Rat Ssp411 also has putative sites
for N- and O-glycosylation and phosphorylation. The N-terminal region of
rat Ssp411 was predicted to assume a thioredoxin fold with a potential
active-site disulfide bond between the cysteines of the CHWC motif.
Northern blot and semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses of rat tissues
detected Ssp411 in testis only, where it was expressed in spermatids,
but not in spermatocytes or spermatogonia. In situ hybridization of
adult rat testis detected Ssp411 in round spermatids and early elongated
spermatids. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Ssp411 protein
predominantly in elongated spermatids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shi et al. (2004) determined that the SPATA20 gene contains 16 exons and
spans 8.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Shi et al. (2004) mapped the SPATA20 gene
to chromosome 17. They mapped the mouse Spata20 gene to chromosome 11.

Hartz (2011) mapped the SPATA20 gene to chromosome 17q21.33 based on an
alignment of the SPATA20 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025000) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

164762	TITLE *164762 V-CRK AVIAN SARCOMA VIRUS CT10 ONCOGENE HOMOLOG; CRK
;;ONCOGENE CRK;;
CRKII
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The CRK oncogene was originally identified as a transforming component
of the avian sarcoma virus CT10. A cDNA encoding the chicken cellular
homolog of v-crk was isolated by Reichman et al. (1992) and shown to
consist primarily of the SRC (190090) homology domains SH2 and SH3.
Matsuda et al. (1992) isolated 2 distinct human CRK cDNA species and
showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of the corresponding
polypeptides differed in their C termini. The 2 cDNA species were
considered to derive from the same genomic locus by alternative
splicing.

MAPPING

Fioretos et al. (1993) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
the CRK gene to chromosome 17p13. Deletion of this region of chromosome
17 is one of the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities in human
cancer. The TP53 gene (191170) maps to 17p13.1; Fioretos et al. (1993)
mapped the CRK oncogene to 17p13.3, which is a second region on 17p that
has been shown to manifest frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in a
number of different tumor types. Thus, the region is presumed to harbor
a tumor suppressor gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Feller et al. (1994) described the SRC homology domains SH2 and SH3 as
molecular adhesives on many proteins involved in signal transduction.
They reviewed the interactions of ABL (189980) and CRK as a model of SH2
and SH3 interaction.

Hallock et al. (2010) found that Crk and Crkl (602007) were recruited to
mouse skeletal muscle synapses and played redundant roles in synaptic
differentiation. Crk and Crkl bound the same tyrosine-phosphorylated
sequences in Dok7 (610285), a protein that functions downstream of agrin
(AGRN; 103320) and muscle-specific receptor kinase (MUSK; 601296) in
synapse formation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cardoso et al. (2003) completed a physical and transcriptional map of
the 17p13.3 region from LIS1 to the telomere. Using Cardoso et al.
(2003), they mapped the deletion size in 19 children with ILS (607432),
11 children with Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS; 164762), and 4 children
with 17p13.3 deletions not involving LIS1. They showed that the critical
region that differentiates ILS from MDS at the molecular level can be
reduced to 400 kb. Using somatic cell hybrids from selected patients,
the authors identified 8 genes that are consistently deleted in patients
classified as having MDS. These genes include ABR (600365),
14-3-3-epsilon (605066), CRK, MYO1C (606538), SKIP (603055), PITPNA
(600174), SCARF1, RILP, PRP8 (607300), and SERPINF1 (172860). In
addition, deletion of the genes CRK and 14-3-3-epsilon delineates
patients with the most severe lissencephaly grade. On the basis of
recent functional data and the creation of a mouse model suggesting a
role for 14-3-3-epsilon in cortical development, Cardoso et al. (2003)
suggested that deletion of 1 or both of these genes in combination with
deletion of LIS1 may contribute to the more severe form of lissencephaly
seen only in patients with MDS.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hallock et al. (2010) found that knockout of both Crk and Crkl in mouse
skeletal muscle, but not of either gene alone, caused perinatal
lethality. Lungs from Crk- and Crkl-deficient newborns failed to expand.
Embryonic day-18.5 muscle from Crk- and Crkl-deficient mice lacked
innervation and showed severe defects in presynaptic and postsynaptic
differentiation.

602209	TITLE *602209 RAS-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN 1; RREB1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In several neuroendocrine cell types, the RAS/RAF signal transduction
cascade results in cell differentiation (see HRAS; 190020). This signal
transduction cascade involves inactivation of several tiers of protein
kinases, including members of the RAF (e.g., RAF1; 164760), MAPKK, and
MAPK families (see 176872). Ultimately, activation of these protein
kinases results in the activation of transcription factors responsible
for changes in cell phenotype. In the human medullary thyroid carcinoma
cell line TT, an activated HRAS oncogene or activation of the RAF1 gene
induces a program of neuroendocrine differentiation (Carson et al.,
1995). One of the hallmarks of this differentiation process is an
increase in the expression of the calcitonin gene (114130). Thiagalingam
et al. (1996) reported the DNA affinity cloning of a RAS-responsive
element binding protein, RREB1, from the TT cell line. RREB1, a zinc
finger transcription factor, was shown to bind specifically to the
distal RAS-responsive element (RRE) in the calcitonin gene promoter and
to augment the RAS/RAF-mediated transcriptional response of that
promoter. Thus, they concluded that it may be involved in
RAS/RAF-mediated cell differentiation.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a promoter pull-down assay followed by mass spectrometry analysis,
Flajollet et al. (2009) identified RREB1 as a protein that bound the
HLA-G (142871) promoter. RREB1 exerted repressive activity on the
promoter in HLA-G-negative cells that was mediated by recruitment of
HDAC1 (601241) and CTBP1 (602618) and/or CTBP2 (602619). CTBP1 and CTBP2
are subunits of the C-terminal binding protein (CTBP) complex, a
corepressor involved in chromatin remodeling. The HLA-G promoter
contains 3 RREB1 target sites. Flajollet et al. (2009) proposed that the
repressive activity of RREB1 on the HLA-G promoter may be regulated by
posttranslational modifications governing its association with CTBP.

MAPPING

Thiagalingam et al. (1997) mapped the RREB1 gene to 6p25 by 3 mapping
methods: PCR analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, analysis of the
Stanford G3 radiation hybrid mapping panel, and fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

605918	TITLE *605918 SPONDIN 2; SPON2
;;MINDIN;;
M-SPONDIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a differential display technique, Manda et al. (1999) isolated 2
novel cDNAs, SPON2 and C20ORF1 (605917), which they designated
differentially expressed in cancerous and noncancerous lung cells-1
(DIL1) and -2 (DIL2), respectively. The full-length SPON2 cDNA encodes a
331-amino acid protein with a domain organization similar to those of
zebrafish mindin-1/mindin-2 and F-spondin (SPON1; 604989): a hydrophobic
signal sequence in the N terminus, an FS1 domain, an FS2 domain, and a
thrombospondin type I repeat. RT-PCR analysis detected no expression of
SPON2 in lung carcinoma cells. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of a 1.9-kb SPON2 transcript in various tissues, including
adult and fetal lung.

He et al. (2004) cloned mouse Spon2, which they termed mindin. The mouse
mindin protein, which is 85% identical to the human protein, is a
conserved member of a family of secreted extracellular matrix proteins.
RNA blot analysis detected expression in a variety of tissues, with
abundant expression in lung and lymphoid tissues. Immunoblot blot
analysis showed expression of a 42-kD protein under reducing conditions
and expression of dimers and oligomers in a concentration-dependent
manner under nonreducing conditions.

GENE STRUCTURE

He et al. (2004) determined that the mouse Spon2 gene contains 6 exons
spanning 5 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SPON2
gene to chromosome 4p16.3 (TMAP WI-22263).

ANIMAL MODEL

By targeted replacement of part of exon 1 and all of exons 2 and 3 of
the Spon2 gene, He et al. (2004) generated Spon2-deficient mice. These
mice had a normal appearance and life span under pathogen-free
conditions. Spon2-deficient mice were resistant to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced shock, and their macrophages only produced slightly
elevated inflammatory cytokines. Addition of Spon2 to Spon2-deficient,
but not Tlr4 (603030)-deficient, macrophages restored their ability to
produce inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS. Stimuli from most
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast also failed to induce
cytokine responses from Spon2-deficient macrophages and mast cells.
Spon2-deficient mice showed variable clearance of pathogens when
inoculated by the pulmonary and intraperitoneal routes. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated Spon2-dependent bacterial agglutination in the
presence of calcium due to a specific interaction with the carbohydrate
moiety of LPS and lipoteichoic acid. Phagocytosis experiments indicated
that Spon2 acts as an opsonin and pattern-recognition molecule for a
range of pathogens. He et al. (2004) proposed that Spon2 recognition of
carbohydrate structures is essential for the activation of macrophages
by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).

610735	TITLE *610735 MYOZENIN 3; MYOZ3
;;CALSARCIN 3;;
FATZ-RELATED PROTEIN 3; FRP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by PCR of a human skeletal muscle cDNA
library, Frey and Olson (2002) cloned MYOZ3, which they called
calsarcin-3. The predicted 251-amino acid protein exhibits highest
homology to MYOZ1 (605603) and MYOZ2 (605602) at its N and C termini and
shares 75% identity with mouse Myoz3. Northern blot analysis of adult
human tissues revealed expression of a major 3.4-kb transcript, as well
as 2 other transcripts, in skeletal muscle only,

GENE FUNCTION

Frey and Olson (2002) showed that calsarcin-3 coimmunoprecipitated with
calcineurin (see 114105) and the Z disc proteins telethonin (TCAP;
604488), alpha-actinin-2 (ACTN2; 102573), and gamma-filamin (FLNC;
102565). Analysis of deletion mutants revealed 2 independent domains
that are sufficient to bind ACTN2, an N-terminal and a C-terminal
domain, with the former domain also required for calcineurin and
telethonin binding. A second N-terminal domain mediated binding to
gamma-filamin. By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, they showed that ZASP (LDB3;
605906) interacted strongly with all 3 calsarcins. Immunolocalization
experiments revealed a strong Z disc staining pattern in cryosections of
mouse hindlimb skeletal muscle, as indicated by colocalization with
alpha-actinin. Preferential expression of calsarcin-3 in fast-twitch
myofibers was observed using immunofluorescence. Frey and Olson (2002)
proposed that calsarcins may serve to crosslink Z disc proteins,
contributing to the formation and maintenance of the Z disc.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Frey and Olson (2002) mapped the MYOZ3
gene to chromosome 5q31.

GENE STRUCTURE

Frey and Olson (2002) determined that the MYOZ3 gene contains 7 exons
and spans approximately 19 kb.

188855	TITLE *188855 GRANULYSIN; GNLY
;;T-LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION GENE 519; TLA519;;
D2S69E;;
NKG5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GNLY gene encodes granulysin, a member of the saposin-like protein
(SAPLIP) family that is present in cytotoxic granules of cytolytic T
cells (CTSs) and natural killer (NK) cells and is released from the
granules upon antigen stimulation (Jongstra et al., 1987; Pena et al.,
1997).

CLONING

Jongstra et al. (1987) isolated 2 overlapping clones corresponding to
the GNLY gene, which they termed '519,' from a human functional
cytolytic T cell cDNA library. The deduced 129-residue protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 14.6 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a
900-bp mRNA that was also detected in functional T-helper cell lines,
but not in several T-cell tumor lines or other tissues. The findings
indicated that 519 expression is restricted to IL2 (147680)-dependent,
antigen-driven functional T cells. Expression of 519 was induced at
least 10-fold in peripheral blood lymphocytes by antigenic or mitogenic
stimulation.

Yabe et al. (1990) cloned GNLY, which they termed NKG5, from a natural
killer cell cDNA library. The deduced 145-residue protein began at a
start codon at position 129, with significant homology with the 519 gene
reported by Jongstra et al. (1987). A sequence comparison showed that
the 519 and NKG5 sequences were identical except that NKG5 lacks a
242-bp segment that is found in 519, and that this deletion leads to the
use of a different putative translational start codon and different
N-terminal regions. Unlike 519, the predicted NKG5 protein has a
putative N-terminal signal peptide, suggesting that it is a secreted
protein. In contrast, the 519 protein is hydrophilic and proposed to act
intracellularly. Northern blot analysis detected 40-fold higher
expression of the NKG5 transcript compared to 519 in NK and T cells.
Southern blot analysis indicated that both mRNAs are transcripts from a
single gene, consistent with alternative splicing. Yabe et al. (1990)
concluded that the 519 transcript results from a nonproductive splicing
event and does not encode a functional protein.

Houchins et al. (1993) identified many potential regulatory segments
within the 5-prime flanking region of the NKG5 gene, including AP1, AP2,
AP3, and SRE motifs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jongstra et al. (1987) identified 2 ATG translation initiation codons in
the 519 gene at positions 27 and 281: the latter at 281 was presumed to
be active, since the first ATG codon is followed by an in-frame stop
codon at position 69.

Houchins et al. (1993) determined that the GNLY gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Donlon et al. (1990) assigned the GNLY gene to
chromosome 2p12-q11.

GENE FUNCTION

Stenger et al. (1998) showed that granulysin is a critical effector
molecule of the antimicrobial activity of CTLs. Cytolytic T cells are
required for protective immunity against intracelluar pathogens such as
Listeria monocytogenes and Trypanosoma cruzi, which escape from
phagocytic vacuoles into the cytoplasm of infected host cells, as well
as Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, which are phagocytized by macrophages and remain localized
within phagosomes (Pena et al., 1997). An explanation for the functional
role of CTLs in immunity against intracellular infection was provided by
analysis of CTLs in tuberculosis (Kaufmann, 1988; Stenger et al., 1997).
These experiments suggested that CTLs that kill infected cells through
the granule-exocytosis pathway may release 1 or more effector molecules
with the capacity to kill the intracellular microbial pathogen directly.

Two subsets of CTLs exist, which differ in phenotype, cytotoxic effector
pathway, and antimicrobial activity. CD8+ CTLs lyse M.
tuberculosis-infected macrophages by a granule-dependent mechanism that
results in killing of the intracellular pathogen. In contrast, the
cytotoxicity of double negative CD4-/CD8- T cells is mediated by Fas-Fas
ligand interaction and does not inhibit growth of the mycobacteria. By
protein immunoblot analysis, Stenger et al. (1998) demonstrated the
presence of granulysin in CD8+ CTLs and the lack of granulysin
expression in CD4-/CD8- CTLs. Confocal microscopy of
granulysin-expressing cells showed a punctate pattern consistent with
granule localization. Furthermore, double staining of CD8+ T cells with
antibodies against granulysin and perforin (PRF1; 170280), a molecule
known to be expressed in cytotoxic granules, showed substantial
colocalization. Stenger et al. (1998) used recombinant granulysin to
test directly its antimicrobial activity against M. tuberculosis and
other organisms.

Chung et al. (2008) showed that blister cells from skin lesions from
patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermolysis
necrosis (TEN) (see 608579) primarily consisted of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes and natural killer cells, and that both blister fluids and
cells were cytotoxic. Gene expression profiling identified granulysin as
the most highly expressed cytotoxic molecule, confirmed by quantitative
PCR and immunohistochemistry. Depletion of granulysin reduced
cytotoxicity. In blister fluids, granulysin was in a 15-kD secretory
form, and injection of this form into mouse skin resulted in features
mimicking the skin necrosis. Chung et al. (2008) concluded that
secretory granulysin is a key molecule responsible for the disseminated
keratinocyte death in SJS/TEN. The findings also implicated a CTL- or NK
cell-mediated cytotoxicity that does not require direct cellular
contact.

604633	TITLE *604633 EGF-CONTAINING FIBULIN-LIKE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEIN 2; EFEMP2
;;FIBULIN 4; FBLN4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A large number of extracellular matrix proteins contain variations of
the epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530) domain, e.g., fibrillin (FBN1;
134797) and Notch (190198). As part of their efforts in transcriptional
mapping of the human 11q13.1-q13.2 genomic region, Katsanis et al.
(2000) identified a novel partial cDNA from a human brain cDNA library.
They called the cDNA 'EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix
protein-2' (EFEMP2) because of its significant homology to EFEMP1
(601548). Sequence analysis detected 6 putative calcium-binding EGF
domains and 4 EGF modules. Katsanis et al. (2000) observed expression of
a 2.0-kb EFEMP2 transcript in all adult tissues tested by Northern blot
analysis, with highest levels in heart. RT-PCR detected a 105-bp
amplicon from the 3-prime untranslated region in fetal brain, kidney,
and heart, but not in lung. EFEMP1 is likewise expressed in a wide range
of adult and fetal tissues. In contrast to EFEMP1, however, EFEMP2 was
not significantly overexpressed in senescent or quiescent fibroblasts,
suggesting a diversity of function within this EGF-like domain
subfamily. Katsanis et al. (2000) also cloned the mouse Efemp2 homolog.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by placement on a series
of genomic clones by PCR, Katsanis et al. (2000) mapped the EFEMP2 gene
to chromosome 11q13, in an area where several retinopathies have shown
genetic linkage.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Doyne Honeycomb Retinal Dystrophy

Given that EFEMP1 is the site of mutations causing Doyne honeycomb
retinal dystrophy (126600), Katsanis et al. (2000) suggested EFEMP2 as a
candidate for retinal dystrophies. Toto et al. (2002) studied linkage of
both the EFEMP2 and EFEMP1 genes to malattia leventinese in a
3-generation Swiss-Italian family. Linkage was found only to EFEMP1 in 2
of 5 affected family members.

- Autosomal Recessive Cutis Laxa

Cutis laxa is a condition characterized by redundant, pendulous, and
inelastic skin. A severe autosomal recessive form of cutis laxa (ARCL1A;
219100) is caused by mutation in the fibulin-5 gene (FBLN5; 604580).
Hucthagowder et al. (2006) hypothesized that mutations in other members
of the fibulin gene family may cause cutis laxa as well. In a child of
Iraqi descent with cutis laxa and severe systemic connective tissue
abnormalities (ARCL1B; 614437), Hucthagowder et al. (2006) detected a
homozygous missense mutation in the FBLN4 gene (604633.0001). The role
of fibulin-4 in elastic fiber formation is evolutionarily conserved in
mammals (McLaughlin et al., 2006); however, additional observations in
the patient of Hucthagowder et al. (2006) suggested that fibulin-4 may
have additional pleiotropic functions in vascular patterning and
collagen biosynthesis.

In an infant girl who died at day 27 of life with apparent
arachnodactyly, cutis laxa, and severe systemic vascular abnormalities
similar to those of the patient described by Hucthagowder et al. (2006),
and who was negative for mutation in the FBLN5 gene, Dasouki et al.
(2007) identified compound heterozygosity for a missense mutation and a
4-bp duplication in the FBLN4 gene (604633.0002 and 604633.0003,
respectively). Dasouki et al. (2007) concluded that deficiency in
fibulin-4 leads to a perinatal lethal condition associated with elastic
tissue abnormalities.

Hoyer et al. (2009) reported the third case of cutis laxa due to
mutation in FBLN4, an infant girl who died immediately after birth with
extreme bradycardia and who was found to be homozygous for a missense
mutation (604633.0004). Hoyer et al. (2009) stated that this case
extended the phenotypic spectrum of FBLN4 mutations to include
microcephaly, overgrowth, and arachnodactyly.

Renard et al. (2010) sequenced the FBLN4 gene in 17 patients with
prominent cutis laxa but no major cardiovascular findings, and detected
no mutations. Analysis of FBLN4 in a second cohort of 22 patients who
had mild skin involvement but significant cardiovascular features,
including arterial tortuosity, stenosis, and aneurysms, revealed
homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for mutations in the FBLN4 gene
in 3 patients (604633.0005-604633.0008). Renard et al. (2010) concluded
that patients with recessive FBLN4 mutations are predominantly
characterized by aortic aneurysms and arterial tortuosity and stenosis.
Immunostaining of aortic and lung tissue showed an increase in TGF-beta
(190180), which was confirmed by phosphorylated SMAD2 (601366)
immunoblotting of fibroblast cultures; Renard et al. (2010) stated that
this was the first evidence of involvement of altered TGFB signaling in
the pathogenesis of FBLN4 mutations in humans.

Kappanayil et al. (2012) reported 22 unrelated infants from the Malabar
region of the southern Indian state of Kerala. All were Muslims and came
from the community known as the Mappilas. Twenty-one of 22 were
homozygous for a missense mutation in exon 7 of FBLN4 (604633.0009). One
patient was compound heterozygous for this mutation and a second, de
novo, mutation (604633.0010) on her paternal chromosome. Both mutations
occurred in the same calcium-binding EGF domain of the protein. Neither
mutation was found among 200 control alleles.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IB
EFEMP2, GLU57LYS

In a child of nonconsanguineous parents of Iraqi descent with cutis laxa
(ARCL1B; 614437), Hucthagowder et al. (2006) found homozygosity for a
169G-A transition in the FBLN4 gene that resulted in a glu57-to-lys
(E57K) amino acid substitution. Each of her parents was heterozygous for
this mutation. Multiple alignments showed that the E57 residue was
completely conserved in calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)
modules, consistent with this residue being essential for calcium
binding. Hucthagowder et al. (2006) pointed out that the same
substitution at a homologous residue in fibulin-1, E1073K (134797.0038),
causes severe, neonatal Marfan syndrome.

.0002
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IB
EFEMP2, ARG279CYS

In an infant girl with cutis laxa, apparent arachnodactyly, and severe
systemic vascular abnormalities (ARCL1B; 614437), who died at day 27 of
life, Dasouki et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for an
835C-T transition in exon 8 of the EFEMP2 gene, resulting in an
arg279-to-cys (R279C) substitution at a highly conserved residue at the
end of the fifth cbEGF module, and a 4-bp duplication in exon 10
(1070dupCCGC; 604633.0003), predicted to truncate the protein and
replace the last 85 amino acids of the FC domain with an incorrect arg
residue. The missense mutation was not found in 50 controls. Analysis of
the patient's fibroblasts revealed that fibulin-4 protein was barely
detectable in culture medium and not seen in cell extract and matrix,
and immunostaining of patient fibroblasts showed a total absence of
fibulin-4 fibers from the extracellular matrix.

Renard et al. (2010) performed immunohistochemical staining of fibulin-4
on aortic tissue from the patient previously studied by Dasouki et al.
(2007) and confirmed the near absence of extracellular fibulin-4 in the
aortic wall compared to the control, whereas intracellular staining was
similar to that of the control, suggesting that the mutant protein is
either not secreted or is secreted into extracellular space to a lesser
extent. Immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated SMAD2 (601366)
and CTGF (121009), an effector of TGF-beta (190180) signaling and a
TGF-beta-driven gene product, respectively, in patient aorta and lungs
showed a more intense and increased nuclear staining compared to control
tissues.

EFEMP2, CYS267TYR

In an infant girl with cutis laxa (ARCL1B; 614437), born of
consanguineous Iraqi parents, Hoyer et al. (2009) identified
homozygosity for an 800G-A transition in exon 7 of the FBLN4 gene,
resulting in a cys267-to-tyr (C267Y) substitution involving the fifth of
six highly conserved residues in the fifth cbEGF module. The unaffected
parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

Renard et al. (2010) performed immunoblotting experiments on the culture
medium of dermal fibroblasts from the patient previously studied by
Hoyer et al. (2009), and observed a complete absence of fibulin-4.
Immunoblotting after TGF-beta (190180) stimulation of patient fibroblast
cultures indicated a significantly increased phosphorylated SMAD2
(601366) signal compared to controls, suggesting that mutation in FBLN4
has an effect on the TGFB signaling pathway.

EFEMP2, GLU126LYS

In a 20-year-old woman with velvety skin and severe arterial tortuosity,
aneurysm, and stenosis (ARCL1B; 614437), originally reported by Ades et
al. (1996), Renard et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 376G-A
transition in exon 5 of the EFEMP2 gene, resulting in a glu126-to-lys
(E126K) substitution at an evolutionarily conserved residue in the DINE
consensus sequence of the second cbEGF-like domain. The mutation was not
found in 200 control chromosomes. Immunoblotting experiments on dermal
fibroblast culture medium showed only a slightly diminished amount of
fibulin-4 compared to control, which the authors suggested was
consistent with the longer survival of the patient. In addition,
immunoblotting after TGF-beta (190180) stimulation of patient fibroblast
cultures indicated a significantly increased phosphorylated SMAD2
(601366) signal compared to controls, suggesting that mutation in FBLN4
has an effect on the TGFB signaling pathway.

CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IB
EFEMP2, GLU126VAL

In a female infant with arterial tortuosity and aneurysm (ARCL1B;
614437), who suffered a large hemispheric stroke at 5 weeks of age and
died at age 18 months from cardiorespiratory failure, Renard et al.
(2010) identified compound heterozygosity for a 377A-T transversion in
exon 5 of the EFEMP2 gene, resulting in a glu126-to-val (E126V)
substitution at an evolutionarily conserved residue in the DINE
consensus sequence of the second cbEGF-like domain, and a 1-bp deletion
(577delC) in exon 6, causing a frameshift predicted to result in a
premature termination codon (Q193Sfs*12). The unaffected parents were
each heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was present
in 200 control chromosomes. Clinical features in this patient included a
prominent forehead, mild hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures,
depressed nasal bridge, low-set and distorted external ears, and long
fingers. Echocardiogram showed severe dilation of the ascending aorta
and severe tortuosity of the entire aorta with hypoplasia of the
transverse aortic arch, proximal descending, thoracic, and abdominal
aorta. MRI showed severe tortuosity of the carotid and cerebral
arteries.

EFEMP2, ALA397THR

In a 7-year-old boy with arterial tortuosity, aneurysm, and joint laxity
(ARCL1B; 614437), originally reported by Baspinar et al. (2005), Renard
et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 1189G-A transition in exon
11 of the EFEMP2 gene, resulting in an ala397-to-thr (A397T)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the C-terminal
fibulin-like module. His unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation.

CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE 1B
EFEMP2, ASP203ALA

In 21 patients, 11 male and 10 female, with ARCL1B (614437), Kappanayil
et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for an A-to-C transversion at
nucleotide 608 in exon 7 of the EFEMP2 gene that resulted in an aspartic
acid-to-alanine substitution at codon 203 (D203A). All patients were
Muslims from the Mappila community of the Malabar region of the Indian
state of Kerala; 8 came from consanguineous families. All parents tested
were normal and carried this mutation in heterozygosity. Homozygosity
was lethal in 17 of the 21 patients, who died at a median age of 4
months. In another patient from the same community, Kappanayil et al.
(2012) detected compound heterozygosity for this mutation and a de novo
missense mutation (604633.0010).

.0010
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE 1B
EFEMP2, ARG227CYS

In 1 patient with ARCL1B (614437) from the Indian Mappila community,
Kappanayil et al. (2012) detected compound heterozygosity for an
asp203-to-ala mutation (D203A; 604633.0009) and a de novo C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 679 resulting in an arginine-to-cysteine
substitution at codon 227 (R227C). The mutation was found on the
paternal allele; paternity was proven. Both the D203A and R227C
mutations occurred in the same calcium-binding EGF domain of FBLN4.
While this patient had vascular abnormalities similar to those seen in
D203A homozygotes, the majority of whom died before the age of 4 months,
she remained asymptomatic at the age of 7 years.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A cascade of protease reactions is believed to be responsible for the
apoptotic changes observed in mammalian cells undergoing programmed cell
death. This cascade involves members of the aspartate-specific cysteine
proteases of the ICE/CED3 (147678) family, also known as the caspase
family.

CLONING

Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) identified the novel gene MCH5 when they
found a human EST sequence with significant homology to the newly
identified cysteine protease MCH4 (601762). They used PCR to clone a
cDNA of the MCH5 gene from a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. Sequence
analysis revealed that it encodes a polypeptide of 496 amino acids with
greatest homology to MCH4. The authors found that MCH4 and MCH5 both
contain the active site pentapeptide QACQG instead of the QACRG present
in all other known members of the family. Furthermore, the authors found
that the sequences of MCH4 and MCH5 contain Fas-associating protein with
death domain (FADD)-like domains, suggesting possible interaction with
FADD. Fernandes-Alnemri et al. (1996) stated that MCH5, like other
members of the ICE/CED3 family, forms an active protease only after
cleavage of its proenzyme into 2 subunits which dimerize to form the
active enzyme.

Using MORT1 (FADD; 602457) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a B-cell cDNA
library, Boldin et al. (1996) cloned several splice variants of CASP8,
which they called MACH. The isoforms could be divided into 2 main
subgroups. All isoforms share a common 182-amino acid N-terminal region,
including 2 MORT modules (i.e., death effector domains, or DEDs), but
they have different C termini. Subgroup alpha isoforms have C termini
containing a CED3/ICE homology domain that contains the catalytic site
and the substrate-binding pocket, while subgroup beta isoforms are
truncated and lack the CED3/ICE homology domain. The longest isoform,
MACH-alpha-1, encodes a deduced 479-amino acid protein. The CED3/ICE
domain of MACH-alpha-1 shares 41% and 34% identity with the homologous
regions in CPP32 (CASP3; 600636) and C. elegans CED3, respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected MACH transcripts ranging in size between
2.85 and 3.5 kb in all tissues examined, with highest levels in resting
peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and lowest levels in testis and
skeletal muscle.

Eckhart et al. (2001) identified several CASP8 splice variants that
preferentially use a distant splice donor site at the 3-prime end of
exon 8. Use of this distant site, which they called exon 8b, results in
mRNAs with truncated open reading frames. RT-PCR indicated equal
expression of both mRNA species in tonsil, spleen, bone marrow, thymus,
and lymph nodes. Peripheral blood leukocytes, heart, and epidermis
predominantly expressed mRNA containing exon 8b, as did a promyelocytic
cell line and a T-cell line. Liver and nearly all immortalized cell
lines, as well as primary endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and
keratinocytes, expressed mRNA lacking the 8b extension.

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorogenic peptide substrates corresponding to a sequence within
the nuclear protein PARP (173870), Boldin et al. (1996) confirmed that
MACH-alpha-1 is a thiol protease. By site-directed mutagenesis, they
identified cys360 as the catalytic cysteine. Using mutation analysis,
Boldin et al. (1996) determined that MACH binds to the N terminus of
MORT1. They also found that it self-associates, but it does not interact
directly with FAS/APO1 (TNRFSF6; 134637). Transfection of human
embryonic kidney cells and breast carcinoma cells with MACH-alpha-1 or
MACH-alpha-2 resulted in massive cell death.

Muzio et al. (1996) determined that CASP8, which they called FLICE,
interacts with wildtype FADD but not with FADD lacking the DED. They
also determined that granzyme B (GZMB; 123910) can remove the prodomain
and generate the active p20/p10 dimeric cysteine protease. Cleavage of
PARP by CASP8 resulted in the appearance of signature apoptotic
fragments. Transfection and overexpression of CASP8 in transfected
breast cancer cells resulted in apoptosis.

Expression of cDNAs that encode truncated polypeptides containing mostly
expanded polyglutamine repeats, but not of those that encode the
corresponding full-length proteins, has been shown to induce cell death
by apoptosis. Such truncated proteins have been shown to form aggregates
or inclusions (Ikeda et al., 1996). Sanchez et al. (1999) studied the
role of caspases in polyglutamine-induced cell death in established
cultures of primary cortical, striatal, and cerebellar neurons from
embryonic day 17 rat embryos, transfected with an expression construct
encoding truncated ataxin-3 that contained 79 glutamine (Q79) residues.
The authors showed that the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl2, CrmA, and a
truncated Fas/APO1-associated death domain protein (FADD DN) inhibited
polyglutamine repeat-induced neuronal cell death. A mutant Jurkat cell
line specifically lacking caspase-8 was resistant to
polyglutamine-induced cell death. Cells transfected with Q79 showed
insoluble inclusions. Caspase-8 was recruited and activated by these Q79
inclusions. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of activated
caspase-8 in the insoluble fraction of affected brain regions from
Huntington disease (143100) patients but not in those from controls. The
authors suggested that caspase-8 has an essential role in
Huntington-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Eckhart et al. (2001) found that different CASP8 isoforms were expressed
in resting and activated lymphocytes. Activation of lymphocytes shifted
the expression from mRNA species containing an exon 8b extension to
mRNAs that lack it. Differentiation in a promyelocytic cell line was
associated with the opposite shift, from mRNAs containing the shorter
exon 8 to mRNAs that include the exon 8b extension.

Gervais et al. (2002) found that HIP1 (601767) binds to the HIP1 protein
interactor (HIPPI; 606621), which has partial sequence homology to HIP1
and similar tissue and subcellular distribution. The availability of
free HIP1 is modulated by polyglutamine length within huntingtin
(613004), with disease-associated polyglutamine expansion favoring the
formation of proapoptotic HIPPI-HIP1 heterodimers. This heterodimer can
recruit procaspase-8 into a complex of HIPPI, HIP1, and procaspase-8,
and launch apoptosis through components of the extrinsic cell death
pathway. Gervais et al. (2002) proposed that huntingtin polyglutamine
expansion liberates HIP1 so that it can form a caspase-8 recruitment
complex with HIPPI, possibly contributing to neuronal death in
Huntington disease.

Yu et al. (2004) defined a novel molecular pathway in which activation
of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP; 603453), a serine-threonine
kinase, and Jun amino-terminal kinase (601158) induced cell death with
the morphology of autophagy. Autophagic death required the genes ATG7
(GSA7; 608760) and beclin-1 (604378) and was induced by caspase-8
inhibition. Yu et al. (2004) cautioned that clinical therapies involving
caspase inhibitors may arrest apoptosis but also have the unanticipated
effect of promoting autophagic cell death.

Poulaki et al. (2005) found that human retinoblastoma (RB1; 614041) cell
lines were resistant to death receptor (see DR5; 603612)-mediated
apoptosis because of a deficiency of CASP8 expression secondary to
epigenetic gene silencing by overmethylation. Treatment with a
demethylating agent restored CASP8 expression and sensitivity to
apoptosis.

Su et al. (2005) showed that caspase-8 deficiency (607271) in humans and
mice specifically abolishes activation of the transcription factor NF
kappa-B (164011) after stimulation through antigen receptors, Fc
receptors, or Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4; 603030) in T, B, and natural
killer cells. Caspase-8 also causes the alpha-beta complex of the
inhibitor of NF-kappa-B kinase (IKK; 600644 and 300248, respectively) to
associate with the upstream BCL10 (603517)-MALT1 (604860) adaptor
complex. Recruitment of the IKK-alpha,beta complex, its activation, and
the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa-B require enzyme activity of
full-length caspase-8. Su et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
explained the paradoxical association of defective apoptosis and
combined immunodeficiency in human caspase-8 deficiency.

Stupack et al. (2006) showed that suppression of caspase-8 expression
occurs during the establishment of neuroblastoma (256700) metastases in
vivo, and that reconstitution of caspase-8 expression in deficient
neuroblastoma cells suppressed their metastases. Caspase-8 status was
not a predictor of primary tumor growth; rather, caspase-8 selectively
potentiated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells invading the collagenous
stroma at the tumor margin. Apoptosis was initiated by unligated
integrins (see 605025) by means of a process known as integrin-mediated
death. Loss of caspase-8 or integrin rendered the cells refractory to
integrin-mediated death, allowed cellular survival in the stromal
microenvironment, and promoted metastases. Stupack et al. (2006)
concluded that these findings define caspase-8 as a metastasis
suppressor gene that, together with integrins, regulates the survival
and invasive capacity of neuroblastoma cells.

Oberst et al. (2011) showed that development of caspase-8-deficient mice
is completely rescued by ablation of receptor-interacting protein
kinase-3 (RIPK3; 605817). Adult animals lacking both caspase-8 and Ripk3
displayed a progressive lymphoaccumulative disease resembling that seen
with defects in Cd95 (FAS; 134637) or Cd95 ligand (FASL; 134638), and
resisted the lethal effects of Cd95 ligation in vivo. Oberst et al.
(2011) found that caspase-8 prevents RIPK3-dependent necrosis without
inducing apoptosis by functioning in a proteolytically active complex
with CFLAR (603599) and that this complex is required for the protective
function.

Kaiser et al. (2011) found that Ripk3 is responsible for the
midgestational death of Casp8-deficient embryos. Remarkably,
Casp8-null/Rip3-null-double mutant mice were viable and matured into
fertile adults with a full immune complement of myeloid and lymphoid
cell types. These mice seemed immunocompetent but developed
lymphadenopathy by 4 months of age marked by accumulation of abnormal T
cells in the periphery, a phenotype reminiscent of mice with Fas
deficiency. Thus, Kaiser et al. (2011) concluded that Casp8 contributes
to homeostatic control in the adult immune system; however, RIPK3 and
CASP8 are together completely dispensable for mammalian development.

Burguillos et al. (2011) showed that the orderly activation of caspase-8
and caspase-3/7 (600636/601761), known executioners of apoptotic cell
death, regulate microglia activation through a protein kinase C-delta
(PPKCD; 176977)-dependent pathway. Burguillos et al. (2011) found that
stimulation of microglia with various inflammogens activates caspase-8
and caspase-3/7 in microglia without triggering cell death in vitro and
in vivo. Knockdown or chemical inhibition of each of these caspases
hindered microglia activation and consequently reduced neurotoxicity.
The authors observed that these caspases are activated in microglia in
the ventral mesencephalon of Parkinson disease (168600) and the frontal
cortex of individuals with Alzheimer disease (104300). Burguillos et al.
(2011) concluded that caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 are involved in
regulating microglia activation, and suggested that inhibition of these
caspases could be neuroprotective by targeting the microglia rather than
the neurons themselves.

Gunther et al. (2011) demonstrated a critical role for caspase-8 in
regulating necroptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and
terminal ileitis. Mice with a conditional deletion of caspase-8 in the
intestinal epithelium (Casp8-delta-IEC) spontaneously developed
inflammatory lesions in the terminal ileum were highly susceptible to
colitis. These mice lacked Paneth cells and showed reduced numbers of
goblet cells, indicating dysregulated antimicrobial immune cell
functions of the intestinal epithelium. Casp8-delta-IEC mice showed
increased cell death in the Paneth cell area of small intestinal crypts.
Epithelial cell death was induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFA;
191160), was associated with increased expression of
receptor-interacting protein-3 (RIP3; 605817) and could be inhibited on
blockade of necroptosis. Lastly, Gunther et al. (2011) identified high
levels of RIP3 in human Paneth cells and increased necroptosis in the
terminal ileum of patients with Crohn disease, suggesting a potential
role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of this disease. Gunther et al.
(2011) concluded that their data demonstrated a critical function of
caspase-8 in regulating intestinal homeostasis and in protecting IECs
from TNFA-induced necroptotic cell death.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Varfolomeev et al. (1998) determined that
the CASP8 gene contains 8 exons. Hadano et al. (2001) determined that
the CASP8 gene contains 13 exons and spans 51.2 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Kischkel et al. (1998)
mapped the CASP8 gene to human chromosome 2q33-q34 and mouse chromosome
1B-proximal C. This mapping further extended the known homology of
synteny between these regions of human chromosome 2 and mouse chromosome
1. By FISH, Grenet et al. (1999) also mapped the CASP8 gene to 2q33-q34.
They noted that CASP10 (601762), whose product is closely related to
that of CASP8, has been mapped to the same location, indicating that the
2 genes have evolved by tandem duplication.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Liu et al. (2002) identified a naturally occurring deletion of leu62
within the first DED of CASP8 in A431 human vulva squamous carcinoma
cells. This deletion resulted in defective CASP8-dependent apoptosis.
Unlike wildtype CASP8, CASP8 lacking leu62 failed to form oligomers with
wildtype CASP8 and failed to interact with FADD. The mutation did not
effect proteolytic activation by granzyme B, nor did it effect catalytic
activity against PARP.

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous family with caspase-8
deficiency (607271), Chun et al. (2002) identified a homozygous mutation
in the CASP8 gene (601763.0001). The patients had defects in the
activation of T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which led to
immunodeficiency.

Soung et al. (2005) analyzed the entire coding region of the CASP8 gene
in 69 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC; 114550), 2 with low-grade
dysplastic nodule (LGDN), 2 with high-grade dysplastic nodule (HGDN),
and 65 without dysplastic nodules, and detected a total of 9 somatic
mutations (13%). All 9 mutations were an identical 2-bp deletion
(nucleotides 1225-1226; 601763.0002), which was predicted to result in
frameshift and premature termination of amino acid synthesis in the p10
protease subunit. The change was detected both in HCC and in LGDN
lesions, suggesting that CASP8 mutation may be involved in the early
stage of HCC carcinogenesis. Soung et al. (2005) found that expression
of the tumor-derived caspase-8 mutant in cells abolished cell death
activity of caspase-8.

Cox et al. (2007) reported the findings of the Breast Cancer Association
Consortium (BCAC), which had been established to conduct combined
case-control analyses with augmented statistical power to try to confirm
putative genetic associations with breast cancer. They genotyped 9 SNPs
for which there was some prior evidence of an association with breast
cancer (114480). They included data from 9 to 15 studies, comprising
11,391 to 18,290 cases and 14,753 to 22,670 controls. They found
evidence of a protective association with breast cancer for a D302H
polymorphism in CASP8 (601763.0003), and weaker evidence for an L10P SNP
in the TGFB1 gene (190180.0007). These results demonstrated that common
breast cancer susceptibility alleles with small effects on risk can be
identified, given sufficiently powerful studies.

Caspases are important in the life and death of immune cells and
therefore influence immune surveillance of malignancies. Sun et al.
(2007) tested whether genetic variants in CASP8, CASP10, (601762), and
CFLAR (603599), 3 genes important for death receptor-induced cell
killing residing in tandem order on chromosome 2q33, are associated with
cancer susceptibility. Using a haplotype-tagging SNP approach, they
identified a 6-nucleotide deletion (-652 6N del) variant in the CASP8
promoter (601763.0004) associated with decreased risk of lung cancer.
The deletion destroyed a binding site for stimulatory protein-1 (SP1;
189906) and decreased transcription. Biochemical analyses showed that T
lymphocytes with the deletion variant had lower caspase-8 activity and
activation-induced cell death upon stimulation with cancer cell
antigens. Case-control analyses of 4,995 individuals with cancer and
4,972 controls in a Chinese population showed that this genetic variant
is associated with reduced susceptibility to multiple cancers, including
lung, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers,
acting in an allele dose-dependent manner. The results supported the
hypothesis that genetic variants influencing immune status modify cancer
susceptibility. Haiman et al. (2008) did not find an association between
this SNP and breast (114480), colorectal (114500), or prostate (176807)
cancer among 2,098, 1,139, and 2,825 patients, respectively. The study
included patients in Hawaii and California of various ethnic groups.

ANIMAL MODEL

Varfolomeev et al. (1998) generated mice deficient in Casp8 by
disrupting exons 1 and 2, which encode the N-terminal death effector
domains (DEDs) that interact with MORT1/FADD. Whereas wildtype and
heterozygous mice appeared normal, no homozygous mutant mice survived
beyond approximately embryonic day 13.5. Histopathologic analysis
revealed marked abdominal hyperemia with erythrocytosis in the liver,
major blood vessels, capillaries, and other organs. Cardiac ventricular
musculature was thin and similar to early mesenchyme. Colony forming
assays showed that hemopoietic precursor cells were markedly reduced in
the mutant mice. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis indicated
that fibroblasts from mutant mice responded normally to the noncytocidal
effects of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR; 191190) and death
receptor-3 (DR3, or TNFRSF12; 603366) stimulation, whereas wildtype
fibroblasts were killed by TNF (191160) treatment or FAS cross-linking.
Agents such as ultraviolet irradiation and protein kinase inhibitors
were lethal for mutant and normal fibroblasts. Varfolomeev et al. (1998)
concluded that CASP8 is necessary for death induction by receptors of
the TNF/nerve growth factor (see NGFR; 162010) family and is vital in
embryonal development.

Zender et al. (2003) evaluated the efficacy of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) in vivo in different mouse models with acute liver failure. They
directed 21-nucleotide siRNAs against caspase-8, which is a key enzyme
in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Systemic administration of
caspase-8 siRNA resulted in inhibition of caspase-8 gene expression in
the liver, therefore preventing CD95-mediated apoptosis. Protection of
hepatocytes by caspase-8 siRNA significantly attenuated acute liver
damage induced by CD95 antibody or by adenovirus expressing FAS ligand.
In a clinical situation, siRNAs would most likely be administered after
the onset of acute liver failure. Therefore, Zender et al. (2003)
injected caspase-8 siRNA at a time during experimentally-induced liver
failure with already elevated liver transaminases. Improvement of
survival due to RNA interference was significant even when caspase-8
siRNA was applied during ongoing acute liver failure.

Salmena and Hakem (2005) used the Cre/lox recombinase system to generate
mice lacking Casp8 only in T cells (Tcasp8 -/- mice). Tcasp8 -/- mice
developed an age-dependent lethal lymphoproliferative and
lymphoinfiltrative immune disorder characterized by lymphoadenopathy,
splenomegaly, and T-cell infiltrates in lung, liver, and kidney.
Although there was lymphopenia in young Tcasp8 -/- mice, peripheral T
cells in old Tcasp8 -/- mice proliferated in the absence of infection or
stimulation. Salmena and Hakem (2005) proposed that Tcasp8 -/- mice may
serve as a model of human CASP8 deficiency and that CASP8 in T cells is
required for lymphocyte homeostasis.

To define the contribution of reduced caspase-8 to a wound healing
response, Lee et al. (2009) generated an epidermal knockout of
caspase-8. By postnatal day 10 the conditional knockout mouse had flaky
skin throughout its body, was slightly runted, and its epidermis was
dramatically thickened. Lee et al. (2009) found that even though
caspase-8 is normally expressed in the granular layer, it was the basal
and spinous layers that were markedly expanded in the knockout
epidermis. Lee et al. (2009) demonstrated that the loss of epidermal
caspase-8, an important mediator of apoptosis, recapitulated several
phases of a wound healing response in the mouse. The epidermal
hyperplasia in the caspase-8 null skin is the culmination of signals
exchanged between epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and
leukocytic cells. This reciprocal interaction is initiated by the
paracrine signaling of interleukin 1-alpha (IL1-alpha; 147760), which
activates both skin stem cell proliferation and cutaneous inflammation.
The noncanonical secretion of IL1-alpha is induced by a p38-MAPK
(600289)-mediated upregulation of NALP3 (606416), leading to
inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation. Notably, the increased
proliferation of basal keratinocytes is counterbalanced by the growth
arrest of suprabasal keratinocytes in the stratified epidermis by
IL1-alpha-dependent NF-kappa-B (see 164011) signaling. Lee et al. (2009)
concluded that their findings illustrated how the loss of caspase-8 can
affect more than programmed cell death to alter the local
microenvironment and elicit processes common to wound repair and many
neoplastic skin disorders.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CASPASE 8 DEFICIENCY
CASP8, ARG248TRP

In 2 affected sibs from a consanguineous family with caspase-8
deficiency (607271), Chun et al. (2002) identified a homozygous C-to-T
transition in the CASP8 gene, resulting in an arg248-to-trp (R248W)
substitution within the p18 protease subunit of the protein. The
asymptomatic mother, father, and sister were heterozygous carriers of
the mutation. In 13 extended family members, Chun et al. (2002)
identified 7 asymptomatic heterozygous carriers but found no additional
homozygous or immunodeficient individuals.

.0002
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, SOMATIC
CASP8, 2-BP DEL, 1225TG

In 9 unrelated patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (114550) and HBV
infection, Soung et al. (2005) identified the same somatic mutation, a
2-bp deletion (1225_1226delTG) in exon 7 that was predicted to result in
frameshift and premature termination of amino acid synthesis in the p10
protease subunit.

.0003
BREAST CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CASP8, ASP302HIS

MacPherson et al. (2004) and Frank et al. (2005) found evidence that the
presence of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CASP8 gene
resulting in an asp302-to-his (D302H) substitution (dbSNP rs1045485)
could reduce susceptibility to breast cancer (114480) in British and
German cohorts, respectively. Cox et al. (2007) found evidence for a
protective effect of the D302H polymorphism in an allele dose-dependent
manner in 16,423 cases and 17,109 controls from 14 studies that
contributed data to the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The
study achieved odds ratios of 0.89 and 0.74 for heterozygotes and rare
homozygotes, respectively, compared with common homozygotes. This site
was not found to be polymorphic in Korean, Han Chinese, or Japanese
women. Cox et al. (2007) noted that the functional consequences of the
aspartic acid-to-histidine substitution were not known, and further
experiments were required to establish whether D302H itself or another
variant in strong linkage disequilibrium with it is causative.

.0004
LUNG CANCER, PROTECTION AGAINST
CASP8, 6-BP DEL, NT-652

Sun et al. (2007) identified a 6-nucleotide insertion/deletion
polymorphism in the CASP8 promoter, -652 AGTAAG ins/del (dbSNP
rs3834129), the deletion variant of which was associated with decreased
risk of developing lung cancer (211980) in a population of Han Chinese
subjects. The -652 6N deletion was also associated with decreased risk
of cancer of various other forms including esophageal, gastric,
colorectal, cervical, and breast, acting in an allele dose-dependent
manner. The frequency of the -652 6N deletion was significantly lower in
individuals with lung cancer (P = 4.1 x 10(-5)).

Haiman et al. (2008) did not find an association between this SNP and
breast (114480), colorectal (114500), or prostate (176807) cancer among
2,098, 1,139, and 2,825 patients, respectively. The study included
patients in Hawaii and California of various ethnic groups.

605578	TITLE *605578 INTERFERON-INDUCED TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 2; IFITM2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 1-8 gene family, which includes IFITM1 (604456), IFITM2, and IFITM3
(605579), is highly inducible by both type I (IFNA (147660)/IFNB
(147640)) and type II (IFNG; 147570) interferons (summary by Lewin et
al., 1991).

CLONING

By screening a lymphoid cell cosmid library with a probe corresponding
to the 3-prime untranslated region of IFITM1, Lewin et al. (1991)
isolated a cosmid containing the IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 genes, which
they termed 9-27, 1-8D, and 1-8U, respectively, within a single 18-kb
fragment. The predicted 132-amino acid IFITM2 protein, which is
approximately 90% identical to IFITM3, has an N-terminal signal
sequence, 3 potential phosphorylation sites, and a C-terminal leucine
zipper. Sequence variability is greatest at the C terminus. Immunoblot
analysis showed that in response to IFNA, all 3 IFITMs were expressed as
14-kD proteins that could be further resolved by isoelectric focusing.

By whole-mount in situ hybridization, Lange et al. (2003) found that
expression of mouse fragilis, fragilis-2, and fragilis-3 was restricted
to the epiblast at embryonic days 5.5 and 6.5. By embryonic day 7.5, all
3 transcripts showed variable expression in a cluster of founder
premordial germ cells, and at embryonic days 11.5 and 12.5, all 3
transcripts were detected in gonadal germ cells. The 3 transcripts
showed unique patterns of expression in other tissues during mouse
development.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot analysis of cells expressing IFITM genes, Lewin et al.
(1991) showed that IFITM2 was not as responsive to IFNA treatment as
IFITM3 or IFITM1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lewin et al. (1991) determined that all the IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3
genes each contain 2 exons, with interferon-stimulated response elements
(ISREs) in the immediately 5-prime flanking sequence of the
promoter/enhancer region. Unlike IFITM1, which has an ISRE and 2 CCAAT
boxes but lacks a TATA box, IFITM2 and IFITM3 have 2 ISREs and no TATA
or CCAAT boxes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lange et al. (2003) mapped the IFITM2 gene
to an IFITM gene cluster on chromosome 11p15.5. The order of the genes,
from telomere to centromere, is IFITM5 (614757), IFITM2, IFITM1, and
IFITM3, and the cluster spans about 26.5 kb. Lange et al. (2003) stated
that IFITM2 maps to the plus strand and that all other IFITM genes map
to the minus strand. However, Gross (2012) determined that, in addition
to IFITM2, the IFITM1 gene maps to the plus strand based on an alignment
of the IFITM1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000897) with the genomic
sequence (GRCh37).

Lange et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Ifitm gene cluster to a region of
chromosome 7F5 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
11p15.5. The mouse Ifitm gene cluster contains 5 genes, whereas the
human cluster contains only 4 genes.

EVOLUTION

By phylogenetic analysis, Lange et al. (2003) found that only 2 mouse
fragilis genes, fragilis-4 (Ifitm5) and either fragilis (Ifitm3),
fragilis-2 (Ifitm1), or fragilis-3 (Ifitm2), have been conserved from
mouse to human. They suggested that subsequent gene duplications may
have occurred independently in both species.

190232	TITLE *190232 TRANSITION PROTEIN 2; TNP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

During mammalian spermiogenesis, histones are transiently replaced by
several low molecular weight, highly basic proteins called transition
proteins (TNPs), and finally by protamines, which are the principal
basic nuclear proteins of mature sperm. Four species of transition
proteins, Tnp1 through Tnp4, which facilitate chromatin transformation
from the nucleosome structure to the nucleoprotamine structure during
spermatid differentiation, were thought to occur in rat, ram, and boar.
Using cDNA probes for Tnp2 from these species, transcripts for human
TNP2 were not found in human testicular RNA or human testis cDNA
libraries. Finding homologous sequences in the human genome was greatly
facilitated, however, by the finding that, in the boar and bull genomes,
the genes for protamine-1 (PRM1, 182880) and Prm2 (182890) are clustered
with Tnp2. Schluter et al. (1992) tested a genomic human cosmid clone
containing the genes for both protamines and found that the TNP2 gene
was within a distance of 7.5 kb 3-prime of the PRM2 gene. The gene was
transcribed in human testicular RNA only at a level demonstrable by
RT-PCR and RNase protection assay. In contrast to the TNP2 genes of
mouse, rat, boar, and bull, the human TNP2 gene lacks the nucleotide
sequence GCCATCAC in its 3-prime UTR.

GENE FUNCTION

Pradeepa et al. (2008) showed that importin alpha-4 (KPNA3; 601892) was
required for active transport of Tnp2 into nuclei of rat testis germ
cells.

MAPPING

Schluter et al. (1992) determined that the TNP2 gene is clustered with
the PRM1 and PRM2 genes on chromosome 16p13.3. The 3 genes are arranged
in a DNA stretch of 13 kb, and these 3 genes are also closely linked in
boar and bull. From the restriction map of a cosmid clone, Engel et al.
(1992) concluded that the distance between PRM2 and TNP2 is about 7.5
kb. Engel et al. (1992) presented in situ hybridization data indicating
that the TNP2 gene is near the centromere of chromosome 16, in the same
area occupied by the mouse homologs of PRM1 and PRM2. Nelson and Krawetz
(1993) likewise showed from a study of a cosmid clone containing the
PRM1, PRM2 and TNP2 genes that they are closely clustered, with the TNP2
gene located 3-prime of the PRM2 gene at a distance of approximately 7
kb. A computer-assisted comparison of the sequences predicted that the
order of emergence of the 3 genes was similar to their spatial order:
PRM1-PRM2-TNP2. Presumably, the gene cluster arose from the PRM1 gene
through a series of gene duplication events.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhao et al. (2001) found that spermatogenesis in Tnp2-null mice was
almost normal, with testis weights and epididymal sperm counts
unaffected. The only abnormality in testicular histology was a slight
increase in sperm retention in stage IX to XI tubules. Epididymal sperm
from Tnp2-null mice showed an increase in tail abnormalities. Mutant
mice were fertile but produced small litters. In step-12 to -16
spermatid nuclei from Tnp2-null mice, there was normal displacement of
histones, a compensatory translationally regulated increase in Tnp1
levels, and elevated levels of precursor and partially processed forms
of Prm2. Electron microscopy revealed abnormal focal condensations of
chromatin in step-11 to -13 spermatids and progressive chromatin
condensation in later spermatids, but condensation was still incomplete
in epididymal sperm. Compared with wildtype, mutant sperm chromatin was
more accessible to intercalating dyes and more susceptible to acid
denaturation, suggesting DNA strand breaks. Zhao et al. (2001) concluded
that TNP2 is not critical for shaping sperm nuclei, histone
displacement, initiation of chromatin condensation, binding of
protamines to DNA, or fertility, but it is necessary to maintain normal
processing of Prm2 and, consequently, the completion of chromatin
condensation.

171500	TITLE *171500 ACID PHOSPHATASE 1, SOLUBLE; ACP1
;;PHOSPHATASE, ACID, OF ERYTHROCYTE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wo et al. (1992) cloned genes encoding 2 low molecular weight
phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatases from a human placenta cDNA library.
They were found to have identical nucleotide sequences, with the
exception of a 108-bp segment in the middle of the open reading frame.
From further studies they concluded that the 2 represent the fast and
slow electrophoretic forms of red cell acid phosphatase and that this
enzyme is not unique to the red cell but instead is expressed in all
human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Sensabaugh and Golden (1978) showed that ACP1 is inhibited by folic acid
and various folates, and that the inhibition is phenotype dependent:
ACP1(C) more than ACP1(A) more than ACP1(B). This explains elevation of
ACP levels in red cells of patients with megaloblastic anemia and also
variation in incidence and severity of favism (134700) in G6PD
(305900)-deficient persons.

Swallow et al. (1973) showed that 'red cell' acid phosphatase is not
limited to erythrocytes but can be demonstrated in other tissues,
including cultured fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cells where there is
no possibility of contamination by blood.

MAPPING

Weitkamp et al. (1969) presented data suggesting that the acid
phosphatase locus may be on chromosome 2. Renwick (1971) presented an
analysis of the Weitkamp data supporting assignment to chromosome 2.

Ferguson-Smith et al. (1973) presented deletion mapping evidence that
the acid phosphatase locus is on the distal end of the short arm of
chromosome 2, somewhere between 2p23 and 2pter. A child lacking this
segment was of phenotype B whereas the father and mother were homozygous
phenotype B and A, respectively.

Hulten et al. (1966) described a family in which studies of a reciprocal
translocation involving chromosome 2 suggested that the Kidd locus may
be on one of the involved chromosomes. Cell hybrid studies confirmed the
localization of acid phosphatase-1 on chromosome 2 (Povey et al., 1974).

Chu et al. (1975) presented cell-hybrid evidence for synteny of
gal-1-PT, acid phosphatase, MDH1 (154200), and gal-plus-activator (GLAT;
137030) and for assignment to chromosome 2. Junien et al. (1979)
assigned the ACP1 locus to 2p25.

Larson et al. (1982) studied 4 patients who had inherited an unbalanced
form of a familial reciprocal translocation, t(2;10)(p24;q26), giving
them partial duplication of 2p. Increased levels of acid phosphatase
indicated that ACP1 is located in the 2p24-2pter region and that MDH is
not. The previous inconsistency of the SRO (smallest region of overlap)
was now resolved; ACP1 is at 2p25.

By deletion mapping, Beemer et al. (1983) concluded that ACP1 is located
at 2p25 whereas MDH is closer to the centromere, i.e., in 2p25-p23. They
pointed to the report of Larson et al. (1982) as confirming their
findings.

Wakita et al. (1985) presented evidence in support of location of ACP1
at 2p25. In a patient with duplication of 2p25.3-p25.1, ACP activity was
1.4 times the mean value for normal persons.

Lothe et al. (1986) found that ACP1 is very closely linked (theta =
0.01) to a RFLP called D2S1 that maps to 2pter-p23. Siciliano et al.
(1987) and Thompson et al. (1987) resolved earlier ambiguity of the ACP1
assignment (2p23 or 2p25) by demonstrating in hybrid cells with
rearranged chromosomes that ACP1 is located at band 2p23, proximal to
MDH1 (154200). ACP1 is seemingly remote from APOB (107730); linkage
studies demonstrate no close linkage (Berg, 1987). There may be a large
amount of recombination in that region of 2p.

Wo et al. (1992) examined a human chromosome 2-specific library and
demonstrated that the sequences encoding 2 low molecular weight
phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatases that they were studying are located
on chromosome 2.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Bryson et al. (1995) mapped the
ACP1 gene to the distal portion of 2p25.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bryson et al. (1995) showed that ACP1 contains 7 exons spanning 18 kb
with a GC-rich promoter. Alternative splicing of exons 3 and 4 was shown
to account for 2 different isozymes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hopkinson et al. (1963) described a new human polymorphism involving
erythrocyte acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) as demonstrated in starch-gel
electrophoresis. Three alleles, P(a), P(b) and P(c), were thought to be
involved, their frequency being estimated to be 0.35, 0.60 and 0.05,
respectively. Another rare allele, P(r), was described by Giblett and
Scott (1965).

Dissing et al. (1991) concluded that 2 electrophoretically distinct
isozymes, f and s, which are produced in allele-specific ratios and are
associated with each of the 3 major alleles, are generated by
alternative splicing of the primary RNA transcript.

Mohrenweiser and Novotny (1982) described a low activity variant of ACP1
(GUA-1) that is frequent (gene frequency of 0.132) in Guaymi Indians of
Central America. This variant has an electrophoretic mobility similar to
the common B- and C-type variants, but individuals of the GUA-1
phenotype have a level of enzyme activity only 27% of the activity
expected for the ACP1C variant. Red cells of persons with the GUA-1
phenotype had increased basal levels of the flavoenzyme glutathione
reductase and a larger fraction of the glutathione reductase protein in
the form of the holoenzyme, indicating increased levels of flavin
adenine dinucleotide in the red cells of these persons. The finding was
consistent with the suggestion that ACP1 has a physiologic function as a
flavin mononucleotide phosphatase. This function could regulate the
intracellular concentrations of flavin coenzymes and, ultimately, of
flavoenzymes, and could be the mechanism for the association between
ACP1 type and certain disease states.

Miller et al. (1987) gave a general review of the electrophoretic
variants of red blood cell acid phosphatase. Arnaud et al. (1989)
identified in Czechoslovakia a rare variant of ACP1, called ACP1*KUK.
Arnaud et al. (1992) reported kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics
of the KUK variant.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

HISTORY

Van Cong and Moullec (1971) suggested that the acid phosphatase and
Lewis (111100) loci are linked, but Chautard-Freire-Maia (1974) could
not corroborate this linkage.

Mace and Robson (1974) and Weitkamp et al. (1975) presented data
consistent with loose linkage of red cell acid phosphatase and MNS blood
group (111300); these loci were later shown to be on separate
chromosomes (2 and 4, respectively). Mace and Robson (1974) found also a
hint of linkage between ACP and Kidd blood group (Jk; 111000); the Kidd
gene (SLC14A1; 613868) was subsequently shown to be on chromosome 18,
not 2.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ACID PHOSPHATASE 1, SOLUBLE, A/B POLYMORPHISM OF
ACP1, ARG105GLN

Dissing and Johnsen (1992) provided evidence for the molecular basis of
the 3 common alleles in Caucasians: ACP1*A, ACP1*B, and ACP1*C, which
give rise to 6 phenotypes (A, B, C, AB, AC, and BC). Each allele encodes
2 isozymes, f and s, which show fast and slow electrophoretic mobility,
respectively. The f and s isozymes are produced in allele-specific
ratios: 2:1 for Af and As, 4:1 for Bf and Bs, and 1:4 for Cf and Cs,
respectively. The f and s isozymes appear to be generated by alternative
splicing of exons in the primary RNA transcript. The coding portions of
the ACP1*B and ACP1*C alleles are identical; the only difference at the
protein level is the ratio of f and s isozyme. Thus, a difference in the
splicing mechanism presumably accounts for the difference in ratio. Af
and As differ from the Bf and Bs isozymes by a single substitution at
residue 105: arg and gln, respectively. These observations explain the
electrophoretic identity of the B and C isozyme pairs.

607242	TITLE *607242 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 2, ALPHA-2 SUBUNIT; AP2A2
;;KIAA0899
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing cDNA clones from size-fractionated human brain
cDNA libraries, Nagase et al. (1998) identified AP2A2, which they
designated KIAA0899. The deduced 929-amino acid protein shares more than
97% sequence identity with rat alpha-adaptin. By RT-PCR analysis
followed by ELISA for quantitation, they detected ubiquitous,
low-to-moderate expression of KIAA0899, with highest levels in spinal
cord and fetal and adult brain and lowest levels in spleen.

Using the N terminus of huntingtin (HTT; 613004) in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a testis cDNA library, Faber et al. (1998) identified AP2A2,
which they designated huntingtin yeast partner J (HYPJ). The predicted
protein shares significant sequence identity with mouse alpha-adaptin C.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the AP2A2 gene
to chromosome 11.

611853	TITLE *611853 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L48; MRPL48
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL48
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl48 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL48. They also identified MRPL48 homologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast, E. coli, or Arabidopsis.
Mouse and human MRPL48 share 81% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003) mapped the
MRPL48 gene to chromosome 11q13.2. They identified an MRPL48 pseudogene
on chromosome 6.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Interleukin-6 (147620), an important polypeptide hormone produced by
various cell types, plays a central role in a variety of biologic
phenomena. It modulates the immune response, is involved in the control
of body temperature, and in the liver regulates the synthesis of plasma
proteins, the 'acute phase' proteins. The IL6 receptor (IL6R; 147880)
consists of 2 chains, a ligand-binding chain and a glycoprotein
essential for transmembrane signaling which associates with the
ligand-binding chain only after binding of the ligand. Two different
IL6-responsive elements involved in the induction of acute phase
proteins (IL6REs) were identified, one in the promoter of the
haptoglobin and hemopexin genes and another in the promoter of the
alpha-2 macroglobulin gene. The haptoglobin and hemopexin gene IL6RE
sequence contains the recognition site for a family of nuclear proteins.
One of these proteins, IL6-dependent DNA-binding protein (IL6DBP), is
induced by IL6. It is identical to the liver-enriched transcriptional
activator protein of Descombes et al. (1990). This protein was found to
have a molecular weight of 32 kD and to stimulate transcription of
chimeric genes containing the albumin D-promoter elements both in vivo
and in vitro. LAP shared extensive sequence homology (71%) in its
DNA-binding and leucine zipper domains with CCAAT/enhancer-binding
protein (CEBPA; 116897). As a consequence, these 2 proteins show an
indistinguishable DNA-binding specificity and readily heterodimerize.
TCF5 is also identical to NF-IL6 (Akira et al., 1990). CEBPA and NF-IL6
(CEBPB, according to the nomenclature proposed by Cao et al., 1991) are
2 transcription factors belonging to a family of DNA-binding proteins
predominantly characterized by a leucine zipper motif that mediates
dimerization and a basic DNA binding domain. Notably, the CEBPA and
CEBPB genes contain no introns.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Although collagen is known to enhance hepatocyte differentiation and
hepatocytes produce collagen in vivo, the transcription factors
responsible for collagen type I gene expression in hepatic cells is not
known. Houglum et al. (1994) showed that LAP binds to the COL1A1
(120150) promoter at both reverse CCAAT motifs and activates
transcription. Furthermore, they found an upstream element, collagen
element I (-370/-344), which shares homology with the LAP binding
cis-element of the albumin promoter (9 of 13 bp). This collagen element
I stimulates transcription in both orientations and when placed in front
of either a homologous or a heterologous chimeric report construct.
Thus, LAP may be important in the expression of collagen and
differentiated hepatocytes through both the promoter and the newly
described upstream element.

Hormonal induction of growth-arrested 3T3-L1 preadipocytes rapidly
activates expression of CEBPB. Acquisition of DNA-binding activity by
CEBPB, however, is delayed until the cells synchronously enter the S
phase of mitotic clonal expansion (MCE). After MCE, CEBPB activates
expression of CEBPA and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
(PPARG; 601487), which then transcriptionally activate genes that give
rise to the adipocyte phenotype. Zhang et al. (2004) studied the effect
on adipogenesis of the CEBPB dominant-negative mutation that blocks
CEBPB DNA binding by dimerizing with its leucine zipper. They provided
evidence that the dominant-negative mutant prevented entry of CEBPB into
the nucleus of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and thereby blocks MCE and
adipogenesis.

GENE FUNCTION

Menard et al. (2002) showed that Cebpb was expressed in mouse cortical
progenitor cells and could induce expression of a reporter gene
containing the minimal promoter of alpha-tubulin (TUBA1A; 602529), a
neuron-specific gene. Gel and supershift assays confirmed that Cebpb
bound the alpha-tubulin promoter in embryonic mouse brain. Menard et al.
(2002) also showed that Cebpb was a downstream target of Mek (see
176872), which activated Rsk (see 601684) to phosphorylate Cebpb.

By computational analysis of the expression patterns of thousands of
genes across hundreds of tumor specimens, Lamb et al. (2003) found that
CEBP-beta participates in the consequences of cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461)
overexpression. Functional analysis confirmed the involvement of CEBPB
in the regulation of genes affected by cyclin D1 and established CEBPB
as a principal effector of cyclin D1 activity in human cancer.

By expression profiling of ALK (105590)-positive anaplastic large cell
lymphomas (ALCLs), Piva et al. (2006) identified a large group of
ALK-regulated genes. Functional RNA interference screening on a set of
these transcriptional targets revealed that CEBPB and BCL2A1 (601056)
were absolutely necessary to induce cell transformation and/or to
sustain growth and survival of ALK-positive ALCL cells.

Dudaronek et al. (2007) showed that Ifnb (147720) induced expression of
Lip, a truncated, dominant-negative isoform of Cebpb, and suppressed
active simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication in macaque
macrophages. In a human monocyte cell line, IFNB induced phosphorylation
of CUGBP1 (601074) and formation of CUGBP1-CEBPB mRNA complexes.
Depletion of Cugbp1 in macaque macrophages via small interfering RNA
showed that Cugbp1 was required for Ifnb-mediated induction of Lip and
for Ifnb-mediated suppression of SIV replication. Dudaronek et al.
(2007) concluded that CUGBP1 is a downstream effector of IFNB signaling
in primary macrophages that plays an important role in innate immune
responses controlling acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or SIV
replication in brain.

Using a cDNA complementation screen, Kinoshita and Taguchi (2008)
identified NFIL6 as a host molecule that rendered primary CD4
(186940)-positive T cells permissive for HIV-1 replication. They found
that NFIL6 regulated HIV-1 replication during reverse transcription
after infection by binding to and inactivating the cytidine deaminase
activity of APOBEC3G (607113) and also during gene transcription after
integration. Binding and inactivation of APOBEC3G required ser288 in
NFIL6. Overexpression of NFIL6 in nonpermissive cells enhanced HIV-1
replication, even in the absence of the HIV-1 protein Vif. Kinoshita and
Taguchi (2008) proposed that NFIL6 evolved to negatively regulate
APOBEC3G to limit DNA mutations, but that this mechanism backfires
during HIV-1 infection, where it facilitates viral reverse transcription
and replication.

Ishikawa et al. (2008) demonstrated that cAMP-induced binding of
CEBP-beta to multiple motifs in the CYP19A1 (107910) promoter I.3/II
region is a critical mechanism regulating aromatase expression in
leiomyoma (see 150699) smooth muscle cells in primary culture. The
authors concluded that definition of this mechanism further may assist
in designing inhibitors of aromatase specific for leiomyoma tissue.

Kajimura et al. (2009) demonstrated that PRDM16 (605557) forms a
transcriptional complex with the active form of C/EBP-beta, acting as a
critical molecular unit that controls the cell fate switch from
myoblastic precursors to brown fat cells. Forced expression of PRDM16
and C/CEBP-beta was sufficient to induce a fully functional brown fat
program in naive fibroblastic cells, including skin fibroblasts from
mouse and man. Transplantation of fibroblasts expressing these 2 factors
into mice gave rise to an ectopic fat pad with the morphologic and
biochemical characteristics of brown fat. Like endogenous brown fat,
this synthetic brown fat tissue acted as a sink for glucose uptake, as
determined by positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose.
Kajimura et al. (2009) concluded that the PRMD16-C/EBP-beta complex
initiates brown fat formation from myoblastic precursors and may provide
opportunities for the development of therapeutics for obesity and type 2
diabetes.

Carro et al. (2010) used reverse engineering and an unbiased
interrogation of a glioma-specific regulatory network to reveal the
transcriptional module that activates expression of mesenchymal genes in
malignant glioma. Two transcription factors, C/EBP-beta and STAT3
(102582), emerged as synergistic initiators and master regulators of
mesenchymal transformation. Ectopic coexpression of C/EBP-beta and STAT3
reprogrammed neural stem cells along the aberrant mesenchymal lineage,
whereas elimination of the 2 factors in glioma cells led to collapse of
the mesenchymal signature and reduced tumor aggressiveness. In human
glioma, expression of C/EBP-beta and STAT3 correlated with mesenchymal
differentiation and predicted poor clinical outcome. Carro et al. (2010)
concluded that the activation of a small regulatory module is necessary
and sufficient to initiate and maintain an aberrant phenotypic state in
cancer cells.

Bostrom et al. (2010) found that expression of Cebpb in mice was
significantly downregulated during cardiac hypertrophy induced by
exercise endurance training, but not during pathologic cardiac
hypertrophy. Knockdown of Cebpb by small interfering RNA in primary rat
cardiomyocytes increased cell size, the rate of protein synthesis, and
cell number. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that Cebpb interacted
with Srf (600589), and knockdown of Cebpb increased binding of Srf to
the promoters of the critical cardiac genes alpha-MHC (MYH6; 160710) and
Gata4 (600576). Expression of Cited4 (606815) increased robustly in
exercised hearts, and its expression level was altered by Cebpb gain or
loss of function in vitro. Knockdown of Cited4 completely abolished the
effect of Cebpb reduction on cardiomyocyte proliferation.

Overexpression of P-cadherin (CDH3; 114021) has been associated with
proliferative lesions of high histologic grade, decreased cell polarity,
and poor survival of patients with breast cancer. In vitro studies
showed that it can be upregulated by the antiestrogen drug ICI 182,780,
suggesting that the lack of estrogen receptor-alpha (ESRA; 133430)
signaling may responsible for the aberrant P-cadherin overexpression and
for its role in inducing breast cancer cell invasion and migration.
Albergaria et al. (2010) showed that ICI 182,780 was able to increase
P-cadherin promoter activity, inducing high levels of the active
chromatin marker H3 lysine-4 dimethylation (H3K4me2). Albergaria et al.
(2010) also showed that CEBPB was able to upregulate P-cadherin promoter
activity in breast cancer cells. Moreover, the expression of P-cadherin
and CEBPB were highly associated in human breast carcinomas and linked
with a worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. The authors concluded
that epigenetic upregulation of P-cadherin by ICI 182,780 in MCF-7/AZ
breast cancer cells occurs through chromatin remodeling at the CDH3
promoter, bringing forward the growing evidence that ESRA signaling
abrogation by antiestrogens may be able to induce the expression of
ESRA-repressed genes which, in the appropriate cell biology context, may
contribute to a breast cancer cell invasion phenotype.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/mouse somatic cell hybrids, Szpirer et al. (1991)
assigned the TCF5 gene to human chromosome 20. By corresponding studies
in rat/mouse hybrids, they localized the gene to rat chromosome 3.
Hendricks-Taylor et al. (1992) mapped the human CEBPB gene to chromosome
20 by Southern blot analysis of Chinese hamster/human and mouse/human
somatic cell hybrids and regionalized the gene to 20q13.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Using interspecific backcross
analysis, Jenkins et al. (1995) showed that the Cebpb gene maps to mouse
chromosome 2.

EVOLUTION

Lynch et al. (2011) showed that amino acid changes in the transcription
factor CEBPB in the stem lineage of placental mammals changed the way it
responds to cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911) signaling. By
functionally analyzing resurrected ancestral proteins, they identified 3
amino acid substitutions in an internal regulatory domain of CEBPB that
are responsible for the novel function. These amino acid substitutions
reorganize the location of key phosphorylation sites, introducing a new
site and removing 2 ancestral sites, reversing the response of CEBPB to
GSK-3-beta (605004)-mediated phosphorylation from repression to
activation. Lynch et al. (2011) concluded that changing the response of
transcription factors to signaling pathways can be an important
mechanism of gene regulatory evolution.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine the role of C/EBP-beta in the regenerating liver, Greenbaum
et al. (1998) examined the regenerative response after partial
hepatectomy in mice that had a targeted disruption of the gene.
Posthepatectomy, hepatocyte DNA synthesis was decreased to 25% of normal
in the homozygous deficient mice. The reduced regenerative response was
associated with a prolonged period of hypoglycemia that was independent
of expression of C/EBP-alpha protein and gluconeogenic genes. The
homozygous C/EBP-beta-deficient livers showed reduced expression of
immediate-early growth-control genes. This study demonstrated that C/EBP
is required for a normal proliferative response.

Wang et al. (2000) performed detailed biochemical experiments on
CEBPB-deficient mice. They found that the deletion caused decreased
plasma free fatty acid levels and increased insulin signal transduction,
specifically in skeletal muscle, and that both contribute to increased
whole-body insulin sensitivity.

Croniger et al. (2001) noted that there are 2 distinct phenotypes, A and
B, in Cebpb-deficient mice. Phenotype A mice survive to adulthood but
have hypoglycemia as well as lipid, amino acid, and immunologic
deficiencies. Phenotype B mice survive only 2 hours after birth and
display profound hypoglycemia in spite of above normal levels of hepatic
glycogen. Croniger et al. (2001) detailed the metabolic consequences in
Cebpb-deficient mice. In these mice, relatively small changes in the
rate of hepatic cAMP degradation and a shift in the pattern of protein
kinase A (PKA; see 176911) isoform gene expression result in a lower
concentration of cAMP in the liver. More cAMP is required to activate
PKA, and the result is a failure of the normal response to glucagon.

Upon activation by liver injury, hepatic stellate cells produce
excessive fibrous tissue leading to cirrhosis. Buck et al. (2001) found
that the hepatotoxin CCl4 induced activation of Rsk (601684),
phosphorylation of Cebpb on thr217 (Cebpb-Pthr217), and proliferation of
stellate cells in normal mice, but it caused apoptosis of these cells in
Cebpb -/- or Cebpb-ala217 (a dominant-negative nonphosphorylatable
mutant) transgenic mice. Both Cebpb-Pthr217 and the phosphorylation
mimicked Cebpb-glu217, but not Cebpb-ala217; were associated with
procaspase-1 (147678) and -8 (601763) in vivo and in vitro; and
inhibited activation of these procaspases. These data suggested that
Cebpb phosphorylation on thr217 creates a functional XEXD caspase
substrate/inhibitor box (K-phospho-T(217)VD) that is mimicked by
Cebpb-glu217 (KE(217)VD). Cebpb -/- and Cebpb-ala217 stellate cells were
rescued from apoptosis by the cell-permeant KE(217)VD tetrapeptide or
Cebpb-glu217.

A surge of luteinizing hormone (LH; see 152780) from the pituitary gland
triggers ovulation, oocyte maturation, and luteinization for successful
reproduction in mammals. Because the signaling molecules RAS (190020)
and ERK1/2 (see 601795) are activated by an LH surge in granulosa cells
of preovulatory follicles, Fan et al. (2009) disrupted Erk1/2 in mouse
granulosa cells and provided in vivo evidence that these kinases are
necessary for LH-induced oocyte resumption of meiosis, ovulation, and
luteinization. In addition, biochemical analyses and selected disruption
of the Cebpb gene in granulosa cells demonstrated that C/EBP-beta is a
critical downstream mediator of ERK1/2 activation. Thus, Fan et al.
(2009) concluded that ERK1/2 and C/EBP-beta constitute an in vivo
LH-regulated signaling pathway that controls ovulation- and
luteinization-related events.

Bostrom et al. (2010) stated that homozygous Cebpb deletion in mice
results in pre- and perinatal lethality, but that Cebpb +/- mice are
relatively normal. They found increased heart weight and cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy in Cebpb +/- mice, similar to that found in wildtype mice
following endurance training. Cebpb +/- mice displayed a clear increase
in exercise capacity at baseline, but no hypertrophy following training.
Cultured cardiomyocytes from Cebpb +/- mice proliferated more readily
than wildtype cardiomyocytes. Cebpb +/- mice also showed resistance to
pathologic cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction caused by pressure
overload. Knockdown of Cebpb in zebrafish caused an increase in
cardiomyocyte cell number, but no change in cardiomyocyte size. Bostrom
et al. (2010) concluded that reduced CEBPB activity during exercise
contributes to physiologic cardiac hypertrophy.

607001	TITLE *607001 EUCHROMATIC HISTONE METHYLTRANSFERASE 1; EHMT1
;;EUHMTASE1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ogawa et al. (2002) identified the components of the E2F6 (602944)
complex, which represses transcription. Although histone acetylase and
deacetylase activities were not detected in the E2F6 complex,
methyltransferase activity was. Ogawa et al. (2002) identified
euchromatic histone methyltransferase-1 as a component of the E2F6
complex. The 1,267-amino acid EU-HMTase-1 protein contains ankyrin
repeats and a SET domain. EU-HMTase-1 shares 63% sequence similarity
with NG36/G9A (604599). EU-HMTase-1 exhibited histone methyltransferase
activity with a specificity for histone H3 in core histones, whereas it
hardly methylated nucleosomes, suggesting that other subunits in the
E2F6 complex are required for modification of nucleosomal substrates.
Ogawa et al. (2002) demonstrated that lysine-9 of histone H3 is the
target of euchromatic histone methyltransferase-1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kleefstra et al. (2006) stated that the EHMT1 gene contains 28 exons.
The initiation ATG occurs in exon 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The chromosome 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome, or Kleefstra syndrome
(610253), is a mental retardation syndrome that was thought to be caused
by small interstitial deletions in the 9q subtelomeric region. Kleefstra
et al. (2005) characterized the breakpoints in a female with a balanced
translocation t(X;9)(p11.23;q34.3) and found that the chromosome
breakpoint disrupted the EHMT1 gene in intron 9. The patient presented
typical features of 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome, which suggested
that the core phenotype of this entity is due to haploinsufficiency of
EHMT1. Kleefstra et al. (2006) performed a comprehensive mutation
analysis of the EHMT1 gene in 23 patients with clinical presentations
consistent with 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome. Three patients had
microdeletions that comprised the EHMT1 gene; 1 interstitial deletion
reduced the critical region for this syndrome. Two patients had de novo
mutations, a nonsense mutation and a frameshift mutation, in the EHMT1
gene (607001.0001-607001.0002). These results appeared to establish that
haploinsufficiency of EHMT1 is causative for the 9q subtelomeric
deletion syndrome.

In 6 of 24 patients with a clinical phenotype consistent with 9q
deletion syndrome who had normal chromosome studies, Kleefstra et al.
(2009) identified 6 different intragenic mutations in the EHMT1 gene
(see, e.g., C1042Y, 607001.0003 and R260X, 607001.0004). There were 2
nonsense mutations, a deletion, 2 splice site mutations, and 1 missense
mutation in a highly conserved residue. A comparison of the phenotype
between these 6 patients and 16 additional patients with larger
deletions of 9q showed no genotype/phenotype correlations. Kleefstra et
al. (2009) concluded that haploinsufficiency for EHMT1 is the basis for
the phenotypic features in this disorder.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schaefer et al. (2009) found that conditional ablation of Ehmt2 (604599)
or Ehmt1 in postnatal mouse forebrain neurons caused a reduction in
euchromatic H3K9 methylation in the forebrain and
upregulation/derepression of neuronal and nonneuronal genes (e.g., AFP;
104150), including those involved in developmental stage-dependent gene
expression (e.g., Dach2; 300608). These changes were not associated with
alterations in neuronal architecture or electrophysiologic features.
Mice with postnatal knockout of Ehmt1 or Ehmt2 in the forebrain showed
decreased exploratory behavior in a novel environment and had a decrease
in the preference for sucrose solution compared to wildtype mice, the
latter of which may indicate an underlying dysfunction in
motivation/reward. Both Ehmt2-null and Ehmt1-null mice became obese.
Ehmt1-null mice also showed defects in contextual and cued fear
conditioning, indicating a problem with learning and memory. Mice
lacking Ehmt2 specifically in Drd1 (126449)- or Drd2 (126450)-expressing
neurons in the striatum showed altered locomotor and behavioral
responses to Drd-specific receptor agonist or antagonists, reflecting
reductions of cell type-specific activity. The changes in these mice
resembled the features of the human chromosome 9q34.3 deletion syndrome.
Schaefer et al. (2009) concluded that Ehmt1 and Ehmt2 are key regulators
of cognition and adaptive behavior in adult mice through regulation of
transcriptional homeostasis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME
EHMT1, ARG1137TER

In a patient with clinical features of the 9q subtelomeric deletion
syndrome (610253), Kleefstra et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous
3409C-T transition in exon 24 of the EHMT1 gene that caused an
arg1137-to-stop substitution (R1137X).

.0002
KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME
EHMT1, 13-BP DEL

In a patient with clinical features of the 9q subtelomeric deletion
syndrome (610253), Kleefstra et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous
13-bp deletion in exon 8 of the EHMT1 gene (1320_1332del13). The
deletion resulted in a frameshift (P442fs) and a premature stop that
predicted a mutant protein of 526 amino acids.

.0003
KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME
EHMT1, CYS1042TYR

In a 20-year-old woman with a phenotype consistent with chromosome 9q
subtelomeric deletion syndrome (610253), Kleefstra et al. (2009)
identified a de novo heterozygous 3125G-A transition in the EHMT1 gene,
resulting in a cys1042-to-tyr (C1042Y) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the pre-SET domain of the protein. Protein modeling
predicted that the substitution would abolish a strong cysteine-zinc
interaction and interfere with the local conformation of the pre-SET
domain. The phenotype was fully compatible with the deletion syndrome,
and included severe psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, and
characteristic facial features of midface hypoplasia, synophrys, and
eversion of the lower lip. She also had pulmonary stenosis. Kleefstra et
al. (2009) postulated loss of protein function and haploinsufficiency
rather than a dominant-negative effect.

.0004
KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME
EHMT1, ARG260TER

In a 19-year-old man with a phenotype consistent with chromosome 9q
subtelomeric deletion syndrome (610253), Kleefstra et al. (2009)
identified a de novo heterozygous 778C-T transition in the EHMT1 gene,
resulting in an arg260-to-ter (R260X) substitution, predicted to result
in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The man had mental retardation,
seizures, and characteristic facial abnormalities.

604158	TITLE *604158 SECRETED FRIZZLED-RELATED PROTEIN 5; SFRP5
;;SECRETED APOPTOSIS-RELATED PROTEIN 3; SARP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the 'frizzled' (FZ) transmembrane protein family (see 600667)
are receptors for Wnt family members (see 164975), cysteine-rich
glycosylated ligands implicated in a variety of cellular processes,
including control of cell polarity in a number of systems, including
Drosophila retina. Secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs), such as
SFRP5, appear to act as soluble modulators of Wnt signaling by competing
with membrane-bound frizzled receptors for the binding of secreted Wnt
ligands (Chang et al., 1999).

CLONING

Chang et al. (1999) isolated bovine cDNAs encoding Sfrp5, an SFRP highly
expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). By screening human
genomic and RPE/retina libraries, they identified human SFRP5 genomic
and cDNA clones. The predicted 317-amino acid human protein shares 98%
and 95% sequence identity with bovine and mouse Sfrp5, respectively.
Like other SFRPs, SFRP5 contains an N-terminal signal peptide followed
by a region homologous to the frizzled cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Chang
et al. (1999) reported that although human SFRP5 was expressed in the
RPE, Sfrp2 (604157) was highly and preferentially expressed in bovine
retina throughout the inner nuclear layer. Thus, photoreceptors appear
to be bathed by complementary gradients of SFRP signaling
molecules/modulators. The authors speculated that these putative inverse
gradients of SFRP2 and SFRP5 might be involved in determining the
polarity of photoreceptors and perhaps other cells in the retina.

Independently, Melkonyan et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs encoding the
related proteins SARP1 (SFRP2), SARP2 (SFRP1; 604156), and SARP3
(SFRP5). Northern blot analysis revealed that the 2.2-kb SARP3 mRNA is
expressed in pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Chang et al. (1999) found that SFRP5 inhibited Wnt signaling in an assay
based on Wnt8 (see 601396)-induced axis duplication in Xenopus embryos.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chang et al. (1999) determined that the SFRP5 gene contains 3 coding
exons.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, as well as radiation hybrid
and somatic cell hybrid analyses, Chang et al. (1999) determined that
the SFRP5 gene maps to chromosome 10q24.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Li et al. (2008) found that Sfrp5-depleted Xenopus embryos had
dramatically reduced foregut gene expression and hypoplastic liver and
pancreatic buds. Cells of the foregut epithelium lacked apical-basal
polarity and were loosely adherent, resulting in collapse of the foregut
cavity. The foregut specification and morphogenesis defects were
separable and resulted from elevated canonical Wnt/beta-catenin and
noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling, respectively, and both
were mediated by Wnt11 (603699). Furthermore, Sfrp5 locally inhibited
Wnt11 to maintain foregut identity and allow foregut epithelium to form
over the mass of deep endoderm.

Ouchi et al. (2010) demonstrated that Sfrp5, a protein linked to the Wnt
signaling pathway, is an antiinflammatory adipokine whose expression is
perturbed in models of obesity and type 2 diabetes (see 125853).
Sfrp5-deficient mice fed a high-calorie diet developed severe glucose
intolerance and hepatic steatosis, and their adipose tissue showed an
accumulation of activated macrophages that was associated with
activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1; 601158) signaling
pathway. Adenovirus-mediated delivery of Sfrp5 to mouse models of
obesity ameliorated glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis. Ouchi et
al. (2010) concluded that in the setting of obesity, Sfrp5 secretion by
adipocytes exerts salutary effects on metabolic dysfunction by
controlling inflammatory cells within adipose tissue.

600242	TITLE *600242 CHEMOKINE, CC MOTIF, RECEPTOR 7; CCR7
;;EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS-INDUCED GENE 1; EBI1;;
CMKBR7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides, Schweickart et al. (1994)
identified a lymphoid-specific member of the G protein-coupled receptor
family. They showed that this receptor had been independently identified
by Birkenbach et al. (1993) as the Epstein-Barr-induced cDNA (symbol
EBI1). EBI1 is expressed in normal lymphoid tissues and in several B-
and T-lymphocyte cell lines. While the function and the ligand for EBI1
remains unknown, its sequence and gene structure suggest that it is
related to receptors that recognize chemoattractants, such as
interleukin-8 (146928), RANTES (187011), C5a, and fMet-Leu-Phe. Like the
chemoattractant receptors, EBI1 contains intervening sequences near its
5-prime end; however, EBI1 is unique in that both of its introns
interrupt the coding region of the first extracellular domain.
Schweickart et al. (1994) isolated the mouse Ebi1 cDNA and found that it
encodes a protein with 86% identity to the human homolog. Yoshida et al.
(1997) cloned a novel chemokine, a highly specific ligand for EBI1, that
they termed 'EBI1-ligand chemokine,' or ELC (602227).

GENE FUNCTION

Subsets of murine CD4+ T cells localize to different areas of the spleen
after adoptive transfer. Naive and T helper-1 (TH1) cells, which express
CCR7, home to the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath, whereas activated TH2
cells, which lack CCR7, form rings at the periphery of the T-cell zones
near B-cell follicles. Randolph et al. (1999) found that retroviral
transduction of TH2 cells with CCR7 forced them to localize in a
TH1-like pattern and inhibited their participation in B-cell help in
vivo but not in vitro. Randolph et al. (1999) concluded that
differential expression of chemokine receptors results in unique
cellular migration patterns that are important for effective immune
responses.

Sallusto et al. (1999) demonstrated that expression of CCR7 divides
human memory T cells into 2 functionally distinct subsets. CCR7- memory
cells express receptors for migration to inflamed tissues and display
immediate effector function. In contrast, CCR7+ memory cells express
lymph node homing receptors and lack immediate effector function, but
efficiently stimulate dendritic cells and differentiate into CCR7-
effector cells upon secondary stimulation. The CCR7+ and CCR7- T cells,
which Sallusto et al. (1999) named central memory (T-CM) and effector
memory (T-EM), differentiate in a step-wise fashion from naive T cells,
persist for years after immunization, and allow a division of labor in
the memory response.

For information on the role of CD45 expression in T lymphocytes, see
entry 151460. Champagne et al. (2001) evaluated CCR7 expression in
memory CD8+ T lymphocyte responses to HIV and to cytomegalovirus (CMV)
tetramers. Most memory T lymphocytes express CD45RO, but a fraction
express instead the CD45RA marker. Flow cytometric analyses of marker
expression and cell division identified 4 subsets of HIV- and
CMV-specific CD8+ T cells, representing a lineage differentiation
pattern: CD45RA+CCR7+ (double-positive); CD45RA-CCR7+; CD45RA-CCR7-
(double-negative); CD45RA+CCR7-. The capacity for cell division, as
measured by 5-(and 6-)carboxyl-fluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl
ester, and intracellular staining for the Ki67 nuclear antigen (176741),
is largely confined to the CCR7+ subsets and occurred more rapidly in
cells that are also CD45RA+. Although the double-negative cells did not
divide or expand after stimulation, they did revert to positivity for
either CD45RA or CCR7 or both. The CD45RA+CCR7- cells, considered to be
terminally differentiated, fail to divide, but do produce
interferon-gamma (147570) and express high levels of perforin (170280).
The representation of subsets specific for CMV and for HIV is distinct.
Approximately 70% of HIV-specific CD8+ memory T cells are
double-negative or preterminally differentiated compared to 40% of
CMV-specific cells. Approximately 50% of the CMV-specific CD8+ memory T
cells are terminally differentiated compared to fewer than 10% of the
HIV-specific cells. Champagne et al. (2001) proposed that terminally
differentiated CMV-specific cells are poised to rapidly intervene, while
double-positive precursor cells remain for expansion and replenishment
of the effector cell pool. Furthermore, high-dose antigen tolerance and
the depletion of HIV-specific CD4+ helper T-cell activity may keep the
HIV-specific memory CD8+ T cells at the double-negative stage, unable to
differentiate to the terminal effector state.

B lymphocytes recirculate between B cell-rich compartments (follicles or
B zones) in secondary lymphoid organs, surveying for antigen. After
antigen binding, B cells move to the boundary of B and T zones to
interact with T-helper cells. Reif et al. (2002) demonstrated that
antigen-engaged B cells have increased expression of CCR7, the receptor
for the T-zone chemokines CCL19 (also known as ELC) and CCL21 (602737),
and that they exhibit increased responsiveness to both chemoattractants.
In mice lacking lymphoid CCL19 and CCL21 chemokines, or with B cells
that lack CCR7, antigen engagement fails to cause movement to the T
zone. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, the authors demonstrated
that increased expression of CCR7 is sufficient to direct B cells to the
T zone. Reciprocally, overexpression of CXCR5 (601613), the receptor for
the B-zone chemokine CXCL13 (605149), is sufficient to overcome
antigen-induced B-cell movement to the T zone. Reif et al. (2002)
concluded that their findings defined the mechanism of B-cell
relocalization in response to antigen, and established that cell
position in vivo can be determined by the balance of responsiveness to
chemoattractants made in separate but adjacent zones.

Using RT-PCR, Pan et al. (2008) showed that both COX2 (PTGS2; 600262)
and CCR7 were upregulated in a significant number of breast tumor
samples compared with adjacent normal tissue, and that this upregulation
was associated with enhanced lymph node metastasis. Overexpression and
knockdown studies in human breast cancer cell lines revealed that COX2
acted via the prostaglandin receptors EP2 (PTGER2; 176804) and EP4
(PTGER4; 601586), resulting in increased intracellular cAMP and
activation of the PKA (see 188830)-AKT (see 164730) signaling pathway,
which led to induction of CCR7 expression. Elevated CCR7 enhanced the
migration of breast cancer cells toward lymphatic endothelial cells,
suggesting that CCR7 upregulation ultimately mediates COX2-associated
lymph node metastasis.

Using animal modeling and gene expression profiling, Buonamici et al.
(2009) showed that the chemokine receptor CCR7 is the essential adhesion
signal required for the targeting of leukemic T cells into the central
nervous system (CNS) in T-ALL. Ccr7 gene expression is controlled by the
activity of the T-ALL oncogene Notch1 (190198) and is expressed in human
tumors carrying Notch1-activating mutations. Silencing of either CCR7 or
its chemokine ligand CCL19 (602227) in an animal model of T-ALL
specifically inhibited CNS infiltration. Furthermore, murine CNS
targeting by human T-ALL cells depended on their ability to express
CCR7. Buonamici et al. (2009) concluded that their studies identified a
single chemokine-receptor interaction as a CNS 'entry' signal, and
opened the way for future pharmacologic targeting. Targeted inhibition
of CNS involvement in T-ALL could potentially decrease the intensity of
CNS-targeted therapy, thus reducing its associated short- and long-term
complications.

Using flow cytometric analysis, Beauvillain et al. (2011) demonstrated
that 10 to 30% of human and mouse neutrophils expressed surface and
intracellular CCR7 after purification. RT-PCR analysis detected CCR7
mRNA in mouse bone marrow neutrophils, but not in human or mouse
circulating neutrophils. Transwell assays showed that CCL19 and CCL21
induced human neutrophil migration after stimulation with
lipopolysaccharide and GMCSF (CSF2; 138960), indicating that CCR7
expressed on neutrophils is functional. Neutrophils from mice lacking
Ccr7 did not migrate to lymph nodes. Beauvillain et al. (2011) concluded
that a subpopulation of neutrophils constitutively express CCR7 and that
CCR7 is involved in migration of neutrophils from the periphery to lymph
nodes.

MAPPING

Schweickart et al. (1994) mapped the EBI1 gene to 17q12-q21.2 by
analysis of human/mouse somatic cell hybrid DNAs and fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

To test the function of CCR7, Forster et al. (1999) generated mice in
which the Ccr7 gene had been disrupted by gene targeting. Lymph nodes of
Ccr7-deficient mice were devoid of naive T cells and dendritic cells,
whereas the T-cell population was heavily expanded in the blood, the red
pulp of the spleen, and the bone marrow. Adoptive transfer experiments
to wildtype recipients demonstrated that the migration of Ccr7-deficient
B and T cells into lymph nodes and Peyer patches, and of T cells into
the splenic periarteriolar lymphoid sheath, was severely hampered. When
compared to wildtype B cells, Ccr7-deficient B cells rapidly left the
outer periarteriolar lymphoid sheath after being transferred into
wildtype recipients, indicating that expression of CCR7 keeps B cells
for a defined period of time in close contact with T cells to allow
effective T-cell/B-cell interactions. Therefore, the authors suggested
that the overall disturbed microarchitecture of secondary lymphoid
organs, caused by the impaired entry and retention of lymphocytes and
antigen-presenting dendritic cells, might explain why Ccr7-deficient
mice failed to mount a rapid primary B- or T-cell response.

Using transgenic mice, adoptive transfer, and flow cytometric analysis,
Ploix et al. (2001) showed that expression of a CCR7 ligand, CCL21, is
necessary for CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells to reach their steady state 'set
point,' even in lymphopenic recipients. In addition, adoptive transfer
of antigen-specific T cells into nonlymphopenic mice overexpressing
CCL21 caused autoimmune diabetes. The authors proposed that
perturbations in the expression of CCR7 ligands, such as CCL21 or CCL19,
may alter susceptibility to autoimmunity.

138610	TITLE *138610 OROSOMUCOID 2; ORM2
;;GLYCOPROTEIN, ALPHA-1-ACID, OF SERUM, TYPE 2;;
ALPHA-1-ACID GLYCOPROTEIN, TYPE 2; AGP2
DESCRIPTION Yuasa et al. (1986) performed orosomucoid phenotyping by isoelectric
focusing and immunoprinting. The band pattern of desialyzed ORM
indicated to these workers that the ORM system is controlled by 2
structural loci, ORM1 (138600) and ORM2. Whereas the ORM1 locus was
polymorphic, the ORM2 locus appeared to be monomorphic. Later, however,
Yuasa et al. (1987) demonstrated polymorphism of the ORM2 locus, with 6
alleles in the Japanese population. By studies of orosomucoid cDNA
clones isolated from mouse liver, Cooper and Papaconstantinou (1986)
showed that 2 species of ORM mRNA are transcribed from 2 distinct genes.
Escallon et al. (1987) presented evidence for the expression of a second
structural locus (ORM2) in human plasma as well as for the detection of
genetically determined variation at the ORM2 locus in American blacks by
the use of a sensitive enzyme-linked immunoblotting technique. After
thin-layer polyacrylamide isoelectric focusing (IEF) in gels containing
6 M urea, the isoprotein species coded by the second locus did not
segregate with the predominant alleles at the ORM1 locus. Variation in
ORM2 was not observed in U.S. whites or in several other populations
studied. Because of the low frequency and unlimited distribution of ORM2
variation, Escallon et al. (1987) were unable to test for linkage
between the 2 ORM loci.

By in situ hybridization using a cDNA clone for AGP2, Webb et al. (1988)
mapped both alpha-1-acid glycoprotein genes in the 9q34 band. Yuasa et
al. (1988) used a modified isoelectric focusing, in which glycerine was
omitted from gels, to differentiate ORM1 and ORM2 variants. They
demonstrated linkage disequilibrium between alleles at the 2 loci, thus
corroborating the close linkage demonstrated physically by Dente et al.
(1987). Merritt and Board (1988) presented the complete nucleotide
sequence of the ORM2 gene, which is located approximately 3.3 kb
downstream from ORM1. The derived amino acid sequence indicated at least
21 amino acid differences between the products of the 2 genes.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

610779	TITLE *610779 NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN 2; NUBP2
;;CYTOSOLIC Fe-S CLUSTER DEFICIENT 1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; CFD1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NUBP2 is a member of the NUBP/MRP gene subfamily of ATP-binding proteins
(see NUBP1; 600280) (Nakashima et al., 1999).

CLONING

Nakashima et al. (1999) cloned mouse Nubp2 and used the murine sequence
as a probe in EST database analysis, followed by screening a human
teratoma cDNA library to clone full-length human NUBP2. The 271-amino
acid human NUBP2 protein shares 72.6% amino acid similarity with mouse
Nubp2. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb NUBP2 transcript with
ubiquitous expression in all human adult and fetal tissues tested, with
highest expression in adult skeletal muscle. NUBP2 contains conserved an
ATP/GTP binding motif A (P-loop), an ATP/GTP binding motif A-prime, and
NUBP/MRP alpha and beta motifs. NUBP2 lacks an additional N-terminal
sequence with 4 cysteine residues that is present in NUBP1.

GENE FUNCTION

Roy et al. (2003) showed that yeast Cfd1 was required for cytosolic Fe-S
cluster biogenesis and conversion of mammalian IRP1 (ACO1; 100880) to
cytosolic aconitase in yeast.

Stehling et al. (2008) found that NBP35 (NUBP1) interacted with
coexpressed CFD1 in transfected HeLa cells, suggesting that, like NBP35,
CFD1 may function in the regulation of cellular iron homeostasis and
cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the NUBP2 gene to chromosome 16p13.3 based on an
alignment of the NUBP2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF118394) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Nakashima et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Nubp2 gene to the t-complex
region of chromosome 17, which shows homology of synteny to human
chromosome 16p13.3.

613555	TITLE *613555 TET ONCOGENE FAMILY, MEMBER 3; TET3
;;KIAA0401
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) gene family, including
TET3, play a role in the DNA methylation process (Langemeijer et al.,
2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned partial TET3, which they
designated KIAA0401. RT-PCR showed expression in a variety of human
tissues, most prominently in brain, placenta, lung, and thymus.

Langemeijer et al. (2009) noted that the deduced TET3 protein contains
1,660 amino acids and shares 2 C-terminal highly conserved domains, a
cys-rich region and a 2OGFeDO homology domain, with TET1 (607790) and
TET2 (612839). By real-time PCR analysis, they demonstrated that TET3,
like TET2, is ubiquitously expressed with highest expression in
hematopoietic cells, particularly of myeloid and monocytic lineage.

GENE FUNCTION

In a computational search for enzymes that could modify 5-methylcytosine
(5mC), Tahiliani et al. (2009) identified TET proteins as mammalian
homologs of the trypanosome proteins JBP1 and JBP2, which have been
proposed to oxidize the 5-methyl group of thymine. They showed that
TET1, a fusion partner of the MLL gene in acute myeloid leukemia, is a
2-oxoglutarate (2OG)- and Fe(II)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes
conversion of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in cultured cells
and in vitro. 5hmC is present in the genome of mouse embryonic stem
cells, and 5hmC levels decrease upon RNA interference-mediated depletion
of TET1. Thus, Tahiliani et al. (2009) concluded that TET proteins have
potential roles in epigenetic regulation through modification of 5mC to
5hmC.

Ito et al. (2010) extended the study of Tahiliani et al. (2009) by
demonstrating that all 3 mouse TET proteins, Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3, can
also catalyze the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC. Tet1 has an important role
in mouse embryonic stem cell maintenance through maintaining the
expression of Nanog (607937) in embryonic stem cells. Downregulation of
Nanog via Tet1 knockdown correlated with methylation of the Nanog
promoter, supporting a role for Tet1 in regulating DNA methylation
status. Furthermore, knockdown of Tet1 in preimplantation embryos
resulted in a bias towards trophectoderm differentiation. Thus, Ito et
al. (2010) concluded that their studies not only uncovered the enzymatic
activity of the Tet proteins, but also demonstrated a role for Tet1 in
embryonic stem cell maintenance and inner cell mass cell specification.

Ito et al. (2011) showed that, in addition to 5hmC, the Tet proteins can
generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) from 5mC
in an enzymatic activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, Ito et al.
(2011) revealed the presence of 5fC and 5caC in genomic DNA of mouse
embryonic stem cells and mouse organs. The genomic content of 5hmC, 5fC,
and 5caC can be increased or reduced through overexpression or depletion
of Tet proteins. Thus, Ito et al. (2011) concluded that they identified
2 previously unknown cytosine derivatives in genomic DNA as the products
of Tet proteins, and raised the possibility that DNA demethylation may
occur through Tet-catalyzed oxidation followed by decarboxylation.

He et al. (2011) demonstrated that 5mC and 5hmC in DNA are oxidized to
5caC by Tet dioxygenases in vitro and in cultured cells. 5caC is
specifically recognized and excised by thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG;
601423). Depletion of TDG in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to
accumulation of 5caC to a readily detectable level. He et al. (2011)
concluded that oxidation of 5mC by Tet proteins followed by TDG-mediated
base excision of 5caC constitutes a pathway for active DNA
demethylation.

Gu et al. (2011) reported that, within mouse zygotes, oxidation of
5-methylcytosine (5mC) occurs on the paternal genome, changing 5mC into
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Furthermore, they demonstrated that the
dioxygenase Tet3 is enriched specifically in the male pronucleus. In
Tet3-deficient zygotes from conditional knockout mice, paternal genome
conversion of 5mC into 5hmC failed to occur and the level of 5mC remains
constant. Deficiency of Tet3 also impeded the demethylation process of
the paternal Oct4 (164177) and Nanog genes and delayed the subsequent
activation of a paternally derived Oct4 transgene in early embryos.
Female mice depleted of Tet3 in the germline showed severely reduced
fecundity, and their heterozygous mutant offspring lacking maternal Tet3
suffered an increased incidence of developmental failure. Oocytes
lacking Tet3 also seemed to have a reduced ability to reprogram the
injected nuclei from somatic cells. Therefore, Gu et al. (2011)
concluded that Tet3-mediated DNA hydroxylation is involved in epigenetic
reprogramming of the zygotic paternal DNA following natural
fertilization and may also contribute to somatic cell nuclear
reprogramming during animal cloning.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the TET3
gene to chromosome 2.

312180	TITLE *312180 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2A; UBE2A
;;RAD6, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, TYPE A; RAD6A;;
HHR6A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

As deduced from the pleiotropic phenotype of rad6 deletion mutants in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the RAD6 protein plays an important role in
various cellular processes. The protein is strongly conserved in
eukaryotic evolution, a property that permitted Koken et al. (1991) to
clone to human homologs by evolutionary walking using
Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila melanogaster homologs as
'intermediates.' The human HHR6A and HHR6B (179095) proteins (HHR for
human homolog of rad6) shared about 95% amino acid sequence identity
with each other and about 70% amino acid sequence with their yeast
counterparts, but notably lacked the acidic C-terminal domain, the
occurrence of which seemed to be limited to S. cerevisiae rad6.

GENE FUNCTION

Ulrich and Jentsch (2000) demonstrated that RAD18 (605256) and RAD5
(608048), play a central role in mediating physical contacts between the
members of the RAD6 pathway. RAD5 recruits the UBC13 (603679)-MMS2
(603001) complex to DNA by means of its RING finger domain. Moreover,
RAD5 association with RAD18 brings UBC13-MMS2 into contact with the
RAD6-RAD18 complex. Interaction between the 2 RING finger proteins thus
promotes the formation of a heteromeric complex in which the 2 distinct
ubiquitin-conjugating activities of RAD6 and UBC13-MMS2 can be closely
coordinated. Ulrich and Jentsch (2000) found that while UBC13 and MMS2
are largely cytosolic proteins, DNA damage triggers their redistribution
to the nucleus.

Hishida et al. (2009) examined the response of yeast cells to chronic
low dose ultraviolet light (CLUV) and identified a key role for the
RAD6-RAD18-RAD5 error-free postreplication repair (PRR) pathway in
promoting cell growth and survival. They found that loss of the RAD6
error-free PRR pathway resulted in DNA damage checkpoint-induced G2
arrest in CLUV-exposed cells, whereas wildtype and nucleotide excision
repair-deficient cells were largely unaffected. Cell cycle arrest in the
absence of the RAD6 error-free PRR pathway was not caused by a repair
defect or by the accumulation of ultraviolet-induced photoproducts.
Hishida et al. (2009) observed increased replication protein A (RPA; see
179835)- and Rad52 (600392)-yellow fluorescent protein foci in the
CLUV-exposed Rad18 (605256)-delta cells and demonstrated that
Rad52-mediated homologous recombination is required for the viability of
the Rad18-delta cells after release from CLUV-induced G2 arrest. These
and other data presented suggest that, in response to environmental
levels of ultraviolet exposure, the RAD6 error-free PRR pathway promotes
replication of damaged templates without the generation of extensive
single-stranded DNA regions. Thus this pathway is specifically important
during chronic low dose ultraviolet exposure to prevent
counterproductive DNA checkpoint activation and allow cells to
proliferate normally.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization with biotinylated probes, Koken et al. (1992)
localized the RAD6A gene to Xq24-q25 and the RAD6B gene (179095) to
5q23-q31. The assignment of RAD6A to the X chromosome was confirmed with
an X-specific human-mouse/hamster somatic cell hybrid panel.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 males with X-linked syndromic mental retardation (MRXSN; 300860),
Nascimento et al. (2006) identified a nonsense mutation in the UBE2A
gene (Q128X; 312180.0001). The presumptive obligate carriers had
completely skewed X inactivation in leukocytes, as demonstrated by the
methylation status of the CAG repeat of the androgen receptor gene
(313700). Indeed, skewed X-chromosome inactivation appears to be
characteristic of carriers of many gene mutations involved in XLMR
(Plenge et al., 2002). This prompted a search for an X-linked gene
involved in the syndrome in this family. Given the family's small size,
an inclusion-mapping strategy was performed. Genotyping of 36 markers
spaced at approximately 5 cM disclosed 3 loci, at Xq23-q25, harboring
alleles shared by all 3 affected males. Nascimento et al. (2006) found
30 genes within a narrowed candidate region that were expressed in
brain. However, only 1 of these gene, UBE2A, was expressed in both brain
and lymphocytes. Because of the skewed X-inactivation in the patients'
mothers, which likely represented the survival/proliferation advantage
of lymphocytes with the active normal allele in a woman with the
mutation, the authors sequenced the UBE2A gene and found a 382C-T
substitution leading to a premature stop codon (Q128X; 312180) in all 3
affected males and in their mothers. The sister of 1 of the affected
males, with a rather random X-inactivation pattern as documented by the
methylation status of the AR gene, did not carry this mutation. No
mutations in UBE2A were found in 19 idiopathic XLMR-affected families
mapped to intervals encompassing UBE2A.

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with syndromic XLMR, Budny
et al. (2010) identified 2 different missense mutations in the UBE2A
gene (312180.0002 and 312180.0003, respectively). The phenotype was
characterized by mental retardation and very poor speech, as well as
striking dysmorphic features, including large head, synophrys, prominent
supraorbital ridges, almond-shaped and deep-set eyes, large ears, wide
mouth, myxedematous appearance, hirsutism, abnormal hair whorls,
micropenis, and onychodystrophy.

sibships connected through carrier females in 2 generations, Nascimento
et al. (2006) identified a 382C-T transition in the UBE2A gene leading
to a premature UAG stop codon (gln128 to stop; Q128X). As a consequence
of the mutation, the predicted polypeptide lacked the 25 C-terminal
amino acid residues. The importance of this terminal sequence for UBE2
function was inferred by its conservation in vertebrates and in
Drosophila. No UBE2A mutations were found in 15 families with
nonsyndromic and 4 families with syndromic idiopathic XLMR previously
mapped to intervals encompassing this gene. This was the first
description of a mutation in a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme gene as the
cause of a human disease. The affected males in the family presented a
neurodevelopmental disorder that included seizures, severe speech
impairment, marked general hirsutism, synophrys, and a low posterior
hairline.

In affected members of a large 5-generation family with X-linked
syndromic mental retardation (300860), Budny et al. (2010) identified a
67G-A transition in exon 2 of the UBE2A gene, resulting in a
gly23-to-arg (G23R) substitution in a highly conserved residue. The
mutation was not found in unaffected family members or in 168 male
controls. Three obligate female carriers showed skewed X-inactivation
profiles. The mutation was found by linkage analysis followed by
candidate gene sequencing. Functional studies were not performed.

the UBE2A gene, resulting in an arg11-to-gln (R11Q) substitution in a

603608	TITLE *603608 CARBONYL REDUCTASE 3; CBR3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Carbonyl reductase (CBR; EC 1.1.1.184) catalyzes the reduction of a
large number of biologically and pharmacologically active carbonyl
compounds to their corresponding alcohols.

CLONING

By analyzing sequences from the 21q22.2 chromosomal region, Watanabe et
al. (1998) identified genomic clones corresponding to CBR1 (114830) and
to CBR3, a novel carbonyl reductase gene. The deduced 277-amino acid
CBR3 protein is 84% similar to the CBR1 protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

The CBR3 gene contains 3 exons spanning 11.2 kb (Watanabe et al., 1998).

MAPPING

Watanabe et al. (1998) found that the CBR3 gene is located 62 kb
telomeric of CBR1 on chromosome 21q22.2.

ELAFIN;;
ELASTASE-SPECIFIC INHIBITOR; ESI;;

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PI3 is a serine protease inhibitor that plays a major role as an
antiinflammatory mediator at mucosal surfaces. In addition, PI3 has
antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial
and fungal pathogens (summary by Ghosh et al., 2009).

CLONING

Chang et al. (1990) and Schalkwijk et al. (1990, 1991) described a low
molecular weight elastase inhibitor derived from psoriatic skin and
termed SKALP for 'skin-derived antileukoproteinase.' They demonstrated
that this inhibitor can be found in the epidermis of several
inflammatory skin diseases, but not in normal human epidermis. Wiedow et
al. (1990) referred to this molecule as elafin, and Sallenave and Ryle
(1991) referred to it as elastase-specific inhibitor. It is found in the
urine of psoriatic patients, and immunohistochemical studies showed that
SKALP/elafin is found in the suprabasal differentiated keratinocytes of
psoriatic epidermis. Molhuizen et al. (1993) isolated a precursor of
SKALP/elafin from cultured keratinocytes and cloned its cDNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Elafin is an antiproteinase and antimicrobial molecule that is expressed
at epithelial sites (for example, cervix) (Sallenave, 2000). King et al.
(2003) studied the expression and regulation of elafin in human
endometrium. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that expression of elafin
mRNA peaked during menstruation. Elafin protein was localized to
leukocytes scattered in the endometrial stroma during the late secretory
and menstrual phases. The authors concluded that endometrium expresses
elafin in a menstruation-dependent manner.

Using RT-PCR and ELISA, Ghosh et al. (2009) detected elafin production
in the female reproductive tract. Elafin production was enhanced
following poly (I:C) stimulation. Recombinant elafin inhibited both
lymphotropic and macrophage-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1
strains in a dose-dependent manner, possibly through direct interaction
with the virus. Secreted elafin levels were higher, although not
significantly, in cervico-vaginal lavages of HIV-1-negative women
compared with HIV-1-positive women, and they were also higher in the
secretory phase of the menstrual cycle compared with the proliferative
phase. Ghosh et al. (2009) proposed that elafin may be an important
endogenous microbicide in the female reproductive tract that is
protective against HIV-1.

MAPPING

Molhuizen et al. (1994) localized the PI3 gene to chromosome 20 by study
of somatic cell hybrids and to 20q12-q13 by in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kuijpers et al. (1998) could find no allelic association between
pustular psoriasis, or psoriasis in general (see 177900), and
polymorphism of the PI3 gene. The study was prompted by the finding of a
decrease of SKALP, at the protein level, in lesional skin of patients
with pustular psoriasis compared with plaque-type psoriasis.

611558	TITLE *611558 UROPLAKIN 2; UPK2
;;UP2;;
UPII
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) forms the apical plaques of mammalian
urothelium and is believed to strengthen the urothelial apical surface
and prevent the cells from rupturing during bladder distention. The
major conserved integral membrane proteins of the AUM are UPK1A
(611557), UPK1B (602380), UPK2, and UPK3 (UPK3A; 611559).

CLONING

Wu et al. (1994) isolated AUMs from 8 mammalian species, including
human. Western blot analysis detected UPK2 at an apparent molecular mass
slightly lower than that of 15-kD bovine Upk2. Electron microscopy
revealed that AUMs isolated from cattle, dog, mouse, and monkey were
12-nm protein particles forming hexagonally packed crystalline patches.

Using murine and bovine Upk2 sequences as query, followed by RT-PCR of
human urothelial mRNA, Lobban et al. (1998) cloned full-length UPK2,
which they called UPII. The deduced 184-amino acid protein shares 87%
and 89% identity with the murine and bovine proteins, respectively.
RT-PCR showed that UPK2 was expressed at high levels in normal
urothelium and in moderately differentiated transitional cell urothelium
carcinomas. In situ hybridization detected UPK2 expression restricted to
the superficial cells of normal urothelium. No expression was detected
in any of the nonurothelial tissues examined.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the UPK2 gene to chromosome 11q23.3 based on an
alignment of the UPK2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB009454) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1.).

176875	TITLE *176875 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, CATALYTIC SUBUNIT, ALPHA ISOFORM; PPP1CA
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, ALPHA SUBUNIT; PPP1A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein phosphorylation, a crucial posttranslational modification that
controls many diverse cellular functions, is dependent on the opposing
actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Protein
phosphatase-1 (PP1) is 1 of 4 major protein phosphatases identified in
the cytosol of eukaryotic cells that are responsible for the
dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in proteins. Although
all 4 protein phosphatases have overlapping substrate specificities in
vitro, they can be distinguished by the use of inhibitor proteins and by
their dependence on metal ions. PP1 is inhibited by nanomolar
concentrations of 2 thermostable proteins, inhibitor-1 (PPP1R1A; 613246)
and inhibitor-2 (PPP1R2; 601792), whereas the other 3 phosphatases (see
PPP2CA; 176915) are unaffected by these inhibitors. PPP1CA encodes a
catalytic subunit of PP1 that forms heterodimers with various PP1
regulatory subunits (e.g., PPP1R3A; 600917). These regulatory subunits
target PP1 to particular subcellular locations and selectively enhance
its activity toward certain substrates (Cohen and Cohen, 1989).

CLONING

Barker et al. (1990) isolated a cDNA encoding 1 isoform (PP1-alpha) of
the catalytic subunit of human protein phosphatase-1.

Using 2 regions conserved within PP1 genes, Song et al. (1993) amplified
a partial PPP1CA sequence by PCR, and they screened a cDNA library using
this product to obtain a full-length clone. The deduced 330-amino acid
protein shows complete concordance with the rabbit protein. Northern
blot analysis revealed 1.6-kb transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Genoux et al. (2002) demonstrated that PP1 determined the efficacy of
learning and memory by limiting acquisition and favoring memory decline.
When PP1 is genetically inhibited during learning, short intervals
between training episodes are sufficient for optimal performance.
Enhanced learning correlates with increased phosphorylation of CREB
(123810), of CAMKII (114078), and of the GLUR1 subunit of the AMPA
receptor (138248); it also correlates with CREB-dependent gene
expression that, in control mice, occurs only with widely distributed
training. Inhibition to PP1 prolongs memory when induced after learning,
suggesting that PP1 also promotes forgetting. Genoux et al. (2002)
suggested that this property may account for age-related cognitive
decay, as old mutant mice had preserved memory. They concluded that
their findings emphasized the physiologic importance of PP1 as a
suppressor of learning and memory, and as a potential mediator of
cognitive decline during aging.

Danial et al. (2003) undertook a proteomic analysis to assess whether
BAD (603167) might participate in mitochondrial physiology. In liver
mitochondria, BAD resides in a functional holoenzyme complex together
with protein kinase A (see 176911) and PP1 catalytic units, WAVE1
(605035) as an A kinase-anchoring protein, and glucokinase (138079).
Using mitochondria from hepatocytes of Bad-deficient mice, Danial et al.
(2003) demonstrated that BAD is required to assemble the complex, the
lack of which results in diminished mitochondria-based glucokinase
activity and blunted mitochondrial respiration in response to glucose.
Glucose deprivation results in dephosphorylation of BAD, and
BAD-dependent cell death.

In CT26 mouse colon cancer cells, Obeid et al. (2007) demonstrated that
anthracyclins induced immunogenic cell death by way of a rapid,
preapoptotic translocation of calreticulin (CALR; 109091) to the cell
surface. Anthracyclin-induced Calr translocation was mimicked by
inhibition of the Ppp1ca/Gadd34 (PPP1R15A; 611048) complex.
Administration of recombinant Calr or inhibitors of Ppp1ca/Gadd34
restored the immunogenicity of cell death elicited by etoposide and
mitomycin C and enhanced their antitumor effects in vivo.

Novoyatleva et al. (2008) identified a consensus PP1-binding motif,
RVxF, in the RNA recognition motifs of several splicing factors,
including TRA2-beta (SFRS10; 602719), SF2/ASF (SFRS1; 600812), and
SRp30c (SFRS9; 601943). PP1 bound directly to this motif in TRA2-beta
and dephosphorylated the protein, altering its interaction with other
proteins. Reducing PP1 activity promoted usage of numerous alternative
exons, including the inclusion of the SMN2 (601627) exon 7 in mice
expressing the human gene. Novoyatleva et al. (2008) concluded that PP1
has a role in splice site selection.

By immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis of PP1 complexes
in HEK293 cells, Lee et al. (2010) identified a complex containing PNUTS
(PPP1R10; 603771), TOX4 (614032), WDR82 (611059), and any 1 of the 3 PP1
catalytic subunits, PP1-alpha, PP1-beta (PPP1CB; 600590), or PP1-gamma
(PPP1CC; 176914). The complex, which they called PTW/PP1, had an
apparent molecular mass of about 200 kD, suggesting that it contains 1
molecule of each subunit. Mutation analysis revealed that human
PP1-alpha interacted with the RVxF motif of mouse Pnuts. PP1-alpha did
not interact directly with human TOX4 and WDR82. The PTW/PP1 complex
efficiently dephosphorylated the isolated C-terminal domain of the large
subunit of mouse RNA polymerase II (POLR2A; 180660) in vitro. The
PTW/PP1 complex was stable throughout the cell cycle in HEK293 cells,
but its association with chromatin was regulated. PTW/PP1 associated
with chromatin during interphase, was excluded from condensed
chromosomes during early mitosis, and was reloaded onto chromosomes at
late telophase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Terrak et al. (2004) demonstrated the crystal structure at 2.7-angstrom
resolution of the complex between PP1 and a 34-kD N-terminal domain of
the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit MYPT1 (602021). MYPT1 is the
protein that regulates PP1 function in smooth muscle relaxation.
Structural elements amino- and carboxy-terminal to the RVXF motif of
MYPT1 are positioned in a way that leads to a pronounced reshaping of
the catalytic cleft of PP1, contributing to the increased myosin
specificity of this complex. Terrak et al. (2004) concluded that the
structure has general implications for the control of PP1 activity by
other regulatory subunits.

MAPPING

Barker et al. (1990) mapped the PPP1A gene to 11q13 by Southern analysis
of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization. Because of
evidence that PP1-alpha is a tumor suppressor and because of the
assignment to 11q13, PPP1A is a candidate gene for type I multiple
endocrine neoplasia (131100), which maps to the same area.
Translocations involving breakpoints at 11q13 have been observed in
lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia of the B-cell type (see 151400),
and multiple myeloma. Other oncogenes or suppressors mapping to 11q13
include HST (164980), INT2 (164950), SEA (165110), and ST3 (191181).

Richard et al. (1991) described a high resolution radiation hybrid map
of 11q12-q13, which placed the PPP1A locus at the extreme end of a
cluster of more than 12 genes with C1NH (606860) at the other end and
with GST3 (134660) as its closest neighbor in the linear array. Using
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Saadat et al. (1995) mapped PPP1CA
to human 11q13, rat 1q43, and mouse 7E3-F2. The results indicated that
PPP1CA is a member of a group of genes showing homology of synteny.

ANIMAL MODEL

Carr et al. (2002) noted that increased PP1 activity has been observed
in end-stage human heart failure. They developed a mouse model for
cardiac tissue-specific overexpression of PP1 by introducing PPP1CA
inserted downstream of the mouse alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter.
Overexpression of PP1 was associated with depressed cardiac function,
dilated cardiomyopathy, and premature mortality, consistent with heart
failure. Knockout of Ipp1 was associated with moderate increases in PP1
activity and impaired beta-adrenergic contractile responses. Expression
of constitutively active IPP1 in failing human myocytes in culture was
associated with rescue of beta-adrenergic responsiveness.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are enzymes that charge tRNAs with specific
amino acids. Cytoplasmic phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase is a heterodimer
consisting of a catalytic alpha subunit, FARSA, and a regulatory beta
subunit, FARSB (609690) (Rodova et al., 1999).

CLONING

Using subtractive hybridization, Sen et al. (1997) identified a gene
that is differentially expressed between a tumorigenic human acute-phase
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 608232) cell line and its nontumorigenic
variant. Sequence analysis of the predicted 508-amino acid protein,
called CML33, revealed that it has homology to the catalytic subunit of
prokaryotic and S. cerevisiae phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases (PheRS).
Recombinant CML33 reacted with antibodies against sheep liver PheRS on
Western blots. Since CML33 does not have the leader sequence
characteristic of mitochondrial proteins and does not resemble yeast
mitochondrial PheRS, Sen et al. (1997) suggested that it is a subunit of
human cytoplasmic PheRS. Using Northern blot analysis, the authors
determined that CML33 expression is sensitive to the stage of the cell
cycle and to induction of differentiation. Expression of the 1.8-kb
transcript is also substantially enhanced in tumorigenic cells. Sen et
al. (1997) noted that CML33 is the first member of the tRNA synthetase
gene family shown to exhibit this type of regulated expression.

By database analysis, RT-PCR using embryonic kidney cell RNA, and
screening a fetal kidney cDNA library, Rodova et al. (1999) cloned
FARSA. The 508-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 57
kD. Sequence alignment of FARSA orthologs from multiple species showed
conservation of active site regions and suggested that the heterodimer
of FARSA and FARSB forms a 4-helix bundle interface similar to that in
Thermus thermophilus. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.4-kb
transcript in heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
pancreas. Expression was stronger in malignant cell lines compared with
normal tissue.

GENE FUNCTION

Rodova et al. (1999) showed that COS-7 cells transfected with FARSA and
FARSB increase phenylalanine charging of tRNA.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Sen et al. (1997) mapped the
CML33 gene to chromosome 19. Rasooly (1998) noted that the CML33 gene
was contained within genomic clones from chromosomal region 19p13.2
(Genbank GENBANK AD000092).

;;HELICASE ANTIGEN; HAGE
DESCRIPTION For background information on tumor antigens recognized by cytolytic T
lymphocytes, see SAGE (300359).

CLONING

To identify genes with tumor-specific expression, Martelange et al.
(2000) applied a cDNA subtraction approach, i.e., representational
difference analysis, to a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. They
obtained 2 cDNAs that appeared to be tumor specific and named the
corresponding genes SAGE and HAGE because they had the same pattern of
expression as genes of the MAGE family (e.g., MAGEA1; 300016). The
putative HAGE protein contains 648 amino acids and is a member of the
DEAD box family of ATP-dependent RNA helicases (see 600396). Northern
blot analysis detected expression of a 2.2-kb HAGE transcript in tumors
of various histologic types at a level that was 100-fold higher than
that observed in normal tissues, except for testis.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Martelange et al. (2000) mapped the HAGE
gene to 6q12-q13.

602044	TITLE *602044 UNCOUPLING PROTEIN 3; UCP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Boss et al. (1997) and Vidal-Puig et al. (1997) described the cloning of
UCP3 cDNAs. Both groups derived their clones from human skeletal muscle
libraries, and both reported that UCP3 is approximately 57% and 73%
identical to human UCP1 (113730) and UCP2 (601693), respectively. Boss
et al. (1997) and Solanes et al. (1997) cloned a short isoform of UCP3
(UCP3S) containing 275 amino acids and a long isoform of UCP3 (UCP3L)
containing 312 amino acids. UCP3S contains 3 mitochondrial
energy-transfer-protein domains and 5 putative transmembrane domains,
while UCP3L contains an additional 37 amino acids at its C terminus that
encodes a putative transmembrane domain and a putative purine
nucleotide-binding domain. Solanes et al. (1997) determined that UCP3S
is generated when a cleavage and polyadenylation signal within the last
intron prematurely terminates message elongation. Boss et al. (1997)
used Northern blot analysis to show that in human tissue UCP3 is
expressed as a 2.3-kb message in skeletal muscle and heart. In rat
tissue, UCP3 transcripts were found in heart, brown adipose tissue,
white adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Boss et al. (1997) examined UCP expression in cold-adapted rats and
found that, unlike UCP1, the expression levels of UCP2 and UCP3 were not
affected by cold. Nonetheless, the authors concluded that UCP3 may be
involved in thermogenesis through the uncoupling of oxidative
phosphorylation in skeletal muscle.

Millet et al. (1997) observed an increase in the levels of UCP2 and UCP3
mRNA in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue from both lean and obese
individuals undergoing fasting. They suggested that the increase
indicates a role for these proteins in the metabolic adaptation to
fasting. The similar induction of gene expression observed during
fasting in lean and obese subjects show that there is no major
alteration of UCP2 and UCP3 gene regulation in adipose tissue and
skeletal muscle of obese subjects. UCP2 is widely expressed in human
tissues, whereas UCP3 expression seems to be restricted to skeletal
muscle, an important site of thermogenesis in humans.

With the capacity to participate in thermogenesis and energy balance,
UCP3 is an important obesity candidate gene. Bouchard et al. (1997)
demonstrated linkage between markers at the UCP2/UCP3 region with
resting metabolic rate. This region is syntenic to a region of mouse
chromosome 7 that has been linked to hyperinsulinemia and obesity
(Fleury et al., 1997).

Liu et al. (1998) and Hinz et al. (1999) showed that expression of UCP3
in yeast resulted in reduced cellular growth and a significant decrease
in mitochondria membrane potential. Hinz et al. (1999) found that
cellular respiration coupled to oxidative phosphorylation decreased,
while cellular heat production increased. Liu et al. (1998) found that
adenovirus-mediated leptin (164160) expression in obese ob/ob mice led
to increased expression of Ucp3 in skeletal muscle, as well as
significant weight loss.

UCP1 diverts energy from ATP synthesis to thermogenesis in the
mitochondria of brown adipose by catalyzing a regulated leak of protons
across the inner membrane. UCP2 and UCP3 are present at much lower
abundance than UCP1, and the uncoupling with which they are associated
is not significantly thermogenic. Mild uncoupling would, however,
decrease the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, which
are important mediators of oxidative damage. Echtay et al. (2002)
demonstrated that superoxide increases mitochondrial proton conductance
through effects on UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3. Superoxide-induced uncoupling
requires fatty acids and is inhibited by purine nucleotides.
Superoxide-induced uncoupling correlates with the tissue expression of
UCPs and appears in mitochondria from yeast expressing UCP1. Skeletal
muscle mitochondria express only UCP3; therefore superoxide-induced
uncoupling is absent in the skeletal muscle of UCP3 knockout mice.
Echtay et al. (2002) concluded that the interaction of superoxide with
UCPs may be a mechanism for decreasing the concentrations of reactive
oxygen species inside mitochondria.

In 9 healthy male volunteers, Hesselink et al. (2003) measured the
phosphocreatine resynthesis rate following intense anoxic contraction,
which is a sensitive index of in vivo mitochondrial function, after 7
days on a low-fat diet and again after 7 days on a high-fat diet. The
high-fat diet increased UCP3 protein content in muscle by 44% compared
to the low-fat diet, but this increase in UCP3 was not associated with
any changes in the rate of muscle phosphocreatine resynthesis during
conditions of maximal flux through oxidative phosphorylation. Hesselink
et al. (2003) concluded that the primary role of UCP3 in humans is not
uncoupling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Solanes et al. (1997) determined that the UCP3 gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 8.5 kb. The coding sequence uses exons 2 to 7 and spans
about 5.25 kb.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

The observation that UCP3 is increased in situations where fatty acid
entry into the mitochondria may exceed the beta-oxidation capacity
suggested to Russell et al. (2003) that this protein may be involved in
the outward translocation of fatty acid from the mitochondrial matrix.
The authors performed biochemical and molecular tests using muscle from
patients with riboflavin-responsive multiple acylcoenzyme A
dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD; 231680), a lipid storage myopathy
characterized by a decrease in fatty acid beta-oxidation capacity. The
results demonstrated decreases in fatty acid beta-oxidation and in the
activities of respiratory chain complexes I (see 157655) and II (see
600857), associated with increases of 3.1- and 1.7-fold in UCP3 mRNA and
protein expression, respectively. The authors postulated that
upregulation of UCP3 in MADD is due to the accumulation of muscle fatty
acid/acylCoA. The authors considered MADD an optimal model to study the
hypothesis that UCP3 is involved in the outward translocation of an
excess of fatty acid from the mitochondria and to show that, in humans,
the effects of fatty acid on UCP3 expression are direct and independent
of fatty acid beta-oxidation.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and PCR of P1 and BAC genomic clones,
Solanes et al. (1997) mapped the UCP3 gene to chromosome 11q13, adjacent
to the UCP2 gene. Walder et al. (1998) pointed out that the UCP2 and
UCP3 genes constitute a cluster that maps to 11q13. Boss et al. (1998)
described the genomic structure of the UCP3 gene and mapped the gene to
11q13 by somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analysis. Pecqueur et
al. (1999) determined that the UCP2 gene is located 7 kb downstream of
the UCP3 gene.

By PCR of mouse P1 and BAC clones, Solanes et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse Ucp3 and Ucp2 genes to chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Argyropoulos et al. (1998) identified a missense polymorphism in exon 3
(V102I; 602044.0001) of the UCP3 gene. A mutation introducing a stop
codon in exon 4 (R143X; 602044.0002) and a terminal polymorphism in the
splice donor junction of exon 6 (602044.0003) were also identified in an
individual who was morbidly obese and diabetic. Allele frequencies of
the exon 3 and exon 6 splice junction polymorphisms were determined and
found to be similar in Gullah-speaking African Americans and the Mende
tribe of Sierra Leone, but absent in Caucasians. Moreover, in exon 6
splice donor heterozygotes, basal fat oxidation rates were reduced by
50%, and the respiratory quotient was markedly increased compared with
wildtype individuals, implicating a role for UCP3 in metabolic fuel
partitioning.

Brown et al. (1999) found that expression of native human UCP3 mutations
in yeast showed complete loss (R70W; 602044.0004), significant reduction
(R143X; 602044.0002), or no effect (V102I; 602044.0001 and +1G-A;
602044.0003) on the uncoupling activity of UCP3. The authors concluded
that certain mutations in UCP3 alter its functional impact on membrane
potential, possibly conferring susceptibility to metabolic diseases.

Dalgaard et al. (2001) tested whether variation of the UCP3 promoter is
associated with either juvenile or maturity-onset obesity or body weight
change over a 26-year follow-up among Danish subjects. Mutation
screening of approximately 1 kb 5-prime upstream of the UCP3 gene
revealed a C-to-T variant at -55 (dbSNP rs1800849). The frequency of
this polymorphism was evaluated by restriction fragment length
polymorphism analysis in 4 groups: 1) a group of 744 obese Danish men
who at the draft board examinations had a BMI of at least 31 kg/m2; 2) a
randomly selected control group consisting of 857 draftees; 3) 258
middle-aged subjects; and 4) 409 sixty-year-old subjects. The frequency
of the T allele was 26.0% among the obese draftees and 26.9% in the
control group. The authors concluded that this variant does not play a
major role in the development of common obesity among Danish subjects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Clapham et al. (2000) created transgenic mice that overexpress human
UCP3 in skeletal muscle. UCP3 expression was driven by the human
alpha-skeletal actin (102610) promoter, limiting expression to skeletal
muscle. Clapham et al. (2000) bred 3 independent lines to homozygosity
and selected a line of mice that had a 66-fold increase in UCP3
expression. These mice were hyperphagic but weighed less than their
wildtype littermates. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a striking
reduction in adipose tissue mass. The mice also exhibited lower fasting
plasma glucose and insulin levels and an increased glucose clearance
rate. Clapham et al. (2000) concluded that their data provided evidence
that skeletal muscle UCP3 has the potential to influence metabolic rates
and glucose homeostasis in the whole animal. Choi et al. (2007) showed
that transgenic mice that overexpress human UCP3 in skeletal muscle were
completely protected against the fat-induced defects and insulin
resistance developed in wildtype mice fed a high-fat diet. Protection
was associated with a lower membrane-to-cytosolic ratio of
diacylglycerol and reduced PKC-theta (600448) activity.

Uncoupling protein-3 is a mitochondrial protein that can diminish the
mitochondrial membrane potential. Levels of muscle UCP3 mRNA are
increased by thyroid hormone and fasting. Gong et al. (2000) produced
Ucp3 knockout mice to test the hypothesis that UCP3 influences metabolic
efficiency and is a candidate obesity gene. The Ucp3 -/- mice had no
detectable immunoreactive UCP3 by Western blot analysis. In mitochondria
from the knockout mice, proton leak was greatly reduced in muscle,
minimally reduced in brown fat, and not reduced at all in liver. These
data suggested that UCP3 accounts for much of the proton leak in
skeletal muscle. Despite the lack of UCP3, no consistent phenotypic
abnormality was observed in the mice. They were not obese and had normal
serum insulin, triglyceride, and leptin levels, with a tendency toward
reduced free fatty acids and glucose. Knockout mice showed a normal
circadian rhythm in body temperature and motor activity and had normal
body temperature responses to fasting, stress, thyroid hormone, and cold
exposure. The baseline metabolic rate and respiratory exchange ratio
were the same in knockout and control mice, as were the effects of
fasting, a beta-3 adrenergic agonist, and thyroid hormone on these
parameters. The phenotype of Ucp1/Ucp3 double knockout mice was
indistinguishable from Ucp1 single knockout mice. The data suggested
that Ucp3 is not a major determinant of metabolic rate but, rather, has
other functions.

In Ucp3 knockout mice, Vidal-Puig et al. (2000) found that skeletal
muscle mitochondria lacking Ucp3 are more coupled (i.e., increased state
3/state 4 ratio), indicating that Ucp3 has uncoupling activity. In
addition, production of reactive oxygen species was increased in
mitochondria lacking Ucp3. Despite these effects on mitochondrial
function, Ucp3 did not seem to be required for body weight regulation,
exercise tolerance, fatty acid oxidation, or cold-induced thermogenesis.

Mills et al. (2003) found that mice deficient in Ucp3 have a diminished
thermogenic response to the drug MDMA, also known as 'ecstasy,' and did
not die from a dose of 40 mg kg(-1), which killed 30% of wildtype
littermates. Although the baseline temperature of Ucp3 -/- mice was
indistinguishable from that of wildtype animals, Ucp3-deficient mice
showed a significantly blunted rise in both skeletal muscle and rectal
temperature following MDMA administration. Mills et al. (2003) concluded
that UCP3 is important in MDMA-induced hyperthermia.

UCP3, 304G-A, VAL102ILE

In a Gullah-speaking African American woman with severe obesity (601665)
and type II diabetes (125853), Argyropoulos et al. (1998) found
heterozygosity for a val102-to-ile (V102I) mutation of the UCP3 gene,
located in the first cytosol-oriented extramembranous loop. Three
overweight children in this family were found to be homozygous for the
V102I polymorphism. The fourth child, a 9-year-old male with a body mass
index (BMI) of 18.5, was heterozygous for the V102I polymorphism. No
paternal sample was available but the father was presumed to be at least
heterozygous for the V102I polymorphism. The polymorphism was not found
in genomic DNA from 128 Caucasian Americans. However, examination of 280
African Americans revealed that 4% of individuals were homozygous and
28% heterozygous for the polymorphism. In the Mende tribe in Sierra
Leone, 3% of the population was found to be homozygous A/A and 21%
heterozygous G/A.

UCP3, ARG143TER

In a 16-year-old with morbid obesity (601665) (BMI = 51.8) and type II
diabetes (125853), Argyropoulos et al. (1998) found compound
heterozygosity for a 427C-T transition in exon 4, resulting in the
introduction of a premature stop codon at residue 143, arg143 to ter
(R143X), in the third, matrix-oriented loop. In addition, the patient
was heterozygous for a guanine to adenine polymorphism at the splice
donor site of exon 6 (Ggt-Gat), resulting in loss of the splice junction
and premature termination of the protein product in the sixth,
matrix-oriented loop (602044.0003). A putative protein resulting from
this mutation would be identical to that encoded by the short transcript
of UCP3 mRNA. Pedigree analysis and DNA sequence determination of family
members showed that the R143X mutation was transmitted to the compound
heterozygous proband from the grandmother, through the mother, in
typical mendelian fashion. The heterozygous polymorphism at the exon 6
splice donor junction (Ggt-Gat) was not detected in the maternal lineage
and was most likely transmitted from the father, whose DNA was not
available for analysis, but may have arisen as a new change.
Argyropoulos et al. (1998) examined an additional 168 individuals
comprising both African Americans and Caucasians for the 2 nucleotide
changes. The R143X mutation was not detected in any other individual in
either racial group. The exon 6 splice donor stop mutation, however, was
detected in African-American subjects but not in Caucasians. An
identical allele frequency (G, 90% and A, 10%) was found in
Gullah-speaking African Americans and the Mende tribe. No homozygous
subjects for the polymorphism (a/a) were detected in 287 Gullah-speaking
African Americans and only 3 homozygotes were identified in 192 subjects
of the Mende tribe. Haplotype analysis of 2 polymorphisms, V102I
(602044.0001) and the exon 6 splice donor Ggt-Gat, showed that the 2
genotypes were independent.

UCP3, IVS6, G-A, +1

In a 16-year-old female with morbid obesity (601665), Argyropoulos et
al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for a polymorphism at the exon
6 splice donor junction (Ggt-Gat) and the R143X mutation (602004.0002).
The rare R143X mutation was inherited in the maternal line; the splice
site polymorphism was presumably transmitted from the father. The g-to-a
transition at the splice donor site of exon 6 resulted in loss of the
splice junction and truncation of the protein product at the first tga
stop codon of the adjacent intron.

Among unrelated individuals, Argyropoulos et al. (1998) found that
heterozygotes for the exon 6 splice donor polymorphism had a 50%
reduction in fat oxidation adjusted for lean body mass and a marked
elevation in the nonprotein respiratory quotient, compared with wildtype
subjects. No significant differences were found between heterozygotes
and wildtype individuals for BMI, percentage of body fat, and resting
energy expenditure adjusted for lean body mass. The same analyses
performed for the V102I polymorphism (602044.0001) showed no significant
differences between heterozygotes and wildtype individuals for any of
the aforementioned quantitative traits. Nonetheless, the African
American population studied had a high prevalence of obesity; therefore,
the possibility that this could mask a potential effect of UCP3
mutations on BMI was also examined. Indeed, Argyropoulos et al. (1998)
found that the frequency of the g/a heterozygous genotype was nearly
twice as high (P = 0.04) in obese (30%) compared with lean (16%)
individuals.

Brown et al. (1999) identified a rare mutation in UCP3, arg70-to-trp, in
a 15-year-old male of Chinese descent with severe obesity (601665) and
type II diabetes (125853). Alignments showed that the mutated valine and
arginine residues in V102I (602044.0001) and R70W are completely
conserved in all known UCPs, including the plant UCP, suggesting that
these residues may play an important functional role. Brown et al.
(1999) expressed native human UCP3 mutations in yeast and showed
complete loss on the uncoupling activity of UCP3 with R70W and no effect
on this activity with V102I.

614855	TITLE *614855 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 14; TBC1D14
;;KIAA1322
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Autophagy is a bulk degradation process induced in cells by a range of
pathologic conditions, including starvation. In autophagy, portions of
cytoplasm are enclosed in a double-membrane autophagosome and targeted
for degradation by fusion with endosomes and lysosomes. TBC1D14 is a
negative regulator of autophagosome formation (Longatti et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned TBC1D14, which they designated
KIAA1322. The deduced protein contains 702 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected variable TBC1D14 expression in all adult and fetal tissues
examined, with highest expression in adult brain, lung, and ovary and in
most specific adult brain regions examined. Expression in fetal brain
was lower than that in adult brain.

Longatti et al. (2012) reported that full-length TBC1D14 contains 693
amino acids and has a C-terminal TRE2 (USP6; 604334)-yeast Bub2-CDC16
(603461) (TBC) domain. Fluorescence-tagged TBC1D14 colocalized with
Golgi and endosome markers in transfected HEK293A cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Longatti et al. (2012) identified TBC1D14 as a negative regulator of
starvation-induced autophagosome formation in HEK293A cells. In
serum-starved HEK293A cells, TBC1D14 directly bound the
autophagy-related kinase ULK1 (603168) and the recycling
endosome-related small GTPases RAB11A (605570) and RAB11B (604198), but
it did not appear to function as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for
RAB11. Overexpression of TBC1D14 caused tubulation of recycling
endosomes, inhibited autophagosome formation, and delayed recycling of
transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010)-associated endosomes back to the
plasma membrane. In contrast, knockdown of TBC1D14 via small interfering
RNA increased starvation-induced autophagy. Like TBC1D14 overexpression,
a dominant-negative RAB11A mutant defective for GTP binding also
inhibited starvation-induced autophagy. Longatti et al. (2012)
hypothesized that TBC1D14 inhibits autophagosome formation by
functioning as a non-GAP activator of RAB11.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the TBC1D14
gene to chromosome 4. Hartz (2012) mapped the TBC1D14 gene to chromosome
4p16.1 based on an alignment of the TBC1D14 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AB037743) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

610607	TITLE *610607 CYTOPLASMIC POLYADENYLATION ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 4; CPEB4
;;CPE-BINDING PROTEIN 4;;
KIAA1673
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) are located in the 3-prime
UTRs of hundreds of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, chromosome
segregation, and cell differentiation. CPEs function as docking sites
for CPE-binding proteins (CPEBs), which can either repress or activate
mRNA translation. CPEB4 activates mRNA translation by adding poly(A)
tails to target mRNAs (Ortiz-Zapater et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned CPEB4, which they designated
KIAA1673. The deduced 712-amino acid protein shares significant identity
with mouse Cpeb1 (607342). RT-PCR ELISA detected intermediate to high
expression of CPEB4 in all tissues examined, with highest levels in
brain, kidney, heart, and fetal liver. CPEB4 was expressed in all
specific adult brain regions examined, with highest levels in
cerebellum, spinal cord, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and substantia
nigra.

GENE FUNCTION

Ortiz-Zapater et al. (2012) observed increased expression of CPEB4 in
several human pancreatic tumor cell lines and in pancreatic tumor tissue
compared with a nontumorigenic pancreatic cell line and normal pancreas,
respectively. CPEB4 expression was also absent in normal astrocytes but
abundant in high-grade gliomas. Knockdown of CPEB4 expression in RWP-1
and Capan-1 human pancreatic tumor cells and in T98G glioblastoma cells
reduced invasiveness in vitro and malignancy and mortality following
injection into nude mice. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that
CPEB4 associated with a large number of CPE-containing mRNAs in RWP-1
cells, with most significant enrichment in mRNAs encoding general
translation factors and ribosomal proteins. One of these mRNAs, TPA
(PLAT; 173370), contains 2 CPEs in its 3-prime UTR. In normal pancreas,
TPA mRNA had a short poly(A) tail, but in pancreatic cancers, TPA mRNA
had a long poly(A) tail that was associated with upregulated TPA protein
expression. Downregulation of CPEB4 in RWP-1 cells resulted in TPA mRNAs
with shorter poly(A) tails and reduced TPA protein expression.
Ortiz-Zapater et al. (2012) concluded that TPA mRNA is translationally
activated in tumors through recruitment of CPEB4 to CPEs in its 3-prime
UTR.

MAPPING

Using a human-rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the CPEB4
gene to chromosome 5.

608953	TITLE *608953 TEKTIN 2; TEKT2
;;TEKTIN, TESTICULAR;;
TEKTIN-T;;
TEKTIN B1; TEKTB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TEKT2 and other members of the tektin protein family form filamentous
polymers in the walls of ciliary and flagellar microtubules (Iguchi et
al., 2002).

CLONING

Using mouse tektin-t to screen a human testis cDNA library, Iguchi et
al. (2002) cloned TEKT2, which they called tektin-t. The deduced
430-amino acid protein contains evolutionarily conserved tektin motifs
and 5 N-glycosylation sites. Human and mouse TEKT2 share 83% amino acid
identity. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.7-kb transcript expressed
strongly in testis and weakly in ovary. Western blot analysis of testis
showed a TEKT2 protein with an apparent molecular mass of 54 kD. In
sperm, a major protein of 56 kD, a minor protein of 46 kD, and a weakly
expressed protein of 54 kD were detected. The 56- and 54-kD proteins
bound concanavalin A, indicating that they were N-glycosylated, but the
46-kD protein did not. Immunostaining of human sperm revealed TEKT2
expressed in a discontinuous punctate pattern in the flagellum and in
the postacrosomal head region, with 2 positive spots in the tangential
view. A somewhat different staining pattern was found in mouse sperm.

By sequencing tryptic fragments of purified human TEKT2 protein,
followed by RT-PCR of testis mRNA and screening a testis cDNA library,
Wolkowicz et al. (2002) cloned TEKT2, which they called TEKB1. The
deduced 430-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 49.7
kD. TEKT2 contains a chaperonin signature motif, several
serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites, and 5
N-glycosylation sites. The central region of TEKT2 shares significant
similarity with sea urchin tektin B1, but the N and C termini differ.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.5-kb transcript only in testis. RNA
dot blot analysis detected highest TEKT2 expression in testis, followed
by adult trachea and fetal lung. Weaker expression was detected in
ovary, pituitary, adult lung, fetal brain, and fetal kidney. SAGE data
indicated that TEKT2 was also expressed in cerebellum and mammary gland
tumors. Immunofluorescence analysis did not detect TEKT2 on the sperm
surface. In permeabilized sperm, TEKT2 localized to the principal piece
of the sperm flagellum, suggesting an axonemal location. TEKT2 was also
found at the base of the sperm head in a location corresponding to the
basal body.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wolkowicz et al. (2002) determined that the TEKT2 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 4.2 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and genomic sequence analysis, Iguchi et
al. (2002) mapped the TEKT2 gene to chromosome 1pter-p32.3. Wolkowicz et
al. (2002) also mapped the TEKT2 gene to chromosome 1pter-p32.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (2004) found that Tekt2 null male mice were infertile, but
Tekt2 null female mice were fully fertile. Sperm morphology and function
were abnormal, with frequent bending of the sperm flagella and marked
defects in motility. In vitro fertilization assays showed that the
defective spermatozoa were able to fertilize eggs. However, electron
microscopic examination showed that the dynein inner arm structure was
disrupted. Homozygous mutant mice also had functionally defective
tracheal cilia with altered dynein arm morphology. Tanaka et al. (2004)
concluded that TEKT2 participates in dynein inner arm formation or
attachment and that the loss of TEKT2 results in impaired motility of
both flagella and cilia.

602313	TITLE *602313 OVO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG-LIKE, 1; OVOL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A critical role in Drosophila oogenesis and germline sex differentiation
is played by ovo, a female germline-specific nuclear protein.
Chidambaram et al. (1997) noted that homozygous ovo mutants result in
female germ cell degeneration and revertants of dominant ovo mutations
can result in shaven baby (svb) and lozenge-like (lzl) phenotypes that
affect cuticle (epidermal/locomotor) and eye (sensory) development,
respectively, suggesting a tight structural link between ovo and svb.
Human OVOL1, which contains an open reading frame with zinc finger
domains, is similar to Drosophila ovo and is conserved in C. elegans as
well. An EST database search suggested the presence of ovo-related
sequences in both the mouse and the human genome.

MAPPING

The human OVOL1 gene maps to 11q13, less than 200 kb proximal to the
oncogene SEA (165110) (Debelenko et al., 1997). Comparative mapping data
indicated that the mouse Ovol1 locus is located on MMU 19.

601529	TITLE *601529 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR SUBFAMILY 2, GROUP C, MEMBER 1; NR2C1
;;NUCLEAR HORMONE RECEPTOR TR2; TR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chang and Kokontis (1988) used an oligonucleotide probe based on the
zinc finger DNA-binding domain of steroid receptors to isolate a
putative steroid receptor, termed TR2, from a human testis cDNA library.
Subsequent studies (Chang et al., 1989) showed that several splice
variants of TR2 exist and the original TR2 clone was renamed TR2-5.
Northern blot analysis by Chang and Kokontis (1988) showed that TR2-5
produced a 2.5-kb transcript that was abundant in androgen-sensitive
organs, such as ventral prostate and seminal vesicle. Dot blot
hybridization indicated that TR2-5 mRNA levels increased after
castration of rats and that this increase was reversed by
5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone injection. Expression of TR2-5 resulted in a
52-kD protein.

Chang et al. (1989) described 4 splice variants of the TR2 gene, TR2-5,
TR2-7, TR2-9, and TR2-11, which encode proteins of 483, 184, 467, and
603 amino acids, respectively. All were isolated from human testis or
prostate cDNA libraries. The DNA-binding domains of the 4 variants are
identical and share 50 to 60% amino acid identity with other steroid
receptors. The TR2-7 receptor has no apparent hormone-binding region,
whereas the other 3 variants have the same hormone-binding region
followed by variant C termini. In vitro transcription and translation of
the TR2-11 receptor indicated that this receptor did not bind any known
steroids, suggesting to Chang et al. (1989) that this receptor could be
steroid independent or dependent on an unknown hormone. The authors
noted that the identity of the DNA-binding regions of these receptors
suggests that they regulate the same target gene(s), but the differences
in the C termini may allow them to bind different ligands or bind the
same ligand with differing affinities. By analogy to the splice variants
of the thyroid hormone receptor, the authors suggested that the
expression ratio of the TR2 splice variants could vary in a
tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific manner regulated at the
level of RNA splicing.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Lee et al. (1998) identified an
interaction between mouse Tr2 and Rip140 (NRIP1; 602490). By mutation
analysis, they determined that the LxxLL motifs of mouse Rip140
interacted with the activation function-2 region of Tr2.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments detected interaction between the 2
proteins in cell extracts. Rip140 repressed binding of Tr2 to target
DNA. In the presence of Rip140, Tr2 translocated into the nucleus.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NR2C1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP STS-H68838).

ANIMAL MODEL

Shyr et al. (2002) detected Tr2 expression in mice at 3 weeks of age,
and the expression was restricted mainly to spermatocytes and round
spermatids. They found that mice lacking Tr2 were viable with no serious
developmental defects. Male mice lacking Tr2 had functional testes,
including normal sperm number and motility, and both male and female
mice lacking Tr2 were fertile.

604790	TITLE *604790 TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 14; TAS2R14
;;T2R14;;
TASTE RECEPTOR, FAMILY B, MEMBER 1; TRB1
DESCRIPTION For background information on the TAS2R gene family, see 604791.

CLONING

Matsunami et al. (2000) used in silico methods to identify a family of
candidate taste receptors that are members of the G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR) superfamily and that are specifically expressed in taste
receptor cells. Using the TRB2 sequence to search the human chromosome
12 database, Matsunami et al. (2000) identified TRB1 and 7 other related
genes, all in the same contig. Two of these were pseudogenes. Matsunami
et al. (2000) identified the TRB7 gene (604796) in a contig assigned to
human chromosome 5p15, the location of PROP (171200), the genetic locus
that governs the ability of humans to taste 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil, a
bitter compound. Matsunami et al. (2000) also identified 5 TRB genes (1
a pseudogene) on 3 chromosome 7 contigs, 2 of which are assigned to
7q31-q32. All TRB genes have the 7 transmembrane domain structure
characteristic of GPCRs, but lack a long extracellular N-terminal domain
proposed to bind ligand, suggesting that they use a different mode of
ligand binding. Matsunami et al. (2000) concluded that the TRBs are
diverse in protein sequence, which is consistent with an ability to
detect a variety of tastants with very different chemical structures.

GENE FUNCTION

Kinnamon (2000) reviewed the role of taste receptors in taste
transduction.

Deshpande et al. (2010) found that bitter taste receptor agonists evoked
increased intracellular calcium in cultured human airway smooth muscle
(ASM) cells at levels comparable to GPCR agonists, such as bradykinin
and histamine. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected multiple TAS2R
transcripts in ASM cells, with highest expression of TAS2R10 (604791),
TAS2R14, and TAS2R31 (612669), intermediate expression of TAS2R5
(605062), TAS2R4 (604869), and TAS2R19 (613961), and detectable
expression of 11 other TAS2Rs, with results normalized for expression of
ADRB2 (109690). Expression of 8 other TAS2Rs and TAS1R1 (606225) and
TAS1R2 (606226) was undetectable. Using isolated intact mouse airways,
Deshpande et al. (2010) observed dose-dependent relaxation in response
to bitter taste receptor agonists, such as chloroquine, denatorium, and
quinine, after challenge with contracting agents, such as acetylcholine
or serotonin. Magnet twisting cytometry showed that isolated ASM cells
challenged with histamine relaxed after treatment with bitter taste
receptor agonists. Bitter taste receptor agonists were a more effective
treatment than albuterol in a mouse model of allergic airway
inflammation. Deshpande et al. (2010) proposed that agents that bind
bitter taste receptors and cause bronchodilation may provide an
alternative and/or supplement to beta agonist for the treatment of
asthma.

GENE FAMILY

Adler et al. (2000) identified members of a family of 40 to 80 human and
rodent GPCRs expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells of the tongue
and palate epithelia. These candidate taste receptors, which the authors
called T2Rs, are organized in the genome in clusters and are genetically
linked to loci that influence bitter perception in mice and humans. Each
T2R gene encodes a 7-transmembrane receptor protein. The amino acid
sequence identities between human and mouse T2Rs range from 46 to 67%.
The authors determined that a single taste receptor cell expresses a
large repertoire of T2Rs, suggesting that each cell may be capable of
recognizing multiple tastants. In situ hybridization demonstrated that
T2Rs are exclusively expressed in taste receptor cells that contain the
G protein subunit gustducin (139395), implying that they function as
gustducin-linked receptors.

Chandrashekar et al. (2006) reviewed the receptors and cells for
mammalian taste.

MAPPING

Matsunami et al. (2000) identified the TAS2R14 gene on chromosome 12p13.

Adler et al. (2000) identified T2R14, which is identical to the TRB1
gene reported by Matsunami et al. (2000), in a BAC clone from 12p13.

611123	TITLE *611123 EPHRIN RECEPTOR EphA10; EPHA10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ephrin receptors, the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs), and their ephrin ligands are important mediators of cell-cell
communication regulating cell attachment, shape, and mobility in
neuronal and epithelial cells (Aasheim et al., 2005). See 179610 for
additional background on Eph receptors and ephrins.

CLONING

By database analysis, Robinson et al. (2000) identified EPHA10. By
further database analysis and PCR of a testis cDNA library, Aasheim et
al. (2005) cloned EPHA10 and identified 3 isoforms. A 295-amino acid
soluble secreted Eph receptor (EphA10s) contains the Eph receptor
ligand-binding domain but lacks fibronectin III repeats. Full-length
EphA10 is composed of 1008 predicted amino acids, the first 283 of which
are identical to EphA10s, and its sequence predicts the canonic Eph
receptor structure containing an Eph ligand-binding domain, 2
fibronectin III repeats, an intracellular conserved kinase domain, and a
SAM domain. The third isoform, EphA10*, lacks the SAM domain. EPHA10
shares 91% amino acid identity with its mouse ortholog. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected expression in testis only. Binding
studies with EphA10s showed strong binding to EFNA3 (601381), EFNA4
(601380) and EFNA5 (601535), but weak binding to EFNB1 (300035) and
EFNB2 (600527).

GENE STRUCTURE

Aasheim et al. (2005) determined that the EPHA10 gene contains 17 exons.
Alternative splicing of exons 3 and 15 results in a soluble isoform
EphA10s, which contains only the first 3 exons, and an isoform lacking
the SAM domain, which they called EphA10*.

MAPPING

Aasheim et al. (2005) noted that the EPHA10 gene maps to chromosome
1p34.3.

605453	TITLE *605453 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 9; ABCB9
DESCRIPTION For background information on the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of
transporter proteins, see ABCA4 (601691). In addition to the 'full' ABC
transporters with 2 transmembrane domains and 2 nucleotide-binding
domains, there are 'half' proteins that contain only 1 of each domain
(e.g., ABCB1; 171050). Full transporters are usually found in the plasma
membrane, whereas half transporters are found in subcellular organelles.

By searching an EST database and screening a T-lymphoblast cDNA library,
Zhang et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA encoding ABCB9. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 766-amino acid ABCB9 protein has 10 potential
N-terminal transmembrane segments. ABCB9 shares 94% identity with the
rodent sequences and is approximately 39% identical to 2 human
endoplasmic reticulum half transporters, TAP1 (ABCB2; 170260) and TAP2
(ABCB3; 170261). RT-PCR and genomic sequence analysis established the
existence of a splice variant with a 129-bp deletion expressed in testis
and brain. Northern blot analysis detected low expression of a 3.7-kb
transcript in most tissues tested, with an additional 2.2-kb transcript
detected in tissues with relatively high expression, such as testis.
Western blot analysis showed expression of a 72-kD nonglycosylated
protein, significantly smaller than the predicted mass of 84.5 kD, that
was enriched in lysosomes. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of ABCB9 with the lysosomal proteins LAMP1 (153330) and
LAMP2 (309060). Immunohistochemical analysis detected ABCB9 expression
in Sertoli cells of rodent seminiferous tubules.

Allikmets et al. (1996) mapped an EST corresponding to the ABCB9 gene to
12q24.

180231	TITLE *180231 RETINOIC ACID-BINDING PROTEIN, CELLULAR, TYPE II; CRABP2
DESCRIPTION CRABP2 is highly expressed in human skin. Giguere et al. (1990) isolated
a cDNA encoding mouse Crabp-2 by a low stringency cloning strategy using
a probe from previously cloned CRABP1 cDNA (180230). MacGregor et al.
(1992) determined the genomic organization of the murine Crabp-2 gene
and performed a detailed analysis of its transcriptional unit. It was
shown to be approximately 4.6 kb long and divided into 4 exons in a
structure common to other members of the family of serum and cellular
retinoid-binding proteins. The chromosomal location of the Crabp-2 locus
was determined by interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived
from matings of C57BL/6J and M. spretus. Mapping results indicated that
the gene is located on mouse chromosome 2 linked to muscle nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor alpha-chain (Acra) and catalase-1 (Cas-1).
MacGregor et al. (1992) suggested that the human homolog is located on
2q or 11p. Elder et al. (1992) localized the CRABP2 gene to 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Localization was confirmed by
hybridization of a CRABP2 cDNA clone against a human/mouse hybrid cell
line containing a t(1;6)(q21;q13) translocation chromosome.

Flagiello et al. (1997) mapped CRABP2 to 1q21.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

610865	TITLE *610865 FELINE LEUKEMIA VIRUS SUBGROUP C RECEPTOR 2; FLVCR2
;;FLVCR-LIKE ON CHROMOSOME 14q; FLVCRL14q;;
CALCIUM CHELATE TRANSPORTER; CCT;;
CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 58; C14ORF58
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The FLVCR2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that belongs to the
major facilitator superfamily of secondary carriers that transport small
solutes in response to chemiosmotic ion gradients, such as calcium
(summary by Meyer et al., 2010).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to FLVCR1 (609144),
Lipovich et al. (2002) identified FLVCR2, which they called FLVCRL14q.
The deduced 527-amino acid protein contains 12 transmembrane domains and
the N- and C-terminal domains are cytoplasmic. A splice variant, in
which exon 1 is directly spliced to exon 9, encodes a putative 83-amino
acid protein that lacks all transmembrane domains.

Brasier et al. (2004) used a rat cDNA for a calcitonin (114130)-like
receptor to design 5-prime and 3-prime RACE primers, and they cloned 4
CCT transcripts from a human pituitary cDNA library. All transcripts
encode a deduced 526-amino acid protein that has an N-terminal hexad
repeat, 6 extracellular loops, and a C-terminal polyglutamate sequence.
EST analysis detected CCT in brain, heart, kidney, lung, placenta,
uterus, cervix, prostate, testis, germ cells, and whole fetus.
Immunofluorescence analysis of human pituitary detected CCT
predominantly in acidophils. Brasier et al. (2004) also identified 3 Cct
transcripts in mouse, which encode a deduced 551-amino acid protein. In
developing rat, Cct expression was restricted to osteoclasts,
chondrocytes, thyroid, pituitary, central nervous system, eye, liver,
kidney, and heart, and in mouse, intraplacental yolk sac showed Cct
expression. In mouse and rat kidney, Cct was expressed in the distal
portions of nephrons and collecting ducts.

By searching a database for sequences similar to FLVCR1, followed by PCR
of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line cDNA library, Brown et al. (2006) cloned
FLVCR2, which encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60
kD. It has 3 potential N-glycosylation motifs. Western blot analysis
detected FLVCR2 proteins at 55 kD and 40 kD. However, N-glycosidase
treatment did not alter the molecular mass of the larger protein.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Duffy et al. (2010) detected variable
FLVCR2 expression in all human tissues examined, with highest expression
in placenta, followed by adult and fetal liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lipovich et al. (2002) determined that the FLVCR2 gene contains 10
exons. The transcription start site is within a predicted CpG island,
and there are 2 polyadenylation signals at the 3-prime end.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Brasier et al. (2004) mapped the FLVCR2
gene to chromosome 14q24.3. They mapped the mouse Flvcr2 gene to
chromosome 12.

EVOLUTION

Lipovich et al. (2002) identified genes, including the FLVCR1-FLVCR2
paralogs, involved in a chromosome 1q/14q block duplication.
Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the duplication occurred early
within or immediately prior to the divergence of the vertebrate lineage,
between the protostome-deuterostome and amniote-amphibian divergences.

GENE FUNCTION

Infection of cells by the highly anemogenic feline leukemia virus
subgroup C (FeLV-C) is mediated by the binding of FeLV-C envelope
protein to FLVCR1. By assaying transfected mouse cells, Brown et al.
(2006) determined that, unlike FLVCR1, FLVCR2 does not bind FeLV-C
envelope protein. However, an asn463-to-asp mutation rendered FLVCR2
functional as an FeLV-C receptor.

Duffy et al. (2010) found that both human FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 bound
immobilized heme. Using hamster or human cell lines and Xenopus oocytes,
they confirmed that overexpression of human FLVCR1 resulted in heme
export, but in contrast, overexpression of FLVCR2 resulted in heme
import. Overexpression of FLVCR2 also rendered transfected cells more
sensitive to heme toxicity. Downregulation of FLVCR2 via small
interfering RNA inhibited heme import. Duffy et al. (2010) concluded
that FLVCR2 functions in heme import.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis, followed by candidate gene sequencing,
Meyer et al. (2010) identified a homozygous mutation in the FLVCR2 gene
(T430R; 610865.0001) in 5 fetuses with proliferative vasculopathy and
hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (PVHH; 225790) from 3
consanguineous Pakistani families. The disorder is also known as Fowler
syndrome. Two additional fetuses of Northern European origin with the
disorder were each found to be compound heterozygous for 2 mutations in
the FLVCR2 gene (610865.0002-610865.0005). Meyer et al. (2010) suggested
that the disorder may involve defects in proliferation and motility of
vascular endothelial cells in the brain, which are calcium-dependent
events.

Using exome sequencing, Lalonde et al. (2010) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FLVCR2 gene (610865.0006 and
610865.0007) in a fetus with proliferative vasculopathy and
hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome.

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by high-throughput sequencing of
7 families with Fowler syndrome, Thomas et al. (2010) identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations affecting the FLVCR2 gene
(see, e.g., Y134X; 610865.0008). Two of the families, of Turkish origin,
carried a large deletion. The patients and families had previously been
reported by Bessieres-Grattagliano et al. (2009).

In 5 fetuses with proliferative vasculopathy and
hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (PVHH; 225790) from 3
consanguineous Pakistani families, Meyer et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1289C-G transversion in exon 7 of the FLVCR2 gene, resulting
in a thr430-to-arg (T430R) substitution in a highly conserved region in
an intracellular loop of the protein. The mutation was not found in 646
control chromosomes.

In a fetus of Northern European origin with proliferative vasculopathy

identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FLVCR2 gene: a
6-bp deletion (329_334del) in exon 1, and a 1192C-G transversion in exon
6, resulting in a leu398-to-val (L398V; 610865.0003) substitution. The
6-bp deletion removed 3 conserved amino acids (asn110 to phe 112) and
introduced an isoleucine residue in the predicted first extracellular
loop (Asn110_Phe112delinsIle). The L398V substitution occurred in a
highly conserved residue in close proximity to transmembrane domain-9
(TM9). Neither mutation was found in at least 936 control chromosomes.
Lalonde et al. (2010) identified the same compound heterozygous
mutations in a second affected fetus from the family reported by Meyer
et al. (2010).

et al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
FLVCR2 gene: a 997C-T transition in exon 4, resulting in an
ala326-to-val (A326V) substitution at the end of the sixth transmembrane
domain (TM6), and a T-to-C transition in intron 7 (1341+2T-C;
610865.0007), predicted to result in the skipping of exon 7 or retention
of intron 7, disrupting the tenth transmembrane domain (TM10) and
potentially resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The parents had
previously lost a fetus with a similar phenotype, but no DNA sample was
available for study.

603805	TITLE *603805 TRANSGLUTAMINASE 5; TGM5
;;TRANSGLUTAMINASE X; TGX
DESCRIPTION Transglutaminases (EC 2.3.2.13) represent a family of enzymes capable of
stabilizing protein assemblies by gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine
crosslinks. For additional background information about
transglutaminases, see TGM1 (190195).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of keratinocyte mRNA with degenerate primers based on the
conserved transglutaminase active-site region, Aeschlimann et al. (1998)
isolated a partial cDNA encoding a novel member of this family, TGM5,
which they designated transglutaminase X (TGX). Using anchored PCR, the
authors cloned additional cDNAs encoding 2 TGX isoforms: a long
720-amino acid form and a short 638-amino acid form. The long form
contains an insert in the N-terminal region. Grenard et al. (2001)
identified the 2 isoforms as products of alternative gene splicing.
Aeschlimann et al. (1998) found that TGM5 contains the conserved
structural requirements for transglutaminase activity and calcium
binding. Overall, TGM5 shares 40%, 42%, 35%, and 31% protein sequence
identity with TGC (TGM2; 190196), TGE (TGM3; 600238), TGK (TGM1;
190195), and TGP (TGM4; 600585), respectively. Northern blot analysis
revealed that TGM5 is expressed as 2.2- and 2.8-kb mRNAs in foreskin
keratinocytes. By Northern dot blot analysis, Grenard et al. (2001)
found ubiquitous expression of TGM5, with highest levels in the female
reproductive system, skeletal muscle, and fetal tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Aeschlimann et al. (1998) found that expression of TGM5 increased
severalfold when keratinocyte cultures were induced to differentiate by
suspension or growth to postconfluency. They suggested that TGM5
contributes to the formation of the cornified cell envelope of
keratinocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grenard et al. (2001) determined that the TGM5 gene contains 13 exons
and spans about 35 kb. They identified a number of potential
transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region but no classic
TATA box.

MAPPING

By FISH, Grenard et al. (2001) mapped the TGM5 gene to chromosome
15q15.2. Using long-range genomic PCR, they found that TGM5 is part of a
tandemly arranged cluster of TGM genes, including EPB42 (177070) and
TGM7 (606776), in a 100-kb region. By radiation hybrid analysis, they
mapped the mouse Tgm5, Tgm7, and Epb42 genes in close proximity in a
region of syntenic homology on chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Peeling skin syndrome (270300) is an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by the continuous shedding of the outer layers of the
epidermis from birth and throughout life. In some families, an acral
form of peeling skin syndrome (609796) has been reported, in which skin
peeling is strictly limited to the dorsa of the hands and the feet;
ultrastructural and histologic analysis showed a level of blistering
high in the epidermis at the stratum granulosum-stratum corneum junction
(Shwayder et al., 1997; Hashimoto et al., 2000). Cassidy et al. (2005)
mapped a gene for acral peeling skin syndrome to 15q15.2 and identified
the same loss-of-function mutation in homozygous state in the TGM5 gene
in 2 unrelated families (603805.0001).

Cassidy et al. (2005) excluded the TGM5 locus in a large, consanguineous
kindred of Middle Eastern origin with more widespread peeling skin and,
in addition, failed to detect TGM5 mutations in 3 small, outbred
families with widespread peeling skin phenotypes. In all these families,
onset was in infancy and the phenotype was similar to the classic,
generalized form of peeling skin syndrome.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEELING SKIN SYNDROME, ACRAL TYPE
TGM5, GLY113CYS

Cassidy et al. (2005) described a homozygous missense mutation in exon 3
of the TGM5 gene in members of 2 unrelated families, 1 Dutch and 1
Scottish, who suffered from the acral form of peeling skin syndrome
(609796). A gly113-to-cys (G113C) mutation arose from a 337G-to-T
transversion. In fact, 2 homozygous missense mutations were found;
evidence was presented that one was a rare polymorphism and that G113C
was the pathogenic change.

600778	TITLE *600778 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE INHIBITOR 1B; CDKN1B
;;p27(KIP1);;
KIP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDKN1B, or p27(KIP1), is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that blocks
the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase upon differentiation signals or
cellular insult. CDKN1B also regulates cell motility and apoptosis
(summary by Cuesta et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using a cDNA probe amplified from the MV1Lu mink cell line to screen a
kidney cDNA library, Polyak et al. (1994) cloned human CDKN1B, which
they called KIP1. The deduced 198-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 22.3 kD. It has a 60-amino acid N-terminal domain that
shares 44% identity with the corresponding region of CIP1/WAF1 (CDKN1A;
116899). It also has a C-terminal bipartite nuclear localization signal
and a consensus CDC2 (CDK1; 116940) phosphorylation site. KIP1 shares
about 90% amino acid identity with mink and mouse Kip1, with highest
identity in the N-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of a 2.5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined.

Stegmaier et al. (1995) studied loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the
region 12p13-p12 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia; this chromosomal
region often shows deletion in such patients. In 15% of informative
patients, there was evidence of LOH of the TEL locus (600618) which was
not evident on cytogenetic analysis. Detailed examination of patients
with LOH showed that the critically deleted region included a second
candidate tumor suppressor gene, referred to by them as KIP1, which
encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor previously called p27
(Toyoshima and Hunter, 1994 and Polyak et al., 1994). Based on the STS
content of TEL-positive YACs, Stegmaier et al. (1995) reported that KIP1
and TEL were in close proximity.

GENE FUNCTION

Polyak et al. (1994) showed that recombinant mouse Kip1 inhibited
phosphorylation of histone H1 (see 142709) by human cyclin A (see CCNA1;
604036)-CDK2 (116953), cyclin E (CCNE1; 123837)-CDK2, and cyclin B1
(CCNB1; 123836)-CDK2 complexes. Addition of Kip1 also inhibited
phosphorylation of RB (614041) by cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin A-CDK2, and
cyclin D2 (CCND2; 123833)-CDK4 (123829). The isolated N-terminal domain
of Kip1 had similar inhibitory activity in these assays. Kip1 bound to
preactivated cyclin E-CDK2 complexes and prevented phosphorylation and
activation of CDK2 in A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Kip1 activity was
lowest in S phase in MV1Lu cells, and Kip1 overexpression inhibited S
phase entry. Kip1 mRNA content remained unchanged during the cell cycle,
suggesting that Kip1 activity was controlled at a posttranscriptional
level. Polyak et al. (1994) concluded that KIP1 can inhibit both CDK
activation and the kinase activity of assembled and activated
cyclin-CDK.

CDK activation requires association with cyclins and phosphorylation by
CAK (CCNH; 601953) and leads to cell proliferation. Inhibition of
cellular proliferation occurs upon association of CDK inhibitor (e.g.,
CDKN1B) with a cyclin-CDK complex. Sheaff et al. (1997) showed that
expression of CCNE1-CDK2 at physiologic levels of ATP resulted in
phosphorylation of CDKN1B at thr187, leading to elimination of CDKN1B
from the cell and progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase. At
low ATP levels, the inhibitory functions of CDKN1B were enhanced,
thereby arresting cell proliferation.

Apoptosis of human endothelial cells after growth factor deprivation is
associated with rapid and dramatic upregulation of cyclin A (see
604036)-associated CDK2 activity. Levkau et al. (1998) showed that in
apoptotic cells the carboxyl-termini of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and
CDKN1B are truncated by specific cleavage. The enzyme involved in this
cleavage is CASP3 (600636) and/or a CASP3-like caspase. After cleavage,
CDKN1A loses its nuclear localization sequence and exits the nucleus.
Cleavage of CDKN1A and CDKN1B resulted in a substantial reduction in
their association with nuclear cyclin-CDK2 complexes, leading to a
dramatic induction of CDK2 activity. Dominant-negative CDK2, as well as
a mutant CDKN1A resistant to caspase cleavage, partially suppressed
apoptosis. These data suggested that CDK2 activation, through
caspase-mediated cleavage of CDK inhibitors, may be instrumental in the
execution of apoptosis following caspase activation.

High levels of p27(KIP1), present in quiescent (G0) cells, have been
shown to decline upon mitogen induction (Sherr and Roberts, 1995).
Braun-Dullaeus et al. (1999) explored the role of p27(KIP1) and other
cell cycle proteins in mediating angiotensin II (see 106150)-induced
vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy or hyperplasia. Angiotensin II
treatment (100 nM) of quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells led to
upregulation of the cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1 (168461),
CDK2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (176740), and CDK1. Levels of
p27(KIP1), however, remained high, and the activation of the G1-phase
CDK2 was inhibited as the cells underwent hypertrophy. Angiotensin II
stimulated an increase in [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and the
percentage of S-phase cells in p27(KIP1) antisense oligodeoxynucleotide
(ODN)-transfected cells but not in control ODN transfected cells. The
authors concluded that angiotensin II stimulation of quiescent cells in
which p27(KIP1) levels are high results in hypertrophy but promotes
hyperplasia when levels of p27(KIP1) are low, as in the presence of
other growth factors.

Medema et al. (2000) demonstrated that p27(KIP1) is a major target of
AFX-like forkhead proteins. They demonstrated that AFX integrates
signals from PI3K/PKB (see AKT1; 164730) signaling and RAS (see
190020)/RAL (see 179551) signaling to regulate transcription of
p27(KIP1). They demonstrated that p27 -/- cells are significantly less
inhibited by AFX activity than their p27 +/+ counterparts.

Dijkers et al. (2002) showed that both cytokine withdrawal and Fkhrl1
(FOXO3A; 602681) activation induced apoptosis in mammalian cell lines
through a death receptor-independent pathway. This involved
transcriptional upregulation of p27(KIP1) and proapoptotic Bim (BCL2L11;
603827), loss of mitochondrial integrity, cytochrome c release, and
caspase activation. PKB protected cells from cytokine withdrawal-induced
apoptosis by inhibiting Fkhrl1, resulting in the maintenance of
mitochondrial integrity.

Peters and Ostrander (2001) commented on the work of Di Cristofano et
al. (2001), demonstrating how cooperation between Cdkn1b and Pten
(601728) contribute to suppression of prostate tumors. They gave a
useful tabulation of the cytogenetic location of 16 mapped prostate
cancer susceptibility loci and candidate genes.

Phosphorylation leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of CDKN1B.
Carrano et al. (1999) determined that SKP2 (601436) specifically
recognizes phosphorylated CDKN1B predominantly in S phase rather than in
G1 phase, and is the ubiquitin-protein ligase necessary for CDKN1B
ubiquitination.

Shin et al. (2002) demonstrated a novel mechanism of AKT-mediated
regulation of p27(KIP1). Blockade of HER2/NEU (164870) in tumor cells
inhibited AKT kinase activity and upregulated nuclear levels of
p27(KIP1). Recombinant AKT and AKT precipitated from tumor cells
phosphorylated wildtype p27 in vitro. P27 contains an AKT consensus
RXRXXT(157)D within its nuclear localization motif. Active
(myristoylated) AKT phosphorylated wildtype p27 in vivo but was unable
to phosphorylate a T157A-p27 mutant. Wildtype p27 localized in the
cytosol and nucleus, whereas the mutant p27 localized exclusively in the
nucleus and was resistant to nuclear exclusion by AKT. Expression of
phosphorylated AKT in primary human breast cancers statistically
correlated with the expression of p27 in tumor cytosol. Shin et al.
(2002) concluded that AKT may contribute to tumor cell proliferation by
phosphorylation and cytosolic retention of p27, thus relieving CDK2 from
p27-induced inhibition.

Liang et al. (2002) demonstrated that AKT phosphorylates p27, impairs
the nuclear import of p27, and opposes cytokine-mediated G1 arrest. In
cells transfected with constitutively active AKT, wildtype p27
mislocalized to the cytoplasm, but mutant p27 was nuclear. In cells with
activated AKT, wildtype p27 failed to cause G1 arrest, while the
antiproliferative effect of the mutant p27 was not impaired. Cytoplasm
p27 was seen in 41% (52 of 128) primary human breast cancers in
conjunction with AKT activation and was correlated with a poor patient
prognosis. Liang et al. (2002) concluded that their data showed a novel
mechanism whereby AKT impairs p27 function that is associated with an
aggressive phenotype in human breast cancer.

Viglietto et al. (2002) independently demonstrated that AKT regulates
cell proliferation in breast cancer cells by preventing
p27(KIP1)-mediated growth arrest. They also showed that threonine at
position 157 is an AKT phosphorylation site and causes retention of
p27(KIP1) in the cytoplasm, precluding p27(KIP1)-induced G1 arrest.

Gopfert et al. (2003) analyzed fragments of the p27 transcript for their
contribution to cell cycle-regulated translation. An element in the p27
5-prime UTR rendered reporter translation cell cycle-sensitive with
maximal translation in G1-arrested cells. The 114-bp element contained a
G/C-rich hairpin domain that was predicted to form multiple stable
stemloops and also overlapped with a small upstream open reading frame
(ORF). Both structures contributed to cell cycle-regulated translation.
The upstream ORF could be translated in vitro, and its sequence and
position were evolutionarily conserved in mouse and chicken. The precise
sequence or length of the upstream ORF-encoded peptide were not
important for p27 translation, suggesting that ribosomal recruitment to
its initiation codon, rather than the translation product itself,
contributes to the regulation.

Using NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Kamura
et al. (2004) found that Skp2 was the major ubiquitin ligase involved in
ubiquitination of nuclear p27(KIP1) at the S and G2 phases, and that a
complex made up of Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472) and Kpc2 (UBAC1; 608129)
ubiquitinated cytoplasmic p27(KIP1) at G1 phase. Cytoplasmic degradation
of p27(KIP1) required p27(KIP1) nuclear export by Crm1 (XPO1; 602559).

The inverse relationship between proliferation and differentiation in
osteoblasts has been well documented. Thomas et al. (2004) found that
Runx2 (600211), a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation in
mammalian cells, was disrupted in 6 of 7 mammalian osteosarcoma cell
lines. Immunohistochemical analysis of human osteosarcomas indicated
that expression of p27(KIP1) was also lost as tumors lost osteogenic
differentiation. Thomas et al. (2004) found that ectopic expression of
Runx2 induced growth arrest through p27(KIP1)-induced inhibition of
S-phase cyclin complexes, followed by dephosphorylation of RB1 (614041)
and G1 cell cycle arrest. They concluded that RUNX2 establishes a
terminally differentiated state in osteoblasts through RB1- and
p27(KIP1)-dependent mechanisms that are disrupted in osteosarcomas.

White et al. (2006) showed that postmitotic supporting cells purified
from the postnatal mouse cochlea retain the ability to divide and
trans-differentiate into new hair cells in culture. Furthermore, they
demonstrated that age-dependent changes in supporting cell proliferative
capacity are due in part to changes in the ability to downregulate
p27(Kip1). White et al. (2006) concluded that postnatal mammalian
supporting cells are potential targets for therapeutic manipulation.

Grimmler et al. (2007) found that a conserved tyrosine (Y88) in the
CDK-inhibitory domain of human p27 could be phosphorylated by the Src
family kinase LYN (165120) and the oncogene product BCR-ABL (see
189980). Phosphorylation of Y88 did not prevent binding of p27 to cyclin
A/CDK2, but it caused phosphorylated Y88 and the inhibitory domain of
p27 to be ejected from the CDK2 active site, restoring partial CDK
activity. This allowed Y88-phosphorylated p27 to be efficiently
phosphorylated on thr187 by CDK2, which in turn promoted its
SCF-SKP2-dependent degradation.

Chu et al. (2007) showed that the oncogenic kinase SRC (190090)
phosphorylated human p27 at Y74 and Y88. SRC inhibitors increased
cellular p27 stability, whereas SRC overexpression accelerated p27
proteolysis. SRC-phosphorylated p27 inhibited cyclin E/CDK2 poorly in
vitro, and SRC transfection reduced p27/cyclin E/CDK2 complexes.
SRC-activated human breast cancer cell lines exhibited reduced p27, and
there was a correlation between SRC activation and reduced nuclear p27
in 482 primary human breast cancers. In tamoxifen-resistant breast
cancer cell lines, SRC inhibition increased p27 levels and restored
tamoxifen sensitivity. Chu et al. (2007) concluded that SRC-mediated
phosphorylation of p27 reduces its inhibitory action on cyclin E/CDK2,
facilitating subsequent p27 proteolysis.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of an adult human heart cDNA library, Hauck
et al. (2008) showed that p27 interacted with the C-terminal region of
casein kinase-2 (CK2)-alpha-prime (CSNK2A2; 115442). Immunocytochemical
analysis of primary rat ventricular cardiomyocytes revealed
colocalization of p27 with CK2-alpha-prime. Angiotensin II, a potent
inducer of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, induced proteasomal degradation of
p27 in primary rat cardiomyocytes through CK2-alpha-prime-dependent
phosphorylation of p27 on ser83 and thr187, which are conserved in
humans and rodents. Conversely, unphosphorylated p27 potently inhibited
CK2-alpha-prime. Hauck et al. (2008) concluded that downregulation of
p27 by CK2-alpha-prime is necessary for development of agonist- and
stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that bind to complementary
sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs and inhibit their
expression. Kedde et al. (2007) showed that the expression of DND1
(609385), an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein, counteracted
the inhibitory effect of several miRNAs in human cells and in primordial
germ cells of zebrafish by preventing the association of miRNAs with
their target mRNAs. Kedde et al. (2007) detailed the effect of DND1 on
the downregulation of p27 mRNA by miR221 (MIRN221; 300568) in human
cells. Introduction of DND1 abolished the interaction between miR221 and
the 3-prime UTR of p27 mRNA and countered the downregulation of p27
expression by miR221. DND1 bound a uridine-rich region in the 3-prime
UTR of p27 mRNA that is near the miR221-binding site and prevented
miR221 binding. At least 1 of the 2 uridine-rich regions in the p27
3-prime UTR and the RNA-binding domain of DND1 were required to rescue
p27 expression.

Cuesta et al. (2009) found that translation of p27 in HeLa cells and
HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells was cap dependent. Translation
via a proposed internal ribosome entry site appeared to be artifactual,
resulting from the presence of cryptic promoters in the 5-prime UTR.
Cuesta et al. (2009) showed that the dramatic increase in p27 following
phorbol ester treatment was not due to increased mRNA levels, but rather
to downregulation of MIR181A (see 612742) and relief of
MIR181A-dependent translational repression. The 3-prime UTR of p27 mRNA
contains 2 possible MIR181A-binding sites, 1 of which overlaps the
MIR221-binding site. Both MIR181A-binding sites could repress p27
translation either individually or synergistically.

Lin et al. (2010) showed that although Skp2 inactivation on its own does
not induce cellular senescence, aberrant protooncogenic signals as well
as inactivation of tumor suppressor genes do trigger a potent,
tumor-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2.
Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic stress-driven senescence
neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf) (see 600160)-p53 (191170)
pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Aft4 (604064), p27, and
p21 (116899). Lin et al. (2010) further demonstrated that genetic Skp2
inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in
which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex
inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten (601728)-deficient
cells and tumor regression in preclinical studies. Lin et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings provided proof-of-principle evidence that
pharmacologic inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for
cancer prevention and therapy.

MAPPING

Baens et al. (1995) characterized 117 cDNAs isolated by direct cDNA
selection using pools of human chromosome 12p cosmids. Among these, 3
matched previously determined cDNA sequences, including the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor referred to as KIP1. STSs were
developed for all cosmids. Regional assignment of the STSs by PCR
analysis with somatic cell hybrids and fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) showed that the loci mapped to 12p13. Martin et al.
(1995) mapped this gene, which they referred to as CDKN4, to 12p12.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By PCR-based screening of genomic
YAC clones of the CEPH library, they isolated 7 containing the KIP1
gene. In 4 of these YACs, they found a common STS, D12S358, and 1 of the
4 YACs also contained an additional STS, D12S320, which had been located
4 cM apart from D12S358 on the Genethon genetic map. Most of the YACs
containing the KIP1 gene had been assigned to chromosome 12 from
hybridization data of inter-Alu PCR products from somatic hybrids.

By FISH, Saito et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Kip gene to chromosome
7D3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, Type IV

In a 48-year-old Caucasian female with primary hyperparathyroidism and a
history of pituitary adenoma, consistent with multiple endocrine
neoplasia type IV (MEN4; 610755), Pellegata et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous nonsense mutation in the CDKN1B gene (600778.0001). The
mutation was also identified in her older sister who had renal
angiomyolipoma, her youngest sister, and that sister's teenage daughter,
who reported no symptoms but did not undergo thorough examination. No
mutations in the MEN1 gene (613733) were found in the proband or her
older sister.

- Other Disease Associations

Chang et al. (2004) analyzed the CDKN1B gene in 188 families with
hereditary prostate cancer (see 176807) and found a significant
association between the SNP -79C/T (dbSNP rs34330) and prostate cancer.
The -79C allele was overtransmitted from parents to affected offspring,
an association that was observed primarily in offspring whose age at
diagnosis was less than 65 years. Chang et al. (2004) suggested that
germline variants of this gene play a role in prostate cancer
susceptibility.

Grey et al. (2013) found biallelic loss of CDKN1B gene expression in a
boy with overgrowth and severe neurodevelopmental delay with autism. He
also had left-sided strabismus, maldescended testes, and challenging
behavior. Array CGH identified a heterozygous, approximately 108-kb
deletion on chromosome 12p13 encompassing the 5-prime end of CDKN1B,
APOLD1 (612456), and the 5-prime untranslated region of DDX47 (615428).
The patient's unaffected mother also carried this deletion. Both
individuals had decreased CDKN1B mRNA expression, but only the boy had
decreased protein levels. Sanger sequencing showed that the proband also
had a de novo heterozygous -73G-A transition in the promoter of the
CDKN1B gene that was demonstrated to result in significantly decreased
protein expression. Grey et al. (2013) postulated that the neurologic
phenotype in the proband fit a recessive model of inheritance and was
due to decreased expression of the CDKN1B below a threshold necessary to
ensure normal neurodevelopment. The findings were also consistent with a
mouse knockout model that has gigantism and hyperplasia of multiple
organs (Fero et al., 1996).

ANIMAL MODEL

Fero et al. (1996) found that targeted disruption of the murine
p27(Kip1) gene caused a gene dose-dependent increase in animal size
without other gross morphologic abnormalities. All tissues were enlarged
and contained more cells, although endocrine abnormalities were not
evident. Thymic hyperplasia was associated with increased T-lymphocyte
proliferation, and T cells showed enhanced IL2 (147680) responsiveness
in vitro. Thus, p27 deficiency may cause a cell-autonomous defect
resulting in enhanced proliferation in response to mitogens. In the
spleen, the absence of p27 selectively enhanced proliferation of
hematopoietic progenitor cells. That p27 and Rb function in the same
regulatory pathway was suggested by the finding that p27 deletion, like
deletion of the Rb gene, uniquely caused neoplastic growth of the
pituitary pars intermedia. The absence of p27 also caused an ovulatory
defect and female sterility. Maturation of second ovarian follicles into
corpora lutea, which express high levels of p27, was markedly impaired.

Zindy et al. (1999) generated mice with targeted deletions of both the
Ink4d (600927) and Kip1 genes. They found that terminally
differentiated, postmitotic neurons in these mice reentered the cell
cycle, divided, and underwent apoptosis. Zindy et al. (1999) noted that
when either Ink4d or Kip1 alone are deleted, the postmitotic state is
maintained, suggesting a redundant role for these genes in mature
neurons.

Mitsuhashi et al. (2001) described a mouse model in which p27(Kip1)
transgene expression was spatially restricted to the central nervous
system neuroepithelium and temporally controlled with doxycycline.
Transgene-specific transcripts were detectable within 6 hours of
doxycycline administration, and maximum nonlethal expression was
approached within 12 hours. After 18 to 26 hours of transgene
expression, the G1 phase of the cell cycle was estimated to increase
from 9 to 13 hours in the neocortical neuroepithelium, the maximum G1
phase length attainable in this proliferative population in normal mice.
Thus, the data established a direct link between p27(Kip1) and control
of G1 phase length in the mammalian central nervous system and unveiled
intrinsic mechanisms that constrain the G1 phase length to a putative
physiologic maximum despite ongoing p27(Kip1) transgene expression.

Phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) on threonine-187 by CDK2 is thought to
initiate the major pathway for p27 proteolysis. To test the importance
of this pathway critically in vivo, Malek et al. (2001) replaced the
murine p27 gene with one that encoded alanine instead of threonine at
position 187. Malek et al. (2001) demonstrated that cells expressing p27
with the T187A change were unable to downregulate p27 during the S and
G2 phases of the cell cycle, but that this had a surprisingly modest
effect on cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Malek et al.
(2001) demonstrated a second proteolytic pathway for controlling p27,
one that is activated by mitogens and degrades p27 exclusively during
G1.

Uchida et al. (2005) generated mice expressing human CDKN1B under the
control of the promoter of the rat insulin gene and observed that
increased expression of p27 in pancreatic beta cells induced severe
diabetes as a result of inhibition of beta-cell proliferation. In mice
lacking either insulin receptor substrate-2 (Irs2 -/-; see 600797) or
the long form of the leptin receptor (Lepr -/-; see 601007), they found
progressive accumulation of p27 in the nucleus of beta cells. Deletion
of Cdkn1b ameliorated hyperglycemia in these mouse models of type II
diabetes (125853) by increasing islet mass and maintaining compensatory
hyperinsulinemia, which the authors attributed predominantly to
stimulation of pancreatic beta-cell proliferation. Uchida et al. (2005)
concluded that p27 contributes to beta-cell failure in the development
of type II diabetes in Irs2 -/- and Lepr -/- (db/db) mice.

Wolfraim and Letterio (2005) found increased numbers of both Cd4
(186940)-positive and Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells in
p27(Kip1)-deficient mice. However, there was a greater increase in the
numbers of Cd8-positive T cells, resulting in a lower Cd4:Cd8 ratio, due
in part to enhanced proliferation of naive Cd8-positive T cells, but not
naive Cd4-positive T cells, under conditions of limiting Cd28
(186760)-mediated costimulation.

Nmyc (164840) promotes rapid cell division of granule neuron progenitors
(GNPs) in mice, and its conditional loss during embryonic cerebellar
development results in severe GNP deficiency, perturbs foliation, and
leads to reduced cerebellar mass. Since loss of Nmyc triggers precocious
expression of Kip1 and Ink4c (CDKN2C; 603369) in the cerebellar
primordium, Zindy et al. (2006) disrupted Kip1 and Ink4c in Nmyc-null
cerebella and found that this partially rescued GNP cell proliferation
and cerebellar foliation. They concluded that expression of NMYC and
concomitant downregulation of INK4C and KIP1 contribute to the proper
development of the cerebellum.

Sharov et al. (2006) showed that inhibition of BMP (see BMP1, 112264)
signaling in mouse keratinocytes altered the development of hair
follicles. Microarray and real-time PCR analysis of laser-captured hair
matrix cells showed a strong decrease in the expression of p27(Kip1) and
increased expression of selected cyclins in the transgenic mice.
p27(Kip1) knockout mice showed a similar increase in anagen hair
follicles associated with increased cell proliferation in hair bulbs.
Alternatively, activation of BMP signaling in human keratinocytes
induced growth arrest and stimulated p27(Kip1) expression. Sharov et al.
(2006) concluded that p27(Kip1) mediates the effects of BMP signaling on
hair follicle size.

Fritz et al. (2002) described a multiple endocrine neoplasia-like
autosomal recessive disorder in the rat. Animals exhibiting the mutant
phenotype developed multiple neuroendocrine malignancies within the
first year of life, including bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma,
multiple extraadrenal pheochromocytoma, bilateral medullary thyroid cell
neoplasia, bilateral parathyroid hyperplasia, and pituitary adenoma. The
appearance of neoplastic disease was preceded by the development of
bilateral juvenile cataracts. Although the spectrum of affected tissues
was reminiscent of human forms of MEN, no germline mutations were
detected in the RET (164761) or MEN1 (613733) genes. Segregation studies
in F1 and F2 crosses yielded frequencies of affected animals consistent
with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.

In rats with an MEN-like syndrome (Menx), with phenotypic overlap of
MEN1 (131100) and MEN2A (171400), Pellegata et al. (2006) performed
linkage analysis and identified a locus in a 4-Mb segment on rat
chromosome 4, which includes the Cdkn1b gene. Sequencing revealed a
homozygous frameshift mutation in the Cdkn1b gene resulting in a
dramatic reduction of p27(Kip1) protein.

Besson et al. (2007) generated knockin mice expressing a mutant p27
protein, called p27(CK-), that was unable to interact with cyclins and
cyclin-dependent kinases. In contrast to complete deletion of the Cdkn1b
gene, which causes spontaneous tumors only in pituitary, p27(CK-)
dominantly caused hyperplastic lesions and tumors in multiple organs.
The high incidence of spontaneous tumors in lung and retina was
associated with amplification of stem/progenitor cell populations.

Karlas et al. (2010) reported the discovery of 287 human host cell
genes, including CDKN1B, influencing influenza A virus replication in a
genomewide RNA interference screen. Using an independent assay, Karlas
et al. (2010) confirmed 168 hits (59%) inhibiting either the endemic
HIN1 (119 hits) or the pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A
virus strains, with an overlap of 60%. CDKN1B inhibited both viral
strains. Furthermore, H1N1 virus-infected p27-null mice accumulated
significantly lower viral titers in the lung, providing in vivo evidence
for the importance of this gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA, TYPE IV
CDKN1B, TRP76TER

In a 48-year-old Caucasian female with primary hyperparathyroidism and a
history of pituitary adenoma (MEN4; 610755), Pellegata et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 692G-A transition in the CDKN1B gene,
resulting in a trp76-to-ter (W76X) substitution. The mutation was also
identified in her older sister who had renal angiomyolipoma, her
youngest sister, and that sister's teenaged daughter, who reported no
symptoms but did not undergo thorough examination. The mutation was not
found in 380 unrelated healthy controls. Molecular and
immunohistochemical analysis of the renal angiomyolipoma showed that it
retained the CDKN1B wildtype allele and demonstrated RNA expression but
showed no p27 protein staining.

604249	TITLE *604249 RETICULON 3; RTN3
;;NEUROENDOCRINE-SPECIFIC PROTEIN-LIKE 2; NSPL2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The reticulons are a group of highly conserved genes with preferential
expression in neuroendocrine tissues (see, e.g., RTN1; 600865).

CLONING

During a subtraction cloning between macula and peripheral retina,
Moreira et al. (1999) isolated a novel member of the reticulon gene
family, which they designated reticulon-3. The mRNA for RTN3 was
approximately 3-fold more abundant in macula than in peripheral retina.
The 2,527-bp cDNA encodes a predicted 236-amino acid protein that shows
strong sequence similarity with other members of the RTN gene family
(see, e.g., 600865). Northern blot analysis showed that RTN3 is widely
expressed in human tissues, with highest expression in the brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moreira et al. (1999) determined that the RTN3 gene contains 7 exons and
spans more than 15 kb.

MAPPING

By use of somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid panels, Moreira et
al. (1999) mapped the RTN3 gene to 11q13, between markers D11S4535 and
D11S4627. Southern blot analysis identified the presence of at least one
pseudogene that was subsequently localized to chromosome 4.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (2004) found that BACE1 (604252) coimmunoprecipitated with
members of the reticulon family of proteins: RTN1, RTN2 (603183), RTN3,
and RTN4 (604475). BACE1 colocalized with RTN3 in neurons of human brain
gray matter, and with RTN4 in oligodendrocytes in white matter.
Overexpression of RTN3 in vitro inhibited BACE1 activity and decreased
amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760) processing. The findings
suggested that reticulon proteins are negative modulators of BACE1
activity, and that RTN3 specifically blocks access of BACE1 to APP
within neurons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Windpassinger et al. (2003) excluded RTN3 as the gene mutant in Silver
spastic paraplegia syndrome (270685), the locus for which maps to
11q12-q14, as no mutations in RTN3 were found on sequence analysis of at
least 2 affected individuals from each of 4 different families and 1
healthy control.

607860	TITLE *607860 YY1 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; YY1AP1
;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Paris and Williams (2000) identified several genes, including CDHR5,
which they called MUCDHL, by constructing a physical map of chromosome
11p15.5. They found that MUCDHL contains nonpolymorphic tandem repeats
similar to mucin proteins and a consensus calcium-binding motif found in
all cadherins.

MAPPING

Paris and Williams (2000) constructed a physical map of chromosome
11p15.5 and located the CDHR5 gene less than 250 kb telomeric to a mucin
gene cluster.

126063	TITLE *126063 DIHYDROLIPOAMIDE S-SUCCINYLTRANSFERASE; DLST
;;ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATE DEHYDROGENASE COMPLEX, E2 COMPONENT OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and branched chain
alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex) are a family of multienzyme
complexes. They are localized in mitochondria and catalyze the oxidative
decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids. These 3 alpha-keto acid
dehydrogenase complexes are composed of 3 different enzymes: alpha-keto
acid dehydrogenase (E1; 300502), dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2),
and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3; 238331). Dihydrolipoamide
succinyltransferase, which is a component of the structural core of the
alpha-keto glutarate dehydrogenase complex, was studied by Nakano et al.
(1993), who isolated a cDNA from a human fibroblast cDNA library. Amino
acid sequence analysis supported their previous observation (Nakano et
al., 1993) that human dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase lacks a
sequence motif for an E1 and/or E3 binding site. By Northern blot
analysis, Ali et al. (1994) detected ubiquitous expression of DLST in
peripheral tissues and brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nakano et al. (1993) found that the DLST gene contains 3 exons and 4
introns and that the nucleotide sequence at the 5-prime donor and
3-prime acceptor sites of all introns conformed to the gt-ag rule.

GENE FUNCTION

DLST is the E2 component of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex. In contrast to the E2 components of the other 2 alpha-keto acid
dehydrogenase complexes, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (see 300502)
and the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (see
608348), the alpha-KGDC E2 has a unique structure consisting of 2
domains and lacking a sequence motif of an E3 and/or E1 binding site
(Patel and Harris, 1995).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nakano et al. (1993) found that
the DLST gene is located on 14q24.2-q24.3 and that a related sequence is
located on 1p31. The gene for the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase of
the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (DBT; 248610),
the site of the mutation in type 2 maple syrup urine disease (see
248600), is located on 1p31. Nakano et al. (1993) mentioned the
possibility that mutation of the DLST gene may be a cause of familial
Alzheimer disease that maps to 14q24.3 (AD3; 607822). Ali et al. (1994)
mapped the DLST gene (symbolized by them KGDHC) to 14q24.3 by isotopic
in situ hybridization. The cDNA they used also cross-hybridized to an
apparent E2k pseudogene on 1p31.

605328	TITLE *605328 KRUPPEL-LIKE FACTOR 13; KLF13
;;RANTES FACTOR OF LATE-ACTIVATED T LYMPHOCYTES 1; RFLAT1;;
FKLF2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLF13 belongs to a family of transcription factors that contain 3
classical zinc finger DNA-binding domains consisting of a zinc atom
tetrahedrally coordinated by 2 cysteines and 2 histidines (C2H2 motif).
These transcription factors bind to GC-rich sequences and related GT and
CACCC boxes (Scohy et al., 2000).

CLONING

Although many genes are induced early after T-cell activation, a few,
like RANTES (187011), are induced at the T-cell differentiation stage.
The A promoter region of the RANTES gene binds REL (e.g., RELA, 164014)
as well as non-REL proteins. Using Southwestern blotting of nuclear
extracts of activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) probed with
oligonucleotides from the RANTES promoter A and B sites, Song et al.
(1999) identified proteins detected only at late activation stages. By
screening a day 5 activated PBL library with a 3-tandem A site probe,
Song et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding the KLF13 protein, which
they termed RFLAT (RANTES factor of late-activated T lymphocytes). The
deduced 228-amino acid protein contains 3 contiguous TFIIIA (GTF3A;
600860)-like C-terminal DNA-binding zinc finger motifs, which are 65 to
73% homologous to SP1 (189906), SP3 (601804), and BTEB (602902). Its N
terminus, which is preceded by a stretch rich in basic amino acids, is
rich in proline, serine, and alanine residues. SDS-PAGE and Western blot
analysis indicated that KLF13 is expressed as a phosphorylated 38-kD
protein. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of 7.5-
and 5.0-kb transcripts, with greatest abundance in PBL and thymus.
Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis showed that KLF13 is
localized in the nucleus.

Using degenerate PCR primers based on the sequence for KLF1 (600599),
Asano et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA from fetal liver erythroid cells that
encodes KLF13, which they termed FKLF2 based on its structural
similarity to FKLF (TIEG2; 603301). By Northern blot analysis, they
showed that KLF13 was expressed as 4.4- and 1.5-kb transcripts in the
bone marrow and striated muscles but not in 12 other human tissues
analyzed.

By searching for sequences related to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain
of SP1, followed by screening a fetal mouse liver cDNA library, Scohy et
al. (2000) cloned mouse Klf13. Like the human protein, mouse Klf13
encodes a deduced 288-amino acid protein. Mouse and human KLF13 share
98% amino acid identity through the zinc finger domains and 87% identity
overall. Residues within each of the 3 zinc fingers that establish
specific contacts with DNA are completely conserved in KLF13, suggesting
that both mouse and human KLF13 recognize a classical GC box. Klf13 also
contains an N-terminal region rich in proline and alanine. RT-PCR
analysis revealed Klf13 expression in all mouse tissues examined, with
lowest levels in testis and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Gelshift binding analysis by Song et al. (1999) demonstrated that KLF13
binds to the A and A/B RANTES promoter binding sites, but not the B site
alone, and that NFKB (164011) also binds to these sites. Northern and
Western blot analysis demonstrated that while KLF13 mRNA is detectable
at constant steady state levels in resting and activated T cells, KLF13
protein appears only late after activation. Luciferase reporter assays
showed that KLF13 can transactivate the RANTES gene; whereas KLF13 is
the dominant transactivator of RANTES in T-cells, RELA is the dominant
transactivator in fibroblasts.

Luciferase reporter assays by Asano et al. (2000) showed that KLF13
activates predominantly the gamma- (HBG1; 142200) and, to a lesser
degree, the epsilon- (HBE1; 142100) and beta- (HBB; 141900) globin gene
promoters. They found that KLF13 is involved in activation of
transcription of a wide variety of genes in the cells of erythroid
lineage, including GATA1 (305371), glycophorin B (111740),
ferrochelatase (612386), porphobilinogen deaminase (HMBS; 609806), and
5-aminolevulinate synthase (125290).

MAPPING

Scott (2000) mapped the KLF13 gene to chromosome 15 based on sequence
similarity between the KLF13 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF150628) and a
chromosome 15 clone (GenBank GENBANK AC009873). By somatic cell hybrid
analysis, Scohy et al. (2000) mapped the KLF13 gene to chromosome 15.
Suske et al. (2005) stated that the human KLF13 gene maps to chromosome
15q13.2, and the mouse Klf13 gene to chromosome 7C.

604695	TITLE *604695 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR-LIKE 3; ARL3
;;ARFL3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are low molecular weight GTP-binding
proteins belonging to the RAS superfamily; see ARF1 (103180). By
sequence analysis of clones randomly isolated from a fetal brain cDNA
library, Cavenagh et al. (1994) obtained an EST encoding ARL3. The
predicted 182-amino acid ARL3 protein shares 97% amino acid identity
with rat Arl3 and 43% identity with human ARF1. Like the ARFs, ARL3 has
a glycine at position 2, the site of N myristoylation, and lacks
cysteine residues near the C terminus, which are found in other members
of the RAS family. Northern blot analysis detected a 1-kb ARL3
transcript in all tissues tested, with highest expression in heart and
lung, and lower expression in brain, liver, kidney, ovary, and testis. A
5.5-kb transcript was also detected in most tissues, with highest
expression in brain. Immunoblot analysis detected ARL3 in human tumor
cell lines but not in normal rodent cells. Although ARL3 binds GTP, it
is devoid of activity in the cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation of
Gs (see 139320), and is therefore classified as an ARF-like protein.

By immunohistochemical analysis of several mammalian cell lines,
including human, Zhou et al. (2006) found that both ARL2 (601175) and
ARL3 were expressed at centrosomes, in cytoplasmic punctae, and in the
nucleus. ARL3 was also expressed at Golgi membranes and at the mitotic
spindle, particularly in metaphase and anaphase. Both ARL2 and ARL3
localized to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle, and their expression
in other structures was cell type specific.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Kim (1998) mapped
the ARL3 gene to chromosome 10q23.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa-2 gene (RP2; 300757) cause a
severe form of X-linked retinal degeneration (see 312600). RP2 is a
plasma membrane-associated protein which shares homology with
tubulin-specific chaperone cofactor C (TBCC; 602971). The RP2 protein,
like cofactor C, stimulates the GTPase activity of tubulin in
combination with cofactor D. RP2 has also been shown to interact with
ARL3 in a nucleotide- and myristoylation-dependent manner. Grayson et
al. (2002) examined the relationship between RP2, cofactor C, and ARL3
in patient-derived cell lines and in the retina. In human retina, RP2
was localized to the plasma membrane in both rod and cone
photoreceptors, extending from the outer segment through the inner
segment to the synaptic terminals. In contrast, cofactor C and ARL3
localized predominantly to the photoreceptor-connecting cilium in rod
and cone photoreceptors. Cofactor C was cytoplasmic in distribution,
whereas ARL3 localized to other microtubule structures within all cells.
Grayson et al. (2002) suggested that RP2 may function in concert with
ARL3 to link the cell membrane with the cytoskeleton in photoreceptors
as part of the cell signaling or vesicular transport machinery.

Veltel et al. (2008) found that recombinant human RP2 formed a complex
with murine Arl3 and with human HRG4 (UNC119; 604011), the retinal
homolog of PDE-delta (PDE6D; 602676). RP2 induced hydrolysis of Arl3-GTP
in the Arl3-HRG4 complex, leading to the release of HRG4, which bound
only weakly to Arl3-GDP.

Zhou et al. (2006) stated that ARL2 and ARL3 arose from a common
ancestor early in eukaryotic evolution and that they remain highly
related. However, Zhou et al. (2006) found that the 2 GTPases had
distinct effects on microtubule function in mammalian cells. Knockdown
of ARL3 using RNA interference changed HeLa cell morphology, caused
Golgi fragmentation, and increased acetylation of alpha-tubulin (see
602529), which resulted in failure of cytokinesis, with increased number
of binucleated cells. Overexpression of ARL3 had little effect. In
contrast, knockdown of ARL2 in HeLa cells showed little effect, but
expression of ARL2 with a dominant activating mutation caused failure of
tubulin polymerization, with loss of microtubules and microtubule-based
mitotic spindle, resulting in cell cycle arrest in M phase.

Ismail et al. (2011) stated that PDE-delta binds to farnesylated small G
proteins. They presented the 1.7-angstrom structure of human PDE-delta
in complex with C-terminally farnesylated human RHEB (601293). PDE-delta
interacted almost exclusively with the C-terminal farnesyl moiety of
RHEB, which was inserted within the farnesyl-binding pocket of
PDE-delta. The interaction did not require guanine nucleotide, which
bound RHEB on a surface nearly opposite to the PDE-delta-binding site.
PDE-delta also interacted with mouse Arl2. The interaction of PDE-delta
with Arl2 was dependent upon GTP and caused a conformational change in
PDE-delta that closed its farnesyl-binding pocket. In solution, addition
of Arl2-GTP dissociated the PDE-delta-farnesylated RHEB complex.
Addition of Arl3-GTP also caused release of farnesylated RHEB from
PDE-delta. In transfected canine kidney cells, fluorescence-labeled RHEB
showed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localization. Addition of
PDE-delta relocalized RHEB into a cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution,
and subsequent addition of Arl2-GTP restored RHEB localization to ER and
Golgi membranes. Ismail et al. (2011) concluded that PDE-delta functions
as a solubilization factor for farnesylated RHEB and that ARL2 and ARL3
act in a GTP-dependent manner as allosteric release factors for
farnesylated RHEB.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Veltel et al. (2008) solved the crystal structure of the central G
domain of mouse Arl3 bound to a GTP analog and human RP2 to 2.6-angstrom
resolution. Both switch regions of Arl3 interacted with the N-terminal
beta-helix domain of RP2. Biochemical analysis showed that Arl3 had a
slow intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis, which was accelerated more than
1,400-fold by catalytic amounts of RP2. Veltel et al. (2008) also
determined that arg118 of RP2 and gln71 of Arl3 were crucial active site
catalytic residues. They concluded that RP2 is a GTPase-activating
protein (GAP) for ARL3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schrick et al. (2006) found that while Arl3 +/- mice appeared normal,
Arl3 -/- mice were obtained at a submendelian ratio, were small and
sickly, and had markedly swollen abdomens. Arl3 -/- mice failed to
thrive and all died by 3 weeks of age. They exhibited abnormal
development of renal, hepatic, and pancreatic epithelial tubule
structures, with abnormal epithelial cell proliferation and cyst
formation characteristic of ARPKD (263200). Moreover, mice lacking Arl3
exhibited photoreceptor degeneration as early as postnatal day 14.
Schrick et al. (2006) concluded that absence of Arl3 causes a ciliary
disease affecting the kidney, biliary tract, pancreas, and retina.

611616	TITLE *611616 NAD KINASE; NADK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NADK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to NAD to
generate NADP, which in its reduced form acts as an electron donor for
biosynthetic reactions (Lerner et al., 2001).

CLONING

By EST database analysis using prokaryotic DNA kinase sequences as
probe, followed by PCR of a human fibroblast cDNA library, Lerner et al.
(2001) cloned NADK. The deduced 446-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 49.2 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.0-kb
transcript with high expression in placenta, moderate expression in
brain, colon, heart, liver, kidney, lung, spleen, stomach, and testis,
and low expression in small intestine. A band of 1.8 kb was detected in
several tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant NADK overexpressed in E. coli, Lerner et al. (2001)
showed that purified NADK catalyzed the synthesis of NADP from NAD and
ATP. By gel filtration analysis, they determined that catalytically
active human NADK was a homotetramer. NADK exhibited a specific activity
of 6.7 microM with a high specificity for NAD and ATP substrates. NADK
activity was resistant to heat treatment, had an optimum pH of 7-8, and
required divalent cations. NADK displayed a preference for zinc and
manganese ions over magnesium ions, while copper and nickel ions had no
effect on enzyme activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lerner et al. (2001) determined that the NADK gene contains 11 exons
spanning 14 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerner et al. (2001) mapped the NADK gene
to chromosome 1p36.33-p36.21.

;;SCOTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding Scotin, which they called
HSPC217, from CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. The deduced 170-amino acid protein contains an MYB (189990)
DNA-binding domain repeat signature. Microarray analysis of 5
hematopoietic cell lines detected low-level expression of Scotin in NB4
and Jurkat cells, but no expression was detected in HL60, K562, and U937
cells.

Bourdon et al. (2002) identified mouse Scotin by differential display of
spleen and thymus of normal and p53 (191170) null mice after gamma
irradiation of whole animals. The induced 1.85-kb transcript encodes a
deduced 235-amino acid protein. By searching an EST database using the
mouse sequence as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bourdon
et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Scotin from a placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 240-amino acid human protein shares 70%
identity with mouse Scotin. Both the human and the mouse proteins
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a central transmembrane domain
composed of 18 hydrophobic amino acids, and a proline/tyrosine domain,
and both show an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western blot
analysis. Immunolocalization of exogenously expressed Scotin revealed
colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. By mutation
analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the proline-rich domain
is required for ER localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bourdon et al. (2002) noted that mouse thymus and spleen cells underwent
massive p53-dependent apoptosis following ultraviolet irradiation or
exposure to actinomycin D. They found that Scotin mRNA was induced
coincident with apoptosis and was expressed only in spleen and thymus of
irradiated wildtype mice and not in the spleen or thymus of irradiated
p53 null mice. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they
confirmed direct binding between p53 and Scotin, and using a luciferase
reporter plasmid driven by the mouse Scotin promoter, they confirmed
dose-dependent p53 transactiviation. Furthermore, Bourdon et al. (2002)
showed that the apoptosis induced by the p53/Scotin pathway is caspase
dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the
human Scotin gene contains 6 exons. They identified a p53-responsive
element of 9 decamers within the mouse Scotin promoter.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the human
Scotin gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et
al. (2002) mapped the Scotin gene to chromosome 3p21.3. They also
identified a Scotin pseudogene on chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

172471	TITLE *172471 PHOSPHORYLASE KINASE, TESTIS/LIVER, GAMMA-2; PHKG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PHKG2 gene encodes the hepatic and testis isoform of the gamma
subunit of phosphorylase kinase (PHK; EC 2.7.11.19). The skeletal muscle
isoform of the gamma subunit is encoded by the PHKG1 gene (172470).

CLONING

Whitmore et al. (1994) isolated a clone identified as the PHKG2 gene
from a heteronuclear cDNA library constructed from a mouse/human somatic
cell hybrid that contained chromosome 16. Most of the sequence showed
100% homology with the sequence of an isoform of a catalytic subunit of
phosphorylase kinase (Hanks, 1989).

GENE STRUCTURE

Burwinkel et al. (1998) determined that the PHKG2 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 9.5 kb. The positions of introns were highly conserved between
PHKG2 and PHKG1. The beginning of intron 2 harbors a highly polymorphic
GGT/GT microsatellite repeat.

MAPPING

Whitmore et al. (1994) mapped the PHKG2 gene to chromosome 16p12.1-p11.2
by use of a high-resolution somatic cell panel.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Maichele et al. (1996) reported that autosomal liver-specific PHK
deficiency (glycogen storage disease IXc; GSD9C; 613027) was caused by
mutations in the PHKG2 gene. They found homozygous PHKG2 mutations in 3
patients of consanguineous parentage. One mutation was a single basepair
insertion in codon 89 that caused a frameshift and premature chain
termination (172471.0001). The 3 other mutations resulted in
nonconservative replacements of amino acid residues that are highly
conserved within the catalytic core regions of all protein kinases. The
findings suggested that the PHKG2 gene product is the predominant
isoform of catalytic gamma subunit of PHK not only in testis but also in
liver, erythrocytes, and possibly other nonmuscle tissues.

Burwinkel et al. (1998) identified homozygous translation-terminating
mutations in the PHKG2 gene, R442X (17241.0004) and 277delC
(172471.0005), in 2 patients with liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency
who developed cirrhosis in childhood. As liver phosphorylase kinase
deficiency is generally a benign condition and progression to cirrhosis
is very rare, the findings suggested to the authors that PHKG2 mutations
are particularly associated with an increased cirrhosis risk.

Burwinkel et al. (2000) reported compound heterozygosity for missense
mutations in the PHKG2 gene (172471.0006; 172471.0007) in a child with
phosphorylase kinase deficiency and cirrhosis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Malthus et al. (1980) described deficiency of liver phosphorylase kinase
in rats and concluded that it was an autosomal recessive trait. Apart
from hepatomegaly, the affected rats appear healthy. Clark and Haynes
(1988) described autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease in the rat
(gsd/gsd). Maichele et al. (1996) identified a homozygous mutation in
the rat Phkg2 gene (D215N) as responsible for the gsd phenotype in the
rat.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, 1-BP INS

In a Norwegian girl with autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease
IXc (613027) Sovik et al. (1982), Maichele et al. (1996) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in codon 89 of the PHKG2 gene; the
resultant frameshift (after 22% of the normal length of the reading
frame) led to premature termination of the predicted polypeptide after
12 additional amino acids. The parents, who were fourth cousins, and a
sister were unaffected. She proband presented at 5 months of age, and
again at 3 years, with marked hepatomegaly, generalized muscular
hypotonia, growth retardation, elevated serum transaminases, and massive
liver glycogenosis. PHK activity was barely detectable in liver; in a
muscle biopsy, PHK activity was moderately reduced (35% of controls) but
muscle glycogen content was nevertheless low. No liver fibrosis was
observed. She attained a normal height of 172 cm at age 18, and menarche
was at age 17. The relative size of the liver gradually decreased, and
at age 18 serum activities of gamma-glutamyltransferase and alanine
aminotransferase were approaching normal ranges. Serum cholesterol was
normal, hypoglycemic symptoms were not noted, and body weight was
normal.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, GLY189GLU

In a French girl with glycogen storage disease IXc (613027), whose
parents were first cousins, Maichele et al. (1996) identified
homozygosity for a G-to-A transition in the PHKG2 gene that led to a
gly189-to-glu (G189E) substitution. G189 is absolutely conserved between
the testicular and muscle forms of the gamma subunit of several species
and is never occupied by charged amino acids. The patient had been
hospitalized at 7 months of age because of hypoglycemic episodes and
pronounced hepatomegaly. Mild muscle hypotonia and retardation of growth
and motor development were also observed. Notable laboratory findings
were persistent hypoglycemia with acidosis, and elevated triglycerides
and transaminases. Liver histology revealed fine portal fibrosis.

.0003
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, VAL106GLU

In a Pakistani girl with glycogen storage disease IXc (613027), whose
parents were first cousins, Maichele et al. (1996) demonstrated
homozygosity for a val106-to-glu (V106E) missense mutation in the PHKG2
gene. The girl was admitted at the age of 15 months for investigation of
a distended abdomen due to hepatomegaly with no other clinical symptoms
except growth retardation. However, she had increased serum ALT and
triglycerides, increased liver glycogen, and severe fibrosis and
proliferation of bile ducts on liver biopsy.

.0004
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, ARG44TER

In a female with liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency and cirrhosis
(GSD9C; 612027), whose parents were consanguineous, Burwinkel et al.
(1998) found point mutations in the PHKG2 gene. One patient had a C-to-T
transition in exon 3, resulting in an arg44-to-ter (R44X) nonsense
mutation. In an earlier biochemical analysis of her family (Kagalwalla
et al., 1995), her father and 2 sibs had PHK activities in the
heterozygous range, whereas her mother had normal PHK activity in
repeated tests, so that a new maternal mutation was suspected in spite
of her parents' consanguinity. However, analysis of the parents' DNA
indicated that both were heterozygous for the nonsense mutation.

.0005
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, 1-BP DEL, 277C

In a female with deficiency of liver phosphorylase kinase and cirrhosis
(GSD9C; 613027) who had previously been described by Shiomi et al.
(1989), Burwinkel et al. (1998) identified deletion of a cytosine
residue in codon 93 (exon 4) of the PHKG2 gene, leading to a frameshift
after 23% of the coding sequence and termination of translation after 17
additional codons. The patient's parents were consanguineous.

.0006
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, HIS144TYR

In a male child of unrelated English parents with liver phosphorylase
kinase deficiency and cirrhosis (GSD9C; 613027), Burwinkel et al. (2000)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PHKG2 gene: a
C-to-T transition resulting in a his144-to-tyr (H144Y) substitution,
which was inherited from his father, and a T-to-G transversion resulting
in a leu225-to-arg (L225R) substitution (172471.0007), which was
inherited from his mother.
