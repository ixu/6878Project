605416	TITLE *605416 DICKKOPF, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF, 3; DKK3
DESCRIPTION For background information on WNT and Dickkopf proteins, see WNT6
(604663) and DKK1 (605189).

CLONING

By searching EST databases with a partial DKK3 sequence, followed by
probing a fetal brain cDNA library, Krupnik et al. (1999) isolated a
cDNA encoding DKK3. The deduced 350-amino acid DKK3 protein, like DKK1,
DKK2 (605415), and DKK4 (605417), possesses an N-terminal signal peptide
and 2 conserved cysteine-rich domains, which are separated by a linker
region and contain 10 cys residues each. The second cys region has a
putative lipid-binding function that may facilitate WNT/DKK interactions
at the plasma membrane. The linker region contains 50 to 55 amino acids
in DKK1, DKK2, and DKK4, whereas in DKK3 it contains only 12 amino
acids. DKK3 has 4 potential N-glycosylation sites and possesses an
extended N-terminal domain preceding the first cys domain as well as an
extended C-terminal region following the second cys domain. All DKKs
have several potential sites for cleavage by furin-type proteases.
Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.5-kb DKK3
transcript, with highest expression in heart, brain, and spinal cord. In
situ hybridization analysis demonstrated highest expression of Dkk3 in
mouse brain, eye, and heart. Western blot analysis showed that DKK3 is
secreted as a heterogeneous 45- to 65-kD protein; deglycosylation
reduced the protein to 40- and 45- to 55-kD proteins. Functional
analysis determined that DKK3 does not block Xenopus Wnt8 induction of a
secondary axis in frog embryos.

608402	TITLE *608402 MEMBRANE-SPANNING 4-DOMAINS, SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 6E; MS4A6E
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Most MS4A genes encode proteins with at least 4 potential transmembrane
domains and N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains encoded by distinct
exons. The exception is MS4A6E, which encodes a protein with only 2
transmembrane domains and no C-terminal cytoplasmic domain.

CLONING

By searching for additional genes in the MS4A complex on chromosome
11q12-q13, Liang et al. (2001) identified MS4A4E (608401), MS4A10
(608403), and MS4A6E. The putative MS4A6E gene encodes a 147-amino acid
protein that is 78% identical to MS4A6A (606548), with high homology in
the hydrophobic regions and the intracellular N-terminal domain. MS4A6E
lacks a C-terminal intracellular domain. RT-PCR analysis failed to
detect MS4A6E transcripts in any tissues or hemopoietic cell lines
tested. EST database searching identified sequences from pooled fetal
organ libraries. Liang et al. (2001) proposed that expression may occur
primarily during oncogenesis or embryogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liang et al. (2001) determined that the MS4A6E gene contains at least 4
exons and spans more than 5 kb. It lacks the exons encoding the first 2
transmembrane domains found in most MS4A genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Liang et al. (2001) mapped the MS4A6E gene
to chromosome 11q12-q13.1, between the MS4A4A (606547) and MS4A7
(606502) genes.

DYSTROPHIN-ASSOCIATED GLYCOPROTEIN, 25-KD;;
DAGA5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) is a multisubunit protein
complex that spans the sarcolemma and provides structural linkage
between the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix of
muscle cells. There are 3 main subcomplexes of the DGC: the cytoplasmic
proteins dystrophin (DMD; 300377) and syntrophin (SNTA1; 601017), the
alpha- and beta-dystroglycans (see 128239), and the sarcoglycans (see,
e.g., SGCA; 600119) (Crosbie et al., 2000). The SSPN gene encodes
sarcospan, another member of the DGC.

CLONING

Scott et al. (1994) reported the sequence of a murine gene that is
coamplified with Ki-ras (190070) in the Y1 murine adrenal carcinoma cell
line. The gene, which they designated Krag (Kirsten ras-associated
gene), encodes a predicted 216-amino acid protein with 4 potential
hydrophobic domains. Its hydropathy plot resembles certain of the
transmembrane-4 superfamily members such as CO-029 (600769) and ME491
(155740).

Heighway et al. (1996) isolated the human KRAG gene and showed that the
predicted amino acid sequence is 91% identical to the mouse sequence.
Northern blot analysis showed that KRAG is expressed in a variety of
tissues with highest levels in muscle, where alternative splice variants
were also observed. One end of the YAC contained a sequence that was
identical to that reported for inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type
2 (ITPR2; 600144), which had previously been mapped to 12p11.

Crosbie et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA for the 25-kD
dystrophin-associated protein from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library.
The cDNA encodes a protein with 4 transmembrane spanning domains, which
the authors termed 'sarcospan.' Northern blot analysis detected a 6.5-kb
mRNA transcript exclusively in skeletal and cardiac muscle; a 4.5-kb
mRNA transcript was also identified in skeletal and cardiac muscle as
well as in thymus, prostate, testes, ovary, small intestine, colon, and
spleen. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that sarcospan complexes
with and is an integral component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein
complex.

GENE STRUCTURE

Heighway et al. (1996) determined that the human KRAG gene contains 3
exons.

Scott et al. (1994) determined that the murine Krag gene contains 3
exons and spans about 20 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Heighway et al. (1996) mapped the
human KRAG gene to chromosome 12p11.2.

Scott et al. (1994) found that a homologous EST to murine Krag mapped to
chromosome 12.

GENE FUNCTION

Heighway et al. (1996) showed that KRAS2, KRAG, and ITPR2 were all
coamplified in lung and ovarian carcinoma cells.

Several autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (see
253600) are caused by primary mutations in sarcoglycan genes. Crosbie et
al. (2000) showed that the sarcospan protein is lost in patients with
either a complete or partial loss of alpha-, beta-, or gamma-sarcoglycan
(SGCG; 608896). In particular, sarcospan was absent in a
gamma-sarcoglycanopathy (LGDM2C; 253700) patient with normal levels of
alpha-, beta- (600900), and delta-sarcoglycan (601411). The authors
hypothesized that assembly of the complete, tetrameric sarcoglycan
complex is a prerequisite for membrane targeting and localization of
sarcospan. The authors screened over 50 autosomal recessive muscular
dystrophy cases for mutations in sarcospan, but none was identified.

610950	TITLE *610950 SYNAPTOTAGMIN 16; SYT16
;;SYNAPTOTAGMIN 14-RELATED PROTEIN; STREP14
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences encoding synaptotagmin-like C2
domains, Fukuda (2003) identified mouse and human SYT14 (610949) and
SYT16, which they called STREP14. The deduced mouse and human STREP14
proteins contain 639 and 625 amino acids, respectively. Both have
C-terminal C-type tandem C2 domains, but they lack the N-terminal
transmembrane domain found in other synaptotagmins. RT-PCR detected
highest Strep14 expression in mouse heart and testis, with weaker
expression in kidney and lung. In mouse embryos, expression was weak on
day 7 and strong on days 11, 15, and 17.

GENE FUNCTION

Fukuda (2003) found that mouse Strep14 showed relatively weak
homooligomerization and heterooligomerization with Syt14, irrespective
of the presence of Ca(2+). The C2 domains of Strep14 bound liposomes
made up of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fukuda (2003) mapped the human SYT16 gene
to chromosome 14q23.1 and the mouse Syt16 gene to chromosome 12C3.

608110	TITLE *608110 p21 PROTEIN-ACTIVATED KINASE 6; PAK6
;;p21 CDC42/RAC1-ACTIVATED KINASE 6
DESCRIPTION For background information on p21-activated kinases (PAKs), see PAK1
(602590).

CLONING

Using androgen receptor (AR; 313700) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen,
followed by 5-prime RACE, Yang et al. (2001) cloned PAK6 from a prostate
cDNA library. The deduced 681-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 75 kD. In vitro translation confirmed that PAK6
is a 75-kD protein. Like other members of the PAK family, PAK6 has an
N-terminal CDC42 (116952)/RAC (602048) interactive binding (CRIB) domain
and a C-terminal kinase domain. The C-terminal kinase domain of PAK6
shares 78% similarity with the corresponding regions of PAK4 (605451)
and PAK7 (608038). Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb PAK6
transcript expressed at a high level in testis and at a lower level in
prostate. No expression was detected in the other tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

In a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Yang et al. (2001) found a 170-fold increase
in the association between PAK6 and AR in the presence of
dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed
that the interaction between PAK6 and AR required DHT. The isolated
kinase domain of PAK6 was active against a test substrate, while
full-length PAK6 showed lower kinase activity.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the PAK6 gene to chromosome 15q15.1 based on an
alignment of the PAK6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC035596) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION For background information on the NBPF gene family, see NBPF1 (610501).

CLONING

By searching EST databases for NBPF family members, Vandepoele et al.
(2005) identified NBPF3. EST database analysis suggested ubiquitous
NBPF3 expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vandepoele et al. (2005) determined that the NBPF3 gene contains 13
coding exons.

Vandepoele and van Roy (2007) found that, unlike other transcriptionally
active NBPF family members, NBPF3 lacks an insertion of a human
endogenous retrovirus K long-terminal repeat in its 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Vandepoele et al. (2005) mapped
the NBPF3 gene to chromosome 1p36, where it lies in a cluster with NBPF1
and a pseudogene, NBPF2P.

DESCRIPTION A 120-kD oviductal glycoprotein is secreted into the oviductal lumen
during the estrogen-dominated follicular and periovulatory phases of the
menstrual cycle. Arias et al. (1994) cloned the cDNA encoding the
oviductal glycoprotein. The sequence predicts a 654-amino acid
polypeptide that contains 4 potential N-glycosylation sites, 2 potential
N-myristoylation sites, and several potential phosphorylation sites. The
sequence has approximately 50% similarity to those of a subfamily of
glycosyl hydrolases. Northern blot analysis revealed a 2.4-kb message in
oviduct, but none in endometrium, cervix, or a variety of other tissues.
Slot blot analysis revealed that the expression of OVGP1 is highest
during the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, suggesting that
estrogen may control its expression.

608853	TITLE *608853 BH3-LIKE MOTIF-CONTAINING CELL DEATH INDUCER; BLID
;;BREAST CANCER CELL 2; BRCC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Broustas et al. (2004) amplified a BRCC2 cDNA from breast cancer cell
line mRNA. The deduced 108-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 12 kD. The N terminus contains a domain similar to the BH3
domain of proapoptotic proteins. Western blot analysis detected
endogenous BRCC2 in all human cell lines tested. In COS-1 and HeLa
cells, BRCC2 was predominantly a cytosolic protein, with lower abundance
in mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Broustas et al. (2004) found that exogenous expression of BRCC2 caused
apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by enhanced chromatin condensation,
DNA fragmentation, or an enhanced number of cells in the sub-G1 phase.
In a human prostate cancer cell line, BRCC2-induced DNA fragmentation
was blocked by coexpression of the antiapoptotic molecule BCLXL (600039)
or by a broad-range caspase inhibitor. BRCC2 expression correlated with
activation of CASP3 (600636) and CASP9 (602234). BRCC2 with an
N-terminal deletion of the BH3-like domain failed to induce apoptosis.
Treatment of HeLa cells with doxorubicin or hydrogen peroxide led to an
increase in the mitochondrial level of endogenous BRCC2. Broustas et al.
(2004) concluded that BRCC2 functions as a proapoptotic molecule through
the caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway of cell death.

GENE STRUCTURE

Broustas et al. (2004) determined that BRCC2 is an intronless gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Broustas et al. (2004) mapped the BLID
gene to chromosome 11q24.1.

Rogaeva et al. (2007) indicated that the BRCC2 gene is located just
distal to SORL1 (602005).

608172	TITLE *608172 DEHYDRODOLICHYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE; DHDDS
;;DEDOL-PP SYNTHASE;;
HDS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate (dedol-PP) synthase catalyzes cis-prenyl
chain elongation to produce the polyprenyl backbone of dolichol, a
glycosyl carrier lipid required for the biosynthesis of several classes
of glycoproteins (summary by Endo et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to E. coli undecaprenyl
diphosphate synthase (UPS) and S. cerevisiae dedol-PP synthase, followed
by RT-PCR of a testis cDNA library, Endo et al. (2003) cloned DHDDS,
which they designated HDS. The deduced 333-amino acid DHDDS protein
contains all 5 regions conserved among cis-prenyl chain-elongating
enzymes in several eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. DHDDS shares
41.8% homology with yeast dedol-PP synthase and 37.6% homology with E.
coli UPS. Northern blot analysis detected high DHDDS expression in
testis and kidney, with lower levels in heart, spleen, and thymus.

Zelinger et al. (2011) performed RT-PCR analysis in 21 human tissues and
observed ubiquitous expression of DHDDS, with a band of higher intensity
in the retinal sample compare to other tissues. The analysis confirmed
the expression of the full-length transcript in the retina as well as 3
alternatively spliced variants, 2 of which were in-frame and likely to
encode a protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Endo et al. (2003) determined that the DHDDS gene contains 8 coding
exons and spans more than 37 kb. Zelinger et al. (2011) noted that the
DHDDS gene contains 9 exons and that exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Endo et al. (2003) mapped the DHDDS gene
to chromosome 1p35.

By genomic sequence analysis, Zelinger et al. (2011) mapped the DHDDS
gene to chromosome 1p36.11.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro assay, Endo et al. (2003) demonstrated cis-prenyltransferase
activity in DHDDS-transformed yeast membrane fractions incubated with
radiolabeled isopentenyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate as
substrates. Thin-layer chromatography detected synthesis of high levels
of dolichols with major chain lengths of C90, C95, and C100, consistent
with dolichols isolated from human tissues.

Zelinger et al. (2011) performed immunohistochemical analysis of the
human retina with anti-DHDDS antibodies and observed intense labeling of
the cone and rod photoreceptor inner segments.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected sibs from an Ashkenazi Jewish family with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP59; 613861), in whom mutation in all known RP genes had
been excluded, Zuchner et al. (2011) performed whole-exome sequencing
and identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the DDHS gene
(K42E; 608172.0001) that was not present in their unaffected sib. The
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was
detected in heterozygosity in 8 of 717 Ashkenazi Jewish controls but was
not found in 6,977 confirmed non-Ashkenazi white controls; the variant
was also found once in 5,893 additional white controls for whom
genomewide genotype data were not available. Zuchner et al. (2011)
stated that E42K likely arose from an ancestral founder.

In 15 (12%) of 123 Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) probands with RP, Zelinger et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the K42E founder mutation. The
K42E mutation was found in heterozygosity in 1 of 322 ethnically matched
controls, indicating a carrier frequency of 0.3% in the AJ population,
but was not detected in an additional set of 109 AJ patients with RP, in
20 AJ patients with other inherited retinal diseases, or in 70 patients
with retinal degeneration of other ethnic origins.

ANIMAL MODEL

By morpholino-knockdown of Dhdds in zebrafish, Zuchner et al. (2011)
observed failure to exhibit the typical escape response to light on-off
switches, and microscopic examination of the morphant retina revealed
that photoreceptor outer segments were very short or completely missing;
in addition, one-third of zebrafish morphants had smaller eyes and a
slight ventral flexion to the body axis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 59
DHDDS, LYS42GLU

In 3 affected sibs from an Ashkenazi Jewish family with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP59; 613861), Zuchner et al. (2011) identified homozygosity
for a 124A-G transition in exon 3 of the DHDDS gene, resulting in a
lys42-to-glu (K42E) substitution at a highly conserved residue located
close to the catalytic center and the substrate binding site for
farnesyl phosphate. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was also detected in heterozygosity in 8 of 717
Ashkenazi Jewish controls but not found in 6,977 confirmed non-Ashkenazi
white controls; the variant was also found once in 5,893 additional
white controls for whom genomewide genotype data were not available.

In 20 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with RP from 15 families, Zelinger et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the E42K founder mutation in exon
3 of the DHDDS gene.

609977	TITLE *609977 CELL DIVISION CYCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; CDCA8
;;DASRA B;;
BOREALIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDCA8 is a component of a chromosomal passenger complex required for
stability of the bipolar mitotic spindle (Gassmann et al., 2004).

CLONING

By database analysis, Sampath et al. (2004) identified human CDCA8 as a
homolog of Xenopus Dasra B. The deduced 280-amino acid human protein,
which the authors called Dasra B, shares 42% and 23% identity with
Xenopus Dasra B and Dasra A, respectively. Immunofluorescence on
metaphase HeLa cells revealed Dasra B in a punctate distribution on
chromosomes, coincident with Aurora B (AURKB; 604970) staining.

Using a proteomic screen to identify proteins associated with
histone-depleted mitotic chromosomes, Gassmann et al. (2004) identified
CDCA8, which they called borealin. The deduced 280-amino acid protein
contains 2 putative nuclear localization signals. Secondary structure
predictions suggested borealin forms an N-terminal domain of 6 core
helices and a C-terminal domain of at least 2 strands and 3 helices.
Northern and Western blot analyses showed that borealin mRNA and protein
levels were significantly increased in mitosis. Immunolocalization of
borealin and Aurora B in HeLa cells revealed that the proteins
colocalized in a dynamic pattern throughout mitosis. Western blot
analysis detected borealin at an apparent molecular mass of 31 kD in
HeLa cell lysates.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of HeLa cell lysates, Sampath et al. (2004) found
that Dasra B interacted with Aurora B and survivin (BIRC5; 603352).
Knockdown of Dasra B by small interfering RNA resulted in severe
chromosome misalignment at metaphase and accumulation of multiple
interphase nuclei. In Xenopus, Dasra B associated with survivin, Aurora
B, and Incenp (604411) in a chromosomal passenger complex required for
chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle formation.
Microtubule nucleation through the Dasra B-containing chromosomal
passenger complex was distinct from the Ran (601179)-GTP pathway of
chromatin-induced microtubule nucleation.

Using in vitro binding assays, Gassmann et al. (2004) showed that
recombinant human borealin interacted directly with in vitro translated
INCENP and survivin, but not with Aurora B or TD60 (RCC2; 609587).
Borealin also readily bound itself. Mutation analysis indicated that the
N-terminal domain of borealin, but not the C-terminal domain, interacted
with chromosomal passengers in vivo and could perturb their targeting to
centromeres but not to the spindle midzone. Knockdown of borealin in
HeLa cells by RNA interference resulted in delocalization of INCENP,
survivin, Aurora B, and TD60 and delayed mitotic progression.
Borealin-null cells showed kinetochore-spindle misattachments, increased
number of bipolar spindles associated with ectopic asters, and disrupted
chromosome partitioning at anaphase. Borealin did not increase the
kinase activity of Aurora B in the presence of INCENP and survivin, but
it was an Aurora B target protein.

Tsukahara et al. (2010) isolated a fission yeast cyclin B (123836)
mutant defective specifically in chromosome biorientation. Accordingly,
Tsukahara et al. (2010) identified Cdk1 (116940)-cyclin B-dependent
phosphorylation of survivin (603352). Preventing survivin
phosphorylation impaired centromere chromosomal passenger complex (CPC)
targeting as well as chromosome biorientation, whereas phosphomimetic
survivin suppressed the biorientation defect in the cyclin B mutant.
Survivin phosphorylation promoted direct binding with shugoshin (see
609168), which Tsukahara et al. (2010) defined as a conserved
centromeric adaptor of the CPC. In human cells, the phosphorylation of
borealin has a comparable role. Tsukahara et al. (2010) concluded that
this study resolved the conserved mechanisms of CPC targeting to
centromeres, highlighting a key role of Cdk1-cyclin B in chromosome
biorientation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gassmann et al. (2004) determined that the CDCA8 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gassmann et al. (2004) mapped the CDCA8
gene to chromosome 1. They identified a possible pseudogene on
chromosome 7.

;;GLUCOSAMINE-6-SULFATASE; G6S
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Freeman et al. (1987) reported purification and characterization of
N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.14), which hydrolyzes heparan
sulfate and keratan sulfate. They identified 4 forms of the enzyme in
liver, which were postulated to be due to differences in the state of
processing of a large subunit. The catalytic properties were studied by
Freeman and Hopwood (1987). Using sequences obtained by direct
N-terminal amino acid sequencing of G6S isoforms, Robertson et al.
(1988) designed oligonucleotide probes to screen a liver cDNA library.
The longest clone obtained encoded a deduced 375-amino acid protein
representing form A of G6S. They also identified a clone that represents
the 331-amino acid form B of G6S. Robertson et al. (1988) determined
that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 78-kD form A species and
the 32-kD form B species are identical, indicating that the 78-kD form A
polypeptide is processed by internal peptidase cleavage to a 32-kD
N-terminal species and a 48-kD C-terminal species. Full-length G6S
contains several N-glycosylation sites and a hydrophilic region, rich in
basic amino acids, that may represent the proteolytic cleavage site.

Dhoot et al. (2001) reported the identification of QSulf1, an avian
ortholog of GNS. QSulf1 expression is induced by Sonic hedgehog in
myogenic somite progenitors in quail embryos and is required for the
activation of MyoD (159970), a Wnt (see 164820)-induced regulator of
muscle specification. QSulf1 is localized on the cell surface and
regulates heparan-dependent Wnt signaling in C2C12 myogenic progenitor
cells through a mechanism that requires its catalytic activity,
providing evidence that QSulf1 regulates Wnt signaling through
desulfation of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

MAPPING

Robertson et al. (1988) assigned the glucosamine-6-sulfatase gene, which
they symbolized G6S, to chromosome 12q14 by in situ hybridization of a
tritium-labeled G6S cDNA probe. The localization was confirmed by using
the cDNA clone in 7 analyses of DNA from human/mouse hybrid cell lines.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mok et al. (2003) amplified and sequenced the promoter and 14 exons of
the GNS gene from a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID
(252940) and identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 9,
predicted to result in premature termination at codon 355 (607664.0001).
They also identified 2 common synonymous coding SNPs and genotyped these
in samples from 4 ethnic groups.

Independently, Beesley et al. (2003) identified a 1-bp deletion in the
GNS gene (607664.0002) in a patient with Sanfilippo disease
(mucopolysaccharidosis) type D.

Elcioglu et al. (2009) reported a 10-year-old Turkish boy with
Sanfilippo syndrome type D, in whom they identified homozygosity for a
1-bp insertion in the GNS gene (607664.0005). The authors stated that
this was the twenty-first patient and the eighth mutation reported for
the disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, ARG355TER

In the fibroblast cell line of the 7-year-old East Indian boy with
mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID (252940) described by Kresse et al.
(1980), Mok et al. (2003) identified a homozygous 1063C-T transition in
exon 9 of the GNS gene, predicting a premature termination of
translation at codon 355 (R355X).

.0002
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, 1-BP DEL, 1169A

In a patient with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID (252940), Beesley et
al. (2003) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion, 1169delA, in the
GNS gene. The mutation was predicted to cause a frameshift and premature
termination of the protein. The patient was the offspring of
first-cousin parents from Pakistan. He presented at 3 years of age, at
which time he was very 'lively' and examination was difficult as he was
very fractious. He had a hirsute facies and his facial features were
coarse. He had a large head with frontal bossing, a low nasal bridge,
and a tendency to hypertelorism. His tongue and hands were large. There
was no hepatosplenomegaly or audible murmurs. A skeletal survey was
consistent with a mucopolysaccharidosis.

.0003
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, GLN390TER

In 2 Italian Canadian brothers with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID
(252940), originally reported by Kaplan and Wolfe (1987), Jansen et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous 1168C-T transition in exon 10 of the GNS
gene, resulting in a gln390-to-ter (Q390X) substitution. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation.

.0004
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, 5-BP INS, 1138GTCCT

In a 15-year-old Turkish English girl with mucopolysaccharidosis type
IIID (252940), Jansen et al. (2007) identified a homozygous 5-bp
insertion (1138insGTCCT) in exon 10 of the GNS gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination of the protein at residue 389. She
was severely retarded and fully dependent on assistance for all
activities of daily living.

.0005
MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIID
GNS, 1-BP INS, 1226G

In a 10-year-old Turkish boy with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIID
(252940), Elcioglu et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp
insertion (1226insG) in exon 11 of the GNS gene, predicted to cause a
frameshift and premature termination with loss of the C terminus. The
boy's parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in
100 controls.

610488	TITLE *610488 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 9; TTC9
;;KIAA0227
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated myeloid leukemia
cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned TTC9, which they
called KIAA0227. The deduced protein contains 336 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis detected TTC9 expression in all tissues examined, with
highest expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

Cao et al. (2006) determined that TTC9 encodes a predicted 222-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 24.4 kD. It has 3
C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domains and several potential
N-myristoylation sites, but no transmembrane domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.5-kb TTC9 transcript in a breast cancer cell line.
Northern blot analysis of several human tissues showed variable
expression of 2.5-, 5.1-, and 5.9-kb TTC9 transcripts. Expression of
TTC9 was highest in brain, followed by heart. Western blot analysis
revealed a 25-kD endogenous TTC9 protein in a breast cancer cell line.
Analysis of several normal tissues showed the 25-kD protein in all
tissues examined except liver. A doublet of 36 to 37 kD was also
expressed in brain. Cell fractionation experiments and
immunohistochemical analysis showed that TTC9 was predominantly
associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, although a small fraction was
cytoplasmic.

GENE FUNCTION

By microarray analysis, Cao et al. (2006) found that expression of TTC9
was regulated by progesterone in a breast cancer cell line expressing
progesterone receptor (PGR; 607311). They showed that TTC9 levels were
also regulated by estrogen, growth factors, and an inhibitor of p38
kinase (MAPK14; 600289). Growth factor-induced TTC9 expression was
inhibited by estrogen and abolished by an ERK (see 601795) inhibitor.
The hormonal effect on TTC9 expression was cell-line specific, and TTC9
appeared to be upregulated when the hormonal effect on cells was growth
inhibitory and downregulated when the hormonal effect was stimulatory.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid and human-rodent cell hybrid analyses, Nagase et al.
(1996) mapped the TTC9 gene to chromosome 14. Cao et al. (2006) stated
that the TTC9 gene maps to chromosome 14q24.2.

;;TGFB REGULATOR 1;;
NUCLEAR INTERACTOR OF ARF AND MDM2; NIAM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the p19(Arf) isoform of mouse Cdkn2a (600160) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cDNA library, followed
by RT-PCR of human pancreas cDNA, Tompkins et al. (2006) cloned mouse
and human TBRG1, which they called NIAM. The deduced human protein
contains 411 amino acids.

Using Northern blot analysis, Babalola and Schultz (1995) detected
expression of Tbrg1, which they called Tb5, in all mouse tissues
examined. Highest expression was in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro and in vivo binding assays, including reciprocal
immunoprecipitation assays, Tompkins et al. (2006) confirmed that NIAM
bound p19(ARF), but not the p16(INK4A) isoform of CDKN2A. NIAM appeared
to function downstream of p19(ARF) in G1-phase growth arrest in both p53
(TP53; 191170)-dependent and p53-independent signaling pathways. NIAM
expression was induced in cells undergoing arrest in response to DNA
damage and TGF-beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180) treatment, suggesting it may also
participate in antiproliferative pathways.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TBRG1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP STS-T95820).

606493	TITLE *606493 EXOSOME COMPONENT 1; EXOSC1
;;CSL4, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; CSL4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Inherently unstable mammalian mRNAs contain AU-rich elements (AREs)
within their 3-prime untranslated regions. In yeast, 3-prime-to-5-prime
mRNA degradation is mediated by the exosome, a multisubunit particle.
Chen et al. (2001) purified and characterized the human exosome by mass
spectrometry and found its composition to be similar to its yeast
counterpart. They identified the following protein subunits within the
human exosome: p7, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp4 protein
(602238); p8, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp42 protein (606488);
p9, which is homologous to the yeast Rrp43 protein (OIP2; 606019); p10,
which is homologous to the yeast Rrp40 protein (606489); p11, which is
homologous to the yeast Mtr3 protein (606490); p12A, which is homologous
to the yeast Rrp41 protein (606491); p12B, which is homologous to the
yeast Rrp46 protein (606492); and p13, which is homologous to the yeast
Csl4 protein. They also identified 2 exosome-associated factors, p1
(600478) and p14 (MPP6; 605500), that were not homologous to any yeast
exosome components.

Raijmakers et al. (2002) stated that the CSL4 protein contains 195 amino
acids and has a molecular mass of 21 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a cell-free RNA decay system, Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated that
the mammalian exosome is required for rapid degradation of
ARE-containing RNAs but not for poly(A) shortening. They found that the
mammalian exosome does not recognize ARE-containing RNAs on its own. ARE
recognition required certain ARE-binding proteins that could interact
with the exosome and recruit it to unstable RNAs, thereby promoting
their rapid degradation.

Using mammalian 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses, Raijmakers et al.
(2002) found that the CSL4 protein, but not mutant forms lacking N- or
C-terminal residues, interacted directly with RRP42 and RRP46. The
deletion mutants were also unable to interact with the exosome. RRP42
and RRP46 did not interact with each other.

114780	TITLE *114780 CARBONIC ANHYDRASE VI; CA6
;;CA VI;;
CARBONIC ANHYDRASE, SECRETED;;
GUSTIN
DESCRIPTION Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are a family of zinc metalloenzymes. For
background information on the CA family, see 114800.

CA VI is a 42-kD secreted isozyme found in salivary glands and saliva
(Murakami and Sly, 1987). By using biochemical and immunohistochemical
techniques, Karhumaa et al. (2001) demonstrated that CA VI is also an
elementary component of milk.

Aldred et al. (1991) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones coding for CA6.
The clones identified a 1.45-kb mRNA that was present in high levels in
parotid submandibular salivary glands but absent in other tissues such
as sublingual gland, kidney, liver, and prostate. The cDNA encoded a
protein of 308 amino acids that included a 17-amino acid leader sequence
typical of secreted proteins. The mature CA VI protein has 291 amino
acids, compared to the 259 or 260 residues of the cytoplasmic isozymes;
most of the extra amino acids present are in the carboxyl terminal
region. CA VI has diverged significantly in its structure from the
cytoplasmic isozymes, including CA I (114800), CA II (611492), and CA
III (114750), which are closely related to one another. The CA VI
protein has 35% sequence identity with human CA II, while residues
involved in the active site of the enzymes have been conserved. Southern
analysis of human DNA indicated that there is only 1 gene coding for CA
VI.

Thatcher et al. (1998) identified gustin as CA6. Gustin contains 2
potential N-linked glycosylation sites. By RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE, gustin
purified from human saliva had a molecular mass of 37 kD before
deglycosylation and 33 kD after.

Karhumaa et al. (2001) showed that the 42-kD CA VI glycopolypeptide
purified from human milk shares 100% homology with salivary CA VI in
protein sequence. They found that its concentration is approximately 8
times higher in human colostrum than in mature milk, the latter
corresponding to the levels previously detected in human saliva. The
high concentration in colostrum, in particular its functional and
structural stability in an acidic milieu, and its growth-supporting role
in the taste buds suggest that milk CA VI is an essential factor in
normal growth and development of the infant alimentary tract.

By means of Southern analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by in
situ hybridization, Sutherland et al. (1989) mapped the CA6 gene to
1p36.33-p36.22. White et al. (1998) reported physical mapping of the
CA6, ENO1 (172430), and SLC2A5 (138230) genes to 1p36 by study of yeast-
and P1-artificial chromosome (YAC and PAC) contigs. PACs from the contig
were mapped to 1p36.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

;;GENE UPSTREAM OF NRAS;;
UNR;;
D1S155E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While investigating NRAS (164790), Jeffers et al. (1990) isolated cDNAs
that originated from a closely linked upstream gene on chromosome 1.
RNase protection assays showed that this gene, termed UNR by them, is
transcribed in the same direction as NRAS and that its 3-prime end is
located only 130 bp from the transcription initiation site of NRAS. The
close spatial relationship was conserved in all species from which the
NRAS gene had been isolated. The UNR cDNA contained an open reading
frame capable of encoding a protein of 798 amino acids. UNR transcripts
were detected in mouse, rat, and human cells. Only a single copy of UNR
was detected in the mouse. The gene produced multiple transcripts that
differed in their 3-prime ends and apparently resulted from the
differential use of multiple polyadenylation sites located in the
3-prime untranslated region of the gene. Both UNR and NRAS were
expressed in all tissues examined and the 2 genes may be coordinately
regulated. UNR was first isolated by Doniger and DiPaolo (1988) in
tumorigenic guinea pig cells.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned full-length UNR, which they
designated KIAA0885. The deduced 798-amino acid protein shares 98.6%
amino acid identity with rat Unr. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression
in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

AU-rich elements and protein-coding determinants direct rapid removal of
poly(A) tails as a necessary first step in mRNA decay. Grosset et al.
(2000) determined that 5 proteins form a multiprotein complex associated
with the major protein-coding-region determinant of instability (mCRD)
of the FOS gene (164810): PABP (604679), HNRNPD (601324), PAIP1
(605184), NSAP1, and UNR, a purine-rich RNA-binding protein.
Overexpression of these proteins stabilized mCRD-containing mRNA by
impeding deadenylation.

Chang et al. (2004) presented evidence that UNR is a critical factor in
mCRD-mediated mRNA turnover by binding the mCRD motif and by interacting
with PABP. Their findings indicated that the mCRD-UNR complex serves as
a platform for formation of a deadenylation/decay mRNA-protein complex
involving PABP and the poly(A) nuclease CCR4 (608951).

MAPPING

Jeffers et al. (1990) mapped the UNR gene to chromosome 1, upstream of
the NRAS gene. By FISH, Edwards et al. (1997) localized the gene to
1p13.2.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Purine 5-prime-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) preferentially hydrolyzes
inosine 5-prime-monophosphate (IMP) and other purine nucleotides, and is
allosterically activated by various compounds, including ATP. The enzyme
is exclusively located in the cytoplasmic matrix of cells and may have a
critical role in the maintenance of a constant composition of
intracellular purine/pyrimidine nucleotides in cooperation with other
nucleotidases.

CLONING

Oka et al. (1994) found 2 distinct but closely related types of cDNAs
for purine 5-prime-nucleotidase in a chicken liver cDNA library. The
encoded A- and B-type proteins were similar throughout a central core of
472 amino acids sharing 79% sequence identity. Using degenerate
oligonucleotides based on identical portions of amino acid sequences
between A- and B-type subunits of the chicken enzyme, Oka et al. (1994)
isolated human cytosolic purine 5-prime-nucleotidase cDNA clones with
PCR. The predicted open reading frame encoded a protein of 561 amino
acids with a molecular mass of 64,966 Da. The deduced amino acid
sequence exhibited 95% identity with the sequence of the B-type subunit
of chicken enzyme. Northern blot analysis of placental polyadenylated
RNA revealed a single band of 3.6 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NT5C2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP sts-D38524).

180903	TITLE *180903 RYANODINE RECEPTOR 3; RYR3
;;RYANODINE RECEPTOR, BRAIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ryanodine receptors, such as RYR3, are intracellular calcium ion release
channels responsible for the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores
following transduction of many different extracellular stimuli.

CLONING

Hakamata et al. (1992) deduced the complete amino acid sequence of a
novel ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel from rabbit brain by
cloning and sequence analysis of the cDNA. The protein was composed of
4,872 amino acids and shared characteristic structural features with the
skeletal muscle (RYR1; 180901) and cardiac (RYR2; 180902) ryanodine
receptors. RNA blot hybridization analysis showed that the brain
ryanodine receptor is abundantly expressed in corpus striatum, thalamus,
and hippocampus, whereas the cardiac ryanodine receptor is more
uniformly expressed in the brain. The brain ryanodine receptor gene was
also transcribed in smooth muscle.

Using rabbit Ryr3 cDNA as probe, Nakashima et al. (1997) cloned RYR3
from a brain cDNA library. The deduced 4,866-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of about 551 kD. RYR3 contains 4 repeated
sequences organized into 2 tandem pairs, as well as 4 highly hydrophobic
C-terminal segments. It does not have an N-terminal signal sequence.
Northern blot analysis detected a 16-kb transcript expressed at high
levels in caudate nucleus, amygdala, and hippocampus, and at lower
levels in corpus callosum, substantia nigra, and thalamus. Abundant
expression was also detected in skeletal muscle, and a faint signal was
detected in heart.

Leeb and Brenig (1998) isolated overlapping human RYR3 clones from a
random primed fetal brain cDNA library. The gene encodes a 4,870-amino
acid polypeptide that contains 4 RYR repeats, 3 SPRY domains, an ATP/GTP
binding site consensus sequence, and 3 potential calmodulin-binding
sites. They identified an alternatively spliced transcript that encodes
a truncated protein.

Jiang et al. (2003) identified 7 alternatively spliced variants of
rabbit Ryr3 that were expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

GENE FUNCTION

By functional expression of RYR3 and a chimeric RYR, Nakashima et al.
(1997) confirmed that RYR3 forms a calcium release channel with low
Ca(2+) sensitivity.

Jiang et al. (2003) characterized several rabbit Ryr3 splice variants.
One variant lacked a predicted transmembrane helix encoded by exon 92
and was highly expressed in smooth muscle tissues, but not in skeletal
muscle, heart, or brain. This variant did not form a functional Ca(2+)
channel when expressed alone in HEK293 cells, but it formed functional
heteromeric channels with reduced caffeine sensitivity when coexpressed
with wildtype Ryr3. This variant was also able to form heteromeric
channels with and suppress the activity of Ryr2 in a dominant-negative
manner. Jiang et al. (2003) concluded that the heterogeneity of Ryr3
splice variants may explain the unique tissue-specific pharmacologic and
functional properties of Ryr3.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Sorrentino et al. (1993) mapped the
RYR3 gene to 15q14-q15; 15q15 is a probable location. By in situ
hybridization, Mattei et al. (1994) mapped the type 3 ryanodine receptor
to mouse chromosome 2E5-2F3. Richard et al. (1994) presented an
integrated physical, expression, and genetic map of chromosome 15. They
found that the RYR3 gene fell in their region I: 15pter-q14.

ANIMAL MODEL

Takeshima et al. (1996), Bertocchini et al. (1997), and Futatsugi et al.
(1999) independently generated Ryr3-deficient mice. In all cases, the
homozygous mutant mice were fertile and displayed no gross
abnormalities. Takeshima et al. (1996) detected increased locomotor
activity in Ryr3 knockout mice compared to that of the control mice and
concluded that the lack of Ryr3-mediated Ca(2+) signaling results in
abnormalities of certain neurons in the central nervous system.

Bertocchini et al. (1997) detected normal Ryr3 expression in murine
skeletal muscles during the postnatal phase of muscle development, but
not in muscles of adult mice, with the exception of the diaphragm and
soleus muscles. The authors demonstrated that skeletal muscle
contraction in Ryr3 knockout mice was impaired during the first weeks
after birth. They concluded that Ryr3 has a physiologic role in
excitation-contraction coupling of neonatal skeletal muscles.

Futatsugi et al. (1999) measured the electrophysiologic and
pharmacologic properties of synaptic plasticity in the CA1 area of
Ryr3-deficient mice. The results suggested that Ryr3-mediated
intracellular calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum may inhibit
hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial learning.

Barone et al. (1998) generated double mutant mice carrying a targeted
disruption of both the Ryr1 and Ryr3 genes. Skeletal muscles from mice
homozygous for both mutations did not contract in response to caffeine
or ryanodine. In addition, these muscles showed very low tension when
directly activated with micromolar ionized calcium after membrane
permeabilization, indicating either poor development or degeneration of
the myofibrils. This was confirmed by biochemical analysis of
contractile proteins. Electron microscopy confirmed small size of
myofibrils and showed complete absence of feet (RyRs) in the junctional
sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Balschun et al. (1999) found that hippocampal tissue from Ryr3 knockout
mice showed no morphologic changes and had robust in vitro LTP induced
by repeated strong tetanization in the CA1 region, similar to control
tissue. However, the hippocampal tissue from the mutant mice showed
significantly impaired initial amplitude of potentiation and LTP
maintenance in response to weak tetanization compared to controls. In a
water maze test, the mutant animals showed normal learning acquisition
but had deficits in spatial learning, suggesting impaired synaptic
plasticity. Balschun et al. (1999) concluded that RYR3 has a functional
role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, specifically on the adaptation
of acquired memory in response to external changes or stimuli.

601054	TITLE *601054 PLEXIN A2; PLXNA2
;;PLEXIN 2; PLXN2;;
TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN OCT; OCT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Maestrini et al. (1996) identified PLXNA2, which they called OCT, as a
gene closely related to SEX (300022), a transmembrane protein with
significant homology to members of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
receptor family. They also identified 2 other genes closely related to
SEX, PLXNB1 (601053) and PLXNA1 (601055). The proteins encoded by all 4
genes contain large cytoplasmic domains characterized by a distinctive
highly conserved sequence that Maestrini et al. (1996) called the SEX
domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Suto et al. (2007) found that mouse plexin-A2 preferentially localized
to pyramidal cell dendrites, but not to mossy fibers. In contrast,
plexin-A4 localized to mossy fibers. Sema6a (605885) was expressed and
secreted by CA3 pyramidal cells and interneurons in the stratum
lacunosum-moleculare and functioned with plexin-A4 as a repressive
molecule to mediate mossy fiber repulsion. Plexin-A2 attenuated
Sema6a-mediated mossy fiber repulsion, possibly by sequestration of
Sema6a, allowing mossy fibers to invade the suprapyramidal region of
CA3. Suto et al. (2007) concluded that Sema6a, plexin-A2, and plexin-A4
regulate the laminar projection of mossy fibers in mouse hippocampus.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Janssen et al. (2010) presented crystal structures of cognate complexes
of the semaphorin-binding regions of plexins B1 and A2 with semaphorin
ectodomains (human PLXNB1-SEMA4D (601866) and murine PlxnA2-Sema6A
(605885)), plus unliganded structures of PlxnA2(1-4) and Sema6A(ecto).
These structures, together with biophysical and cellular assays of
wildtype and mutant proteins, revealed that semaphorin dimers
independently bind 2 plexin molecules and that signaling is critically
dependent on the avidity of the resulting bivalent 2:2 complex
(monomeric semaphorin binds plexin but fails to trigger signaling). The
data of Janssen et al. (2010) favored a cell-cell signaling mechanism
involving semaphorin-stabilized plexin dimerization, possibly followed
by clustering, which is consistent with previous functional data.
Furthermore, the shared generic architecture of the complexes, formed
through conserved contacts of the amino-terminal 7-bladed beta-propeller
(sema) domains of both semaphorin and plexin, suggested that a common
mode of interaction triggers all semaphorin-plexin-based signaling,
while distinct insertions within or between blades of the sema domains
determine binding specificity.

Nogi et al. (2010) independently reported the crystal structure of the
semaphorin 6A (605885) receptor-binding fragment and the plexin A2
ligand-binding fragment in both their pre-signaling (before binding) and
signaling (after complex formation) states. Before binding, the Sema6A
ectodomain was in the expected face-to-face homodimer arrangement,
similar to that adopted by Sema3A (603961) and Sema4D, whereas PlxnA2
was in an unexpected head-on homodimer arrangement. In contrast, the
structure of the Sema6A-PlxnA2 signaling complex revealed a 2:2
heterotetramer in which the 2 Plxn2A monomers dissociated from one
another and docked onto the top face of the Sema6A homodimer using the
same interface as the head-on homodimer, indicating that plexins undergo
'partner exchange.' Cell-based activity measurements using mutant
ligands/receptors confirmed that the Sema6A face-to-face dimer
arrangement is physiologically relevant and is maintained throughout
signaling events. Nogi et al. (2010) concluded that
homodimer-to-heterodimer transitions of cell-surface plexin that result
in a specific orientation of its molecular axis relative to the membrane
may constitute the structural mechanism by which the ligand-binding
signal is transmitted to the cytoplasmic region, inducing GAP domain
rearrangements and activation.

MAPPING

By analysis of a panel of human/hamster somatic cell hybrids, Maestrini
et al. (1996) mapped the OCT gene to chromosome 1. Gross (2011) mapped
the PLXNA2 gene to chromosome 1q32.2 based on an alignment of the PLXNA2
sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC136530) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

NOMENCLATURE

Tamagnone et al. (1999) proposed a novel nomenclature for the genes of
the plexin family, which they grouped into the A, B, C, and D
subfamilies; the PLXN2 gene was renamed plexin A2 by them.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mossy fibers are the last hippocampal afferents to invade CA3, and in
mouse, they do so around the time of birth. Suto et al. (2007) showed
that plexin-A2 deletion in mice caused a shift of mossy fibers from the
suprapyramidal region to the infra- and intrapyramidal regions. In
plexin-A2 -/- plexin-A4 -/- double-knockout mice, mossy fibers were
widely distributed within CA3 in a pattern similar to that seen in
plexin-A4 -/- mice, suggesting that plexin-A4 has a predominant role in
the laminar projection of mossy fibers. Mossy fiber synapses formed
normally and were functional in plexin-A2 -/- mice.

;;POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, ETHER-A-GO-GO-RELATED SUBFAMILY,

BRAIN-SPECIFIC EAG-LIKE CHANNEL 1; BEC1
DESCRIPTION Voltage-gated potassium channels play an essential role in controlling
cellular excitability in the nervous system by regulating a variety of
neuronal properties, such as interspike membrane potential, action
potential waveform, and firing frequency. These channels constitute an
evolutionarily related superfamily that can be classified into 2 groups,
the Shaker family and the ether-a-go-go (eag) family. The eag family
includes Drosophila eag, human EAG (KCNH1; 603305), rat Eag, Drosophila
eag-related gene (erg), human ERG (KCNH2; 152427), and rat Elk. Members
of the eag family are related to cyclic nucleotide-gated cation
channels, hyperpolarization-activated cation channels, and plant
hyperpolarization-activated potassium channels. A common feature of the
C terminus of eag-type channels is a putative cyclic nucleotide-binding
(CNB) domain. By searching an EST database using the amino acid sequence
of human ERG as the query, Miyake et al. (1999) identified ESTs encoding
KCNH3, which they named BEC1. They isolated a cDNA containing the entire
KCNH3 coding sequence. The predicted 1,083-amino acid KCNH3 protein has
6 transmembrane domains, the pore region of voltage-gated potassium
channels, a CNB domain, and putative N-glycosylation sites. KCNH3 shares
95% amino acid sequence identity with rat Kcnh3, 48% identity with human
BEC2 (KCNH4; 604528), 46% identity with rat Elk, 33% similarity with
human ERG, and 30% similarity with rat Eag. The authors concluded that
KCNH3, BEC2, and Elk form a subfamily within the eag family. Expression
of recombinant KCNH3 in mammalian cells induced a voltage-gated outward
current with a fast inactivation component. This current was insensitive
to tetraethylammonium and quinidine. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a major 4-kb KCNH3 transcript in brain; KCNH3
expression was not found in any other tissue examined. Within brain,
KCNH3 was expressed in cortical structures, such as the cerebral cortex,
amygdala, and hippocampus, and in the striatal regions, including the
putamen and caudate nucleus. KCNH3 expression was not detected in the
spinal cord or in the corpus callosum, which contains primarily axons
and glia. Thus, Miyake et al. (1999) concluded that KCNH3 expression is
largely restricted to the telencephalon. In situ hybridization of rat
brain sections showed prominent expression of Kcnh3 in the hippocampus,
mainly in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell body layers and in the granule
cell layers of the dentate gyrus. In the cerebral cortex, Kcnh3 was
widely expressed from layer II to layer VI, with specific expression in
cell bodies of neurons with typical pyramidal shapes. Miyake et al.
(1999) suggested that KCNH3 is involved in cellular excitability of
restricted neurons in the human central nervous system.

Miyake et al. (1999) noted that the KCNH3 gene overlaps a sequence,
DRES61, that was mapped to 12q13 by Banfi et al. (1996) using FISH.

Ogryzko et al. (1998) identified the human polypeptide PAF65A as a
subunit of the PCAF complex (see 602303). PAF65A shows sequence
similarity to human TAFII80 (602955). The predicted 622-amino acid

FGFR1OP2/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Grand et al. (2004) identified the FGFR1OP2 gene through its involvement
in a fusion with the FGFR1 gene (136350). By 5-prime RACE of the fusion
transcript, followed by RT-PCR and genomic database analysis, they
identified full-length FGFR1OP2. The deduced 253-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 29 kD and contains 4 potential
coiled-coil domains. Microarray data indicated that FGFR1OP2 is
expressed in diverse tissues, including bone marrow, spleen, and thymus.
FGFR1OP2 is highly conserved in evolution, sharing 99% and 98% amino
acid identity with its mouse and rat homologs, respectively. FGFR1OP2
homologs are also present in frog and insect genomes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grand et al. (2004) determined that the FGR1OP2 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Grand et al. (2004) mapped the FGFR1OP2
gene to chromosome 12p11.

- FGFR1OP2/FGFR1 Fusion Gene

Grand et al. (2004) identified a (12;8)(p11;p11p22) insertion in a
75-year-old male who presented with a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma that
progressed rapidly to acute myelogenous leukemia. An obvious chronic
myeloproliferative disease was not apparent during the course of his
disease, but the clinical picture fit the overall pattern seen in
patients with 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (613523). In addition to
the insertion, bone marrow cytogenetics following development of AML
revealed loss of 1 copy of chromosome 7 in all cells analyzed. The
patient also showed mild eosinophilia with infiltration of the affected
lymph node and bone marrow by atypical eosinophils. Grand et al. (2004)
determined that the ins(12;8)(p11;p11p22) resulted in an in-frame fusion
of exon 4 of the FGFR1OP2 gene to exon 9 of the FGFR1 gene. The chimeric
protein contains 526 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of
60 kD. FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 has the first 2 coiled-coil domains of FGFR1OP2
fused to the entire tyrosine kinase domain and part of the juxtamembrane
region of FGFR1. Reciprocal FGFR1-FGFR1OP2 transcripts were not
detected. Since the direction of FGFR1OP2 transcription is in the
opposite orientation to the direction of FGFR1 transcription, an
inversion must have taken place in the formation of the chimeric gene.

;;HUMAN ENHANCER OF INVASION 10; HEI10;;
CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 18; C14ORF18
HEI10/HMGIC FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HEI10 is a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family and functions in
progression of the cell cycle through G(2)/M.

CLONING

By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library for enhancement of invasive
filamentous growth of yeast, Toby et al. (2003) identified a partial
cDNA for HEI10 (human enhancer of invasion-10). By database mining, they
assembled a full-length cDNA, which encodes a deduced 277-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. The protein contains a
divergent RING finger motif in the N terminus, a coiled-coil domain, and
cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites in the C
terminus. Northern blot analysis identified a 1.6-kb HEI10 transcript
that was expressed at high levels in heart, moderate levels in kidney
and liver, and low levels in placenta, brain, and lung. Toby et al.
(2003) noted that the 87% sequence identity shared by the human and
mouse HEI10 orthologs is slightly higher than the average identified by
Makatowski et al. (1996).

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Toby et al. (2003) demonstrated the
interaction of HEI10 with cyclin B1 (123836) and the E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 (603721). Deletion constructs showed
that the RING finger domain is required for induction of filamentous
growth. Immunofluorescence analysis of human cell lines using an HEI10
antibody showed nuclear localization of HEI10, with strong expression
during cellular growth and chromosomal association during mitosis. HEI10
expression in Xenopus oocytes showed that HEI10 acts as an E3 ubiquitin
ligase, causing delayed entry into mitosis by reducing cyclin B levels.
In vitro, the cyclin B-cdc2 complex phosphorylated HEI10 primarily at
the NTPVR cell cycle kinase consensus site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Toby et al. (2003) determined that the HEI10 gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

Band 12q15 is often rearranged in benign mesenchymal tumors such as
uterine leiomyomas (150699), and the HMGIC gene (600698) is present in
that region. Mine et al. (2001) identified HEI10 as a fusion partner
with HMGIC in a uterine leiomyoma. Radiation hybrid mapping demonstrated
that the normal location of HEI10 is 14q11. In the fusion transcript,
the first 2 exons of the HMGIC gene, which encode DNA-binding domains,
were fused in the 3-prime portion of the HEI10 gene.

By genomic sequence analysis, Toby et al. (2003) mapped the HEI10 gene
to chromosome 14q11.1.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Milstien et al. (1996) purified and characterized a protein in rat that
bound to GTP cyclohydrolase I (600225) and exhibited
tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent inhibition of that enzyme. They found that
this regulatory protein, which they termed GFRP, consists of a homodimer
of 9.5-kD subunits and has a molecular mass of 20 kD. Milstien et al.
(1996) used peptide sequences to clone the corresponding rat cDNA which
encodes an 84-amino acid polypeptide. Northern blot analysis of rat
tissues revealed that a 0.8-kb GFRP transcript was expressed at
relatively high levels in liver and kidney and at somewhat lower levels
in testis, heart, brain, and lung. Milstien et al. (1996) suggested that
GFRP may play a role in regulating phenylalanine metabolism in the liver
and in the production of biogenic amine neurotransmitters and nitric
oxide.

602647	TITLE *602647 NUCLEAR RNA EXPORT FACTOR 1; NXF1
;;TIP-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; TAP;;
MEX67, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; MEX67
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Segref et al. (1997) identified a yeast gene, MEX67, that encodes a
factor essential for nuclear mRNA export. The Mex67 protein is found at
the nuclear pores, can be UV-crosslinked to polyadenylated RNA, and
interacts with a putative RNA-binding protein in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen. Thus, Segref et al. (1997) suggested that the Mex67 protein
participates directly in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm. They reported that the Mex67 protein is homologous to the
human 'tip-associated protein' (TAP).

The 'tyrosine kinase-interacting protein' (Tip) of herpesvirus saimiri
blocks LCK (153390)-mediated signal transduction and is essential for
primary T cell immortalization and for lymphoma induction in vivo. Using
the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify factors that associate with Tip,
Yoon et al. (1997) cloned a cDNA encoding 'tip-associated protein'
(TAP). The predicted 560-amino acid TAP protein migrates as a 65-kD
protein by SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis indicated that TAP was
expressed as 2.5- and 4.4-kb mRNAs in all tissues tested. Expression of
Tip and TAP in Jurkat-T cells induced cell aggregation, which was likely
caused by the upregulated surface expression of lymphocyte adhesion
molecules, and NF-kappa-B (164011, 164012) activity. Therefore, Yoon et
al. (1997) suggested that TAP is an important cellular mediator of Tip
function in T-cell transformation by herpesvirus saimiri.

GENE FUNCTION

Gruter et al. (1998) reported the identification of TAP as the cellular
factor that specifically binds to the CTE (constitutive transport
element) of the type D retroviruses. Microinjection experiments
performed in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that TAP directly stimulates
CTE-dependent export. Furthermore, TAP overcomes the mRNA export block
caused by the presence of saturating amounts of CTE RNA. Thus, TAP, like
its yeast homolog Mex67, is an mRNA nuclear export mediator. TAP is
therefore a cellular RNA binding protein that is directly involved in
the export of its target RNA.

Using binding analysis, Herold et al. (2000) showed that NXF1, NXF2
(300315), and NXF3 (300316) interact with E1BAP5 (605800), as well as
with NXT1 (605811) and NXT2 (300320). The RBDs of NXF1 and NXF2, but not
that of NXF3, were found to bind RNA. Only NXF1, however, could promote
RNA export mediated by the constitutive transport element of simian type
D retrovirus. Both NXF1 and NXF2, but not NXF3, through their C-terminal
NWD loop, could bind to the nucleoporins CAN (NUP214; 114350), NUP153
(603948), and NUP62 (605815). Only NXF1 could bind to NUP98 (601021).
CAT reporter and Western blot assays showed that coexpression of NXF1 or
NXF2, but not NXF3, with NXT1 or NXT2 activated CAT expression,
suggesting that under these conditions NXF1 can also stimulate RNA
export. The LRRs and NTF2 (605813)-like domains are required for export
activity.

Shamsher et al. (2002) found that transportin-2 (603002) forms complexes
with TAP that strictly depend on the presence of RanGTP. The data
supported the conclusion that transportin-2 participates directly in the
export of a large proportion of cellular mRNAs, and that TAP connects
transportin-2 to mRNAs to be exported.

Li et al. (2006) showed that the TAP gene contains a functional
constitutive transport element (CTE) in its alternatively spliced intron
10. TAP mRNA containing this intron is exported to the cytoplasm and is
present in polyribosomes. A small TAP protein is encoded by this mRNA
and can be detected in human and monkey cells. Li et al. (2006)
concluded that TAP regulates expression of its own intron-containing RNA
through a CTE-mediated mechanism, and that CTEs are likely to be
important elements that facilitate efficient expression of mammalian
mRNAs with retained introns.

FMRP (FMR1; 309550) is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling RNA-binding protein
that participates in mRNA transport and translational control. Using
immunoprecipitation analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Zhang et
al. (2007) showed that Fmrp and Nxf2 were present in Nxf1
mRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein particles in cultured mouse neuronal
cells. Expression of Nxf2 led to destabilization of Nxf1 mRNA, and this
effect was abolished when Fmrp expression was reduced by small
interfering RNA. Zhang et al. (2007) concluded that FMRP and NXF2
collaborate to destabilize NXF1 mRNA.

MAPPING

Using genomic sequence analysis, Herold et al. (2000) mapped the NXF1
gene to chromosome 11 and determined that it contains at least 21 exons.
Hamilton et al. (1997) mapped the Mvb1 locus to proximal mouse
chromosome 19.

Windpassinger et al. (2003) observed that Human Genome Project sequence
data indicated that the NXF1 gene is located on 11q12-q14, the region to
which the locus for Silver spastic paraplegia syndrome (270685) had been
mapped. They excluded NXF1 as the mutant gene, as no mutations were
found on sequence analysis of at least 2 affected individuals from each
of 4 different families and 1 healthy control.

ANIMAL MODEL

In mice, the modifier-of-vibrator-1 locus (Mvb1) controls levels of
correctly processed mRNA from genes mutated by endogenous retrovirus
insertions into introns, including the Pitpn(vb) (600174) tremor
mutation and the Eya1(BOR) (601653) model of human branchiootorenal
syndrome. By positional complementation cloning, Floyd et al. (2003)
identified Mvb1 as the nuclear export factor Nxf1, providing an
unexpected link between the mRNA export receptor and pre-mRNA
processing. Population structure of the suppressive allele in wild Mus
musculus castaneus suggested selective advantage.

;;PORPHOBILINOGEN DEAMINASE; PBGD;;
PRE-UROPORPHYRINOGEN SYNTHASE;;
UROPORPHYRINOGEN I SYNTHASE;;
UROPORPHYRINOGEN I SYNTHETASE
DESCRIPTION Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD; EC 4.3.1.8) is the third enzyme of the
biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of heme. It catalyzes the
synthesis of hydroxymethylbilane by stepwise condensation of 4
porphobilinogen units. Hydroxymethylbilane is then converted to
uroporphyrinogen III by uroporphyrinogen III synthetase (UROS; 606938)
(Raich et al., 1986).

CLONING

Raich et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA clone corresponding to the human
erythrocyte porphobilinogen deaminase gene from a human erythrocyte
library prepared from human spleen. The deduced 334-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of approximately 37.6 kD. Northern blot
analysis identified a single 1.6-kb mRNA transcript.

Grandchamp et al. (1987) determined that there are 2 PBGD isoforms that
differ by approximately 2 kD (40 and 42 kD). One is active in all
tissues and can be isolated from liver, and the other is restricted to
erythrocytes. The nonerythrocyte isoform contains an additional 17 amino
acid residues at the N terminus.

Chretien et al. (1988) demonstrated that the PBGD gene undergoes
alternative splicing with 2 different promoters to yield 2 mRNAs. The
first 'upstream' promoter is active in all tissues and has structural
features of a housekeeping promoter, whereas the second promoter,
located 3 kb downstream, is active only in erythrocytes and shows
structural homology to the beta-globin gene (141900) promoters. The 2
mRNAs differ only in their first exon.

Gubin and Miller (2001) identified 2 alternatively spliced isoforms of
erythroid PBGD in CD34+/- (142230) erythroid precursor cells. Complete
sequencing showed that the alternatively spliced form, designated
PBGD-EA, contained the intron between exons 2 and 3, thus extending the
5-prime untranslated region of the erythroid transcript by 176 bp.
Northern blot analysis identified a distinct 1.5-kb mRNA corresponding
to the alternatively spliced erythrocyte isoform only in bone marrow and
fetal spleen.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chretien et al. (1988) determined that the HMBS gene contains 15 exons
and spans approximately 10 kb of DNA.

The housekeeping HMBS transcript contains exons 1 and 3-15; the
erythroid HMBS transcript is encoded by exons 2-15 (Chen et al., 1994).

MAPPING

By study of mouse-human hybrid clones, Meisler et al. (1980, 1981)
showed that PBG-deaminase is determined by a gene on chromosome 11; Wang
et al. (1981) assigned the locus to the long arm in the segment
11q23-qter. In 3 children with trisomy of 11qter, de Verneuil et al.
(1982) studied expression of uroporphyrinogen I synthase. Dosage effect
supported assignment to the region 11q23.2-qter.

By in situ hybridization and by gene dosage studies in patients with
monosomy or trisomy of the terminal portion of 11q, Namba et al. (1991)
refined the assignment of the PBGD gene to 11q24.1-q24.2.

Tunnacliffe and McGuire (1990) constructed a long-range restriction map
extending over 1.8 Mb of 11q23.3 using pulsed field gel electrophoresis
and concluded that PBGD is situated in the following relation to 5 other
genes: cen--CD3E--CD3D--CD3G--PBGD--CBL2--THY1--qter. They determined
that the CD3G (186740) gene and PBGD are separated by 750 kb.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

By the method of isoelectric focusing, Meisler and Carter (1980)
identified structural variants of PBG-deaminase.

Louie et al. (1992) defined the 3-domain structure of PBGD by x-ray
analysis. Two of the domains structurally resembled the transferrins
(see, e.g., TF; 190000). The x-ray structure and results from
site-directed mutagenesis provided evidence for a single catalytic site.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large Dutch family with the nonerythroid variant of AIP, Grandchamp
et al. (1989) identified a heterozygous splice site mutation in intron 1
of the PBGD gene (609806.0001). The mutation interrupted the sequence
coding for the nonerythroid isoform of PBGD; thus, expression of the
erythroid isoform was unaffected. In a patient with CRM-positive AIP,
Grandchamp et al. (1989) identified a mutation in the HMBS gene,
resulting in the skipping of exon 12 (609806.0002).

In affected members of 11 different families with either CRM-negative or
CRM-positive AIP, Grandchamp et al. (1990) identified 7 different point
mutations in the PBGD gene.

In a patient with the nonerythroid variant of AIP, Chen et al. (1994)
identified a mutation in the initiation codon of the housekeeping HMBS
isoform (M1V; 609806.0044). Puy et al. (1998) identified 3 different
mutations in the donor splice site of the HMBS gene in 4 unrelated
patients with the nonerythroid variant of AIP. They found that the
splice site mutations resulted in activation of a cryptic splice site
located 67 nucleotides downstream from the normal splice site, leading
to a frameshift and premature stop codon in exon 4.

In 28 Finnish families representing 72% of all AIP families in the
Finnish population of 5 million, Kauppinen et al. (1995) found 19
separate mutations in HMBS: 13 novel mutations, including 1 de novo
event, and 6 previously characterized mutations.

Whatley et al. (1999) found 39 different mutations in the HMBS gene in
54 of 57 consecutive patients with AIP.

In patients with the nonerythroid variant of AIP, Whatley et al. (2000)
identified mutations in the housekeeping promoter (-154delG;
609806.0041) and in exon 3 (41delA; 609806.0042) of the HMBS gene.

Floderus et al. (2002) studied most of the AIP kindreds in Sweden. They
identified 27 novel mutations in the HMBS gene, bringing the total
number of known mutations in the HMBS gene in Sweden to 39. Most of the
mutations were located in exons 10 and 12, with fewer in exon 7.
Floderus et al. (2002) used the 3-dimensional structure of the
porphobilinogen deaminase enzyme to predict the possible molecular and
functional consequences of the novel Swedish missense and nonsense
mutations.

In a patient with AIP, Hessels et al. (2004) detected a novel homozygous
leu81-to-pro (L81P) mutation in exon 6 of the HMBS gene (609806.0045).
Porphobilinogen deaminase activity in red cells was decreased to 2 to
4%.

ANIMAL MODEL

Clavero et al. (2010) described a naturally occurring feline model of
AIP in 4 unrelated cat lines that presented phenotypically as congenital
erythropoietic porphyria (CEP; 263700). Affected cats had erythrodontia,
brownish urine, fluorescent bones, and markedly elevated urinary
uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin, consistent with CEP. However, their
UROS activities (deficient in CEP) were normal. Notably, affected cats
had half-normal HMBS activities and elevated urinary 5-aminolevulinic
acid and porphobilinogen. Sequencing the feline Hmbs gene revealed
different mutations in each line, including a duplication, an in-frame
3-bp deletion (842delGAG), and 2 missense (A84T and R149W) mutations.
The 842delGAG and R149W mutations were identical to mutations reported
in human. Prokaryotic expression of the 842delGAG and R149W mutations
resulted in mutant enzymes with less than 1% wildtype activity, whereas
the A84T mutation expressed a stable enzyme with approximately 35% of
wildtype activity. The discolored teeth from the affected cats contained
markedly elevated URO I and III, accounting for the CEP-like phenocopy.
In 3 lines, the phenotype was an autosomal dominant trait, while
affected cats with the A84T mutation were homozygous, a unique recessive
form of AIP.

PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT, NONERYTHROID VARIANT
HMBS, IVS1DS, G-A, +1

In affected members of a large Dutch family with the nonerythroid
variant of acute intermittent porphyria (176000), Grandchamp et al.
(1989) identified a G-to-A transition in the 5-prime splice donor site
of intron 1 of the HMBS gene. The mutation interrupted the sequence
coding for the nonerythroid isoform of PBGD; thus, expression of the
erythroid isoform was unaffected. Hybridization analysis using
oligonucleotide probes after in vitro amplification of genomic DNA
offered another possibility of detecting asymptomatic carriers of the
mutation in affected families.

Puy et al. (1997, 1998) identified this splice site mutation in patients
with nonerythroid variant AIP.

Petrides (1998) identified the G-to-A transition in intron 1 of the HMBS
gene in 9 members of a German kindred in which the proband had a
life-threatening coma due to the nonerythroid variant of AIP. The newly
identified family members were taught how to prevent porphyric attacks.

PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, EX12DEL

In a patient with acute intermittent porphyria (176000), Grandchamp et
al. (1989) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 12 of the HMBS gene,
resulting in the skipping of exon 12. The resulting aberrant mRNA
encoded a truncated protein that was inactive, but stable, and could be
detected using antibodies directed against the normal enzyme
(CRM-positive).

.0003
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT, NONERYTHROID VARIANT
HMBS, IVS1DS, G-T, +1

In a Finnish family with the nonerythroid variant of acute intermittent
porphyria (176000) Grandchamp et al. (1989) identified a G-to-T
transversion in the 5-prime splice donor sequence of intron 1 of the
HMBS gene. This is only 1 nucleotide removed from the mutation listed as
609806.0001, in which the change occurred in the first nucleotide of
intron 1. Grandchamp et al. (1989) proposed that both of these mutations
resulted in an abnormal splicing of primary transcripts initiated at the
upstream promoter of the gene without affecting the expression of the
PBGD gene in erythroid cells where the downstream promoter is utilized.
A similar mutation located at the last position of exon 1 of the
beta-globin gene was found by Vidaud et al. (1989) to be responsible for
a splicing defect leading to beta-thalassemia.

HMBS, ARG116TRP

In affected members of a Swedish family with AIP (176000), Lee et al.
(1990) identified a C-to-T transition in exon 8 of the HMBS gene,
resulting in an arg116-to-trp (R116W) substitution.

The R116W mutation was found by Gu et al. (1993) in 15 Dutch AIP
families and in 1 French AIP family.

(R167Q) substitution.

In a brother and sister with severe AIP (176000), Llewellyn et al.
(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PBGD
gene: a 500G-A transition, resulting in an R167Q substitution, and a
499C-T transition, resulting in an R167W substitution (609806.0013). The
mutations occurred in adjacent nucleotides.

Finnish families with CRM-positive AIP.

HMBS, 1-BP DEL, 900T

In a patient with CRM-positive AIP (176000), Delfau et al. (1991)
identified a 1-bp deletion (900delT) in exon 1 of the HMBS gene,
resulting in a stop codon located 15 codons downstream from the
deletion.

.0011
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, 9-BP DEL, EX10

In a patient with CRM-positive AIP (176000), Delfau et al. (1991)
identified a deletion of the last 9 bp of exon 10. This resulted from
abnormal splicing of intron 10 which was a consequence of a G-to-T
substitution of the last base of exon 10.

.0012
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, TRP198TER

In affected members of a northern Swedish (Lappland) family with AIP
(176000), Lee and Anvret (1991) identified a G-to-A transition in exon
10 of the HMBS gene, resulting in a trp198-to-ter (W198X) substitution.
The same mutation was found in 15 of 33 Swedish AIP families. Genealogic
data showed that 12 of the 15 were related, indicating a founder effect.

.0013
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ARG167TRP

In a brother and sister with severe AIP (176000), Llewellyn et al.
(1992) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PBGD
gene: a 499C-T transition, resulting in an arg167-to-trp (R167W)
substitution, and an adjacent 500G-A transition, resulting in an R167Q
(609806.0005) substitution.

The seemingly high frequency of mutations in exon 10 (Delfau et al.,
1990) prompted Gu et al. (1992) to screen this exon in 41 unrelated AIP
patients by use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) after
PCR amplification. In about one-fourth of the patients, they
distinguished 3 abnormal migration patterns, indicating the presence of
mutation in heterozygous state. Sequencing demonstrated the presence of
3 different single-base substitutions: R167Q, R173Q (609806.0006), and
R167W.

In Finland, Kauppinen et al. (1992) found an R167W mutation in 3 out of
7 families with CRM-positive AIP. DNA analyses of family members
demonstrated that conventional assays of erythrocyte PBGD activity
identified correctly only 72% of the carriers of the mutation.

Solis et al. (2004) reported a Spanish AIP patient who was homozygous
for the R167W substitution. Both parents were heterozygous for the
mutation. The patient had a severe course, with psychomotor delay,
dystonic movements, axial hypotonia, delayed myelination, and death at
age 40 months.

Solis et al. (2004) noted that the R167W, R173Q, and R167Q mutations all
occur at CpG dinucleotides within exon 10, and can thus be considered
mutation hotspots. All 3 substitutions alter highly conserved arginines
in the enzyme's active site, which interact with the precursor
porphobilinogen and the acidic side chains of the enzyme's
dipyrromethane cofactor. Functional expression studies showed that all 3
substitutions resulted in less than 2% normal HMBS activity.

.0014
PORPHYRIA, ACUTE INTERMITTENT
HMBS, ARG167LEU

Using site-directed mutagenesis, Lander et al. (1991) demonstrated that
an arg167-to-leu (R167L) substitution in the HMBS protein resulted in a
profound decrease of PBGD activity, consistent with AIP (176000). It is
noteworthy that substitution of arg167 by glutamine (R167Q; 609806.0005)
and by tryptophan (R167W; 609806.0013) resulted in loss of enzyme
activity.

Nearly 60% of all Swiss AIP patients carry the W283X mutation. In
France, the prevalence of W283X is less than 5% (Schneider-Yin et al.,
2002). In 12 of 25 AIP families of Swiss and French origin,
Schneider-Yin et al. (2002) identified a common haplotype containing the

In a patient with the nonerythroid variant of AIP (176000), Chen et al.
(1994) identified a heterozygous 3G-A transition in exon 1 of the HMBS

was decreased to 2 to 4%. Both parents were heterozygous and
asymptomatic. Leu81 in PBG deaminase is an evolutionarily conserved

Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous R149X
substitution in affected members of the original family with so-called
'Chester type porphyria' (McColl et al., 1985) (see 176000). The
mutation was not found in 200 control chromosomes. The family had
originally been reported as having features of both AIP and variegated
porphyria (VP; 176200), but no mutations in the PPOX gene (600923) were
identified. The mutation occurred at a hypermutable CpG dinucleotide.
The findings confirmed that Chester type porphyria is a variant of AIP.
Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2006) suggested that the original biochemical
studies indicating PPOX deficiency may have been erroneous or
misinterpreted. A different mutation in this codon has also been
associated with AIP (R149Q; 609806.0008).

604634	TITLE *604634 TRANSGELIN 2; TAGLN2
DESCRIPTION By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from a
human immature myeloid cell line, Nagase et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA
encoding TAGLN2, which they called KIAA0120. The deduced 199-amino acid
TAGLN2 protein shares 69.7% amino acid sequence identity with rat
neuronal protein NP25 (607953) over 195 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected TAGLN2 expression in all 16 human tissues examined,
with high expression in lung, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, small
intestine, colon, prostate, testis, ovary, placenta, and peripheral
blood leukocytes, lower expression in skeletal muscle, pancreas, and
heart, and lowest expression in brain.

Stanier et al. (1998) cloned mouse Tagln2 cDNAs. They found that mouse
and human TAGLN2 share 95% amino acid sequence identity.

Using a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel, Nagase et al. (1995)
determined that the TAGLN2 gene maps to either chromosome 1 or 8.
Stanier et al. (1998) noted that an EST cluster representing the TAGLN2
gene had been mapped to 1q21-q25. By linkage analysis, Stanier et al.
(1998) mapped the mouse Tagln2 gene to distal chromosome 1, between the
Fcgr2 gene (146790) and marker D1Mit149. Distal mouse chromosome 1 shows
homology of synteny with human 1q21-q25.

148070	TITLE *148070 KERATIN 18; KRT18
;;K18;;
CYTOKERATIN 18; CYK18
DESCRIPTION Intermediate filaments (IFs) are a structurally related family of
cellular proteins that appear to be intimately involved with the
cytoskeleton. The common structural motif shared by all IFs is a central
alpha-helical 'rod domain' flanked by variable N- and C-terminal
domains. The rod domain, the canonical feature of IFs, has been highly
conserved during evolution. The variable terminals, however, have
allowed the known IFs to be classified into 6 distinct types by virtue
of their differing amino acid sequences (Steinert and Roop, 1988).
Keratins compose types I and II; intermediate filaments desmin,
vimentin, GFAP, and peripherin, type III; neurofilaments, type IV, and
nuclear lamins, type V. Nestin (600915) has been classed as type VI
(Lendahl et al., 1990). The acidic keratins are coded by genes KRT9
(607606) to KRT19 (148020). These genes are located on mouse chromosome
11 and human chromosome 17, except for KRT18 which may be located on
human chromosome 12 (see later). The basic keratins are coded by genes
KRT1 (139350) to KRT8 (148060), which are located on mouse chromosome 15
and human chromosome 12.

Human keratin 18 and the homologous mouse Endo B are type I IF protein
subunits whose expression is restricted in adults to a variety of simple
epithelial tissues. Endo B and its coexpressed type II keratin, Endo A
(the mouse equivalent of human keratin 8), appear to be the first IF
proteins expressed during murine development. Type I and type II
keratins are usually expressed as preferential pairs in equal
proportions in cells, although filaments can be formed in vitro from
heterologous IF subunits. KRT18 is the most divergent of the type I
keratins with N-terminal and C-terminal domains that are quite different
from those of epidermal keratins. According to Kulesh and Oshima (1989),
the genes that code for 12 diverse IF proteins had been cloned and
characterized. Kulesh and Oshima (1989) isolated the human KRT18 gene as
a 10-kb fragment of genomic DNA. Following transfection, the gene was
expressed in several different mouse cell lines including nonepithelial
cells that do not express the homologous endogenous Endo-B gene. The
KRT18 gene is 3,791 bp long and the keratin 18 protein is coded for by 7
exons. The exon structure of KRT18 has been conserved compared to that
of other keratin genes, with the exception of a single 3-prime terminal
exon that codes for the tail domain of the protein that is represented
by 2 exons in epidermal keratins. Waseem et al. (1990) used
human-specific primers from within introns of the published gene
sequence for human type I keratin 18 and PCR to amplify this gene
specifically. By Southern blotting using the genomic DNA PCR product,
they assigned the gene for keratin 18 to chromosome 12. Other human type
I keratins have been assigned to chromosome 17. Waseem et al. (1990)
suggested that the findings indicate the early divergence of the genes
for stratifying cell keratins from that of simple, or embryonic, keratin
18.

By in situ hybridization, Heath et al. (1990) localized a human
cytokeratin 18 cDNA sequence to 17p12-p11. They presented the findings
as evidence for a clustering of cytokeratin genes and related sequences
on the p and q arms of chromosome 17. The findings are, however,
inconsistent with those of Waseem et al. (1990).

By analysis of a YAC contig from 12q13, Yoon et al. (1994) demonstrated
that the KRT18 type I keratin gene is located next to its type II
partner, KRT8, in a cluster of type II keratin genes.

Ku et al. (1995) described transgenic mice that express point-mutant K18
and develop chronic hepatitis and hepatocyte fragility in association
with disruption of hepatocyte keratin filaments. They showed that
transgenic mice expressing mutant K18 are highly susceptible to
hepatotoxicity after acute administration of acetaminophen or chronic
ingestion of griseofulvin. The authors concluded that the predisposition
to hepatotoxicity results directly from the keratin mutation since
nontransgenic or transgenic mice that express normal human K18 are more
resistant. Hepatotoxicity was manifested by a significant difference in
lethality, liver histopathology, and biochemical serum testing. Keratin
glycosylation decreased in all griseofulvin-fed mice, whereas keratin
phosphorylation increased dramatically preferentially in mice expressing
normal K18. The phosphorylation increase in normal K18 after
griseofulvin feeding appeared to involve sites that are different from
those that increased after partial hepatectomy. Ku et al. (1996) stated
that this dramatic phosphorylation increase in nonmutant keratins could
provide survival advantage to hepatocytes. Although the potential for
K18 mutations to cause human disease remain to be investigated, they
considered it possible that K8/18 mutations may not directly cause
disease but may predispose to it; for example, mutations may confer
susceptibility to liver disease upon exposure to an environmental factor
such as a virus or hepatotoxin.

Although mutations had been described in 11 of the more than 20 keratin
intermediate filaments (as the basis of epidermal and oral disorders),
no disease-associated mutations had been described in keratin 8 (KRT8;
148060) or KRT18 until the report by Ku et al. (1997). K8/18 is the
major keratin pair in epithelia of the type found in liver, pancreas,
and intestine. Transgenic mice that express mutant keratin 18, as
already noted, develop chronic hepatitis, and have an increased
susceptibility to drug-induced hepatotoxicity. By studying patients with
liver disease of unknown cause for mutations in KRT18, Ku et al. (1997)
described a his127leu (H127L) KRT mutation in a patient with cryptogenic
cirrhosis (see 215600) that was germline transmitted (148070.0001). The
mutant KRT18 isolated from the liver explant, or after expression in
bacteria, showed an altered migration on 2-dimensional gel analysis as
compared with normal human liver or bacterially expressed KRT18.
Electron microscopy of in vitro assembled mutant KRT18 and wildtype KRT8
showed an assembly defect as compared with normal KRT8/18 assembly. The
results suggested that mutations in KRT18 predispose to cryptogenic
cirrhosis in humans.

Among 120 patients with cirrhosis of undetermined cause (see 215600), Ku
et al. (1997) found 1 patient with a heterozygous A-to-T transversion in
the KRT18 gene that resulted in a his127-to-leu substitution. The
mutation was germline since sequencing of amplified genomic DNA,
isolated from a blood sample of the daughter of the patient, showed the
same H127L mutation in heterozygous form.

Ku et al. (2003) found a his127-to-leu mutation in noncryptogenic
cirrhosis and concluded that the mutation functions as a susceptibility
gene.

609752	TITLE *609752 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COACTIVATOR 7; NCOA7
;;ERAP140
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By Far Western screening of a lymphoma cell cDNA library for estrogen
receptor-alpha (ESR1; 133430)-associated factors, Shao et al. (2002)
identified a novel cDNA, nuclear receptor coactivator-7. NCOA7 encodes a
942-amino acid protein, which the authors called ERAP140 (estrogen
receptor-associated protein of 140 kD). Northern blot analysis revealed
an approximately 5.5-kb transcript in all tumor lines examined,
including ESR-positive and ESR-negative breast cancer cell lines and
HeLa cells. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues revealed
highest expression in brain, with lower expression in mammary gland,
ovary, uterus, prostate, stomach, bladder, spinal cord, and pancreas. In
situ hybridization in mouse tissues demonstrated exclusive expression in
neurons in brain and significant expression in the cortex but not in the
medulla in kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST pull-down assays, Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7
demonstrated a low level of ligand-dependent constitutive binding to
ESR1, ESR2 (see 601663), THRB (190160), PPARG (601487), and RARA
(180240). Binding was further induced by the presence of ligands. NCOA7
did not bind to RXRA (180245) in the presence or absence of ligand.
NCOA7 can enhance the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptors
with which it interacts.

Shao et al. (2002) found that NCOA7 differs from other nuclear receptor
coactivators in that it does not contain an LXXLL receptor-coactivator
interaction motif. Instead it contains a central domain between amino
acids 489 and 559 that mediates ESR1 binding. A leucine at position 523
and/or an isoleucine at position 524 appeared to be essential for the
interaction, and the binding surface appeared to be similar to that of
other coactivators.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shao et al. (2002) demonstrated that the NCOA7 gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 150 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Shao et al. (2002) mapped the NCOA7 gene to
chromosome 6q22.33.

608729	TITLE *608729 ANGIOTENSIN II RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; AGTRAP
;;ATRAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the C-terminal domain of murine At2r1a (106165) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, Daviet et al. (1999) cloned mouse Agtrap from a kidney
cDNA library. The deduced 161-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 17.8 kD. It contains several extensive N-terminal
hydrophobic domains, as well as potential sites for phosphorylation and
N-glycosylation. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of 1.2 and
0.8 kb in all mouse tissues examined, with relatively high levels in
kidney, testis, and heart. PCR also detected Agtrap expression in mouse
aortic tissue and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).

By sequencing clones obtained from a fetal brain cDNA library, followed
by EST database analysis, Wang et al. (2002) cloned human AGTRAP. The
deduced 159-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 17.3
kD. AGTRAP has a 21-amino acid N-terminal transmembrane region that is
followed by a conserved cysteine, which is potentially palmitoylated.
Mouse and human AGTRAP share 74% amino acid homology. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript in almost all tissues examined,
with highest abundance in kidney, heart, pancreas, and thyroid.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Daviet
et al. (1999) confirmed association between mouse Agtrap and At2r1a.
Agtrap interacted specifically with the C-terminal domain of At2r1a, but
not with the C-terminal domains of several other hormone receptors,
including AT2R2 (300034), CHRM3 (118494), BDKRB2 (113503), EDNRB
(131244), and ADRB2 (109690). Overexpression of Agtrap in COS-7 cells
inhibited At2r1a activation of phospholipase C (see 607120). It did not
affect Chrm3 activation.

Cui et al. (2000) determined that transfection of mouse Agtrap into
adult rat VSMCs potentiated At2r1 internalization upon angiotensin II
(see 106150) stimulation. Receptor-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited
in Agtrap-transfected VSMCs, and this was associated with inhibition of
Stat3 (102582) and Akt (see 164730) phosphorylation. Cui et al. (2000)
concluded that AGTRAP is a negative regulator of AT2R1-mediated cell
proliferation in VSMCs.

Using several assays of protein interaction, Wang et al. (2002) showed
that AGTRAP interacted with RACK1 (176981). They suggested that the
AGTRAP-RACK1 interaction may help recruit the signaling complex to AT2R1
and affect receptor signaling.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Guo et al. (2005) demonstrated that mouse
Caml (CAMLG; 601118) interacted with Atrap. The N-terminal hydrophilic
domain of Caml mediated the interaction, and the proteins colocalized in
the endoplasmic reticulum. Atrap knockdown increased NFAT (see NFATC2;
600490) activity, and overexpression of Atrap decreased angiotensin II-
or Caml-induced NFAT transcriptional activation. Overexpression of the
N-terminal ATRAP-interacting domain of Caml increased angiotensin
II-induced NFAT promoter activity, whereas overexpression of the
C-terminal end of Caml disrupted the effect of angiotensin II on NFAT
signaling.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AGTRAP
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-32094).

601447	TITLE *601447 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 5; USP5
;;ISOPEPTIDASE T; ISOT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin (see 191339)-dependent proteolysis is a complex pathway of
protein metabolism implicated in such diverse cellular functions as
maintenance of chromatin structure, receptor function, and degradation
of abnormal proteins. A late step of the process involves disassembly of
the polyubiquitin chains on degraded proteins into ubiquitin monomers.
USP5 disassembles branched polyubiquitin chains by a sequential exo
mechanism, starting at the proximal end of the chain (Wilkinson et al.,
1995).

CLONING

Wilkinson et al. (1995) purified a 93-kD bovine protein with the
properties expected of a polyubiquitin disassembly protein. They
biochemically characterized the enzyme, which they called isopeptidase T
(ISOT), and cloned a cDNA encoding the human homolog (GenBank U35116).
The deduced 835-amino acid human polypeptide has a predicted molecular
mass of 93.3 kD.

Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) generated the genomic sequence of the human
CD4 gene (186940) and its neighboring region on chromosome 12 using the
large-scale shotgun sequencing strategy. A total of 117 kb of genomic
sequence and approximately 11 kb of cDNA sequence was obtained. They
identified in this sequence 8 genes, including CD4 and ISOT. Using a
battery of strategies, the exon/intron boundaries, splice variants, and
tissue expression patterns of the genes were determined. Tissue
expression analysis indicated a high level of expression of a 3.3-kb
ISOT transcript in brain, and a low level of expression in heart, lung,
spleen, and skeletal muscle. Sequence comparison showed that ISOT is a
member of the ubiquitin C-terminal hydroxylase family. Wilkinson et al.
(1995) originally cloned human ISOT and reported the sequence as 3,102
bp long. Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) stated that comparison of their cDNA
sequence with the sequence reported by Wilkinson et al. (1995) indicated
alternative splicing in exon 15. Four nucleotide differences were found
between the 2 sequences resulting in lys-to-arg and gly-to-asp
substitutions. The cDNA and genomic sequences were in full agreement.

Reyes-Turcu et al. (2006) stated that the 835-amino acid human USP5
protein contains 4 putative ubiquitin-binding domains: an N-terminal
zinc finger ubiquitin-binding domain (ZNF-UBP), a ubiquitin-specific
processing protease (UBP) domain formed by noncontiguous regions
containing the active-site cys and his boxes, and 2 ubiquitin-associated
domains (UBA1 and UBA2). UBA1 and UBA2 are located between the cys and
his boxes, which are in the central and C-terminal regions of USP5,
respectively.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Reyes-Turcu et al. (2006) reported the crystal structures of the ZNF-UBP
domain of USP5 alone and in complex with ubiquitin at 2.09-angstrom
resolution. They found that, unlike other ubiquitin-binding domains, the
ZNF-UBP domain contains a deep binding pocket where the C-terminal
diglycine motif of ubiquitin is inserted, thus explaining the
specificity of USP5 for an unmodified C terminus on the proximal subunit
of polyubiquitin. Mutation analysis showed that the ZNF-UBP domain was
required for optimal catalytic activation of USP5.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ansari-Lari et al. (1996) mapped the USP5
gene to chromosome 12p13, near the CD4 gene (186940).

;;TRANS-2-ENOYL-CoA REDUCTASE, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
2-@ENOYL THIOESTER REDUCTASE;;
NUCLEAR RECEPTOR-BINDING FACTOR 1; NRBF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to S. cerevisiae
trans-2-enoyl thioesterase, followed by PCR amplification, Miinalainen
et al. (2003) cloned NRBF1. The deduced 373-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 37 kD. Homologous proteins were identified
in mammalian, nematode, and yeast databases. The mammalian proteins
contain a putative N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal, and all
contain a tyrosine residue critical for catalysis in the yeast enzyme.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb NRBF1 transcript expressed at
highest levels in skeletal and heart muscle. Expression was weaker in
brain, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas, and no expression was
detected in lung. SDS-PAGE showed that purified recombinant NRBF1 had an
apparent molecular mass of about 37 kD. Size exclusion chromatography
estimated a native mass of 65 kD, indicating that NRBF1 forms
homodimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Miinalainen et al. (2003) demonstrated that recombinant NRBF1 reduced
trans-2-enoyl-CoA to acyl-CoA with chain lengths from C6 to C16 in an
NADPH-dependent manner, with preference for medium chain-length
substrates. Furthermore, expression of human NRBF1 in a yeast strain
deficient in 2-enoyl thioester reductase restored mitochondrial
respiratory function and allowed growth on glycerol.

GENE STRUCTURE

Miinalainen et al. (2003) determined that the NRBF1 gene contains 10
exons and spans more than 37 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Miinalainen et al. (2003) mapped the NRBF1
gene to chromosome 1p22.3.

613968	TITLE *613968 TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 60; TAS2R60
;;T2R60
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R60 belongs to the large TAS2R receptor family. TAS2Rs are expressed
on the surface of taste receptor cells and mediate the perception of
bitterness through a G protein-coupled second messenger pathway (summary
by Conte et al., 2002). For further information on the TAS2R gene
family, see 604791.

CLONING

By screening the human genome for sequences related to TAS2Rs, Conte et
al. (2002) cloned TAS2R60, which they called T2R60. The deduced
318-amino acid protein contains the 7-transmembrane structure and short
N- and C-terminal domains conserved in TAS2Rs. The intracellular domains
share significant conservation with other TAS2R family members. TAS2R60
shares highest sequence similarity with TAS2R41 (613965).

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and genomic sequence analyses, Conte et al.
(2002) mapped the TAS2R60 gene to an approximately 3-Mb cluster on
chromosome 7q.

Gross (2011) mapped the TAS2R60 gene to chromosome 7q35 based on an
alignment of the TAS2R60 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY114094) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

604097	TITLE *604097 UROTENSIN II; UTS2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Coulouarn et al. (1998) clearly established the existence of urotensin
II in mammals by characterizing cDNAs encoding the urotensin II
precursors not only in frog but also in human. In both species, the UTS2
sequence is located at the C-terminal position of the precursor. Human
UTS2 is composed of only 11 amino acid residues, while fish and frog
UTS2 possess 12 and 13 amino acid residues, respectively. The cyclic
region of UTS2, which is responsible for the biologic activity of the
peptide, has been fully conserved from fish to human. Northern blot and
dot blot analysis showed that UTS2 precursor mRNAs are found
predominantly in the frog and human spinal cord. In situ hybridization
studies showed that the UTS2 precursor gene is actively expressed in
motoneurons. The fact that evolutionary pressure has acted to conserve
fully the biologically active sequence of UTS2 suggests that the peptide
may exert important physiologic functions in humans.

GENE FUNCTION

Ames et al. (1999) identified a human G protein-coupled receptor, GPR14
(600896), which functions as a urotensin II receptor. Human urotensin II
binds to recombinant human GPR14 with high affinity, and the binding is
functionally coupled to calcium mobilization. Human urotensin II is
found within both vascular and cardiac tissue, including coronary
atheroma, and effectively constricts isolated arteries from nonhuman
primates. The potency of vasoconstriction of urotensin II was an order
of magnitude greater than that of endothelin-1 (131240), making human
urotensin II the most potent mammalian vasoconstrictor identified to
that time. In vivo, human urotensin II markedly increased total
peripheral resistance in anesthetized nonhuman primates, a response
associated with profound cardiac contractile dysfunction. Furthermore,
urotensin II immunoreactivity was found within the central nervous
system and endocrine tissues, suggesting that it may have additional
activities.

UTS2 has several cardiovascular actions, including potent vasoactive,
and cardiac inotropic and hypertropic properties. Douglas et al. (2002)
investigated the degree of expression of UTS2 and its receptor GPR14 in
the myocardium of patients with congestive heart failure. They obtained
specimens of myocardium from the hearts of 19 patients with end-stage
congestive heart failure, 5 patients with early-stage congestive heart
failure, and 8 healthy controls. They found strong expression of UTS2 in
the cardiomyocytes, and to a lesser extent in the vascular smooth muscle
cells, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells of patients with
end-stage congestive heart failure. There was significantly less UTS2
expression in the myocardium of patients with early-stage congestive
heart failure, and little or no UTS2 expression in the myocardium of
healthy controls. RT-PCR showed increased concentrations of UTS2 and the
presence of urotensin receptor mRNA in the myocardium of patients with
congestive heart failure. Confocal microscopy showed a significant
increase in the binding sites for urotensin in the myocardium of
patients with end-stage congestive heart failure.

GENE FAMILY

The caudal neurosecretory system of teleost fish, which terminates in
the urophysis, exhibits morphofunctional similarities to the
hypothalamoneurohypophyseal complex (Bern et al., 1985). Two major
regulatory peptides have been isolated from urophysial extracts and
chemically characterized. Urotensin I, a 41-amino acid peptide, is
structurally similar to mammalian corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF;
122560) and to the frog skin peptide sauvagine; urotensin II (UTS2) is a
cyclic 12-amino acid peptide that has some sequence similarity, but is
not homologous, to somatostatin-14 (see 182450). The characterization of
UTS2 from the urophysis of various teleost species has shown that the
structure of the C-terminal cyclic hexapeptide has been fully conserved,
while several substitutions have occurred in the N-terminal region of
the molecule. Subsequently it was found that urotensin II-like molecules
are present in distant taxa, from mollusks to amphibians, suggesting
that urotensin-related peptides may also occur in mammals. In support of
this hypothesis, a peptide with a high degree of sequence similarity
with UTS1, called urocortin (UCN; 600945), was characterized in the rat
and human brain. In addition, specific binding sites for urotensin II
were demonstrated in rat blood vessels, and fish urotensin II was found
to exert cardiovascular effects in rat and rabbit. It was also found
that the mouse anococcygeus muscle has special sensitivity to urotensin
II (summary by Coulouarn et al., 1998).

600187	TITLE *600187 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 5A; EIF5A
;;EIF5A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The eukaryotic initiation factor 5A is an 18-kD protein composed of 154
amino acids. It contains a unique amino acid residue, hypusine, that is
formed posttranslationally via the transfer and hydroxylation of the
butylamino-group from the polyamine spermidine to a lys50 within the
EIF5A protein. Koettnitz et al. (1994) isolated and characterized the
human EIF5A pseudogene. Subsequently, Koettnitz et al. (1995) identified
a genomic clone encoding a functional EIF5A. The authors showed that
this sequence could successfully complement yeast carrying the HYP2
mutation (the homolog of EIF5A), whereas the pseudogenes could not.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koettnitz et al. (1995) found that the human EIF5A gene contains at
least 4 exons and spans at least 4.8 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Saini et al. (2009) used molecular genetic and biochemical studies to
show that EIF5A promotes translation elongation. Depletion or
inactivation of EIF5A in the yeast S. cerevisiae resulted in the
accumulation of polysomes and an increase in ribosomal transit times.
Addition of recombinant EIF5A from yeast, but not a derivative lacking
hypusine, enhanced the rate of tripeptide synthesis in vitro. Moreover,
inactivation of EIF5A mimicked the effects of the EEF2 (130610)
inhibitor sordarin, indicating that EIF5A might function together with
EEF2 to promote ribosomal translocation. Because EIF5A is a structural
homolog of the bacterial protein EF-P, Saini et al. (2009) proposed that
EIF5A/EF-P is a universally conserved translation elongation factor.

To identify tumor suppressor genes in lymphoma (605027), Scuoppo et al.
(2012) screened a short hairpin RNA library targeting genes deleted in
human lymphomas and functionally confirmed those in a mouse lymphoma
model. Of the 9 tumor suppressors identified, 8 corresponded to genes
occurring in 3 physically linked 'clusters,' suggesting that the common
occurrence of large chromosomal deletions in human tumors reflects
selective pressure to attenuate multiple genes. Among the newly
identified tumor suppressors were adenosylmethionine decarboxylase-1
(AMD1; 180980) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A),
2 genes associated with hypusine, a unique amino acid produced as a
product of polyamine metabolism through a highly conserved pathway.
Through a secondary screen surveying the impact of all polyamine enzymes
on tumorigenesis, Scuoppo et al. (2012) established the
polyamine-hypusine axis as a new tumor suppressor network regulating
apoptosis. Unexpectedly, heterozygous deletions encompassing AMD1 and
eIF5A often occur together in human lymphomas, and cosuppression of both
genes promotes lymphomagenesis in mice. Thus, Scuoppo et al. (2012)
concluded that some tumor suppressor functions can be disabled through a
2-step process targeting different genes acting in the same pathway.

Translation elongation factor P (EF-P) is critical for virulence in
bacteria. EF-P is present in all bacteria and orthologous to archaeal
and eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (a/eIF5A). Ude et al. (2013)
demonstrated that EF-P is an elongation factor that enhances translation
of polyproline-containing proteins: in the absence of EF-P, ribosomes
stall at polyproline stretches, whereas the presence of EF-P alleviates
the translational stalling. Moreover, Ude et al. (2013) demonstrated the
physiologic relevance of EF-P to fine-tune the expression of the
polyproline-containing pH receptor CadC to levels necessary for an
appropriate stress response. Bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cells
have hundreds to thousands of polyproline-containing proteins of diverse
function, suggesting that EF-P and a/elF5A are critical for copy number
adjustment of multiple pathways across all kingdoms of life.

Doerfel et al. (2013) showed that EF-P prevents the ribosome from
stalling during synthesis of proteins containing consecutive prolines,
such as PPG, PPP, or longer proline strings, in natural and engineered
model proteins. EF-P promotes peptide-bond formation and stabilizes the
peptidyl-transfer RNA in the catalytic center of the ribosome. EF-P is
posttranslationally modified by a hydroxylated beta-lysine attached to a
lysine residue. The modification enhances the catalytic proficiency of
the factor mainly by increasing its affinity to the ribosome. Doerfel et
al. (2013) proposed that EF-P and its eukaryotic homolog, elF5A, are
essential for the synthesis of a subset of proteins containing proline
stretches in all cells.

MAPPING

Steinkasserer et al. (1995) mapped the EIF5A gene to 17p13-p12 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Three pseudogenes were mapped to
10q23.3, 17q25, and 19q13.2.

608064	TITLE *608064 KELCH-LIKE 5; KLHL5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wang et al. (2001) cloned a full-length KLHL5 cDNA from a human fetal
brain cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a deduced 755-amino acid protein
that contains a BTB/POZ domain at the N terminus and 6 tandemly arranged
kelch repeats (kelch domain) at the C terminus. Both the BTB and kelch
domains are conserved in members of the kelch protein family. KLHL5
shares 43% sequence identity with the Drosophila Kelch protein, an
oligomeric ring canal actin organizer. It also shares significant
sequence identity with human KLHL2 (605774) and KLHL3 (605775). Northern
blot analysis revealed a single KLHL5 band with high expression in
ovary, adrenal gland, and thyroid, lower expression in prostate, testis,
spinal cord, lymph node, and trachea, and no expression in any other
tissue examined.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2001) mapped the KLHL5 gene to
chromosome 4p15.1-p13.

611610	TITLE *611610 PHOSPHOGLUCOMUTASE 2-LIKE 1; PGM2L1
DESCRIPTION By database searching with the sequence of PGM2 (172000) as query,
Maliekal et al. (2007) identified PGM2L1. The deduced 622-amino acid
PGM2L1 protein has a molecular mass of 72 kD and shares 60% sequence
identity with the PGM2 protein. Sequence analysis suggested that PGM2L1
is a cytosolic protein. Quantitative RT-PCR of mouse tissues showed that
PGM2L1 was mainly expressed in brain where glucose-1,6-bisphosphate
synthase activity was previously shown to be particularly high. High
expression was also detected in testis, and intermediate expression was
found in thymus, spleen, lung, and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

In studies with PGM2 and PGM2L1 in E. coli, Maliekal et al. (2007) found
that PGM2 acted more than 10-fold better as a phosphopentomutase (both
on deoxyribose 1-phosphate and on ribose 1-phosphate) than as a
phosphoglucomutase, while PGM2L1 was about 5- to 20-fold better in
catalyzing the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent synthesis of glucose
1,6-bisphosphate and other aldose-bisphosphates.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PGM2L1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-15948). Scott (2007) mapped the gene to
11q13.4 based on an alignment of the PGM2L1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AB019210) with the genomic sequence (build 36.2).

602859	TITLE *602859 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 10; PEX10
;;PEROXIN 10
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Warren et al. (1998) identified the human ortholog of yeast PEX10.
Okumoto et al. (1998) isolated a human PEX10 cDNA by an expressed
sequence tag (EST) homology search of a human DNA database using yeast
Pex10 from Hansenula polymorpha, followed by screening of a human liver
cDNA library. This cDNA encodes a peroxisomal protein comprising 326
amino acids with 2 putative transmembrane segments and a C3HC4 zinc
finger RING motif. Both the N- and C-terminal regions of the PEX10
protein are exposed to the cytosol, as assessed by an expression study
of epitope-tagged PEX10 protein.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are a group of genetically
heterogeneous, lethal diseases that are characterized by neuronal,
hepatic, and renal abnormalities and severe mental retardation; in their
most severe form, death occurs within the first year of life. Cells from
all PBD patients exhibit decreased import of one or more classes of
peroxisome matrix proteins, a phenotype shared by yeast Pex mutants.
Warren et al. (1998) observed that Pex10 expression rescued peroxisomal
matrix-protein import in PBD patients' fibroblasts from complementation
group 7 (CG7). In addition, they detected mutations on both copies of
PEX10 in 2 unrelated CG7 patients. A Zellweger syndrome (PBD6A; 614870)
patient was homozygous for a donor splice site mutation (602859.0001). A
more mildly affected neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (PBD6B; 614871)
patient was a compound heterozygote for a missense mutation and a
nonsense mutation (602859.0002).

Okumoto et al. (1998) showed that PEX10 expression morphologically and
biochemically restored peroxisome biogenesis in fibroblasts from
Zellweger patients of the complementation group called B in Japan and 7
in the U.S. One patient was found to be homozygous for an inactivating
mutation, a 2-bp deletion immediately upstream of the RING motif, which
resulted in a frameshift, altering 65 amino acids from the normal. This
implied that the C-terminal part, including the RING finger, is required
for biologic function of the PEX10 protein. PEX10 cDNA derived from the
patient with the mutation was defective in peroxisome-restoring activity
when expressed in patient fibroblasts.

Warren et al. (2000) reported phenotype-genotype correlations in
patients with PEX10-deficient peroxisome biogenesis disorder. All 4
PEX10-deficient Zellweger syndrome patients were found to have nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site mutations that removed large portions of the
PEX10 coding region. In contrast, a more mildly affected PEX10-deficient
neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy patient expressed a PEX10 allele with a
missense mutation, H290Q (602859.0002), affecting the C-terminal
zinc-binding domain of the PEX10 product. These results supported the
hypothesis that severe loss-of-function mutations in PEX genes cause
more severe clinical phenotypes, whereas mildly affected PBD patients
have PEX gene mutations that retain residual function.

To quantitate the effects of PEX10 mutations, Warren et al. (2000) used
a functional complementation assay. They observed that nonsense and
frameshift mutations predicted to delete the C-terminal two-thirds
(R125X; 602859.0003) or one-third (704insA) of the protein displayed
nearly normal PEX10 activity. They also found that the unexpectedly high
PEX10 activity displayed by these cDNAs could be eliminated by removing
or mutating segments of the PEX10 cDNA downstream of the mutations.
Although these results demonstrated serious flaws in the PEX10
functional complementation assay, they suggested that the C-terminal
zinc-binding domain is critical for PEX10 function.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2010) reported that Drosophila pex mutants, including Pex2
(170993), Pex10, and Pex12 (601758), faithfully recapitulated several
key features of human PBD, including impaired peroxisomal protein
import, elevated very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) levels, and growth
retardation. Moreover, disruption of pex function resulted in
spermatogenesis defects, including spermatocyte cytokinesis failure in
Drosophila. Increased VLCFA levels enhanced these spermatogenesis
defects whereas reduced VLCFA levels alleviated them. Chen et al. (2010)
concluded that regulation of proper VLCFA levels by pex genes is crucial
for spermatogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX10, IVS, G-A, +1

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group 7 (PBD6A;
614870), Warren et al. (1998) found homozygosity for a splice donor-site
mutation in the PEX10 gene that resulted in exon skipping and loss of
407 bp from the PEX10 open reading frame. The change was a G-to-A
transition in the first position of the splice-donor site in an intron
that lies downstream from a 407-bp exon. This mutation corresponded to a
C-to-T transition at a CpG dinucleotide on the antisense strand. The
homozygous nature of this allele, which destroyed an SnaBI site, was
confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of an amplified genomic DNA
fragment spanning the mutation. The PEX10-deficient cells of this
patient contained many peroxisomes and imported peroxisomal membrane
proteins but did not import peroxisomal matrix proteins, indicating that
the loss of PEX10 has its most pronounced effect on peroxisomal matrix
protein import.

.0002
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6B
PEX10, HIS290GLN

In a mildly affected neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (see PBD6B, 614871)
patient, Warren et al. (1998) found compound heterozygosity for a
missense mutation in the PEX10 zinc-binding domain, his290 to gln, and
for a nonsense mutation, arg125 to stop (602859.0003). The 2 alleles
encoded partially functional PEX10 proteins.

.0004
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX10, 2-BP DEL, 814CT

In cells from a patient with Zellweger syndrome of complementation group
7 (PBD6A; 614870), Okumoto et al. (1998) found homozygosity for an
inactivating mutation, a 2-bp deletion at nucleotides 814 and 815 (CT).

The only diagnostic center for PBDs in Japan identified a total of 31
Japanese patients with PBD during the 20 years previous to the report of
Shimozawa et al. (2003). There were 27 patients with Zellweger syndrome,
including 2 sibs, 3 with neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD; see
601539), and 1 with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP; see
215100). No patient with infantile Refsum disease (IRD; see 601539) had
been detected. All 11 patients with Zellweger syndrome of
complementation group B had the same mutation, the homozygous 2-bp
deletion in PEX10: 814-815delCT. Analysis of single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) within PEX10 showed that the mutation probably
arose once on an ancestral chromosome in the Japanese population.

.0005
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 6A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX10, 1 BP-INS, 704A

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome (PBD6A; 614870), their patient
PBD117, Warren et al. (2000) found compound heterozygosity for an A
insertion following nucleotide 704 in exon 4 of the PEX10 cDNA and a
deletion/insertion/frameshift mutation (602859.0006) in exon 1 of the
genome DNA, resulting in loss of nucleotides 13 to 28 of the open
reading frame and replacement of these 16 basepairs by a 20-bp
insertion. The product of the second allele contained the first 4 amino
acids of PEX10 followed by an additional 46 residues and a termination
codon; there was no evidence of PEX10 mRNA expression from the second
allele.

614143	TITLE *614143 IGF-LIKE FAMILY RECEPTOR 1; IGFLR1
;;TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 149; TMEM149
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IGFLR1 is a receptor for IGFL1 (610544), which is upregulated in
psoriatic skin and in keratinocytes treated with TNF (191160) (Lobito et
al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human protein microarray with IGFL1, Lobito et al. (2011)
identified IGFLR1. The deduced 355-amino acid transmembrane protein has
an extracellular domain containing 12 conserved cysteines and a
conserved cytoplasmic region containing a putative death domain. IGFLR1
is conserved in mammals and fish. Sequence and structural analyses
indicated that IGFLR1 is a TNF receptor family member that is specific
for IGFL ligands. RT-PCR analysis of mouse tissues showed ubiquitous
expression of Igflr1, with highest expression in lymph node. RT-PCR of
sorted mouse splenocytes revealed highest expression of Igflr1 in T
cells. FACS analysis demonstrated surface expression of human IGFLR1 on
transfected cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening and reverse screening of a human protein microarray, Lobito
et al. (2011) confirmed that IGFLR1 interacted with IGFL1. IGFL3
(610546), though only 37% identical to IGFL1, also bound tightly to
IGFLR1. IGFL2 (610545) bound IGFLR1 more weakly, but IGFL4 (610547) did
not interact with IGFLR1.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the IGFLR1 gene to chromosome 19q13.12 based on an
alignment of the IGFLR1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC031329) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;SCOTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding Scotin, which they called
HSPC217, from CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. The deduced 170-amino acid protein contains an MYB (189990)
DNA-binding domain repeat signature. Microarray analysis of 5
hematopoietic cell lines detected low-level expression of Scotin in NB4
and Jurkat cells, but no expression was detected in HL60, K562, and U937
cells.

Bourdon et al. (2002) identified mouse Scotin by differential display of
spleen and thymus of normal and p53 (191170) null mice after gamma
irradiation of whole animals. The induced 1.85-kb transcript encodes a
deduced 235-amino acid protein. By searching an EST database using the
mouse sequence as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bourdon
et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Scotin from a placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 240-amino acid human protein shares 70%
identity with mouse Scotin. Both the human and the mouse proteins
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a central transmembrane domain
composed of 18 hydrophobic amino acids, and a proline/tyrosine domain,
and both show an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western blot
analysis. Immunolocalization of exogenously expressed Scotin revealed
colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. By mutation
analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the proline-rich domain
is required for ER localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bourdon et al. (2002) noted that mouse thymus and spleen cells underwent
massive p53-dependent apoptosis following ultraviolet irradiation or
exposure to actinomycin D. They found that Scotin mRNA was induced
coincident with apoptosis and was expressed only in spleen and thymus of
irradiated wildtype mice and not in the spleen or thymus of irradiated
p53 null mice. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they
confirmed direct binding between p53 and Scotin, and using a luciferase
reporter plasmid driven by the mouse Scotin promoter, they confirmed
dose-dependent p53 transactiviation. Furthermore, Bourdon et al. (2002)
showed that the apoptosis induced by the p53/Scotin pathway is caspase
dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the
human Scotin gene contains 6 exons. They identified a p53-responsive
element of 9 decamers within the mouse Scotin promoter.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the human
Scotin gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et
al. (2002) mapped the Scotin gene to chromosome 3p21.3. They also
identified a Scotin pseudogene on chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

603083	TITLE *603083 HETEROGENEOUS NUCLEAR RIBOPROTEIN L; HNRNPL
;;HNRPL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes contain hnRNAs
and their associated proteins and are directly involved in mRNA
synthesis and maturation. hnRNP complexes contain more than 20 major
proteins, including the group A, B, and C core proteins and a more
heterogeneous population of larger polypeptides, such as HNRNPL
(Pinol-Roma et al., 1989).

CLONING

Pinol-Roma et al. (1989) noted that among the major polypeptides
associated with hnRNA in HeLa cells is a set of 2 distinct,
approximately 68-kD proteins, designated HNRPL and HNRPM (HNRPNM;
160994). By UV crosslinking proteins to RNA and by sedimentation
analysis before and after RNase digestion, Pinol-Roma et al. (1989)
demonstrated with a monoclonal antibody against HNRPL that HNRPL is
stably associated with hnRNP complexes. They also showed that HNRPL is
present in the nucleoplasm, in 1 to 3 unidentified discrete nonnucleolar
structures, and outside hnRNP complexes. The authors detected HNRPL in
various vertebrates and found that HNRPL is associated with most nascent
transcripts on the lampbrush chromosomes of the newt N. viridescens.
Pinol-Roma et al. (1989) screened a HeLa cell cDNA expression library
with serum containing antibodies against hnRNPs and isolated a cDNA
encoding HNRPL. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately 2.3-kb
HNRPL transcript in HeLa cells. The predicted 558-amino acid protein is
glycine- and proline-rich and has a calculated molecular weight of
60,187 Da. HNRPL contains 2 segments of approximately 80 amino acids
each that are weakly related to each other and to the ribonucleoprotein
consensus sequence-type RNA-binding domains of other hnRNP and snRNP
proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Translational repression of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1, or SLC2A1;
138140) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; 137800) is mediated by a
specific RNA-binding protein that interacts with an AU-rich response
element in the 3-prime UTR of the GLUT1 transcript. Hamilton et al.
(1999) showed that HNRNPA2 (600124) and HNRNPL bound the 3-prime UTR of
GLUT1 mRNA. Induction of brain ischemia in rats or hypoglycemic stress
in 293 cells increased GLUT1 expression via mRNA stability. Polysomes
isolated from ischemic rat brains or hypoglycemic 293 cells showed loss
of HNRNPA2 and HNRNPL, suggesting that reduced levels of these
RNA-binding proteins results in GLUT1 mRNA stability.
Immunoprecipitation of polysomes from activated human T lymphocytes
suggested that HNRNPA2 and HNRNPL form a complex in vivo.

Ray et al. (2009) reported an RNA switch in the human VEGFA (192240)
mRNA 3-prime untranslated region (UTR) that integrates signals from
IFN-gamma (107570) and hypoxia to regulate VEGFA translation in myeloid
cells. Analogous to riboswitches, the VEGFA 3-prime UTR undergoes a
binary conformational change in response to environmental signals.
However, the VEGFA 3-prime UTR switch is metabolite-independent, and the
conformational change is dictated by mutually exclusive,
stimulus-dependent binding of proteins, namely, the IFN-gamma-activated
inhibitor of translation complex and HNRNPL. Ray et al. (2009)
speculated that the VEGFA switch represents the founding member of a
family of signal-mediated, protein-dependent RNA switches that evolved
to regulate gene expression in multicellular animals in which the
precise integration of disparate inputs may be more important than the
rapidity of response.

121013	TITLE *121013 GAP JUNCTION PROTEIN, ALPHA-5; GJA5
;;GAP JUNCTION PROTEIN, 40-KD;;
CONNEXIN 40; CX40
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Connexin proteins oligomerize to form intercellular channels, called gap
junctions, through which ions and small molecules move between adjacent
cells. See 121011 for a general discussion of the connexin gene family.

CLONING

Kanter et al. (1992) demonstrated that canine ventricular myocytes
express 3 distinct gap junction proteins, Cx40, Cx43 (GJA1; 121013), and
Cx45. Kanter et al. (1994) used PCR with primers based on rat and dog
Cx40 to clone human CX40. The CX40 gene encodes a predicted 358-amino
acid protein whose sequence is 82% identical to that of the rat and
mouse CX40 protein. Northern blot analysis showed that CX40 mRNA is
expressed as an approximately 3.3-kb transcript in ventricular
myocardium. In immunofluorescence studies, CX40 localized to
intercalated disc regions of the left ventricle, which join cardiac
myocytes and contain gap junctions.

Kaba et al. (2001) noted that cardiac myocytes are electrically coupled
via gap junctions. Immunohistochemical staining of embryonic mouse and
human fetal hearts localized CX40 at the superficial zones of trabeculae
in developing ventricles. As development progressed, CX40 became largely
confined to the conduction system.

By searching EST databases, Dupays et al. (2003) identified 2 CX40
splice variants that differed only in the 5-prime untranslated region.
RT-PCR detected expression of the transcript utilizing exon 1A in
endothelial cells, and the transcript utilizing exon 1B in normal
placental cytotrophoblasts and in malignant cytotrophoblastic cell
lines. Both transcripts were expressed in right atrial appendages and in
all heart regions investigated, with higher levels in atrium.
Transcripts including exon 1A predominated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dupays et al. (2003) determined that the CX40 gene contains 3 exons,
which they designated 1A, 1B, and 2. Exons 1A and 1B are alternate
5-prime untranslated regions that appear to induce cell type-specific
expression, and exon 2 is the coding exon. The entire gene spans about
25 kb. The DNA sequence upstream of exon 1A contains 7 SP1
(189906)-binding sites and potential binding sites for transcription
factors that control vascular gene expression, such as ETS1 (164720) and
GATA (see 305371), but no TATA or CAAT box. The region upstream of exon
1B is preceded by 3 CAAT boxes, 2 SP1-binding sites, and multiple
binding sites for the basal transcription factors AP1 (see Jun, 165160)
and AP4 (600743). Kanter et al. (1994) had noted 1 coding exon and a
5-prime untranslated exon, corresponding to exon 1A, in the CX40 genomic
sequence.

Seul et al. (1997) characterized the structure of the mouse Cx40 gene.

MAPPING

Willecke et al. (1990) used a mouse cDNA probe in Southern analysis of
mouse-human somatic cell hybrids to map the human CX40 and CX37 (GJA4)
genes to 1pter-q12.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Gelb et al. (1997) mapped the
GJA5 gene to chromosome 1q21.1 in a region that shows homology of
synteny with mouse chromosome 3, where the mouse Gja5 gene maps.

GENE FUNCTION

The migration of lymphocytes from the circulation into tissues involves
a number of adhesion molecules and the expression of new molecules. Gap
junctions facilitate cell-to-cell adhesion and provide pathways for
direct intercellular communication. Oviedo-Orta et al. (2000) noted that
GJA1 is expressed in a number of lymphoid organs. By RT-PCR, Western
blot, and flow cytometric analyses, they showed that lymphocytes express
GJA1 and GJA5, but not GJB2 (121011), GJB1 (304040), GJA4 (121012), or
GJA7 (608655); GJA5 expression was restricted to tonsillar T and B
lymphocytes. Flow cytometric analysis showed that GJA1 and GJA5
expression increases after mitogenic stimulation. Extracellular connexin
mimetic peptide blocked dye transfer between lymphocyte subpopulations,
and gap junction inhibitors decreased the production of IgM in
cocultured T and B lymphocytes. The results identified gap junction
proteins as important cell surface components that modulate immune
responses.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Atrial Standstill

Groenewegen et al. (2003) reported a family in which 1 deceased and 3
living members had atrial standstill (108770). They identified a
mutation (D1275N; 600163.0034) in the SCN5A gene in all 3 affected
living members and in 5 unaffected members; the deceased member was an
obligate carrier. Several family members were found to have 2 closely
linked polymorphisms within regulatory regions of the GJA5 gene: a
-44G-A transition and a 71A-G transition. Only the 3 affected living
members coinherited the SCN5A mutation and the 2 rare GJA5
polymorphisms. Functional analysis demonstrated a 65% reduction in
promoter activity with the rare -44A/+71G GJA5 haplotype compared to the
more common -44G/+71A haplotype. Groenewegen et al. (2003) proposed that
atrial standstill in this family resulted from coinheritance of the
SCN5A mutation and the rare GJA5 polymorphisms.

- Familial Atrial Fibrillation 11

Gollob et al. (2006) presented evidence that tissue-specific mutations
in the GJA5 gene may predispose the atria to fibrillation. They
sequenced the GJA5 gene from genomic DNA isolated from resected cardiac
tissue and peripheral lymphocytes from 15 patients with idiopathic
atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; new). Four novel heterozygous missense
mutations (see, e.g., 121013.0001-121013.0002) were identified in 4 of
the 15 patients. In 3 patients, the mutations were found in cardiac
tissue specimens but not in lymphocytes, indicating a somatic source of
the genetic defects. In the fourth patient, the sequence variant was
detected in both cardiac tissue and lymphocytes, suggesting a germline
origin. Analysis of the expression of mutant proteins revealed impaired
intracellular transport or reduced intercellular electrical coupling.

Yang et al. (2010) performed direct sequencing of the coding region of
the GJA5 gene in 126 unrelated Chinese probands with familial atrial
fibrillation (AF) and identified a heterozygous nonsense mutation in 1
proband (121013.0003) that segregated with disease in the family.

Yang et al. (2010) analyzed the GJA5 gene in 218 unrelated Chinese
probands with AF and identified 3 heterozygous missense mutations in 3
probands (121013.0004-121013.0006, respectively). The mutations, which
all occurred at evolutionarily conserved residues, segregated with
disease in each family and were not found in 200 ethnically matched
controls.

Wirka et al. (2011) tested 8 SNPs within the CX40 region for association
with CX40 levels measured in atrial tissue from 61 individuals who had
undergone cardiac surgery, 85.2% of whom had a history of AF and 49.2%
of whom had AF at the time of surgery. The previously described CX40
promoter 'A' SNP dbSNP rs35594137 (-44G-A), which was in perfect linkage
disequilibrium with the SNP dbSNP rs1152588 (71A-G) in exon 1A, was not
associated with CX40 mRNA levels. However, a common SNP dbSNP rs10465885
located within the TATA box of an alternative CX40 promoter (promoter
'B') in exon 1B was strongly associated with CX40 mRNA expression (p
less than 0.0001) and displayed strong and consistent allelic expression
imbalance in human atrial tissue. A promoter-luciferase assay in culture
mouse cardiomyocytes demonstrated reduced activity of the promoter
containing the minor allele of this SNP (p less than 0.0001). Testing of
both dbSNP rs35594137 and dbSNP rs10465885 for association with
early-onset lone AF (onset at less than 60 years of age) in 384 cases
and 3,010 controls revealed that the promoter B SNP dbSNP rs10465885 was
associated with early-onset lone AF (odds ratio, 1.18; p = 0.046), and
metaanalysis of 2 additional early-onset lone AF case-control cohorts
confirmed the association (odds ratio, 1.16; p = 0.022) with dbSNP
rs10465885. The promoter A SNP dbSNP rs35594137, however, was not
associated with the lone AF phenotype in any of the cohorts studied or
in a combined analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gu et al. (2003) generated Cx40 +/- and -/- mice to study the role of
CX40 in cardiac morphogenesis. The overall incidence of cardiac
malformations was 18% in heterozygotes and 33% in homozygotes; the
malformations were more severe in homozygotes, and the incidence of
malformations was even higher (44%) in the offspring of -/- matings. The
most common malformations were of conotruncal origin, but endocardial
cushion defects and other malformations were also found. Gu et al.
(2003) concluded that CX40 is not essential for cardiogenesis, but its
absence or limited expression increases the probability of cardiac
malformations.

To study the role of gap junction communication in cardiac conduction,
Simon et al. (1998) generated Cx40 null mice. Using electrocardiographic
analysis, they showed that the null mice had cardiac conduction
abnormalities characteristic of first-degree atrioventricular block with
associated bundle branch block. Simon et al. (1998) concluded that gap
junctions are essential for the rapid conduction of impulses in the
His-Purkinje system.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 11
GJA5, ALA96SER

In both atrial tissue and lymphocytes from a 41-year-old male with
atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; 614049), Gollob et al. (2006) identified a
286G-T transversion in the GJA5 gene, predicted to cause an ala96-to-ser
(A96S) substitution. The variant was absent in the patient's 3 sibs and
wife but was present in his 2 sons, who had no history of atrial
fibrillation; however, on surface electrocardiography, the carrier sons
had an abnormally prolonged P-wave duration (more than 120 ms), a known
predictor of atrial fibrillation (Dilaveris et al., 1998). The variant
was also identified in lymphocyte DNA from a 48-year-old control subject
(population frequency, 0.6%). Gollob et al. (2006) noted that long-term
follow-up of asymptomatic persons carrying the ser96 allele was needed
to determine the clinical significance of the variant.

.0002
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, SOMATIC
GJA5, PRO88SER

In 2 unrelated subjects with atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; 614049),
Gollob et al. (2006) identified a 262C-T transition in the GJA5 gene,
predicted to cause a pro88-to-ser (P88S) substitution. The mutation was
detected in atrial tissue but not in lymphocytes, indicating a probable
somatic mutation. Gollob et al. (2006) noted that the pro88 residue,
located in the second transmembrane domain of connexin-40, is highly
conserved in mammalian and zebrafish connexins.

.0003
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 11
GJA5, GLN49TER

In 7 affected members of a Chinese family with paroxysmal or persistent
atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; 614049), Yang et al. (2010) identified
heterozygosity for a 145C-T transition in the GJA5 gene, resulting in a
gln49-to-ter (Q49X) substitution that was predicted to cause premature
termination and deletion of 3 transmembrane domains, 3 loop regions, and
the C terminus. The mutation was detected in 6 additional affected
family members, but was not found in 6 unaffected family members or in
200 ethnically matched controls.

.0004
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 11
GJA5, VAL85ILE

In affected members of a 3-generation Chinese family segregating
autosomal dominant atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; 614049), Yang et al.
(2010) identified heterozygosity for a 253G-A transition in the GJA5
gene, resulting in a val85-to-ile (V85I) substitution at a highly
conserved residue within the second transmembrane domain. The mutation
was not found in 4 unaffected relatives or in 200 ethnically matched
controls.

.0005
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 11
GJA5, LEU221ILE

In affected members of a 2-generation Chinese family segregating
autosomal dominant atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; 614049), Yang et al.
(2010) identified heterozygosity for a 661C-A transversion in the GJA5
gene, resulting in a leu221-to-ile (L221I) substitution at a highly
conserved residue within the fourth transmembrane domain. The mutation
was not found in 4 unaffected relatives or in 200 ethnically matched
controls.

.0006
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 11
GJA5, LEU229MET

In affected members of a 3-generation Chinese family segregating
autosomal dominant atrial fibrillation (ATFB11; 614049), Yang et al.
(2010) identified heterozygosity for a 685C-A transversion in the GJA5
gene, resulting in a leu229-to-met (L229M) substitution at a highly
conserved residue within the cytoplasmic region near the fourth
transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in 4 unaffected
relatives or in 200 ethnically matched controls.

611412	TITLE *611412 N-ACETYLNEURAMINATE PYRUVATE LYASE; NPL
;;CHROMOSOME 1 OPEN READING FRAME 13; C1ORF13;;
DIHYDRODIPICOLINATE SYNTHASE;;
C112
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase (EC 4.1.3.3) controls the cellular
concentration of sialic acid by catalyzing the conversion of sialic acid
into acylmannosamines and pyruvate (Wu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1 associated with
hereditary prostate cancer (HPC1; 601518), followed by screening cDNA
libraries, Sood et al. (2001) cloned NPL, which they called C112. The
deduced protein contains 320 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected weak expression of a 5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined.

By large-scale sequence analysis of clones obtained from a fetal brain
cDNA library, Wu et al. (2005) cloned a splice variant of NPL. The
deduced 301-amino acid splice variant, which they called NPLV2, contains
an N-terminal dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) domain and 5 putative
N-terminal phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected highest expression in
liver, kidney, and peripheral blood leukocytes, and lower expression in
placenta, pancreas, spleen, thymus, ovary, and small intestine. By
database analysis, Wu et al. (2005) identified 3 other NPL splice
variants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (2005) determined that the NPL gene contains 11 exons and
spans over 40 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sood et al. (2001) mapped the NPL gene to
chromosome 1q25.

;;STELLA, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
PRIMORDIAL GERM CELL PROTEIN 7; PGC7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening for genes expressed in a sex-specific manner during early
embryonic gonadal development in the mouse, Bowles et al. (2003) cloned
Dppa3. The deduced protein contains 150 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected a 1.2-kb transcript expressed in male mouse gonads at
13.5 days postcoitum. In situ hybridization of whole mouse embryos
showed Dppa3 expressed initially in the gonads of both sexes, but
expression was downregulated in female gonads by at least 13.5 days
postcoitum. Embryonic mice deficient in germ cells did not express
Dppa3. Bowles et al. (2003) identified human DPPA3, which encodes a
160-amino acid protein. EST database searches revealed that human DPPA3
expression had been detected only in germ cell tumors, but not in normal
testis.

GENE FUNCTION

West et al. (2009) differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a
Stella transgenic reporter into putative primordial germ cells (PGCs) in
vitro. The Stella-positive cells possessed a transcriptional profile
similar to embryo-derived PGCs, and like their counterparts in vivo,
lost imprints in a time-dependent manner. Using inhibitory RNAs to
screen candidate genes for effects on the development of Stella-positive
cells in vitro, West et al. (2009) found that Lin28 (611043), a negative
regulator of let7 (605386) microRNA processing, is essential for proper
PGC development. Furthermore, Blimp1 (PRDM1; 603423), a let7 target and
a master regulator of PGC specification, rescued the effect of Lin28
deficiency during PGC development, thereby establishing a mechanism of
action for Lin28 during PGC specification. Overexpression of Lin28
promotes formation of Stella-positive cells in vitro and PGCs in
chimeric embryos, and is associated with human germ cell tumors.

Nakamura et al. (2012) showed that PGC7 protects 5-methylcytosine (5mC)
from Tet3 (613555)-mediated conversion to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)
by binding to maternal chromatin containing dimethylated histone H3
lysine-9 (H3K9me2) in mice. In addition, imprinted loci that are marked
with H3K9me2 in mature sperm are protected by PGC7 binding in early
embryogenesis. Nakamura et al. (2012) suggested that this type of
regulatory mechanism could be involved in DNA modifications in somatic
cells as well as in early embryos.

MAPPING

Bowles et al. (2003) identified the DPPA3 gene on chromosome 12p13.31.
They stated that the mouse Dppa3 gene maps to chromosome 6F2 in a region
that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 12p13.31.

611984	TITLE *611984 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S21; MRPS21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS21 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS21. The deduced 87-amino acid MRPS21 protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 10.7 kD. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS21 orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, yeast, and E. coli.
Highest conservation is in the N-terminal and central regions of MRPS21
orthologs. Mouse and human MRPS21 share 90.8% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPS21 gene to chromosome 1q21. Zhang
and Gerstein (2003) identified 9 MRPS21 pseudogenes scattered throughout
the genome.

615196	TITLE *615196 SHORT-CHAIN DEHYDROGENASE/REDUCTASE FAMILY, MEMBER 4-LIKE 2; DHRS4L2
;;DHRS4-LIKE 2;;
DHRS4P1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes, like DHRS4 (611596), are
NAD/NADP-dependent oxidoreductases that function in the breakdown of
steroids, retinoids, prostaglandins, and xenobiotics. DHRS4L2 arose by
duplication of the DHRS4 gene (summary by Gabrielli and Tofanelli,
2012).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of human neuroblastoma cell lines, Zhang et al. (2009) cloned
8 DHRS4L2 splice variants that originated from an alternative upstream
first exon. Database analysis revealed expression of DHRS4L2 from the
upstream exon in several normal human tissues, including brain,
placenta, and testis. RT-PCR confirmed abundant expression from the
upstream exon in testis, with much lower expression in other tissues
examined. RNA structural analysis of 2 of the variants suggested that
they are noncoding.

Gabrielli and Tofanelli (2012) reported that DHRS4L2, which they called
DHRS4P1, is transcribed, but that it contains a frameshift and stop
signal in exon 6 compared with DHRS4, which terminates in exon 8. The
deduced DHRS4L2 protein shares significant identity with the N-terminal
210 amino acids of DHRS4, but it lacks the C-terminal region of DHRS4.
Gabrielli and Tofanelli (2012) suggested that DHRS4L2 may be a
transcribed pseudogene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2009) determined that the DHRS4L2 gene contains 9 exons,
including 2 alternative first exons associated with alternative
promoters. The region upstream of exon 1 contains TATA and CCAAT boxes
and CpG islands.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2009) mapped the DHRS4L2
gene near the DHRS4 gene on chromosome 14q11.2.

607081	TITLE *607081 TAP-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE; TAPBPL
;;TAP-BINDING PROTEIN-RELATED PROTEIN; TAPBPR;;
TAPBP-RELATED PROTEIN;;
TAPASIN-RELATED PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tapasin, or TAPBP (601962), is a member of the variable-constant Ig
superfamily that links major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
molecules to the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP;
see 170260) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The TAPBP gene is located
near the MHC complex on chromosome 6p21.3. TAPBPL is a member of the Ig
superfamily that is localized on chromosome 12p13.3, a region somewhat
paralogous to the MHC.

CLONING

By database searching with TAPBP as the probe, PAC clone analysis, and
5-prime RACE, Teng et al. (2002) identified a cDNA encoding TAPBPR. The
deduced 468-amino acid protein is 22% identical to TAPBP. It contains an
N-terminal signal sequence, a region weakly similar to an Ig-like or
fibronectin (FN1; 135600)-like domain, an IgV domain, an IgC1 domain, a
transmembrane region, and a 42-residue cytoplasmic tail with no ER
retention motif. Unlike TAPBP, TAPBPR does not have a conserved class I
molecule-binding region in its N terminus. RT-PCR analysis detected wide
expression in mouse tissues, with raised levels in kidney, adipose
tissue, salivary gland, placenta, ovary, and gut tissue. Fluorescence
microscopy demonstrated expression primarily in the ER, but also on the
cell surface. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis supported the
presence of a surface-expressed 52-kD protein, corresponding to the
predicted size. Teng et al. (2002) concluded that TAPBPR may be retained
in the ER by an unknown mechanism.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Teng et al. (2002) determined that the
TAPBPR gene contains 7 exons and spans 10 kb. Like TAPBP, TAPBPR lacks
TATA and CAATT boxes in the promoter region. In contrast to TAPBP,
TAPBPR also lacks gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) induction elements, a
finding supported by functional analysis.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Teng et al. (2002) localized the TAPBPL
gene to chromosome 12p13.3 between the CD27 (TNFRSF7; 186711) and VAMP1
(185880) genes.

601140	TITLE *601140 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 14B; PPP1R14B
;;PHOSPHOLIPASE C, BETA-3, NEIGHBORING GENE OF; PLCB3N;;
PNG
DESCRIPTION Using a cosmid that contained the gene for phospholipase C-beta-3
(PLCB3; 600230), Lagercrantz et al. (1996) isolated and characterized a
gene that they called PLCB3-neighboring gene (PNG). PLCB3 is located on
11q13. PNG had no striking similarity to other known genes at the DNA
level, however, analysis of hybridization to a panel of somatic cell
hybrids indicated the existence of related sequences on chromosomes 2,
4, 7, and 22. PNG showed expression of a 1-kb message in multiple
tissues. The predicted protein is 119 amino acids long. The gene spans
approximately 2.5 kb and is divided into 4 exons and 3 introns. It is
located 4.4 kb upstream of PLCB3, with the 5-prime ends of each gene
facing each other. The intragenic region showed separate CpG islands at
each end separated by a stretch of 2 kb, characterized by periodic
alteration of the GC content. A 5-prime flanking region of PNG did not
contain TATA or CCAAT, suggesting to the authors a housekeeping promoter
structure.

Lagercrantz et al. (1996) described isolation and expression of the
murine homolog. The predicted murine protein contains 203 amino acids.

600264	TITLE *600264 ARGININE VASOPRESSIN RECEPTOR 1B; AVPR1B
;;ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE, RECEPTOR FOR, V1B;;
VASOPRESSIN V1B RECEPTOR;;
PITUITARY VASOPRESSIN RECEPTOR 3; AVPR3
DESCRIPTION The neurohypophyseal hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) induces diverse
actions, including stimulation of hepatic glycogenolysis, contraction of
vascular smooth muscle cells and mesangial cells, antidiuresis in the
kidney, and aggregation of platelets. These actions of AVP are mediated
through specific G protein-coupled receptors. AVP receptors are
classified into at least 3 subtypes: V1a, V1b, and V2. The V1a receptor
(600821) has been localized in the liver, vascular smooth muscle, brain,
mesangial cells, and platelets. The V2 receptor (300538) is exclusively
expressed in the kidney, and defects in this receptor result in
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Sugimoto et al. (1994) cloned the V1b
receptor from a cDNA library of human pituitary. (The gene is also
referred to as AVPR3.) AVP modulates the release of ACTH,
beta-endorphin, and prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Release is
mediated by the V1b receptor through the mobilization of intracellular
Ca(2+) by phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. The deduced 424-amino acid
sequence of the V1b receptor had highest overall homology with the V1a,
V2, and oxytocin receptors, with homologies of 45, 39, and 45%,
respectively. Expressed in COS-1 cells, V1b had a single binding site
for AVP. It bound various agonists and antagonists of vasopressin with
affinities distinct from those of V1a and V2 receptors but consistent
with those anticipated for the V1b receptor on the basis of
pharmacologic studies.

The AVPR1B gene was also cloned by de Keyzer et al. (1994), who referred
to it as AVPR3. Rousseau-Merck et al. (1995) mapped the gene to 1q32 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Birnbaumer (2000) noted that the biologic effects of AVP are mediated by
3 receptor subtypes: the V1A and V1B receptors that activate
phospholipases via Gq/11, and the V2 receptor that activates adenylyl
cyclase by interacting with GS. Isolation of the cDNAs encoding the V1A
and V1B receptor subtypes explained the tissue variability of V1
antagonist binding, whereas identification of the cDNA and gene encoding
the V2 receptor provided the information to identify the mutations
responsible for X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (304800).
Mutations that abrogate the production and/or release of AVP from the
pituitary have diabetes insipidus as their most dramatic manifestation,
indicating that the maintenance of water homeostasis is the most
important physiologic role of this neuropeptide.

The pituitary V3 vasopressin receptor was used by de Keyzer et al.
(1996) to analyze the corticotroph phenotype of secreting bronchial
carcinoids associated with the ectopic ACTH syndrome. Ectopic ACTH
secretion occurs in highly differentiated and rather indolent tumors
such as bronchial carcinoids or, in contrast, in various types of
aggressive and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. They found
that in 6 of 8 bronchial carcinoids responsible for the ectopic ACTH
syndrome, both proopiomelanocortin (176830) and the V3 receptor gene
were expressed at the same level as they are in ACTH-secreting pituitary
adenomas; in contrast, no POMC expression and only very faint V3
receptor expression were detected in 6 of 8 nonsecreting bronchial
carcinoids.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wersinger et al. (2002) found that mice with a targeted disruption of
the V1br gene, which is expressed in brain, exhibited marked reduction
in aggression and modest impairment in social recognition. The mice
performed normally in all other behaviors examined, including sexual
behavior, suggesting that reduced aggression and social memory are not
simply the results of a global deficit in sensorimotor function or
motivation. Wersinger et al. (2002) suggested that V1br antagonists may
be useful for the treatment of aggressive behaviors.

Tanoue et al. (2004) investigated the functional role of the V1b
receptor in vivo by using gene targeting to create a mouse model lacking
the V1br gene. Under resting conditions, circulating concentrations of
ACTH and corticosterone were lower in the null mice compared with
wildtype mice. The normal increase in circulating ACTH levels in
response to exogenous administration of AVP was impaired in the null
mice, whereas corticotropin-releasing hormone-stimulated ACTH release
was not impaired. The increase in ACTH after a forced swim stress was
significantly suppressed in the null mice. The results demonstrated that
the V1b receptor plays a crucial role in regulating
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. It does this by
maintaining ACTH and corticosterone levels, not only under stress but
also under basal conditions.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MLL gene encodes a DNA-binding protein that methylates histone H3
(see 602810) lys4 (H3K4) and positively regulates expression of target
genes, including multiple HOX genes (see 142980). MLL is a frequent
target for recurrent translocations in acute leukemias that may be
characterized as acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626), acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or mixed lineage (biphenotypic) leukemia
(MLL). Leukemias with translocations involving MLL possess unique
clinical and biologic characteristics and are often associated with poor
prognosis. MLL rearrangements are found in more than 70% of infant
leukemias, whether the immunophenotype is more consistent with ALL or
AML6, but are less frequent in leukemias from older children. MLL
translocations are also found in approximately 10% of AMLs in adults, as
well as in therapy-related leukemias, most often characterized as AML,
that develop in patients previously treated with topoisomerase II
inhibitors for other malignancies. More than 50 different MLL fusion
partners have been identified. Leukemogenic MLL translocations encode
MLL fusion proteins that have lost H3K4 methyltransferase activity. A
key feature of MLL fusion proteins is their ability to efficiently
transform hematopoietic cells into leukemia stem cells (Krivtsov and
Armstrong, 2007).

CLONING

Recurring chromosomal translocations involving chromosome 11q23 have
been observed in both acute lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia
(AML; 601626), especially acute monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5) and acute
myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML-M4). Rowley et al. (1990) demonstrated
that the breakpoints in four 11q23 translocations associated with
leukemia were contained within a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone
bearing the CD3D (186790) and CD3G (186740) genes. Within this YAC,
Ziemin-van der Poel et al. (1991) identified a transcription unit
spanning the breakpoint junctions of 3 of these translocations, 4;11,
9;11, and 11;19. They described 2 other related transcripts that were
upregulated in a translocation cell line. Ziemin-van der Poel et al.
(1991) named the gene MLL for myeloid/lymphoid, or mixed lineage,
leukemia. Cimino et al. (1991) identified the same gene and called it
ALL1.

Gu et al. (1992) determined that the ALL1 gene encodes a protein of more
than 3,910 amino acids containing 3 regions with homology to sequences
within the Drosophila 'trithorax' gene, including cysteine-rich regions
that can be folded into 6 zinc finger-like domains. Tkachuk et al.
(1992) showed that the ALL1 gene, which they referred to as HRX (for
'homolog of trithorax'), codes for a 431-kD protein. Djabali et al.
(1992) also cloned an 11.5-kb transcript spanning the 11q23
translocation breakpoint.

Parry et al. (1993) showed that the sequence of a partial TRX1 cDNA
contained an open reading frame encoding 1,012 amino acids with
extensive homology to the Drosophila trithorax protein, particularly in
the zinc finger-like domains. The TRX1 gene appears to be unique in the
human genome and has been conserved during evolution.

Butler et al. (1997) analyzed the distribution and localization of HRX
proteins in cell lines and human tissues, using both polyclonal and
monoclonal antibodies. Immunocytochemical analysis showed a punctate
distribution of wildtype and chimeric HRX proteins within cell nuclei,
suggesting that HRX localizes to nuclear structures in cells with and
without 11q23 translocations. Nuclear staining was found in the majority
of tissues studied, with the strongest reactivity in cerebral cortex,
kidney, thyroid, and lymphoid tissues. Thus, Butler et al. (1997)
concluded that HRX is widely expressed in most cell types, including
hematopoietic cells, a finding that precludes an immunocytochemical
approach for diagnosis of leukemias bearing 11q23 structural
abnormalities.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gu et al. (1992) determined that the MLL gene spans approximately 100 kb
and contains at least 21 exons.

MAPPING

The MLL gene maps to chromosome 11q23 (Ziemin-van der Poel et al., 1991;
Cimino et al., 1991).

GENE FUNCTION

Milne et al. (2002) showed that MLL regulates target HOX gene expression
through direct binding to promoter sequences. They determined that the
MLL SET domain is a histone H3 (see 601128) lys4 (K4)-specific
methyltransferase whose activity is stimulated with acetylated H3
peptides. This methylase activity was found to be associated with HOX
gene activation and H3 K4 methylation at cis regulatory sequences in
vivo. A leukemogenic MLL fusion protein that activates HOX expression
had no effect on histone methylation, suggesting a distinct mechanism
for gene regulation by MLL and MLL fusion proteins.

Nakamura et al. (2002) found that ALL1 is present within a stable
multiprotein supercomplex composed of at least 29 proteins. The majority
of the complex proteins are components of transcription complexes,
including TFIID (see 604912). Other components are involved in RNA
processing or histone methylation. The authors found that the complex
remodels, acetylates, deacetylates, and methylates nucleosomes and/or
free histones, and that the H3 K4 methylation activity of the complex is
conferred by the ALL1 SET domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitations showed
that ALL1 and other complex components examined were bound at the
promoter of an active ALL1-dependent HOXA9 gene (142956). In parallel,
H3 K4 was methylated, and histones H3 and H4 were acetylated at this
promoter.

The MLL gene encodes a large nuclear protein that is required for the
maintenance of HOX gene expression. MLL is cleaved at 2 conserved sites
to generate an N-terminal 320-kD fragment (N320) and a C-terminal 180-kD
fragment (C180), which heterodimerize to stabilize the complex and
confer its subnuclear destination. Hsieh et al. (2003) purified and
cloned the protease responsible for cleaving MLL, which they entitled
taspase-1 (608270). They determined that taspase-1 initiates a class of
endopeptidases that utilize an N-terminal threonine as the active-site
nucleophile to proteolyze polypeptide substrates following aspartate.
RNA interference-mediated knockdown of taspase-1 in HeLa cells resulted
in the appearance of unprocessed MLL and the loss of proper HOX gene
expression.

Lim et al. (2009) showed that Mll1 is required for neurogenesis in the
mouse postnatal brain. Mll1-deficient subventricular zone neural stem
cells survive, proliferate, and efficiently differentiate into glial
lineages; however, neuronal differentiation is severely impaired. In
Mll1-deficient cells, early proneural Mash1 (100790) and gliogenic Olig2
(606386) expression are preserved, but Dlx2 (126255), a key downstream
regulator of subventricular zone neurogenesis, is not expressed.
Overexpression of Dlx2 can rescue neurogenesis in Mll1-deficient cells.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that Dlx2 is a direct target
of MLL in subventricular zone cells. In differentiating wildtype
subventricular zone cells, Mash1, Olig2, and Dlx2 loci have high levels
of histone-3 trimethylated at lys4 (H3K4me3), consistent with their
transcription. In contrast, in Mll1-deficient subventricular zone cells,
chromatin at Dlx2 is bivalently marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, and
the Dlx2 gene fails to properly activate. Lim et al. (2009) concluded
that their data supported a model in which Mll1 is required to resolve
key silenced bivalent loci in postnatal neural precursors to the
actively transcribed state for the induction of neurogenesis, but not
for gliogenesis.

Liu et al. (2010) assigned MLL as a novel effector in the mammalian
S-phase checkpoint network and identified checkpoint dysfunction as an
underlying mechanism of MLL leukemias. MLL is phosphorylated at ser516
by ATR (601215) in response to genotoxic stress in the S phase, which
disrupts its interaction with, and hence its degradation by, the
SCF(Skp2) E3 ligase (see 601436), leading to its accumulation.
Stabilized MLL protein accumulates on chromatin, methylates histone H3
lysine-4 at late replication origins, and inhibits the loading of CDC45
(603465) to delay DNA replication. Cells deficient in MLL showed
radioresistant DNA synthesis and chromatid-type genomic abnormalities,
indicative of S-phase checkpoint dysfunction. Reconstitution of Mll-null
mouse embryonic fibroblasts with wildtype but not S516A or delta-SET
mutant MLL rescued the S-phase checkpoint defects. Moreover, murine
myeloid progenitor cells carrying an Mll-CBP (600140) knockin allele
that mimics human t(11;16) leukemia showed a severe radioresistant DNA
synthesis phenotype. Liu et al. (2010) demonstrated that MLL fusions
function as dominant-negative mutants that abrogate the ATR-mediated
phosphorylation/stabilization of wildtype MLL on damage to DNA, and thus
compromise the S-phase checkpoint. Together, Liu et al. (2010) concluded
that their results identified MLL as a key constituent of the mammalian
DNA damage response pathway and showed that deregulation of the S-phase
checkpoint incurred by MLL translocations probably contributes to the
pathogenesis of human MLL leukemias.

- MLL Fusion Proteins

Human ML-2 leukemia cells lack a normal MLL gene and exclusively express
an MLL/AF6 (MLLT4; 159559) fusion protein. Yokoyama et al. (2005) showed
that MLL/AF6 associated with menin (MEN1; 613733) in ML-2 cells.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed both proteins present on
upstream sites of the HOXA7 (142950), HOXA9 (142956), and HOXA10
(142957) promoters. Deletions and point mutations performed in the MLL
portion of the MLL/ENL (MLLT1; 159556) fusion protein revealed a high
affinity menin-binding motif (RXRFP) near the N terminus. Interaction
between oncogenic MLL and menin was required for initiation of
MLL-mediated leukemogenesis in mouse stem/progenitor cells, and menin
was essential to maintain MLL-associated myeloid transformation. Acute
genetic ablation of menin in mice reversed aberrant Hox gene expression
mediated by MLL-menin promoter-associated complexes and specifically
abrogated differentiation arrest and oncogenic properties of
MLL-transformed leukemic blasts.

By gel filtration, mass spectrometry, and Western blot analysis of human
cell lines, Nie et al. (2003) identified unique low-abundance SWI/SWF
complexes that contained ENL, several common SWI/SNF subunits, and
either BAF250A (ARID1A; 603024) or BAF250B (ARID1B; 614556). Western
blot analysis of HB(11;19) leukemia cells, which express the oncogenic
MLL/ENL fusion protein, revealed that MLL/ENL also interacted with the
BAF250B-containing complex. MLL/ENL-containing SWI/SNF complexes
coactivated the HOXA7 promoter in a reporter gene assay.

CYTOGENETICS

- MLL Breakpoint Cluster Region

The ALL1 gene is rearranged in acute leukemias with interstitial
deletions or reciprocal translocations between chromosome 11q23 and
chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 9, 10, or 19. Gu et al. (1992) cloned translocation
fragments from leukemic cells from t(4;11) and showed clustering of the
breakpoints in areas of 7 to 8 kb on both chromosome 4 and 11.
Sequencing indicated heptamer and nonamer-like sequences, associated
with rearrangements of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes, near
the breakpoints. This suggested a direct involvement of the VDJ
recombinase in the 11q23 translocations. Gu et al. (1992) determined
that the breakpoint cluster region within ALL1 spans 8 kb and
encompasses several small exons, most of which begin in the same phase
of the open reading frame.

McCabe et al. (1992) presented evidence that the breakpoints in all the
translocations involving 11q23 in leukemia cells, e.g., t(4;11) t(6;11),
t(9;11), and t(11;19), are clustered within a 9-kb BamHI genomic region
of the MLL gene. McCabe et al. (1992) detected rearrangements of DNA in
a fragment of the MLL gene by Southern blot hybridization. Djabali et
al. (1992) concluded that most of the breakpoints in infant leukemias
with t(4;11) and t(9;11) translocations lie within a 5-kb region.

Using a human TRX1 cDNA as a probe, Parry et al. (1993) demonstrated
that the gene is interrupted in both infant and adult acute myeloid
(AML) and lymphoid (ALL) leukemia patients with 11q23 translocations.
The structure of the TRX1 gene around the breakpoints show that this
part of the human gene is interrupted by 9 introns. As a result of the
rearrangement, zinc finger domains are translocated in both ALL and AML
patients.

Strout et al. (1998) analyzed the fusion sequences in genomic DNA from 9
patients with AML. Each had a partial tandem repeat spanning exons 2 to
6 of the ALL1 gene on 11q23. The breakpoint in intron 6 occurred in the
breakpoint cluster region and the other near the 3-prime end of intron
1. In 7 cases, a distinct point of fusion could not be identified;
instead, the sequence gradually diverged from an Alu element in intron 6
to an Alu element in intron 1 through heteroduplex fusion. The results
supported the hypothesis that a recombination event between homologous
Alu sequences is responsible for the partial tandem duplication of ALL1,
probably through an intrastrand slipped-mispairing mechanism, in the
majority of AML cases with this defect. This appeared to be the first
demonstration identifying Alu element-mediated recombination as a
consistent mechanism for gene rearrangement in somatic tissue.

- MLL/AF4 Fusion Gene

Gu et al. (1992) determined that the t(4;11) chromosome translocation in
leukemia results in 2 reciprocal fusion products coding for chimeric
proteins derived from ALL1 and from a gene on chromosome 4 that they
termed AF4 (MLLT2; 159557).

Translocations involving 11q23 in leukemia result in the translocation
of zinc finger domains with fusion to other genes on chromosome 4,
chromosome 9, or chromosome 19. The gene on chromosome 19 with which it
is fused is ENL (159556). Nakamura et al. (1993) showed that the genes
with which it is fused on chromosome 4 (AF4) and chromosome 9 (AF9;
159558) show high homology of sequence to ENL. The protein products of
the AF4, AF9, and ENL proteins contained nuclear targeting sequences as
well as serine-rich and proline-rich regions.

Independently, Domer et al. (1993) characterized the MLL/AF4 fusion
product generated by the t(4;11) translocation. The sequence of the
complete open reading frame for this fusion transcript revealed that the
MLL protein is homologous to DNA methyltransferase. In the fusion gene,
the 5-prime portion is derived from the MLL gene and the 3-prime portion
from the AF4 gene.

Gale et al. (1997) demonstrated that unique or clonotypic MLL-AF4
genomic fusion sequences were detectable in neonatal blood spots from
individuals who developed ALL at ages 5 months to 2 years, thus
providing unequivocal evidence for a prenatal initiation of acute
leukemia in young patients. They stated that common subtypes due to
other translocation fusion genes can be expected to have a similar
prenatal initiation.

In an infant diagnosed at the age of 3 weeks with ALL after presenting
with hepatosplenomegaly and marked leukocytosis, Raffini et al. (2002)
found a 3-way rearrangement of the MLL, AF4, and CDK6 (603368) genes. By
reverse-panhandle PCR, they identified a breakpoint junction of CDK6
from band 7q21-q22 and MLL intron 9. Thus, the patient had an in-frame
CDK6-MLL transcript along with an in-frame MLL-AF4 transcript.

Wang et al. (2010) studied leukemia stem cells in mouse models of acute
myelogenous leukemia induced by either coexpression of the Hoxa9
(142956) and Meis1a (601739) oncogenes or by the fusion oncoprotein
MLL-AF9. The authors showed that the Wnt (see 164820)/beta-catenin
(116806) signaling pathway is required for self-renewal of leukemia stem
cells that are derived from either hematopoietic stem cells or more
differentiated granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Because the
Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is normally active in hematopoietic stem cells
but not in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, Wang et al. (2010)
concluded that reactivation of beta-catenin signaling is required for
the transformation of progenitor cells by certain oncogenes.
Beta-catenin is not absolutely required for self-renewal of adult
hematopoietic stem cells; thus, targeting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway
may represent a new therapeutic opportunity in acute myelogenous
leukemia.

- MLL/ENL Fusion Gene

In studies of a t(11;19)-carrying cell line, Tkachuk et al. (1992)
identified fusion transcripts expressed from both derivative
chromosomes. The more abundant derivative 11 transcript coded for a
chimeric protein containing the amino terminal 'AT-hook' motifs of the
HRX gene fused to the ENL gene (MLLT1; 159556) from chromosome 19. (ENL
was so named for '11-19 leukemia.') The HRX protein may have effects
mediated by DNA binding within the minor groove at AT-rich sites.
Tkachuk et al. (1992) referred to this type of leukemia as representing
the multilineage leukemias rather than mixed lineage leukemias. The cell
line carrying the t(11;19) was from a patient with T-cell precursor
acute lymphocytic leukemia (Smith et al., 1989).

Translocations involving 11q23 in leukemia result in the translocation
of zinc finger domains with fusion to other genes on chromosome 4,
chromosome 9, or chromosome 19. The gene on chromosome 19 with which it
is fused is ENL. Nakamura et al. (1993) showed that the genes with which
it is fused on chromosome 4 (AF4) and chromosome 9 (AF9; 159558) show
high homology of sequence to ENL. The protein products of the AF4, AF9,
and ENL proteins contained nuclear targeting sequences as well as
serine-rich and proline-rich regions.

- MLL/AF9 Fusion Gene

Translocations involving 11q23 in leukemia result in the translocation
of zinc finger domains with fusion to other genes on chromosome 4,
chromosome 9, or chromosome 19. The gene on chromosome 19 with which it
is fused is ENL. Nakamura et al. (1993) showed that the genes with which
it is fused on chromosome 4 (AF4) and chromosome 9 (AF9; 159558) show
high homology of sequence to ENL. The protein products of the AF4, AF9,
and ENL proteins contained nuclear targeting sequences as well as
serine-rich and proline-rich regions.

The human AF9 gene is one of the most common fusion partner genes with
MLL, resulting in the t(9;11)(p22;q23). Strissel et al. (2000)
identified several different structural elements in AF9, including a
colocalizing DNA topo II cleavage site and a DNase I hypersensitive
(DNase I HS) site. In addition, 2 scaffold-associated regions (SARs) are
located centromeric to the topo II and DNase I HS cleavage sites and
border breakpoint regions in 2 leukemic cell lines. The authors thus
demonstrated that the patient breakpoint regions of AF9 share the same
structural elements as the MLL BCR, and they proposed a DNA breakage and
repair model for nonhomologous recombination between MLL and its partner
genes, particularly AF9.

- MLL/AF6 Fusion Gene

Prasad et al. (1993) identified AF6 (MLLT4; 159559) as the fusion
partner of MLL in a common translocation, t(6;11)(q27;q23), associated
with leukemia. The t(6;11)(q27;q23) translocation results in a chimeric
MLL/AF6 protein with a calculated molecular mass of 325 kD. In the
chimeric protein, the N-terminal portion of MLL, including 3 AT hook
motifs, is fused to all of AF6 except the first 35 amino acids, leaving
the Ras-interacting domain and the DHR motif of AF6 intact. By Western
blot analysis of transfected COS cells and a human cell line with the
t(6;11)(q27;q23) translocation, Joh et al. (1997) found that the MLL/AF6
fusion protein had an apparent molecular mass of 360 kD.
Immunolocalization and cell fractionation followed by Western blot
analysis indicated that MLL/AF6 was targeted to the nucleus, whereas AF6
itself was cytoplasmic. Mutation analysis indicted that the region of
MLL containing AT hook motifs was responsible for the nuclear
localization of the chimeric protein.

- MLL/GPH Fusion Gene

Eguchi et al. (2001) found that the gephyrin gene (GPH; 603930) can
partner with MLL in leukemia associated with the translocation
t(11;14)(q23;q24). The child in whom this translocation was discovered
showed signs of acute undifferentiated leukemia 3 years after intensive
chemotherapy that included the topoisomerase II inhibitor VP16. The AT
hook motifs and a DNA methyltransferase homology domain of the MLL gene
were fused to the C-terminal half of GPH, including a presumed
tubulin-binding site and a domain homologous to the E. coli molybdenum
cofactor biosynthesis protein. Eguchi et al. (2001) suggested that
MLL-GPHN may have been generated by the chemotherapeutic agent, followed
by error-prone DNA repair via nonhomologous end-joining.

- MLL/GMPS Fusion Gene

In a patient with treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia and the
karyotype t(3;11)(q25;q23), Pegram et al. (2000) identified GMPS
(600358) to be the partner gene of MLL. The authors stated that GMPS was
the first partner gene of MLL to be identified on 3q and the first gene
of this type to be found in leukemia-associated translocations.

- MLL/FBP17 Fusion Gene

Fuchs et al. (2001) reported fusion of the gene encoding formin-binding
protein-17 (FBP17; 606191) to MLL in a child with acute myelogeneous
leukemia and a complex chromosome rearrangement,
ins(11;9)(q23;134)inv(11)(q13q23). The fused mRNA was represented by MLL
at the 5-prime end and FBP17 at the 3-prime end.

- MLL/LPP Fusion Gene

By FISH and Southern blot analyses, Daheron et al. (2001) identified a
rearrangement in the mixed lineage leukemia gene due to a novel
t(3;11)(q28;q23) translocation in a patient who developed acute myeloid
leukemia of the M5 type 3 years after treatment for a follicular
lymphoma. Through inverse PCR, they identified the LPP gene (600700) on
3q28 as the MLL fusion partner. The breakpoint occurred in intron 8 of
MLL and LPP. They found that the MLL/LPP and LPP/MLL predicted proteins
contain many of the features present in other MLL rearrangements.

- MLL/PNUTL1 Fusion Gene

Megonigal et al. (1998) examined the MLL genomic translocation
breakpoint in acute myeloid leukemia of infant twins. Southern blot
analysis showed 2 identical MLL gene rearrangements indicating
chromosomal translocation. The rearrangements were detected in the
second twin before signs of clinical disease and the intensity relative
to the normal fragment indicated that the translocation was not
constitutional. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with an MLL-specific
probe and karyotype analyses suggested that a t(11;22)(q23;q11.2)
disrupted MLL. Megonigal et al. (1998) used panhandle variant PCR to
clone the translocation breakpoint and identified a region of 22q11.2
involved in both leukemia and a constitutional disorder. By ligating a
single-stranded oligonucleotide that was homologous to known 5-prime MLL
genomic sequence to the 5-prime ends of BamHI-digested DNA through a
bridging oligonucleotide, they formed the stem-loop template for
panhandle variant PCR, which yielded products of 3.9 kb. The MLL genomic
breakpoint was in intron 7. The sequence of the partner DNA from 22q11.2
was identical to the human CDCrel (cell division cycle-related) gene
(PNUTL1; 602724) that maps to chromosome 22. Both MLL and PNUTL1
contained homologous CT, TTTGTG, and GAA sequences within a few
basepairs of their respective breakpoints, which may have been important
in uniting these 2 genes by translocation. RT-PCR amplified an in-frame
fusion of MLL exon 7 to PNUTL1 exon 3, indicating that a chimeric mRNA
had been transcribed.

- MLL/CDK6 Fusion Gene

In an infant diagnosed at the age of 3 weeks with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL; 613065) after presenting with hepatosplenomegaly and
marked leukocytosis, Raffini et al. (2002) found a 3-way rearrangement
of the MLL, AF4, and CDK6 (603368) genes. By reverse-panhandle PCR, they
identified a breakpoint junction of CDK6 from band 7q21-q22 and MLL
intron 9. Thus, the patient had an in-frame CDK6-MLL transcript along
with an in-frame MLL-AF4 transcript.

- MLL/LASP1 Fusion Gene

Strehl et al. (2003) identified a new MLL fusion partner on chromosome
17q in the case of an infant with AML-M4 and a t(11;17)(q23;q21)
translocation. FISH and RT-PCR analyses indicated a rearrangement of the
MLL gene, but no fusion with previously identified MLL fusion partners
at 17q, such as AF17 (600328) or MSF (604061). RACE revealed an in-frame
fusion of MLL to LASP1 (602920), a gene that is amplified and
overexpressed in breast cancer. The authors stated that retroviral
transduction of myeloid progenitors demonstrated that MLL/LASP1 was the
fourth known fusion of MLL with a cytoplasmic protein that has no in
vitro transformation capability, the others being GRAF (605370), ABI1
(603050), and FBP17.

- MLL/LAF4 Fusion Gene

Von Bergh et al. (2002) identified an MLL/LAF4 (601464) fusion gene in
an infant with ALL and a t(2;11)(p15;p14) translocation. Bruch et al.
(2003) also reported an infant with ALL and an MLL/LAF4 fusion caused by
an ins(11;2)(q23;q11.2q11.2) insertion.

- MLL/LARG Fusion Gene

In a patient with primary acute myeloid leukemia and a complex
karyotype, Kourlas et al. (2000) found that the 5-prime end of MLL at
exon 6 was fused in-frame with the 3-prime end of almost the entire open
reading frame of the LARG gene (604763), which lies on 11q23.
Transcriptional orientation of both genes at 11q23 was found to be from
centromere to telomere, consistent with other data that suggested that
the MLL/LARG fusion resulted from an interstitial deletion rather than a
balanced translocation.

- MLL/CBL Fusion Gene

Fu et al. (2003) found that the CBL gene (165360), which lies telomeric
to MLL on 11q23, was fused to MLL in an adult patient with de novo acute
myeloid leukemia (FAB M1). MLL exon 6 was fused in-frame with CBL exon
8. The genomic junction region involved the fusion of the 3-prime
portion of an Alu element in intron 6 of MLL with the 5-prime portion of
an Alu element in intron 7 of CBL. The absence of extensive sequence
similarity at both breakpoints of MLL and CBL indicated that the
recombination was not generated through homologous recombination. The
transcriptional orientation of both genes is from centromere to
telomere. The results of Southern blot analysis in conjunction with FISH
suggested that the MLL/CBL fusion was the result of an interstitial
deletion. CBL was the second MLL fusion partner identified on 11q23, the
first being the LARG gene. Fu et al. (2003) stated that at least 34
partner genes for MLL had been identified.

- MLL/AF10 Fusion Gene

Tanabe et al. (1996) identified an invins(10;11)(p12;q23q12) and other
complex chromosomal rearrangements in a 2-year old boy with acute
monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5). Cloning of the proximal 10p breakpoint
showed that the MLL gene at chromosome 11q23 was fused to the 3-prime
portion of AF10 (MLLT10; 602409) at chromosome 10p12. Cloning of the
telomeric 10p junction revealed that the 5-prime portion of AF10 was
fused with the HEAB gene (608757). The 5-prime AF10/HEAB fusion
transcript was out of frame, while the MLL/3-prime AF10 fusion was in
frame.

- MLL/AF15q14 Fusion Gene

Hayette et al. (2000) described a 48-year-old man with AML-M4 who was
cytogenetically characterized as 46,XY,-3,t(11;15)(q23;q1 4),+mar. The
bone marrow was hypercellular, with 80% blast cells. The patient was
treated by intensive chemotherapy and died 4 month after diagnosis. The
translocation resulted in a in-frame fusion between exon 8 of the MLL
gene and exon 10 of the AF15q14 gene (609173). The fusion transcript was
predicted to encode a 1,503-amino acid protein composed of 1,418
N-terminal amino acids of MLL and 85 C-terminal amino acids of AF15q14,
including the bipartite nuclear localization signal.

Kuefer et al. (2003) identified a similar t(11;15)(q23;q14) in a
3-year-old boy with de novo T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this
translocation, exon 9 of the MLL gene was fused in-frame to exon 12 of
the AF15q14 gene. The deduced 1,886-amino acid fusion protein, which
contains the N terminus of MLL up to lys1362 fused to the entire C
terminus of AF15q14 starting from residue ile1819, has a calculated
molecular mass of 208 kD. It differs from the fusion protein described
by Hayette et al. (2000) in that it has a coiled-coil domain but no
nuclear localization signal.

- MLL/CIP29 Fusion Gene

In an infant with AML-M4, Hashii et al. (2004) identified a
translocation, t(11;12)(q23;q13), in which the coding region of the
CIP29 gene (610049) was fused in-frame to exon 9 of the MLL gene. The
fusion protein had the N-terminal AT hooks and central DNA
methyltransferase homology region of MLL fused to nearly all of the
CIP29 protein, including the N-terminal SAP domain and 2 C-terminal
nuclear localization signals. RT-PCR confirmed expression of the fusion
transcript in patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

- MLL/SEPT6 Fusion Gene

Kadkol et al. (2006) described an infant with AML who had a
rearrangement between chromosomes 11q23 and Xq24. FISH analysis showed a
break in MLL, and RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression of an MLL/SEPT6
(300683) fusion transcript.

- MLL/MAML2 Fusion Gene

Nemoto et al. (2007) isolated MLL/MAML2 (607537) fusion transcripts from
secondary AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cells with
inv(11)(q21q23). RT-PCR revealed that exon 7 of MLL was fused to exon 2
of MAML2 in the AML and MDS cells. The inv(11)(q21q23) resulted in a
chimeric RNA encoding a putative fusion protein containing 1,408 amino
acids from the N-terminal part of MLL and 952 amino acids from the
C-terminal part of MAML2. The N-terminal part of MAML2, a basic domain
that includes a binding site for the NOTCH (see NOTCH1; 190198)
intracellular domain, was deleted in MLL/MAML2. The MLL/MAML2 fusion
protein in secondary AML and MDS and the MECT1/MAML2 fusion protein in
mucoepithelioid carcinoma, benign Warthin tumor, and clear cell
hidradenoma contained the same C-terminal part of MAML2. Reporter gene
assays revealed that MLL/MAML2 suppressed HES1 (139605) promoter
activation by the NOTCH1 intracellular domain.

- MLL/GRAF Fusion Gene

Borkhardt et al. (2000) found that the GRAF gene (605370) was fused with
MLL in a unique t(5;11)(q31;q23) that occurred in an infant with
juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.

- MLL/ABI1 Fusion Gene

Taki et al. (1998) analyzed a patient with AML and t(10;11)(p11.2;q23)
and identified, as a fusion partner with MLL, the gene ABI1 (603050) on
10p11.2. The ABI1 gene bore no homology with partner genes of MLL
previously described, but the ABI1 protein exhibited sequence similarity
to protein of homeotic genes, contained several polyproline stretches,
and included a Src homology-3 (SH3) domain at the C terminus. The
MLL-ABI1 fusion transcript in this patient was formed by an
alternatively spliced ABI1. In-frame MLL-ABI1 fusion transcripts
combined the MLL AT-hook motifs and DNA methyltransferase homology
region with the homeodomain homologous region, polyproline stretches,
and SH3 domain of the alternatively spliced transcript of ABI1.

- MLL/KIAA1524 Fusion Gene

Coenen et al. (2011) identified the karyotype 46,XX,t(3;11)(q12-13;q23)
in bone marrow of a 4-month-old Caucasian girl who presented with the M5
subtype of AML and central nervous system involvement. The patient died
9 weeks after diagnosis. The translocation resulted in fusion of intron
10 of the MLL gene on chromosome 11 to intron 16 of the KIAA1524 gene
(610643) on chromosome 3. The 2 genes are transcribed in opposite
orientations, suggesting that the translocation also required a
microinversion. RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression of the fusion
transcript, which was predicted to encode a 1,673-amino acid protein
containing the N-terminal AT-hook domain, subnuclear localization sites,
and methyltransferase domain of MLL fused to the C-terminal coiled-coil
domain of KIAA1524.

- MLL Duplication

In a study of patients with acute leukemia but no microscopically
visible change at 11q23, Schichman et al. (1994) found molecular
evidence of partial duplication of the ALL1 gene. The direct tandem
duplication involved a region spanning exons 2 to 6, and a partially
duplicated protein gene product was demonstrated. Thus, the ALL1 gene is
leukemogenic when it fuses with itself as well as when it fuses with one
of the genes on other chromosomes.

In addition to the translocations involving fusion of the ALL1 gene with
genes on other chromosomes producing acute lymphoblastic and myelogenous
leukemia, the ALL1 gene undergoes self-fusion in acute myeloid leukemias
with normal karyotype or trisomy 11. In addition, Baffa et al. (1995)
reported rearrangement of the ALL1 gene in a gastric carcinoma cell
line. A complex, 3-way translocation involving chromosomes 1 and 11 and
resulting in partial duplication of the ALL1 gene was found. Sequencing
of RT-PCR products and Northern blot analysis show that only the
partially duplicated ALL1 gene was transcribed, producing an mRNA with
exon 8 fused to exon 2. Thus, ALL1 gene rearrangement may play a role in
the pathogenesis of some solid malignancies. The absence of the normal
transcript in this cell line, in association with loss of heterozygosity
on 11q23 seen in solid tumors, suggests that ALL1 is involved in
tumorigenesis by a loss-of-function mechanism.

Approximately 90% of adult patients with de novo AML and trisomy 11
(+11) as a sole abnormality and 11% of adult patients with de novo AML
and normal cytogenetics carry a molecular rearrangement of the ALL1
gene. The rearranged ALL1 gene results from the direct tandem
duplication of a portion of ALL1 itself. Caligiuri et al. (1997) showed
that in cytogenetically normal cases of AML and cases with +11 as the
sole cytogenetic abnormality, only 1 chromosome contains the mutated
ALL1 allele. Thus, a single mutated ALL1 allele with the partial tandem
duplication is sufficient for ALL1-associated leukemogenesis,
irrespective of the number of normal genes present. The frequently
occurring specific association of +11 and ALL1 gene mutation in the
leukemic clone remained unexplained.

- Detection of MLL Rearrangements

Thirman et al. (1993) demonstrated that MLL gene rearrangements can be
detected with a single probe and a single restriction-enzyme digest. The
ability to detect an MLL gene rearrangement rapidly and reliably,
especially in patients with limited material for cytogenetic analysis,
should make it possible to identify patients who have a poor prognosis
and therefore require aggressive chemotherapy or marrow transplantation.

PHENOTYPE

The MLL gene spans the breakpoint in translocations involving 11q23,
which are responsible for approximately 70% of AML and ALL in infants
and are also observed in treatment-related leukemias, especially in
patients previously treated with drugs inhibiting topoisomerase II
(Gibbons et al., 1990; Thirman et al., 1993).

In 15 of 26 AML cases in infants, Sorensen et al. (1994) found
rearrangement of the MLL gene at the molecular level. These
rearrangements were clustered within an 11-kb region containing 9 exons
of the gene. In 14 of the 15 cases with rearrangements, the leukemia was
associated with myelomonocytic or monocytic phenotypes (M4 or M5 FAB
subtypes, respectively), both of which are associated with a poor
prognosis in childhood AML. In contrast, only 1 of 11 nonrearranged
cases had an M4 or M5 phenotype. Rearrangement also correlated
significantly with hyperleukocytosis, another clinical parameter
associated with poor outcome.

Kobayashi et al. (1993) described a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
in a 44-year-old woman after adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer;
they demonstrated rearrangement of the HRX gene.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemias carrying a chromosomal translocation
involving the MLL gene have a particularly poor prognosis. Armstrong et
al. (2002) showed that they have a characteristic, highly distinct gene
expression profile that is consistent with an early hematopoietic
progenitor expressing select multilineage markers and individual HOX
genes. Clustering algorithms showed that lymphoblastic leukemias with
MLL translocations can clearly be separated from conventional acute
lymphoblastic and acute myelogenous leukemias. Armstrong et al. (2002)
proposed that they constitute a distinct disease, denoted as MLL, and
showed that the differences in gene expression are robust enough to
classify leukemias correctly as MLL versus acute lymphoblastic leukemia
or acute myelogenous leukemia. Establishing that MLL is a unique entity
is critical, as it mandates the examination of selectively expressed
genes for urgently needed molecular targets.

PATHOGENESIS

Chromosomal translocations involving the MLL gene occur in about 80% of
infant leukemias. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that maternal
exposure to various substances such as pesticides, marijuana, or an
excess of flavonoids (naturally occurring inhibitors of topoisomerase
II) might be associated with acute leukemia in infants (Ross et al.,
1994). In search of possible agents inducing infant leukemia, Strick et
al. (2000) investigated bioflavonoids, natural substances in food as
well as in dietary supplements, that cause site-specific DNA cleavage in
the MLL breakpoint cluster region (BCR) in vivo. The MLL BCR DNA
cleavage was shown in primary progenitor hematopoietic cells from
healthy newborns and adults as well as in cell lines; it colocalized
with the MLL BCR cleavage site induced by chemotherapeutic agents, such
as etoposide (VP16) and doxorubicin (Dox). Both in vivo and additional
in vitro experiments demonstrated topoisomerase II (TOP2A; 126430) as
the target of bioflavonoids similar to the 2 chemotherapeutic agents.
Based on 20 bioflavonoids tested, Strick et al. (2000) identified a
common structure essential for topoisomerase II cleavage. The authors'
observations supported a 2-stage model of cellular processing of
topoisomerase II inhibitors: the first and reversible stage of this
cleavage resulted in DNA repair, but also rarely in chromosome
translocations; whereas the second, nonreversible stage led to cell
death because of an accumulation of DNA damage. These results suggested
that maternal ingestion of bioflavonoids may induce MLL breaks and
potentially translocations in utero leading to infant and early
childhood leukemia. Strick et al. (2000) concluded that although
bioflavonoids may be beneficial in certain circumstances, a potential
counterbalancing disadvantage is their possible role in causing
chromosome translocations leading to leukemia in all age groups,
analogous to the translocation forms of AML and ALL after cancer
chemotherapy. Ross (2000) commented on the observations of Strick et al.
(2000) in the context of clinical and epidemiologic findings on
childhood leukemia.

Wang et al. (2008) reported pharmacologic, physiologic, and genetic
studies that demonstrated an oncogenic requirement for glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (GSK3; see 606784) in the maintenance of a specific subtype of
poor prognosis human leukemia, genetically defined by mutations of the
MLL protooncogene. In contrast to its previously characterized roles in
suppression of neoplasia-associated signaling pathways, GSK3
paradoxically supports MLL leukemia cell proliferation and
transformation by a mechanism that ultimately involves destabilization
of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) (600778). Inhibition
of GSK3 in a preclinical murine model of MLL leukemia provided promising
evidence of efficacy and earmarked GSK3 as a candidate cancer drug
target.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Huang et al. (2012) reported the crystal structures of human menin
(613733) in its free form and in complexes with MLL1 or with JUND
(165162), or with an MLL1-LEDGF (603620) heterodimer. These structures
showed that menin contains a deep pocket that binds short peptides of
MLL1 or JUND in the same manner, but that it can have opposite effects
on transcription. The menin-JUND interaction blocks JUN N-terminal
kinase-mediated JUND phosphorylation and suppresses JUND-induced
transcription. In contrast, menin promotes gene transcription by binding
the transcription activator MLL1 through the peptide pocket while still
interacting with the chromatin-anchoring protein LEDGF at a distinct
surface formed by both menin and MLL1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yu et al. (1995) reported that Mll deletion in mice was embryonic
lethal. Mll +/- mice had retarded growth, hemopoietic abnormalities, and
bidirectional homeotic transformation of the axial skeleton, as well as
sternal malformations.

Yamashita et al. (2006) examined the role of MLL in the immune system
using Mll +/- mice. Mll +/- Cd4-positive T cells differentiated normally
into antigen-specific effector Th1 and Th2 cells in vitro, but the
ability of memory Th2 cells to produce Th2 cytokines was dramatically
decreased. Histone methylation and acetylation at Th2 cytokine gene loci
was not maintained in Mll +/- memory Th2 cells. Levels of Gata3 (131320)
mRNA were normal in Mll +/- effector Th2 cells, but they were
substantially decreased in Mll +/- memory Th2 cells; mRNA levels of
other transcription factors were not affected in Mll +/- memory Th2
cells. Histone modifications of Gata3 were also aberrant in Th2 cell
lines in which Mll expression had been knocked down by small interfering
RNA. Ovalbumin-induced allergic eosinophilic inflammation was reduced in
Mll +/- Th2 cell-transferred mice. Yamashita et al. (2006) concluded
that MLL plays a crucial role in control of memory Th2 cell responses by
maintaining expression of GATA3 and production of Th2 cytokines.

Barabe et al. (2007) demonstrated that upon transplantation into
immunodeficient mice, primitive human hematopoietic cells expressing a
mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion gene generated myeloid or lymphoid
acute leukemias, with features that recapitulated human diseases.
Analysis of serially transplanted mice revealed that the disease is
sustained by leukemia-initiating cells that have evolved over time from
a primitive cell type with a germline immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH)
gene configuration to a cell type containing rearranged IgH genes. The
leukemia-initiating cells retained both myeloid and lymphoid lineage
potential and remained responsive to microenvironmental cues. Barabe et
al. (2007) concluded that the properties of these cells provide a
biologic basis for several clinical hallmarks of MLL leukemias.

McMahon et al. (2007) found that fetal liver from Mll-knockout mouse
embryos showed defects in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor pool,
including reductions in long-term and short-term hematopoietic stem cell
numbers and a decrease in the quiescent hematopoietic stem cell
fraction. Adult mice with conditional Mll knockout had no apparent
abnormalities in mature hematopoietic cells in bone marrow, spleen, and
thymus. However, conditional Mll-knockout bone marrow cells produced
reduced numbers of colony-forming units and showed reduced ability to
compete in hematopoietic reconstitution assays. McMahon et al. (2007)
concluded that MLL has a critical role in regulating stem cell
self-renewal.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Jones et al. (2012) performed whole-exome sequencing in 4 patients with
hypertrichosis cubiti, short stature, a distinctive facial appearance,
and intellectual disability (Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome; 605130), and
identified 3 different heterozygous de novo truncating mutations, all
within exon 27 of the MLL gene (159555.0001-159555.0003) in 3 of the 4
patients. Analysis of MLL in 2 additional patients with a similar
phenotype revealed heterozygosity for 2 more de novo truncating
mutations (159555.0004 and 159555.0005). The variants were confirmed by
Sanger sequencing, and none were found in dbSNP, the 1000 Genomes
Project, 600 unrelated control exome profiles, or DNA from the
unaffected parents.

611667	TITLE *611667 SPERMATOGENESIS-ASSOCIATED SERINE-RICH PROTEIN 2; SPATS2
;;SPATA10;;
SERINE-RICH SPERMATOCYTES AND ROUND SPERMATID PROTEIN, 59-KD; P59SCR;;
SCR59
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By immunoscreening of a mouse testis cDNA library using polyclonal
antibody against Tp73l (TP63; 603273), followed by database analysis,
Senoo et al. (2002) isolated Spats2, which they called p59Scr. The
545-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 59 kD. Spats2
has a basic amino acid-rich region, is rich in serine residues, and
contains 4 predicted N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected strong expression in adult testis, moderate
expression in brain and thymus, and weak expression in ovary, kidney,
lung, heart, stomach, skeletal muscle. In situ hybridization of adult
mouse testis tissue demonstrated Spats2 expression that varied with the
seminiferous cycle during spermatogenesis, with cytoplasmic expression
in spermatocytes, round spermatids, and elongated spermatids. No
expression was detected in spermatogonia. In developing mouse testis,
Spats2 was detected at 1 week, increased rapidly to reach a maximum
level at 6 weeks, which coincides with testicular maturation, and
remained constant at a high level throughout adulthood.

GENE FUNCTION

Senoo et al. (2002) showed that mouse Spats2 mRNA levels in surgically
removed mouse testis decreased to 60% of the levels in scrotal testis at
8 days after surgery. Spats2 mRNA levels in surgically removed testis
subjected to high temperature stress decreased more than compared to
testis-specific kinase (MAK; 154235) and beta-actin (ACTB; 102630)
levels. Senoo et al. (2002) suggested that SPATS2 may play a role in
testicular germ cell development.

186852	TITLE *186852 PROTEASOME 26S SUBUNIT, ATPase, 3; PSMC3
;;TAT-BINDING PROTEIN 1; TBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) protein Tat is a potent
activator of virus gene expression and replication. Nelbock et al.
(1990) used biotinylated Tat as a probe to screen a lambda-gt11 fusion
protein library, thereby cloning a cDNA encoding a protein that
interacts with Tat. Expression of this protein, designated Tat-binding
protein-1, was observed in a variety of cell lines, with expression
being highest in human cells. TBP1 was localized predominantly in the
nucleus, which is consistent with the nuclear localization of Tat. In
cotransfection experiments, expression of TBP1 was able to suppress
Tat-mediated transactivation specifically. Nelbock et al. (1990)
recommended their strategy for direct identification and cloning of
genes encoding proteins that associate with other proteins to modulate
their activity in a positive or negative fashion. Ohana et al. (1993)
suggested that TBP1 is involved in Tat-mediated transcriptional
activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by a 26S ATP-dependent protease. The
protease is composed of a 20S catalytic proteasome and 2 PA700
regulatory modules (see PSMC1; 602706). DeMartino et al. (1996)
identified a protein complex that enhances PA700 activation of the
proteasome. They found that 2 proteins, p42 (PSMC6; 602708) and p50
(PSMC3), are components of both this complex and PA700. By protein
sequence analysis, DeMartino et al. (1996) determined that p50 and TBP1
are identical.

Hoyle et al. (1997) stated that the PSMC3 gene encodes a protein with 1
AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) domain (see
PSMC5; 601681) toward the C terminus.

Corn et al. (2003) established that pVHL (608537), the protein that is
mutant in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (193300), binds to TBP1. TBP1
associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and
hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1A (603348) in vivo.
Overexpression of TBP1 promotes degradation of HIF1A in a pVHL-dependent
manner that requires the ATPase domain of TBP1. Several distinct
mutations in exon 2 of the VHL gene disrupt binding of pVHL to TBP1. A
pVHL mutant containing an exon 2 missense substitution
coimmunoprecipitated with HIF1A, but not TBP1, and did not promote
degradation of HIF1A. Thus, the ability of pVHL to degrade HIF1A depends
in part on its interaction with TBP1 and suggests a new mechanism for
HIF1A stabilization in some pVHL-deficient tumors.

MAPPING

By PCR amplification of a partial PSMC3 sequence, Hoyle et al. (1997)
demonstrated that the PSMC3 gene is located on chromosome 11. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the assignment was
regionalized to 11p13-p12. Tanahashi et al. (1998) mapped the PSMC3 gene
to 11p11.2 by FISH. By interspecific backcross analysis, Sakao et al.
(2000) mapped the mouse Psmc3 gene to chromosome 2.

By screening a testis library with a partial ADAM20 (603712) cDNA, Hooft
van Huijsduijnen (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding ADAM21. Northern blot
analysis detected ADAM20 and ADAM21 expression as approximately 2.8-kb
mRNAS, with ADAM21 being slightly shorter, only in testis. Like ADAM20,
the predicted 542-amino acid ADAM21 protein contains putative
cell-fusion peptides required for sperm-egg fusion. Overall, the 2
proteins are 50% identical and share sequence similarity with ADAM9
(602713) and the fertilins. In mammals, ADAM1 and ADAM2 (601533), also
known as fertilin-alpha and -beta, respectively, are expressed as
heterodimers on the posterior head of spermatocytes and play a role in
oocyte adhesion and fusion. The human ADAM1 homolog, however, is
nonfunctional.

GENE FUNCTION

Hooft van Huijsduijnen (1998) noted that the exclusive expression of
ADAM20 and ADAM21 in human testis and their sequence similarity with the
fertilins suggest that they too are expressed on sperm cells and are
involved in sperm maturation and/or fertilization. The authors proposed
that ADAM20 and/or ADAM21 is the functional equivalent of sperm
fertilin-alpha (ADAM1), since that gene is nonfunctional in human.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Hooft van Huijsduijnen (1998)
mapped both the ADAM20 and the ADAM21 genes to 14q24.1, suggesting that
they arose by gene duplication.

602344	TITLE *602344 PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR ACETYLHYDROLASE 2; PAFAH2
DESCRIPTION Hattori et al. (1996) reported the cloning of a novel isoform of
platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase (AH), termed PAFAH2 by
the authors, from human tissue. PAFAH2 encodes a 392-amino acid
polypeptide with a predicted mass of approximately 43 kD. Other PAF
acetylhydrolases include the isoform found in plasma (PAFAH; 601690) and
isoform Ib (PAFAH1B1; 601545), which is found in brain and is associated
with lissencephaly (607432). Hattori et al. (1996) found that PAFAH2
shares approximately 43% identity with plasma PAFAH, but has virtually
no similarity to brain PAFAH1B1. Unlike PAFAH, PAFAH2 contains no
secretory signal sequence, confirming its intracellular localization.
Northern blotting of bovine tissue revealed that PAFAH2 is expressed at
highest level in liver and at lower levels in a variety of other
tissues.

602074	TITLE *602074 DEATH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; DAP3
;;MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S29; MRPS29
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kissil et al. (1995) cloned DAP3. DAP3 is transcribed into a 1.7-kb mRNA
and encodes a 46-kD protein carrying a potential nucleotide-binding
motif.

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human DAP3, which they called MRPS29. The deduced 397-amino
acid MRPS29 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 45.6 kD. Removal
of a predicted 16-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization
signal results in a mature 43.6-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS29 orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast, but not in
E. coli. Mouse and human MRPS29 share 81.8% amino acid identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Kissil et al. (1995) found that DAP3 was involved in mediating
interferon-gamma (147570)-induced cell death. Several lines of evidence
suggested that suppression of cell death is a critical step in the
multistage process of tumorigenesis. Kissil et al. (1995) concluded that
DAP3, being a positive mediator of cell death, may be a tumor suppressor
gene subject to loss or inactivation in tumors.

MAPPING

Kissil and Kimchi (1997) mapped the DAP3 gene to chromosome 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Verification of the assignment was
achieved by identifying the gene in a YAC contig encompassing chromosome
1q21.1-q21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hirota et al. (2004) found a strong association between bronchial asthma
(600807) in adults and SNPs in the DAP3 gene (p = 0.0051; OR = 1.87; 95%
CI = 1.20-2.92), but no association with childhood asthma. The tendency
was more prominent in patients with high serum total immunoglobulin E
(IgE; 147180). DAP3 was found to be expressed in normal bronchial
epithelial cells, and that expression was induced by IFNG.

611348	TITLE *611348 INTEGRATOR COMPLEX SUBUNIT 4; INTS4
;;INT4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

INTS4 is a subunit of the Integrator complex, which associates with the
C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II large subunit (POLR2A; 180660)
and mediates 3-prime end processing of small nuclear RNAs U1 (RNU1;
180680) and U2 (RNU2; 180690) (Baillat et al., 2005).

GENE FUNCTION

By SDS-PAGE of proteins that copurified with INTS11 (CPSF3L; 611354) in
HEK293 cells, Baillat et al. (2005) identified INTS4 as a subunit of the
Integrator complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the INTS4
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH12075).

609004	TITLE *609004 B-CELL CLL/LYMPHOMA 9-LIKE; BCL9L
;;BCL9-2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to BCL9 (602597), Katoh and
Katoh (2003) identified BCL9L. The deduced 1,499-amino acid protein
contains 6 regions of homology with other BCL proteins. It has a nuclear
localization signal, but no signal peptide or transmembrane domain.
Katoh and Katoh (2003) also identified the mouse Bcl9l gene. The deduced
mouse protein shares 94% identity with human BCL9L. In silico analysis
of human mRNAs indicated that BCL9L is expressed in fetal brain, adult
lung, amygdala, eye, and prostate, as well as in several types of
tumors.

GENE FUNCTION

Brembeck et al. (2004) found that BCL9-2 induced epithelial mesenchymal
transitions in a nontransformed canine kidney cell line and increased
beta-catenin (116806)-dependent transcription. RNA interference of
BCL9-2 in carcinoma cells induced an epithelial phenotype and
translocated beta-catenin from the nucleus to the cell membrane. The
switch between the adhesive and transcriptional functions of
beta-catenin was modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin,
which favored BCL9-2 binding and precluded interaction with
alpha-catenin (see 116805). During zebrafish embryogenesis, Bcl9-2 acted
in the Wnt8 (see 606360) signaling pathway and regulated mesoderm
patterning.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2003) determined that the BCL9L gene contains 8 exons
and spans 15 kb. The mouse Bcl9l gene contains 8 exons and has the same
exon-intron structure.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2003) mapped the BCL9L
gene to chromosome 11q23.3.

;;LOSS OF HETEROZYGOSITY, CHROMOSOME 11, REGION 2, GENE A; LOH11CR2A;;
BREAST CANCER SUPPRESSOR CANDIDATE 1; BCSC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chromosomal deletions in chromosomal segment 11q23 are associated with
various human tumors. In lung and breast carcinomas, 2 common regions of
loss of heterozygosity have been identified at 11q23, suggesting that
the same tumor susceptibility genes are altered in these malignancies.
Monaco et al. (1997) stated that the more distal of these 2 regions,
region 2, spans less than 1.7 Mb. They identified a cDNA from region 2
and designated it LOH11CR2A. The cDNA encodes a predicted 438-amino acid
protein. Northern blot analysis revealed that LOH11CR2A is expressed
ubiquitously as a 3.3-kb mRNA.

Martin et al. (2003) found that, unlike the human BCSC1 gene, mouse
Bcsc1 is expressed as a single mRNA transcript of approximately 4 kb and
encodes a 793-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 87
kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Monaco et al. (1997) reported that the LOH11CR2A coding region is
composed of 10 exons and spans 30 to 40 kb. There are at least 2
additional exons encoding the 5-prime untranslated region.

Contrary to the original characterization of the LOH11CR2A gene (Monaco
et al., 1997), Martin et al. (2003) found that the gene, which they
called BCSC1, contains 20 exons instead of 10 and possesses a larger
open reading frame. The mouse gene was found to span a genomic region of
25 kb and to comprise 20 exons also.

MAPPING

Monaco et al. (1997) identified the LOH11CR2A gene within a region of
chromosome 11q23 associated with various human tumors.

GENE FUNCTION

Based on a mutation analysis of multiple human carcinomas and tumors,
Monaco et al. (1997) concluded that LOH11CR2A is unlikely to be involved
in the tumorigenic process.

By constructing a physical map of the LOH11CR2 minimal region of loss on
11q23-q24 associated with lung and breast carcinomas, Martin et al.
(2003) were able to clone a hereditary translocation, t(11;12)(q23;q24),
from a patient with early-onset breast cancer and family history of
cancer. The breakpoint was found within 6 kb of the BCSC1 candidate
tumor suppressor gene located in the LOH11CR2 region, whereas additional
LOH analysis in breast and ovarian tumors, including that of the patient
with the t(11;12)(q23;q24) translocation, implicated the BCSC1 locus as
the primary target of deletion. Northern analysis of the BCSC1 mRNA
revealed a lack of expression in 33 of 41 (80%) tumor cell lines, and
its ectopic expression led to the suppression of colony formation in
vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. These data suggested that BCSC1 may
exert a tumor suppressor activity and is a likely target of the LOH
observed on 11q23-q24 in cancer. Martin et al. (2003) used tumor
biopsies available from breast and ovarian cancer patients used in the
LOH analysis to screen for mutations in the BCSC1 coding region by PCR
and direct sequencing. Several previously reported polymorphisms were
found, although no tumor-specific, somatic mutations were observed.
Other results indicated that the mechanism for BCSC1 gene inactivation
in tumor cells is the loss of gene expression of one allele and deletion
of the other.

TET ONCOGENE 1;;
CXXC FINGER PROTEIN 6; CXXC6;;
LEUKEMIA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN WITH A CXXC DOMAIN; LCX;;
KIAA1676
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methylation of DNA on cytosines is an important mechanism for silencing
gene expression, and cytosine demethylation is required for gene
activation. TET1 is the founding member of a family of methylcytosine
dioxygenases that perform several steps required for cytosine
demethylation and gene activation (Ito et al., 2011; He et al., 2011).

CLONING

To identify the fusion partner of MLL in the translocation
t(10;11)(q22;q23), Ono et al. (2002) analyzed leukemic cells from an
individual with AML-M2 associated with t(10;11)(q22;q23), and identified
TET1, which they called LCX (leukemia-associated protein with a CXXC
domain) as a novel fusion partner of the MLL gene. Ono et al. (2002)
found that the LCX gene encodes a 2,136-amino acid protein with a
zinc-binding CXXC domain (which MLL also contains) within a
methyltransferase domain, 3 nuclear localizations signals, and an
alpha-helical coiled-coil region. Ono et al. (2002) found 3 RNA
transcripts of LCX, each with a distinctive pattern of tissue
expression. LCX was expressed in 8 of 22 leukemic cell lines, but not in
EBV-induced normal B-cell lines. The MLL-LCX fusion protein lacked a
CXXC domain of LCX, but retained an alpha-helical coiled-coil region at
the C terminus, similar to MLL-AF6 (see 159559), MLL-AF1P (see 600051),
and other fusion proteins involved in the pathogenesis of
11q23-associated leukemia.

GENE FUNCTION

In a computational search for enzymes that could modify 5-methylcytosine
(5mC), Tahiliani et al. (2009) identified TET proteins as mammalian
homologs of the trypanosome proteins JBP1 and JBP2, which have been
proposed to oxidize the 5-methyl group of thymine. They showed that
TET1, a fusion partner of the MLL gene in acute myeloid leukemia, is a
2-oxoglutarate (2OG)- and Fe(II)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes
conversion of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) in cultured cells and
in vitro. hmC is present in the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells,
and hmC levels decrease upon RNA interference-mediated depletion of
TET1. Thus, Tahiliani et al. (2009) concluded that TET proteins have
potential roles in epigenetic regulation through modification of 5mC to
hmC.

Ito et al. (2010) extended the study of Tahiliani et al. (2009) by
demonstrating that all 3 mouse TET proteins, Tet1, Tet2 (612839), and
Tet3 (613555), can catalyze the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC. Tet1 has an
important role in mouse embryonic stem cell maintenance through
maintaining the expression of Nanog (607937) in embryonic stem cells.
Downregulation of Nanog via Tet1 knockdown correlated with methylation
of the Nanog promoter, supporting a role for Tet1 in regulating DNA
methylation status. Furthermore, knockdown of Tet1 in preimplantation
embryos resulted in a bias towards trophectoderm differentiation. Thus,
Ito et al. (2010) concluded that their studies not only uncovered the
enzymatic activity of the Tet proteins, but also demonstrated a role for
Tet1 in embryonic stem cell maintenance and inner cell mass cell
specification.

Williams et al. (2011) showed that TET1 binds throughout the genome of
embryonic stem cells, with the majority of binding sites located at
transcription start sites of CpG-rich promoters and within genes. The
hmC modification is found in gene bodies and in contrast to mC is also
enriched at CpG-rich transcription start sites. Williams et al. (2011)
provided further evidence that TET1 has a role in transcriptional
repression. TET1 binds a significant proportion of Polycomb group target
genes. Furthermore, TET1 associates and colocalizes with the SIN3A
(607776) corepressor complex. Williams et al. (2011) proposed that TET1
fine tunes transcription, opposes aberrant DNA methylation at CpG-rich
sequences, and thereby contributes to the regulation of DNA methylation
fidelity.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA
sequencing, Wu et al. (2011) demonstrated in mouse embryonic stem (ES)
cells that Tet1 is preferentially bound to CpG-rich sequences at
promoters of both transcriptionally active and Polycomb-repressed genes.
Despite an increase in levels of DNA methylation at many Tet1-binding
sites, Tet1 depletion does not lead to downregulation of all the Tet1
targets. Interestingly, although Tet1-mediated promoter hypomethylation
is required for maintaining the expression of a group of
transcriptionally active genes, it is also involved in repression of
Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators. Tet1 contributes to
silencing of this group of genes by facilitating recruitment of Polycomb
repressive complex-2 (PRC2; see 601573) to CpG-rich gene promoters.
Thus, Wu et al. (2011) concluded that their study not only establishes a
role for Tet1 in modulating DNA methylation levels at CpG-rich
promoters, but also reveals a dual function of Tet1 in promoting
transcription of pluripotency factors as well as participating in the
repression of Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators.

Pastor et al. (2011) described 2 novel and specific approaches to
profile the genomic localization of 5hmC. The first approach, which they
called GLIB (glucosylation, periodate oxidation, biotinylation), uses a
combination of enzymatic and chemical steps to isolate DNA fragments
containing as few as a single 5hmC. The second approach involves
conversion of 5hmC to cytosine 5-methylenesulfonate (CMS) by treatment
of genomic DNA with sodium bisulfite, followed by immunoprecipitation of
CMS-containing DNA with a specific antiserum to CMS. High-throughout
sequencing of 5hmC-containing DNA from mouse embryonic stem cells showed
strong enrichment within exons and near transcriptional start sites.
5hmC was especially enriched at the start sites of genes whose promoters
bear dual histone-3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone-3
lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks. Pastor et al. (2011) concluded
that 5hmC has a probable role in transcriptional regulation, and
suggested a model in which 5hmC contributes to the 'poised' chromatin
signature found at developmentally-regulated genes in embryonic stem
cells.

Ficz et al. (2011) used antibodies against 5hmC and 5mC together with
high-throughput sequencing to determine genomewide patterns of
methylation and hydroxymethylation in mouse wildtype and mutant ES cells
and differentiating embryoid bodies. They found that 5hmC is mostly
associated with euchromatin and that whereas 5mC is underrepresented at
gene promoters and CpG islands, 5hmC is enriched and is associated with
increased transcriptional levels. Most, if not all, 5hmC in the genome
depends on preexisting 5mC and the balance between these 2 modifications
is different between genomic regions. Knockdown of Tet1 and Tet2 causes
downregulation of a group of genes that includes pluripotency-related
genes (Esrrb, 602167; Prdm14, 611781; Dppa3, 608408; Klf2, 602016; Tcl1,
186960; and Zfp42) and a concomitant increase in methylation of their
promoters, together with an increased propensity of ES cells for
extraembryonic lineage differentiation. Declining levels of TETs during
differentiation are associated with decreased hydroxymethylation levels
at the promoters of ES cell-specific genes together with increased
methylation and gene silencing. Ficz et al. (2011) proposed that the
balance between hydroxymethylation and methylation in the genome is
inextricably linked with the balance between pluripotency and lineage
commitment.

Ito et al. (2011) showed that, in addition to 5hmC, the Tet proteins can
generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) from 5mC
in an enzymatic activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, Ito et al.
(2011) revealed the presence of 5fC and 5caC in genomic DNA of mouse
embryonic stem cells and mouse organs. The genomic content of 5hmC, 5fC,
and 5caC can be increased or reduced through overexpression or depletion
of Tet proteins. Thus, Ito et al. (2011) concluded that they identified
2 previously unknown cytosine derivatives in genomic DNA as the products
of Tet proteins, and raised the possibility that DNA demethylation may
occur through Tet-catalyzed oxidation followed by decarboxylation.

He et al. (2011) demonstrated that 5mC and 5hmC in DNA are oxidized to
5caC by Tet dioxygenases in vitro and in cultured cells. 5caC is
specifically recognized and excised by thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG;
601423). Depletion of TDG in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to
accumulation of 5caC to a readily detectable level. He et al. (2011)
concluded that oxidation of 5mC by Tet proteins followed by TDG-mediated
base excision of 5caC constitutes a pathway for active DNA
demethylation.

Guo et al. (2011) found that transfection of HEK293 cells with TET1
induced DNA replication-independent demethylation of 5hmC in the context
of both CpG and non-CpG DNA. Pharmacologic inhibition of the base
excision repair enzymes PARP (see 173870) or APE1 (APEX1; 107748)
reduced demethylation of 5hmC DNA. Expression of the cytidine deaminase
AID (AICDA; 605257) or of the APOBEC cytidine deaminases mouse Apobec1
(600130) or human APOBEC2 (604797), APOBEC3A (607109), APOBEC3C
(607750), or APOBEC3E (APOBEC3D; 609900), but not APOBEC3B (607110) or
APOBEC3G (607113), significantly increased demethylation of 5hmC DNA.
Overexpression of TET1 or AID in adult mouse dentate gyrus via
adenovirus-mediated gene transfer increased and decreased 5hmC levels,
respectively, and resulted in upregulated expression of brain-specific
variants of Bdnf (113505) and Fgf1 (131220). Knockdown of endogenous
Tet1 or Apobec1 expression in adult dentate gyrus abolished
stimulation-induced demethylation of brain-specific Bdnf and Fgf1
promoters. Guo et al. (2011) concluded that TET1, AID, and APOBEC
cooperate in a base excision-mediated pathway of active DNA
demethylation.

Using a loss-of-function approach in mice, Yamaguchi et al. (2012)
showed that the 5mC-specific dioxygenase Tet1 has an important role in
regulating meiosis in mouse oocytes. Tet1 deficiency significantly
reduced female germ cell numbers and fertility. Univalent chromosomes
and unresolved DNA double-strand breaks were also observed in
Tet1-deficient oocytes. Tet1 deficiency does not greatly affect the
genomewide demethylation that takes place in primordial germ cells, but
leads to defective DNA demethylation and decreased expression of a
subset of meiotic genes. Yamaguchi et al. (2012) concluded that their
study established a function for Tet1 in meiosis and meiotic gene
activation in female germ cells.

Mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo sequential epigenetic changes
and genomewide DNA demethylation to reset the epigenome for totipotency.
Hackett et al. (2013) demonstrated that erasure of CpG methylation in
PGCs occurs via conversion to 5hmC, driven by high levels of Tet1 and
Tet2 (612839). Global conversion to 5hmC initiates asynchronously among
PGCs at embryonic day (E) 9.5 to E10.5 and accounts for the unique
process of imprint erasure. Mechanistically, 5hmC enrichment is followed
by its protracted decline thereafter at a rate consistent with
replication-coupled dilution. The conversion to 5hmC is an important
component of parallel redundant systems that drive comprehensive
reprogramming in PGCs. Nonetheless, Hackett et al. (2013) identified
rare regulatory elements that escape systematic DNA demethylation in
PGCs, providing a potential mechanistic basis for transgenerational
epigenetic inheritance.

Using enhanced purification techniques and a stringent computational
algorithm, Costa et al. (2013) identified 27 high-confidence protein
interaction partners of Nanog (607937) in mouse embryonic stem cells.
These consisted of 19 partners of Nanog, including the ten-eleven
translocation (TET) family methylcytosine hydroxylase Tet1. Costa et al.
(2013) confirmed physical association of Nanog with Tet1, and
demonstrated that Tet1, in synergy with Nanog, enhanced the efficiency
of reprogramming. Costa et al. (2013) also found physical association
and reprogramming synergy of Tet2 with Nanog, and demonstrated that
knockdown of Tet2 abolished the reprogramming synergy of Nanog with a
catalytically deficient mutant of Tet1. These results indicated that the
physical interaction between Nanog and Tet1/Tet2 proteins facilitates
reprogramming in a manner that is dependent on the catalytic activity of
Tet1/Tet2. Tet1 and Nanog cooccupy genomic loci of genes associated with
both maintenance of pluripotency and lineage commitment in embryonic
stem cells, and Tet1 binding is reduced upon Nanog depletion.
Coexpression of Nanog and Tet1 increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels
at the top-ranked common target loci Esrrb (602167) and Oct4 (164177),
resulting in priming of their expression before reprogramming to naive
pluripotency. Costa et al. (2013) proposed that TET1 is recruited by
NANOG to enhance the expression of a subset of key reprogramming target
genes.

Blaschke et al. (2013) reported that addition of vitamin C to mouse
embryonic stem cells promotes Tet activity, leading to a rapid and
global increase in 5hmC. This is followed by DNA demethylation of many
gene promoters and upregulation of demethylated germline genes. Tet1
binding is enriched near the transcription start site of genes affected
by vitamin C treatment. Importantly, vitamin C, but not other
antioxidants, enhances the activity of recombinant Tet1 in a biochemical
assay, and the vitamin C-induced changes in 5hmC and 5mC are entirely
suppressed in Tet1 and Tet2 (612839) double-knockout embryonic stem
cells. Vitamin C has a stronger effect on regions that gain methylation
in cultured embryonic stem cells compared to blastocysts, and in vivo
are methylated only after implantation. In contrast, imprinted regions
and intracisternal A particle retroelements, which are resistant to
demethylation in the early embryo, are resistant to vitamin C-induced
DNA demethylation. Blaschke et al. (2013) concluded that the results of
this study established vitamin C as a direct regulator of Tet activity
and DNA methylation fidelity in embryonic stem cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ono et al. (2002) found that the TET1 gene consists of at least 12
exons.

MAPPING

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using expression cloning, Lacey et al. (1998) identified the ligand for
osteoprotegerin (OPG; 602643). The OPG ligand (OPGL) is a TNF-related
cytokine that replaces the requirement for stromal cells, vitamin D3,
and glucocorticoids in the coculture model of in vitro
osteoclastogenesis. The OPG ligand, which contains 317 amino acids,
binds to a unique hematopoietic progenitor cell that is committed to the
osteoclast lineage and stimulates the rapid induction of genes that
typify osteoclast development. The OPGL gene is mainly expressed in
lymph nodes and bone marrow stromal cells. In the skeleton, OPGL is
expressed in the primitive mesenchymal cells, in hypertrophying
chondrocytes, and in areas undergoing primary ossification and modeling.
OPGL directly activates isolated mature osteoclasts in vitro, and
short-term administration into normal adult mice results in osteoclast
activation associated with systemic hypercalcemia. These data suggested
to Lacey et al. (1998) that OPGL is an osteoclast differentiation and
activation factor. The effects of OPGL are blocked in vitro and in vivo
by OPG, suggesting that OPGL and OPG are key extracellular regulators of
osteoclast development.

Anderson et al. (1997), Wong et al. (1997), and Yasuda et al. (1998)
independently cloned OPGL cDNAs. Anderson et al. (1997) identified OPGL,
which they called RANKL for 'receptor activator of NF-kappa-B (164011)
ligand,' as a ligand for the TNF (191160) receptor RANK (603499). RANKL
augmented the ability of dendritic cells to stimulate naive T-cell
proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction and increased the survival
of RANK+ T cells generated with IL4 (147780) and TGF-beta. The predicted
317-amino acid RANKL protein is a type II transmembrane protein. Human
and mouse RANKL share 85% protein sequence identity. Northern blot
analysis revealed that RANKL is expressed predominantly in lymph node.
Wong et al. (1997) reported that a soluble form of OPGL, or TRANCE
(TNF-related activation-induced cytokine), consisting only of the
extracellular domain, can activate JNK (see 602896) in T cells but not
in B cells or bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. They suggested that
TRANCE plays a specific role in regulating T-cell functions. Yasuda et
al. (1998) referred to OPGL as ODF, osteoclast differentiation factor.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell and radiation hybrids, Anderson et al.
(1997) mapped the RANKL gene to chromosome 13q14. Using an interspecific
backcross, Wong et al. (1997) mapped the Trance gene to mouse chromosome
14.

GENE FUNCTION

TRANCE, a TNF family member, and its receptor, RANK, are critical
regulators of dendritic cell and osteoclast function. Wong et al. (1999)
demonstrated that TRANCE activates the antiapoptotic serine/threonine
kinase PKB (AKT1; 164730) through a signaling complex involving SRC
(190090) and TRAF6 (602355). A deficiency in SRC or addition of SRC
family kinase inhibitors blocked TRANCE-mediated PKB activation in
osteoclasts. SRC and TRAF6 interacted with each other and with RANK upon
receptor engagement. TRAF6, in turn, enhanced the kinase activity of
SRC, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling
molecules such as CBL (165360). These results defined a mechanism by
which TRANCE activates SRC family kinases and PKB, and provided evidence
of cross-talk between TRAF proteins and SRC family kinases.

Kong et al. (1999) reported that activated T cells can directly trigger
osteoclastogenesis through OPGL. Systemic activation of T cells in vivo
leads to an OPGL-mediated increase in osteoclastogenesis and bone loss.
In a T-cell-dependent model of rat adjuvant arthritis characterized by
severe joint inflammation, bone and cartilage destruction, and
crippling, blocking of OPGL through osteoprotegerin treatment at the
onset of disease prevents bone and cartilage destruction but not
inflammation. These results show that both systemic and local T-cell
activation can lead to OPGL production and subsequent bone loss, and
they provide a novel paradigm for T cells as regulators of bone
physiology.

Bone destruction, caused by aberrant production and activation of
osteoclasts, is a prominent feature of multiple myeloma (254500). Pearse
et al. (2001) demonstrated that myeloma stimulates osteoclastogenesis by
triggering a coordinated increase in TRANCE and decrease in its decoy
receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG; 602643). Immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization studies of bone marrow specimens indicated that, in vivo,
deregulation of the TRANCE-OPG cytokine axis occurred in myeloma, but
not in the limited plasma cell disorder monoclonal gammopathy of unknown
significance or in nonmyeloma hematologic malignancies. In coculture,
myeloma cell lines stimulated expression of TRANCE and inhibited
expression of OPG by stromal cells. In the murine model of human
myeloma, administration of a recombinant Trance inhibitor, Rank-Fc, both
prevented myeloma-induced bone destruction and interfered with myeloma
progression. These data identified TRANCE and OPG as key cytokines whose
deregulation promotes bone destruction and supports myeloma growth.

Croucher et al. (2001) demonstrated that myeloma cells express the
critical osteoclastogenic factor RANKL. Injection of myeloma cells into
a C57BL strain of mice resulted in development of bone disease
characterized by a significant decrease in cancellous bone volume in the
tibial and femoral metaphyses, an increase in osteoclast formation, and
radiologic evidence of osteolytic bone lesions. Treatment of mice with
established myeloma with recombinant OPG protein, the soluble decoy
receptor for RANKL, prevented the development of lytic bone lesions. OPG
treatment was associated with preservation of cancellous bone volume and
inhibition of osteoclast formation. OPG also promoted an increase in
femoral, tibial, and vertebral BMD. The data suggested that the
RANKL/RANK/OPG system may play a critical role in the development of
osteolytic bone disease in multiple myeloma and that targeting this
system may have therapeutic potential.

Sezer et al. (2003) reviewed the role of RANKL and OPG in myeloma bone
disease, the net effect of which is an increased RANKL-to-OPG ratio that
favors the formation and activation of osteoclasts. They noted that
patients with myeloma bone disease have inappropriately low serum and
bone marrow levels of OPG, and pointed out that specific blockade of
RANKL prevented the skeletal complications in various animal models of
myeloma and suppressed bone resorption in a preliminary study of
patients with myeloma bone disease.

Eghbali-Fatourechi et al. (2003) studied RANKL expression in bone marrow
mononuclear cells of 12 premenopausal women, 12 early-postmenopausal
women, and 12 age-matched estrogen-treated postmenopausal women, and
found that the surface concentration of RANKL per cell was 2- to 3-fold
higher in the untreated postmenopausal women compared to the other 2
groups. In the merged groups, increased RANKL expression per cell
correlated directly with increases in bone resorption markers and
inversely with serum 17-beta-estradiol levels.

Takayanagi et al. (2002) demonstrated that RANKL induces the IFN-beta
(147640) gene in osteoclast precursor cells, and that IFN-beta inhibits
the differentiation of osteoclasts by interfering with the RANKL-induced
expression of c-Fos (164810), an essential transcription factor for the
formation of osteoclasts. This IFN-beta gene induction mechanism is
distinct from that induced by virus, and is dependent on c-Fos itself.
Thus an autoregulatory mechanism operates--the RANKL-induced c-Fos
induces its own inhibitor. The importance of this regulatory mechanism
for bone homeostasis is emphasized by the observation that mice
deficient in IFN-beta signaling exhibit severe osteopenia accompanied by
enhanced osteoclastogenesis.

As explained by Glass et al. (2003), elevated serum levels of RANKL
occur in patients with myeloma, reflecting secretion by myeloma cells
with enhancement of osteoclast activity. The elevated serum levels of
DKK1 (605189) and RANKL in patients with myeloma may act systemically
and thus contribute to diffuse osteopenia and hypercalcemia that
frequently accompany this condition.

Koga et al. (2004) showed that mice lacking immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-harboring adaptors Fc receptor
common gamma subunit (147139) and DNAX-activating protein-12 (DAP12;
604142) exhibit severe osteopetrosis owing to impaired osteoclast
differentiation. In osteoclast precursor cells, Fc receptor-gamma and
DAP12 associated with multiple immunoreceptors and activated calcium
signaling through phospholipase C-gamma (see 172420). Thus,
ITAM-dependent costimulatory signals activated by multiple
immunoreceptors are essential for the maintenance of bone homeostasis.
Koga et al. (2004) concluded that RANKL and macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (120420) are not sufficient to activate the
signals required for osteoclastogenesis.

The treatment of AIDS with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART),
which includes HIV protease inhibitors, has been associated with bone
demineralization. To determine if this complication reflects accelerated
resorptive activity, Wang et al. (2004) studied the impact of 2 common
HIV protease inhibitors, ritonavir and indinavir, on osteoclast
formation and function. They found that ritonavir, but not indinavir,
inhibited osteoclast differentiation in a reversible manner and also
abrogated bone resorption by disrupting the osteoclast cytoskeleton,
without affecting cell number. Given in vivo, ritonavir completely
blunted parathyroid hormone (168450)-induced osteoclastogenesis in mice,
which confirmed that the drug is bone sparing. Wang et al. (2004) showed
that ritonavir functions by impairing RANKL-induced signaling. They
suggested that ritonavir may represent a bone-sparing protease inhibitor
capable of preventing development of osteopenia in patients on HAART.

TNF-induced RANKL synthesis by bone marrow stromal cells is a
fundamental component of inflammatory osteolysis. Wei et al. (2005)
found that TNF-induced RANKL expression in murine stromal cells was
mediated by IL1 (IL1A; 147760) via enhanced expression of IL1R1 (147810)
. IL1 had the capacity to directly target mononuclear osteoclast
precursors and promote their differentiation in the presence of
sufficient RANKL. Wei et al. (2005) concluded that IL1 is a key
downstream effector molecule in optimal TNF-induced osteoclastogenesis,
participating in the stimulation of stromal cell RANKL expression and in
the stimulation of osteoclast precursor differentiation.

Ikeda et al. (2004) generated transgenic mice expressing
dominant-negative c-Jun (165160) specifically in the osteoclast lineage
and found that they developed severe osteopetrosis due to impaired
osteoclastogenesis. Blockade of c-Jun signaling also markedly inhibited
soluble RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation in vitro.
Overexpression of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATC2; 600490)
or NFATC1 (600489) promoted differentiation of osteoclast precursor
cells into tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP-positive)
multinucleated osteoclast-like cells even in the absence of RANKL. These
osteoclastogenic activities of NFAT were abrogated by overexpression of
dominant-negative c-Jun. Ikeda et al. (2004) concluded that c-Jun
signaling in cooperation with NFAT is crucial for RANKL-regulated
osteoclast differentiation.

Jones et al. (2006) demonstrated that the cytokine RANKL triggers
migration of human epithelial cancer cells and melanoma cells that
express the receptor RANK (603499). RANK is expressed on cancer cell
lines and breast cancer cells in patients. In a mouse model of melanoma
metastasis, in vivo neutralization of RANKL by osteoprotegerin (602643)
results in complete protection from paralysis and a marked reduction in
tumor burden in bones but not in other organs. Jones et al. (2006)
concluded that local differentiation factors such as RANKL have an
important role in cell migration and the tissue-specific metastatic
behavior of cancer cells.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy, Loser et al. (2006) found that skin
from individuals with psoriasis (see 177900), but not skin from healthy
individuals or individuals with cutaneous lupus erythematosus, strongly
expressed RANKL in keratinocytes of all epidermal layers. In mice,
ultraviolet (UV) exposure induced Rankl expression. Transgenic mice
overexpressing Rankl under transcriptional control of the K14 (KRT14;
148066) promoter had reduced contact hypersensitivity (CHS) responses,
but showed no increase in circulating soluble Rankl. FACS analysis
showed that these transgenic mice had increased numbers of systemic Cd4
(186940)-positive/Cd25 (IL2RA; 147730)-positive T cells, whereas mice
lacking Rankl had markedly reduced numbers of these cells in spleen.
Confocal microscopy demonstrated coexpression of langerin (CD207;
604862) and Rank in Langerhans cells (LCs). Exposure of LCs to epidermal
Rankl made LCs less susceptible to apoptosis. Cutaneous Rankl expression
also reduced systemic Cd40l (CD40LG; 300386)-driven autoimmunity and
local cutaneous hyperallergic responses. Injection of Rank into
UV-irradiated mice resulted in protection from UV-induced
immunosuppression. Mice transplanted with Rankl -/- skin, but not
wildtype skin, had normal CHS responses, indicating protection from
UV-induced immunosuppression. Loser et al. (2006) concluded that RANKL
expression is inducible on keratinocytes and that this molecular pathway
couples the epidermis to local and systemic immunosuppression.

Hanada et al. (2009) reported that RANKL and RANK have an essential role
in the brain. In both mice and rats, central RANKL injections trigger
severe fever. Using tissue-specific Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed)
deleter mice, Hanada et al. (2009) genetically mapped the function of
RANK in the fever response to astrocytes. Importantly, Nestin-Cre and
GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) deleter mice are resistant to
lipopolysaccharide-induced fever as well as fever in response to the key
inflammatory cytokines IL-1-beta (147720) and TNF-alpha (191160).
Mechanistically, RANKL activates brain regions involved in
thermoregulation and induces fever via the COX2-PGE2 (see 600262)/EP3R
(176806) pathway. Moreover, female Nestin (600915)-Cre and GFAP
(137780)-Cre rank(floxed) mice exhibit increased basal body
temperatures, suggesting that RANKL and RANK control thermoregulation
during normal female physiology. Hanada et al. (2009) also found that 2
children with RANK mutations (see 603499.0003) exhibited impaired fever
during pneumonia. Hanada et al. (2009) concluded that their data
identified an entirely novel and unexpected function for the key
osteoclast differentiation factors RANKL/RANK in female thermoregulation
and the central fever response in inflammation.

Asselin-Labat et al. (2010) showed that mouse mammary stem cells (MaSCs)
are highly responsive to steroid hormone signaling, despite lacking the
estrogen and progesterone receptors. Ovariectomy markedly diminished
MaSC number and outgrowth potential in vivo, whereas MaSC activity
increased in mice treated with estrogen plus progesterone. Notably, even
3 weeks of treatment with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole was
sufficient to reduce the MaSC pool. In contrast, pregnancy led to a
transient 11-fold increase in MaSC numbers, probably mediated through
paracrine signaling from the RANK ligand. The augmented MaSC pool
indicates a cellular basis for the short-term increase in breast cancer
incidence that accompanies pregnancy. Asselin-Labat et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings further indicated that breast cancer
chemoprevention may be achieved, in part, through suppression of MaSC
function.

Joshi et al. (2010) showed that the MaSC pool increases 14-fold during
maximal progesterone levels at the luteal diestrus phase of the mouse.
Stem cell-enriched CD49f(hi) cells amplify at diestrus, or with
exogenous progesterone, demonstrating a key role for progesterone in
propelling this expansion. In aged mice, CD49f(hi) cells display stasis
upon cessation of the reproductive cycle. Progesterone drives a series
of events where luminal cells probably provide Wnt4 (603490) and Rankl
signals to basal cells which in turn respond by upregulating their
cognate receptors, transcriptional targets, and cell cycle markers.
Joshi et al. (2010) concluded that their findings uncovered a dynamic
role for progesterone in activating adult MaSCs within the mammary stem
cell niche during the reproductive cycle, where MaSCs are putative
targets for cell transformation events leading to breast cancer.

Schramek et al. (2010) demonstrated that in vivo administration of
medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), used in women for hormone replacement
therapy and contraceptives, triggers massive induction of the key
osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL in mammary gland epithelial
cells. Genetic inactivation of the RANKL receptor RANK in mammary gland
epithelial cells prevented MPA-induced epithelial proliferation,
impaired expansion of CD49f(hi) stem cell-enriched population, and
sensitized these cells to DNA damage-induced cell death. Deletion of
RANK from the mammary epithelium resulted in a markedly decreased
incidence and delayed onset of MPA-driven mammary cancer. Schramek et
al. (2010) concluded that the RANKL/RANK system controls the incidence
and onset of progestin-driven breast cancer.

Gonzalez-Suarez et al. (2010) showed that RANK and RANKL are expressed
within normal, premalignant, and neoplastic mammary epithelium, and,
using complementary gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches,
defined a direct contribution of this pathway in mammary tumorigenesis.
Accelerated preneoplasias and increased mammary tumor formation were
observed in MMTV-RANK transgenic mice after multiparity or treatment
with carcinogen and hormone (progesterone). Reciprocally, selective
pharmacologic inhibition of RANKL attenuated mammary tumor development
not only in hormone- and carcinogen-treated MMTV-RANK and wildtype mice,
but also in the MMTV-neu transgenic spontaneous tumor model. The
reduction in tumorigenesis upon RANKL inhibition was preceded by a
reduction in preneoplasias as well as rapid and sustained reductions in
hormone- and carcinogen-induced mammary epithelial proliferation and
cyclin D1 (168461) levels. Gonzalez-Suarez et al. (2010) concluded that
RANKL inhibition is acting directly on hormone-induced mammary
epithelium at early stages in tumorigenesis, and the permissive
contribution of progesterone to increased mammary cancer incidence is
due to RANKL-dependent proliferative changes in the mammary epithelium.

Tan et al. (2011) examined whether RANKL, RANK (603499), and IKK-alpha
(600664) are involved in mammary/breast cancer metastasis. RANK
signaling in mammary carcinoma cells that overexpress the protooncogene
Erbb2 (also known as Neu; 164870), which is frequently amplified in
metastatic human breast cancers, was important for pulmonary metastasis.
Metastatic spread of Erbb2-transformed carcinoma cells also required
CD4(186940)+CD25(147730)+ T cells, whose major prometastatic function
was RANKL production. Most RANKL-producing T cells expressed FOXP3
(300292), a transcription factor produced by regulatory T cells, and
were located next to smooth muscle actin (see 102540)-positive stromal
cells in mouse and human breast cancers. The dependence of pulmonary
metastasis on T cells was replaceable by exogenous RANKL, which also
stimulated pulmonary metastasis of RANK-positive human breast cancer
cells. Tan et al. (2011) concluded that their results were consistent
with the adverse impact of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ or FOXP3+ T cells on
human breast cancer prognosis and suggested that the targeting of
RANKL-RANK can be used in conjunction with the therapeutic elimination
of primary breast tumors to prevent recurrent metastatic disease.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Luan et al. (2012) reported the 2.7-angstrom crystal structure of the
human RANKL trimer in complex with the N-terminal fragment of human OPG
containing 4 cys-rich TNFR homologous domains (OPG-CRD). Structure-based
mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the RANKL
trimer uses 3 equivalent grooves between 2 neighboring monomers to
interact with 3 OPG-CRD monomers symmetrically. The results revealed
that OPG exerts its decoy receptor function by directly blocking the
accessibility of important interacting residues of RANKL, including
arg223, tyr241, and lys257, for RANK recognition.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Sobacchi et al. (2007) analyzed the TNFSF11 gene in 6 patients from 4
unrelated families with an autosomal recessive osteoclast-poor form of
osteopetrosis (OPTB2; 259710) that was unresponsive to hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation and identified homozygosity for 3 different
mutations in all affected individuals: a 5-bp deletion (602642.0001) in
a consanguineous Tunisian family, a missense mutation (M199K;
602642.0002) in 2 Sikh families, and a 2-bp deletion (602642.0003) in a
consanguineous Kurdish family. Exogenous RANKL induced formation of
functional osteoclasts in vitro from peripheral blood monocytes obtained
from these patients.

In a genomewide association study to find common sequence variants that
influence bone mineral density and low-trauma fractures in 3 populations
of European descent, Styrkarsdottir et al. (2008) identified 2
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a linkage disequilibrium block
adjacent to the RANKL gene on chromosome 13q14 (see BMND9, 612110).

ANIMAL MODEL

Osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL) is a key osteoclast
differentiation/activation factor essential for bone remodeling. Fata et
al. (2000) reported that mice lacking OPGL or its receptor RANK failed
to form lobulo-alveolar mammary structures during pregnancy, resulting
in death of newborns. Transplantation and OPGL-rescue experiments in
Opgl -/- and Rank -/- pregnant females showed that OPGL acts directly on
RANK-expressing mammary epithelial cells. The effects of OPGL were
autonomous to epithelial cells. The mammary gland defect in female Opgl
-/- mice was characterized by enhanced apoptosis and failures in
proliferation and PKB activation in lobulo-alveolar buds that could be
reversed by recombinant OPGL treatment.

Kim et al. (2000) reported the skeletal phenotype of TRANCE-deficient
mice and its rescue by the TRANCE transgene specifically expressed in
lymphocytes. TRANCE-deficient mice showed severe osteopetrosis, with no
osteoclasts, marrow spaces, or tooth eruption, and exhibited profound
growth retardation at several skeletal sites, including the limbs,
skull, and vertebrae. These mice had marked chondrodysplasia, with
thick, irregular growth plates and a relative increase in hypertrophic
chondrocytes. Transgenic overexpression of TRANCE in lymphocytes of
TRANCE-deficient mice rescued osteoclast development in 2 locations in
growing long bones: excavation of marrow cavities permitting
hematopoiesis in the marrow spaces, and remodeling of osteopetrotic
woven bone in the shafts of long bones into histologically normal
lamellar bone. However, osteoclasts in these mice were not present at
the chondroosseous junction and the metaphyseal periosteum of long
bones, or in tooth eruption pathways. These defects resulted in
sclerotic metaphyses with persistence of club-shaped long bones and
unerupted teeth, and the growth plate defects were largely unimproved by
the TRANCE transgene. Thus, TRANCE-mediated regulation of the skeleton
is complex, and impacts chondrocyte differentiation and osteoclast
formation in a manner that likely requires local delivery of TRANCE.

Nakashima et al. (2011) generated mice expressing green fluorescent
protein specifically in osteocytes and found that Rankl mRNA and protein
expression was more than 10-fold higher in osteocytes than in
osteoblasts. Furthermore, osteocytes had a more potent ability to
support osteoclastogenesis than osteoblasts. Mice lacking Rankl in
osteocytes had a severe osteopetrotic phenotype. Nakashima et al. (2011)
concluded that osteocytes are a crucial, if not exclusive, source of
RANKL required for osteoclastogenesis.

Using mice with conditional deletion of Rankl in genetically defined
cell populations, Xiong et al. (2011) identified hypertrophic
chondrocytes and osteocytes, both of which are embedded within
mineralized cartilage, as essential sources of the Rankl that controls
resorption of mineralized cartilage and bone remodeling, respectively.
Mice lacking Rankl in osteocytes were protected from bone loss owing to
unloading. Xiong et al. (2011) concluded that RANKL produced by
osteoblasts or their progenitors does not contribute to adult bone
remodeling and suggested that the rate-limiting step of matrix
resorption is controlled by cells embedded within the matrix itself.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OSTEOPETROSIS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 2
TNFSF11, 5-BP DEL, IVS7+4

In a 6-year-old boy with osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis (OPTB2; 259710),
born of consanguineous Tunisian parents, Sobacchi et al. (2007)
identified homozygosity for a 5-bp deletion in intron 7 (532+4_532+8del)
of the TNFSF11 gene, predicted to cause skipping of exon 7 and an
in-frame deletion. The parents and 1 healthy brother were heterozygous
for the mutation; exon skipping was confirmed in cells from the
heterozygous brother. The mutation was not found in another healthy
brother or 120 geographically-matched control chromosomes.

.0002
OSTEOPETROSIS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 2
TNFSF11, MET199LYS

In 2 sisters, aged 11 years and 6 years, and a 7-month-old boy with
osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis (259710), from 2 unrelated Sikh families
that were both apparently nonconsanguineous, Sobacchi et al. (2007)
identified homozygosity for a 596T-A transversion in exon 8 of the
TNFSF11 gene, resulting in a met199-to-lys (M199K) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. The parents were all heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 100 control chromosomes from an
unmatched population or in 120 control chromosomes from a Sikh
population.

.0003
OSTEOPETROSIS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 2
TNFSF11, 2-BP DEL, 828CG

In 2 female cousins, aged 12 years and 3 months, respectively, with
osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis (259710), both born of consanguineous
Kurdish parents, Sobacchi et al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a
2-bp deletion (828delCG) in the last exon of the TNFSF11 gene. The
deletion results in a frameshift and a premature termination codon
predicted to cause loss of the beta-G, beta-H, and beta-F strands of
TNFSF11, which are important for its trimerization.

614657	TITLE *614657 ANGIOMOTIN-LIKE 1; AMOTL1
;;JUNCTION-ENRICHED AND -ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; JEAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to angiomotin (AMOT;
300410), Bratt et al. (2002) identified AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 (614658). The
deduced 956-amino acid AMOTL1 protein contains a conserved N-terminal
glutamine-rich domain, followed by 2 coiled-coil domains and a
C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 lack the angiostatin
(173350)-binding domain found in angiomotin. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues detected an approximately 8.3-kb Amotl1 transcript that
was highly expressed in brain, heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and
uterus, with much lower expression in most other tissues.

Nishimura et al. (2002) cloned mouse Amotl1, which they called Jeap. The
deduced 882-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 98.4
kD. Jeap has an N-terminal polyglutamic acid repeat, followed by a
central coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif.
Fluorescence-tagged Jeap colocalized with Zo1 (TJP1; 601009) at tight
junctions along the apical regions of lateral membranes of transfected
canine kidney cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse tissues
detected Jeap expression in exocrine glands, including pancreas,
submandibular gland, lacrimal gland, parotid gland, and sublingual
gland, but not in brain, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, gall bladder, or
duodenum. In exocrine glands, Jeap localized to the terminal portion of
serous glands. It did not localize to any endothelial cells. Western
blot analysis detected Jeap at an apparent molecular mass of about 105
kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2012) found that overexpression of AMOT, AMOTL1, or AMOTL2 in
HEK293T cells repressed WNT1 (164820)-dependent activation of a reporter
gene. Conversely, knockdown of all 3 genes simultaneously via small
hairpin RNA significantly increased WNT1 reporter gene activity.
However, knockdown of AMOT, AMOTL1, or AMOTL2 individually had little
effect, suggesting that they have overlapping functions in repressing
WNT activity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the AMOTL1 gene to chromosome 11q21 based on an
alignment of the AMOTL1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF453742) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

EVOLUTION

Phylogenetic analysis by Bratt et al. (2002) suggested that angiomotin,
AMOTL1, and AMOTL2 form separate clades and that these clades arose from
a duplication of a common ancestral sequence.

DESCRIPTION Receptors for the Fc region (FcRs) of immunoglobulins (Igs) modulate
cellular and humoral immunity by linking their antibody ligands with
effector cells of the immune system. FcRs sense humoral concentrations
of antibody, initiate cellular responses in host defense, and
participate in autoimmune disorders.

CLONING

By EST database searching for immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
motif (ITIM)-bearing receptor proteins, Xu et al. (2001) identified a
cDNA encoding SPAP1A (SH2 domain-containing phosphatase anchor
protein-1A). The deduced 255-amino acid transmembrane protein contains 2
ITIMs. Further searches and sequencing identified a 192-amino acid
splice variant, SPAP1B, lacking the intracellular ITIMs, and a 144-amino
acid isoform, SPAP1C, lacking the transmembrane segment. RT-PCR analysis
detected SPAP1A expression in spleen, peripheral blood, bone marrow, and
B-cell lines, but not in other tissues. SPAP1C was also detected in
Jurkat and B-cell lines but SPAP1B was not detected in any samples
tested. Western blot analysis showed expression of SPAP1A as a 38- and
40-kD doublet protein reduced to 32 kD or 28 kD by N-glycosidase or
O-glycosidase treatment, respectively. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that SPAP1A ITIMs recruit the SHP1 (PTPN6; 176883), but not the SHP2
(PTPN11; 176876), tyrosine phosphatase, a major negative regulator of
hematopoietic cell signaling.

By database searching using a consensus sequence corresponding to the
second Ig-like domains of FCGR1A (146760), FCGR2A (146790), and FCGR3A
(146740) as well as the third Ig-like domain of the polymeric Ig
receptor (PIGR; 173880), Davis et al. (2001) identified 2 BAC clones
located at chromosome 1q21.1-q22. They found that one of these clones
contained 3 novel putative Ig superfamily genes, which they designated
FCRH1 (606508), FCRH2, and FCRH3 (606510), as well as 2 previously
identified members of this family, FCRH4 (IRTA1; 605876) and FCRH5
(IRTA2; 605877). Sequence analysis predicted that the 508-amino acid
type I transmembrane protein possesses a hydrophobic signal peptide, 4
extracellular C2 type Ig-like domains, 5 N-linked glycosylation sites,
an uncharged transmembrane segment, and an 86-amino acid cytoplasmic
tail with 1 ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) and 2
ITIMs. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of approximately 3.0-,
4.4- and 5.5-kb transcripts chiefly in spleen and lymph nodes and a
2.4-kb transcript in kidney. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in
mature B-cell lines. Davis et al. (2001) suggested that FCRH2 may have
an activating/inhibitory or a fine-tuning role in regulation of
immunologic function.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Davis et al. (2001) determined that the
FCRH2 gene contains 12 exons that span approximately 30 kb.

MAPPING

By BAC and genomic sequence analysis, Davis et al. (2001) mapped the
FCRH2 gene to chromosome 1q21.2-q22, near the classic FCGR loci.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 2-prime,5-prime oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs), such as OAS3, are
interferon-induced proteins characterized by their capacity to catalyze
the synthesis of 2-prime,5-prime oligomers of adenosine (2-5As)
(Hovnanian et al., 1998). For further information on OASs, see OAS1
(164350).

CLONING

Hovanessian et al. (1987) found that interferon-treated human cells
contain several OASs corresponding to proteins of 40 (OAS1), 46 (OAS1),
69 (OAS2; 603350), and 100 (OAS3) kD. Hovnanian et al. (1998) reported
that the predicted OAS3, or p100, protein contains 3 adjacent OAS1-like
domains. The domains share 44 to 60% protein sequence similarity with
each other and 42 to 60% sequence identity with the conserved domain of
OAS1. The authors noted that OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 contain 1, 2, and 3
conserved OAS domains or units, respectively. Northern blot analysis
revealed that OAS3 is expressed as a 7-kb interferon-induced mRNA in
HeLa cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by inclusion within mapped
clones, Hovnanian et al. (1998) determined that the OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3
genes are clustered with a 130-kb region on chromosome 12q24.2.

103320	TITLE *103320 AGRIN; AGRN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Agrin is a neuronal aggregating factor that induces the aggregation of
acetylcholine receptors and other postsynaptic proteins on muscle fibers
and is crucial for the formation of the neuromuscular junction.

CLONING

Rupp et al. (1991) isolated cDNAs from a rat embryonic spinal cord
library using an agrin cDNA clone isolated from electromotor neurons of
a marine ray. Analysis of a set of clones predicted a protein with 1,940
amino acids, including 141 cysteine residues. The predicted protein had
9 domains homologous to protease inhibitors, a region similar to domain
III of laminin (see 150240), and 4 epidermal growth factor (131530)
repeats. The gene was expressed in rat embryonic nervous system and
muscle. The protein was concentrated at synapses. Rupp et al. (1992)
described alternative RNA splicing in mammalian agrin resulting in many
extracellular matrix protein isoforms.

MAPPING

Rupp et al. (1992) mapped the human AGRN gene to 1pter-p32 by analysis
of Chinese hamster/human somatic cell hybrids, including one that
carried chromosome 1 region p32-qter (which was negative for the human
signal). The mouse gene was mapped to chromosome 4 by study of Chinese
hamster/mouse somatic cell hybrids. Thus, this is another example of
extensive homology of synteny between 1pter-p32 and the distal half of
mouse chromosome 4. Three neurologic mutants in that region of mouse
chromosome 4 were pointed to as possible candidate diseases for
mutations in the Agrn gene.

GENE FUNCTION

An important event in synapse formation is the accumulation of
neurotransmitter receptors beneath the presynaptic nerve terminal. Agrin
is a component of the synaptic basal lamina that induces the clustering
(aggregation) of acetylcholine receptors (e.g., 100690) on cultured
muscle fibers. Campanelli et al. (1991) showed that when a cDNA encoding
a putative agrin protein is transfected into cells, the molecule is
secreted and concentrated on the extracellular surface. Coculture of
transfected cells with muscle fibers induced formation of receptor
patches at contact sites. These results demonstrated that expression of
a single gene encoding agrin confers receptor clustering that is
restricted to specific sites of contact between the synthesizing cell
and muscle. DeChiara et al. (1996) showed that agrin acts through the
skeletal muscle tyrosine kinase receptor MuSK (601296) to activate
signaling cascades responsible for all aspects of synapse formation,
including organization of the postsynaptic membrane, synapse-specific
transcription, and presynaptic differentiation. In mouse muscle and
cultured myotube cells, Finn et al. (2003) showed that the tyrosine
kinases Abl1 (189980) and Abl2 (164690) are concentrated at the
postsynaptic neuromuscular junction and are mediators of postsynaptic
AChR clustering downstream of agrin and MuSK signaling. The authors
suggested that the Abl kinases influence cytoskeletal regulatory
molecules important for synapse assembly and remodeling.

In cultured myocytes, Wang et al. (2003) found that agrin-induced AChR
postsynaptic aggregation required the tumor suppressor gene APC
(611731), which was found to colocalize and bind specifically to the
AChR beta subunit (100710). The interaction occurred downstream of MuSK
activation. Wang et al. (2003) suggested that a direct interaction
between APC and the AChR beta subunit may link AChR to the cytoskeleton,
helping to localize the receptors to the neuromuscular junction.

T-cell activation is dependent on both a primary signal delivered
through the T-cell receptor and a secondary costimulatory signal
mediated by coreceptors. Costimulation is thought to act through the
specific redistribution and clustering of membrane and intracellular
kinase-rich lipid raft microdomains at the contact site between T cells
and antigen-presenting cells. This site has been termed the immunologic
synapse. Khan et al. (2001) demonstrated that agrin, an aggregating
protein crucial for formation of the neuromuscular junction, is also
expressed in lymphocytes and is important in reorganization of membrane
lipid microdomains and setting the threshold for T-cell signaling. Khan
et al. (2001) concluded that agrin induces the aggregation of signaling
proteins and the creation of signaling domains in both immune and
nervous systems through a common lipid raft pathway.

In addition to its role at the neuromuscular junction, agrin has been
implicated in brain development. Through biochemical studies, Hilgenberg
et al. (2006) found that agrin bound the alpha-3 subunit of the
Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (ATP1A3; 182350) in mouse cortical neurons.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Atp1a3 colocalized with
agrin-binding sites at synapses. Agrin inhibited Atp1a3 activity,
resulting in membrane depolarization and increased action potential
frequency in mouse cortical neurons in culture and acute slice. An agrin
fragment that acted as a competitive antagonist depressed action
potential frequency, indicating that endogenous agrin regulates native
Atp1a3 function. Hilgenberg et al. (2006) concluded that agrin regulates
activity-dependent processes in neurons through its interaction with
ATP1A3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Swiss brother and sister with congenital myasthenic syndrome
(254300), Huze et al. (2009) identified a homozygous mutation in the
AGRN gene (G1709R; 103320.0001). Mutant agrin was expressed and
localized correctly in patient muscle, but the overall organization of
the neuromuscular junction was perturbed, affecting both the pre- and
postsynaptic regions. AChR clustering and density was not affected. The
findings suggested that agrin also helps to maintain the neuromuscular
junction.

ANIMAL MODEL

Data on the structure, expression, and bioactivity of agrin all support
the notion that it plays a central role in regulating postsynaptic
differentiation. However, agrin is only one of several agents that can
cause clustering of acetylcholine receptors in vitro. To test critically
the 'agrin hypothesis' (McMahan, 1990), Gautam et al. (1996) generated
knockout mice deficient for agrin and showed that neuromuscular
differentiation is grossly defective in these mice. Some postsynaptic
differentiation occurred in the mutant, suggesting the existence of a
second nerve-derived synaptic organizing signal.

Formation of the neuromuscular junction depends upon reciprocal
inductive interactions between the developing nerve and muscle,
resulting in the precise juxtaposition of a differentiated nerve
terminal with a highly specialized patch on the muscle membrane, termed
the motor endplate. Agrin is a nerve-derived factor involved in
induction of the molecular reorganization at the motor endplate. Glass
et al. (1996) found that mice lacking either agrin or the receptor
tyrosine kinase MuSK (601296) exhibit similar profound defects at the
neuromuscular junction. DeChiara et al. (1996) showed in knockout mice
that MuSK is required for formation of the neuromuscular junction in
vivo.

Lin et al. (2001) analyzed early stages of postsynaptic differentiation
in muscles of mutant mice lacking agrin, MuSK, rapsyn (601592), and/or
motor nerves. Lin et al. (2001) found that the defect in MuSK mutants is
due to an absence of initiation of postsynaptic differentiation, whereas
the impairment in agrin mutants is caused by loss of agrin-dependent
maintenance of the postsynaptic apparatus. On the basis of these and
previous studies, Lin et al. (2001) proposed the existence of 3 early
overlapping steps in the formation of the postsynaptic apparatus at the
neuromuscular junction. First, a muscle-intrinsic,
nerve/agrin-independent and MuSK-dependent mechanism initiates formation
of postsynaptic specialization in an end-plate band. Second,
nerve-derived agrin acts through MuSK to promote apposition of nerve
terminals to these nerve-independent acetylcholine receptor clusters
and/or to induce new postsynaptic sites. Agrin is also required for the
growth and maintenance of most, if not all, synaptic sites. Third, motor
axons, or Schwann cells that accompany them, provide an
agrin-independent signal that destabilizes or disperses postsynaptic
apparatus that have not been stabilized by agrin.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYASTHENIA, LIMB-GIRDLE, FAMILIAL
AGRN, GLY1709ARG

In a sister and brother with congenital myasthenic syndrome mostly
affecting the limb-girdle muscles (254300), Huze et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous 5125G-C transversion in exon 29 of the AGRN
gene, resulting in a gly1709-to-arg (G1709R) substitution in the
C-terminal laminin G-like 2 (LG2) domain. Both patients were unable to
run since childhood and had mild muscle weakness as adults. Neither had
diplopia, bulbar symptoms, or dyspnea. The mutation was not found in 200
control alleles. Skeletal muscle biopsy showed pre- and postsynaptic
defects at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), although mutant agrin
staining was localized correctly. In vitro functional expression studies
in myotubes showed that mutant agrin did not significantly impair AChR
clustering, activation of MuSK (601296), or the interaction with
alpha-dystroglycan (DAG; 128239). Injection of the mutant protein into
rat muscle did not affect AChR recruit or expression at the NMJ.
However, the NMJ showed remodeling and denervation: the presynaptic
department had disheveled neurofilaments, and the postsynaptic
compartment had increased synaptic gutter fragments. Huze et al. (2009)
concluded that the mutant agrin destabilized the preexisting NMJ,
suggesting that wildtype agrin is involved in the maintenance of the
NMJ.

;;FP REGULATORY PROTEIN; FPRP;;
CD9 PARTNER 1; CD9P1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Orlicky et al. (1996) isolated a protein that copurifies with bovine
prostaglandin F(2-alpha) receptor (PTGFR; 600563) and cloned the
corresponding rat cDNA. Transfection experiments suggested that this
protein, which the authors designated FP regulatory protein (FPRP),
inhibits binding of PGF(2-alpha) to PTGFR. Histologically, FPRP showed a
distribution coinciding well with those cells and tissues that respond
to PGF(2-alpha).

By screening cDNA libraries for sequences with the potential to encode
large proteins expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (2000) identified a
cDNA encoding FPRP, which they termed KIAA1436. The deduced 924-amino
acid protein was predicted to be 89% identical to rat Fprp. RT-PCR
analysis detected wide expression that was highest in ovary and lung.

By mass spectrometric and flow cytometric analyses of an
immunoprecipitated protein, CD9P1, that interacts with CD9 (143030) and
is expressed in HeLa cells, Charrin et al. (2001) determined that CD9P1
is identical to KIAA1436. SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a
135-kD protein under reducing conditions, which was lowered to 125 kD
and 106 kD by sialidase and N-glycanase treatments, respectively.
Further immunoprecipitation analysis showed that CD9P1 interacts with
CD81 (186845). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated expression in
keratinocytes and, faintly, in salivary glands, but not in other
tissues. In contrast, CD9P1 was strongly expressed in a number of cancer
cell lines, suggesting a possible upregulation during tumorigenesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Stipp et al. (2001) used moderately stringent Brij96/97 detergent
extraction to show that FPRP associates specifically with CD81 and CD9
but not with other tetraspanin molecules, such as CD151 (602243). They
determined that nearly all cell surface FPRP is associated with CD9 and
CD81.

MAPPING

Orlicky et al. (1996) subcloned and sequenced a portion of the 3-prime
untranslated region of the human homolog to FPRP, and oligonucleotide
primers were designed that allowed PCR amplification specifically of the
human FPRP sequence. Using these primers for PCR-based mapping, the FPRP
gene was localized to chromosome 1 through analysis of human/rodent
somatic cell hybrids and to 1p13.1-q21.3 by analysis of YAC pools.

610971	TITLE *610971 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 4; TRAPPC4
;;SYNBINDIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ethell et al. (2000) cloned mouse Trappc4, which they called synbindin.
The deduced 219-amino acid protein contains segments of homology with
proteins involved in vesicular transport or synaptic function, including
a nonclassical PDZ domain, followed by a TRAPPC1 (610969)-like domain,
and a C-terminal tail similar to a short cytoplasmic segment of RYR2
(180902). By database analysis, Ethell et al. (2000) identified human
synbindin, which also encodes a 219-amino acid protein. Northern blot
analysis of several mouse tissues detected highest expression in liver
and skeletal muscle, followed by kidney, heart, and brain. RT-PCR, in
situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical analysis detected strong
synbindin expression in differentiated neurons. In adult mouse CNS,
expression was highest in large neurons such as pyramidal neurons,
Purkinje cells, and motor neurons and weak or undetectable in smaller
granule-type neurons. Immunogold electron microscopy of adult mouse
cerebral cortex detected synbindin predominantly in postsynaptic
membranes and postsynaptic densities, intracellular vesicles in the
dendritic shaft, membrane cisternae, and in the Golgi apparatus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid experiments, coimmunoprecipitation assays, and in
vitro pull-down assays, Ethell et al. (2000) demonstrated that mouse
synbindin interacted directly with rat syndecan-2 (SDC2; 142460). Yeast
2-hybrid analysis also showed that synbindin interacted with rat
syndecan-4 (SDC4; 600017). Mutation analysis showed that the interaction
required the PDZ-like domain of synbindin and the EFYA motif in the
C-terminal domain of Sdc2. Primary rat hippocampal neurons transfected
with synbindin and Sdc2 expressed the proteins in clusters along
dendritic spines. Sdc2 lacking the EFYA motif formed clusters that
lacked synbindin, suggesting synbindin clustering was dependent on Sdc2.
Ethell et al. (2000) concluded that synbindin has a role in postsynaptic
membrane trafficking.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRAPPC4
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-20793).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tissue-specific transcription is regulated in part by cell
type-restricted proteins that bind to defined sequences in target genes.
The DNA-binding domain of these proteins is often evolutionarily
conserved; on this basis, liver-enriched transcription factors have been
classified into various families. See, for example, HNF3A (602294) and
HNF1A (142410). Lemaigre et al. (1996) isolated from rat liver a
transcription factor, which they called hepatocyte nuclear factor-6,
that contains 2 different DNA-binding domains: a novel type of
homeodomain, and a homolog of the Drosophila cut domain. A similar
bipartite sequence had been found only in the genome of Caenorhabditis
elegans. The HNF6 cDNA encodes a deduced protein of 465 amino acids. By
RNase protection assay, the expression of HNF6 was found to be highest
in liver, but was also detectable in brain, spleen, and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

By RT-PCR, Jacquemin et al. (1999) determined the tissue distribution of
ONECUT1 in 12 human tissues. They found strong ONECUT1 expression in
liver and lower expression in testis and skin.

Vaisse et al. (1997) found that all members of the HNF3 family as well
as HNF4G (605966) and HNF6 are expressed in pancreatic beta cells. They
also identified and characterized simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphisms
in all of these genes.

Samadani and Costa (1996) determined that HNF6 activates transcription
of the promoters of HNF3B (600288) and TTR (176300). Further studies
suggested that HNF6 is important not only for the regulation of a wide
variety of genes expressed in hepatocytes and, putatively, intestinal
epithelium, but also for the inception of gut endoderm-derived organs
via activation of the HNF3B protein.

Glucocorticoids exert their effects on gene transcription through
ubiquitous receptors that bind to regulatory sequences present in many
genes. These glucocorticoid receptors are present in all cell types, yet
glucocorticoid action is controlled in a tissue-specific way. The
mechanism for this control relies on tissue-specific transcriptional
activators that bind in the vicinity of the glucocorticoid receptor and
are required for receptor action. Pierreux et al. (1999) described a
gene-specific and tissue-specific inhibitory mechanism through which
glucocorticoid action is repressed by a tissue-restricted transcription
factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-6. HNF6 inhibits the
glucocorticoid-induced stimulation of 2 genes coding for enzymes of
liver glucose metabolism, namely 6-phosphofructo-2 kinase (PFKFB1;
311790) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1; 261680). Binding of
HNF6 to DNA is required for inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor
activity. In vitro and in vivo experiments suggested that this
inhibition is mediated by a direct HNF6/glucocorticoid receptor
interaction involving the N-terminal domain of HNF6 and the DNA-binding
domain of the receptor. Thus, in addition to its known property of
stimulating transcription of liver-expressed genes, HNF6 can antagonize
glucocorticoid-stimulated gene transcription.

To gain insight into the transcriptional regulatory networks that
specify and maintain human tissue diversity, Odom et al. (2004) used
chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with promoter microarrays to
identify systematically the genes occupied by the transcriptional
regulators HNF1-alpha, HNF4-alpha (600281), and HNF6, together with RNA
polymerase II (see 180660), in human liver and pancreatic islets. Odom
et al. (2004) identified tissue-specific regulatory circuits formed by
HNF1-alpha, HNF4-alpha, and HNF6 with other transcription factors,
revealing how these factors function as master regulators of hepatocyte
and islet transcription.

Odom et al. (2007) analyzed the binding of HNF3B, HNF1A, HNF4A, and HNF6
to 4,000 orthologous gene pairs in hepatocytes purified from human and
mouse livers. Despite the conserved function of these factors, 41 to 89%
of the binding events seemed to be species-specific. Importantly, the
binding sites varied widely between species in ways that could not be
predicted from human-mouse sequence alignments alone.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Vaisse et al. (1997) mapped the
HNF6A gene to 15q21.1-q21.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

During mouse development, Hnf6 is expressed in the epithelial cells that
are precursors of the exocrine and endocrine pancreatic cells. Jacquemin
et al. (2000) investigated the role of Hnf6 in pancreas differentiation
by inactivating its gene in the mouse. In hnf6-null embryos, the
exocrine pancreas appeared to be normal but endocrine cell
differentiation was impaired. The expression of neurogenin-3 (NGN3;
604882), a transcription factor that is essential for determination of
endocrine cell precursors, was almost abolished. Consistent with this,
Jacquemin et al. (2000) demonstrated that Hnf6 binds to and stimulates
the ngn3 gene promoter. At birth, only a few endocrine cells were found
and the islets of Langerhans were missing. Later, the number of
endocrine cells increased and islets appeared. However, the architecture
of the islets was perturbed, and the beta cells were deficient in
glucose transporter-2 (SLC2A2; 138160) expression. Adult hnf6-null mice
were diabetic. The authors concluded that Hnf6 controls pancreatic
endocrine differentiation at the precursor stage and stated that their
data identify Hnf6 as the first positive regulator of the proendocrine
gene ngn3 in the pancreas.

During pancreatic organogenesis, endocrine cells arise from
non-self-renewing progenitors that express Ngn3. Maestro et al. (2003)
showed that from E13 to E18 (the embryonic stage during which the major
burst of beta-cell neogenesis takes place) murine pancreatic duct cells
express Hnf1b (189907), the product of the maturity-onset diabetes of
the young type-5 (MODY5; 137920) gene. Ngn3-positive cells at this stage
invariably cluster with mitotically competent Hnf1b-positive cells and
are often intercalated with these cells in the epithelium that lines the
lumen of primitive ducts. Hnf1b expression is markedly reduced in early
pancreatic epithelial cells of Hnf6-deficient mice, in which formation
of Ngn3-positive cells is defective. Maestro et al. (2003) suggested
that Hnf1b plays a role in the genetic hierarchy regulating the
generation of pancreatic endocrine cells.

601265	TITLE *601265 NODAL, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; NODAL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

NODAL is a member of the TGF-beta gene family and is expressed during
mouse gastrulation (Zhou et al., 1993). Nodal has a left-sided
expression pattern that is disrupted in mouse models of LR axis
development (see Lowe et al. (1996)).

Gebbia et al. (1997) stated that they had characterized the human
homolog of mouse Nodal to search for mutations in individuals with LR
axis malformations.

GENE FUNCTION

Collignon et al. (1996) showed that some mice manifest LR axis
malformations when doubly heterozygous for null mutations in Nodal and
in the transcription factor Hnf3b (600288).

Olson and Srivastava (1996) reviewed the role of the morphogen Nodal in
the control of the direction of cardiac looping and in the development
of left to right asymmetry in chick and mouse.

Brennan et al. (2001) demonstrated that signals from the epiblast are
responsible for the initiation of the proximal-distal polarity in the
mouse embryo. Nodal acts to promote posterior cell fates in the epiblast
and to maintain molecular pattern in the adjacent extra-embryonic
ectoderm. Both of these functions are independent of SMAD2 (601366).
Moreover, Nodal signals from the epiblast also pattern the visceral
endoderm by activating the SMAD2-dependent pathway required for
specification of anterior identity in overlying epiblast cells. Brennan
et al. (2001) concluded that proximal-distal and subsequent
anterior-posterior polarity of the pregastrulation embryo result from
reciprocal cell-cell interactions between the epiblast and the 2
extraembryonic tissues.

By analyzing mouse mutants lacking left-sided expression of Lefty2
(601877), Meno et al. (2001) observed that Nodal is able to diffuse over
a large distance in the absence of Lefty2. They concluded that Nodal is
a long-range signaling molecule but that its range of action is normally
limited by the feedback inhibitor Lefty2.

Iratni et al. (2002) demonstrated that the transcriptional corepressor
DRAP1 (602289) has a very specific role in regulation of Nodal activity
during mouse embryogenesis. Iratni et al. (2002) found that loss of
DRAP1 leads to severe gastrulation defects that are consistent with
increased expression of Nodal and can be partially suppressed by Nodal
heterozygosity. Biochemical studies indicated that DRAP1 interacts with
and inhibits DNA binding by the winged-helix transcription factor FOXH1
(FAST1; 603621), a critical component of a positive feedback loop for
Nodal activity. Iratni et al. (2002) proposed that DRAP1 limits the
spread of a morphogenetic signal by downmodulating the response to the
Nodal autoregulatory loop.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mohapatra et al. (2009) noted that the NODAL gene contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

The mouse Nodal gene maps to chromosome 10 (Zhou et al., 1993). The
International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the human NODAL
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP stSG2607).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family in which several members had situs ambiguus shown to be due
to mutation in the ZIC3 gene (300265), Gebbia et al. (1997) found a
normal male with a daughter with situs ambiguus; neither the father nor
the daughter carried any mutation in the coding region of ZIC3 and both
parents were anatomically normal. Paternity was confirmed, the mother
was unrelated to the rest of the family, and the daughter had a 46,XX
karyotype. Because observations in mice had suggested that heterozygous
mutations in human NODAL may be associated with human situs
abnormalities, Gebbia et al. (1997) searched for mutations in the NODAL
gene. In the affected daughter and her unaffected mother, they found an
arg183-to-gln substitution (R183Q; 601265.0001) in the prodomain of
NODAL. None of more than 200 control chromosomes carried this
substitution, and no other NODAL mutations were identified in other
members of that family or in any other individual harboring a mutant
ZIC3 allele.

In 14 of 269 patients with either classic heterotaxy or looping
cardiovascular malformations (CVM), Mohapatra et al. (2009) identified 4
different missense variants (see, e.g., 601265.0002), 1 in-frame
insertion/deletion (601265.0003), and 2 conserved splice site variants
(see, e.g., 601265.0004) in the NODAL gene. Although similar with regard
to other associated defects, individuals with the NODAL mutations had a
significantly higher occurrence of pulmonary valve atresia (p = 0.001)
compared with individuals without a detectable NODAL mutation.
Functional analysis demonstrated that the missense variant forms of
NODAL exhibited significant impairment of signaling as measured by
decreased Cripto (TDGF1; 187395) coreceptor-mediated activation of
artificial reporters. Expression of these NODAL proteins also led to
reduced induction of SMAD2 phosphorylation and impaired SMAD2 nuclear
import. Mohapatra et al. (2009) proposed a role for mutations and rare
deleterious variants in NODAL as a cause for sporadic human left-right
patterning defects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Krebs et al. (2003) showed that mouse embryos mutant for the Notch
ligand Dll1 (606582) or doubly mutant for Notch1 (190198) and Notch2
(600275) exhibited multiple defects in left-right asymmetry. Dll1 -/-
embryos did not express Nodal in the region around the node. Analysis of
the enhancer regulating node-specific Nodal expression revealed binding
sites for Rbpj (RBPSUH; 147183). Mutation of these sites destroyed the
ability of the enhancer to direct node-specific gene expression in
transgenic mice. Krebs et al. (2003) concluded that Dll1-mediated Notch
signaling is essential for generation of left-right asymmetry, and that
perinodal expression of Nodal is an essential component of left-right
asymmetry determination in mice.

Using gain- and loss-of-function experiments in zebrafish and mouse,
Raya et al. (2003) showed that activity of the Notch pathway was
necessary and sufficient for Nodal expression around the node and for
proper left-right determination. They also identified critical
Rbpj-binding sequences in the Nodal promoter.

Ware et al. (2006) found that mice compound heterozygous for a Zic3 and
a Nodal mutation had significantly increased lethality compared to
Zic3-null mice. No males and a reduced number of females survived.
Accordingly, the laterality defects observed in compound heterozygous
mice were more severe than in mice with either mutant alone. The
findings indicated that the 2 genes interact in the same pathway.
Further studies indicated that Zic3 activates an upstream enhancer of
Nodal.

Yang et al. (2010) reported that holoprosencephaly (see HPE, 236100) in
mice can result from simultaneous reduction in both Nodal (601265)
signaling and expression levels of the Bmp antagonists chordin (CHRD;
603475) or Noggin (NOG; 602991). HPE defects are the result of reduced
production of tissues that promote forebrain and craniofacial
development. Nodal promotes the expression of genes in the anterior
primitive streak important for the development of these tissues, whereas
Bmp inhibits their expression. Pharmacologic and transgenic manipulation
of these signaling pathways suggested that the Bmp and Nodal pathways
antagonize each other prior to intracellular signal transduction. In
vitro experiments indicated that secreted Bmp2 (112261) and Nodal can
form extracellular complexes, potentially interfering with receptor
activation. Yang et al. (2010) concluded that the patterning of
forebrain and medial craniofacial elements requires a fine balance
between BMP and NODAL signaling during primitive streak development.

Reaction-diffusion models postulated that differences in signaling range
are caused by differential diffusivity of inhibitor and activator. Other
models suggested that differential clearance underlies different
signaling ranges. To test these models, Muller et al. (2012) measured
the biophysical properties of the Nodal/Lefty (see 603037)
activator/inhibitor system during zebrafish embryogenesis. Analysis of
Nodal and Lefty gradients revealed that Nodals have a shorter range than
Lefty proteins. Pulse-labeling analysis indicated that Nodals and Leftys
have similar clearance kinetics, whereas fluorescence recovery assays
revealed that Leftys have a higher effective diffusion coefficient than
Nodals. Muller et al. (2012) concluded that their results indicated that
differential diffusivity is the major determinant of the differences in
Nodal/Lefty range and provided biophysical support for
reaction-diffusion models of activator/inhibitor-mediated patterning.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HETEROTAXY, VISCERAL, 5, AUTOSOMAL
NODAL, ARG183GLN

In a kindred in which several members had X-linked abnormalities of
left-right body axis formation (306955) due to mutation in the ZIC3 gene
(300265), Gebbia et al. (1997) found a normal male who had fathered a
daughter with situs ambiguus (270100). Neither she nor the father
carried any mutation in ZIC3, and both parents were anatomically normal.
The daughter and her unaffected mother who was unrelated to the father
were found to be heterozygous for an arg182-to-gln (R183Q) mutation in
the prodomain of the NODAL gene.

.0002
HETEROTAXY, VISCERAL, 5, AUTOSOMAL
NODAL, GLY260ARG

In 8 of 82 unrelated Hispanic patients with heterotaxy (270100),
Mohapatra et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 778G-A transition in
exon 2 of the NODAL gene, resulting in a gly260-to-arg (G260R)
substitution in a highly conserved residue. Most patients had
d-transposition of the great arteries in addition to other cardiac
anomalies, 3 had abdominal situs inversus, and 2 had asplenia. The
detection of this variant in the unaffected father of 1 patient and 1 of
108 Hispanic controls, suggested incomplete penetrance. None of the 190
Caucasian or African American controls examined carried the variant.
Functional analysis showed reduced NODAL signaling through both
FOXH1-dependent and -independent pathways, as well as reduced SMAD2
phosphorylation and impaired nuclear import.

.0003
HETEROTAXY, VISCERAL, 5, AUTOSOMAL
NODAL, 9-BP INS/24-BP DEL, NT700

In a male Hispanic patient with heterotaxy (270100), Mohapatra et al.
(2009) identified an in-frame 9-bp insertion (700insTTGACTTCC) and 24-bp
deletion (nucleotide 700-723) in exon 2 of the NODAL gene. The patient
had d-transposition of the great arteries, pulmonary atresia, and
double-inlet left ventricle. Parental DNA was not available for testing,
and the mutation was not detected in 298 controls. Functional analysis
showed reduced NODAL signaling through both FOXH1-dependent and
-independent pathways, as well as reduced SMAD2 phosphorylation and
impaired nuclear import.

.0004
HETEROTAXY, VISCERAL, 5, AUTOSOMAL
NODAL, IVS2DS, G-A, +1

In a male Hispanic patient with heterotaxy (270100), Mohapatra et al.
(2009) identified a G-to-A transition (891+1G-A) in the donor splice
site of intron 2 of the NODAL gene, predicted to result in altered
splicing activity. The patient had dextrocardia, levo-transposition of
the great arteries, double-outlet right ventricle, pulmonary valve
stenosis, and a ventricular septal defect. The mutation was not detected
in 298 controls.

606028	TITLE *606028 CLEAVAGE AND POLYADENYLATION SPECIFICITY FACTOR 2; CPSF2
;;CLEAVAGE-POLYADENYLATION SPECIFICITY FACTOR, 100-KD SUBUNIT; CPSF100
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) is a multisubunit
complex that plays a central role in 3-prime processing of pre-mRNAs.
CPSF recognizes the AAUAAA signal in the pre-mRNA and interacts with
other proteins to facilitate both RNA cleavage and poly(A) synthesis
(summary by Murthy and Manley, 1995). The CPSF2 gene encodes the 100-kD
subunit of CPSF.

CLONING

Jenny et al. (1994) cloned a cDNA encoding bovine Cpsf2. Northern blot
analysis using bovine Cpsf2 coding sequences revealed expression of
5.6-, 4.6-, 3.8-, and 3.0-kb transcripts in HeLa cells. Immunoblot
analysis showed expression of a 100-kD nuclear protein in bovine and
human cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression of
both the 100-kD and the 160-kD (CPSF1; 606027) CPSF subunits in
nucleoplasm but not in nucleoli.

Nagase et al. (2000) cloned a partial cDNA encoding 579 amino acids of
human CPSF2, which they called KIAA1367, from a fetal brain cDNA
library. The partial human protein is 99% identical to the 782-amino
acid bovine protein. RT-PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous but variable
expression of CPSF2, with highest levels in liver and testis.

MAPPING

Samiotaki et al. (2000) mapped the CPSF2 gene to 14q31.3 using radiation
hybrid analysis.

188360	TITLE *188360 THYMOCYTE ANTIGEN CD1B; CD1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD1B is a group-1 member of the CD1 family of major histocompatibility
(MHC)-like glycoproteins. See CD1A (188370) for background information
on CD1 molecules.

GENE FUNCTION

Beckman et al. (1994) and Sieling et al. (1995) showed that T cells can
recognize not only peptide antigens presented by classical MHC
molecules, but also virulence-associated mycobacterial lipid antigens
such as mycolic acids and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) derivatives,
respectively, presented to TCRA (see 186880)/TCRB+ (see 186930) CD4-CD8-
T cells by CD1B-bearing antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Sieling et al.
(1995) found that LAM recognition requires internalization and
acidification in the endosomal compartment before presentation on the
APC surface. Examining dermal leprosy (246300) lesions by
immunohistochemistry from patients with the tuberculoid form of the
disease, associated with high specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI),
Sieling et al. (1999) observed strong induction of CD1A, CD1B, and CD1C
(188340) expression. In contrast, lesions from patients with the
lepromatous form, associated with weak or absent M. leprae-specific CMI,
do not express CD1 antigens. Moreover, by 2-color immunofluorescence
analysis, Sieling et al. (1999) demonstrated that the cells expressing
CD1 antigens are CD83+ (604534) dendritic cells, which are also highly
efficient APCs for CD1B-restricted T cells in vitro.

In a review of CD1 lipid antigen presentation, Park and Bendelac (2000)
noted that lipid binding might occur in the secretory pathway, at the
cell surface, or only after internalization in an acidified compartment.
CD1B is located in the late endosome or lysosome. Access to the
endocytic pathway is regulated by a tyrosine-based motif in the
cytoplasmic tail of CD1 that differs among CD1B, CD1C, and CD1D
(188410).

Vincent et al. (2002) showed that group-1 (i.e., CD1A, CD1B, and CD1C)
foreign antigen-nonspecific CD1-restricted T-cell clones could promote
dendritic cell (DC) maturation in the presence of lipopolysaccharide and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570), whereas group-2 (i.e., CD1D)-restricted
T cells failed to induce interleukin-12 p70 (IL12; see 161561)
production and DC maturation except in the presence of CD40 ligand
(CD40LG; 300386). On the other hand, the CD1D-restricted T-cell clones
were more efficient producers of IL10 (124092).

Sugita et al. (2002) showed that CD1B, but not other CD1 isoforms, binds
the AP3 adaptor protein complex (see AP3B1; 603401). In AP3-deficient
cells from patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome-2 (HPS2; 608233),
which is caused by mutations in the AP3B1 gene, CD1B fails to gain
access to lysosomes efficiently and is mislocalized to the plasma
membrane and early endosomes. The failure in CD1B trafficking results in
a profound failure to present microbial lipid antigens efficiently.
Since MHC class II traffics normally in AP3-deficient cells, Sugita et
al. (2002) proposed that defects in CD1B antigen presentation may
account for the recurrent bacterial infections in HPS2 patients. They
concluded that there is an AP3-dependent pathway for antigen
presentation by CD1B molecules.

Winau et al. (2004) transfected PSAP (176801)-deficient dermal
fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts with CD1B. PSAP-deficient fibroblasts
were characterized by a loss of spindle shape and accumulation of
intracellular vesicles typical of lysosomal storage disorders.
PSAP-deficient cells could only function as proficient
antigen-presenting cells for Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipid
antigen-specific T cells in the presence of exogenous SAPC and not in
the presence of SAPA, SAPB, or SAPD. Fluorescence microscopy
demonstrated that lipid antigen, SAPC, and CD1B colocalized in lysosomal
compartments of PSAP-deficient CD1B-transfected fibroblasts. SAPC, and
to a far lesser extent SAPA, were able to extract lipid antigen from
membranes. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analysis showed that SAPC,
but not other SAPs, specifically bound CD1B, but not CD1A, MHC class I,
or MHC class II. Winau et al. (2004) proposed that SAPC exposes lipid
antigens from intralysosomal membranes for loading onto CD1B.

602942	TITLE *602942 ECOTROPIC VIRAL INTEGRATION SITE 5; EVI5
;;NEUROBLASTOMA STAGE 4S GENE; NB4S
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Roberts et al. (1998) cloned the breakpoints of a constitutional
t(1;10)(p22;q21) translocation in a child with stage 4S neuroblastoma
(256700). They identified the gene on chromosome 1 as EVI5, which they
called NB4S, and obtained a full-length NB4S cDNA by database analysis,
screening a liver cDNA library, and 5-prime RACE of adult brain total
RNA. The deduced 810-amino acid protein shares 88% identity with mouse
Evi5. A 200-amino acid region of NB4S shares significant homology with
TBC1 box motif proteins (see 609850) involved in cell growth and
differentiation. The C-terminal end of the protein contains a number of
coiled-coil domains, indicating a possible protein-protein binding
function. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb transcript in a wide
variety of tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) inhibitor EMI1 (FBXO5;
606013) controls progression to S phase and mitosis by stabilizing key
APC/C ubiquitination substrates, including cyclin A (CCNA2; 123835).
Eldridge et al. (2006) found that endogenous EVI5 and EMI1
coprecipitated from human embryonic kidney cell lysates and that the
recombinant proteins interacted in vitro. Each protein bound the other
through its N terminus. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized EVI5
predominantly to centrosomes in interphase human osteosarcoma cells, and
centrosomal localization required the C-terminal half of EVI5. In
synchronized HeLa cells, EVI5 accumulated in early G1 phase, reached
maximal level by late G1, and decreased in early mitosis concomitantly
with EMI1 in a ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent manner. Degradation
of EVI5 in early mitosis required phosphorylation of EVI5 by PLK1
(602098). In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that EVI5 stabilized
EMI1 during interphase by binding to a site adjacent to the EMI1 degron
and blocking both PLK-dependent degron phosphorylation and subsequent
BTRC (603482) binding. By doing so, EVI5 antagonized ubiquitin-dependent
destruction of EMI1 by the BTRC-containing SCF complex. Ablation of EVI5
by small interfering RNA caused precocious degradation of EMI1,
premature APC/C activation, cyclin destruction, cell cycle arrest,
centrosome overduplication, and mitotic catastrophe. Eldridge et al.
(2006) concluded that EVI5 serves as a critical regulator of cell cycle
progression by defining a window of stability for EMI1 during interphase
analogous to the window of stability provided by EMI1 for APC/C
substrates over a similar period.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Roberts et al. (1998) mapped the EVI5 gene
to chromosome 1p22.

CYTOGENETICS

Roberts et al. (1998) cloned the breakpoints of a constitutional
t(1;10)(p22;q21) translocation in a child with stage 4S neuroblastoma.
The chromosome 1 breakpoint interrupted NB4S, and the chromosome 10
breakpoint interrupted a novel transcript, called TRNG10, that could
only be detected in tumor cells. This transcript has no exon/intron
structure or significant open reading frame, suggesting that it is a
structural RNA that is transcribed but not translated. The chromosome
rearrangement created a fusion gene product that combined the TBC1 motif
of NB4S with a polyadenylation signal from TRNG10, potentially
generating a truncated protein with oncogenic properties.

605759	TITLE *605759 ANKYRIN REPEAT- AND SOCS BOX-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; ASB2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins of the ASB family, such as ASB2, contain central tandem ankyrin
(see 612641) repeats and a C-terminal suppressor of cytokine signaling
(SOCS) box. SOCS box proteins are predicted to be involved in protein
degradation by acting as a bridge between substrate proteins and E3
ubiquitin protein ligases (see 601623) (review by Kile et al., 2002).

CLONING

By EST database searching, probing a mouse spleen cDNA library, and
further database searching, Kile et al. (2000) identified a cDNA
encoding ASB2. Sequence analysis predicted that the 544-amino acid
protein, which is 94% identical to the mouse protein, contains 15
ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal SOCS box. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues revealed wide expression of a 2.6-kb transcript, with
highest expression in muscle, heart, and spleen.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kile et al. (2000) determined that the ASB2 gene contains at least 10
exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ASB2 gene to chromosome 14q32.12 based on an
alignment of the ASB2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK A056723) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Kile et al. (2000) mapped the mouse gene between the markers D12Mit99
and D12Mit278.

GENE FUNCTION

Kohroki et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged ASB2 and several other
ASB family members interacted with endogenous CUL5 (601741) and RBX2
(RNF7; 603863) in immunoprecipitated HEK293 cells. The ASB proteins did
not interact with CUL2 (603135) or RBX1 (603814). ASB2-CUL5-RBX2
complexes showed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro.

605625	TITLE *605625 MYELOMA OVEREXPRESSED GENE; MYEOV
DESCRIPTION Translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH; see
147100) at 14q32.3 are mediated by errors during VDJ recombination
either early in development or during class-switch recombination at
later stages in B-cell development. Such translocations occur in as many
as 70% of multiple myelomas and plasma cell leukemias. See 254500.

By cloning gastric carcinoma tumor DNA into phage vectors, probing with
human Alu repetitive sequences, and exon-trap analysis, Janssen et al.
(2000) isolated a cDNA encoding MYEOV (myeloma overexpressed gene).
Sequence analysis predicted that the 313-amino acid protein contains no
known functional motifs except for an RNP1 motif typical of RNA-binding
proteins and a leucine-isoleucine tail similar to cytoplasmically
exposed membrane proteins with a C-terminal membrane anchor. Northern
blot analysis detected a major 2.8-kb and a minor 3.5-kb transcript in
various tumor cell lines. In 3 of 7 multiple myeloma cell lines with a
t(11;14)(q13;q32) and cyclin D1 (CCND1; 168461) overexpression, Northern
blot analysis determined that MYEOV was overexpressed. In all 7 cell
lines, the breakpoint was mapped to the 360-kb region between the 2
genes. MYEOV overexpression was associated with the juxtaposition of an
enhancer to the MYEOV gene.

Using FISH, Janssen et al. (2000) mapped the MYEOV gene to 11q13.1, 360
kb centromeric to CCND1.

DNA amplifications at 11q13 are frequently observed in esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (133239) and correlate with a malignant
phenotype. Although this amplicon spans a region of several megabases
and harbors numerous genes, CCND1 and EMS1 (164765) are thought to be
the relevant candidates in esophageal carcinoma. Janssen et al. (2002)
investigated whether the putative transforming gene MYEOV, mapping 360
kb centromeric to CCND1 and activated concomitantly with CCND1 in a
subset of t(11;14)(q13;q32) positive multiple myeloma cell lines,
represents a target of 11q13 amplification in esophageal carcinoma. They
tested 31 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and 48 primary
tumors for copy number levels of MYEOV and demonstrated that MYEOV was
always coamplified with CCND1. However, its activation was sometimes
inhibited by an epigenetic mechanism.

611282	TITLE *611282 DYNAMIN-BINDING PROTEIN; DNMBP
;;TUBA;;
KIAA1010
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNMBP belongs to the DBL (311030) family of guanine nucleotide exchange
factors and plays a role in the regulation of cell junctions (Otani et
al., 2006).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned DNMBP, which they designated
KIAA1010. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
UTR, and the deduced protein contains motifs suggesting it is a guanine
nucleotide regulatory protein. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression
in ovary, testis, liver, and lung and low expression in all other
tissues examined. Expression was low in all specific brain regions
examined and moderate in spinal cord.

Using the partial KIAA1010 sequence for 5-prime RACE of muscle and brain
cDNA libraries, Salazar et al. (2003) obtained a full-length cDNA
encoding DNMBP, which they called Tuba, in line with the tradition of
naming large synaptic proteins after musical instruments. The deduced
1,577-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 178 kD. It
has 4 N-terminal SH3 domains, followed by a proline-rich region, a
coiled-coil domain, a DBL homology (DH) domain, a BIN (see 601248)/
amphiphysin (see 600418)/Rvs (BAR) domain, and 2 C-terminal SH3 domains.
Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of 7.3- and 6.0-kb
transcripts in all tissues examined. Mouse tissues expressed an
additional smaller transcript. Immunohistochemical analysis of rat brain
cryosections revealed colocalization of Dnmbp with synaptic markers in
neuronal perikarya and dendrites. In addition, Dnmbp localized with the
Golgi complex in neuronal cell bodies.

GENE FUNCTION

Salazar et al. (2003) found that the isolated N-terminal SH3 domains of
Tuba interacted with dynamin-1 (DNM1; 602377) in rat brain extracts and
Chinese hamster ovary cells. The C-terminal SH3 domain of Tuba bound a
variety of actin regulatory proteins, including N-Wasp (WASL; 605056),
Wire (WIPF2; 609692), Wave1 (WASF1; 605035), and Mena (ENAH; 609061), in
rat brain extracts, and it promoted F-actin (see 102610) recruitment in
a mouse neuronal cell line. The isolated DH domain of Tuba showed
concentration-dependent guanyl nucleotide exchange activity with Cdc42
(116952), but not with Rho (ARHA; 165390) or Rac (602048).

Otani et al. (2006) showed that Tuba concentrated at the apical-most
region of cell junctions in a human colon carcinoma cell line via its
interaction with ZO1 (TJP1; 601009). RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated
depletion of Tuba altered the geometric configuration of cell junctions,
resulting in a curved and slack appearance. At the subcellular level,
Tuba inactivation modified the assembly of junctional F-actin and
E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090). Tuba RNAi also retarded cell junction
formation in calcium-switch experiments. Suppression of CDC42 activity
or depletion of N-WASP, an effector of CDC42, mimicked the effect of
Tuba depletion. Conversely, overexpression of dominant-active CDC42 or
N-WASP enhanced junction formation in Tuba-depleted cells. Otani et al.
(2006) concluded that Tuba controls the shaping of cell junctions
through local activation of CDC42 and its effectors.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the DNMBP gene
to chromosome 10. Salazar et al. (2003) stated that the mouse Dnmbp gene
maps to chromosome 19.

606160	TITLE *606160 PANTOTHENATE KINASE 1; PANK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pantothenate kinase (EC 2.7.2.33) is an essential regulatory enzyme in
CoA biosynthesis, catalyzing the cytosolic phosphorylation of
pantothenate (vitamin B5), N-pantothenoylcysteine, and pantetheine. CoA
is the major acyl carrier, playing a central role in intermediary and
fatty acid metabolism. In both yeast and fly, each with only 1
pantothenate kinase gene, the null mutant is inviable (summary by Zhou
et al., 2001).

CLONING

Karim et al. (2000) cloned and sequenced 3 human cDNAs that encode the
alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms of PANK1, which have distinct amino
termini and are predicted to arise from alternative splicing of
transcripts of the same gene. The alpha, beta, and gamma proteins
contain 598, 373, and 400 amino acids, respectively, and share a common
C terminus of 40 kD. Northern blot analysis detected expression of PANK1
in all tissues examined, but predominantly in liver and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Karim et al. (2000) determined that the PANK1 gene contains 9 exons and
spans about 62 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Karim et al. (2000) mapped the
PANK1 gene to chromosome 10q23.2-q23.31. They mapped the mouse Pank1
gene to a region of syntenic homology on chromosome 19C2-3.

612257	TITLE *612257 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED SERINE/THREONINE KINASE 2; MAST2
;;MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED SERINE/THREONINE KINASE, 205-KD; MAST205;;
KIAA0807
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned MAST2, which they designated
KIAA0807. The deduced 1,265-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with mouse Mast205. RT-PCR ELISA detected variable MAST2
expression in all tissues examined.

Walden and Cowan (1993) cloned mouse Mast205 from a testis cDNA library.
The deduced 1,734-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
190.5 kD. It had an apparent molecular mass of 205 kD by SDS-PAGE.
Mast205 contains a central serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain,
which includes an ATP-binding consensus sequence, and several potential
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected
Mast205 expression only in testis. Mast205 expression increased during
postnatal testicular development coincident with meiosis/spermiogenesis.
Immunofluorescence microscopy showed Mast205 associated with mouse
spermatid manchette.

GENE FUNCTION

Walden and Cowan (1993) confirmed that mouse Mast205 had
serine/threonine kinase activity, but not tyrosine kinase activity.
Mouse Mast205 associated with bovine microtubules in vitro. Mutation
analysis revealed that the kinase domain and a more C-terminal domain of
Mast205 were required interaction with microtubules; however, the
interaction was indirect and required other microtubule-associated
proteins.

Valiente et al. (2005) showed that the C-terminal tail of human PTEN
(601728) bound to the PDZ domains of rat Magi2 (606382), Magi3, and Dlg
(DLG1; 601014), mouse Sast (MAST1; 612256) and Mast205, and human MAST3
(612258). Interaction of PTEN with Magi2 increased PTEN protein
stability, and interaction of PTEN with the MAST kinases facilitated
phosphorylation of PTEN by these kinases.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the MAST1 gene
to chromosome 1.

;;LIFEGUARD; LFG;;
NEUROMEMBRANE PROTEIN 35; NMP35
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is used in a number of biologic
processes from modeling the embryo and regulating the immune system to
tumor regression. Conversely, dysfunction of this system has been
implicated in oncogenesis, development of autoimmunity, and degenerative
diseases. Intense study of this process identified membrane-bound
receptors and their cognate ligands that together begin the program that
ultimately leads to cell death. The FAS receptor, also called CD95 or
Apo1, is one such receptor, of which the gene is designated TNFRSF6
(134637) to indicate that it is a member of the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) receptor superfamily. The apoptotic signal must itself be tightly
controlled to avoid inappropriate cell death. Somia et al. (1999)
established a genetic screen to search for molecules that inhibit the
apoptotic signal from the FAS receptor. They isolated a gene, called LFG
('lifeguard'), and found that it is the human homolog of a rat protein,
neuromembrane protein-35 (NMP35), described by Schweitzer et al. (1998).
The LFG open reading frame encodes a 316-amino acid protein predicted by
hydropathy plots to contain 7 membrane-spanning domains. They found that
LFG protects cells uniquely from FAS but not from the mechanistically
related tumor necrosis factor-alpha (191160) death signal. LFG is widely
distributed, but remarkably is highly expressed in the hippocampus. LFG
can bind to the FAS receptor, but does not regulate FAS expression or
interfere with binding of an agonist antibody. Furthermore, LFG does not
inhibit binding of FADD (602457) to FAS.

MAPPING

Somia et al. (1999) used a human/rodent somatic hybrid panel to map the
LFG gene to chromosome 12. This localization was confirmed by
fluorescence in situ hybridization, with a subchromosomal location of
12q13.

179514	TITLE *179514 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB5B; RAB5B
DESCRIPTION A number of processes in eukaryotic cells are believed to be regulated
by small, monomeric GTPases belonging to the RAS superfamily. A subset
of these GTPases (the yeast YPTI/SEC4 gene products and their mammalian
counterparts, the RAB proteins) plays a central role in membrane
trafficking. Each of the several proteins of this subfamily that have
been identified is thought to regulate vesicular trafficking at a
specific subcellular compartment. The subcellular location of several
RAB proteins has been determined by immunohistochemical methods. For
example, RAB2 (179509) is found in the intermediate recycling pathway
between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. RAB6 (179513)
is distributed in the medial and trans Golgi. RAB4 (179511) and RAB5A
(179512) are associated with the plasma membrane and early endosomes.
Wilson and Wilson (1992) cloned cDNA of a novel member of the RAB family
by screening a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library with
oligonucleotide probes corresponding to a region conserved in all RAB
proteins. The newly identified RAB protein was 81% identical to human
RAB5, the canine counterpart of which had been localized to the plasma
membrane and early endosomes. In light of this homology, Wilson and
Wilson (1992) called the new member of the GTPase superfamily RAB5B. It
is presumably involved in vesicular trafficking at the plasma membrane.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Korenberg et al. (1995) mapped
the RAB5B gene to 12q13.

;;REQUIEM, APOPTOSIS RESPONSE ZINC FINGER GENE; REQ;;
UBI-D4/REQUIEM HOMOLOG; UBID4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chestkov et al. (1996) described a conserved human gene homologous to
Neuro-d4 (DPF1; 601670) that they designated Ubi-d4. The human protein
is the apparent homolog of the mouse Ubi-d4 protein, also known as
Requiem (Gabig et al., 1994).

Apoptosis in murine myeloid cell lines requires expression of the
Requiem gene, which encodes a putative zinc finger protein. A large
consortium (Gabig et al., 1998) consisting of 3 groups detected the
protein in both cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular fractions of murine
myeloid cells and human K562 leukemia cells, suggesting that the protein
may have a function distinct from that of a transcription factor. The
distribution did not alter upon apoptosis induction by IL3 deprivation.
The gene was expressed in various tissues in early gestational ages;
however, expression was confined to testis, spleen, thymus, and part of
the hippocampus in the adult mouse. The expression profile was
considered consistent with a functional role during rapid growth and
cell turnover, and again suggested a regulatory function for
hematopoietic cells. The nucleotide sequence of the human cDNA is 73%
identical overall to that of the murine cDNA. The human sequence encodes
a 391-amino acid protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Expression of Ubi-d4/requiem appeared to be required for apoptosis
(Chestkov et al., 1996; Gabig et al., 1994).

MAPPING

Chestkov et al. (1996) mapped the DPF2 gene to chromosome 11q13 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By cohybridization fluorescence in situ hybridization on extended DNA
fibers, Gabig et al. (1998) mapped the REQ gene between MLK3 (600050)
and FAU (134690), which had been mapped to 11q13, telomeric to PYGM
(608455). The physical distance between MLK3 and REQ was estimated to be
150 kb.

610366	TITLE *610366 ADAPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN COMPLEX 3, MU-1 SUBUNIT; AP3M1
;;CLATHRIN ADAPTOR COMPLEX AP3, MU-3A SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AP3M1 is a subunit of the AP3 complex that functions in cargo-selective
transport of proteins from the Golgi to the lysosome. Other subunits of
this complex are beta-3 (see AP3B1; 603401), AP3D1 (607246), and sigma-3
(see AP3S1; 601507) (Odorizzi et al., 1998).

CLONING

Pevsner et al. (1994) cloned rat Ap3m1, which encodes a 47-kD protein
with about 80% amino acid identity to Ap3m2 (610469) and about 30% amino
acid identity to mouse mu-1 (see AP1M1; 603535) and rat mu-2 (AP2M1;
601024). Ap3m1 was expressed in all rat tissues examined, including
brain heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, and spinal cord.

GENE FUNCTION

Dell'Angelica et al. (1999) found that the mu-3A subunit of AP3
interacts with tyrosine-based lysosome targeting signals in cargo
proteins and thereby assists in their targeting from the Golgi to
lysosomes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AP3M1
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-11846).

609931	TITLE *609931 MYOSIN LIGHT CHAIN 6, ALKALI, SMOOTH MUSCLE AND NONMUSCLE; MYL6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Myosin is composed of heavy chain (MHC; see 160730) and light chain
(MLC) subunits. Alkaline MLCs, such as MYL6, dissociate from MHCs at
high pH. MYL6 encodes both smooth muscle and nonmuscle MLC isoforms
(Hailstones and Gunning, 1990).

CLONING

By screening a genomic library with a chicken Mlc and a partial clone of
MYL1 (160780), followed by screening lymphoblast and smooth muscle cDNA
libraries, Lenz et al. (1989) cloned 2 MYL6 variants generated by
alternative splicing of exon 6. They designated the nonmuscle variant
LYM4 and the smooth muscle variant GT6. Both deduced proteins contain
151 amino acids and differ at only 5 C-terminal amino acids. The GT6
transcript also has a longer 3-prime UTR. Northern blot analysis
detected a 0.7-kb LYM4 transcript in both HeLa cells and human uterus
smooth muscle, whereas a GT6 transcript of similar size was detected in
uterus smooth muscle only.

By screening a transformed human fibroblast cDNA library with MLC1SA
(609930), followed by RT-PCR of human colon RNA, Hailstones and Gunning
(1990) cloned the nonmuscle and smooth muscle variants of MYL6, which
they designated MLC3NM and MLC3SM, respectively. Both deduced proteins
contain 151 amino acids and differ from other MLCs in that they lack
highly basic amino aids in their N termini. MLC3NM has a calculated
molecular mass of 16.9 kD, whereas MLC3SM has a calculated molecular
mass of 17 kD. Expression of MYL6 was highest in fibroblasts and
myoblasts, lower in fetal muscle, and lowest in adult muscle.

Using glutathione S-transferase-3 (GSTP1; 134660) as probe of a retina
cDNA library, Bora et al. (1994) cloned an MYL6 splice variant that they
designated ESMLC. The deduced 157-amino acid ESMLC protein is identical
to GT6 (Lenz et al., 1989) except that it contains additional N-terminal
amino acids. The nucleotide sequence of GSTP1 and ESMLC are 54%
identical, but the deduced proteins are only 11% identical. PCR analysis
detected ESMLC expression in eye, aorta, and heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lenz et al. (1989) determined that the MYL6 gene contains 7 exons. Exon
1 encodes only the first methionine and the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MYL6
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP WI-18807).

611806	TITLE *611806 ARSENIC (+3 OXIDATION STATE) METHYLTRANSFERASE; AS3MT
;;S-ADENOSYL-L-METHIONINE:ARSENIC(III) METHYLTRANSFERASE;;
CYT19
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AS3MT catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from
S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to trivalent arsenical and may play a
role in arsenic metabolism (Lin et al., 2002).

CLONING

By mass spectrometry of rat As3mt purified from rat liver cytosol,
followed by database analysis, Lin et al. (2002) identified human AS3MT.
By PCR of an adult rat liver cDNA library, they cloned rat As3mt. The
deduced 369-amino acid rat protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 41 kD and contains 2 methyltransferase motifs. RT-PCR analysis of
adult rat tissues detected expression in heart, adrenal, urinary
bladder, brain, kidney, lung, and liver. Human AS3MT was expressed in a
hepatoma cell line but not in an immortalized human urothelial cell
line. Recombinant rat As3mt catalyzed the transfer of methyl groups from
AdoMet to trivalent arsenicals, resulting in methylated and dimethylated
arsenicals.

By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE PCR of a human liver cDNA library, Wood et
al. (2006) cloned AS3MT, which encodes a 375-amino acid protein with 76%
amino acid identity to rat As3mt.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wood et al. (2006) determined that the AS3MT gene contains 11 exons and
spans 32 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wood et al. (2006) mapped the AS3MT gene
to chromosome 10q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By sequencing the AS3MT gene in 60 African American and 60 Caucasian
American samples, Wood et al. (2006) identified 26 SNPs, including 3
nonsynonymous SNPs and a VNTR in the 5-prime untranslated region. In
transfected COS-1 cells, a met287-to-thr (M287T)-containing allozyme
showed increased enzyme activity compared to wildtype.

Among 207 Chilean men working in the copper industry and exposed to
arsenic, Hernandez et al. (2008) observed an associated between urinary
arsenic metabolite levels and the M287T SNP in the AS3MT gene, The
thr287 variant occurred at a frequency of 0.09. Individuals carrying the
variant allele presented a 4.63% higher level of arsenic metabolites in
urine than carriers of the wildtype allele (p = 0.0007). When the
population was divided into 2 groups according to the level of arsenic
exposure, a significant increase was found only in the higher exposed
group, where individuals carrying the variant allele presented a 4.79%
higher level of urinary MMA compared to wildtype allele carriers (p =
0.0010). Hernandez et al. (2008) concluded that individuals with the
thr287 variant have increased arsenic methylation and thus may be at an
increased risk for the toxic and genotoxic effects of arsenic exposure,
if, as the classical arsenic metabolic pathway indicates, methylation
enhances toxicity.

114110	TITLE *114110 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A6; S100A6
;;CALCYCLIN; CACY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

S100 proteins, such as S100A6, are small, acidic Ca(2+)-binding proteins
that transduce Ca(2+)-signals via interaction with intracellular target
proteins (Mandinova et al., 1998).

CLONING

Ferrari et al. (1987) noted that S100A6, which they called calcyclin,
was originally defined as a cDNA clone (2A9) whose cognate RNA was found
to be growth-regulated and whose sequence showed strong similarities to
that of the S100 protein (see S100A1; 176940) and to a subunit of the
major cellular substrate for tyrosine kinase.

Using Northern blot analysis, Engelkamp et al. (1992) found ubiquitous
expression of a CACY transcript of about 550 bp. Highest expression was
detected in kidney, lung, and thymus.

Using immunofluorescence analysis and confocal laser scanning
microscopy, Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that S100A1, S100A2 (176993),
S100A4 (114210), and S100A6 localized to distinct intracellular
compartments in cultured human vascular and intestinal smooth muscle
cells. S100A6 localized predominantly with the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

GENE FUNCTION

Mandinova et al. (1998) showed that elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) led to
relocalization of S100A1, S100A4, and S100A6 from sarcoplasmic reticulum
to vesicle-like structures around the nucleus in human vascular smooth
muscle cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using a full-length cDNA, Ferrari et al. (1987) isolated the entire
calcyclin gene plus extensive flanking sequences. They found that the
calcyclin gene is present in single copy and has 3 exons. The 5-prime
flanking sequence contains a TATA box, GC boxes, and a sequence with a
strong homology to the enhancer core of the SV40 promoter. Other
enhancer-like elements are scattered in both the 5-prime and 3-prime
flanking regions.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Ferrari et al. (1987) determined that the CACY
gene maps to chromosome 1q21-q25. Using cDNA probes for CACY, van
Heyningen et al. (1989) and Dorin et al. (1990) showed that the CACY
gene cosegregates with CAGA (S100A8; 123885) and CAGB (S100A9; 123886),
which are located on chromosome 1q12-q21. In the course of constructing
a physical map of human 1q21-q23, Oakey et al. (1992) determined that
the CACY gene is located at the centromeric end of that segment,
proximal to SPTA1 (182860).

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC from chromosome 1q21 on which 9
different genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be
localized. The clustered organization of S100 genes allowed introduction
of a new logical nomenclature based on their physical arrangement on the
chromosome with S100A1 being closest to the telomere and S100A9 being
closest to the centromere. In the new nomenclature, CACY became S100A6.

By linkage studies of interspecific backcrosses of Mus spretus and Mus
musculus domesticus, Seldin (1989) demonstrated that the Cacy gene is
located on mouse chromosome 3.

171490	TITLE *171490 PHOSDUCIN; PDC
DESCRIPTION Pinealocytes of the pineal gland and photoreceptors of the retina are
embryologically related. In lower vertebrates, the pinealocytes possess
the structure and light sensitivity of retinal photoreceptors; however,
in mammalian pineals, pinealocytes have become shielded from light by
the cranium and have developed an alternative neuroendocrine function
(Reiter, 1981). Rat pinealocytes, like those of other mammals, exhibit
circadian rhythms of activity that are entrained by light through a
circuitous neural pathway, extending from the retina to the hypothalamus
and returning to the pineal via sympathetic nerves of the peripheral
nervous system. The pineal gland contains a soluble phosphoprotein,
phosducin, which is homologous in solubility and primary amino acid
structure to retinal phosducin. Phosducin has been shown to bind the
beta and gamma subunits of the retinal G-protein transducin. Lee et al.
(1990) sequenced the bovine retinal phosducin. Craft et al. (1991) used
the bovine retinal phosducin mRNA to isolate cDNA for this gene from a
rat pineal library. The cDNA was used to map the phosducin gene in the
mouse. By the study of interspecific crosses, Craft et al. (1991) found
that the phosducin gene is located within a region of mouse chromosome 1
that shows homology of synteny with a region of human 1q. Ding et al.
(1993) proved the prediction by homology by mapping the human PDC gene
to chromosome 1 by somatic cell hybridization and by regionalizing the
assignment to 1q25-q31.1 by in situ hybridization. Using both
human/mouse somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization to metaphase
chromosomes, Sparkes et al. (1993) mapped the human PDC gene to
chromosome 1q25-q32.1. PDC is a potential candidate gene for retinitis
pigmentosa. Abe et al. (1994) showed that the PDC gene is 18 kb long and
has 4 exons. The sequences of the human and mouse phosducin genes were
highly homologous.

CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 137; C14ORF137
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Otubains are deubiquitylating cysteine proteases (DUBs; see 602519) that
belong to the ovarian tumor (OTU) protein superfamily. Like other DUBs,
otubains cleave proteins precisely at the ubiquitin (UB; see
191339)-protein bond.

CLONING

By affinity purification of DUBs from HeLa cells using UB aldehyde
(UBAL), followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrophotometric analysis,
Balakirev et al. (2003) obtained cDNAs encoding OTB1 (608337) and OTB2.
The 234-amino acid, 27-kD OTB1 protein contains UB-interaction motifs
(UIMs) and UB-associated (UBA) domains, as well as putative nuclear
localization signals and a consensus LxxLL motif. RT-PCR and Western
blot analyses revealed wide expression of OTB2, with highest expression
in brain.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Balakirev et al. (2003) mapped the OTUB2
gene to chromosome 14q32.12.

611202	TITLE *611202 N-ACYLSPHINGOSINE AMIDOHYDROLASE 2; ASAH2
;;CERAMIDASE, NONLYSOSOMAL;;
NONLYSOSOMAL CERAMIDASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ceramidases (EC 3.5.1.23), such as ASAH2, catalyze hydrolysis of the
N-acyl linkage of ceramide, a second messenger in a variety of cellular
events, to produce sphingosine. Sphingosine exerts both mitogenic and
apoptosis-inducing activities, and its phosphorylated form functions as
an intra- and intercellular second messenger (see 603730) (Mitsutake et
al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to rat brain ceramidase,
followed by PCR and RACE of a kidney cDNA library, El Bawab et al.
(2000) cloned ASAH2, which they called CDase. The deduced 761-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 84 kD. It contains a signal
peptide, a mitochondrial targeting sequence, 4 transmembrane domains, a
myristoylation site, phosphorylation sites, and N-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of a major 3.5-kb
transcript, with highest levels in kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart.
Minor transcripts of 2.4, 3.1, and 7 kb were expressed in some tissues.
Fluorescence-tagged ASAH2 colocalized with a mitochondrial marker in
transfected human cell lines. Western blot analysis detected
fluorescence-tagged ASAH2 at 123 kD, suggesting that the mass of ASAH2
alone is 96 kD.

Avramopoulos et al. (2007) identified ASAH2L (ASAH2C; 610987), a partial
duplication of the ASAH2 gene inserted downstream from promoter
sequences on chromosome 10. Northern blot analysis using probes common
to both ASAH2 and ASAH2L and specific to ASAH2 suggested that ASAH2 was
expressed in colon only. The major ASAH2 transcript was 5.3 kb, and
minor transcripts of 1.5 and 2.5 kb were also detected. RT-PCR showed
highest ASAH2 expression in colon and small intestine, with weaker
expression in kidney and testis. Avramopoulos et al. (2007) concluded
that the ubiquitously expressed 3.5-kb transcript reported by El Bawab
et al. (2000) corresponded to ASAH2L, not ASAH2.

Mitsutake et al. (2001) cloned rat Asah2, which encodes a protein 76%
identical to human ASAH2. They noted that mouse and rat Asah2 lack the
mitochondrial localization signal found in human ASAH2, but they have an
endoplasmic reticulum transitional signal and a lysosome/late endosome
sorting signal not found in the human protein. The rat protein localized
at apical membranes of rat kidney tubules and was enriched in raft
microdomains with cholesterol and GM1 ganglioside. In rat liver, Asah2
distributed with endosome-like organelles in hepatocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

El Bawab et al. (2000) found that ASAH2 catalyzed hydrolysis of ceramide
with a pH optimum between pH 7.5 and 9.5 in transfected human embryonic
kidney cells. ASAH2 activity was independent of EDTA, Mg(2+), and
Ca(2+), but it was inhibited by the reducing agent dithiolthreitol.

GENE STRUCTURE

Avramopoulos et al. (2007) determined that the ASAH2 gene contains 20
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Avramopoulos et al. (2007) mapped the
ASAH2 gene to chromosome 10q11.23.

605210	TITLE *605210 DISRUPTED IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 1; DISC1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DISC1 regulates multiple aspects of embryonic and adult neurogenesis
(Kim et al., 2009).

CLONING

Millar et al. (2000) isolated and sequenced a translocation breakpoint
region on chromosome 1q42 that had been identified by St. Clair et al.
(1990) in a large Scottish family with mental and/or behavioral
disorders, including schizophrenia (see 604906), schizoaffective
disorder, recurrent major depression, and adolescent conduct and
emotional disorders. Within the 1q42 chromosomal region, Millar et al.
(2000) identified 2 novel genes directly disrupted by the translocation,
which the authors termed 'disrupted in schizophrenia' 1 and 2 (DISC1 and
DISC2, 606271). The major DISC1 gene is predicted to encode an 854-amino
acid protein containing a globular N-terminal domain and a helical
C-terminal domain with the potential to form a coiled-coil by
interaction with another protein(s). Northern blot analysis identified a
7.5-kb mRNA transcript with ubiquitous expression. DISC2 apparently
specifies a single exon thought to be a noncoding RNA molecule that is
antisense to DISC1, an arrangement that has been observed at other loci
where the antisense RNA may regulate expression of the sense gene.
Millar et al. (2000) suggested that DISC1 and DISC2 may confer
susceptibility to psychiatric illnesses.

Ma et al. (2002) cloned and characterized mouse Disc1, which encodes an
851-amino acid protein that shares 56% sequence identity with the human
protein. Both the mouse and human genes show conservation of leucine
zipper and coiled-coil domains. In situ hybridization in adult mouse
brain showed a restricted expression pattern, with highest levels in the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and lower expression in CA1-CA3 of the
hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulbs. Ozeki et
al. (2003) cloned and characterized mouse and rat Disc1.

Using Western blot analysis of human brain tissue and cultured human
cell lines, Sawamura et al. (2005) found that the DISC1 protein was
expressed as 2 distinct bands of 95 to 100 kD and 75 to 85 kD.
Subcellular fractionation showed that the 95- to 100-kD isoform was
enriched in the cytoplasm, whereas the 75- to 85-kD isoform was present
in both the nucleus and cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Ozeki et al. (2003) demonstrated that rodent Disc1 expression displayed
pronounced developmental regulation, with the highest levels in late
embryonic life during development of the cerebral cortex. In a yeast
2-hybrid assay of a human whole brain cDNA library, DISC1 interacted
with a variety of cytoskeletal proteins. One of these, NUDEL (NDEL1;
607538), is associated with cortical development and is linked to LIS1
(601545). A schizophrenia-associated DISC1 mutant with a C-terminal
257-residue truncation did not bind NUDEL. Expression of mutant DISC1,
but not wildtype DISC1, reduced neurite extension in rat adrenal
pheochromocytoma cells.

Using yeast 2-hybrid, mammalian 2-hybrid, and coimmunoprecipitation
assays, Morris et al. (2003) showed that DISC1 interacts with multiple
proteins of the centrosome and cytoskeletal system, including MIPT3
(607380), MAP1A (600178), and NUDEL; proteins that localize receptors to
membranes, including alpha-actinin-2 (ACTN2; 102573) and beta-4-spectrin
(SPTBN4; 606214); and proteins that transduce signals from membrane
receptors, including ATF4 (604064) and ATF5 (606398). Truncated mutant
DISC1 failed to interact with ATF4, ATF5, or NUDEL. Deletion mapping
demonstrated that DISC1 has distinct interaction domains: MAP1A
interacts via its LC2 domain with the N terminus of DISC1, whereas MIPT3
and NUDEL bind via their C-terminal domains to the central coiled-coil
domain of DISC1, and ATF4/5 bind via their C-terminal domains to the C
terminus of DISC1. In its full-length form, the DISC1 protein localized
to predominantly perinuclear punctate structures which extended into
neurites in some cells; mutant truncated DISC1, by contrast, was seen in
a diffuse pattern throughout the cytoplasm and abundantly in neurites.
Both forms colocalized with the centrosomal complex, although truncated
less abundantly than full-length DISC1. Although both full-length and
mutant DISC1 were found in microtubule fractions, neither form appeared
to bind directly to microtubules, but rather did so in a MIPT3-dependent
fashion that was stabilized by taxol. Morris et al. (2003) concluded
that DISC1 is a multifunctional protein whose truncation may contribute
to schizophrenia susceptibility by disrupting intracellular transport,
neurite architecture, and/or neuronal migration.

Millar et al. (2005) showed that DISC1 interacts with the UCR2 domain of
phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B; 600127), implicated in susceptibility to
schizophrenia, and that elevation of cellular cAMP leads to dissociation
of PDE4B from DISC1 and in increase in PDE4B activity. The
phosphodiesterases inactivate cAMP, a second messenger implicated in
learning, memory, and mood. Millar et al. (2005) proposed a mechanistic
model whereby DISC1 sequesters PDE4B in resting cells and releases it in
an activated state in response to elevated cAMP.

Kamiya et al. (2005) identified Disc1 as a component of the
microtubule-associated dynein motor complex in rat PC12 neural precursor
cells. Disc1 was essential for maintaining the motor complex at the
centrosome. A schizophrenia-associated C-terminally truncated Disc1
mutant functioned in a dominant-negative manner by interacting with and
redistributing wildtype Disc1 and by disassociating the Disc1-dynein
complex from the centrosome. Depletion of endogenous Disc1 by RNA
interference or expression of truncated Disc1 impaired neurite outgrowth
in PC12 cells in vitro. In embryonic mice, Disc1 RNA interference led to
impaired cerebral cortex development. Kamiya et al. (2005) concluded
that loss of normal DISC1 function during cerebral cortex development
may underlie neurodevelopmental dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Sawamura et al. (2005) analyzed the 75- to 85-kD isoform of DISC1 in
postmortem orbitofrontal cortex from 3 groups of 15 individuals with
schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder, respectively, and
15 controls. There was an increased P:S ratio (nuclear
pellet:postnuclear supernatant) in schizophrenia and major depression
compared to controls; the increase in bipolar disorder did not reach
statistical significance. The P:S ratio changes in major depression were
significantly influenced by substance/alcohol abuse and by postmortem
interval. The alteration in schizophrenic brains was not associated with
confounding factors, although an interaction with substance/alcohol
abuse could not be ruled out.

Burdick et al. (2008) noted that NDE1 (609449) is a homolog of NDEL1 and
also binds to DISC1. NDE1 was expressed at constant levels in the rat
cerebral cortex from embryonic day (E) 14 to adulthood, whereas NDEL1
expression showed a time-course increase peaking at postnatal day 7.
Further studies with a ser704-to-cys (S704C) polymorphism in the DISC1
gene showed that NDE1 bound stronger to ser704, while NDEL1 bound
stronger to cys704. The findings suggested an interaction of these 3
proteins, with possible competitive binding between NDEL1 and NDE1 for
DISC1.

Using knockdown studies, Mao et al. (2009) found that Disc1 was required
for neural progenitor cell proliferation in vitro, during embryonic
mouse brain development, and in adult mouse dentate gyrus. Disc1
interacted directly with Gsk3-beta (GSK3B; 605004) and inhibited
recombinant Gsk3-beta activity in a dose-dependent manner. This
inhibition of Gsk3-beta caused reduced phosphorylation and increased
stabilization of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806). Knockdown of Disc1 in
adult mouse dentate gyrus resulted in hyperactivity and depression-like
behaviors. All effects of Disc1 knockdown were reversed by pharmacologic
inhibition of Gsk3-beta. Mao et al. (2009) concluded that DISC1
regulates neural progenitor proliferation by modulating GSK3-beta
activity and beta-catenin abundance.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected HEK293 cells, Enomoto
et al. (2009) found that mouse Disc1 interacted with girdin (CCDC88A;
609736), a protein required for proper migration and positioning of
mouse dentate gyrus cells. Domain mapping revealed that the N-terminal
globular domain of Disc1 interacted with the N-terminal domain of
girdin. Girdin colocalized with Disc1 in cultured rat hippocampal
neurons, and knockdown of Disc1 via small interfering RNA impaired
girdin localization at growth cones.

Kim et al. (2009) found that adenovirus-mediated delivery of Kiaa1212
(CCDC88A) or a short hairpin RNA targeting Disc1 in adult mouse newborn
neurons caused elevated Akt (AKT1; 164730) signaling and resulted in a
migratory and positioning defect in the manipulated neurons. Disc1
knockdown or Kiaa1212 overexpression also caused an increase in neuronal
soma size and accelerated primary dendrite branching. Disc1 and Kiaa1212
coimmunoprecipitated from cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, dissected
adult mouse hippocampus, and transfected HEK293 cells. Direct
interaction of Disc1 with Kiaa1212 prevented Kiaa1212-dependent
activation of Akt signaling, and knockdown of Kiaa1212 abrogated
Disc1-dependent downregulation of Akt signaling. Pharmacologic blockage
of Mtor (FRAP1; 601231) also abrogated the effects of Disc1 knockdown or
Kiaa1212 overexpression, suggesting that Mtor is a major downstream
mediator of this signaling pathway.

Ishizuka et al. (2011) reported that phosphorylation of DISC1 acts as a
molecular switch from maintaining proliferation of mitotic progenitor
cells to activating migration of postmitotic neurons in mice.
Unphosphorylated DISC1 regulates canonical Wnt signaling via an
interaction with GSK3-beta, whereas specific phosphorylation at
serine-710 triggers the recruitment of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (see
209900) proteins to the centrosome. In support of this model, loss of
BBS1 (209901) leads to defects in migration, but not proliferation,
whereas DISC1 knockdown leads to deficits in both. A phospho-dead mutant
can only rescue proliferation, whereas a phospho-mimic mutant rescues
exclusively migration defects. Ishizuka et al. (2011) concluded that
their data highlight a dual role for DISC1 in corticogenesis and
indicate that phosphorylation of this protein at serine-710 activates a
key developmental switch.

By Western blot analysis of 60 fractionated postmortem brain samples
divided approximately evenly between individuals diagnosed with chronic
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression, and normal controls,
Leliveld et al. (2008) found that DISC1 partitioned in the insoluble
pellet in a subset of cases with psychiatric disease. In transfected
human neuroblastoma cells, when DISC1 was expressed at low levels, it
interacted with endogenous NDEL1; in contrast, when DISC1 was expressed
at high levels, it became insoluble and did not interact with NDEL1.

Using transfected COS-7 cells and cultured rat neurons, Atkin et al.
(2012) found that overexpressed human DISC1 accumulated in perinuclear
aggregates. Insoluble DISC1 recruited endogenous DISC1 away from the
mobile pool of DISC1 puncta and disrupted mitochondrial movement.
Treatment of cultured rat neurons with hydrogen peroxide shifted the
distribution of endogenous Disc1 to an insoluble fraction. Inhibition of
the proteasome or lysosome acidification increased the number of
DISC1-containing aggregates, suggesting that overexpressed DISC1 was
recruited to the aggresome-autophagy pathway for protein removal. Atkin
et al. (2012) concluded that insoluble DISC1 associates with aggresomes
and negatively impacts neuronal function.

Eastwood et al. (2010) found that the DISC1 binding partner PCM1
(600299) was localized to the centrosome in glia of human superior
temporal gyrus, but not in neurons, which showed widespread
immunoreactivity. The authors quantified centrosomal PCM1
immunoreactivity in superior temporal gyrus glia of 81 controls and 67
subjects with schizophrenia, and genotyped the subjects for the 2 DISC1
polymorphisms leu607 to phe (dbSNP rs6675281) and ser704 to cys (dbSNP
rs821616). Centrosomal PCM1 immunoreactive area was smaller in cys704
carriers than in ser704 homozygotes, with a similar trend in phe607
homozygotes compared with leu607 carriers. No differences were seen
between controls and subjects with schizophrenia. The authors concluded
that DISC1 coding variants modulate centrosomal PCM1 localization, and
proposed a role for DISC1 in glial function that may be altered in
psychiatric disorders.

MAPPING

Ma et al. (2002) determined that the mouse Disc1 gene maps to chromosome
8 in a region with homology of synteny to human chromosome 1q42. Ma et
al. (2002) demonstrated that translin-associated factor X (TSNAX;
602964), which is situated 35 kb proximal to the DISC1 sequence on human
chromosome 1, is located approximately 20 kb proximal to Disc1 in the
mouse at 69.5 cM.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The family studied by St. Clair et al. (1990) and Millar et al. (2000)
was originally ascertained by Jacobs et al. (1970), who reported the
translocation in the propositus, who had adolescent conduct disorder,
and in members of 4 generations of the extended family. Blackwood et al.
(2001) provided a follow-up. Of the 87 members of the family who were
karyotyped, 37 carried the (1;11)(q42;q14.3) translocation. A
psychiatric diagnosis was reached in 29 carriers, 38 noncarriers, and
the 2 founders (who were not karyotyped). The range of symptoms in this
family crossed traditional diagnostic boundaries, and the locus
identified by the breakpoint on 1q42 appeared to be implicated in either
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (125480). Furthermore, Blackwood
(2000) reported abnormalities in the auditory P300 event-related
potential, which showed prolonged latency and reduced amplitude in
affected members of the family.

Ekelund et al. (2001) used a large, population-based study sample (221
Finnish families, 557 affected individuals) to refine the localization
of schizophrenia loci on chromosome 1q. The results were analyzed
separately for families originating from an internal isolate of Finland
and for families from the rest of Finland, as well as for all families
jointly. Evidence for linkage was obtained for 1 locus in the combined
sample (maximum lod = 2.71, D1S2709) and in the nuclear families from
outside the internal isolate (maximum lod = 3.21, D1S2709). In the
families from the internal isolate the strongest evidence for linkage
was obtained with markers located 22 cM centromeric from this marker
(maximum lod = 2.30, D1S245). The strongest evidence for linkage in the
combined study sample was obtained for marker D1S2709, which is a marker
within DISC1. In a follow-up study to Ekelund et al. (2001), Ekelund et
al. (2004) genotyped 300 polymorphic markers on chromosome 1 using a
sample of 70 Finnish families with multiple individuals affected with
schizophrenia or related conditions. They again found linkage on
chromosome 1q42 maximizing within the DISC1 gene (dbSNP rs1000731, lod
of 2.70).

By analysis of SNPs and corresponding haplotypes across candidate genes
in the 1q42 region identified by Ekelund et al. (2001) as being linked
to schizophrenia in a Finnish sample, Hennah et al. (2003) identified a
significant region of interest within the DISC1 gene. They identified a
2-SNP haplotype spanning from intron 1 to exon 2 of the DISC1 gene,
designated HEP3 (605210.0001), and demonstrated that it was
undertransmitted to affected women in the general Finnish population.
The HEP3 haplotype also displayed sex differences in transmission
distortion, the undertransmission being significant only in affected
females. Hodgkinson et al. (2004) presented data from a case-control
study of a North American white population, confirming the
underrepresentation of the HEP3 haplotype in individuals with
schizoaffective disorder. Multiple haplotypes contained within 4
haplotype blocks extending between exon 1 and exon 9 were associated
with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder.
Hodgkinson et al. (2004) also found overrepresentation of a missense
allele of the DISC1 gene, leu607 to pro (L607P; dbSNP rs6675281) in
schizoaffective disorder. These data supported the idea that these
apparently distinct disorders have at least a partially convergent
etiology and that variation at the DISC1 locus predisposes individuals
to a variety of psychiatric disorders.

Cannon et al. (2005) conducted a population-based twin cohort study in
Finland to examine the association of SNPs of DISC1 and TRAX (TSNAX;
602964) with schizophrenia and several endophenotypic traits thought to
be involved in the disease pathogenesis. Two hundred and thirty-six
subjects consisting of 7 pairs concordant for schizophrenia (6
monozygotic, 1 dizygotic), 52 pairs discordant for schizophrenia (20
monozygotic, 32 dizygotic), and 59 demographically balanced normal pairs
(28 monozygotic, 31 dizygotic) were drawn from a twin cohort consisting
of all same-sex twins born in Finland from 1940 through 1957. Diagnosis
was confirmed and performance on neurocognitive tests of short- and
long-term memory as well as gray matter volume measurements as assessed
on MRI images were recorded. A common haplotype incorporating 3 SNPs
near the translocation breakpoint of DISC1 (HEP1; odds ratio, 2.6; p =
0.02) and a rare haplotype incorporating 4 markers from the DISC1 and
TRAX genes (combined HEP2/HEP3; odds ratio, 13.0; p = 0.001) were
significantly overrepresented among individuals with schizophrenia.
These haplotypes were also associated with several quantitative and
endophenotypic traits including impairments in short- and long-term
memory, functioning, and reduced gray matter density in the prefrontal
cortex.

Song et al. (2008) analyzed the regions of likely functional
significance in the DISC1 gene in 288 patients with schizophrenia and
288 controls. Six patients with schizophrenia were heterozygous for
'ultra-rare' missense variants (R37W, S90L, T603I, G14A, and R418H) not
found in 288 controls (p = 0.015) and shown to be ultra-rare by their
absence in a pool of 10,000 control alleles. Song et al. (2008)
concluded that these variants in DISC1 are associated with an
attributable risk of about 2% for schizophrenia. In addition, they
replicated the finding that 2 common structural variants (Q264R and
S704C) slightly elevate the risk for schizophrenia (OR, 1.3, 95% CI,
1.0-1.7).

Schumacher et al. (2009) reported a circumscribed interval in intron 9
of DISC1, which was significantly associated with schizophrenia in
females (p = 4.0 x 10(-5)) and contributed most strongly to early-onset
cases (p = 9.0 x 10(-5)) in a central European population of 1,621
individuals. The SNP interplay effect between dbSNP rs1538979 and dbSNP
rs821633 significantly conferred disease risk in male patients with
schizophrenia (p = 0.016; OR, 1.57). In a metaanalysis of 9
schizophrenia samples from different European populations covering 50
SNPs, the authors found evidence for a common schizophrenia risk
interval within DISC1 introns 4 to 6 (p = 0.002; OR, 1.27). Schumacher
et al. (2009) proposed a complex association between schizophrenia and
DISC1, including the presence of different risk loci and SNP interplay
effects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hikida et al. (2007) developed a transgenic mouse model expressing a
dominant-negative truncated form of human DISC1. In vivo brain MRI
showed enlarged lateral ventricles particularly on the left side in
juvenile mutant mice, similar to asymmetric brain changes observed in
patients with schizophrenia. There was also selective reduction of
immunoreactivity to parvalbumin (PVALB; 168890) in the cortex, marking a
possible interneuron deficit. Mutant mice displayed several behavioral
abnormalities, including hyperactivity, disturbances in sensorimotor
gating and olfactory-associated behavior, and an
anhedonia/depression-like deficit. Hikida et al. (2007) suggested that
the dominant-negative human DISC1 transgenic mouse could be an animal
model for schizophrenia.

Li et al. (2007) used an inducible and reversible transgenic system to
demonstrate that early postnatal, but not adult induction, of mutant
C-terminal DISC1 in mice resulted in a cluster of schizophrenia-related
phenotypes, including reduced hippocampal dendritic complexity,
decreased hippocampal synaptic transmission, depressive-like traits,
abnormal spatial working memory, and reduced sociability. Li et al.
(2007) postulated that alterations in DISC1 function during brain
development may contribute to pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

Clapcote et al. (2007) reported the behavioral phenotypes of 2
ENU-induced Disc1 mouse mutants: Q31L and L100P, both in exon 2. All
mutant mice were viable and grossly indistinguishable from their
wildtype littermates. L110P-mutant mice showed a schizophrenic-like
phenotype, with decreased prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition that
could be ameliorated by antipsychotic treatment. In contrast,
Q31L-mutant mice showed depressive-like behavior, with deficits in the
forced swim test and other measures that could be reversed by treatment
with the antidepressant buproprion, but not by rolipram, a PDE4
inhibitor. Brain MRI showed decreased brain volume in L100P-mutant mice
(decreased by 13%) and L31-mutant mice (decreased by 6%). Both mutant
Disc1 proteins showed decreased binding to PDE4B, and Q31L-mutant mice
had decreased PDE4B activity in the brain.

Kvajo et al. (2008) generated mice carrying a deletion in the mouse
Disc1 gene, resulting in premature termination, that modeled the
disease-associated translocation identified in humans and associated
with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder by Blackwood et al. (2001).
Mutant mice had alterations in the organization of newly born and mature
neurons of the dentate gyrus. Field recordings showed a deficit in
short-term plasticity in the hippocampus of mutant mice. Both homozygous
and heterozygous mutant mice showed a selective impairment in working
memory during a battery of cognitive tests. The results were consistent
with malfunction of neural circuits.

Wood et al. (2009) mapped the expression of zebrafish Disc1 and studied
its role in early embryonic development using morpholino antisense
methods. There was a critical requirement for Disc1 in oligodendrocyte
development by promoting specification of Olig2 (606386)-positive cells
in the hindbrain and other brain regions. Disruption of neuregulin
(Nrg1; 142445) and ErbB (EGFR; 131550) signaling in zebrafish brain
development yielded similar defects to those seen in disc1 morphant
embryos. Knockdown of Disc1 or Nrg1 caused near total loss of
Olig2-positive cerebellar neurons, but caused no apparent loss of spinal
motor neurons. Wood et al. (2009) suggested that Disc1 and Nrg1 function
in common or related pathways controlling development of
oligodendrocytes and neurons from Olig2-expressing precursor cells.

In developing mouse hippocampus, Meyer and Morris (2009) showed that in
utero electroporation of Disc1 short hairpin RNAs hindered the migration
of dentate gyrus granule cells. Disc1 knockdown did not affect the
migration of CA1 pyramidal neurons, suggesting that the role of Disc1 in
regulating neuronal migration may be spatially restricted within the
hippocampus. Meyer and Morris (2009) suggested that DISC1 abnormalities
that contribute to the onset of schizophrenia may do so through their
influences on hippocampal development.

Using in utero RNA interference transfer, Niwa et al. (2010) showed that
transient knockdown of Disc1 in prefrontal cortex in mice at embryonic
day 14 led to maturation-dependent deficits in mesocortical dopaminergic
projections and associated behavioral changes, including those in
information processing and cognition.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SCHIZOPHRENIA 9
DISC1, HAPLOTYPE, HEP3

Hennah et al. (2003) identified a common haplotype, HEP3, that was
undertransmitted in Finnish females with schizophrenia (SCZD9; 604906).
The HEP3 haplotype contains 2 SNPS in the DISC1 gene (dbSNP rs751229,
dbSNP rs3738401) that span 62 kb from intron 1 to exon 2. Hodgkinson et
al. (2004) confirmed underrepresentation of the HEP3 haplotype in
individuals with schizoaffective disorder.

Hennah et al. (2005) tested whether identified allelic haplotypes of
TRAX (602964)/DISC were associated with visual or verbal memory
dysfunction known to aggregate with schizophrenia in families. The HEP3
haplotype of DISC1 displayed association with poorer performance on
tests assessing short-term visual memory and attention. Analysis of
affected and unaffected offspring separately revealed that both samples
contributed to the observed association in visual working memory. The
results provided genetic support for the view that the DISC1 gene
contributes to sensitivity to schizophrenia and affects short-term
visual memory functions.

Among Finnish twin pairs discordant for the HEP3 haplotype, Li et al.
(2007) found a significant association between presence of the haplotype
and decreased sociability, suggesting that DISC1 has an effect on social
behavior.

186946	TITLE *186946 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 2; FKBP2
;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, T-CELL, 13-KD; FKBP13
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

Jin et al. (1991) reported the cloning and subcellular localization of a
13-kD FK506-binding protein (FKBP13), which has a 21-amino acid signal
peptide and appears to be membrane-associated. The 120-amino acid mature
protein appears to lack a transmembrane domain but a potential
endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence (arg-thr-glu-leu) is found at
its C terminus. FKBP13 shares 51% nucleotide sequence identity and 43%
amino acid sequence identity with FKBP12 (FKBP1; 186945), the
predominant FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein in human T cells. Jin
et al. (1991) noted that conserved residues that comprise the drug
binding site and rotamase active site of FKBP12 are completely conserved
in FKBP13.

GENE STRUCTURE

DiLella et al. (1992) found that the FKBP2 gene is 3 kb long and
contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, DiLella et al. (1992) mapped the
FKBP2 gene to 11q13.1-q13.3.

Courseaux et al. (1996) used a combination of methods to refine maps of
the approximately 5-Mb region of 11q13 that includes MEN1 (131100). They
proposed the following gene order:
cen--PGA--FTH1--UGB--AHNAK--ROM1--MDU1--CHRM1--COX8--EMK1--FKBP2--PLCB3--[PYGM,
ZFM1]--FAU--CAPN1--[MLK3, RELA]--FOSL1--SEA--CFL1--tel.

607991	TITLE *607991 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 8 (SODIUM-CALCIUM EXCHANGER), MEMBER 3; SLC8A3
;;SODIUM-CALCIUM EXCHANGER 3; NCX3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Plasma membrane sodium-calcium exchangers, such as SLC8A3, are
reversible transporters controlling Ca(2+) homeostasis. The forward
sodium-calcium exchange extrudes 1 Ca(2+) for 3 extracellular Na(+)
ions, using the Na(+) gradient and the electrical potential across the
plasma membrane as an energy source.

CLONING

Nicoll et al. (1996) cloned rat Slc8a3, which they designated Ncx3. The
deduced 927-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, 11
transmembrane segments, a long cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane
segments 5 and 6, and alpha and beta repeat sequences characteristic of
exchange proteins. The authors predicted that the N terminus is
extracellular and the C terminus is intracellular. Slc8a3 contains 5
N-glycosylation sites and 4 phosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis of rat tissues detected a 6.0-kb transcript only in brain and
skeletal muscle.

By searching databases for sequences similar to rat Slc8a3, followed by
RT-PCR of neuroblastoma cell line total RNA, Gabellini et al. (2002)
cloned SLC8A3, which they designated NCX3. The deduced 921-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal cluster of 5 transmembrane domains and a
C-terminal cluster of 5 transmembrane domains. The clusters are
separated by a large hydrophilic intracellular loop. Gabellini et al.
(2002) identified complex alternative splicing in the exons encoding the
intracellular loop. The form expressed in brain and the neuroblastoma
cell line has 7 of 9 exons, lacking exons 3 and 5. In addition to this
isoform, 2 other isoforms were expressed in skeletal muscle: one lacking
only exon 3, and the other lacking exons 3, 4, and 5, resulting in a
terminating frameshift. The predicted proteins range in size from 68 to
100 kD. The coding region of SLC8A3 shares 68% and 71% amino acid
identity with SLC8A1 (182305) and SLC8A2 (601901), respectively, and 97%
identity with rat Slc8a3.

GENE FUNCTION

Nicoll et al. (1996) determined that transfection of rat Slc8a3 into
baby hamster kidney cells mediated a 12-fold increase in Na(+)
gradient-dependent Ca(2+) uptake relative to control cells.

Using promoter-reporter constructs, Gabellini et al. (2002) found that
expression of the SLC8A3 promoter in neuroblastoma cells was promoted by
retinoic acid, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (113505), and rising
cAMP levels. Ca(2+) was inhibitory, and inhibition was mediated by CAMK2
(see 114078)-directed phosphorylation of CREB (see 123810).

GENE STRUCTURE

Gabellini et al. (2002) determined that the SLC8A3 gene contains 9 exons
and spans about 150 kb. Exon 1 is untranslated.

Gabellini et al. (2002) determined that the promoter region of SLC8A3
contains a TATA box and several GC boxes, indicating constitutive
transcription. It also includes binding sites for brain-specific AP2
(107580) transcription factor and for muscle-specific MyoD (159970),
GATA2 (137295), and GATA3 (131320).

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gabellini et al. (2002) mapped the SLC8A3
gene to chromosome 14q24.2. Nicoll et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Slc8a3
gene to chromosome 12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sokolow et al. (2004) produced mice deficient in Ncx3. Ncx3-deficient
mice presented a skeletal muscle fiber necrosis and a defective
neuromuscular transmission, reflecting the absence of Ncx3 in the
sarcolemma of the muscle fibers and at the neuromuscular junction. The
defective neuromuscular transmission was characterized by the presence
of electromyographic abnormalities. The findings indicated that NCX3
plays an important role in vivo in the control of Ca(2+) concentrations
in skeletal muscle fibers and at the neuromuscular junction.

Molinaro et al. (2008) demonstrated that homozygous ablation of the Ncx3
gene in mice increased the extent of ischemic brain lesions after middle
cerebral artery occlusion, particularly in the temporoparietal cortex,
compared to controls. Cultured hippocampal cells from Ncx3-deficient
mice showed significantly increased cell death in response to oxygen
glucose deprivation compared to wildtype cells. Hypoxic conditions
increased the reverse mode of the transporter in wildtype cells, but
this reverse current was significantly decreased in Ncx3-deficient
cells. The findings indicated impaired Ca(2+) and Na(+) homeostasis
resulting from absence of Ncx3. Molinaro et al. (2008) noted that NCX3
activity is ATP-independent and can thus function normally even during
ischemic conditions, and suggested that wildtype Ncx3 may have
beneficial effects during hypoxic conditions by decreasing cellular
Na(+) content in the initial stages.

;;HERPESVIRUS ENTRY MEDIATOR; HVEM;;
HERPESVIRUS ENTRY MEDIATOR A; HVEA;;
TR2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TNFRSF14, or HVEM, activates NF-kappa-B (see 164011) through the
canonical TNF-related cytokine LIGHT (TNFSF14; 604520), serving as a
costimulatory pathway during activation of T cells. TNFRSF14 also
functions as a ligand for the immunoglobulin superfamily members BTLA
(607925) and CD160 (604463), both of which limit inflammatory responses
initiated by T cells (summary by Cheung et al., 2009).

CLONING

Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family play a key
role in regulating the immune response to infection (see TNFR1, 191190).
By screening for genes that could mediate the entry of herpes simplex
virus (HSV) into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Montgomery et al.
(1996) identified cDNAs encoding HVEM, a member of the TNFR family. The
predicted 283-amino acid protein has characteristics of a type I
membrane glycoprotein, with an N-terminal signal peptide, 2 potential
sites for addition of N-linked glycans, and a putative membrane-spanning
domain. HVEM contains a cysteine-rich repeat region characteristic of
TNFR family members and shares 17 to 25% amino acid identity with other
TNFRs.

Independently, Kwon et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding HVEM, which they
designated TR2. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.7-kb mRNA in several
tissues, with the highest expression in lung, spleen, and thymus.
Several additional larger mRNAs were observed in some tissues, and
several of the cDNAs contained insertions in the coding region, leading
Kwon et al. (1997) to suggest that HVEM is regulated at the level of
mRNA maturation. These authors reported that the in vitro translation
product was 32 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Marsters et al. (1997) also identified HVEM as a novel member of the
TNFR family. They attributed differences between their predicted amino
acid sequence and that of Montgomery et al. (1996) to polymorphism.

Hsu et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs for the mouse HVEM homolog, which they
designated ATAR (another TRAF-associated receptor). The predicted
276-amino acid mouse protein shares only 45% protein sequence identity
with human HVEM.

GENE FUNCTION

Montgomery et al. (1996) suggested that HVEM plays an important role in
HSV pathogenesis because it enhanced the entry of several wildtype HSV
strains of both serotypes into CHO cells, and mediated HSV entry into
activated human T cells.

Using epitope-tagged HVEM, Marsters et al. (1997) found that HVEM
interacted in vivo with several TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) proteins,
including TRAF1 (601711), TRAF2 (601895), TRAF3 (601896), and TRAF5
(602356). Expression of HVEM activated JNK1 (601158), NF-kappa-B, and
AP1 (165160), which control expression of multiple genes in response to
infection or cellular stress. Marsters et al. (1997) concluded that HVEM
is linked via TRAFs to signal transduction pathways that activate the
immune response.

By flow cytometric and RT-PCR analysis, Morel et al. (2000) showed that
the expression of the HVEM ligand, LIGHT, is upregulated, whereas HVEM
expression is downregulated, after T-cell activation, particularly
CD8-positive T-cell activation.

Using tetramer analysis, Sedy et al. (2005) found that the extracellular
Ig domain of BTLA interacted with the most membrane-distal cysteine-rich
domain of HVEM. Flow cytometric and Western blot analyses showed that
HVEM induced BTLA tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibited T-cell
proliferation in a BTLA-dependent manner.

By surface plasmon resonance analysis of a secreted protein library,
Gonzalez et al. (2005) identified HVEM as a specific, high-affinity
coreceptor for BTLA. HVEM bound LIGHT at a site distinct from that bound
by BTLA, and the 3 proteins could form a ternary complex. The
BTLA-binding site in HVEM overlapped with that for HSV glycoprotein D,
indicating that BTLA likely interacts with the first cysteine-rich
domain of HVEM. Binding of HVEM to BTLA inhibited T-cell proliferation.
Gonzalez et al. (2005) concluded that HVEM and BTLA form an inhibitory
coreceptor pair.

Using flow cytometry, Western blot, and immunocytochemical analyses and
reporter assays, Cheung et al. (2009) demonstrated that
membrane-expressed or soluble herpes virus envelope glycoprotein D,
BTLA, and CD160 (604463) functioned as activating ligands of HVEM,
promoting NFKB activation and cell survival. BTLA and CD160 engagement
induced the recruitment of TRAF2, but not TRAF3, to HVEM, which
specifically activated the RELA (164014), but not the RELB (604758),
form of NFKB. Cheung et al. (2009) concluded that HVEM and BTLA form a
bidirectional signaling pathway regulating cell survival and inhibitory
responses between interacting cells.

Shui et al. (2012) reported an important role for epithelial HVEM in
innate mucosal defense against pathogenic bacteria. HVEM enhances immune
responses by NF-kappa-B-inducing kinase-dependent STAT3 (102582)
activation, which promotes the epithelial expression of genes important
for immunity. During intestinal Citrobacter rodentium infection, a mouse
model for enteropathogenic E. coli infection, Hvem-null mice showed
decreased Stat3 activation, impaired responses in the colon, higher
bacterial burdens, and increased mortality. Shui et al. (2012)
identified the immunoglobulin superfamily molecule CD160, expressed
predominantly by innate-like intraepithelial lymphocytes, as the ligand
engaging epithelial HVEM for host protection. Likewise, in pulmonary
Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, HVEM is also required for host
defense. Shui et al. (2012) concluded that their results pinpointed HVEM
as an important orchestrator of mucosal immunity, integrating signals
from innate lymphocytes to induce optimal epithelial Stat3 activation,
which indicated that targeting HVEM with agonists could improve host
defense.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

HSV infection requires binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein D (gD)
to cell surface receptors. Carfi et al. (2001) reported the x-ray
structures of a soluble, truncated ectodomain of gD both alone and in
complex with the ectodomain of its cellular receptor, TNFRSF14, which
they called HVEA. Two bound anions suggested possible binding sites for
another gD receptor, a 3-O-sulfonated heparan sulfate. The structures
revealed a V-like immunoglobulin fold at the core of gD that is closely
related to cellular adhesion molecules and flanked by large N- and
C-terminal extensions. The receptor-binding segment of gD, an N-terminal
hairpin, appeared conformationally flexible, suggesting that a
conformational change accompanying binding might be part of the viral
entry mechanism.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Kwon et al. (1997) mapped the
HVEM gene to 1p36.3-p36.2. This region also contains the TNFR genes CD30
(153243), ILA (602250), TXGP1L (600315), and TNFR2 (191191), suggesting
that HVEM evolved through a localized gene duplication event.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a mouse model of acute hepatitis, Wahl et al. (2009) showed that
Hvem -/- mice had lower serum alanine transaminase (GPT; 138200) levels
and lower Ifng (147570), but higher protective Il22 (605330) levels.
Histologic analysis showed attenuated disease in Hvem -/- mice. Flow
cytometric analysis demonstrated reduced numbers of liver invariant NKT
cells, but these cells produced more Il22 and less Ifng than wildtype
liver invariant NKT cells. Neutralization of Il22 aggravated disease in
both wildtype and Hvem -/- mice. Wahl et al. (2009) concluded that Hvem
expression promotes pathogenic, proinflammatory Th1 responses and
diminishes protective Il22 responses in this hepatitis model.

Steinberg et al. (2008) transferred naive Cd4 (186940)-positive/Cd45rb
(151460)-high T cells, depleted of Cd25 (147730)-positive regulatory T
cells, from Hvem -/- or wildtype mice into Rag (see 179615) -/- mice.
They found that the naive wildtype T cells, and to a lesser extent the
Hvem -/- T cells, induced progressive disease and colitis. However, in
recipient mice that also lacked Hvem, there was a dramatic acceleration
of intestinal inflammation, accompanied by increased T-cell cytokine
production. Transfer of naive T cells into Hvem -/- Rag -/- recipients
treated with anti-Btla reduced both cytokine production in vitro and
colitis development in vivo. Steinberg et al. (2008) concluded that HVEM
can act as a receptor to enhance immune responses by binding LIGHT and
as a ligand to suppress immune responses by binding BTLA.

135940	TITLE *135940 FILAGGRIN; FLG
PROFILAGGRIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Profilaggrin is a major protein component of the keratohyalin granules
of mammalian epidermis. It is initially expressed as a large polyprotein
precursor which is subsequently proteolytically processed into
individual functional filaggrin molecules. The filaggrins show wide
species variations and their aberrant expression has been implicated in
a number of keratinizing disorders (Baden et al., 1974; Holbrook et al.,
1982; Sybert et al., 1985).

CLONING

McKinley-Grant et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA clone encoding human
filaggrin. They demonstrated that the human gene encodes a polyprotein
precursor containing numerous tandem filaggrin repeats. This structure
is similar to that of the mouse; however, the human filaggrin repeat is
much longer (972 basepairs; 324 amino acids) and shows little sequence
homology to the mouse protein. They found furthermore that the human
filaggrin repeats show considerable sequence variations; such
polymorphism is not found in the mouse. By peptide mapping, they defined
a short linker sequence within the human filaggrin repeat that is
excised by proteolysis to yield functional molecules. They showed by in
situ hybridization that the expression of the gene for the human
filaggrin precursor is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level in
terminally differentiating epidermis.

Gan et al. (1990) isolated genomic DNA and cDNA clones encoding the
5-prime and 3-prime ends of the human gene and mRNA. They found evidence
of likely CAT and TATA sequences, an intron in the 5-prime untranslated
region, and several potential regulatory sequences. The gene is made up
of repeats, all of the same length. Sequences showed considerable
variation, most attributable to single-base changes. Thus, human
filaggrin consists of a heterogeneous population of molecules of
different sizes, charges, and sequences. Amino acid sequences encoding
the amino and carboxyl termini were more conserved, as were the 5-prime
and 3-prime DNA sequences flanking the coding portions of the gene. The
presence of unique restriction enzyme sites in these conserved flanking
sequences enabled Gan et al. (1990) to calculate the size of the
full-length gene and the number of repeats in it; depending on the
source of genomic DNA, the gene contains 10, 11, or 12 filaggrin repeats
that segregate in families in a normal mendelian manner. Thus, the human
profilaggrin gene is polymorphic with respect to size due to simple
allelic differences between individuals.

GENE STRUCTURE

The FLG gene comprises 3 exons (Presland et al., 1992).

MAPPING

Using a cDNA clone as a probe in the study of a panel of mouse-human
somatic cell hybrids retaining overlapping subsets of human chromosomal
regions and for chromosomal in situ hybridization, McKinley-Grant et al.
(1989) demonstrated that the human filaggrin gene maps to 1q21.
Rothnagel et al. (1994) mapped the homologous gene to mouse chromosome 3
by PCR analyses of DNAs isolated from mouse/Chinese hamster somatic cell
hybrids.

Genes of 3 protein families that are specifically expressed in the
course of terminal differentiation of human epidermis have been mapped
to 1q21. Volz et al. (1993) showed that these genes are physically
linked within 2.05 Mb of DNA in the following order: calpactin I light
chain (CAL1L; 114085), trichohyalin (THL; 190370), profilaggrin,
involucrin (IVL; 147360), small proline-rich protein (SPRR1A; 182265),
loricrin (LOR; 152445), and calcyclin (CACY; 114110).

GENE FUNCTION

Smith et al. (2006) reviewed the function of filaggrin, also known as
filament-aggregating protein, in the formation of the stratum corneum.
Keratohyalin granules in the granular layer of interfollicular epidermis
are predominantly composed of the 400-kD protein profilaggrin. Following
a short, unique N-terminal domain, most of the profilaggrin molecule
consists of 10 to 12 repeats of the 324-residue filaggrin sequence (Gan
et al., 1990). Upon terminal differentiation of granular cells,
profilaggrin is proteolytically cleaved into filaggrin peptides of
approximately 37 kD and the N-terminal domain containing an S100-like
calcium-binding domain. Filaggrin rapidly aggregates the keratin
cytoskeleton, causing collapse of the granular cells into flattened
anuclear squames. This condensed cytoskeleton is crosslinked by
transglutaminases during formation of the cornified cell envelope (CCE).
The CCE is the outermost barrier layer of the skin which not only
prevents water loss but also impedes the entry of allergens and
infectious agents. Filaggrin is therefore a key protein in facilitating
epidermal differentiation and maintaining barrier function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 15 kindreds with ichthyosis vulgaris (146700), Smith et al. (2006)
identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations R501X
(135940.0001) and 2282del4 (135940.0002) in the FLG gene in individuals
with a moderate or severe phenotype. They concluded that these mutations
are semidominant; heterozygotes show a very mild phenotype with
incomplete penetrance. The mutations showed a combined allele frequency
of approximately 4% in populations of European ancestry, explaining the
high incidence of ichthyosis vulgaris. Profilaggrin is the major protein
of keratohyalin granules in the epidermis. During terminal
differentiation, it is cleaved into multiple filaggrin peptides that
aggregate keratin filaments. The resultant matrix is crosslinked to form
a major component of the cornified cell envelope. Smith et al. (2006)
found that loss or reduction of this major structural protein leads to
varying degrees of impaired keratinization.

Twin and family studies have indicated a highly heritable predisposition
to atopic disease, including atopic dermatitis (see 603165), allergy,
and asthma (see 600807). Although genetic studies have focused on
immunologic mechanisms of atopic dermatitis, a primary epithelial
barrier defect has been anticipated (Cookson and Moffatt, 2002).
Filaggrin is a key protein that facilitates terminal differentiation of
the epidermis and formation of the skin barrier. Palmer et al. (2006)
showed that 2 independent loss-of-function genetic variants, R501X
(135940.0001) and 2282del4 (135940.0002), in the FLG gene are very
strong predisposing factors for atopic dermatitis (605803). These
mutations had been shown to be the cause of ichthyosis vulgaris in 15
families and isolated cases (Smith et al., 2006). The R501X and 2282del4
variants, carried by approximately 9% of people of European origin, also
showed highly significant association with asthma occurring in the
context of atopic dermatitis. This work established a key role for
impaired skin barrier function in the development of atopic disease.

Sandilands et al. (2007) showed that the 2 common filaggrin-null
mutations reported by Smith et al. (2006) and Palmer et al. (2006) are
ancestral European variants carried on conserved haplotypes. To
facilitate comprehensive analysis in other populations, they reported a
strategy for full sequencing of this large, highly repetitive gene, and
described 15 variants, including 7 that are prevalent. All the variants
were either nonsense or frameshift mutations that, in representative
cases, resulted in loss of filaggrin production in the epidermis. In an
Irish case-control study, the 5 most common European mutations showed a
strong association with moderate to severe childhood eczema. They found
3 additional rare null mutations in this case series, suggesting that
the genetic architecture of filaggrin-related atopic dermatitis consists
of both prevalent and rare risk alleles.

Using the transmission-disequilibrium test in 476 German
parent-offspring trios with atopic dermatitis, Weidinger et al. (2006)
found a significant association between the loss-of-function mutations
R501X and 2282del4 in the FLG gene and extrinsic atopic dermatitis,
allergic sensitization, total IgE level, asthma, and palmar
hyperlinearity; there was no significant association with intrinsic
atopic dermatitis.

Marenholz et al. (2006) genotyped 1092 children with eczema (atopic
dermatitis) from 2 large European populations for the R501X and 2282del4
mutations in the FLG gene and confirmed a highly significant association
between the null mutations and eczema and concomitant asthma. Moreover,
the authors found that these mutations predisposed to asthma, allergic
rhinitis, and allergic sensitization only in the presence of eczema,
highlighting the importance of the epidermal barrier in the pathogenesis
of these disorders (the so-called 'atopic march').

Nomura et al. (2007) sequenced the entire FLG gene in 7 Japanese
patients with ichthyosis vulgaris from 4 unrelated families who were
negative for the R501X and 2282del4 mutations, and identified
heterozygosity for 2 novel mutations, S2554X (135940.0003) and 3321delA
(135940.0004), respectively. The authors then screened 143 Japanese
patients with atopic dermatitis from 140 unrelated families for the
novel null mutations and identified S2554X in 6 patients and 3321delA in
2 patients; they were not found in 156 unrelated Japanese nonatopic and
nonichthyotic controls, yielding a chi-square p value of 0.0015. Noting
that the R501X and 2282del4 mutations were absent from a total of 253
Japanese individuals, including their patients with ichthyosis vulgaris
and atopic dermatitis, Nomura et al. (2007) concluded that FLG mutations
in Japan are different from those found in European-origin populations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Netherton syndrome (256500) is an autosomal recessive multisystemic
disorder characterized by congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, hair
shaft defects and atopy, caused by mutation in the SPINK5 gene (605010).
Hewett et al. (2005) created mice with an R820X mutation in the Spink5
gene. Newborn homozygotes developed a severe ichthyosis with a loss of
skin barrier function and dehydration, resulting in death within a few
hours. Biochemical analysis of skin revealed a substantial increase in
the proteolytic processing of profilaggrin into its constituent
filaggrin monomers. The authors suggested that in the absence of SPINK5
there is an abnormal increase in the processing of profilaggrin, and
that this may play a direct role in the observed deficit in the adhesion
of the stratum corneum and the severely compromised epidermal barrier
function.

Fallon et al. (2009) reported a 1-bp deletion mutation, 5303delA,
analogous to common human FLG mutations, within the murine Flg gene in
the spontaneous mouse mutant 'flaky tail' (ft). Fallon et al. (2009)
demonstrated that topical application of allergen to mice homozygous for
this mutation resulted in cutaneous inflammatory infiltrates and
enhanced cutaneous allergen priming with development of
allergen-specific antibody responses. These data validated flaky tail as
a useful model of filaggrin deficiency and provided experimental
evidence for the hypothesis that antigen transfer through a defective
epidermal barrier is a key mechanism underlying elevated IgE
sensitization and initiation of cutaneous inflammation in humans with
filaggrin-related atopic disease.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ICHTHYOSIS VULGARIS
DERMATITIS, ATOPIC, 2, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
FLG, ARG501TER

In 7 unrelated ichthyosis vulgaris (146700) families and 8 additional
'sporadic' cases from Ireland, Scotland, and the U.S., Smith et al.
(2006) found that ichthyosis vulgaris was associated with an
arg501-to-stop (R501X) mutation arising from a 1501C-to-T transition
near the start of repeat 1 in exon 3 of the FLG gene. In 3 families,
ichthyosis vulgaris patients with a very pronounced phenotype were
homozygous for R501X. In other families and isolated cases, they found
individuals with the marked ichthyosis vulgaris phenotype to be compound
heterozygous for R501X and a second mutation, 2282del4, in exon 3
(135940.0002).

Ichthyosis vulgaris is semidominant: that is, heterozygotes had either
no discernible phenotype or milder ichthyosis, whereas homozygotes or
compound heterozygotes had marked ichthyosis and an overt histologic
skin barrier defect. In an extension of the work of Smith et al. (2006),
Palmer et al. (2006) noted that in their families with ichthyosis
vulgaris, many individuals null or heterozygous for filaggrin also had
atopic dermatitis (605803) (eczema) and, in a few cases, also had asthma
(see 600807). Specifically, atopic dermatitis was prevalent in the
individuals with mild ichthyosis vulgaris, all of whom were heterozygous
for either the R501X or 2282del4 FLG-null allele (13/29; 44%). Atopic
dermatitis was particularly common in individuals with severe ichthyosis
vulgaris, all of whom were homozygous or compound heterozygous for
FLG-null alleles (16/21; 76%). None of the individuals in these families
who lacked an FLG-null allele had atopic dermatitis (n = 13). Thus,
atopic dermatitis is inherited as a semidominant trait in these
families, with high penetrance in FLG-null homozygotes or compound
heterozygotes and reduced penetrance in heterozygotes.

Using the transmission-disequilibrium test in 476 German
parent-offspring trios with atopic dermatitis, Weidinger et al. (2006)
found a significant association between the loss-of-function mutations
R501X and 2282del4 in the FLG gene and extrinsic atopic dermatitis,
allergic sensitization, total IgE level, asthma, and palmar
hyperlinearity; there was no significant association with intrinsic
atopic dermatitis.

Marenholz et al. (2006) genotyped 1092 children with eczema (atopic
dermatitis) from 2 large European populations for the R501X and 2282del4
mutations in the FLG gene and replicated the highly significant
association between the null mutations and eczema and concomitant
asthma. Moreover, the authors found that these mutations predisposed to
asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic sensitization only in the
presence of eczema, and that the mutations predisposed equally to atopic
(intrinsic) and nonatopic (extrinsic) forms of eczema. They demonstrated
that the presence of 2 null alleles is an independent risk factor for
asthma in children with eczema (OR, 11.76, p = 0.0085). Together, the 2
mutations accounted for approximately 11% of eczema cases in the German
population.

See 135940.0001 and Smith et al. (2006). The 2282del4 mutation leads to
a premature termination codon 107 bp downstream and, like R501X, stops
protein translation within the first filaggrin repeat.

Palmer et al. (2006) found an association of the 2282del4 and R501X
genetic variants of the FLG gene with atopic dermatitis; see
135940.0001.

Weidinger et al. (2006) found a significant association between atopic
dermatitis, in particular the extrinsic type, and the R501X and 2282del4
mutations; Marenholz et al. (2006) replicated the association and also
found that the presence of 2 null alleles was an independent risk factor
for asthma in children with eczema. See 135940.0001.

FLG, SER2554TER

In affected members of 2 unrelated Japanese families with ichthyosis
vulgaris (146700) who were negative for previously identified null
mutations in the FLG gene, Nomura et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 7661C-G transversion in exon 3 of the FLG gene,
resulting in a ser2554-to-ter (S2554X) substitution, predicted to cause
premature termination of profilaggrin translation in the filaggrin
repeat domain 7. The older sister of 1 proband, who had a severe
presentation of the disease, was found to be homozygous for S2554X. The
authors then screened 143 Japanese patients with atopic dermatitis
(605803) from 140 unrelated families for this null mutation and
identified S2554X in 6 patients. The mutation was not found in 156
unrelated nonatopic and nonichthyotic Japanese controls.

In 2 probands from 2 unrelated Japanese families with ichthyosis

mutations in the FLG gene, Nomura et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (3321delA) in exon 3 of the FLG gene,
resulting in a premature termination of profilaggrin translation in
filaggrin repeat domain 2. The authors then screened 143 Japanese
patients with atopic dermatitis (605803) from 140 unrelated families for
this deletion and identified 3321delA in 2 patients. The deletion was
not found in 156 unrelated nonatopic and nonichthyotic Japanese
controls.

610999	TITLE *610999 ENHANCER OF POLYCOMB, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; EPC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using RFP (TRIM27; 602165) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
testis cDNA library, followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, Shimono et
al. (2000) cloned EPC1. The deduced 836-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 92 kD. It has EPcA, EPcB, and EPcC domains
and a Qx region, all of which are highly conserved from yeast to humans.
Endogenous EPC1 localized to nuclear domains and to the nuclear membrane
in a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line.

The NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex is responsible for
acetylation of the N-terminal tails of histone H4 (see 602822) and H2A
(see 613499) in yeast. Its catalytic subunit, Esa1, is homologous to
human TIP60 (HTATIP; 601409). Using affinity purification, Western blot
analysis, cell fractionation, immunoprecipitation, and mass
spectrometry, Doyon et al. (2004) found that TIP60 and its splice
variant, TIP60B/PLIP, were part of a multisubunit NuA4 complex with HAT
activity in several human cell lines. They identified human homologs for
11 of the 12 yeast NuA4 subunits, including EPC1. Two isoforms of EPC1,
containing 813 and 836 amino acids, were detected in the NuA4 complex.

Using HOP (607275) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a heart cDNA
library, Kee et al. (2007) cloned EPC1. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous expression of a 4-kb transcript, with highest levels in heart
and skeletal muscle. Immunohistochemical analysis of embryonic mice
detected decreasing Epc1 expression with age in heart, but increased
expression with age in skeletal muscle. Epc1 was also expressed in
endothelium, spinal ganglia, and cartilage, but not in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Shimono et al. (2000) found that RFP interacted with EPC1 and that both
proteins repressed gene transcription. Yeast 2-hybrid assays revealed
that the coiled-coil domain of RFP associated with the EPcA domain and
the C-terminal region of EPC. Both proteins coprecipitated from lysates
of human cells and mostly colocalized in the nucleus. The coiled-coil
domain of RFP and the C-terminal region of EPC1 repressed
transcriptional activity in reporter gene assays, whereas the EPcA
domain of EPC1 activated transcriptional activity.

Doyon et al. (2004) found that a recombinant trimeric complex of TIP60,
EPC1, and ING3 (607493) was sufficient to reconstitute nucleasomal HAT
activity in vitro.

Kee et al. (2007) found upregulated expression of Epc1 during
differentiation of a rat myoblast cell line into skeletal myocytes.
Differentiation was induced by Epc1 overexpression and was severely
impaired in Epc1-knockdown cells. Cotransfection of Hop potentiated
Epc1-induced transactivation of myogenin (MYOG; 159980) and myotube
formation. Skeletal muscle of Hop-knockout mice showed decreased
expression of myosin heavy chain (see 160730) and myogenin, and
hamstring muscle of Hop-knockout mice showed delayed healing after
injury. Differentiation was impaired in skeletal myoblasts from
Hop-knockout mice. Kee et al. (2007) concluded that EPC1 plays a role in
initiation of skeletal muscle differentiation and that its interaction
with HOP is required for full activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutation in Pancreatic Cancer

Biankin et al. (2012) performed exome sequencing and copy number
analysis to define genomic aberrations in a prospectively accrued
clinical cohort of 142 patients with early (stage I and II) sporadic
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Detailed analysis of 99 informative
tumors identified substantial heterogeneity with 2,016 nonsilent
mutations and 1,628 copy number variations. Biankin et al. (2012)
defined 16 significantly mutated genes, reaffirming known mutations and
uncovering novel mutated genes including additional genes involved in
chromatin modification (EPC1 and ARID2, 609539), DNA damage repair (ATM;
607585), and other mechanisms (ZIM2 (see 601483); MAP2K4, 601335; NALCN,
611549; SLC16A4, 603878; and MAGEA6, 300176). Integrative analysis with
in vitro functional data and animal models provided supportive evidence
for potential roles for these genetic aberrations in carcinogenesis.
Pathway-based analysis of recurrently mutated genes recapitulated
clustering in core signaling pathways in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma, and identified new mutated genes in each pathway.
Biankin et al. (2012) also identified frequent and diverse somatic
aberrations in genes described traditionally as embryonic regulators of
axon guidance, particularly SLIT/ROBO (see 603742) signaling, which was
also evident in murine Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated somatic
mutagenesis models of pancreatic cancer, providing further supportive
evidence for the potential involvement of axon guidance genes in
pancreatic carcinogenesis.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Shimono et al. (2000) mapped the EPC1 gene
to chromosome 10p11.

611696	TITLE *611696 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22, MEMBER 20; SLC22A20
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 6; OAT6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC22A20 belongs to a large family of transmembrane proteins that
function as uniporters, symporters, and antiporters to transport organic
ions across cell membranes (Jacobsson et al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching a human database for SLC22 family members, Jacobsson et al.
(2007) identified SLC22A20. The deduced 573-amino acid protein has 12
putative transmembrane domains. Quantitative real-time PCR detected high
expression of rat Slc22a20 in coronal sections taken through the
olfactory bulb and forebrain. Expression was much weaker in other
coronal sections and in liver and adipose tissue, and was not detected
in other brain regions or in peripheral tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jacobsson et al. (2007) determined that the SLC22A20 gene contains 9
exons.

MAPPING

139380	TITLE *139380 GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEIN, BETA-1; GNB1
;;TRANSDUCIN, BETA POLYPEPTIDE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins)
transduce extracellular signals received by transmembrane receptors to
effector proteins. Each subunit of the G protein complex is encoded by a
member of 1 of 3 corresponding gene families, alpha, beta, and gamma
(Hurowitz et al., 2000).

CLONING

Retinal transducin is a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein that
activates a cGMP phosphodiesterase in photoreceptor cells. Fong et al.
(1986) identified and analyzed cDNA clones of the bovine transducin beta
subunit and deduced the primary structure of a 340-amino acid protein.
Significant homology was found with the yeast CDC4 gene product. The
beta-subunit polypeptide, of relative molecular mass 37,375 Da, is
encoded by a 2.9-kb mRNA. All mammalian tissues and clonal cell lines
examined contained at least 2 beta-related mRNAs, usually 1.8 and 2.9 kb
long. The authors suggested that there may be a diversity of beta
subunit-related mRNAs that could encode different proteins.

Codina et al. (1986) cloned a full-length G protein beta-1 subunit
(GNB1) from a human liver cDNA library. They found that the deduced
340-amino acid protein is identical to that encoded by bovine retinal
rod cell cDNA of the beta subunit of transducin.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coprecipitation analysis, Rosskopf et al. (2003) showed that GNB1
formed dimers with all gamma subunits analyzed. The strength of the
interaction was variable and was strongest between GNB1 and GNG3
(608941), GNG10 (604389), GNG12, and GNG13 (607298).

GENE STRUCTURE

Rosskopf et al. (2003) determined that the GNB1 gene contains 12 exons.
The first 2 exons and the last exon are noncoding.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe against a mouse/human somatic cell hybrid panel,
Sparkes et al. (1987) mapped the human beta-1 polypeptide of G protein
to human chromosome 1. Levine et al. (1990) confirmed the assignment to
chromosome 1 by Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrids, and Levine et
al. (1990) and Modi et al. (1991) regionalized the assignment to
1pter-p31.2 by in situ hybridization. Although Sparkes et al. (1987) had
mapped the mouse Gnb1 gene to chromosome 19, later studies showed that
Gnb1 is located on distal mouse chromosome 4 (Danciger et al., 1990).

ANIMAL MODEL

In the Rd4/+ mouse, autosomal dominant retinal degeneration cosegregates
with a large inversion spanning nearly all of chromosome 4 (Roderick et
al., 1997). To identify the responsible gene for this phenotype,
Kitamura et al. (2006) focused on the distal breakpoint and found that
it lay in the second intron of the Gnb1 gene, coding for the
transducin-beta-1 protein, which is directly involved in
phototransduction and in the normal maintenance of photoreceptors.
Kitamura et al. (2006) determined that before the beginning of retinal
degeneration in the Rd4/+ retina, the levels of Gnb1 mRNA and
transducin-beta-1 were 50% of those in wildtype retina. Kitamura et al.
(2006) suggested that disruption of the Gnb1 gene is responsible for
Rd4/+ retinal disease.

3; TSSC3;;
TUMOR-SUPPRESSING STF cDNA 3;;
IMPRINTED IN PLACENTA AND LIVER; IPL;;
BECKWITH-WIEDEMANN REGION 1C; BWR1C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A region of 11p15.5 contains several genes with documented functional
imprinting, defined as a consistent allelic bias of RNA expression in
somatic tissues. Imprinted genes in this region include H19 (103280),
IGF2 (147470), CDKN1C (600856), and KVLQT1 (607542). The size of the
region that contains these genes is approximately 1 Mb, similar to the
Prader-Willi syndrome (176270)/Angelman syndrome (105830) region of
chromosome 15, which also contains multiple imprinted genes. Qian et al.
(1997) stated that a strong sex bias in the rates of meiotic
recombination in imprinted regions suggested an accessibility model for
genomic imprinting in which extended regions of 'open chromatin'
specific to one type of gamete are selectively modified epigenetically,
leading to allele-specific transcription of at least a subset of the
genes in these regions in the offspring. A prediction is that a
positional cloning approach, i.e., chromosome walking in the vicinity of
known imprinted genes, should be successful in isolating additional
imprinted genes. Qian et al. (1997) described the human and mouse
versions of a novel imprinted gene, symbolized IPL (for 'imprinted in
placenta and liver') by them, that they identified by this approach. IPL
is located between NAP2 (601651) on the centromeric side and KIP2
(CDKN1C; 600856) on the telomeric side. In many human and mouse tissues,
the gene showed tissue-specific expression and functional imprinting,
with the maternal allele active and the paternal allele relatively
inactive. The mouse and human genes showed sequence similarity to
TDAG51, a gene that had been shown to be essential for FAS (134637) gene
expression and susceptibility to apoptosis in a T lymphocyte cell line.
Qian et al. (1997) detected high expression in the placenta, with lower
expression in the chorioamniotic membrane and a very low expression in
fetal and adult liver, lung, and kidney and adult pancreas.

By genetic analysis of a 170-kb region at 11p15.5 between loci D11S601
and D11S679, Schwienbacher et al. (1998) identified 6 transcriptional
units. Three of these, NAP2, CDKN1C, and KVLQT1, had been well
characterized, whereas the other 3 genes were novel. These were
symbolized BWR1A (602631), BWR1B (603240), and BWR1C, with BWR
designating 'Beckwith-Wiedemann region.'

GENE FUNCTION

Muller et al. (2000) stated that TSSC3 is the first apoptosis-related
gene found to be imprinted in placenta, liver, and fetal tissues, where
it is expressed from the maternal allele during normal human
development. Since several embryonal tumors show loss of imprinting of
genes in the 11p15.5 region, Muller et al. (2000) investigated the
imprinting status of TSSC3 in normal human adult brain, neuroblastomas,
medulloblastomas, and glioblastomas. Using a polymorphism in exon 1,
they found that the TSSC3 gene is not imprinted in normal human adult
brain or blood. In contrast, strong allelic bias resembling imprinting
could be detected in most tumors examined. The authors concluded that
the tumors under investigation are associated with a retention of
imprinting of a potential growth inhibitory gene.

MAPPING

Qian et al. (1997) identified the PHLDA2 gene on chromosome 11p15.5, in
a region that contains many imprinted genes. Qian et al. (1997)
determined that the mouse Ipl gene maps to the region of chromosome 7
that is syntenic with human 11p15.5.

GENE STRUCTURE

Like several other imprinted genes, mouse and human IPL are small and
contain small introns; human IPL contains a single 223-bp intron (Qian
et al., 1997).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ishida et al. (2012) identified a 15-bp tandem repeat (GGGGCGGGGAGGGGC)
located 48 bp upstream of the PHLDA2 transcription start site. The
tandem repeat is present in 87% of chromosomes. The minor allele is a
single copy and found in the remaining 13% of chromosomes.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in this
PHLDA2 promoter variant and birth weight, see 613219.

ANIMAL MODEL

The IPL gene lies in an extended imprinted region of distal mouse
chromosome 7, which also contains the IGF2 gene. Expression of Ipl is
highest in placenta and yolk sac, where its mRNA is derived almost
entirely from the maternal allele. Ipl encodes a small cytoplasmic
protein with a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain (summary by Frank et al.,
1999). Frank et al. (2002) constructed 2 lines of mice with germline
deletions of this gene and another line deleted for the similar but
nonimprinted gene Tih1 (607054). All 3 lines were viable. There was
consistent overgrowth of the Ipl-null placentas, with expansion of the
spongiotrophoblast. These larger placentas did not confer a fetal growth
advantage; fetal size was normal or slightly decreased in Ipl nulls.
When bred into an Igf2 mutant background, the Ipl deletion partially
rescued the placental but not fetal growth deficiency. Neither fetal nor
placental growth was affected by deletion of Tih1. These results showed
a nonredundant function of Ipl in restraining placental growth. The data
further indicated that Ipl can act, at least in part, independently of
insulin-like growth factor 2 signaling. Thus, genomic imprinting
regulates multiple pathways to control placental size.

610022	TITLE *610022 MYOSIN VC; MYO5C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using EST database analysis followed by PCR amplification of human
pancreas cDNA, Rodriguez and Cheney (2002) identified a new myosin V
family member that they named MYO5C. The MYO5C gene encodes a
1,742-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 203 kD that
shares approximately 50% identity with family members MYO5A (160777) and
MYO5B (606540). The MYO5C protein consists of a motor domain followed by
6 IQ motifs, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal globular domain.
MYO5C contains a serine residue conserved among all 3 class V myosins
whose phosphorylation in MYO5A regulates melanosome binding; however,
MYO5C does not contain the PEST region present in MYO5A and MYO5B.
Northern and dot blot analyses showed expression of an 8.7-kb MYO5C
transcript in salivary gland, stomach, colon, pancreas, lung, thyroid,
prostate, and mammary gland. Immunolocalization in mouse tissues
detected abundant Myo5c protein expression in pancreas, colon, and
stomach. Myo5c was found specifically in the apical regions of
intestinal epithelial cells and in exocrine pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Rodriguez and Cheney (2002) demonstrated, by overexpression of a
dominant-negative MYO5C tail construct in HeLa cells, that MYO5C
colocalizes with and perturbs a membrane compartment containing the
transferrin receptor (TFRC; 190010) and RAB8 (165040). Pulse-chase
experiments showed that overexpression of MYO5C also disrupts TFRC
trafficking.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using genomic sequence analysis, Rodriguez and Cheney (2002) determined
that the MYO5C gene consists of at least 39 exons and spans more than
100 kb.

MAPPING

Rodriguez and Cheney (2002) mapped the MYO5C gene to chromosome 15q21,
immediately adjacent to MYO5A, by genomic sequence analysis.

602201	TITLE *602201 EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEIN 1; ECM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mathieu et al. (1994) identified a novel 85-kD protein secreted by a
mouse osteogenic stromal cell line. Bhalerao et al. (1995) showed that
the full-length cDNA is 1.9 kb and contains an open reading frame of
1,677 bp that codes for a protein of 559 amino acids.

Smits et al. (1997) described a genomic clone containing the human
homolog, termed extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), from a chromosome
1 cosmid library. The ECM1 gene appeared to be expressed as a 1.8-kb
transcript predominantly in placenta and heart, while an additional
1.4-kb alternatively spliced message was detected in tonsils. The
full-length human ECM1 transcript contains 1,838 bp and has an overall
homology of 79.6% with the mouse Ecm1 cDNA. The transcript codes for a
protein of 540 amino acids that is 69.4% identical and 81.3% similar to
the corresponding mouse protein. The alternatively spliced variant,
1,450 bp long, encodes a protein of 415 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Smits et al. (1997) demonstrated that the coding region of the human
ECM1 gene comprises 10 exons.

GENE FUNCTION

Oyama et al. (2003) noted that HLA-subtype susceptibility and high rates
of other autoimmune disorders suggest that autoantibodies to specific
mucocutaneous antigens may be involved in the etiology of lichen
sclerosis (151590). The clinicopathologic similarities between lichen
sclerosis and lipoid proteinosis, which results from mutations in ECM1,
suggested that this protein may be an autoantigen in lichen sclerosis.
By immunoblotting, IgG autoantibodies to ECM1 were found in 20 of 30
lichen sclerosis serum samples. The highest titer was 1 in 20. These
samples, and those from 56 other patients with lichen sclerosis, showed
immunoreactivity to the recombinant ECM1 protein; 6 of 85 control serum
samples were positive. The findings suggested that specific humeral
immune response to ECM1 may be involved in the etiology of lichen
sclerosis and may offer help in disease diagnosis, monitoring, and
approaches to treatment.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Smits et al. (1997) mapped the
ECM1 gene to 1q21 outside the epidermal differentiation complex region
(see 152445). Bhalerao et al. (1995) mapped the gene to mouse chromosome
3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lipoid proteinosis, also known as hyalinosis cutis et mucosae or
Urbach-Wiethe disease (247100), is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder
typified by generalized thickening of skin, mucosae, and certain
viscera. Classic features include beaded eyelid papules and laryngeal
infiltration leading to hoarseness. Histologically, there is widespread
deposition of hyaline (glycoprotein) material and
disruption/reduplication of basement membrane. Using DNA from 6
consanguineous families, Hamada et al. (2002) mapped the disorder to
chromosome 1q21 at marker D1S498 (lod = 21.85 at theta = 0), within a
2.3-cM critical region. Using a candidate gene approach, the authors
identified 6 different homozygous loss-of-function mutations in ECM1.

LIPOID PROTEINOSIS OF URBACH AND WIETHE
ECM1, 1-BP DEL, 1019A

In affected individuals of a consanguineous Kuwaiti family with lipoid
proteinosis (247100), Hamada et al. (2002) identified homozygosity for a
single-basepair deletion (A1019) in exon 7 of the ECM1 gene. The
mutation resulted in a premature stop codon 108 bp downstream.

Hamada et al. (2002) identified a 14-year old Pakistani boy with lipoid
proteinosis (247100); he was the product of a consanguineous mating, and
was homozygous for a C-to-T transition at position 1036 in exon 7 of the
ECM1 gene. The mutation resulted in conversion of codon gln346 to a
premature stop codon (Q346X).

.0003
LIPOID PROTEINOSIS OF URBACH AND WIETHE
ECM1, 1163-BP DEL

Hamada et al. (2002) reported 4 sibs affected with lipoid proteinosis
(247100) within a consanguineous Saudi family. All affected individuals
were homozygous for an 1163-bp deletion in the ECM1 gene, which
eliminated part of intron 8 and all of exons 9 and 10.

.0004

In 2 unrelated subjects with lipoid proteinosis (247100) with different
ECM1 haplotypes, Hamada et al. (2003) identified a 507delT mutation in
exon 6 of the ECM1 gene. The authors suggested that the deletion, which
causes a frameshift and premature termination 23 bp downstream, may
represent a recurrent mutation in lipoid proteinosis.

609025	TITLE *609025 KERATIN 75; KRT75
;;KERATIN 6, HAIR FOLLICLE; K6HF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of anagen hair follicle cDNA, Winter et al.
(1998) cloned K6HF. The deduced 551-amino acid protein shares about 80%
homology with cytokeratin KRT5 (148040). In situ hybridization and
indirect immunofluorescence localization showed that K6HF was expressed
exclusively in the companion layer of the hair follicle before KRT17
(148069) and KRT16 (148067).

Wojcik et al. (2001) cloned mouse K6hf. The deduced 551-amino acid
protein shares 84.8% identity with human K6HF.

GENE FUNCTION

Wojcik et al. (2001) found that K6hf assembled into a keratin network
following transfection of kangaroo rat kidney epithelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rogers et al. (2000) determined that the K6HF gene spans 17.4 kb.

MAPPING

By screening an arrayed PAC DNA library, Rogers et al. (2000) mapped the
K6HF gene to a region of chromosome 12q13 that flanks a series of hair
keratin genes and pseudogenes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Winter et al. (2004) identified a nonsynonymous SNP in the KRT75 gene
(A12T; 609025.0001) that was significantly associated with the
development of pseudofolliculitis barbae (612318).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PSEUDOFOLLICULITIS BARBAE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
KRT75, ALA12THR

In 2 affected members of a Caucasian family with pseudofolliculitis
barbae (612318), Winter et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous G-to-A
transition in the KRT75 gene, resulting in an ala12-to-thr (A12T)
substitution in the 1A alpha-helical subdomain of KRT75. The mutation
was also present in an unaffected female relative who had straight hair
and did not shave regularly. In a larger group of 200 individuals,
Winter et al. (2004) found that the A12T SNP was present in 9% of
individuals without the disorder and 35% with the disorder, which was a
significant association (p less than 6 x 10(-6)). The incidence of the
A12T substitution in the investigated population was approximately 3
times higher in African Americans compared to Caucasians (36.7% vs
10.9%). Computer modeling showed that the A12T substitution occurred in
an external position on the surface of the coiled-coil domain and did
not affected the ability of alpha-helical structures to assemble in
parallel. However, in vitro expression studies showed that the variant
was disruptive at later stages, compromising the aggregation of keratin
molecules into intermediate filaments. Winter et al. (2004) postulated
that the A12T SNP destabilizes the mechanical integrity of companion
cells in the hair shaft, which may compromise the ability of the shaft
to move within the skin surface.

608420	TITLE *608420 PANNEXIN 1; PANX1
;;PX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bruzzone et al. (2003) cloned Panx1 from a rat hippocampus cDNA library.
The deduced 48-kD protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and
cytoplasmic N and C termini. Northern blot analysis detected Panx1
expression in rat eye, thyroid, prostate, kidney, liver, and central
nervous system. In situ hybridization showed Pnx1 expression in several
brain regions, including cortex, striatum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus,
thalamus, and cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

By functional expression in Xenopus oocytes, Bruzzone et al. (2003)
found that rat Pnx1 could support large, voltage-activated outward
currents. With coexpression of rat Panx2 (608421), the Panx1 currents
were reduced. In paired oocytes, Panx1 induced the formation of
intercellular channels with characteristics of gap junctions.

Erythrocytes do not form gap junctions, but Locovei et al. (2006) found
that human erythrocytes expressed pannexin-1. Pannexin-1 formed
mechanosensitive ATP-permeable channels in erythrocytes, and ATP release
by erythrocytes was attenuated by a gap junction blocker. Under
conditions of ATP release, erythrocytes took up tracer molecules
permeant to gap junction channels.

Thompson et al. (2008) noted that PANX1 is expressed at postsynaptic
sites in pyramidal neurons, suggesting that these hemichannels
contribute to dendritic signals associated with synaptic function. The
authors found that, in pyramidal neurons, NMDAR (138249) activation
induced a secondary prolonged current and dye efflux that were blocked
with a specific inhibitory peptide against PANX1 hemichannels. Knockdown
of PANX1 by RNA interference blocked the secondary current in cultured
neurons. Enhancing endogenous NMDAR activation in brain slices by
removing external magnesium ions triggered epileptiform activity, which
had decreased spike amplitude and prolonged interburst interval during
application of the PANX1-blocking peptide. Thompson et al. (2008)
concluded that PANX1 hemichannel opening is triggered by NMDAR
stimulation and can contribute to epileptiform seizure activity.

Apoptotic cells release 'find-me' signals at the earliest stages of
death to recruit phagocytes. Chekeni et al. (2010) identified the plasma
membrane channel PANX1 as a mediator of find-me signal/nucleotide
release from apoptotic cells. Pharmacologic inhibition and
siRNA-mediated knockdown of PANX1 led to decreased nucleotide release
and monocyte recruitment by apoptotic cells. Conversely, PANX1
overexpression enhanced nucleotide release from apoptotic cells and
phagocyte recruitment. Patch-clamp recordings showed that PANX1 was
basally inactive, and that induction of PANX1 currents occurred only
during apoptosis. Mechanistically, PANX1 itself was a target of the
effector caspases CASP3 (600636) and CASP7 (601761), and a specific
caspase cleavage site within PANX1 was essential for PANX1 function
during apoptosis. Expression of truncated PANX1 (at the putative caspase
cleavage site) resulted in a constitutively open channel. PANX1 was also
important for the 'selective' plasma membrane permeability of early
apoptotic cells to specific dyes. Collectively, Chekeni et al. (2010)
concluded that their data identified PANX1 as a plasma membrane channel
mediating the regulated release of find-me signals and selective plasma
membrane permeability during apoptosis, and a novel mechanism of PANX1
activation by caspases.

Karatas et al. (2013) described a signaling pathway between stressed
neurons and trigeminal afferents during cortical spreading depression
(CSD), the putative cause of migraine aura and headache (see 157300).
CSD caused neuronal PANX1 megachannel opening and CASP1 (147678)
activation followed by high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1; 163905) release
from neurons and nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) activation in
astrocytes. Suppression of this cascade abolished CSD-induced
trigeminovascular activation, dural mast cell degranulation, and
headache. CSD-induced neuronal megachannel opening may promote sustained
activation of trigeminal afferents via parenchymal inflammatory cascades
reaching glia limitans. Karatas et al. (2013) suggested that this
pathway may function to alarm an organism with headache when neurons are
stressed.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PANX1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP RH11012).

605117	TITLE *605117 SUPPRESSOR OF CYTOKINE SIGNALING 2; SOCS2
;;STAT-INDUCED STAT INHIBITOR 2; SSI2; STATI2;;
CYTOKINE-INDUCIBLE SH2 PROTEIN 2; CIS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SOCS proteins, such as SOCS2, negatively regulate cytokine receptor
signaling via the Janus kinase (see 147795)/signal transducer and
activation of transcription (STAT; see 600555) pathway (the JAK/STAT
pathway) (Minamoto et al., 1997).

CLONING

By a computer-aided homology search of sequence databases, Minamoto et
al. (1997) identified a partial sequence of SSI2, a member of the SSI
(STAT-induced STAT inhibitor) gene family. They isolated an SSI2 cDNA
from a Jurkat cDNA library. SSI2 encodes a protein of 198 amino acids.
The deduced amino acid sequences of human SSI2 and SSI3 (604176) share
significant homology with human and mouse SSI1 (SOCS1; 603597) and mouse
Cis (602441) at the C-terminal region as well as in the SH2 domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed strong expression of SSI2 in heart,
placenta, lung, kidney, and prostate.

On the basis of an EST database search, Masuhara et al. (1997)
identified SOCS2, which they called CIS2. They found that a C-terminal
40-amino acid region, designated the CIS homology (CH) domain, and the
SH2 domain are highly conserved in the CIS genes, while the respective
N-terminal regions of these proteins share little similarity.

Dey et al. (1998) identified SOCS2 based on its interaction with the
cytoplasmic domain of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R;
147370) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen. They cloned a full-length SOCS2 cDNA
by 5-prime RACE PCR of a human fetal brain cDNA library. Northern blot
analysis demonstrated expression of SOCS2 in many human fetal and adult
tissues, with particular abundance in fetal kidney and adult heart,
skeletal muscle, pancreas, and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Minamoto et al. (1997) found that SSI2 expression was induced by
cytokine stimulation, and its forced expression in the mouse myeloid
leukemia cell line M1 suppressed the apoptotic affects of LIF (159540)
similarly to SSI1.

Dey et al. (1998) found that the human SOCS2 protein interacted strongly
with the activated IGF1R and not with a kinase-negative mutant receptor
in yeast 2-hybrid assays. Mutation of receptor tyrosines 950, 1250,
1251, and 1316 to phenylalanine or deletion of the C-terminal 93 amino
acids did not result in decreased interaction of the receptor with human
SOCS2 protein. SOCS2 interacted with IGF1R both in vitro and in vivo.
Dey et al. (1998) concluded that their results raised the possibility
that SOCS proteins may play a regulatory role in IGF1 receptor
signaling.

Machado et al. (2006) showed that lipoxin A4 (LXA4) activated 2
receptors in mouse splenic dendritic cells, Ahr (600253) and Lxar
(FPRL1; 136538), and that this activation triggered Socs2.
Socs2-deficient mouse dendritic cells were hyperresponsive to microbial
stimuli and were refractory to the inhibitory action of LXA4, but not
Il10 (124092). Upon infection with an intracellular pathogen,
Socs2-deficient mice had uncontrolled production of proinflammatory
cytokines, decreased microbial proliferation, aberrant leukocyte
infiltration, and elevated mortality. Machado et al. (2006) also showed
that Socs2 was a crucial intracellular mediator of the antiinflammatory
actions of aspirin-induced lipoxins in vivo.

GENE STRUCTURE

Metcalf et al. (2000) demonstrated that the mouse SOCS2 gene is composed
of 3 exons and 2 introns.

MAPPING

By cytogenetic and radiation hybrid mapping, Yandava et al. (1999)
mapped the SOCS2 gene to chromosome 12q21.3-q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kato et al. (2006) performed a region-wide association analysis on
12q15-q22 using more than 500 SNPs in 1,492 unrelated Japanese
individuals and identified an association between type II diabetes
(125853) and a 13.6-kb haplotype block that includes the entire SOCS2
gene. Five SNPs in the 5-prime region of the SOCS2 gene were
significantly associated with type II diabetes. Kato et al. (2006)
concluded that SOCS2 may play a role in susceptibility to type II
diabetes in the Japanese.

ANIMAL MODEL

Metcalf et al. (2000) generated mice deficient in Socs2 by targeted
disruption. Socs2-deficient mice were indistinguishable from their
littermates until weaning at 3 weeks of age, but subsequently grew more
rapidly. Socs2 -/- adult males were on average 40% heavier than wildtype
littermates. Adult Socs2 +/- males exhibited an intermediate body
weight. Increased growth was also significant but less marked in female
Socs2 -/- mice. Adult Socs2 -/- females typically attained the weight of
wildtype male mice, but heterozygous Socs2 females were not
significantly heavier than sex-matched wildtype littermates. Neither
male nor female Socs2 -/- mice accumulated significantly more fatty
tissue than wildtype mice. Rather, increased body weight in these mice
resulted from an increase in the weight of most visceral organs.
Sexually dimorphic or male-specific organs were not disproportionately
enlarged. Carcass weight was also significantly increased, indicating
that muscle and bone may contribute significantly to the increased size
of Socs2-deficient mice. There was significant increase in long bone
length. Tail length was normal. The increase in size was due to elevated
cell numbers rather than increased cell size. Metcalf et al. (2000)
observed a marked thickening of the dermis associated with excessive
collagen accumulation in all of 7 males, and less prominently in 6 of 8
female Socs2 -/- mice. Collagen deposition was also increased around the
bronchi and vessels of the lungs of 6 of the 9 male, but only 3 of 10
female, Socs2-deficient mice. No hematologic abnormalities were
observed. The characteristics of Socs2 -/- mice were similar to those of
mice with growth hormone (GH; 139250) excess and IGF1 (147440) excess.
Characteristics of deregulated growth hormone and IGF1 signaling,
including decreased production of major urinary protein, increased local
IGF1 production, and collagen accumulation in the dermis were observed
in Socs2-deficient mice, indicating that Socs2 may have an essential
negative regulatory role in the growth hormone/IGF1 pathway.

Turnley et al. (2002) studied the role of Socs2 in mouse neural
development. They found that Socs2 was expressed by mouse progenitor
cells and neurons in response to LIF-like cytokines. Progenitor cells
lacking Socs2 produced fewer neurons and more astrocytes in vitro. Socs2
-/- mice had fewer neurons and neurogenin-1 (NGN1; 601726)-expressing
cells in the developing cortex, whereas overexpression of Socs2
increased neuronal differentiation. Turnley et al. (2002) found that GH
inhibited Ngn1 expression and neuronal production, and this action was
blocked by Socs2 overexpression. They speculated that Socs2 promotes
neuronal differentiation by blocking GH-mediated downregulation of Ngn1.

Using GH-deficient Socs2 -/- mice, Greenhalgh et al. (2005) demonstrated
that the Socs2 -/- phenotype is dependent upon the presence of
endogenous GH. Treatment with exogenous GH induced excessive growth in
terms of overall body weight, body and bone lengths, and the weight of
internal organs and tissues. Microarray analysis on liver RNA extracts
after exogenous GH administration revealed a heightened response to GH.
The conserved C-terminal SOCS-box motif was essential for all inhibitory
function. SOCS2 was found to bind 2 phosphorylated tyrosines on the GH
receptor (600946), and mutation analysis of these amino acids showed
that both were essential for SOCS2 function. Greenhalgh et al. (2005)
concluded that SOCS2 is a negative regulator of GH signaling.

177070	TITLE *177070 PROTEIN 4.2, ERYTHROCYTIC; EPB42
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Korsgren et al. (1990) cloned and sequenced protein band 4.2 from a
human reticulocyte cDNA library. The deduced 691-amino acid band 4.2
protein has homology with 2 closely related calcium-dependent
crosslinking proteins, guinea pig liver transglutaminase and the alpha
subunit of human coagulation factor XIII (F13A1; 134570). Within the 5
contiguous consensus residues of the transglutaminase active site, band
4.2 has an amino acid substitution which leads to loss of
transglutaminase activity. Sung et al. (1990) also cloned protein 4.2
and likewise found homology to the 2 transglutaminases, as well as the
lack of the critical residue required for enzymatic crosslinking of
substrates.

Korsgren and Cohen (1991) showed that reticulocytes contain 2 different
sized EPB42 messages; the major, smaller, message is produced by
alternative splicing. They found that the human and murine proteins
share 72% sequence identity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Korsgren and Cohen (1991) showed that the band 4.2 gene is about 20 kb
long and contains 13 exons. Alignment of the band 4.2 amino acid
sequence with that of F13A2 and division of the sequences into exons
showed a remarkable correspondence, and in most cases identity, in the
sizes of the paired exons.

Korsgren and Cohen (1994) found that the organization and size of the
human and mouse EPB42 genes are identical.

MAPPING

Sung et al. (1991) mapped the EPB42 gene to 15q15-q21 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Najfeld et al. (1992) assigned the gene to 15q15 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. White et al. (1992) mapped the Epb42
gene to mouse chromosome 2, which shares an extensive segment of
syntenic homology with human chromosome 15.

By long-range genomic PCR, Grenard et al. (2001) mapped the EPB42 gene
to a 100-kb region of 15q15.2, arranged in tandem with 2 other
transglutaminase genes, TGM5 (603805) and TGM7 (606776). By radiation
hybrid analysis, Grenard et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Epb42, Tgm5, and
Tgm7 genes in close proximity on chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

In the red cell membrane skeleton, protein 4.2 may regulate the
association of protein 3 (109270) with ankyrin (612641) (Davies and Lux,
1989).

Azim et al. (1996) demonstrated that both protein 4.2 and dematin
(125305) are ATP-binding proteins.

Bruce et al. (2002) observed that protein 4.2 and CD47 interact in the
human red cell membrane, which provided further evidence for an
association between the band 3 complex (which includes protein 4.2) and
the Rh complex, and defined a point of attachment between the Rh complex
and the red cell cytoskeleton.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 4 unrelated Japanese patients with autosomal recessive hereditary
spherocytosis (612690), Bouhassira et al. (1991, 1992) identified
homozygosity for a mutation in the EPB42 gene (177070.0001).

In a Portuguese woman with recessively transmitted hemolytic anemia,
Hayette et al. (1995) identified a mutation in the EPB42 gene
(177070.0002).

In Tunisian sibs with autosomal recessive hemolytic anemia reported by
Ghanem et al. (1990), Hayette et al. (1995) identified homozygosity for
a mutation in the EPB42 gene (177070.0003).

ANIMAL MODEL

The mouse 'pallid' mutation (see 604310) produces defects in at least 3
subcellular organelles: platelet-dense granules, melanosomes, and kidney
lysosomes. White et al. (1992) noted that the mouse Epb42 gene mapped to
the same region as the pallid mutation in the mouse. Prompted to examine
the Epb42 gene in the pallid mouse, they found changes on Southern blot
analysis suggesting a mutation; Northern blot analysis demonstrated
smaller than normal Epb42 transcripts in affected pallid tissues, such
as kidney and skin. However, Gwynn et al. (1997) and White et al. (1997)
excluded Epb42 as a candidate for the mouse pallid mutation. On Northern
blot analysis of normal and pallid mouse kidney, Gwynn et al. (1997)
observed that the truncated Epb42 protein comigrated with normal Epb42
protein. As the pallid mutation originally arose in a wild M. domesticus
mouse, they concluded that the Epb42 protein characteristic of pallid is
a normal polymorphism and that Epb42 and pallid are distinct loci.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-NIPPON
EPB42, ALA142THR

In 4 unrelated Japanese patients with spherocytosis (612690), Bouhassira
et al. (1991, 1992) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A transition in
the EPB42 gene, resulting in an ala142-to-thr (A142T) substitution. The
abnormality in protein 4.2 results in abnormally shaped and osmotically
fragile RBCs. The mutation occurred in an alternatively spliced exon
that is present in 2 of 4 EPB42 mRNA splicing isoforms. Thus this is a
recessive form of spherocytosis causing hereditary hemolytic anemia.

Iwamoto et al. (1993) identified the same mutation in a 27-year-old
Japanese female with acute hemolytic crisis and in her sister.

Perrotta et al. (1999) described the 4.2-Nippon mutation in a
30-year-old female born in a small mountain village in central Italy.
There was no Japanese ancestry. Splenomegaly and moderate hemolytic
anemia were present from birth.

.0002
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-LISBOA
EPB42, 1-BP DEL, 264G

Hayette et al. (1995) identified a defect in the EPB42 gene in a
26-year-old Portuguese woman with recessively transmitted hereditary
hemolytic anemia (612690). Protein 4.2 was absent from red cell ghosts
by Western blotting. Nucleotide sequencing disclosed deletion of a
single nucleotide at position 264 (or 265): AAG GTG was changed to AAG
TG in codon 88 (or 89) in exon 2. This change, defining allele 4.2
Lisboa, placed in frame the nonsense TGA triplet that normally overlaps
codons 136 and 137 (GTG ACC). In effect, codon 89 was changed from GTG
(val) to TGA (stop). The mutation was present in homozygous state in the
proband and in heterozygous state in the parents and a brother. Apart
from anemia, the patient was free of clinical manifestations. Hayette et
al. (1995) noted that in this case there were only a few spherocytes and
only a limited decrease in the osmotic resistance.

.0003
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-TOZEUR
EPB42, ARG310GLN

Using high-sensitivity Western blot analysis, Hayette et al. (1995)
found that the Tunisian sibs with autosomal recessive hemolytic anemia
(612690) originally reported by Ghanem et al. (1990) had trace amounts
of the EPB42 protein. They found that the sibs were homozygous for a
G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the EPB42 gene, resulting in an
arg310-to-gln (R310Q) substitution. The parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was absent in 48 control chromosomes of Tunisian
individuals.

.0004
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-NOTAME
EPB42, IVS6DS, G-A, +1

Protein 4.2 (Notame) was found in a 56-year-old Japanese man being
investigated for chronic hyperbilirubinemia (Matsuda et al., 1995). He
had mild splenomegaly and mild anemia with reticulocytosis as well as
microspherocytosis (612690). Erythrocyte osmotic fragility was
remarkably increased. SDS-PAGE showed complete deficiency of protein
4.2. Direct sequencing and dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific
oligonucleotide probes indicated that the man was a compound
heterozygote for the A142T mutation (177070.0001) and a single
nucleotide substitution (G to A) in the first nucleotide of intron 6 of
the EPB42 gene. RT-PCR analysis using total RNA isolated from
reticulocytes of the proband showed that the intron 6 donor site
mutation caused exon 6 to be spliced out with intron 6. The abnormal
mRNA had a premature termination codon as a result of a frameshift,
which precipitated instability of the protein that led to its
degradation.

.0005
SPHEROCYTOSIS, TYPE 5, DUE TO PROTEIN 4.2-HAMMERSMITH
EPB42, 41-BP DEL, NT1709

Bruce et al. (2002) presented data on a patient of Pakistani origin with
recessive spherocytosis due to absence of protein 4.2 (612690). EPB42
cDNA sequence analysis showed the presence of a 41-bp frameshift
deletion in the 5-prime end of exon 11 of the EPB42 gene that produced a
truncated peptide designated protein 4.2 Hammersmith. Quantitative
RT-PCR indicated that the mutant mRNA was unstable. Sequencing of
genomic DNA showed that the deletion stemmed from aberrant splicing. The
proband was homozygous for a G-to-T substitution at position 1747 that
activated a cryptic acceptor splice site within exon 11 of the EPB42
gene. The proband's mother was heterozygous for this substitution.
Unlike protein 4.2-null mice, the proband's red cells showed no evidence
of abnormal cation permeability. Quantitation of red cell membrane
proteins showed that CD47 (601028) was markedly reduced to about 1% (in
the proband) and 65% (in the mother) of that found in healthy controls.

609827	TITLE *609827 PELLINO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; PELI3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Toll-like receptors (TLRs; see 603030) and IL1R (IL1R1; 147810) are part
of the innate immune response aimed at mobilizing defense mechanisms in
response in infection or injury. Pellino proteins, such as PELI3, are
intermediate components in the signaling cascades initiated by TLRs and
IL1R (Jensen and Whitehead, 2003).

CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to PELI1 (614797) and PELI2 (614798),
followed by 3-prime RACE, Jensen and Whitehead (2003) cloned 2 splice
variants of PELI3, which they called PELI3-alpha and PELI3-beta. The
deduced 469-amino acid PELI3-alpha protein contains 24 amino acids
encoded by exon 3 that are absent in the 445-amino acid PELI3-beta
protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb transcript expressed
at high levels in brain, heart, and testis, and at lower levels in
kidney, liver, lung, placenta, small intestine, spleen, and stomach.
RT-PCR, but not Northern blot analysis, also showed PELI3 expression in
muscle and colon.

GENE FUNCTION

Jensen and Whitehead (2003) found that PELI3 interacted directly with
IL1R-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1; 300283), TNF receptor-associated
factor-6 (TRAF6; 602355), TNF-beta-activated kinase-1 (TAK1, or MAP3K7;
602614), and NFKB-inducing kinase (NIK, or MAP3K14; 604655) in an IL1
(see IL1A; 147760)-dependent manner. In reporter gene assays, PELI3
activated JUN (165160) and ELK1 (311040), but not NFKB (see 164011).
Jensen and Whitehead (2003) concluded that PELI3 plays a role in the
innate immune response and may be a scaffolding protein.

Butler et al. (2005) found that both isoforms of PELI3 could induce
expression of a reporter gene dependent on p38 MAPK (MAPK14; 600289)
activation in human embryonic kidney cells. Activation of p38 MAPK by
PELI3 coincided with binding of PELI3 to IRAK1. TRAF6 and TAK1 were
identified as downstream mediators of p38 MAPK activation by PELI3.
PELI3 promoted translocation of the p38 MAPK substrate, MAPK-activated
protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2; 602006), from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
and activated the transcription factor CREB (123810) in a p38
MAPK-dependent manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jensen and Whitehead (2003) determined that the PELI3 gene contains 8
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Jensen and Whitehead (2003) mapped the
PELI3 gene to chromosome 11.

610602	TITLE *610602 AlkB, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF, 2; ALKBH2
;;ABH2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Escherichia coli AlkB protein protects against the cytotoxicity of
methylating agents by repair of the specific DNA lesions generated in
single-stranded DNA. ALKBH2 and ALKBH3 (610603) are E. coli AlkB
homologs that catalyze the removal of 1-methyladenine and
3-methylcytosine (Duncan et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching human genomic and cDNA databases with ALKBH1 (605345) as
query, Duncan et al. (2002) obtained a full-length cDNA of ALKBH2. The
deduced protein shares 30.8% amino acid identity over the core region
with E. coli AlkB and shares similarity to
alpha-ketoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases in the C-terminal
region. Northern blot analysis detected ALKBH2 expression in all tissues
examined, as well as several carcinoma cell lines, with highest
expression in liver and bladder. Immunofluorescence studies localized
ALKBH2 to the nucleus with a diffuse pattern throughout the nucleoplasm
and accumulation in the nucleoli.

By PCR of a testis cDNA library, Tsujikawa et al. (2007) cloned
full-length ABH2 and an ABH2 splice variant. The deduced full-length
261-amino acid protein has a C-terminal AlkB homology domain that is
predicted to function as a 2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent
oxygenase domain. The ABH2 splice variant lacks exon 3 and encodes a
157-amino acid isoform lacking the AlkB homology domain due to a
frameshift. Quantitative real-time PCR detected variable ABH2 expression
in all 16 tissues examined, with highest expression in testis.
Fluorescence-tagged full-length ABH2 was expressed in nuclei of
transfected HeLa cells, with particularly bright nucleolar staining. The
ABH2 splice variant was more diffusely expressed in nuclei and
cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Using purified GST- and histidine-tagged ALKBH2 overexpressed in E.
coli, Duncan et al. (2002) showed that ALKBH2 catalyzed the removal of
both 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine from methylated
polynucleotides with 4-fold greater activity on 1-methyladenine than on
3-methylcytosine. ALKBH2 partially reverted 3-methylcytosine to cytosine
and repaired ethylated DNA bases through a mechanism similar to E. coli
AlkB activity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Yang et al. (2008) demonstrated the first crystal structures of
AlkB-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ABH2-dsDNA complexes, stabilized by
a chemical crosslinking strategy. This study revealed that AlkB uses an
unprecedented base-flipping mechanism to access the damaged base: it
squeezes together the 2 bases flanking the flipped-out one to maintain
the base stack, explaining the preference of AlkB for repairing
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) lesions over dsDNA ones. In addition, the
first crystal structure of ABH2 provided a structural basis for
designing inhibitors of this human DNA repair protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsujikawa et al. (2007) determined that the ALKBH2 gene contains at
least 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Duncan et al. (2002) mapped the ALKBH2
gene to chromosome 12q23.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ringvoll et al. (2006) generated mice with targeted disruption of Abh2,
Abh3 (ALKBH3; 610603), and Abh2/Abh3 double-knockout mice. Both single-
and double-knockout mice were viable and appeared normal into adulthood.
Using genomic DNA isolated from liver samples, the authors showed that
Abh2-null mice displayed an increased accumulation of 1-methyladenine
compared to wildtype and Abh3-null mice. Embryonic fibroblasts derived
from Abh2-null mice exhibited a decreased ability to remove methyl
methane sulfate (MMS)-induced 1-methyladenine from genomic DNA compared
to fibroblasts derived from both wildtype and Abh3-null mice. Ringvoll
et al. (2006) concluded that Abh2 is the primary oxidative demethylase
for repair of 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine in double-stranded
DNA, and that Abh2 and Abh3 have different roles in repair of DNA damage
caused by alkylating agents.

601176	TITLE *601176 GLUTAMATE-CYSTEINE LIGASE, MODIFIER SUBUNIT; GCLM
;;GLUTAMATE-CYSTEINE LIGASE, REGULATORY; GLCLR;;
GAMMA-GLUTAMYLCYSTEINE SYNTHETASE, REGULATORY SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, also known as glutamate-cysteine
ligase (EC 6.3.2.2), is the first rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione
biosynthesis.

CLONING

Human liver gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase consists of 2 subunits: a
heavy catalytic subunit (GCLC; 606857) and a light regulatory subunit.
Gipp et al. (1995) reported the cloning of a full-length cDNA for the
light subunit. The cDNA encodes a 274-amino acid protein of
approximately 30.7 kD that is 96% identical to the previously cloned rat
sequence (Huang et al., 1993). Northern blot analysis detected 1.4- and
4.1-kb transcripts in several tissue types. The smaller transcript was
detected in the colon, whereas both forms were found in skeletal muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rozet et al. (1998) determined that the GLCLR gene encompasses 22 kb and
contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Tsuchiya et al. (1995)
mapped the human GLCLR gene to 1p22-p21 and the mouse gene to 3H1-3. By
Southern blot analysis of DNA from a panel of somatic cell hybrids,
Sierra-Rivera et al. (1996) assigned GLCLR to chromosome 1;
sublocalization to 1p21 was achieved by FISH.

Rozet et al. (1998) found an EST of GLCLR within a YAC contig
encompassing the critically deleted region of human malignant
mesothelioma, between loci D1S435 and D1S236. They refined the physical
mapping of GLCLR to 1p22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nakamura et al. (2002) reported an association between a polymorphism in
the GCLM gene (601176.0001) and myocardial infarction (608446).

Schizophrenia (181500) is a major and frequent chronic psychiatric
disorder with a strong genetic component. Converging evidence points to
the involvement of oxidative stress and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor (138249) hypofunction in the pathophysiology of the disease. As
a main cellular nonprotein antioxidant and redox regulator, glutathione
(GSH) plays a major role in protecting nervous tissue against reactive
oxygen species and in modulating redox-sensitive sites, including NMDA
receptors (NMDA-R). Tosic et al. (2006) noted that studies had found GSH
levels to be decreased in patients' cerebrospinal fluid, in medial
prefrontal cortex in vivo, and in striatum postmortem tissue.
GSH-deficient models revealed morphologic, electrophysiologic, and
behavioral anomalies similar to those observed in patients. Tosic et al.
(2006) found an association between schizophrenia and the gene of the
key GSH-synthesizing enzyme, GCLM. A functional role of the GCLM gene
variance in schizophrenia was supported by its low expression in
patients' fibroblasts and by the decreased stimulation of the enzyme
activity when challenged by an oxidative stress. The findings were
considered consistent with the concept that an abnormal GSH metabolism
is a factor for schizophrenia. One of the case-control studies was
conducted in Switzerland and the other in Denmark. Two particular
combinations of variation at 3 SNPs related to the GCLM gene, TT/GG/TC
and CC/GG/TT, had odds ratios of 4.89 and 4.17, respectively. Tosic et
al. (2006) observed that the GCLM gene is localized on 1p21, a region
shown by previous linkage studies to be one of the several critical for
schizophrenia (Pulver et al., 2000, Arinami et al., 2005).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
GCLM, -588C-T

In Japanese patients with myocardial infarction (608446), Nakamura et
al. (2002) searched for common variants in the 5-prime flanking region
of the GCLM gene and identified a -588C-T polymorphism in which the T
allele showed lower promoter activity (40 to 50% of that of the C
allele) in response to oxidants. Analyzing 429 patients with MI and 428
controls, the authors found that the frequency of the T polymorphism was
significantly higher in the MI group than in the control group (p less
than 0.001). In multiple logistic regression analysis, the T
polymorphism was a risk factor for MI independent of traditional
coronary artery disease risk factors (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.38-2.83, p
less than 0.001). Nakamura et al. (2002) suggested that the -588T
polymorphism may suppress oxidant induction of the GCLM gene and that it
is a risk factor for MI.

Nakamura et al. (2003) examined the effects of the -588C-T polymorphism
on coronary arterial diameter and blood flow responses to intracoronary
infusion of acetylcholine in 157 consecutive patients with normal
coronary angiograms. In multivariate linear regression analysis with
covariates including traditional risk factors, the minor -588T allele
had an independent association with impaired dilation of epicardial
coronary arteries in response to acetylcholine (p less than 0.001), and
it was independently associated with a blunted increase in coronary flow
response to acetylcholine (p less than 0.01). In a subgroup of 59
consecutive patients, constrictor responses to intracoronary infusion of
NG-monomethyl-L-arginine monoacetate, had an inverse and independent
association with the -558T allele in multivariate analysis (p less than
0.01). Nakamura et al. (2003) concluded that the -588T polymorphism
causes a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide bioactivity, leading to
impairment of endothelium-dependent vasomotor function in large and
resistance coronary arteries.

611017	TITLE *611017 TRYPSIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; TYSND1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

All peroxisomal proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, and 2 distinct
peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs), the C-terminal PTS1 and N-terminal
PTS2, are used for transport of these proteins into peroxisomes.
Proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal targeting sequence of PTS2
proteins accompanies import into peroxisomes, and many PTS1 proteins
undergo C-terminal processing once in the peroxisomal matrix. TYSND1
processes both PTS1 and PTS2 proteins involved in beta-oxidation of
fatty acids (Kurochkin et al., 2007).

CLONING

By database analysis, Kurochkin et al. (2005) identified mouse Tysnd1
and its rat and human homologs. The mouse Tysnd1 protein has a PTS1
motif and 2 protease-related domains.

Kurochkin et al. (2007) stated that mouse Tysnd1 contains 568 amino
acids and has 2 trypsin-like serine and cysteine peptidase domains.
Western blot analysis of transfected COS-7 cells revealed a 59-kD
protein corresponding to full-length recombinant Tysnd1 and a 49-kD
protein representing the processed form. Fractionation of rat liver
homogenate and Western blot analysis showed that endogenous Tysnd1 was
synthesized as a 59-kD protein and converted to 49- and 27-kD forms
following import into peroxisomes. Confocal microscopy localized Tysnd1
to peroxisomes of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kurochkin et al. (2007) showed that mouse Tysnd1 processed the
PTS2-containing peroxisomal precursor 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase
(prethiolase, or ACAA1; 604054) and several PTS1-containing peroxisomal
enzymes, including peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX1; 609751), to
their mature forms in transfected COS-7 cells. Small interfering
RNA-mediated downregulation of TYSND1 in human embryonic kidney cells
blocked processing of these peroxisomal enzymes. Additional studies
showed that Tysnd1 directly processed peroxisomal enzymes in vitro,
including prethiolase, which it cleaved between cys26 and ser27 to
produce the mature form observed in vivo. Tysnd1 processing activity was
abolished by N-ethylmaleimide, an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases.
Kurochkin et al. (2007) determined that Tysnd1 itself is cleaved between
cys110 and ala111, presumably removing an inhibitory N-terminal
fragment.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TYSND1
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP D10S1466).

607349	TITLE *607349 TALIN 2; TLN2
;;KIAA0320
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones from a brain cDNA library, Nagase et al.
(1997) obtained a partial cDNA encoding TLN2, which they called
KIAA0320. RT-PCR detected expression in heart, brain, kidney, thymus,
testis, and small intestine.

Using genomic and cDNA/EST sequences, Monkley et al. (2001) assembled
the complete coding sequence for TLN2. The deduced 2,532-amino acid
protein contains a FERM domain. In TLN1 (186745), the FERM domain binds
the cytodomains of beta-1 (135630) and beta-3 (173470) integrins, as
well as to F-actin (see 102610) and other proteins. TLN2 shares 74%
identity with TLN1, and the N- and C-terminal regions of TLN2 are highly
conserved across species. Analysis of EST databases indicated that both
TLN1 and TLN2 are expressed in brain, lung, heart, eye, mammary gland,
colon, stomach, lymphocytes, germ cells, liver, spleen, bone, and many
tumors. Northern blot analysis of adult mouse tissues revealed multiple
Tln2 transcripts, with highest expression in heart and undetectable
expression in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

DiPaolo et al. (2002) and Ling et al. (2002) presented evidence that
talin, through its FERM domain, interacts with the C-terminal tail of
the 90-kD PIP5K1C (606102) isoform. DiPaolo et al. (2002) determined
that, in rat brain, the predominant talin that interacts with PIP5K1C is
Tln2. The authors showed that this interaction induces clustering of
PIP5D1C and talin at focal adhesions and increases the local production
of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Monkley et al. (2001) determined that the TLN2 gene contains 55 exons
and spans about 190 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the TLN2 gene
to chromosome 15. By genomic sequence analysis, Monkley et al. (2001)
mapped the TLN2 gene to chromosome 15q15-q21.

603601	TITLE *603601 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE, CLASS 2, ALPHA; PIK3C2A
;;C2-CONTAINING PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL KINASE; CPK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate the 3-prime OH
position of the inositol ring of inositol lipids. See 602838.

CLONING

Molz et al. (1996) cloned Drosophila and mouse homologs of a novel PI3K
that they termed Cpk. Cpk contains a C-terminal calcium-binding and
phospholipid-binding module known as the C2 domain. Domin et al. (1997)
cloned human PI3KC2-alpha, the human ortholog of Cpk. The cDNA sequence
predicts a 1,686-amino acid protein that is 90% identical to mouse Cpk.
Northern blot analysis revealed that PIK3C2A is expressed as an 8-kb
mRNA in a wide variety of tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Domin et al. (1997) determined that the PIK3C2A enzyme can phosphorylate
phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate in vitro.

Posor et al. (2013) showed that formation of
phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) by PI3KC2A
spatiotemporally controls clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Depletion of
PI(3,4)P2 or PI3KC2A impairs the maturation of late-stage
clathrin-coated pits before fission. Timed formation of PI(3,4)P2 by
PI3KC2A is required for selective enrichment of the BAR domain protein
SNX9 (605952) at late-stage endocytic intermediates. Posor et al. (2013)
concluded that their findings provided a mechanistic framework for the
role of PI(3,4)P2 in endocytosis and unraveled a novel discrete function
of PI(3,4)P2 in the central cell physiologic process of
clatherin-mediated endocytosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis, Caldwell et al. (2001) determined that the PIK3C2A
gene contains 32 exons and spans approximately 76 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Caldwell et al. (2001) identified the PIK3C2A
sequence on chromosome 11p15.1-p14.

610716	TITLE *610716 TIMELESS-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TIPIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Timeless (TIM; 603887) in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a mouse
embryo cDNA library, Gotter (2003) cloned Tipin. By EST database
analysis and RT-PCR of brain mRNA, he cloned full-length human TIPIN.
The deduced 301-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
34.5 kD. It shares 72% amino acid identity with mouse Tipin, with the
greatest divergence in the C termini. Northern blot analysis of mouse
embryos detected highest Tipin levels between embryonic days 11 and 15.
In situ hybridization showed coexpression of Tim and Tipin in early
embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, although Tipin was more widely
expressed. After embryonic day 14.5, both Tim and Tipin were abundantly
expressed in thymus, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and ventricular zone
of brain, and Tipin was also expressed in lung. In adult mouse brain,
Tipin was expressed in thalamic and cortical regions, with lower
expression in suprachiasmatic nuclei.

By Western blot analysis of HeLa cells, Chou and Elledge (2006) found
that TIPIN had an apparent molecular mass of 48 kD. Immunofluorescence
localization detected TIPIN in HeLa cell nuclei. TIPIN colocalized with
chromatin and was excluded from the nucleolus.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Gotter (2003) showed that mouse Tipin
interacted with Tim in vitro and in cultured cells. In transiently
transfected cells, Tim promoted nuclear localization of Tipin.
Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Tipin disrupted the ability
of Tim to form homomultimeric complexes, suggesting a mechanism through
which Tipin may modulate Tim function.

Chou and Elledge (2006) found that TIPIN associated with the components
of the replicative helicase (e.g., MCM7; 600592) in human cell lines and
protected cells against genotoxic agents. TIPIN was required for
efficient cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage, and depletion of
TIPIN rendered cells sensitive to ionizing radiation as well as
replication stress. Loss of TIPIN resulted in spontaneous gamma-H2AX
(601772) foci, a marker for DNA double-strand breaks. TIPIN and TIM
formed a complex that maintained the level of both proteins in cells,
and loss of either one led to loss of the other.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gotter (2003) determined that the TIPIN gene contains 8 exons and spans
20 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gotter (2003) mapped the TIPIN gene to
chromosome 15q22.31. He mapped the mouse Tipin gene to a region of
chromosome 9 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
15q22.31.

612476	TITLE *612476 BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, ATF-LIKE; BATF
;;B-CELL ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR;;
BATF1;;
SFA2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BATF is a transcription factor expressed in hematopoietic cells (Meyer
et al., 1998).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a B-cell cDNA library using the N
terminus of v-myc (190080) as bait, Dorsey et al. (1995) isolated BATF.
The 125-amino acid protein has a serine-rich N terminus and a central
basic leucine zipper (bZIP) region. Northern blot analysis revealed a
1.0-kb transcript in human lung, placenta, liver, kidney, spleen, and
peripheral blood, but not in several other tissues examined. BATF
expression was detected in colorectal carcinoma and hematopoietic tumor
cell lines, but not in lung carcinoma, HeLa, or melanoma cell lines.
Immunohistochemical and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated expression
of a nuclear BATF protein in transfected COS-1 cells.

By differential screening of an adult T-cell leukemia cell line cDNA
library to identify human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-1-induced genes,
Hasegawa et al. (1996) cloned BATF, which they termed SFA2. In addition
to leucine-rich and bZIP regions, BATF contains a potential N-terminal
casein kinase II (see 115440) phosphorylation site. Northern blot
analysis detected strong expression of BATF in both mature B and T
lymphocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro binding assays, Dorsey et al.
(1995) showed that BATF formed heterodimers with JUN (165160), JUNB
(165161), and JUND (165162). BATF did not form homodimers. EMSA analysis
showed that BATF-JUN heterodimers bound to activator protein-1 (AP1; see
165160) sites in vitro. Dorsey et al. (1995) proposed that BATF is a
tissue-specific regulator of the AP1 transcription complex.

By analyzing gene expression in sorted CD8 (see 186910)-positive T cells
specific for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423) Gag
protein from HIV-positive individuals, Quigley et al. (2010) showed that
the PD1 (PDCD1; 600244) inhibitory receptor coordinately upregulated a
program of genes in 'exhausted' CD8-positive T cells. The program
included upregulation of BATF. Enforced expression of BATF was
sufficient to impair T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion,
whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD1 inhibition. BATF silencing in T cells
from individuals with chronic viremia rescued HIV-specific T-cell
function. Quigley et al. (2010) concluded that inhibitory receptors can
cause T-cell exhaustion by upregulating genes, such as BATF, that
inhibit T-cell function and may be targets to improve T-cell immunity to
HIV.

BATF3 (612470) is required for homeostatic development of
CD8-alpha-positive classical dendritic cells that prime CD8 T-cell
responses against intracellular pathogens. Tussiwand et al. (2012)
identified an alternative, Batf3-independent pathway in mice for
CD8-alpha-positive dendritic cell development operating during infection
with intracellular pathogens and mediated by the cytokines interleukin
(IL)-12 (161560) and interferon-gamma (147570). This alternative pathway
results from molecular compensation for Batf3 provided by the related
AP1 factors Batf, which also functions in T and B cells, and Batf2
(614983) induced by cytokines in response to infection. Reciprocally,
physiologic compensation between Batf and Batf3 also occurs in T cells
for expression of IL10 (124092) and CTLA4 (123890). Compensation among
BATF factors is based on the shared capacity of their leucine zipper
domains to interact with non-AP1 factors such as IRF4 (601900) and IRF8
(601565) to mediate cooperative gene activation.

Li et al. (2012) showed that in mouse CD4+ T cells and B cells IRF4
unexpectedly can cooperate with AP1 complexes to bind to AP1-IRF4
composite (5-prime-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3-prime) motifs that they denoted as
AP1-IRF composite elements (AICEs). Moreover, BATF-JUN family protein
complexes cooperate with IRF4 in binding to AICEs in preactivated CD4+ T
cells stimulated with IL21 (605384) and in TH17 differentiated cells.
Importantly, BATF binding was diminished in Irf4-null T cells, and IRF4
binding was diminished in Batf-null T cells, consistent with functional
cooperation between these factors. Moreover, Li et al. (2012) showed
that AP1 and IRF complexes cooperatively promote transcription of the
Il10 gene, which is expressed in TH17 cells and potently regulated by
IL21. Li et al. (2012) concluded that their findings revealed that IRF4
can signal via complexes containing ETS or AP1 motifs depending on the
cellular context.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and T-helper-17 (TH17)
cells, Glasmacher et al. (2012) found that IRF4 targets sequences
enriched for activated protein-1 (AP1; 165160)-IRF composite elements
(AICEs) that are cobound by BATF, an AP1 factor required for TH17, B,
and dendritic cell differentiation. IRF4 and BATF bind cooperatively to
structurally divergent AICEs to promote gene activation and TH17
differentiation. The AICE motif directs assembly of IRF4 or IRF8 with
BATF heterodimers and is also used in TH2, B, and dendritic cells.
Glasmacher et al. (2012) concluded that this genomic regulatory element
and cognate factors appear to have evolved to integrate diverse
immunomodulatory signals.

GENE STRUCTURE

Meyer et al. (1998) determined that the BATF gene contains 3 exons and
spans approximately 17 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Meyer et al. (1998) mapped the BATF gene to chromosome
14q24.

ANIMAL MODEL

After a gene expression survey identified Batf as highly expressed in
Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells compared with naive T and B cells, Schraml et
al. (2009) generated mice lacking Batf. Batf -/- mice were fertile and
appeared healthy, with normal immune system organs and development of T
and B lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Although Batf -/- mice animals
showed normal Th1 and Th2 differentiation, Th17 conditions resulted in
reduced Il17 (see IL17A; 603149) production. Batf -/- T cells failed to
induce factors required for Th17 differentiation, such as Rorgt (RORC;
602943) and Il21 (605384), but addition of these factors did not fully
restore Il17 production. Batf -/- mice had a T-cell-intrinsic defect
preventing development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis that
was T-regulatory cell independent. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR
analyses showed that the Th17 regulatory genes Rorc, Rora (600825), Ahr
(600253), Il22 (605330), and Il17 were Batf dependent. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation and EMSA analyses revealed that Batf bound to the
proximal Il17a, Il17f (606496), Il21, and Il22 promoters, and that Batf
preferentially formed heterodimers with Junb during Th17
differentiation. Schraml et al. (2009) concluded that BATF is
selectively required for Th17, but not Th2, differentiation.

602113	TITLE *602113 MYELOID/LYMPHOID OR MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA 2; MLL2
;;ALL1-RELATED GENE; ALR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The SET domain is a motif characteristic of proteins such as human ALL1
(159555) and Drosophila 'trithorax' (trx) and is found at the C terminus
of the 2 proteins. Using the ALL1 SET domain as a probe, Prasad et al.
(1997) cloned a novel gene, which they designated ALR (ALL1-related
gene). The gene encodes a 5,262-amino acid protein containing a SET
domain, 5 PHD fingers, potential zinc fingers, and a long run of
glutamines interrupted by hydrophobic residues (mostly leucine). They
also detected an alternatively spliced form encoding 4,957 amino acids
and lacking an N-terminal zinc finger and PHD finger. Analysis of ALR
expression showed that its approximately 18-kb transcript is expressed,
like ALL1, in most adult tissues, including a variety of hematopoietic
cells, but not in liver. Whole mount in situ hybridization of early
mouse embryos indicated expression of a similar mouse gene in multiple
tissues. Based on similarities in structure and expression pattern,
Prasad et al. (1997) concluded that ALR is likely to play a role similar
to those of ALL1 and trx.

OTHER FEATURES

By database searching, Karlin et al. (2002) identified 192 human protein
sequences that have multiple amino acid runs, many of which are
associated with disease, including cancer. Karlin et al. (2002) found
that a key aspect of 82 of these protein sequences is their role in
transcription, translation, and developmental regulation. MLL2 is a
striking example with 24 amino acid runs, all but 2 of which are
glutamine runs. Karlin et al. (2002) concluded that genes encoding a
significant number of long amino acid runs are potentially associated
with disease.

MAPPING

By analysis of rodent/human hybrid cells and analysis of the Genebridge
radiation hybrid panel, Prasad et al. (1997) mapped the ALR gene to the
12p13.1-qter region and within a 13-cR chromosome region corresponding
to a physical size of approximately 340 kb near D12S1401. Based on
information from 3 databases, they placed ALR between vitamin D receptor
(601769) at 12q12-q14 and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (138420),
which is located in the same region. Prasad et al. (1997) noted that the
12q12-q13 region is involved in duplications and translocations
associated with cancer.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Kabuki Syndrome 1

Ng et al. (2010) performed the exome sequencing of 10 unrelated patients
with Kabuki syndrome (KABUK1; 147920), 7 of European ancestry, 2 of
Hispanic ancestry and 1 of mixed European and Haitian ancestry, and
identified nonsense or frameshift mutations in the MLL2 gene in 7
patients. Follow-up Sanger sequencing detected MLL2 mutations in 2 of
the 3 remaining individuals with Kabuki syndrome and in 26 of 43
additional cases. In all, they identified 33 distinct MLL2 mutations in
35 of 53 families (66%) with Kabuki syndrome (see, e.g.,
602113.0001-602113.0004). In each of 12 cases for which DNA from both
parents was available, the MLL2 variant was found to have occurred de
novo. MLL2 mutations were also identified in each of 2 families in which
Kabuki syndrome was transmitted from parent to child. None of the
additional MLL2 mutations was found in 190 control chromosomes from
individuals of matched geographic ancestry. Ng et al. (2010) suggested
that mutations in MLL2 are a major cause of Kabuki syndrome.

Hannibal et al. (2011) identified 70 mutations in the MLL2 gene in 81
(74%) of 110 kindreds with Kabuki syndrome. In simplex cases for which
DNA was available from both parents, 25 mutations were confirmed to be
de novo, whereas a transmitted mutation was found in 2 of 3 familial
cases. Most of the variants were nonsense or frameshift mutations
predicted to result in haploinsufficiency. Mutations occurred throughout
the gene, but were particularly common in exons 39 and 48. The clinical
features of those with or without mutations were similar, except for
renal anomalies, which occurred in 47% of mutation carriers compared to
14% of those who did not have a mutation.

Li et al. (2011) sequenced all 54 coding exons of the MLL2 gene in 34
patients with Kabuki syndrome and identified 18 distinct mutations in 19
patients, 11 of 12 tested de novo. Mutations were located throughout the
gene and included 3 nonsense mutations, 2 splice site mutations, 6 small
deletions or insertions, and 7 missense mutations. Li et al. (2011)
compared frequencies of clinical symptoms in MLL2 mutation carriers
versus noncarriers. MLL2 mutation carriers more often presented with
short stature and renal anomalies (p = 0.026 and 0.031, respectively),
and in addition, MLL2 showed a more typical facial gestalt (17 of 19)
compared with noncarriers (9 of 15), although this result was not
statistically significant (p = 0.1). Mutation-negative patients were
subsequently tested for mutations in 10 functional candidate genes, but
no convincing causative mutations could be identified. Li et al. (2011)
concluded that MLL2 is the major gene for Kabuki syndrome with a wide
spectrum of de novo mutations but that there is further genetic
heterogeneity accounting for MLL2 mutation-negative patients.

Banka et al. (2012) analyzed the MLL2 gene in a cohort of 116 patients
with Kabuki syndrome, including 18 patients previously reported by
Hannibal et al. (2011), and identified MLL2 variants in 74 (63.8%).
Banka et al. (2012) stated that 170 (73.2%) of 232 published MLL2
mutation-positive kabuki syndrome patients had truncating mutations.
They also noted that pathogenic missense mutations were commonly located
in exon 48.

- Somatic Mutations

Parsons et al. (2011) identified inactivating mutations in the MLL2 gene
in approximately 10% of sequenced medulloblastomas from children.

Morin et al. (2011) found that somatic mutations in MLL2 were present in
32% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 89% of follicular lymphoma
cases.

609130	TITLE *609130 APOPTOSIS-INDUCING, TAF9-LIKE DOMAIN 1; APITD1
;;CENTROMERIC PROTEIN S; CENPS;;
FANCM-INTERACTING HISTONE-FOLD PROTEIN 1; MHF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fanconi anemia (FA) nuclear core complex (see 607139) is required
for DNA damage response and repair. STRA13 (615128) and APITD1 form a
heterodimeric DNA-remodeling complex that interacts with the FA complex
component FANCM (609644) to facilitate repair of branched DNA (Yan et
al., 2010; Singh et al., 2010).

CLONING

Using in silico mapping methods, Krona et al. (2004) identified 2
alternatively spliced transcripts of a novel gene, designated APITD1,
within a 500-kb neuroblastoma tumor suppressor candidate region on
chromosome 1p36.22. Transcript A encodes a deduced 138-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 16 kD, and transcript B
encodes a deduced 99-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass
of 11 kD. Both proteins contain a TAF9 (313650)-like domain. Northern
blot analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines detected ubiquitous expression
of a major, approximately 1.5 kb and a minor, less than 1 kb transcript.
Expression of transcript A was generally higher in fetal tissues,
whereas that of transcript B was higher in adult tissues. Expression of
both was significantly reduced in several primary neuroblastoma tumors
and in tumors of varied tissue origin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krona et al. (2004) determined that the APITD1 gene contains 6 exons,
including alternative exons 1A and 1B, and spans about 13 kb. Both exons
1A and 1B are preceded by a CpG island.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids, Krona et al. (2004)
mapped the APITD1 gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis,
they refined the location of the gene to 1p36.22, in a head-to-tail
orientation between the PGD (172200) and CORT (602784) genes.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of CENPA (117139)-containing complexes from HeLa
cells, followed by multiple tandem affinity purifications, Foltz et al.
(2006) identified CENPS associated with CENPM (610152) and CENPU
(MLF1IP; 611511) but not directly associated with the CENPA
nucleosome-associated complex.

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis of chicken DT40 cells, Amano et al.
(2009) found that Cenps interacted with Cenpx (STRA13), but not with
other centromeric proteins, in a centromeric protein subcomplex. Cenps
-/- and Cenpx -/- DT40 cells showed slow mitotic progression and
increased numbers of apoptotic cells. Knockdown of CENPS and CENPX in
HeLa cells via small interfering RNA caused more severe mitotic defects,
including misaligned chromosomes. Knockdown of CENPX in DT40 and HeLa
cells eliminated kinetochore localization of CENPS. Knockout of Cenps
and Cenpx reduced localization of the outer kinetochore proteins Ndc80
(607272) and Knl1 (CASC5; 609173) and increased intrakinetochore
distance in the absence of tension. Amano et al. (2009) proposed that
the CENPS-CENPX subcomplex is essential for stable assembly of outer
kinetochore proteins.

Yan et al. (2010) and Singh et al. (2010) independently found that
APITD1 and STRA13, which they called MHF1 and MHF2, were associated with
a high-molecular-mass complex containing FA complex components and Bloom
syndrome complex components (e.g., RECQL3; 604610). MHF1 and MHF2 also
associated in a much smaller complex distinct from the FA core complex.
Coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses confirmed direct
interaction between MHF1 and MHF2. MHF1 and MHF2 appeared to associate
predominantly with FANCM and FAAP24 (C19ORF40; 610884), but not with
other FA complex components. MHF1 mediated interaction of the MHF1-MHF2
heterodimer with FANCM. The MHF1-MHF2 heterodimer, but not either
component alone, also bound several types of branched DNA and enhanced
FANCM binding to branched DNA. HeLa cells depleted of either MHF protein
displayed reduced monoubiquitination and foci formation by FANCD2
(613984) in response to DNA damage. Depletion of the MHF proteins also
resulted in hypersensitivity of cells to DNA-damaging agents. Yan et al.
(2010) found that FANCM and the MHF proteins were recruited to DNA
interstrand crosslinks during S phase, apparently stimulated by DNA
replication. Using a DNA branch migration assay, Singh et al. (2010)
found that the MHF1-MHF2 dimer itself was devoid of activity, but that
it enhanced FANCM-dependent DNA branch migration. Yan et al. (2010) and
Singh et al. (2010) concluded that the MHF1-MHF2 heterodimer is required
for normal activation of the FA pathway in response to DNA damage.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Krona et al. (2004) performed genomic sequence analysis of the APITD1
gene in 44 neuroblastoma tumors and identified no loss-of-function
mutations, indicating that the gene is not a common abnormality of such
tumors.

603320	TITLE *603320 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 23A; MMP23A
;;MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 21, FORMERLY; MMP21, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The matrix metalloproteinases are secreted glycoproteins that are
involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. By analysis of
the genomic region surrounding the duplicated genes CDC2L1 (176873) and
CDC2L2 (116951), Gururajan et al. (1998) identified 2 novel matrix
metalloproteinase genes, MMP23A, which they called MMP21, and MMP23B
(603321), which they called MMP22. The nucleotide sequences of MMP21 and
MMP22 are nearly identical. Using a combination of techniques, the
authors isolated cDNAs corresponding to alternatively spliced
transcripts that encode 3 protein isoforms, MMP21/22A, MMP21/22B, and
MMP21/22C. The MMP21 and MMP22 proteins contain prepro-, catalytic,
cysteine-rich, IL1R (147810)-related, and proline-rich domains. Northern
blot analysis revealed that a 1.4-kb MMP21/22 transcript was expressed
in heart, placenta, ovary, testis, and prostate. A 0.8-kb mRNA was
detected in heart and pancreas, and an additional 2.4-kb mRNA was
detected in ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gururajan et al. (1998) determined that the MMP21 and MMP22 genes
contain 8 exons each, and the exons generally correspond to the
structural domains of the putative protein products.

MAPPING

Gururajan et al. (1998) reported that the MMP21 and MMP22 genes are
located within an approximately 140-kb region on chromosome 1p36.3. This
region consists of 2 identical genomic segments, each of which contains
a CDC2L gene linked to an MMP gene. The 3-prime end of the MMP gene is
500 to 800 bp from the 3-prime end of the adjacent CDC2L gene. The genes
are arranged in the order
telomere--MMP22--CDC2L2--CDC2L1--MMP21--centromere. The 2 CDC2L genes
are separated by approximately 50 kb. Gururajan et al. (1998) stated
that although the functional significance of the reiteration of selected
genes within the 1p36.3 region is not known, it might reflect
instability relevant to the observed deletion of 1p36 during
tumorigenesis.

600178	TITLE *600178 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1A; MAP1A
;;MTAP1A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The assembly of microtubules, an essential step in neurogenesis, is
modulated by a family of molecules called microtubule-associated
proteins (MAPs). These proteins have been divided into 2 main groups by
molecular mass, high molecular weight MAPs, which include MAP1A, MAP1B
(157129), and MAP2 (157130), and another group of intermediate-sized
proteins, which include the abundant tau MAPs. MAP1B, also named MAP5,
is a component of long cross-bridges between microtubules and is a
filamentous molecule with a small spherical segment at one end.

Langkopf et al. (1992) determined the deduced amino acid sequence for
the MAP1A heavy chain from a series of overlapping cDNA clones. The cDNA
encoding MAP1A also encodes one of the MAP1A heavy chain's associated
light chains, LC2.

Lien et al. (1994) completely cloned and sequenced the human MAP1B gene.
By comparison of human MAP1B with sequence databases, they identified a
MAP1B-related gene that is probably the human homolog of rat MAP1A. The
human MAP1A gene is expressed at high levels in brain and spinal cord
and at much lower levels in muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

The MAP1A/LC2 gene is organized in a similar fashion to that of the gene
encoding both MAP1B and LC1 (Hammarback et al., 1991). The encoded
precursor polypeptide presumably undergoes proteolytic processing to
generate the final MAP1A heavy chain and LC2 polypeptides. Fink et al.
(1996) showed that the MAP1A gene contains 5 exons and spans about 10.5
kb. The predicted human and rat proteins are remarkably similar.

MAPPING

Lien et al. (1994) mapped the MAP1A gene to 15q by PCR amplification of
genomic DNA purified from somatic cell hybrid lines and further
sublocalized it using a deletion panel from chromosome 15, 15q13-qter.

GENE FUNCTION

Ikeda et al. (2002) identified the MAP1A gene as the 'modifier of tubby
hearing-1' (moth1) QTL associated with hearing loss in tubby mutants on
the C57BL/6J background. The Map1a cDNA derived from B6 contained 12
single-nucleotide differences which could lead to amino acid alterations
and a difference in the length of a repeat in the open reading frame
when compared with that found in the AKR strain. Ikeda et al. (2002)
used a transgenic rescue experiment to verify that sequence
polymorphisms were crucial for hearing loss phenotype and demonstrated
that the polymorphisms changed the binding efficiency of MAP1A to PSD95
(602887), a core component in the cytoarchitecture of synapses. This
indicates that at least some of the observed polymorphisms are
functionally important and that the hearing loss of C57BL/6J-tub/tub
mice may be caused by impaired protein interactions involving MTAP1A.

601783	TITLE *601783 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 6; MAP6
;;MTAP6;;
STABLE TUBULE-ONLY POLYPEPTIDE; STOP;;
KIAA1878
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mammalian cells often contain abundant subpopulations of microtubules
that are stable to both drug- and cold temperature-induced disassembly.
Such microtubules are apparently universal in the neurite extensions of
neuronal cells. Bosc et al. (1996) cloned and characterized the gene
encoding a rat protein that reconstitutes microtubule cold stability in
vitro. The protein, called stable tubule-only polypeptide (STOP) by
them, is a 100.5-kD polypeptide. The central region of the predicted
952-amino acid polypeptide contains 5 tandem repeats of 46 amino acids.
STOP also contains a putative SH3-binding motif near its N terminus.

Denarier et al. (1998) determined that the deduced mouse Map6 protein
contains 906 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of about
96.4 kD.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult hippocampus
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned MAP6, which they designated
KIAA1878. The transcript contains a repetitive element in the 3-prime
UTR. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest MAP6 expression in fetal brain,
followed by spinal cord, adult brain, testis, kidney, lung, heart, and
ovary. Lower expression was detected in pancreas, spleen, and skeletal
muscle, and little to no expression was detected in adult and fetal
liver. All specific brain regions showed intermediate to high
expression, with highest expression in caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and
cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

Bosc et al. (1996) found that in vitro-translated STOP bound to
microtubules and calmodulin (114180). When STOP cDNA was expressed in
HeLa cells, which lack cold-stable microtubules, the protein product
associated with microtubules at 37 degrees C and stabilized microtubule
networks, which induced cold stability, nocodazole resistance, and
tubulin detyrosination.

GENE STRUCTURE

Denarier et al. (1998) determined that the mouse Map6 gene contains 4
exons and spans about 40 kb. The 5-prime flanking region lacks a TATA
box or an initiator element.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the MAP6 gene
to chromosome 11. Jolly et al. (1999) reported a conflicting assignment
of the human MAP6 gene to chromosome 6p12-p11 by FISH. However, Andrieux
et al. (2002) confirmed that the human MAP6 gene maps to chromosome
11q14.

Using FISH, Denarier et al. (1998) mapped the mouse Map6 gene to region
E2-F1 of chromosome 7, which shows homology of synteny to human
chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Andrieux et al. (2002) found that Stop-null mice had no detectable
defects in brain anatomy, but they showed synaptic defects, with
depleted synaptic vesicle pools and impaired synaptic plasticity,
associated with severe behavioral disorders. A survey of the effects of
psychotropic drugs on the behavior of Stop-null mice showed a specific
effect of long-term administration of neuroleptics in alleviating these
disorders.

605975	TITLE *605975 SERINE/ARGININE REPETITIVE MATRIX PROTEIN 1; SRRM1
;;SERINE/ARGININE-RICH SPLICING FACTOR-RELATED NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEIN,
160-KD;;
SR-RELATED NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEIN, 160-KD; SRM160
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pre-mRNA synthesis and processing involves factors widely distributed
throughout the nucleus, with concentrations in 2 types of foci, speckles
and coiled bodies. A subset of splicing factors in speckles is
associated with the nuclear matrix. One of these, SRM160, forms a
complex with SRM300 (606032) that functions as a pre-mRNA-specific
splicing coordinator (Blencowe et al., 1998).

For background information on the SR family of serine/arginine-rich
splicing factors, see 600812.

CLONING

By biochemical purification, micropeptide sequence analysis, EST
database searching, and screening a monocytoid cDNA library, Blencowe et
al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding SRM160 (SR-related matrix protein of
160 kD) and several isoforms. The deduced 820-amino acid protein is rich
in SR/RS repeats and proline residues. SRM160 also has multiple putative
phosphorylation sites and SH3-binding motifs but no RNA-recognition
domains. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a ubiquitous,
variably expressed 3.8-kb transcript and a more restricted 6.0-kb
transcript. Immunoblot analysis showed that the recombinant protein was
expressed as a 160-kD protein in nuclear extract and that it could be
reduced to a 120-kD protein by phosphatase treatment. Confocal
microscopy demonstrated expression of SRM160 in nuclear speckles.
Immunoprecipitation analysis detected interaction of SRM160 with SRM300
(606032), a nuclear matrix antigen, and 2 other SR proteins, SRp40
(600914) and SRp75 (601940). EMSA analysis indicated that SRM160/SRM300
associates with pre-mRNA and promotes splicing through interactions with
SR family proteins. The association between SRM160/SRM300 and pre-mRNA
is dependent on RNU1 (180680) and is stabilized by RNU2 (180690).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SRM160
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP RH40469).

150150	TITLE *150150 LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE C; LDHC
;;LDH, TESTICULAR FORM; LDHX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinkham et al. (1964) found a distinctive LDH isozyme in mature testes
of many species including man. It is polymorphic in the pigeon, and one
can infer that a locus separate from LDHA (150000) and LDHB (150100)
controls it. The same is almost certainly true in the human. This is a
gene that functions only in one sex and only in one tissue.

Sakai et al. (1987) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones of LDHC from the
mouse. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)-containing RNAs from mouse
testes and liver indicated that the Ldhc gene was expressed in testes
but not in liver. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of mouse Ldhc
showed 73 and 72% homology, respectively, with those of mouse Ldha.
Southern blot analysis of genomic DNAs from mouse liver and human
placenta indicated the presence of multiple LDH-C gene-related
sequences. From the amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA, Millan et al.
(1987) found that human LDHC is as different from rodent Ldhc (73%
homology) as it is from human LDHA (76% homology) and porcine LDHB (68%
homology).

MAPPING

Zinkham et al. (1969) found that the LDHB and LDHC loci are closely
linked in pigeons. Edwards et al. (1987) used an LDHC cDNA to analyze
genomic DNA from rodent/human somatic cell hybrids. These showed that
LDHA and LDHC are syntenic on human chromosome 11. The assignment of
LDHC was confirmed by Kao et al. (1988), who localized the gene to
11p15.5-p14.3 by use of somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosome
hybridization. Li et al. (1988) also assigned LDHC to chromosome 11 by
hybridization of DNA from flow-sorted chromosomes. The close physical
proximity of the LDHC and LDHA genes supports the evolutionary
relatedness of the 2 isozymes. Edwards et al. (1989) reported mapping of
LDHC to 11p15.5-p15.3 by combination of somatic cell hybrid studies and
in situ hybridization.

614235	TITLE *614235 PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 8; PDZD8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PDZD8 is a cytoskeletal regulatory protein that interacts with moesin
(MSN; 309845) and regulates stable microtubule abundance. Both MSN and
PDZD8 suppress herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection, but PDZD8 also
promotes human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 infection (see 609423) (Henning
et al., 2010, 2011).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human testis cDNA library with HIV-1
Gag as bait, Henning et al. (2010) cloned PDZD8. The predicted
1,154-amino acid protein contains a PDZ domain, a zinc finger domain,
and a coiled-coil motif.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid screening, Henning et al. (2010) showed that PDZD8
amino acids 932 to 1119, including the coiled-coil motif, interacted
with HIV-1 Gag amino acids 59 to 250. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis
confirmed the interaction. Overexpression of PDZD8 in human cells
promoted initiation of retroviral transcription and HIV-1 infection,
whereas knockdown of PDZD8 decreased HIV-1 infection. A PDZD8 mutant
lacking the coiled-coil domain failed to bind Gag and promote HIV-1
infection.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Henning
et al. (2011) found that amino acids 990 to 1155 of human PDZD8
interacted with amino acids 158 to 279 of moesin. Expression of PDZD8 or
moesin reduced the levels of stable microtubules in the human CHME3
microglial cell line. In addition, expression of PDZD8 or moesin reduced
the cytopathic effects of HSV-1, as well as HSV-1 replication and
spread, in CHME3 cells.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the PDZD8 gene to chromosome 10q25.3-q26.11 based on
an alignment of the PDZD8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC028375) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611007	TITLE *611007 MEX3, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A; MEX3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

C. elegans Mex3 is a regulator of translation that specifies posterior
blastomere identity in the early embryo and contributes to the
maintenance of germline totipotency. By database analysis and RT-PCR,
Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) cloned a family of 4 human genes homologous
to C. elegans Mex3, including MEX3A. Like the other human MEX3 proteins,
the deduced 520-amino acid MEX3A protein has an N-terminal nuclear
export signal (NES), 2 heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K
(HNRNPK; 600712) homology (KH) domains, and a C-terminal RING finger
domain. The KH domains are present in C. elegans Mex3, but not the RING
domain. RT-PCR detected variable expression of MEX3A in human tissues
and cell lines, with highest levels in fetal brain and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Western blot analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney cells
and kinase assays, Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) showed that MEX3A, MEX3B
(611008), and MEX3C (611005) were phosphoproteins. RNA
homopolymer-binding assays and immunoprecipitation analysis revealed
that MEX3A, MEX3B, and MEX3C bound RNA via their KH domains in vitro and
in vivo. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected breast cancer cells
showed that MEX3A, MEX3B, and MEX3C shuttled between the nucleus and
cytoplasm in an NES-dependent manner. MEX3A and MEX3B colocalized with
DCP1A (607010) decapping factor and argonaute proteins (e.g., AGO1;
606228) in processing (P) bodies, which are centers for mRNA turnover.
Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) proposed that MEX3 proteins may function in
maintenance of pluripotent cells, i.e., stem cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) determined that the MEX3A gene contains 2
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Buchet-Poyau et al. (2007) mapped the
MEX3A gene to chromosome 1q22.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shirasu et al. (1999) cloned the cDNA of a human gene, designated CHP1,
that encodes a 332-amino acid protein containing 2 CHORD domains. CHORD
was defined as a 60-amino acid, cysteine- and histidine-rich,
Zn(2+)-binding domain that is conserved in tandem organization in
protozoa, plants, and metazoa.

GENE FUNCTION

Shirasu et al. (1999) found that silencing of the C. elegans
CHORD-containing gene, chp, resulted in semisterility and embryo
lethality, suggesting an essential function of the wildtype gene in
nematode development.

613137	TITLE *613137 TETRASPANIN 9; TSPAN9
;;NEW EST TETRASPAN 5; NET5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the tetraspanin superfamily, such as TSPAN9, are
characterized by the presence of 4 transmembrane domains. Tetraspanins
associate in large membrane complexes with other molecules, particularly
integrins (see ITGB1; 135630), and function in cell adhesion, migration,
and signaling (summary by Serru et al., 2000).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for tetraspanin-like sequences, followed by
5-prime RACE of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Serru et al. (2000) cloned
TSPAN9, which they called NET5. The deduced 239-amino acid protein
contains 4 transmembrane segments and other characteristics of a
tetraspanin. RT-PCR detected TSPAN9 expression in all human cell lines
examined.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TSPAN9 gene to chromosome 12p13.32 based on an
alignment of the TSPAN9 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF217967) with the

;;CAS-INTERACTING ZINC FINGER PROTEIN; CIZ;;
CAGH1;;
NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEIN 4; NMP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF384 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that localizes at
fibroblast focal adhesions, contains multiple zinc fingers, and
regulates expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., MMP3; 185250)
(Thunyakitpisal et al., 2001).

CLONING

By screening adult and fetal human brain cDNA libraries for clones
containing CAG repeats, Margolis et al. (1997) isolated a partial cDNA
encoding ZNF384, which they called CAGH1.

By Far Western screening of a rat embryonic fibroblast cDNA library with
the SH3 domain of Cas (BCAR1; 602941) as probe, Nakamoto et al. (2000)
isolated several splice variants of Znf384, which they called Ciz. The
longest variant encodes a predicted 579-residue protein with an
N-terminal leucine zipper, multiple serine and proline residues, a
nuclear localization signal, 8 centrally located Kruppel-type C2H2 zinc
fingers, and C-terminal glutamine-alanine and glutamine repeat regions,
suggesting that Ciz may be a transcription factor. The shorter variants
encode proteins with only 5 or 6 zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis of
rat tissues revealed ubiquitous expression of a 3.0-kb transcript, with
highest levels in testis, heart, kidney, and brain. A 4.0-kb transcript
was also detected in brain, liver, and kidney. Immunofluorescence
microscopy showed that Ciz shuttled in and out of the nucleus and
localized at stably formed focal adhesions and in the nucleus.

Thunyakitpisal et al. (2001) independently cloned and characterized rat
Znf384, which they termed Nmp4, based on its interaction with type I
collagen alpha-1 (COL1A1; 120150). They identified several novel
variants, including one that lacks the C-terminal glutamine-alanine
repeat region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using precipitation analysis, Nakamoto et al. (2000) showed that rat Ciz
bound specifically and constitutively to the SH3 domain of Cas.
Immunoprecipitation and EMSA analysis demonstrated that Ciz bound to the
promoter of human MMP1 (120353) and upregulated transcription of human
MMP1 and MMP7 (178990) and rat Mmp3.

Thunyakitpisal et al. (2001) showed that rat Nmp4 interacted with Col1a1
and regulated its expression in osteoblasts. They concluded that NMP4
contributes to extracellular matrix turnover in bone and other tissues.

Shen et al. (2002) overexpressed Ciz in a mouse osteoblast cell line and
found that it inhibited Bmp2 (112261)-induced expression of alkaline
phosphatase (see ALPL; 171760), osteocalcin (BGLAP; 112260), type I
collagen, and Cbfa1 (RUNX2; 600211). They concluded that CIZ is an
inhibitory protein that modulates BMP2-induced differentiation of
osteoblastic cells.

MAPPING

Margolis et al. (1997) stated that the ZFN384 gene maps to chromosome
12p12. Alvarez et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Znf384 gene to chromosome
6F1, a region that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 12p12.

ANIMAL MODEL

Morinobu et al. (2005) found that Ciz -/- mice had increased bone volume
and rates of bone formation, but no alteration in bone resorption. Ciz
-/- mice expressed higher levels of mRNA for proteins involved in
osteoblastic phenotypes, such as alkaline phosphatase and osterix (SP7;
606633). Ciz deficiency increased newly formed bone mass after femoral
bone marrow ablation, and it increased Bmp2-induced bone formation in
adult mouse calvariae. Morinobu et al. (2005) concluded that CIZ
suppresses the levels of adult bone mass through inhibition of
BMP-induced activation of osteoblasts.

604602	TITLE *604602 RIBOSOME-RECYCLING FACTOR, MITOCHONDRIAL; MRRF
;;RRF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The termination of protein synthesis requires the action of several
auxiliary factors. In bacteria, ribosome-recycling factor (Rrf) is
essential for the release of ribosomes from the mRNA at the stop codon.
Mitochondria perform protein synthesis using a translation system that
has some features reminiscent of prokaryotic translation and other
features that are unique. By searching an EST database using the E. coli
Rrf protein sequence as the query, Zhang and Spremulli (1998) identified
human ESTs encoding mitochondrial ribosome-recycling factor (MRRF). They
assembled the complete MRRF coding sequence using ESTs. Sequence
analysis of the deduced 263-amino acid MRRF protein indicated that it is
likely localized in the mitochondria; however, MRRF does not have a
clear cleavage signal for removal of the signal peptide. Human MRRF
shares approximately 25 to 30% amino acid sequence identity with
bacterial RRFs.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro assays with recombinant human proteins, Tsuboi et al.
(2009) showed that RRF interacted directly with EFG2 (GFM2; 606544) and
that both were required for ribosome dissociation from mRNA. GTP, but
not GTP hydrolysis, was also required. GTP hydrolysis by EFG2 appeared
to follow the ribosome splitting reaction and occurred on the ribosomal
large subunit. EFG2 and RRF remained on the large subunit until GTP was
hydrolyzed and prevented reassociation of subunits.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hansen et al. (2000) assigned the MRRF
gene to chromosome 9q32-q34.1.

609737	TITLE *609737 CRUMBS, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; CRB3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching for mammalian Crumbs family members (see CRB1,
604210), Makarova et al. (2003) identified and subsequently cloned CRB3
from human retina cDNA. The CRB3 cDNA encodes a deduced 120-amino acid
protein with a putative signal peptide in the first 20 amino acids, a
putative extracellular N-glycosylation site, and a transmembrane domain.
The intracellular domain contains a conserved band-4.1
superfamily-binding site and a Pals PDZ domain-binding site, as found in
Drosophila Crumbs and human CRB1. Makarova et al. (2003) also identified
mouse Crb3. The intracellular domains of the human and mouse proteins
are highly conserved. Using RT-PCR, Makarova et al. (2003) found high
levels of CRB3 mRNA in lung, kidney, retina, colon, and mammary gland,
and moderate levels in liver, spleen, pancreas, placenta, and prostate.
By Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues, Lemmers et al.
(2004) demonstrated CRB3 expression in all epithelial tissues analyzed
and in skeletal muscle, with weak expression in brain.

GENE FUNCTION

From immunoprecipitation assays carried out with Madin Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cell lysates, Makarova et al. (2003) showed that CRB3
binds with PALS1 (MMP5; 606958) and the PALS1-associated tight junction
protein, PATJ (see 603199). The PALS1 PDZ domain was found to be
necessary for CRB3 binding. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that
CRB3 is N-glycosylated. Makarova et al. (2003) demonstrated that CRB3 is
localized to the apical surface and tight junctions of MDCK cells and
that this localization is not dependent on glycosylation.

Lemmers et al. (2004) demonstrated that the apical localization of CRB3
is not dependent on the PDZ-binding domain (ERLI). Lemmers et al. (2004)
found that expression of CRB3 or of a chimera containing the
extracellular domain of the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (NGFR; 162010)
and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CRB3 led to a slower
development of functional tight junctions in MDCK cells. This phenotype
relied on the presence of the CRB3 PDZ-binding domain, which is involved
in a direct interaction with PAR6-alpha (PARD6A; 607484), a regulator of
epithelial polarity and tight junction formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lemmers et al. (2004) determined that the CRB3 gene contains 4 exons,
with the last exon containing the 3-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CRB3
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP STS-N23258).

613497	TITLE *613497 LIPASE A, LYSOSOMAL ACID; LIPA
;;LYSOSOMAL ACID LIPASE; LAL;;
CHOLESTEROL ESTER HYDROLASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Anderson and Sando (1991) reported that the amino acid sequence of LAL
as deduced from the 2.6-kb cDNA nucleotide sequence is 58% identical to
that of human gastric lipase (LIPF; 601980), which is involved in the
preduodenal breakdown of ingested triglycerides.

Anderson et al. (1994) isolated and sequenced the gene for LIPA.

GENE FUNCTION

The distinct kinetic and physical properties of lipases A and B (LIPB;
247980) were defined by Warner et al. (1980). They stated that the
natural substrate for LIPB was not known, and that it was not clear that
LIPB is a lysosomal hydrolase. LIPA may serve an important role in
cellular metabolism by releasing cholesterol. The liberated cholesterol
suppresses further cholesterol synthesis and stimulates esterification
of cholesterol within the cell.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aslanidis et al. (1994) summarized the exon structure of the LIPA gene,
which consists of 10 exons, together with the sizes of genomic EcoRI and
SacI fragments hybridizing to each exon. The DNA sequence of the
putative promoter region was presented.

Anderson et al. (1994) found that the LIPA gene is spread over 36 kb of
genomic DNA. The 5-prime flanking region is GC-rich and has
characteristics of a 'housekeeping' gene promoter.

MAPPING

Koch et al. (1979, 1981) assigned lysosomal acid lipase A to chromosome
10 by human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids. Judging from the close
concordance with soluble glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT1;
138180), these loci were thought to be close together on the long arm of
10. Lipase A is encoded by chromosome 19 in mouse (Koch et al., 1981).
GOT1 is also on chromosome 10q in man and 19 in mouse.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Anderson et al. (1993) mapped the
LIPA locus to 10q23.2-q.23.3. It was clearly distinct from the locus for
pancreatic lipase (246600) at 10q26.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) and Wolman disease are
autosomal recessive allelic disorders (278000) associated with reduced
activity and genetic defects of lysosomal acid lipase. Aslanidis et al.
(1996) provided evidence that the strikingly more severe course of
Wolman disease is caused by genetic defects of LAL that leave no
residual enzyme activity. In a CESD patient, a G-to-A transition at
position -1 of the exon 8 splice donor site (613497.0002) resulted in
skipping of exon 8 in 97% of the mRNA originating from this allele,
while 3% was spliced correctly, resulting in full-length LAL enzyme. Two
sibs with Wolman disease were homozygous for a splice site mutation
involving the same donor site but permitting no correct splicing or
subsequent synthesis of functional enzyme (613497.0004).

Pagani et al. (1996) described the molecular basis of CESD in 3
patients. They identified mutations by sequence analysis of LAL cDNA and
genomic DNA. The role of the mutations as the direct cause of the
disease was confirmed by measuring the LAL enzymatic activity of
extracts from cells transfected with LAL mutants. The 3 CESD patients
were found to be compound heterozygotes. Pagani et al. (1996) identified
3 different missense mutations, 2 splicing defects, and a null allele.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
WOLMAN DISEASE
CHOLESTERYL ESTER STORAGE DISEASE, INCLUDED
LIPA, LEU179PRO

In a proband with Wolman disease (278000) from a nonconsanguineous
family, Anderson et al. (1994) detected a T-to-C transition at
nucleotide 639 of the LIPA gene that resulted in a nonconservative
missense mutation, leu179 to pro (L179P). This mutation was found in
compound heterozygosity with a single-base insertion resulting in a null
allele (613497.0004). The proband had had 2 older sibs with Wolman
disease. Anderson et al. (1994) noted that the L179P mutation is located
26 amino acids from the predicted active site of lysosomal acid lipase
and was expected to disrupt the alpha-helical structure in a highly
conserved region of the protein.

Maslen and Illingworth (1993) and Maslen et al. (1995) found the L179P
mutation in 2 sibs with cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD). In
these sibs the L179P mutation, inherited from the mother, was found in
compound heterozygosity with a splice site mutation that resulted in
skipping of exon 8 of lysosomal acid lipase (613497.0002). Maslen et al.
(1995) compared the phenotypes of other patients carrying the L179P or
the splice site mutation described by them and concluded that the L179P
mutant allele apparently does not make a substantial contribution to
cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity.

.0002
CHOLESTERYL ESTER STORAGE DISEASE
LIPA, 934G-A

In a 12-year-old patient with cholesteryl ester storage disease (278000)
from a nonconsanguineous Polish-German family, Klima et al. (1993)
detected a 72-bp in-frame deletion resulting in the loss of amino acid
codons 254 through 277. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed that the 72 bp
represented an exon, indicating that the deletion in the mRNA was caused
by defective splicing. Sequence analysis of the patient's genomic DNA
revealed a G-to-A substitution in the last nucleotide of the 72-bp exon
on 1 allele. No normal-sized mRNA was detectable in the propositus even
though he was not homozygous for the splice site mutation. Klima et al.
(1993) concluded that the patient was compound heterozygous for the
splice site mutation and a null allele. The patient showed LIPA activity
in cultured skin fibroblasts approximately 9% of normal.
Hepatosplenomegaly had been present since age 5 years.

Aslanidis et al. (1996) restudied the patient of Klima et al. (1993) and
defined the splice site mutation as a G-to-A mutation at position -1 of
the splice donor site following exon 8, resulting in incorrect splicing
and the removal of the 72-bp exon 8 of the LIPA gene. They determined
that the other allele of the patient carried a premature termination
mutation (613497.0003) as well as the L179P mutation (613497.0001); the
LIPA mRNA was rendered unstable by the premature stop codon. Aslanidis
et al. (1996) demonstrated that the splice site mutation allowed the
production of approximately 3 to 4% of correctly spliced mRNA relative
to wildtype. Aslanidis et al. (1996) also identified a mutation at the
same splice donor site, and also resulting in deletion of exon 8, in 2
sibs with Wolman disease; that mutation, at the +1 position, allowed no
correct splicing, and patient fibroblasts were devoid of enzymatic
activity. See 613497.0005.

In 2 sibs with CESD, Maslen and Illingworth (1993) and Maslen et al.
(1995) identified compound heterozygosity for this splice site mutation
in the LIPA gene, inherited from their father, and the L179P mutation
(613497.0001). The affected children were a sister and brother who
presented with idiopathic hepatomegaly at ages 6 and 8 years,
respectively. Subsequent analyses indicated that they also had
hypercholesterolemia and a severe reduction in cholesteryl ester
hydrolase activity in cultured fibroblasts.

Muntoni et al. (1995) observed homozygosity for the splice site mutation
(Klima et al., 1993) in a Spanish kindred with cholesterol ester storage
disease. Exon 8 of the LIPA gene was deleted.

.0003
CHOLESTERYL ESTER STORAGE DISEASE
LIPA, GLY245TER

Aslanidis et al. (1996) determined that the patient of Klima et al.
(1993) with cholesteryl ester storage disease (278000) was compound
heterozygous for a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 836 in exon 7 of
the LIPA gene, resulting in substitution of gly245 with a termination
codon (G245X), and a splice site mutation resulting in skipping of exon
8 (613497.0002). The allele carrying the G245X mutation also carried the
L179P mutation (613497.0001). Aslanidis et al. (1996) concluded that
although the L179P mutation is believed to abolish the enzymatic
activity of the lysosomal acid lipase, it is the G245X mutation, through
its production of an unstable mRNA, that was responsible for the low
level of transcript (approximately 6% of wildtype) derived from the
paternal allele.

.0004
WOLMAN DISEASE
CHOLESTERYL ESTER STORAGE DISEASE, INCLUDED
LIPA, 1-BP INS, 634T

In a proband with Wolman disease (278000), Anderson et al. (1994) found
compound heterozygosity for insertion of a T nucleotide after nucleotide
634 in exon 6 of the LIPA gene, and a substitution of proline at
leucine-179 (613497.0001). The 634T insertion occurred at the end of a
run of 6 Ts and led to premature termination 12 amino acids downstream.
Anderson et al. (1994) also found this mutation in a proband and parent
from 1 of 11 unrelated CESD families examined.

.0005
WOLMAN DISEASE
LIPA, IVS8, G-A, +1

In 2 sibs with Wolman disease (278000) from a consanguineous family,
Aslanidis et al. (1996) detected homozygosity for a G-to-A mutation at
position +1 of the splice donor site following exon 8 of the LIPA gene.
Both children died within the first year of life. The parents, who were
heterozygous for the mutation, had reduced enzymatic activity, while no
enzymatic activity was detectable in fibroblasts from the affected
children. Although the same donor splice site is involved as in the
mutation reported in CESD (934G-A, 613497.0002), the nucleotide at
position +1 was changed in the Wolman disease mutation while the
nucleotide at position -1 was changed in the CESD mutation. Both
mutations result in deletion of the same 24 amino acids (exon 8), but
the effects are dramatically different: the -1 mutation allowed some
correct splicing (3% of total LIPA RNA), but the +1 splice site
mutation, which affects one of the invariable nucleotides of the splice
consensus sequences, permits no correct splicing. Aslanidis et al.
(1996) suggested that the residual activity in CESD patients compared to
Wolman patients may result either from a partially active enzyme with
the internal deletion of 24 amino acids (skipping of exon 8) or from the
production of low amounts of the full size of the protein due to
inefficient exon exclusion from the mutated allele.

.0006
WOLMAN DISEASE
LIPA, TYR22TER

In a Japanese patient with Wolman disease (278000), Fujiyama et al.
(1996) identified a tyr22-to-ter (Y22X) mutation of the LIPA gene. The
female patient had an umbilical cord herniation at birth. At about 30
days after birth, she showed abdominal distention with
hepatosplenomegaly and frequent episodes of diarrhea and vomiting.
Abdominal computed tomography revealed massive hepatosplenomegaly and
enlargement of the adrenal glands with calcification. Anemia and hepatic
failure progressed rapidly and she died at age 114 days. The parents
were first cousins. An older sister had died with similar symptoms 80
days after birth.

.0007
WOLMAN DISEASE
LIPA, 1-BP DEL, 482A

In an infant, born of unrelated parents, with Wolman disease (278000),
Lee et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (482delA) in
exon 5 of the LIPA gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature
truncation at residue 179. The mutation, which was inherited from the
unaffected father, was not found in 200 controls chromosomes. The other
allele, inherited from the unaffected mother, carried an intragenic
deletion of the LIPA gene including intron 3 and part of exon 4; both
the patient and mother had only 1 copy of exon 4. The patient presented
at age 6 weeks with abdominal distention and failure to thrive. He had
hepatosplenomegaly and calcified adrenals; LIPA activity was
undetectable. He died of multiorgan failure within the following month.

606523	TITLE *606523 SLIT-ROBO RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 1; SRGAP1
;;SLIT-ROBO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN, RHO, 1;;
SLIT-ROBO GAP1;;
KIAA1304;;
ARHGAP13
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening brain cDNA libraries for sequences with the potential to
encode large proteins, Nagase et al. (2000) identified a cDNA they
called KIAA1304. The 1,051-amino acid KIAA1304 protein is 48% identical
to C1 RHOGAP (300023) and 68% identical to KIAA0456 (606524). It was
predicted to be involved in cell signaling/communication. RT-PCR
analysis detected moderate expression of KIAA1304 in all tissues tested
except skeletal muscle, pancreas, and spleen, where expression was low.
KIAA1304 was expressed in all brain regions tested.

The SLIT proteins (e.g., SLIT1; 603742) guide neuronal and leukocyte
migration through the Roundabout transmembrane receptors (e.g., ROBO1;
602430). Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to search for proteins
interacting with a C-terminal region (amino acids 1455 to 1657) of rat
Robo1, Wong et al. (2001) isolated 20 positive clones from a mouse brain
cDNA library. Eight of these clones encode a novel family of Rho
GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that the authors termed SRGAPs. The
mouse Srgap1, Srgap2, and Srgap3 proteins correspond to the human
KIAA1304, KIAA0456, and KIAA0411 (606525) proteins, respectively. The
SRGAPs contain an FCH domain, a RHOGAP domain, and an SH3 domain. The
FCH domain in SRGAP1 (amino acids 11 to 110) is similar to the FCH
domains of SRGAP2, SRGAP3, C1 RHOGAP, CDC15, and FER (176942). The
centrally located RHOGAP domain in SRGAP1 (amino acids 483 to 657) is
highly similar to the RHOGAP domains of SRGAP2, SRGAP3, and C1 RHOGAP.
The SH3 domain in SRGAP1 (amino acids 712 to 767) is similar to those in
SRGAP2, SRGAP3, C1 RHOGAP, and CSK (124095). Northern blot analysis
detected SRGAP1 transcripts of 8.0, 5.5, and 3.8 kb in all tissues
tested, with the 8.0-kb transcript being the most abundant. Western blot
analysis revealed a 130-kD SRGAP1 protein expressed at high levels in
brain, lung, and spleen. In situ hybridization of rodent tissues showed
that Srgap1 and Srgap2 are expressed in regions responsive to Slit.

GENE FUNCTION

Wong et al. (2001) found that SLIT increased SRGAP1-ROBO1 interaction
and inactivated CDC42 (116952). A dominant-negative SRGAP1 blocked SLIT
inactivation of CDC42 and SLIT repulsion of migratory cells from the
anterior subventricular zone of the forebrain. A constitutively active
CDC42 blocked the repulsive effect of SLIT. These results demonstrated
important roles for GAPs and CDC42 in neuronal migration.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
KIAA1304 gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP stSG4553).

604409	TITLE *604409 GLUCOCORTICOID MODULATORY ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 1; GMEB1
;;PARVOVIRUS INITIATION FACTOR, p96 SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using heat-shock protein-27 (HSP27; 602195) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
assay, Theriault et al. (1999) cloned a human cDNA encoding a deduced
573-amino acid protein that they called glucocorticoid modulatory
element-binding protein-1 (GMEB1). The GMEB1 protein has a KDWK domain,
contains sequences that are 95% identical to 3 tryptic peptides of rat
GMEB1, and shares 38% identity with rat GMEB2. A rabbit antibody raised
against a recombinant GMEB1 fusion protein detected an 85-kD polypeptide
in several human and mouse cell lines, in rat liver, and in different
mouse tissues. The authors suggested that the difference between the
apparent molecular mass of this polypeptide and the calculated molecular
mass of 62.5-kD derived from the protein sequence might reflect the high
content of acidic residues in GMEB1. By immunofluorescence of HeLa cells
expressing recombinant GMEB1, the authors localized the protein to the
nucleus. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the in vivo
interaction of HSP27 with GMEB1. GMEB1 translated in reticulocyte
lysates bound to 21-bp GME oligonucleotides in a gel-shift assay. The
resulting complex was similar in size to the complex obtained using rat
liver nucleotide extracts. Both complexes were supershifted with an
antibody specific to human GMEB1. The authors concluded that GMEB1 is a
trans-acting DNA-binding protein that may mediate the demonstrated
functions of GME as a positive modulator of the glucocorticoid response.

Christensen et al. (1999) copurified GMEB1 in a complex with GMEB2
(607451) from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Using degenerate primers
designed from the amino acid sequence followed by 5-prime and 3-prime
RACE, they cloned the full-length cDNAs. The deduced GMEB1 protein,
which they called p96, contains 563 amino acids and has a calculated
molecular mass of 60.4 kD. By SDS/PAGE analysis, the apparent molecular
mass was 96 kD. GMEB1 contains an N-terminal KDWK domain, and a highly
acidic C terminus that likely forms a coiled-coil structure. Recombinant
and endogenous GMEB1 share identical mobilities when analyzed by
SDS/PAGE analysis, indicating a lack of posttranslational modification.
Within the N-terminal KDWK domain, GMEB1 shares about 80% identity with
GMEB2; overall, they share about 40% identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Christensen et al. (1999) noted that the complex of GMEB1 and GMEB2,
which they designated parvovirus initiation factor (PIF) subunits p96
and p79, respectively, was originally recognized as a site-specific
DNA-binding complex essential for parvovirus DNA replication.
Christensen et al. (1999) found that GMEB2 and GMEB1 self-associate when
expressed alone, and that they form heterodimers when expressed
together. Cross-linking experiments indicated that no higher-order
multimers were formed. Each protein was active in promoter activation
assays, and the complex bound regulatory elements within the promoter
regions of tyrosine animotransferase (613018) and the transferrin
receptor gene (190010). Within its recognition site, PIF coordinately
bound 2 copies of the tetranucleotide PuCGPy, and these could be spaced
from 1 to 15 nucleotides apart.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GMEB1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG1681R).

148060	TITLE *148060 KERATIN 8; KRT8
;;K8;;
CYTOKERATIN 8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Keratin 8 is a type II keratin (Moll et al., 1982). Endo A is the mouse
equivalent. Endo B, which is the equivalent of human keratin 18
(148070), a type I keratin, is coexpressed with Endo A; the 2 appear to
be the first intermediate filament (IF) proteins expressed during murine
development (Jackson et al., 1980). Yamamoto et al. (1990) studied a
full-length cDNA for cytokeratin 8 from placenta. They determined the
distribution of cytokeratin 8 mRNA in various fetal tissues and in
placentae of different gestational ages.

Krauss and Franke (1990) cloned cytokeratin 8 from a genomic library.
The 485-amino acid protein deduced from the exon sequences has a
calculated molecular mass of about 53.5 kD. CK8 shows strong homology
with the corresponding bovine, mouse, and Xenopus proteins. The human
and mouse CK8 share about 82% identity in the N-terminal head domain,
95% identity in the alpha helical rod domain, and 67.5% identity in the
C-terminal tail.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (2002) presented evidence that soluble depolymerized K8
subunits were phosphorylated on ser73 by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1;
601158) upon stimulation of the proapoptotic cytokine receptor Fas
(134637) in colon carcinoma cells. K8 was also phosphorylated following
exposure to ultraviolet light. Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated
that JNK interacted directly with K8, and K8 was able to sequester a
substantial amount of the 54-kD isoform of JNK. The association of JNK
with K8 correlated with the decreased ability of JNK to phosphorylate
endogenous c-Jun (see 165160). He et al. (2002) hypothesized that K8
phosphorylation could regulate JNK signaling and/or keratin dynamics. Ku
et al. (2002) reported the phosphorylation of K8 ser73 by p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK14; 600289). p38 MAPK associated
with K8/K18 complexes in transfected baby hamster kidney cells,
phosphorylated K8 on ser73, and bound specifically to K8 in vitro. Ku et
al. (2002) noted that the leu160-to-pro mutation in K1 (139350.0002)
leads to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (113800). The comparable mutation
in K8 resulted in hyperphosphorylation of K8 due to neophosphorylation
of ser70 in addition to phosphorylation of ser73, and keratin filament
collapse in the presence of okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krauss and Franke (1990) determined that the CK8 gene contains 8 exons
instead of 9 as is found in all other type II cytokeratins due to lack
of intron 5, and the gene spans over 8.8 kb. The 5-prime flanking region
contains a TATA box, 1 SP1 (189906) motif, and an Alu-like sequence in
an orientation opposite that of the CK8 gene. Intron 1 is long (about
2.5 kb) and contains 3 SP1 sites, 1 AP1 (see 165160) site, and another
Alu element in the same orientation as CK8.

MAPPING

Keratins 8 and 18 of simple epithelia differ from the keratins of
stratified epithelia in tissue expression and regulation. Using PCR to
study DNAs from somatic cell hybrids, Waseem et al. (1990) located a
single active gene for keratin 8 on chromosome 12. This chromosome
contains several genes for type II keratins and also the gene for
keratin 18, the type I keratin that is coexpressed with keratin 8. This
location of both members of a keratin pair on a single chromosome is
unique among keratin genes; it is consistent with the hypothesis that
keratins 8 and 18 may be closer to an ancestral gene than the keratins
of more highly differentiated epithelia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

About 10% of patients who undergo liver transplantation have cryptogenic
liver disease. In animal models, the absence of heteropolymeric keratins
8 and 18 or the presence of mutant keratins in hepatocytes causes or
promotes liver disease. Ku et al. (1997) demonstrated a germline
mutation in keratin 18 (148070.0001) in 1 of 28 patients with
cryptogenic cirrhosis (see 215600). Of 55 patients with cryptogenic
liver disease screened by Ku et al. (2001), 5 unrelated patients had
mutations in the keratin 8 gene that appeared to have predisposed them
to the disease. Three patients had a gly61-to-cys mutation at a highly
conserved glycine (148060.0001), and the other 2 had a tyr53-to-his
mutation (148060.0002). These mutations were not detected in patients
with other forms of liver disease or in randomly selected patients. In
transfected cells, the gly61-to-cys mutation limited keratin filament
reorganization when the cells were exposed to oxidative stress. In
contrast, the tyr53-to-his mutation destabilized keratin filaments when
transfected cells were exposed to heat or okadaic acid stress.

Following up on the observation that KRT8 and KRT18 mutations are found
in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, Ku et al. (2003) investigated
the role of keratin mutations in noncryptogenic cirrhosis and the
incidence of keratin mutations in the general population. The results
suggested that K8 and K18 are likely susceptibility genes for developing
both cryptogenic and noncryptogenic forms of liver disease. They studied
314 liver explants of patients who primarily had noncryptogenic
cirrhosis and compared the results with 349 blood bank volunteers. Seven
unique K8/K18 mutations were found in 11 independent patients with
biliary atresia, hepatitis B/C, alcoholism, primary biliary cirrhosis,
and fulminant hepatitis. Seven of the 11 patients had mutations
previously described in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis: gly61 to
cys (148060.0001), tyr53 to his (148060.0002), and his127 to leu
(148070.0001). Of the 349 blood bank control samples, only 1 contained
the tyr53-to-his mutation and 1 the gly61-to-cys mutation. Livers with
keratin mutations had cytoplasmic filamentous deposits that were less
frequent in livers without the mutations (P = 0.03).

ANIMAL MODEL

Casanova et al. (1999) generated mice expressing the human KRT8 gene,
leading to a moderate increase in the content of keratin in simple
epithelia. These mice displayed progressive exocrine pancreas
alterations, including dysplasia and loss of acinar architecture,
redifferentiation of acinar to ductal cells, inflammation, fibrosis, and
substitution of exocrine by adipose tissue, as well as increased cell
proliferation and apoptosis. The phenotype was very similar to that
reported for transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative mutant
TGF-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2; 190182). Casanova et al. (1999)
showed that these Tgfbr2 mutant mice also had elevated KRT8/KRT18
levels. The results indicated that simple epithelial keratins play a
relevant role in the regulation of exocrine pancreas homeostasis and
supported the idea that disruption of mechanisms that normally regulate
keratin expression in vivo could be related to inflammatory and
neoplastic pancreatic disorders.

Jaquemar et al. (2003) determined that the lethality seen in genetically
sensitive K8-null mouse embryos is due to disruption of the trophoblast
giant cell layer that normally forms a barrier between the maternal and
embryonic compartments. Massive hemorrhages of maternal blood were found
between the decidua capsularis and the parietal yolk sac. Maternal tumor
necrosis factor (TNF; 191160) and TNF receptor (see 191190) contributed
to the lethality.

614601	TITLE *614601 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 326; ZNF326
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN INTERACTING WITH NUCLEAR MESSENGER RIBONUCLEOPROTEINS
AND DBC1; ZIRD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZNF326 is a subunit of a protein complex that regulates alternative mRNA
splicing (Close et al., 2012).

CLONING

By mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that copurified with
messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles from HEK293 cells, Close et
al. (2012) identified ZNF326, which they called ZIRD. By SDS-PAGE, ZIRD
had an apparent molecular mass of about 95 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Close et al. (2012) identified ZIRD and DBC1 (KIAA1967; 607359) as
subunits of an approximately 800-kD protein complex that they named the
ZIRD-DBC1 (DBIRD) complex. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of transfected
HEK293 cells revealed that ZIRD and DBC1 interacted directly. The 2
proteins also interacted directly with RNA polymerase II (see POLR2A;
180660) and with mRNPs, although the interaction with mRNPs depended
upon the presence of RNA. Depletion of ZIRD via RNA interference led to
increased exon inclusion in more than 2,800 cases, whereas exon
exclusion was observed in only 390 cases. Depletion of DBC1 led to exon
inclusion in 796 cases, most of which were also observed following ZIRD
depletion. The effect of ZIRD or DBC1 depletion occurred at the level of
alternative splicing. RNA immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that
the DBIRD complex bound to relevant exons in mRNAs from 7 tested genes.
The exons affected by DBIRD tended to be AT rich. Depletion of either
DBC1 or ZIRD slowed the rate of transcript elongation and RNA polymerase
II density. Close et al. (2012) concluded that the DBIRD complex affects
the efficiency of splicing, possibly by facilitating transcript
elongation across AT-rich regions and favoring exon inclusion.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the ZNF326 gene to chromosome 1p22.2 based on an
alignment of the ZNF326 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC014899) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNASEH2C gene encodes subunit C of the human ribonuclease H2 enzyme
complex which cleaves ribonucleotides from RNA:DNA duplexes. See also
RNASEH2A (606034) and RNASEH2B (610326).

CLONING

The RNASEH2C gene encodes a 164-amino acid protein (Crow et al., 2006).

GENE STRUCTURE

The RNASEH2C gene contains 4 exons (Crow et al., 2006).

MAPPING

The RNASEH2C gene maps to chromosome 11q13.2 (Crow et al., 2006).

GENE FUNCTION

By transient expression in HEK293T cells, Crow et al. (2006) showed that
the human RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C genes interact with each
other and form an enzymatic protein complex with RNase H2 activity. The
complex was able to recognize and cleave a single ribonucleotide
embedded in a DNA-DNA complex.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 5 Pakistani families with Aicardi-Goutieres
syndrome-3 (AGS3; 610329), Crow et al. (2006) identified a homozygous
mutation in the RNASH2C gene (610330.0001). Haplotype analysis suggested
a founder effect. Affected members of a Pakistani family carried another
homozygous mutation (610330.0002).

In affected members of 5 consanguineous Pakistani families with
Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome-3 (610329), Crow et al. (2006) identified a

601546	TITLE *601546 PROSPERO-RELATED HOMEOBOX 1; PROX1
;;HOMEOBOX GENE PROX1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinovieva et al. (1996) described the isolation of a human gene that is
homologous to the mouse Prox1 homeotic gene. PCR probes corresponding to
the mouse Prox1 gene were used to screen human genomic DNA libraries.
PCR probes corresponding to human PROX1 cDNA were used to screen fetal
brain cDNA libraries. Comparison of the human and chicken PROX1
nucleotide sequence demonstrated that they are highly conserved, with
overall homology of 94%. In the region of the homeodomain and the
prospero domain, the genes were identical. The prospero domain coincides
with a domain in a Drosophila gene that is expressed in Drosophila
central nervous system and in the developing lens-secreting cone cells
of the eye. Exon 1 of the human sequence showed no clear similarity to
the 3 alternatively spliced variants of chicken PROX1 cDNA. Human PROX1
exon 1 was found to contain repetitive sequences. Analysis of mRNA
revealed that Prox mRNA was present in many different human tissues and
that lens demonstrated the highest level. In all tissues but lens, PROX1
cDNA hybridized to a single band of 8 kb. In the embryonic lens an
additional component of 2 kb was present which appears to be derived by
alternative splicing. Zinovieva et al. (1996) noted that since the cDNA
isolated by them was only 2,924 bp and the mRNA transcript was 8.0 kb,
significant portions of the 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions of
the cDNA remained uncloned.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using combined analysis of cDNA and genomic DNA clones, Zinovieva et al.
(1996) found that the PROX1 gene is composed of at least 5 exons and 4
introns.

MAPPING

Zinovieva et al. (1996) mapped the PROX1 gene to chromosome 1 by
analysis of somatic cell hybrids. They also reported that the PROX1 gene
maps within a YAC contig that maps to chromosome 1q32.2-q32.3. Zinovieva
et al. (1996) reported that Usher syndrome type II (276901) maps close
to this region on chromosome 1 and that PROX1 can be considered as a
candidate gene for this disorder.

GENE FUNCTION

Wigle and Oliver (1999) reported that the Prox1 gene is expressed in a
subpopulation of endothelial cells that by budding and sprouting give
rise to the lymphatic system. The initial localization of these cells in
the veins and their subsequent budding were both polarized, suggesting
that unidentified guidance signals regulate this process. In Prox1-null
mice, budding and sprouting were arrested, although vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis of the vascular system were unaffected. These findings
suggested that Prox1 is a specific and required regulator of the
development of the lymphatic system and that the vascular and lymphatic
systems develop independently.

Several genes are required during the early phases of liver
specification, proliferation, and differentiation. Sosa-Pineda et al.
(2000) reported that Prox1 is required for hepatocyte migration in the
mouse. Loss of Prox1 led to formation of a smaller liver with a reduced
population of clustered hepatocytes surrounded by a laminin-rich basal
membrane.

Retinal progenitor cells regulate their proliferation during development
so that the correct number of each cell type is made at the appropriate
time. Dyer et al. (2003) found that the homeodomain protein Prox1
regulates the exit of progenitor cells from the cell cycle in the
embryonic mouse retina. Cells lacking Prox1 are less likely to stop
dividing, and ectopic expression of Prox1 forces progenitor cells to
exit the cell cycle. Other observations indicated that Prox1 activity is
both necessary and sufficient for progenitor-cell proliferation and
cell-fate determination in the vertebrate retina.

Francois et al. (2008) demonstrated that Sox18 (601618) acts as a
molecular switch to induce differentiation of lymphatic endothelial
cells. Sox18 is expressed in a subset of cardinal vein cells that later
coexpress Prox1 and migrate to form lymphatic vessels. Sox18 directly
activates Prox1 transcription by binding to its proximal promoter.

Johnson et al. (2008) showed that differentiation of lymphatic
endothelial cells in mice is a plastic and reprogrammable process that
depends on constant Prox1 activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated
downregulation of Prox1 in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells or
conditional downregulation of Prox1 during embryonic, postnatal, or
adult stages was sufficient to reprogram lymphatic endothelial cells
into blood endothelial cells.

Kazenwadel et al. (2010) identified a microRNA-181 (MIR181; see
612742)-binding sequence that was 100% conserved in the 3-prime ends of
human, mouse, rat, and chicken PROX1 transcripts. Mouse Mir181a bound
the 3-prime sequence of Prox1, inhibited its translation, and caused its
degradation. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis
showed reciprocal expression of Mir181a and Prox1 in embryonic mouse
lens and retina and in adult and embryonic blood and lymphatic
endothelial cells. Overexpression of Mir181a in embryonic lymphatic
endothelial cells caused degradation of Prox1 mRNA, reducing Prox1
protein expression and causing reprogramming of lymphatic endothelial
cells toward a blood vascular phenotype. Conversely, treatment of
primary embryonic blood vascular endothelial cells with an Mir181a
antagomir increased Prox1 mRNA levels. Kazenwadel et al. (2010)
concluded that MIR181A has a role in embryonic vascular development by
controlling PROX1 gene expression.

ANIMAL MODEL

The expression pattern of the Prox1 homeobox gene suggests that it has a
role in a variety of embryonic tissues, including lens. To analyze the
requirement for Prox1 during mammalian development, Wigle et al. (1999)
inactivated the locus in mice. Homozygous Prox1-null mice died at
midgestation from multiple developmental defects. Wigle et al. (1999)
described a specific effect on lens development. Prox1 inactivation
caused abnormal cellular proliferation, downregulated expression of the
cell cycle inhibitors Cdkn1b (600778) and Cdkn1c (600856), misexpression
of E-cadherin (192090), and inappropriate apoptosis. Consequently,
mutant lens cells failed to polarize and elongate properly, resulting in
a hollow lens. The data provided evidence that the progression of
terminal fiber differentiation and elongation is dependent on Prox1
activity during lens development.

Multiple organs cooperate to regulate appetite, metabolism, and glucose
and fatty acid homeostasis. Harvey et al. (2005) identified and
characterized lymphatic vasculature dysfunction as a cause of
adult-onset obesity. They found that functional inactivation of a single
allele of the homeobox gene Prox1 in mice led to adult-onset obesity due
to abnormal lymph leakage from mispatterned and ruptured lymphatic
vessels. They proposed that Prox1 heterozygous mice are a model for
adult-onset obesity and lymphatic vascular disease. They proposed that
there is crosstalk between the lymphatic vasculature and adipose tissue.
They proposed a model in which lymph linkage promotes adipose tissue
accumulation in 2 phases: first, increased storage of leaking lipids in
existing adipocytes causes adipocyte hypertrophy; and second, once the
adipocytes reach maximum lipid storage capacity, the promotion of
preadipocyte differentiation results in adipocyte hyperplasia in older
and more obese mice. Harvey et al. (2005) suggested that in the human,
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with
lymphatic development could predispose individuals to adult-onset
obesity.

602835	TITLE *602835 GROWTH ARREST-SPECIFIC 2; GAS2
DESCRIPTION Schneider et al. (1988) identified a group of genes that are highly
expressed during growth arrest in murine fibroblasts. Brancolini et al.
(1992) characterized one of those genes, Gas2. Using immunofluorescence,
they found that Gas2 is a component of the microfilament system. Gas2
colocalizes with actin fibers at the cell border and along the stress
fibers in growth-arrested mouse fibroblasts. On Western blots of both
human and mouse fibroblast extracts, antibodies against Gas2 recognized
a 36-kD protein. By screening a human kidney library with a fragment of
the mouse Gas2 cDNA, Collavin et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding
human GAS2. The predicted 313-amino acid human protein differs in only 8
residues from mouse Gas2. When expressed in mammalian cells, human GAS2
localized at the actin cytoskeleton, along the stress fibers and at the
plasma membrane. Like the mouse protein, GAS2 is proteolytically cleaved
in apoptotic cells. Using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, Collavin et
al. (1998) determined that GAS2 was expressed in most of the tissues
analyzed, with the highest levels of protein found in liver, lung, and
kidney.

Colombo et al. (1992) showed that the Gas2 gene is linked to markers on
mouse chromosome 7. By fluorescence in situ hybridization and by
analysis of a radiation hybrid panel, Collavin et al. (1998) mapped the
human GAS2 gene to 11p15.2-p14.3, a region that has homology of synteny
with mouse chromosomal band 7C.

;;UNACTIVE PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR, 23-KD; P23;;
PROSTAGLANDIN E SYNTHASE, CYTOSOLIC; CPGES
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

P23 was first observed as a component of the unactivated avian
progesterone receptor complex, along with HSP70 (see 140550) and HSP90
(see 140571) (Smith et al., 1990). Using the chicken p23 sequence as
probe, Johnson et al. (1994) cloned P23 from a human testis cDNA
library. The deduced 160-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 19 kD and contains several putative phosphorylation sites.
P23 shares about 96% sequence identity with the chicken homolog. Western
blot analysis revealed a 23-kD band in tissue and cell lysates from
several mammalian species including human.

GENE FUNCTION

Freeman and Yamamoto (2002) determined that the P23 molecular chaperone
localizes to genomic response elements in a hormone-dependent manner and
showed that it could disrupt receptor-mediated transcriptional
activation.

Synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from arachidonic acid involves
multiple enzymes, and 2 isoforms of the terminal enzyme of this
biosynthetic pathway, PGE synthase (PGES), have been identified.
Cytosolic PTGES (cPGES) is identical to the heat-shock protein-90 (see
140571) chaperone p23 (Tanioka et al., 2000) and is functionally coupled
to constitutive prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthase-1 (176805) (Han et
al., 2002). Microsomal PTGES (mPGES; 605172) is inducible by
proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1B (147720). Meadows et al. (2003)
studied expression and localization of both enzyme isoforms in human
fetal membranes either at term or preterm, with or without labor.
Western blot analysis of the amnion and choriodecidua showed no
differences in amounts of either cPGES or mPGES at term or preterm, with
or without labor, in either tissue with advancing gestation. Meadows et
al. (2003) concluded that expression of PGES is not the rate-limiting
step in PGE2 synthesis in fetal membranes at labor.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the P23
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP SHGC-35709).

610972	TITLE *610972 ADHERENS JUNCTION-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; AJAP1
;;SHREW1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display RT-PCR to identify cDNAs specific to invasive
versus noninvasive derivatives of an endometriotic cell line, followed
by database analysis and 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a brain cDNA
library, Bharti et al. (2004) cloned AJAP1, which they called SHREW1.
The predicted 411-amino acid protein is highly alkaline and has a
calculated molecular mass of 43 kD. It contains an N-terminal signal
peptide, a transmembrane domain, and potential sites for
phosphorylation, glycosylation, and myristoylation. Database analysis
suggested that SHREW1 may be restricted to vertebrates. Northern blot
analysis of invasive endometriotic cells detected a 4-kb SHREW1
transcript. Immunoblot analysis of human pancreas and uterus revealed an
endogenous 48-kD SHREW1 protein. Epitope-tagged SHREW1 localized to the
basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells and colocalized with
E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090), a marker of adherens junctions.

GENE FUNCTION

Schreiner et al. (2007) found that overexpression of SHREW1 protein
enhanced invasiveness of human fibrosarcoma cells. SHREW1 interacted
with CD147 (BSG; 109480), a mediator of invasiveness and matrix
metalloprotease activity, in epithelial cells. Downregulation of SHREW1
or CD147 using small interfering RNA in HeLa cells decreased
invasiveness without affecting proliferation. Schreiner et al. (2007)
concluded that SHREW1-CD147 interaction is associated with regulation of
cellular invasion.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the AJAP1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SGC32361).

615428	TITLE *615428 DEAD BOX POLYPEPTIDE 47; DDX47
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DDX47 is predicted to be an RNA helicase with a role in early ribosomal
biogenesis (Sekiguchi et al., 2006).

CLONING

Sekiguchi et al. (2006) cloned DDX47 by PCR of a human Burkitt lymphoma
cDNA library. The deduced 455-amino acid protein has a DEADc RNA
helicase domain in its N-terminal half, followed by a helicase
superfamily C-terminal (HELICc) domain. It also has an N-terminal
nuclear export signal and a C-terminal nuclear localization signal.
Fluorescence-tagged DDX47 colocalized with the nucleolar proteins NOP132
(NOL8; 611534) and KIAA0559 (NAP1; 608865) in nucleoli of transfected
HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analyses, Lee et al.
(2005) identified DDX47 as a binding partner of GABARAP (605125) in
human 2774 and SKOV-3 ovarian tumor cell lysates. Yeast 2-hybrid
analysis confirmed the interaction. Overexpression of either DDX47 or
GABARAP alone had no effect on proliferation of SKOV-3 cells; however,
their coexpression inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis.

Sekiguchi et al. (2006) characterized proteins that immunoprecipitated
with epitope-tagged NOP132 from human 293EBNA cells. Mass spectrometric
and database analysis identified DDX18 (606355) and DDX47, in addition
to many proteins from the large and small ribosomal subunits and
proteins previously characterized in human pre-ribosomal nucleoprotein
complexes. A similar complement of proteins immunoprecipitated with
DDX18 or DDX47. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed association
of NOP132 with DDX18 and DDX47, but not with other DDX proteins. RNase
treatment significantly decreased association of NOP132 with DDX18 and
DDX47, suggesting that their interaction depends on RNA. Similarly,
RNase treatment released most of the NOP132-, DDX18-, and
DDX47-associated proteins. Epitope-tagged DDX47 associated with several
rRNA precursors and with 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA, suggesting that DDX47
is involved in early stages of pre-rRNA processing. Knockdown of NOP132
by small interfering RNA caused mislocalization of DDX47 to the
nucleolar periphery. Knockdown of either NOP132 or DDX47 decreased the
amount of mature rRNA and rRNA precursors. Mutation analysis revealed
that the coiled-coil region of NOP132 interacted with the HELICc motif
of DDX47. Sekiguchi et al. (2006) concluded that NOP132 is required for
proper targeting of DDX47 to the nucleolar organizing region, and that
DDX47 has a role in early ribosome biogenesis.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the DDX47 gene to chromosome 12p13.1 based on an
alignment of the DDX47 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF078843) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). Sekiguchi et al. (2006)

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs; see 603478) are proteases that
specifically cleave ubiquitin (191339) linkages, negating the action of
ubiquitin ligases. DUBA8 belongs to a DUB subfamily characterized by an
ovarian tumor (OTU) domain.

Kayagaki et al. (2007) identified ovarian tumor domain (OTU)-containing
protein 2 (OTUD2) in a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based screen for
OTU deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family members. The 6,265-basepair
mRNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) predicting a 348-amino acid
protein. In addition to an OTU domain, the protein includes a zinc
finger (ZNF) C2H2 domain.

MAPPING

The YOD1 gene maps to chromosome 1q32.1 (Kayagaki et al., 2007).

602838	TITLE *602838 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE, CLASS 2, BETA; PIK3C2B
DESCRIPTION Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate the 3-prime OH position
of the inositol ring of inositol lipids. They have been shown to have
critical roles in signal transduction, cell transformation, and
intracellular protein trafficking. Three classes of PI3Ks can be
distinguished on the basis of their in vitro lipid substrate
specificity, sequence homology, and structural characteristics. The
class II PI3Ks phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol and
phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, but not phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate, and are defined by the presence of a C-terminal C2
domain. C2 domains act as calcium-dependent phospholipid binding motifs
that mediate translocation of proteins to membranes, and have also been
shown to mediate interactions between proteins.

Using RT-PCR of breast RNA with degenerate primers derived from
conserved motifs within the lipid kinase domain of PI3Ks, Brown et al.
(1997) isolated cDNAs encoding a protein that they designated HsC2-PI3K.
Sequence analysis revealed that the predicted 1,634-amino acid protein
is a PI3K that is most closely related to the class II PI3Ks. The C2
domain of HsC2-PI3K lacks 3 of 4 conserved aspartate residues implicated
in calcium binding, and therefore the authors considered it likely that
this C2 domain functions in a calcium-independent manner. Brown et al.
(1997) found by Northern blot analysis that HsC2-PI3K is expressed as an
8.5-kb transcript in various tissues, with the highest level of
expression in thymus and placenta.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Brown et al. (1997) mapped the
PIK3C2B gene to 1q32.

;;PAROTID SALIVARY GLYCOPROTEIN; G1;;
BASIC SALIVARY PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN, BstNI TYPE, 3
DESCRIPTION For background information on salivary proline-rich proteins, see PRB1
(180989).

Azen et al. (1978) found 5 alleles. Linkage with Pr, Db, and Pa was
indicated by linkage disequilibrium. These genes presumably arose by
gene duplication, in view of the structural similarity of the gene
products. They play an important role in inhibiting calcium phosphate
precipitation from saliva and the glycoprotein forms part of the
acquired dental pellicle and plaque. On the basis of relative degrees of
linkage disequilibrium, Azen and Denniston (1980) favored positioning of
G1 'outside' Db, to give suggested gene order Pa-Pr-Db-G1. Ikemoto et
al. (1979) delineated a polymorphic salivary glycoprotein they
symbolized Ph (salivary parotid heavy protein). The relation to G1 of
Azen et al. (1978) was not known. According to the hypothesis of Maeda
(1985), as outlined in 168730, 6 loci constituting 2 gene subfamilies
code the salivary proline-rich proteins. One subfamily, with 2 genes,
codes the acidic proteins; the genes are rich in HaeIII restriction
sites and are designated PRH1 and PRH2. The other subfamily, with 4
loci, codes the basic proteins; the genes are rich in BstNI restriction
sites and are designated PRB1, PRB2, PRB3, and PRB4. Maeda (1985)
concluded that the gene she designated PRB3 probably codes G1. Which
ones of the other basic proline-rich proteins are coded by PRB1, 2 and 4
is not yet certain. Sequencing and restriction mapping indicate that the
PRP cluster is in a segment of DNA about 500 kb long (Maeda, 1985).
There is no information on the order and linkage relationships of the 6
genes. The 2 genes PRH1 (168730) and PRH2 (168790) have been completely
sequenced (Kim and Maeda, 1986). The sequence information confirms the
allelic relationship of Db, Pa, and PIF.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PRB3S(CYS)
PRB3, ARG15CYS

In the saliva of an Ashkenazi Jew, Azen et al. (1990) established
compound heterozygosity for a null mutation and a missense mutation. The
missense mutation was a CGT-to-TGT (arg-to-cys) change at nucleotide 45
in the tandemly repetitious exon 3 (the major protein-coding portion).
Azen et al. (1990) referred to this missense mutation as the PRB3S(cys)
allele and concluded that it accounts for the disulfide-bonded and
peroxidase-modifying properties of the G1-8 variant. The G1-8 protein
variant was found in Ashkenazi Jews with a gene frequency of
approximately 0.008 but was not found in the general Caucasian, black,
or Japanese populations. Both G1-8, coded by the PRB3 locus, and Pa-1,
coded by the PRH1 locus, are disulfide bonded and probably modify
salivary peroxidase (part of an important intraoral antibacterial
system) through formation of disulfide-bonded heterodimers.

.0002
PRB3M(NULL)
PRB3, 1-BP INS

In the Ashkenazi Jew in whom Azen et al. (1990) found compound
heterozygosity for mutations at the PRB3 locus (see 168840.0001), one of
the alleles was identified as a null allele resulting from a single
nucleotide insertion that led to a frameshift and a premature
termination codon. Null alleles are frequent at PRP loci, apparently
because of an intragenic unequal crossover.

;;CD3 ANTIGEN, ZETA SUBUNIT; CD3Z;;
CD3-ZETA;;
T-CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR COMPLEX, ZETA SUBUNIT OF CD3; TCRZ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Weissman et al. (1986) used an antiserum raised against the mouse zeta
subunit of the T-cell antigen receptor to identify a previously
unrecognized component of the human T-cell antigen receptor. This human
protein is T-cell specific and biochemically similar to the murine zeta
polypeptide, which has a molecular weight of 16K. The zeta chain, which,
like the epsilon chain, is nonglycosylated, exists in the T-cell
receptor molecule as a disulfide-linked homodimer.

Weissman et al. (1988) cloned a cDNA encoding the zeta chain of the
murine T-cell antigen receptor. The predicted protein sequence suggested
a structure distinct from those of any of the previously described
receptor subunits.

As indicated by Clevers et al. (1988), the T-cell receptor alpha/beta
and gamma/delta heterodimers are noncovalently associated with the
CD3-gamma (186740), -delta (186790), -epsilon (186830), and -zeta
proteins, together forming the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex. Weissman et
al. (1988) used the cDNA for the murine zeta gene as a probe to isolate
cDNAs encoding the human CD3Z gene. Comparison of the human and murine
genes showed a high degree of conservation, including conservation in
the nucleotide sequence of the 5-prime and 3-prime untranslated regions.
No significant sequence and structural homology was found, however, with
the previously characterized invariant delta, gamma, and epsilon chains
of the T-cell receptor.

GENE FUNCTION

The zeta chain of the T-cell antigen receptor plays an important role in
coupling antigen recognition to several intracellular
signal-transduction pathways. Caplan et al. (1995) presented evidence
that the zeta chain, while expressed on the T-cell surface, is
associated with the cytoskeletal matrix. A 42-amino acid region in the
intracytoplasmic domain of the zeta chain proved crucial for maximal
interaction between zeta chain and the cytoskeleton.

CD4 (186940) binds to relatively invariant sites on class II major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules outside the peptide-binding
groove, which interacts with the T-cell receptor (TCR). CD4 enhances
T-cell sensitivity to antigen and binds to LCK (153390), which
phosphorylates CD3Z. Instead of clustering in a cap at the interface
with an antigen-presenting cell (APC), some signaling molecules involved
in T-cell recognition segregate into distinct areas to form a SMAC
(supramolecular activation cluster), contributing to the immunologic
synapse (see Grakoui et al. (1999)). Using T-cell lines transfected with
green fluorescent protein-fused CD4 or CD3Z and 3-dimensional video
microscopy, Krummel et al. (2000) showed that in response to
peptide-loaded APC, CD3Z and CD4 initially cluster in the contact area
between the T cell and APC coincident with intracellular calcium
mobilization. Stable immunologic synapse formation was modulated by
peptide concentration and compromised by blocking the calcium increase
or cytoskeletal rearrangement. The authors determined that CD3Z remains
at the center of the interface while CD4 moves to the periphery.
Blocking with anti-TCR prevented CD3Z accumulation and inhibited calcium
mobilization. The data suggested that instead of stabilizing TCR-MHC
complexes, CD4 functions to initiate or augment the early phase of
T-cell activation.

MAPPING

The CD3Z gene was localized by Weissman et al. (1988) to the centromeric
region of chromosome 1 by study of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization, emphasizing the fact that it is a distinct genetic
component of the T-cell receptor (the CD3D, CD3G, and CD3E genes are
clustered within 300 kb of each other on 11q23). The gene was assigned
to 1p22.1-q21.1. Baniyash et al. (1989) mapped the homologous gene in
the mouse to chromosome 1. Sturm et al. (1995) mapped the human OTF1
gene (164175) to 1q22-q23 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The
physical linkage of the CD3Z gene to the OTF1 transcription unit
indicates that CD3Z is also located at 1q22-q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006) described a 4-month-old boy with primary
T-cell immunodeficiency (610163) who was found to have a homozygous
germline Q70X mutation in the CD3Z gene (186780.0001). CD3-zeta is
necessary for the development and function of T cells. Some of the
patient's T cells had low levels of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex and
carried the Q70X mutation on both alleles of the CD3Z gene, whereas
other T cells had normal levels of the complex and bore the Q70X
mutation on only 1 allele of CD3Z, plus 1 of 3 heterozygous somatic
mutations of CD3Z on the other allele (186780.0002-186780.0004),
allowing expression of poorly functional T-cell receptor-CD3 complexes.
Thus the patient had both inherited and somatic CD3Z mutations as the
basis of the T-cell deficiency.

Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006) noted that the finding of somatic mutations
of a germline mutation in the CD3Z gene recalled somatic mutations of
germline mutations of the adenosine deaminase gene (608958), the
interleukin-2 receptor gamma-c gene (IL2RG; 308380), the
recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG1; 179615), the Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome protein (301000), and the NEMO gene (300248). These somatic
changes could cause the mutant gene to revert to a wildtype gene or to a
sequence compatible with expression of the corresponding protein. In the
patient of Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006), these somatic mutations occurring
in the initially mutated codon were probably not due to a mutation
hotspot related to genomic instability, since these variants were not
found in other cell types from the patient. Furthermore, the T cells
with normal levels of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex were polyclonal,
and each of the 3 somatic variants of CD3Z was found in different
populations of T cells, each with a distinct rearrangement of V(beta)
genes. This result indicated that the somatic mutations in CD3Z probably
occurred before the VDJ recombination process in T-cell progenitors. The
somatic mutations partially corrected the CD3Z deficiency, providing an
example of the modulation of T-cell immunodeficiency by somatic
mutations and of the selection of clones with such mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Class I MHC molecules, known to be important for immune responses to
antigen, are expressed also by neurons that undergo activity-dependent,
long-term structural and synaptic modifications. Huh et al. (2000)
showed that in mice genetically deficient for cell surface class I MHC,
due to deletion of either TAP1 (170260) or beta-2-microglobulin
(109700), or for the class I MHC receptor component CD3Z, refinement of
connections between retina and central targets during development is
incomplete. In the hippocampus of adult mutants, N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor-dependent long-term potentiation is enhanced, and long-term
depression is absent. Specific class I MHC mRNAs are expressed by
distinct mosaics of neurons, reflecting a potential for diverse neuronal
functions. These results demonstrated an important role for these
molecules in the activity-dependent remodeling and plasticity of
connections in the developing and mature mammalian central nervous
system.

In mice chronically exposed to antigens of Porphyromonas gingivalis,
Bronstein-Sitton et al. (2003) observed that Ifng (147570)-dependent
Tcrz downregulation, due to lysosomal degradation, and impaired in vitro
T-cell function occurred in a way similar to that reported in a number
of infectious, autoimmune, and cancer pathologies. The in vitro findings
correlated with a deficient in vivo response, as assessed by reduced
immunity to influenza virus infection. Normal immune function and Tcrz
expression were regained after the cessation of chronic antigen
exposure.

By in situ hybridization of wildtype mouse retina, Xu et al. (2010)
showed that Cd3-zeta was preferentially expressed in the retinal
ganglion cell (RGC) layer. In Cd3-zeta -/- mice, the kinetics of RGC
dendritic elimination was markedly reduced, and the number of dendritic
protrusions was significantly increased during early postnatal
development. These defects could be mimicked in wildtype mice by
applying glutamate receptor (GLUR; see 138248) antagonists. Disruption
of RGC synaptic activity and dendritic motility was associated with a
failure of eye-specific segregation of RGC axon projections to the
central nervous system. Xu et al. (2010) concluded that CD3-zeta
regulates synaptic wiring and selectively impairs GLUR-mediated synaptic
activity in retina during development.

In a 4-month-old boy of Caribbean origin with primary T-cell
immunodeficiency (610163), Rieux-Laucat et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a gln70-to-stop (Q70X) nonsense mutation in the CD3Z
gene. The premature stop codon was located within the first ITAM domain,
immediately upstream from the first YXXL motif, precluding expression of
all ITAM motifs and thus any interaction with the tyrosine kinase ZAP70
(176947). The boy's mother was heterozygous for the Q70X mutation. The
patient's other T cells had normal levels of the CD3 complex and bore
the Q70X mutation on only 1 allele of CD3Z, plus 1 of 3 heterozygous
somatic mutations of CD3Z on the other allele, allowing expression of
poorly functional T-cell receptor-CD3 complexes. The heterozygous
somatic mutations of CD3Z were Q70W (186780.0002), Q70L (186780), and
Q70Y (186780).

609507	TITLE *609507 TOPOISOMERASE I-BINDING ARGININE/SERINE-RICH PROTEIN; TOPORS
;;p53-BINDING PROTEIN 3; P53BP3;;
LUN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using murine p53 (191170) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa
cell cDNA library, Zhou et al. (1999) obtained a partial cDNA encoding
TOPORS, which they called P53BP3. TOPORS is rich in serine and arginine
and contains a leucine zipper domain, 2 PEST sequences, a central basic
domain containing 2 potential bipartite nuclear localization signals,
and 2 C-terminal PEST sequences. Northern blot analysis detected
ubiquitous but variable expression of a 5.0-kb transcript. Highest
expression was in testis, and lowest expression was in lung.
Fluorescence-labeled TOPORS localized to nuclear star-like clusters in
transfected HeLa cells.

Using the N-terminal 250 amino acids of topoisomerase I (TOP1; 126420)
as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed
by 5-prime RACE of leukemia cell mRNA, Haluska et al. (1999) cloned
TOPORS. They extended the 5-prime coding region reported by Zhou et al.
(1999) and determined that the full-length protein contains 1,045 amino
acids.

Using degenerate primers to amplify cDNAs encoding RING finger proteins
from human lung cDNA, followed by screening a lung cDNA library, Chu et
al. (2001) cloned TOPORS, which they designated LUN. The deduced
1,045-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 119 kD.
TOPORS contains an N-terminal PEST sequence, followed by a C3H4-type
RING finger domain, a leucine zipper coiled-coil region, 2 PEST
sequences, a nuclear localization signal, and 2 C-terminal PEST
sequences. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.8-kb transcript in brain,
kidney, liver, lung, spleen, pancreas, and skeletal muscle, and a 3.6-kb
transcript in heart and lung. Highest expression of TOPORS was in lung.
In situ hybridization of adult lung sections detected TOPORS in alveolar
epithelium and in some squamous and cuboidal cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Zhou et al. (1999) determined that a central
region of TOPORS containing the putative nuclear localization signal and
2 PEST sequences was required for interaction with p53. The leucine
zipper of TOPORS was dispensable for interaction with p53.

By coimmunoprecipitation assays of transfected HeLa cells, Haluska et
al. (1999) confirmed that TOPORS interacts with TOP1.

Chu et al. (2001) found that TOPORS had zinc-dependent DNA binding
activity. The region from amino acids 51 to 374 was responsible for DNA
binding. Chu et al. (2001) identified a palindromic DNA sequence that
bound TOPORS in the upstream regulatory region of the E-cadherin gene
(CDH1; 192090) and in 2 intervening regions of the talin gene (TLN1;
186745).

Rajendra et al. (2004) found that TOPORS functioned in vitro as an E3
ubiquitin ligase with the E2 enzymes UBCH5A (UBE2D1; 602961), UBCH5C
(UBE2D3; 602963), and UBCH6 (UBE2E1; 602916), but not with other E2
enzymes examined. A conserved tryptophan within the RING domain of
TOPORS was required for ubiquitination activity. In vitro and cellular
studies implicated p53 as a ubiquitination substrate for TOPORS. Similar
to MDM2 (164785), overexpression of TOPORS resulted in a
proteasome-dependent decrease in p53 protein expression in a human
osteosarcoma cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

The TOPORS gene contains 3 exons and spans 13 kb (Haluska et al., 1999).

MAPPING

By FISH, Zhou et al. (1999) mapped the TOPORS gene to chromosome
12p12.1-p11.2. However, Chu et al. (2001) mapped the TOPORS gene by FISH
to chromosomes 9p21, a localization confirmed by the International
Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium (TMAP RH98974).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chakarova et al. (2007) used a positional cloning approach to sequence
genes in the critical region on 9p21.1 linked to a form of autosomal
dominant retinitis pigmentosa with a distinct phenotype (RP31; 609923).
They identified a heterozygous 1-bp insertion in exon 3 of the TOPORS
gene in a Canadian family (609507.0001). In a small German family, a
2-bp deletion in exon 3 was associated with the characteristic phenotype
(609507.0002). Chakarova et al. (2007) commented that the ubiquitous
nature of TOPORS expression and a lack of mutant protein in patients was
highly suggestive of haploinsufficiency, rather than a dominant-negative
effect, as the molecular mechanism of the disease and made the clinical
phenotype amenable to rescue by somatic gene therapy.

158270	TITLE *158270 MOTILIN; MLN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Motilin, a 22-amino acid hormone synthesized by cells of the small
intestine, regulates interdigestive gastrointestinal contraction. Seino
et al. (1987) cloned a cDNA encoding the human motilin precursor from an
intestinal cDNA library. The predicted amino acid sequence indicated
that the motilin precursor consists of 115 amino acids and includes a
25-residue N-terminal signal peptide followed by the 22-amino acid
motilin sequence and a long, 68-residue C-terminal peptide.

Feighner et al. (1999) identified the motilin receptor (602885) in the
human gastrointestinal system and found that it is expressed in enteric
neurons of the human duodenum and colon.

By Northern blot analysis, Gasparini et al. (1994) detected high levels
of a 0.7-kb MLN mRNA transcript in cells containing cilia, including
bronchoepithelial cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Daikh et al. (1989) showed that the motilin gene consists of 5 exons
spanning approximately 9 kb of genomic DNA. Exon 1 encodes the 5-prime
untranslated portion of the motilin mRNA. Exons 2 and 3 encode the
signal peptide and the 22-amino acid motilin peptide.

MAPPING

By a combination of Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in
situ hybridization, Fan et al. (1989) assigned the MLN gene to 6p21.2.

Gasparini et al. (1994) showed that MLN is tightly linked to the
HLA-DQ-alpha locus (HLA-DQA1; 146880). They excluded mutations in the
MLN gene as a cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia (CILD1; 244400) in a
family that had shown linkage to chromosome 6p21.

;;TYROSYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE, MITOCHONDRIAL;;
MT-TYRRS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching a database for tRNA synthetases, Bonnefond et al. (2005)
identified YARS2, which they called MT-TYRRS. The deduced 477-amino acid
protein contains a 16-amino acid mitochondrial targeting signal and
catalytic site motifs characteristic of amino acid tRNA synthetases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bonnefond et al. (2005) determined that the YARS2 gene contains 5 exons
and spans 8.6 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the YARS2
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP G35326). Riley et al. (2010) stated that the
YARS2 gene maps to chromosome 12p11.21.

GENE FUNCTION

Bonnefond et al. (2005) found that recombinant YARS2 aminoacylated
purified E. coli tRNA-tyr and in vitro transcribed human mitochondrial
tRNA-tyr (MTTY; 590100). Gel-filtration chromatography showed that
recombinant YARS2 formed dimers.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Paukstelis et al. (2008) determined a 4.5-angstrom resolution co-crystal
structure of the bacteriophage Twort orf142-I2 group I intron ribozyme
bound to splicing-active, carboxy-terminally truncated mitochondrial
tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from Neurospora. The structure shows that the
group I intron binds across the 2 subunits of the homodimeric protein
with a newly evolved RNA-binding surface distinct from that which binds
tyrosine tRNA. This RNA binding surface provides an extended scaffold
for the phosphodiester backbone of the conserved catalytic core of the
intron RNA, allowing the protein to promote the splicing of a wide
variety of group I introns. The group I intron-binding surface includes
3 small insertions and additional structural adaptations relative to
nonsplicing bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases, indicating a multistep
adaptation for splicing function. Paukstelis et al. (2008) concluded
that the fungal mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases provide a unique
model system for studying how essential proteins in general, and
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in particular, can progressively acquire new
functions and evolve to bind multiple structurally related RNAs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing of
2 consanguineous Lebanese families with myopathy, lactic acidosis, and
sideroblastic anemia-2 (MLASA2; 613561), Riley et al. (2010) identified
a homozygous mutation in the YARS2 gene (F52L; 610957.0001). In vitro
functional expression assays showed that the mutant YARS2 protein had an
overall 9-fold loss of catalytic efficiency. The findings indicated that
the mutation resulted in reduced aminoacylation efficiency, causing a
defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis with a subsequent impairment
of mitochondrial respiratory activity.

In 3 patients from 2 consanguineous Lebanese families with mitochondrial
myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia-2 (MLASA2; 613561),
Riley et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 156C-G transversion in the
YARS2 gene, resulting in a phe52-to-leu (F52L) substitution in a
conserved region of the catalytic domain. Haplotype analysis suggested a
founder effect, but the mutation was not observed in 220 control
chromosomes, including 104 of Lebanese origin. Immunoblot analysis of
patient skeletal muscle showed slightly reduced levels of YARS2, as well
as reduced levels of mitochondrial-encoded protein subunits of
respiratory chain complexes, indicating a reduction in mitochondrial
protein synthesis. In vitro functional expression assays showed that the
mutant YARS2 protein had a 2-fold reduction in catalytic activity and a
reduction in affinity for tRNA-tyr, resulting in an overall 9-fold loss
of catalytic efficiency. The findings indicated that the mutation
resulted in reduced aminoacylation efficiency, causing a defect in
mitochondrial protein synthesis with a subsequent impairment of
mitochondrial respiratory activity.

;;WASP FAMILY, MEMBER 2;;
WASP FAMILY, VERPROLIN HOMOLOGY DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; WAVE2;;
SCAR, DICTYOSTELIUM, HOMOLOG OF, 2; SCAR2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The actin cytoskeleton plays critical roles in cell morphologic changes
and motility. Rho family small GTPases, such as Rho (see 165370), RAC
(see 602048), and CDC42 (116952), organize the actin cytoskeleton. Other
major players in actin-based motility are the 7 members of the ARP2/3
complex (see 604221). The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP;
301000), WASP-like (WASL; 605056), and WASF2 are among the downstream
effector molecules involved in the transmission of signals from tyrosine
kinase receptors and small GTPases to the actin cytoskeleton. WASF1
(605035) is also involved in actin reorganization, but its expression is
restricted to brain.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of WASF1 and by screening cDNA
libraries, Suetsugu et al. (1999) identified WASF2 and WASF3 (605068),
which they termed WAVE2 and WAVE3, respectively. The predicted 498-amino
acid WASF2 protein shares 48% amino acid identity with WASF1. Northern
blot analysis detected WASF2 expression in all tissues tested except
skeletal muscle, with strongest expression in placenta, lung, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using SDS-PAGE analysis, Suetsugu et al. (1999) showed that, like other
WASP family members, WASF2 binds actin through its C-terminal verprolin
homology (VPH) domain. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that
ectopically expressed WASF2 induces abnormal actin clusters. These actin
cluster formations were suppressed by deletion of the VPH domain of
WASF2.

Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP, or WASL) functions in
several intracellular events including filopodium formation, vesicle
transport, and movement of viruses, by stimulating rapid actin
polymerization through the ARP2/3 complex. N-WASP is regulated by the
direct binding of CDC42, which exposes the domain in N-WASP that
activates the ARP2/3 complex. The WASP-related protein WAVE functions in
RAC-induced membrane ruffling; however, RAC does not bind directly to
WAVE, raising the question of how WAVE is regulated by RAC. Miki et al.
(2000) demonstrated that IRSP53 (605475), a substrate for insulin
receptor with unknown function, is the 'missing link' between RAC and
WAVE2. Activated RAC binds to the N terminus of IRSP53, and the
C-terminal SH3 domain of IRSP53 binds to WAVE2 to form a trimolecular
complex. From studies of ectopic expression, Miki et al. (2000) found
that IRSP53 is essential for RAC to induce membrane ruffling, probably
because it recruits WAVE2, which stimulates actin polymerization
mediated by the ARP2/3 complex.

Suetsugu et al. (2003) observed that, following PDGF (see 190040)
stimulation, Wave2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed
impaired peripheral ruffle formation, and Wave1-deficient fibroblasts
displayed impaired dorsal ruffle formation. Wave2, but not Wave1, was
essential for directed cell migration in the absence of extracellular
matrix (ECM), when cells migrated with peripheral ruffles at the leading
edge. In contrast, both Wave1 and Wave2 were essential for invading
migration into ECM, suggesting that the leading edge in ECM has
characteristics of both ruffles. In dorsal ruffles, Wave1 colocalized
with ECM-degrading enzyme Mmp2 (120360), which was required for
Wave1-dependent migration, but not Wave2-dependent migration.

Oikawa et al. (2004) determined that mouse Wave2 contains an N-terminal
inositol phosphate-binding domain. Expression of a full-length Wave2
mutant lacking lipid-binding activity inhibited proper formation of
lamellipodia in mouse fibroblasts.

MAPPING

Suetsugu et al. (1999) stated that the WASF2 gene maps to Xp11.21, near
the WASP gene at Xp11.22. Scott (2001) mapped the WASF2 gene to
chromosome 1p36.11-p34.3 based on sequence similarity between the WASF2
sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB026542) and the chromosome 1 clone RP1-144C9
(GenBank GENBANK AL096774). The related sequence on the X chromosome may
be a pseudogene.

ANIMAL MODEL

By a targeted gene disruption, Yamazaki et al. (2003) generated mice
deficient in Wave2, which is expressed predominantly in vascular
endothelial cells during embryogenesis. Wave2 null embryos showed
hemorrhages and died at approximately embryonic day 10. Deficiency in
Wave2 had no significant effect on vasculogenesis, but it decreased
sprouting and branching of endothelial cells from existing vessels
during angiogenesis. In Wave2 null endothelial cells, cell polarity
formed in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (192240), but
the formation of lamellipodia at leading edges and capillaries was
severely impaired. Yamazaki et al. (2003) concluded that WAVE2-regulated
actin reorganization might be required for proper cell movement and that
a lack of functional WAVE2 impairs angiogenesis in vivo.

607698	TITLE *607698 LIGAND-DEPENDENT NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COREPRESSOR; LCOR
;;MBLK1-RELATED PROTEIN 2; MLR2;;
KIAA1795
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LCOR is a transcriptional corepressor widely expressed in fetal and
adult tissues that is recruited to agonist-bound nuclear receptors
through a single LxxLL motif, also referred to as a nuclear receptor
(NR) box (Fernandes et al., 2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned LCOR, which they called KIAA1795.
The deduced KIAA1795 protein contains 572 amino acids. RT-PCR followed
by ELISA detected highest expression in liver, testis, and ovary,
followed by kidney and brain. Within brain, highest expression was
detected in amygdala, corpus callosum, and caudate nucleus.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a fetal kidney cDNA library using the
ligand-binding domain of ESR1 (133430) as bait, followed by screening a
prostate cDNA library and searching EST databases, Fernandes et al.
(2003) cloned LCOR. The predicted 433-amino acid LCOR protein has a
calculated molecular mass of approximately 47 kD. It contains an LxxLL
motif, a nuclear localization signal, and a helix-loop-helix domain.
Northern blot analysis detected broad expression of LCOR transcripts at
varying levels in human adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression
in placenta, cerebellum and corpus callosum of brain, adult kidney, and
a number of fetal tissues.

Kunieda et al. (2003) cloned mouse Lcor, which they called Mlr2, based
on its homology with the honeybee transcription factor Mblk1. The
deduced 433-amino acid protein contains a DNA-binding motif and a motif
conserved in Mlr1 (LCORL; 611799). Northern blot analysis detected
expression of Mlr2 in mouse kidney, liver, and heart, with weak
expression in brain and no expression in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Fernandes et al. (2003) determined that binding of LCOR to ESR1 depends
in part on residues in the coactivator-binding pocket of ESR1 distinct
from those bound by TIF2 (601993). Repression by LCOR could be abolished
by histone deacetylase (HDAC; see 601241) inhibitor trichostatin A in a
receptor-dependent fashion, indicating HDAC-dependent and -independent
modes of action. LCOR bound directly to specific HDACs in vitro and in
vivo. Moreover, LCOR was shown to function by recruiting
C-terminal-binding protein (CTBP; see 602618) corepressors through 2
consensus binding motifs and to colocalize with CTBPs in the nucleus.
Fernandes et al. (2003) concluded that LCOR represents a class of
corepressor that attenuates agonist-activated nuclear receptor signaling
by multiple mechanisms.

Using a reporter gene assay, Kunieda et al. (2003) showed that mouse
Mlr2 bound and activated transcription from the DNA element recognized
by honeybee Mblk1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fernandes et al. (2003) determined that the LCOR gene contains 7 exons,
including 4 short 5-prime untranslated region exons that contain several
in-frame stop codons.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the LCOR gene to chromosome 10 by radiation
hybrid analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Fernandes et al. (2003)
mapped the LCOR gene to chromosome 10q24.1.

120260	TITLE *120260 COLLAGEN, TYPE IX, ALPHA-2; COL9A2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The COL9A2 gene encodes the alpha-2 subunit of collagen type IX. Type IX
collagen, a heterotrimer of alpha-1 (COL9A1; 120210), alpha-2, and
alpha-3 (COL9A3; 120270) chains specific for this type of collagen, is a
cartilage-specific fibril-associated collagen (Perala et al., 1993).

CLONING

In the process of characterizing genomic clones for the mouse COL9A2
gene, Perala et al. (1993) also used 4 pairs of oligonucleotide primers
designed for amplification of murine exon sequences to construct cDNA
clones for the human gene spanning more than 90% of the coding region.
The amino acid and nucleotide sequence identities between human and
chick are 78 and 71%, respectively.

MAPPING

Perala et al. (1993) assigned the human COL9A2 gene to chromosome 1 by
study of a panel of DNAs from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids.

Warman et al. (1994) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to
regionalize the COL9A2 gene to 1p33-p32.3. A single-strand conformation
polymorphism within the murine gene was used to map Col9a2 to mouse
chromosome 4. Since one form of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (EDM2;
600204) maps to the same region of chromosome 1, COL9A2 was considered
to be a candidate gene for that disorder.

Hellsten et al. (1995) demonstrated that the COL9A2 gene is in a 1-Mb
contig, proximal to RLF (180610) and MYCL1 (164850).

GENE FUNCTION

The cartilage collagen fibrils are formed from fibrillar collagens II
and XI (120280), while collagen IX is located on the fibril surface (see
Figure 2 in Muragaki et al., 1996). The alpha-1(IX) chain contains a
large N-terminal globular domain (NC4); a chondroitin sulfate chain is
attached to the alpha-2(IX) chain (Muragaki et al., 1996).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia 2

The usefulness of the candidate gene approach for identification of a
basic gene defect was illustrated by the finding of a mutation in the
COL9A2 gene (120260.0001) in a Dutch kindred with multiple epiphyseal
dysplasia 2 (EDM2; 600204) showing linkage to DNA markers in the region
of 1p32 (Muragaki et al., 1996). Muragaki et al. (1996) stated that the
results provided by the EDM2 'experiment of nature' represent the first
in vivo evidence for the role of collagen IX in human articular
cartilage.

Holden et al. (1999) described 2 families with distinctive
oligoepiphyseal forms of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, in which
heterozygosity for different mutations in the COL9A2 gene (120260.0002
and 120260.0003) was found. Both of these mutations resulted in the
skipping of exon 3 from the COL9A2 mRNA, but the position of the
mutation in the splice donor site determined the stability of the mRNA
produced from the mutant allele.

- Intervertebral Disc Disease

In Finnish individuals with sciatica and radiologically documented
intervertebral disc disease (IDD; 603932), Annunen et al. (1999)
identified a mutation in the COL9A2 gene (120260.0004).

- Stickler Syndrome V

In a large 5-generation consanguineous pedigree of Asian Indian origin
segregating autosomal recessive Stickler syndrome (STL5; 614284), Baker
et al. (2011) analyzed 3 candidate collagen IX-related genes and
identified homozygosity for an 8-bp deletion in the COL9A2 gene
(120260.0006) that segregated with disease in the family.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, T-C, +2

Muragaki et al. (1996) demonstrated a mutation in affected members of a
family with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (600204) that showed linkage
to the 1p32 region. Affected members were heterozygous for a splice site
mutation causing exon skipping during RNA splicing and an in-frame loss
of 12 amino acids within the alpha-2 (IX) collagen chain. The results
provided the first in vivo evidence for the role of collagen IX in human
articular cartilage. The clinical findings in the family were entirely
characteristic of MED although hip complaints were less conspicuous than
in many kindreds. The specific mutation was a T-to-C transition in the
consensus donor splice site of intron 3, resulting in the skipping of
exon 3.

Jackson et al. (2010) reported a large 4-generation family with
autosomal dominant transmission of EDM2 associated with the T-to-C
transition in intron 3 (186+2T-C) of the COL9A2 gene. The family had
previously been reported by Versteylen et al. (1988). The proband was a
33-year-old woman with short stature who complained of stiff and painful
hands and knees since age 4 years. Radiographs of the knees showed
Blount disease (progressive varus deformity of the proximal tibia
associated with internal torsion of the tibia) and of the spine showed
mild spondyloarthrotic abnormalities in the thoracic region. Her sister
had painful and swollen knees since age 4 years and developed severe
osteochondritis dissecans as an adult. Two sons of the proband were also
affected, showing pain in the knees during walking and clumsy walking.
These boys also had frontal bossing, depressed nasal bridge, and were
easily fatigued with mild muscle weakness. Radiographs of 1 son at age 3
years showed delayed ossification of the epiphyses, small proximal
femoral epiphyses, and small femoral and tibial epiphyses around the
knees. Skeletal muscle biopsy and mitochondrial studies showed no
significant abnormalities, only mild variations in fiber size and
slightly diminished ATP production. Jackson et al. (2010) commented on
the mild myopathy present in the boys, and noted that EDM is
characterized by clinical variability even within the same family. The
mild myopathic and mitochondrial changes observed may be secondary to a
tendonopathy and/or cell stress response resulting from expression of
mutant collagen.

.0002
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, 186G-A

In family K of Holden et al. (1999) with EDM2 (600204) the proband was a
17-year-old male of normal height who was diagnosed in childhood with
pain in the joints, mostly the knees, and genu varum. Radiographs showed
major epiphyseal changes in the knees and hands, and almost no changes
in the hips. The spine also appeared normal. The molecular change was a
G-to-A transition in the last nucleotide of exon 3, changing the last
codon of exon 3 from CCG (pro) to CCA (also pro). Although there was no
change in the amino acid, the change interfered with splicing.

Nakashima et al. (2005) identified the exon 3 G-to-A transition in the
COL9A2 gene in affected members of a Japanese family with EDM2. The
proband had bilateral double-layered patellae, indicating that this
unusual feature is not unique to autosomal recessive multiple epiphyseal
dysplasia with homozygous mutations in the DTDST gene (606718; see EDM4
226900).

Jackson et al. (2010) reported a patient with EDM2 characterized by
onset at age 3 years of an abnormal gait associated with proximal muscle
weakness. He had left-sided developmental dysplasia of the hip. The
family history was positive for hypodontia and for osteochondritis
dissecans. However, 2 affected adult family members showed improvement
of the disorder after puberty. The proband was heterozygous for the
186G-A transition in the splice donor sequence of exon 3 of the COL9A2
gene.

.0003
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, G-C, +5

Family G reported by Holden et al. (1999) with an oligoepiphyseal form
of MED (600204) and a mutation in the COL9A2 gene had affected members
in 4 generations, of whom a mother and her 2 sons were available for
study. They were slightly short in stature (adult height, 158 cm), and
all 3 developed genu valgum, which required surgical correction. The
mother started walking late and with a stiff gait that became more
noticeable during ages 5 to 7 years. Her legs became increasingly bowed,
and at age 17 she underwent tibial osteotomy. She had developed
increasing problems with pain in her hands, lumbar spine, and ankles.
Her 2 sons walked at age 2 years with a stiff gait. Epiphyseal dysplasia
was recognized in them in early childhood, and they underwent tibial
osteotomy for genu valgum at ages 14 and 13, respectively. They
continued to have mild joint symptoms, including intermittent lumbar
back pain and knee pain with swelling. Changes were not found clinically
or radiographically in the hips. Affected members showed heterozygosity
for a G-to-C transversion at position +5 of intron 3.

INTERVERTEBRAL DISC DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
COL9A2, GLN326TRP

In a study that examined for allelic variation in the COL9A2 gene in
Finnish individuals with sciatica and radiologically documented
intervertebral disc disease (IDD; 603932), Annunen et al. (1999) found a
substitution of tryptophan for glutamine at codon 326. This change was
found in 6 of 157 individuals with disc disease but in none of 174
controls. Further analysis of the families of 4 of the original patients
revealed that all individuals heterozygous for the trp substitution
demonstrated the disease phenotype. Many individuals within these
families had IDD but not the trp allele. The authors invoked a high
phenocopy rate to reconcile this observation with the conclusion that
this sequence variant within COL9A2 contributes to the pathogenesis of
disease. In the disease model chosen, this locus accounted for 10% of
disease prevalence. Under these constraints, Annunen et al. (1999)
demonstrated a lod score of 4.5 at a recombination fraction of 0.12.
Subsequent linkage disequilibrium analysis conditional on linkage gave
an additional lod score of 7.1. The authors did not exclude the
possibility that a true disease locus may lie in close physical
proximity to COL9A2.

.0005
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, 2
COL9A2, IVS3DS, G-C, -1

In 12 affected members from a 4-generation family with a relatively
hip-sparing EDM2 phenotype (600204), Fiedler et al. (2002) identified a
G-to-C mutation in the last nucleotide of exon 3 of the COL9A2 gene. The
disorder was characterized by childhood onset of pain and stiffness in
the knees. Finger joints, ankles, and elbows became symptomatic during
early adult life. Some adult patients had free articular bodies which
resulted in locking of the joints. Fiedler et al. (2002) noted that a
G-to-A change at the same nucleotide had earlier been found to cause
EDM2 (120260.0002).

.0006
STICKLER SYNDROME V
COL9A2, 8-BP DEL, NT843

In an affected sister and brother from a large 5-generation
consanguineous pedigree of Asian Indian origin segregating autosomal
recessive Stickler syndrome (STL5; 614284), Baker et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for an 8-bp deletion in the COL9A2 gene
involving the last 4 nucleotides of exon 16 and the first 4 nucleotides
of IVS16 (843_846+4del8). The deletion was predicted to cause a
frameshift and downstream premature termination codon (asp281glnfsX70).
The mutation was detected in heterozygosity in the sibs' unaffected
brother and parents.

606916	TITLE *606916 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 61; GPR61
;;BIOGENIC AMINE RECEPTOR-LIKE GPCR; BALGR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, or GPRs) contain 7 transmembrane
domains and transduce extracellular signals through heterotrimeric G
proteins.

CLONING

By PCR of genomic DNA, Lee et al. (2001) obtained a partial GPR61 clone
using primers designed from the sequence of a rabbit G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR). They used the PCR products to screen a human brain cDNA
library and found that GPR61 encodes a 417-amino acid protein that
shares over 80% identity with the rabbit homolog and 44% similarity with
GPR62 (606917) in the transmembrane region. By Northern blot analysis of
human brain areas, Lee et al. (2001) detected a 4.3-kb transcript in
caudate, putamen, and thalamus, but not in hypothalamus, hippocampus,
pons, frontal cortex, or cerebellum. No expression was found in liver or
kidney. Lee et al. (2001) also cloned rat GPR61 and, by in situ
hybridization, found widespread expression in rat brain.

Cikos et al. (2001) independently cloned GPR61, which they called BALGR.
A partial sequence was obtained by RT-PCR of human brain mRNA using
degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to a transmembrane sequence of
GPR30 (601805). They cloned the full-length cDNA from a hypothalamus
cDNA library. They found that the deduced protein contains 451 amino
acids and has a calculated molecular mass of about 49 kD. GPR61 contains
7 putative transmembrane domains, a potential N-glycosylation site,
cysteine residues that may form a disulfide bridge, and several putative
protein kinase sites. It also contains a conserved glu-arg-tyr sequence
shared with other GPCRs. The highest sequence similarity (28-31%) was
found with biogenic amine GPCRs, i.e., serotonin, histamine, adrenergic,
and dopamine GPCRs. By semiquantitative PCR of multiple human tissues,
Cikos et al. (2001) found highest expression in brain and testes and low
but detectable expression in all other tissues examined. Their results
of Northern blot analysis of human brain regions differed from that
reported by Lee et al. (2001). Strong expression of a 4.8-kb transcript
was found in cerebral cortex, occipital pole, frontal lobe, temporal
lobe, amygdala, and hippocampus, and lower expression in putamen and
caudate nucleus. No message was detected in cerebellum, medulla
oblongata, spinal cord, corpus callosum, substantia nigra, subthalamic
nucleus, or thalamus.

MAPPING

By PCR using a human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panel as template, Cikos
et al. (2001) mapped the GPR61 gene to chromosome 1.

131320	TITLE *131320 GATA-BINDING PROTEIN 3; GATA3
;;ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN GATA3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The genes for all 4 subunits of the T-cell antigen receptor (alpha,
186880; beta, 186930; gamma, 186970; and delta, 186810) are controlled
by distinct enhancers and their enhancer-binding proteins. Marine and
Winoto (1991) identified a common TCR regulatory element by
demonstrating binding of the enhancer-binding protein GATA3 to the
enhancer elements of all 4 TCR genes. GATA3 had been shown in the
chicken to be an enhancer-binding protein containing a zinc finger
domain. GATA3 mRNA was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis in T cells
but not in B cells, macrophages, or HeLa cell lines. GATA3 was
abundantly expressed in the T-lymphocyte lineage and was thought to
participate in T-cell receptor gene activation through binding to
enhancers. Labastie et al. (1994) cloned the human gene and the 5-prime
end of the mouse gene. The 2 zinc fingers of GATA3 are encoded by 2
separate exons highly conserved with those of GATA1 (305371), but no
other structural homologies between the 2 genes could be found.

GENE STRUCTURE

Labastie et al. (1994) determined that the human GATA3 gene contains 6
exons distributed over 17 kb of DNA.

MAPPING

Joulin et al. (1991) mapped the human GATA3 gene to chromosome 10p15 by
in situ hybridization, and Copeland et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Gata3
gene to chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

CD4 (186940) T cells potentiate the inflammatory or humoral immune
response through the action of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. Zheng
and Flavell (1997) found that GATA3 was expressed at a high level in
naive, freshly activated cells and Th2 lineage cells, but subsided to a
minimal level in Th1 lineage cells as naive cells committed to their Th
subset. Antisense GATA3 inhibited the expression of all Th2 cytokine
genes in a Th2 clone. In transgenic mice, elevated GATA3 and CD4 T cells
caused Th2 cytokine gene expression in developing Th1 cells. Thus, Zheng
and Flavell (1997) concluded that GATA3 is necessary and sufficient for
Th2 cytokine gene expression.

Interleukin-5 (IL5; 147850) plays a central role in the growth and
differentiation of eosinophils and contributes to several disease
states, including asthma. There is evidence for a role for cyclic AMP as
an immunomodulator: agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels
inhibit production of cytokines predominantly produced by T-alpha-1
(Th1) cells such as IL2 (147680) and interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). In
contrast, the production of IL5, predominantly produced by Th2 cells, is
enhanced by these agents. Siegel et al. (1995) defined precisely the
cis-activating elements that regulate inducible murine Il5
transcription: sequences within the CLE0 element and also a region
located between -70 and -59 of the IL5 promoter that binds the
transcription factor Gata3. They speculated that activation via this
unique sequence combination confers the specificity needed for selective
expression of the IL5 gene in response to elevated levels of
intracellular cAMP.

Zhang et al. (1997) demonstrated that GATA3 is critical for expression
of the IL5 gene in Th2 cells. Whereas mutations in the GATA3 site
abolished antigen- or cAMP-stimulated IL5 promoter activation in Th2
cells, ectopic expression of GATA3 in Th1 cells or in a nonlymphoid,
non-IL5-producing cell line activated the IL5 promoter. Other findings
suggested that GATA3 gene expression may play an important role in the
balance between Th1 and Th2 subsets in immune responses. Zhang et al.
(1997) suggested that inhibition of GATA3 activity has therapeutic
potential in the treatment of asthma and other hypereosinophilic
diseases.

Zhang et al. (1998) showed that ectopic expression of GATA3 is
sufficient to drive IL5 but not IL4 gene (147780) expression. Also, in
Th2 cells, antisense GATA3 RNA inhibits IL5 but not IL4 promoter
activation. The induction of IL5 gene expression by GATA3 involves high
affinity binding of GATA3 to an inverted GATA repeat in the IL5
promoter.

Nakamura et al. (1999) found increased GATA3 gene expression in
association with cells showing an increase in IL5 mRNA in asthmatic
airways. They interpreted these findings as supporting a causal
association between augmented GATA3 expression and dysregulated IL5
expression in atopic asthma.

Tong et al. (2000) showed that murine Gata2 and Gata3 are specifically
expressed in white adipocyte precursors and that their downregulation
sets the stage for terminal differentiation. Constitutive Gata2 and
Gata3 expression suppressed adipocyte differentiation and trapped cells
at the preadipocyte stage. This effect was mediated, at least in part,
through the direct suppression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma (PPARG; 601487). Gata3-deficient embryonic stem cells
exhibit an enhanced capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, and
defective Gata2 and Gata3 expression is associated with obesity. Thus,
Tong et al. (2000) concluded that GATA2 and GATA3 regulate adipocyte
differentiation through molecular control of the preadipocyte-adipocyte
transition.

Fields et al. (2002) noted that high levels of histone acetylation at
particular loci correlate with transcriptional activity, whereas reduced
levels correlate with silencing. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP), PCR, and green fluorescent protein analysis, they demonstrated
that histones in the cytokine loci (IFNG and IL4) of naive T cells are
unacetylated, but upon TCR stimulation, the loci are rapidly and
progressively acetylated on histones H3 and H4. The acetylation at the
IL4 locus occurs early, regardless of Th1/Th2 polarizing conditions,
correlating with early transcription. The maintenance of acetylation
depends on cytokine and STAT4 (600558) and STAT6 (601512) signaling and
also on the transactivator activity of TBET (604895) and GATA3, the
putative 'master regulators' of Th lineage determination.

Hwang et al. (2005) reported that TBET represses Th2 lineage commitment
through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between itself and GATA3
that interferes with the binding of GATA3 to its target DNA. Hwang et
al. (2005) concluded that their results provide a novel function for
tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in specifying
alternate fates of a common progenitor cell. Hwang et al. (2005) showed
that TBET phosphorylation is restricted to the TEC kinases ITK (186973)
and RLK (600058). Coexpression studies demonstrated that this was most
efficiently performed by ITK. In primary CD4 T cells isolated from ITK-,
RLK-, or double ITK/RLK-deficient mice, the greatest diminution of TBET
tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in the absence of ITK. Furthermore,
mutation of TBET at tyrosine residue 525, but not control tyrosine
residue 437, resulted in greatly reduced phosphorylation by ITK,
revealing that ITK phosphorylates TBET at residue Y525 after T cell
receptor stimulation.

Chen et al. (2006) noted that activated T cells, particularly Th1 cells,
express sialyl Lewis x, but resting T cells do not. Using reporter
analysis, they showed that TBET promoted and GATA3 repressed
transcription of FUT7 (602030), the rate-limiting enzyme for sialyl
Lewis x synthesis. TBET interfered with GATA3 binding to its target DNA,
but GATA3 also interfered with TBET binding to the FUT7 promoter. GATA3
regulated FUT7 transcription by recruiting, in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner, histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3; 605166)
and HDAC5 (605315) and by competing with CBP (CREBBP; 600140)/p300
(EP300; 602700) in binding to the N terminus of TBET. Maximal expression
of FUT7 and sialyl Lewis x in T cells was obtained by ROG (ZBTB32;
605859)-mediated suppression of GATA3. Chen et al. (2006) concluded that
the GATA3/TBET transcription factor complex regulates cell
lineage-specific expression of lymphocyte homing receptors and that
glycoconjugates are regulated by this complex to attain cell
lineage-specific expression in Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte subsets.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Terminal deletions of chromosome 10p result in a DiGeorge (188400)-like
phenotype that includes hypoparathyroidism, heart defects, immune
deficiency, deafness, and renal malformations. One region that
contributes to this complex phenotype is that for the syndrome of
hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal insufficiency
(HDRS; 146255). Van Esch et al. (2000) performed deletion-mapping
studies in 2 HDRS patients and defined a critical 200-kb region that
contains the GATA3 gene. Search for GATA3 mutations in 3 other HDR
probands identified 1 nonsense mutation (131320.0005) and 2 intragenic
deletions (131320.0003, 131320.0004) that predicted a loss of function,
as confirmed by absence of DNA binding by the mutant GATA3 protein.
These results demonstrated that GATA3 is essential in the embryonic
development of the parathyroids, auditory system, and kidneys, and
showed that GATA3 haploinsufficiency causes human HDR syndrome.

Muroya et al. (2001) studied 9 Japanese families with HDR syndrome. FISH
and microsatellite analysis showed heterozygous deletions including
GATA3 in 4 families. Sequence analysis showed heterozygous novel
mutations in 3 families, including a missense mutation in exon 4
(131320.0006), an insertion mutation (131320.0007), and a nonsense
mutation in exon 6 (131320.0008).

In 10 patients with HDR syndrome from 7 unrelated families, Nesbit et
al. (2004) identified and characterized 7 mutations in exons 3 through 6
of the GATA3 gene. Using electrophoretic mobility shift, dissociation,
yeast 2-hybrid, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, Nesbit
et al. (2004) demonstrated that mutations involving the C-terminal zinc
finger (ZnF2) or adjacent basic amino acids result in a loss of DNA
binding, but those of the N-terminal zinc finger (ZnF1) either lead to a
loss of interaction with specific zinc finger proteins of FOG2 (ZFPM2;
603693) or alter DNA-binding affinity.

Hernandez et al. (2007) reported a mother and daughter with HDR and
female genital tract malformations in whom they identified a deletion in
the GATA3 gene (131320.0009).

Chiu et al. (2006) sequenced the CASR (601199) and GATA3 genes in 5
unrelated Chinese families with familial hypoparathyroidism. They
identified 3 novel mutations in the GATA3 gene responsible for familial
hypoparathyroidism and deafness. Except for a previously described
polymorphism, they found no genetic variants in the CASR gene.

Ali et al. (2007) analyzed the GATA3 gene in 21 HDR probands and 14
patients with isolated hypoparathyroidism (see FIH, 146200); no
mutations were found in the FIH patients, but 13 different heterozygous
germline mutations were identified in the HDR probands, including 1
missense, 1 splice site, 3 nonsense, and 8 frameshift mutations. EMSA
analysis revealed 3 classes of GATA3 mutations: those involving of loss
of DNA binding due to loss of the C-terminal zinc finger, which
represent over 90% of mutations reported in GATA3; those resulting in
reduced DNA-binding affinity; and those that do not alter DNA binding or
affinity but likely alter the conformation change that occurs during
binding in the DNA major groove, as predicted by 3-dimensional modeling.

In a 14-year-old boy with neurologic symptoms in addition to the HDR
triad of hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal
dysplasia, who did not have any microdeletion in the 22q11.2 or 10p14
regions by FISH analysis, Ferraris et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous de novo 2-bp deletion (131320.0013) in exon2 of the GATA3
gene. The authors concluded that haploinsufficiency of GATA3 may be
responsible for a complex neurologic picture in addition to the known
triad of HDR syndrome.

In a 29-year-old Portuguese with severe hypoparathyroidism, bilateral
mild neurosensory deafness, and agenesis of the vagina and uterus but no
kidney abnormalities, Moldovan et al. (2011) analyzed the GATA3 gene and
identified a heterozygous missense mutation (C342Y; 131320.0014). The
authors noted that this patient, along with the mother and daughter with
HDR and female genital tract malformations studied by Hernandez et al.
(2007), seemed to confirm the role of GATA3 in regulating developmental
mechanisms of the uterus and vagina.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lim et al. (2000) found that null mutations of Gata3 in mice led to a
reduced accumulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 191290) and dopamine
beta-hydroxylase (DPH; 223360) mRNA, whereas several other sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) genes were unaffected. They showed that Th and Dbh
deficiencies led to reduced noradrenalin in the SNS, and that
noradrenaline deficiency was the proximal cause of death in mutants by
feeding catechol intermediates to pregnant dams, thereby partially
averting Gata3 mutation-induced lethality. The older, pharmacologically
rescued mutants showed abnormalities that could not be detected in
untreated mutants. These late embryonic defects included renal
hypoplasia and developmental defects in structures derived from cephalic
neural crest cells. Thus, Lim et al. (2000) showed that Gata3 has a role
in the differentiation of multiple cell lineages during embryogenesis.

To elucidate GATA3 function, Pandolfi et al. (1995) disrupted the mouse
gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice
heterozygous for the Gata3 mutation were found to be fertile and
appeared in all respects to be normal, whereas homozygous mutant embryos
died between days 11 and 12 postcoitum and displayed massive internal
bleeding, marked growth retardation, severe deformities of the brain and
spinal cord, and gross aberrations in fetal liver hematopoiesis. The
functions of GATA1 and GATA2 (137295) had previously been studied by
comparable methods. The results in aggregate demonstrated that each
GATA-binding protein has a unique and essential function during the
development of the mouse embryo. In each case, targeted mutagenesis also
revealed surprising roles for each factor, underscoring the power of
this experimental approach: GATA1 is essential for erythroid cell
development, while disruption of GATA2 indicates a function during very
early events in the development of all blood cell lineages.

Using microarray analysis, Kaufman et al. (2003) identified Gata3 as an
induced transcription factor in embryonic day-13 to -18.5 mouse skin.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed Gata3 expression in
early vibrissae follicles and later in developing epidermis and in the
cone of presumptive inner root sheath (IRS) precursor cells within hair
follicles. Examination of pharmacologically rescued Gata3 -/- embryos
and grafted Gata3 -/- skin showed aberrations in hair follicle
morphogenesis that included not only structural defects in the IRS and
hair shaft, but also molecular defects in cell lineage determination.
Kaufman et al. (2003) concluded that, along with LEF1 (153245) and WNTs
(see 164820), GATA3 is at the crossroads of both lymphocyte
differentiation and of the IRS versus hair shaft cell fate decision in
hair follicle morphogenesis.

Pai et al. (2003) generated mice conditionally lacking Gata3 at early
(double-negative) and late (double-positive) stages of thymic
differentiation. They found that Gata3 was indispensable for thymocytes
to pass through beta selection, the process by which T-cell
receptor-beta is paired with pre-T-cell receptor-alpha, a requirement
for double-negative stage-3 cell survival. Furthermore, Gata3 was
required for single-positive Cd4 thymocyte development. Pai et al.
(2003) concluded that continued expression of GATA3 is required at
multiple stages of thymocyte differentiation.

Zhu et al. (2004) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Gata3
and Gata3-deficient mouse T-cell lines and found that both Il4-dependent
and -independent Th2 differentiation was diminished, permitting Th1
differentiation in the absence of Ifng and Il12 (see 161561). Deletion
of Gata3 from established Th2 cells abolished production of Il5 and Il13
(147683), but not of Il4. Mice lacking Gata3 produced Ifng rather than
Th2 cytokines in response to infection with Nippostrongylus
brasiliensis. Zhu et al. (2004) concluded that Gata3 serves as a
principal switch in determining Th1-Th2 responses.

Van der Wees et al. (2004) analyzed auditory brainstem response
thresholds in heterozygous Gata3-knockout mice from 1 to 19 months of
age and demonstrated a hearing loss of 30 dB compared to wildtype
littermates. No physiologic or morphologic abnormalities were found in
the brainstem, cerebral cortex, or the outer or middle ear. However, the
cochleae of Gata3 +/- mice showed significant progressive morphologic
degeneration starting with the outer hair cells at the apex and
ultimately involving all hair cells and supporting cells in the entire
cochlea. Van der Wees et al. (2004) concluded that hearing loss
following GATA3 haploinsufficiency is peripheral in nature and that this
defect is detectable from early postnatal development and continues
through adulthood.

Kouros-Mehr et al. (2006) found that Gata3 was the most highly enriched
transcription factor in mammary epithelium of pubertal mice. Conditional
deletion of Gata3 led to severe defects in mammary development due to
failure in terminal end bud formation during puberty. After acute Gata3
loss, adult mice exhibited undifferentiated luminal cell expansion with
basement-membrane detachment, which led to caspase (see CASP1;
147678)-mediated cell death.

In a mother and her son with HDR syndrome (146255), Van Esch et al.
(2000) identified a nonsense mutation at nucleotide 828 of the GATA3
gene, a C-to-T transition resulting in an arginine-to-ter substitution
at residue 277 (R277X). This mutation was predicted to result in a

In a Japanese family with HDR syndrome (146255), Muroya et al. (2001)
identified a 2-bp insertion at nucleotide 900 and a 3-bp insertion at
nucleotide 901 in exon 4 of the GATA3 gene (900insAA plus 901insCCT, or
C901AACCCT), resulting in premature termination at codon 357 with loss
of the second zinc finger domain.

GATA3, ARG367TER

In a 33-year-old Japanese man who had hypoparathyroidism, wore hearing
aids, and had proteinuria and hematuria (HDR syndrome; 146255), Muroya
et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for a 1099C-T transition in exon
6 of the GATA3 gene, resulting in an arg367-to-ter (R367X) substitution.
The mutation was also detected in his 3-year-old daughter, who did not
have hypoparathyroidism or renal dysplasia, but was clinically suspected
of hearing loss due to speech delay.

In an 18-year-old Han Chinese boy and his 5-year-old sister, who both
had hypoparathyroidism and bilateral sensorineural deafness but no renal
dysplasia, Sun et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for the R367X
mutation in the GATA3 gene. The mutation was not found in either of
their unaffected parents; Sun et al. (2009) concluded that 1 of the
parents likely had germinal mosaicism of the mutant GATA3 gene.

In a mother and daughter with HDR syndrome (146255), Hernandez et al.
(2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (431delG) in exon 3
of the GATA3 gene, causing a frameshift at codon 144 and resulting in a
termination signal at codon 194. The mother had a nonfunctional right
kidney and a septate uterus, whereas her daughter had right renal

4/intron 4 boundary (IVS4+2T-GCTTACTTCCC) that was predicted to lead to
truncated GATA3 proteins lacking both N- and C-terminal zinc-containing
fingers.

In affected members of a Chinese family with HDR syndrome (146255), Chiu
et al. (2006) detected an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 1059 in exon
6 of the GATA3 gene that resulted in an arg353-to-ser (R353S)
substitution. The mutation was predicted to disrupt the helical turn and
thus changed the angle between the C-terminal zinc finger and the
adjacent C-terminal tail.

146255), Ferraris et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a de novo
2-bp deletion (108delGG) in exon 2 of the GATA3 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and a premature stop codon after a new 15-amino acid
sequence. The unaffected parents did not carry the mutation, which was
also not found in 100 controls. Neurologic involvement included basal
ganglia calcifications, palpebral ptosis, postural strabismus,
horizontal nystagmus, and pseudopapilledema.

HYPOPARATHYROIDISM, SENSORINEURAL DEAFNESS, AND RENAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
GATA3, CYS342TYR

In a 29-year-old Portuguese woman with severe hypoparathyroidism,
bilateral mild neurosensory deafness, and agenesis of the vagina and
uterus but no kidney abnormalities (see 146255), Moldovan et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for a 1025G-A transition in exon 5 of the
GATA3 gene, resulting in a cys342-to-tyr (C342Y) substitution at a
highly conserved residue within the functionally important zinc finger-2
domain. The parents were unavailable for study, but there was no family
history of the disease.

138250	TITLE *138250 ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 18 FAMILY, MEMBER A1; ALDH18A1
;;1-@PYRROLINE-5-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHETASE; PYCS;;
P5CS;;
GLUTAMATE GAMMA-SEMIALDEHYDE SYNTHETASE; GSAS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) catalyzes the ATP- and
NADPH-dependent conversion of L-glutamate to glutamic
gamma-semialdehyde, which is the metabolic precursor for proline
biosynthesis.

CLONING

By a method they referred to as 'database cloning,' Aral et al. (1996)
isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding the human P5CS gene.

Hu et al. (1999) observed that mammalian P5CS undergoes alternative
splicing to generate 2 isoforms differing only by a 2-amino acid insert
at the N terminus of the gamma-glutamyl kinase active site. The short
isoform has high activity in the gut, where it participates in arginine
biosynthesis and is inhibited by ornithine. The long isoform, expressed
in multiple tissues, is necessary for the synthesis of proline from
glutamate and is insensitive to ornithine.

MAPPING

Jones (1975) presented evidence from cell hybrid studies that the
structural gene for the enzyme converting glutamate to its gamma
semialdehyde is located on chromosome 10. The fact that
glutamate-gamma-semialdehyde synthetase (GSAS) and glutamate
oxaloacetate transaminase (138180) are in the same biochemical pathway
and determined by genes on the same chromosome may have biologic
significance (Jones, 1975).

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Liu et al. (1996) mapped the PYCS
gene to 10q24.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Baumgartner et al. (2000) observed homozygosity for a missense mutation
in P5CS in the 2 sibs described by Rabier et al. (1992) with mental
retardation, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, cataract, and
metabolic abnormalities, including hyperammonemia, hypoprolinemia,
hypocitrullinemia, and hypoornithinemia (ARCL3A; 219150). The
arg84-to-gln mutation (R84Q; 138250.0001) alters a conserved residue in
the P5CS gamma-glutamyl kinase domain and dramatically reduces the
activity of both P5CS isoforms when expressed in mammalian cells.
Additionally, R84Q appears to destabilize the long isoform.

In affected individuals from a New Zealand family with mental
retardation, joint hypermobility, and skin laxity without metabolic
abnormalities, Bicknell et al. (2008) identified a homozygous mutation
in the ALDH18A1 gene (H784Y; 138250.0002). In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the H784Y mutant protein retained
normal P5CS activity and did not impair proline synthesis. The findings
indicated that impaired enzymatic activity does not account for the
phenotype, as was suggested for the patients reported by Baumgartner et
al. (2000).

Skidmore et al. (2011) reported a child born of a consanguineous union
with features consistent with De Barsy syndrome (ARCL3A) with homozygous
mutation in the ALDH18A1 gene (138250.0003).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, ARG84GLN

Baumgartner et al. (2000) determined that the 2 sibs reported by Rabier
et al. (1992) with mental retardation, joint hypermobility, skin laxity,
cataracts, and metabolic abnormalities (219150) were homozygous for a
251G-A transition of the PYCS gene, resulting in an arg84-to-gln (R84Q)
substitution. The mutation impairs the function of both the long and
short isoforms of PYCS.

.0002
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, HIS784TYR

In 4 affected sibs, born of consanguineous New Zealand Maori parents,
with mental retardation, joint hypermobility, skin laxity without
metabolic abnormalities (219150), Bicknell et al. (2008) identified a
homozygous 2350C-T transition in exon 18 of the ALDH18A1 gene, resulting
in a his784-to-tyr (H784Y) substitution in a conserved residue in the
C-terminal motif. In vitro functional expression studies indicated that
the H784Y-mutant protein retained normal P5CS activity and did not
impair proline synthesis. The findings indicated that impaired enzymatic
activity does not account for the phenotype.

.0003
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IIIA
ALDH18A1, NT1923, G-A, +1

In a severely affected child with clinical features consistent with De
Barsy syndrome (219150), born to consanguineous parents of Pakistani
origin, Skidmore et al. (2011) reported homozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the exon 14-intron 14 boundary (nucleotide 1923+1) of the
ALDH18A1 gene. The mutation resulted in 2 anomalous transcripts that
were predicted to encode proteins lacking the catalytic site for the
enzyme. The cellular phenotype was characterized by diminished
production of collagens type I (see 120150) and III (see 120180),
altered elastin ultrastructure, and diminished cell proliferation of
cultured dermal fibroblasts. The child had lax, wrinkled, and thin skin
with dilated and tortuous subcutaneous blood vessels, corneal clouding,
and hypotonia. The child also had severe global developmental delay and
feeding difficulties, and died in infancy of unknown causes.

;;KIAA0459
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Seki et al. (1997) cloned OTUD3, which they designated
KIAA0459. The 3-prime end of the cDNA has a repetitive element, and the
deduced protein contains 153 amino acids. In vitro transcription and
translation resulted in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 20
kD by SDS-PAGE.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the OTUD3
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SGC32455).

604661	TITLE *604661 POTASSIUM CHANNEL-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2; KCNIP2
;;KCHIP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the brain and heart, rapidly inactivating (A-type) voltage-gated
potassium (Kv) currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to
control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes. An et al.
(2000) described 3 Kv channel-interacting proteins called KCHIPs that
bind to the cytoplasmic amino termini of Kv4-alpha subunits. See KCHIP1
(604660). The KCHIP2 cDNA encodes a 252-amino acid protein that has a
distinct amino terminus but shares approximately 70% amino acid identity
with KCHIP1 and KCHIP3 throughout a carboxy-terminal 185-amino acid core
domain containing 4 EF-hand-like motifs. Expression of KCHIP2 and Kv4
together reconstituted several features of native A-type currents by
modulating the density, inactivation kinetics, and rate of recovery from
inactivation of Kv4 channels in heterologous cells. The KCHIPs
colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with brain Kv4-alpha subunits and
are thus integral components of native Kv4 channel complexes.

GENE FUNCTION

Jeyaraj et al. (2012) provided molecular evidence that links circadian
rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice.
Specifically, they showed that cardiac ion channel expression and QT
interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit
endogenous circadian rhythmicity under the control of a clock-dependent
oscillator, Kruppel-like factor-15 (KLF15; 606465). Klf15
transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of KChIP2, a critical
subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current.
Deficiency or excess of Klf15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation,
abnormal repolarization, and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular
arrhythmias. Jeyaraj et al. (2012) concluded that their findings
identified circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for
cardiac arrhythmogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kuo et al. (2001) found that knockout mice deficient for Kchip2
exhibited normal cardiac structure and function but displayed a
prolonged elevation in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. The
Kchip2 -/- mice were highly susceptible to the induction of cardiac
arrhythmias. Single-cell analysis revealed a substrate for
arrhythmogenesis, including a complete absence of transient outward
potassium current (I-to) and a marked increase in action potential
duration. These studies demonstrated that a defect in KCHIP2 is
sufficient to confer a marked genetic susceptibility to arrhythmias,
establishing a novel genetic pathway for ventricular tachycardia via a
loss of the transmural gradient of I-to.

131320	TITLE *131320 GATA-BINDING PROTEIN 3; GATA3
;;ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN GATA3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The genes for all 4 subunits of the T-cell antigen receptor (alpha,
186880; beta, 186930; gamma, 186970; and delta, 186810) are controlled
by distinct enhancers and their enhancer-binding proteins. Marine and
Winoto (1991) identified a common TCR regulatory element by
demonstrating binding of the enhancer-binding protein GATA3 to the
enhancer elements of all 4 TCR genes. GATA3 had been shown in the
chicken to be an enhancer-binding protein containing a zinc finger
domain. GATA3 mRNA was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis in T cells
but not in B cells, macrophages, or HeLa cell lines. GATA3 was
abundantly expressed in the T-lymphocyte lineage and was thought to
participate in T-cell receptor gene activation through binding to
enhancers. Labastie et al. (1994) cloned the human gene and the 5-prime
end of the mouse gene. The 2 zinc fingers of GATA3 are encoded by 2
separate exons highly conserved with those of GATA1 (305371), but no
other structural homologies between the 2 genes could be found.

GENE STRUCTURE

Labastie et al. (1994) determined that the human GATA3 gene contains 6
exons distributed over 17 kb of DNA.

MAPPING

Joulin et al. (1991) mapped the human GATA3 gene to chromosome 10p15 by
in situ hybridization, and Copeland et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Gata3
gene to chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

CD4 (186940) T cells potentiate the inflammatory or humoral immune
response through the action of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. Zheng
and Flavell (1997) found that GATA3 was expressed at a high level in
naive, freshly activated cells and Th2 lineage cells, but subsided to a
minimal level in Th1 lineage cells as naive cells committed to their Th
subset. Antisense GATA3 inhibited the expression of all Th2 cytokine
genes in a Th2 clone. In transgenic mice, elevated GATA3 and CD4 T cells
caused Th2 cytokine gene expression in developing Th1 cells. Thus, Zheng
and Flavell (1997) concluded that GATA3 is necessary and sufficient for
Th2 cytokine gene expression.

Interleukin-5 (IL5; 147850) plays a central role in the growth and
differentiation of eosinophils and contributes to several disease
states, including asthma. There is evidence for a role for cyclic AMP as
an immunomodulator: agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels
inhibit production of cytokines predominantly produced by T-alpha-1
(Th1) cells such as IL2 (147680) and interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). In
contrast, the production of IL5, predominantly produced by Th2 cells, is
enhanced by these agents. Siegel et al. (1995) defined precisely the
cis-activating elements that regulate inducible murine Il5
transcription: sequences within the CLE0 element and also a region
located between -70 and -59 of the IL5 promoter that binds the
transcription factor Gata3. They speculated that activation via this
unique sequence combination confers the specificity needed for selective
expression of the IL5 gene in response to elevated levels of
intracellular cAMP.

Zhang et al. (1997) demonstrated that GATA3 is critical for expression
of the IL5 gene in Th2 cells. Whereas mutations in the GATA3 site
abolished antigen- or cAMP-stimulated IL5 promoter activation in Th2
cells, ectopic expression of GATA3 in Th1 cells or in a nonlymphoid,
non-IL5-producing cell line activated the IL5 promoter. Other findings
suggested that GATA3 gene expression may play an important role in the
balance between Th1 and Th2 subsets in immune responses. Zhang et al.
(1997) suggested that inhibition of GATA3 activity has therapeutic
potential in the treatment of asthma and other hypereosinophilic
diseases.

Zhang et al. (1998) showed that ectopic expression of GATA3 is
sufficient to drive IL5 but not IL4 gene (147780) expression. Also, in
Th2 cells, antisense GATA3 RNA inhibits IL5 but not IL4 promoter
activation. The induction of IL5 gene expression by GATA3 involves high
affinity binding of GATA3 to an inverted GATA repeat in the IL5
promoter.

Nakamura et al. (1999) found increased GATA3 gene expression in
association with cells showing an increase in IL5 mRNA in asthmatic
airways. They interpreted these findings as supporting a causal
association between augmented GATA3 expression and dysregulated IL5
expression in atopic asthma.

Tong et al. (2000) showed that murine Gata2 and Gata3 are specifically
expressed in white adipocyte precursors and that their downregulation
sets the stage for terminal differentiation. Constitutive Gata2 and
Gata3 expression suppressed adipocyte differentiation and trapped cells
at the preadipocyte stage. This effect was mediated, at least in part,
through the direct suppression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma (PPARG; 601487). Gata3-deficient embryonic stem cells
exhibit an enhanced capacity to differentiate into adipocytes, and
defective Gata2 and Gata3 expression is associated with obesity. Thus,
Tong et al. (2000) concluded that GATA2 and GATA3 regulate adipocyte
differentiation through molecular control of the preadipocyte-adipocyte
transition.

Fields et al. (2002) noted that high levels of histone acetylation at
particular loci correlate with transcriptional activity, whereas reduced
levels correlate with silencing. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP), PCR, and green fluorescent protein analysis, they demonstrated
that histones in the cytokine loci (IFNG and IL4) of naive T cells are
unacetylated, but upon TCR stimulation, the loci are rapidly and
progressively acetylated on histones H3 and H4. The acetylation at the
IL4 locus occurs early, regardless of Th1/Th2 polarizing conditions,
correlating with early transcription. The maintenance of acetylation
depends on cytokine and STAT4 (600558) and STAT6 (601512) signaling and
also on the transactivator activity of TBET (604895) and GATA3, the
putative 'master regulators' of Th lineage determination.

Hwang et al. (2005) reported that TBET represses Th2 lineage commitment
through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between itself and GATA3
that interferes with the binding of GATA3 to its target DNA. Hwang et
al. (2005) concluded that their results provide a novel function for
tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in specifying
alternate fates of a common progenitor cell. Hwang et al. (2005) showed
that TBET phosphorylation is restricted to the TEC kinases ITK (186973)
and RLK (600058). Coexpression studies demonstrated that this was most
efficiently performed by ITK. In primary CD4 T cells isolated from ITK-,
RLK-, or double ITK/RLK-deficient mice, the greatest diminution of TBET
tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in the absence of ITK. Furthermore,
mutation of TBET at tyrosine residue 525, but not control tyrosine
residue 437, resulted in greatly reduced phosphorylation by ITK,
revealing that ITK phosphorylates TBET at residue Y525 after T cell
receptor stimulation.

Chen et al. (2006) noted that activated T cells, particularly Th1 cells,
express sialyl Lewis x, but resting T cells do not. Using reporter
analysis, they showed that TBET promoted and GATA3 repressed
transcription of FUT7 (602030), the rate-limiting enzyme for sialyl
Lewis x synthesis. TBET interfered with GATA3 binding to its target DNA,
but GATA3 also interfered with TBET binding to the FUT7 promoter. GATA3
regulated FUT7 transcription by recruiting, in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner, histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3; 605166)
and HDAC5 (605315) and by competing with CBP (CREBBP; 600140)/p300
(EP300; 602700) in binding to the N terminus of TBET. Maximal expression
of FUT7 and sialyl Lewis x in T cells was obtained by ROG (ZBTB32;
605859)-mediated suppression of GATA3. Chen et al. (2006) concluded that
the GATA3/TBET transcription factor complex regulates cell
lineage-specific expression of lymphocyte homing receptors and that
glycoconjugates are regulated by this complex to attain cell
lineage-specific expression in Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte subsets.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Terminal deletions of chromosome 10p result in a DiGeorge (188400)-like
phenotype that includes hypoparathyroidism, heart defects, immune
deficiency, deafness, and renal malformations. One region that
contributes to this complex phenotype is that for the syndrome of
hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal insufficiency
(HDRS; 146255). Van Esch et al. (2000) performed deletion-mapping
studies in 2 HDRS patients and defined a critical 200-kb region that
contains the GATA3 gene. Search for GATA3 mutations in 3 other HDR
probands identified 1 nonsense mutation (131320.0005) and 2 intragenic
deletions (131320.0003, 131320.0004) that predicted a loss of function,
as confirmed by absence of DNA binding by the mutant GATA3 protein.
These results demonstrated that GATA3 is essential in the embryonic
development of the parathyroids, auditory system, and kidneys, and
showed that GATA3 haploinsufficiency causes human HDR syndrome.

Muroya et al. (2001) studied 9 Japanese families with HDR syndrome. FISH
and microsatellite analysis showed heterozygous deletions including
GATA3 in 4 families. Sequence analysis showed heterozygous novel
mutations in 3 families, including a missense mutation in exon 4
(131320.0006), an insertion mutation (131320.0007), and a nonsense
mutation in exon 6 (131320.0008).

In 10 patients with HDR syndrome from 7 unrelated families, Nesbit et
al. (2004) identified and characterized 7 mutations in exons 3 through 6
of the GATA3 gene. Using electrophoretic mobility shift, dissociation,
yeast 2-hybrid, and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, Nesbit
et al. (2004) demonstrated that mutations involving the C-terminal zinc
finger (ZnF2) or adjacent basic amino acids result in a loss of DNA
binding, but those of the N-terminal zinc finger (ZnF1) either lead to a
loss of interaction with specific zinc finger proteins of FOG2 (ZFPM2;
603693) or alter DNA-binding affinity.

Hernandez et al. (2007) reported a mother and daughter with HDR and
female genital tract malformations in whom they identified a deletion in
the GATA3 gene (131320.0009).

Chiu et al. (2006) sequenced the CASR (601199) and GATA3 genes in 5
unrelated Chinese families with familial hypoparathyroidism. They
identified 3 novel mutations in the GATA3 gene responsible for familial
hypoparathyroidism and deafness. Except for a previously described
polymorphism, they found no genetic variants in the CASR gene.

Ali et al. (2007) analyzed the GATA3 gene in 21 HDR probands and 14
patients with isolated hypoparathyroidism (see FIH, 146200); no
mutations were found in the FIH patients, but 13 different heterozygous
germline mutations were identified in the HDR probands, including 1
missense, 1 splice site, 3 nonsense, and 8 frameshift mutations. EMSA
analysis revealed 3 classes of GATA3 mutations: those involving of loss
of DNA binding due to loss of the C-terminal zinc finger, which
represent over 90% of mutations reported in GATA3; those resulting in
reduced DNA-binding affinity; and those that do not alter DNA binding or
affinity but likely alter the conformation change that occurs during
binding in the DNA major groove, as predicted by 3-dimensional modeling.

In a 14-year-old boy with neurologic symptoms in addition to the HDR
triad of hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal
dysplasia, who did not have any microdeletion in the 22q11.2 or 10p14
regions by FISH analysis, Ferraris et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous de novo 2-bp deletion (131320.0013) in exon2 of the GATA3
gene. The authors concluded that haploinsufficiency of GATA3 may be
responsible for a complex neurologic picture in addition to the known
triad of HDR syndrome.

In a 29-year-old Portuguese with severe hypoparathyroidism, bilateral
mild neurosensory deafness, and agenesis of the vagina and uterus but no
kidney abnormalities, Moldovan et al. (2011) analyzed the GATA3 gene and
identified a heterozygous missense mutation (C342Y; 131320.0014). The
authors noted that this patient, along with the mother and daughter with
HDR and female genital tract malformations studied by Hernandez et al.
(2007), seemed to confirm the role of GATA3 in regulating developmental
mechanisms of the uterus and vagina.

Lim et al. (2000) found that null mutations of Gata3 in mice led to a
reduced accumulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 191290) and dopamine
beta-hydroxylase (DPH; 223360) mRNA, whereas several other sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) genes were unaffected. They showed that Th and Dbh
deficiencies led to reduced noradrenalin in the SNS, and that
noradrenaline deficiency was the proximal cause of death in mutants by
feeding catechol intermediates to pregnant dams, thereby partially
averting Gata3 mutation-induced lethality. The older, pharmacologically
rescued mutants showed abnormalities that could not be detected in
untreated mutants. These late embryonic defects included renal
hypoplasia and developmental defects in structures derived from cephalic
neural crest cells. Thus, Lim et al. (2000) showed that Gata3 has a role
in the differentiation of multiple cell lineages during embryogenesis.

To elucidate GATA3 function, Pandolfi et al. (1995) disrupted the mouse
gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice
heterozygous for the Gata3 mutation were found to be fertile and
appeared in all respects to be normal, whereas homozygous mutant embryos
died between days 11 and 12 postcoitum and displayed massive internal
bleeding, marked growth retardation, severe deformities of the brain and
spinal cord, and gross aberrations in fetal liver hematopoiesis. The
functions of GATA1 and GATA2 (137295) had previously been studied by
comparable methods. The results in aggregate demonstrated that each
GATA-binding protein has a unique and essential function during the
development of the mouse embryo. In each case, targeted mutagenesis also
revealed surprising roles for each factor, underscoring the power of
this experimental approach: GATA1 is essential for erythroid cell
development, while disruption of GATA2 indicates a function during very
early events in the development of all blood cell lineages.

Using microarray analysis, Kaufman et al. (2003) identified Gata3 as an
induced transcription factor in embryonic day-13 to -18.5 mouse skin.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed Gata3 expression in
early vibrissae follicles and later in developing epidermis and in the
cone of presumptive inner root sheath (IRS) precursor cells within hair
follicles. Examination of pharmacologically rescued Gata3 -/- embryos
and grafted Gata3 -/- skin showed aberrations in hair follicle
morphogenesis that included not only structural defects in the IRS and
hair shaft, but also molecular defects in cell lineage determination.
Kaufman et al. (2003) concluded that, along with LEF1 (153245) and WNTs
(see 164820), GATA3 is at the crossroads of both lymphocyte
differentiation and of the IRS versus hair shaft cell fate decision in
hair follicle morphogenesis.

Pai et al. (2003) generated mice conditionally lacking Gata3 at early
(double-negative) and late (double-positive) stages of thymic
differentiation. They found that Gata3 was indispensable for thymocytes
to pass through beta selection, the process by which T-cell
receptor-beta is paired with pre-T-cell receptor-alpha, a requirement
for double-negative stage-3 cell survival. Furthermore, Gata3 was
required for single-positive Cd4 thymocyte development. Pai et al.
(2003) concluded that continued expression of GATA3 is required at
multiple stages of thymocyte differentiation.

Zhu et al. (2004) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Gata3
and Gata3-deficient mouse T-cell lines and found that both Il4-dependent
and -independent Th2 differentiation was diminished, permitting Th1
differentiation in the absence of Ifng and Il12 (see 161561). Deletion
of Gata3 from established Th2 cells abolished production of Il5 and Il13
(147683), but not of Il4. Mice lacking Gata3 produced Ifng rather than
Th2 cytokines in response to infection with Nippostrongylus
brasiliensis. Zhu et al. (2004) concluded that Gata3 serves as a
principal switch in determining Th1-Th2 responses.

Van der Wees et al. (2004) analyzed auditory brainstem response
thresholds in heterozygous Gata3-knockout mice from 1 to 19 months of
age and demonstrated a hearing loss of 30 dB compared to wildtype
littermates. No physiologic or morphologic abnormalities were found in
the brainstem, cerebral cortex, or the outer or middle ear. However, the
cochleae of Gata3 +/- mice showed significant progressive morphologic
degeneration starting with the outer hair cells at the apex and
ultimately involving all hair cells and supporting cells in the entire
cochlea. Van der Wees et al. (2004) concluded that hearing loss
following GATA3 haploinsufficiency is peripheral in nature and that this
defect is detectable from early postnatal development and continues
through adulthood.

Kouros-Mehr et al. (2006) found that Gata3 was the most highly enriched
transcription factor in mammary epithelium of pubertal mice. Conditional
deletion of Gata3 led to severe defects in mammary development due to
failure in terminal end bud formation during puberty. After acute Gata3
loss, adult mice exhibited undifferentiated luminal cell expansion with
basement-membrane detachment, which led to caspase (see CASP1;
147678)-mediated cell death.

In a mother and her son with HDR syndrome (146255), Van Esch et al.
(2000) identified a nonsense mutation at nucleotide 828 of the GATA3
gene, a C-to-T transition resulting in an arginine-to-ter substitution
at residue 277 (R277X). This mutation was predicted to result in a

In a Japanese family with HDR syndrome (146255), Muroya et al. (2001)
identified a 2-bp insertion at nucleotide 900 and a 3-bp insertion at
nucleotide 901 in exon 4 of the GATA3 gene (900insAA plus 901insCCT, or
C901AACCCT), resulting in premature termination at codon 357 with loss
of the second zinc finger domain.

GATA3, ARG367TER

In a 33-year-old Japanese man who had hypoparathyroidism, wore hearing
aids, and had proteinuria and hematuria (HDR syndrome; 146255), Muroya
et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for a 1099C-T transition in exon
6 of the GATA3 gene, resulting in an arg367-to-ter (R367X) substitution.
The mutation was also detected in his 3-year-old daughter, who did not
have hypoparathyroidism or renal dysplasia, but was clinically suspected
of hearing loss due to speech delay.

In an 18-year-old Han Chinese boy and his 5-year-old sister, who both
had hypoparathyroidism and bilateral sensorineural deafness but no renal
dysplasia, Sun et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for the R367X
mutation in the GATA3 gene. The mutation was not found in either of
their unaffected parents; Sun et al. (2009) concluded that 1 of the
parents likely had germinal mosaicism of the mutant GATA3 gene.

GATA3, 1-BP DEL, 431G

In a mother and daughter with HDR syndrome (146255), Hernandez et al.
(2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (431delG) in exon 3
of the GATA3 gene, causing a frameshift at codon 144 and resulting in a
termination signal at codon 194. The mother had a nonfunctional right
kidney and a septate uterus, whereas her daughter had right renal

3 of the GATA3 gene (478delG), predicted to result in frameshift from
codon 160 and premature termination at codon 194. The mutation was
hypothesized to disrupt dual zinc fingers as well as 1 transactivating
domain.

et al. (2006) detected a donor splice site mutation at the GATA3 exon
4/intron 4 boundary (IVS4+2T-GCTTACTTCCC) that was predicted to lead to
truncated GATA3 proteins lacking both N- and C-terminal zinc-containing
fingers.

GATA3, ARG353SER

In affected members of a Chinese family with HDR syndrome (146255), Chiu
et al. (2006) detected an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 1059 in exon
6 of the GATA3 gene that resulted in an arg353-to-ser (R353S)
substitution. The mutation was predicted to disrupt the helical turn and
thus changed the angle between the C-terminal zinc finger and the
adjacent C-terminal tail.

HYPOPARATHYROIDISM, SENSORINEURAL DEAFNESS, AND RENAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
GATA3, 2-BP DEL, 108GG

In a 14-year-old boy with neurologic symptoms in addition to
hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal dysplasia (HDRS;
146255), Ferraris et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a de novo
2-bp deletion (108delGG) in exon 2 of the GATA3 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and a premature stop codon after a new 15-amino acid
sequence. The unaffected parents did not carry the mutation, which was
also not found in 100 controls. Neurologic involvement included basal
ganglia calcifications, palpebral ptosis, postural strabismus,
horizontal nystagmus, and pseudopapilledema.

HYPOPARATHYROIDISM, SENSORINEURAL DEAFNESS, AND RENAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
GATA3, CYS342TYR

In a 29-year-old Portuguese woman with severe hypoparathyroidism,
bilateral mild neurosensory deafness, and agenesis of the vagina and
uterus but no kidney abnormalities (see 146255), Moldovan et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for a 1025G-A transition in exon 5 of the
GATA3 gene, resulting in a cys342-to-tyr (C342Y) substitution at a
highly conserved residue within the functionally important zinc finger-2
domain. The parents were unavailable for study, but there was no family
history of the disease.

601045	TITLE *601045 CATENIN, DELTA-1; CTNND1
;;CATENIN, DELTA; CTNND;;
CADHERIN-ASSOCIATED SRC SUBSTRATE; CAS;;
p120(CTN)
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Catenins were discovered as proteins that are linked ('catena' means
'chain' in Latin) to the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane cadherin
(see 601120) proteins. Delta-catenin, also called CAS, p120(cas), or
p120(ctn), is a tyrosine kinase substrate implicated in ligand-induced
receptor signaling through the EGF receptor (131550), the PDGF receptor
(PDGFR; see 173490), and the CSF1 receptor (164770), as well as in cell
transformation by SRC (190090). Delta-catenin is a major component of
multiprotein cell-cell adhesion complexes containing E-cadherin
(192090), alpha-catenin (116805), beta-catenin (116806), and
gamma-catenin, also known as plakoglobin (173325) (summary by
Keirsebilck et al., 1998).

CLONING

Reynolds et al. (1992) isolated a mouse p120(ctn) cDNA. Like
beta-catenin and plakoglobin, the predicted protein contains copies of a
repeat originally identified in the Drosophila 'Armadillo' protein.

Keirsebilck et al. (1998) identified human p120(ctn) isoforms, which
they designated 1 to 4, that arise by alternative use of start codons
and additional isoforms that differ due to alternative splicing of 3
exons, which they named A, B, and C. The longest isoform was of type
1ABC and contained 968 amino acids. Isoform 1A contains 933 amino acids
and is 97% identical to mouse p120(ctn). Human p120(ctn) contains up to
10 Armadillo repeats. Keirsebilck et al. (1998) used RT-PCR to
demonstrate tissue-specific and cell line-specific expression of various
isoforms.

Independently, Nagase et al. (1997) identified KIAA0384, a human
p120(ctn) cDNA that encodes isoform 1AC, in a screen for brain cDNAs
encoding proteins larger than 100 kD. RT-PCR detected expression in all
tissues examined except skeletal muscle. Highest expression was detected
in placenta, lung, liver, and kidney, followed by ovary and small
intestine.

GENE FUNCTION

Dillon et al. (1998) reported that a complete loss of p120(ctn)
expression was observed in approximately 10% of invasive ductal breast
carcinomas investigated.

Wildenberg et al. (2006) found that depletion of p120-catenin in NIH3T3
mouse fibroblasts by small interfering RNA caused constitutive
activation of Rho (RHOA; 165390), cell transformation, loss of contact
inhibition, and growth in the absence of serum. Moreover, Pdgfr and
integrin (see 135630) signaling pathways involved in remodeling the
actin cytoskeleton were selectively impaired. Wildenberg et al. (2006)
traced these effects to obligatory roles of p120-catenin and Arhgap5
(602680) in a pathway that connects Rac (RAC1; 602048) activation to Rho
inhibition. They concluded that p120-catenin and ARHGAP5 use Rho GTPases
to mediate crosstalk between a wide variety of receptors to coordinate
cadherin function with other activities that direct cell adhesion,
motility, and proliferation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Keirsebilck et al. (1998) determined that the human p120(ctn) gene
contains 21 exons, potentially encoding up to 32 protein isoforms as
products of alternative splicing.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Reynolds et al. (1996) determined
that the human gene, symbolized CTNND, is localized immediately adjacent
to the centromere in band 11q11. By interspecific backcross analysis,
they assigned the murine gene, symbolized Catns, to the middle of mouse
chromosome 2. By analysis of radiation hybrids, Nagase et al. (1997)
confirmed that the p120 gene maps to human chromosome 11. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization and analysis of a somatic cell hybrid
mapping panel, Bonne et al. (1998) mapped the CTNND1 gene to chromosome
11q11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using conditional targeting of p120(ctn) in mouse epidermis,
Perez-Moreno et al. (2006) found that p120-null neonatal epidermis
exhibited reduced intercellular adherens junction components, but no
overt disruption in barrier function or intercellular adhesion. As the
mice aged, they displayed epidermal hypoplasia and chronic inflammation,
typified by hair degeneration and loss of body fat. Use of skin
engraftments and antiinflammatory drugs showed that these features were
not due to reductions in junctional cadherins and catenins, but rather
to NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activation. Both in vivo and in vitro,
p120-null epidermal cells activated NF-kappa-B, triggering a cascade of
proinflammatory NF-kappa-B targets. NF-kappa-B activation in p120-null
keratinocytes was accompanied by alterations in Rho GTPase activity that
appeared to reside upstream from NF-kappa-B activation and downstream
from p120 loss.

;;SNM1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SNM1;;
SNM1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, A; SNM1A;;
KIAA0086
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNA interstrand cross-links prevent strand separation, thereby
physically blocking transcription, replication, and segregation of DNA.
DCLRE1A is one of several evolutionarily conserved genes involved in
repair of interstrand cross-links (Dronkert et al., 2000).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human immature
myeloid cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1995) cloned DCLRE1A,
which they called KIAA0086. The deduced 1,040-amino acid protein shares
33.3% identity over 192 amino acids with the S. cerevisiae DNA repair
protein Snm1. Northern blot analysis detected expression in all tissues
and cell lines examined except peripheral blood leukocytes.

Dronkert et al. (2000) determined that human DCLRE1A, which they called
SNM1, contains a nuclear localization signal and a zinc finger motif in
its N-terminal half and 8 motifs shared with SNM1-like proteins of
various species in its C-terminal half. Fluorescence-tagged SNM1
localized to nuclei of transfected human fibroblasts and Chinese hamster
ovary cells, but it was excluded from nucleoli.

Using Northern blot analysis, Richie et al. (2002) detected a 4.5-kb
SNM1 transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in
pancreas and brain. Fluorescence-tagged SNM1 localized to the nucleus of
individual transfected HeLa and human breast carcinoma cells in 3
distinct patterns: diffuse nuclear staining, multiple nuclear foci, or 1
or 2 larger nuclear bodies.

GENE FUNCTION

Dronkert et al. (2000) found that cells overexpressing human SNM1
underwent morphologic changes consistent with apoptosis a few days after
SNM1 introduction.

Richie et al. (2002) found that exposure of cells to ionizing radiation
or to an interstrand cross-linking agent altered the pattern of SNM1
nuclear localization. Under these conditions, the number of cells
exhibiting SNM1 bodies decreased and the population of cells with SNM1
foci increased. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that SNM1
colocalized with 53BP1 (TP53BP1; 605230) before and after exposure to
ionizing radiation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the
interaction. SNM1 foci formed after ionizing radiation were largely
coincident with foci formed by MRE11 (MRE11A; 600814) and to a lesser
extent with those formed by BRCA1 (113705), but not with those formed by
RAD51 (179617). Focus formation by SNM1 did not require ATM (607585).

GENE STRUCTURE

Demuth and Digweed (1998) determined that the DCLRE1A gene contains 9
exons and spans about 20 kb. The upstream region contains a GC box, but
no TATA box, and has 1 SP1 (189906) site, 3 AP1 (see JUN; 165160) sites,
4 AP4 (TFAP4; 600743) sites, and 1 NFKB (see 164011) site.

MAPPING

By examining a panel of human-rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al.
(1995) mapped the DCLRE1A gene to chromosome 10.

ANIMAL MODEL

Dronkert et al. (2000) found that Snm1 -/- mice were viable and fertile
and showed no major abnormalities, but they were hypersensitive to
mitomycin C compared with wildtype mice. Snm1 -/- mouse embryonic stem
cells grew at a rate comparable to wildtype stem cells, but they were
2-fold more sensitive to mitomycin C. Mutant and wildtype stem cells
showed the same sensitivity to other DNA interstrand cross-linking
agents, ultraviolet irradiation, and gamma irradiation.

600423	TITLE *600423 ENDOTHELIN-CONVERTING ENZYME 1; ECE1
;;ECE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 is involved in the proteolytic processing
of endothelin-1 (EDN1; 131240), -2 (EDN2; 131241), and -3 (EDN3; 131242)
to biologically active peptides.

CLONING

Schmidt et al. (1994) purified a membrane-bound protease activity from
bovine endothelial cells that specifically converts the inactive form to
EDN1. The enzyme was cleaved with trypsin and peptide sequencing
analysis confirmed it to be a zinc-chelating metalloprotease containing
the typical HEXXH (HELTH) motif. RT-PCR and cDNA screens were used to
isolate the complete cDNAs of the bovine and human enzymes.

A splice variant of the same cDNA was identified by Shimada et al.
(1995) from an umbilical vein endothelial cell library. The authors
expressed the protein in COS-1 cells and could detect it in membrane
fractions from expressing cells. Yorimitsu et al. (1995) also obtained a
human ECE cDNA by screening an ACHN human renal adenocarcinoma library.
That cDNA, referred to as AECE, encoded a predicted 770-codon open
reading frame which is was different at the amino end from the Shimada
et al. (1995) sequence but close to the Schmidt et al. (1994) sequence.
The rat ECE and human AECE amino acid sequences were over 96% alike.

GENE STRUCTURE

The ECE1 gene consists of 20 exons and spans over 120 kb (Valdenaire et
al., 1999; Funke-Kaiser et al., 2000).

Valdenaire et al. (1995) found that the precursors of the ECE1 a and b
isoform mRNAs are transcribed from 2 distinct start sites, upstream from
exon 1 and exon 3, respectively. Sequence analysis of the 2 putative
promoters revealed the presence of motifs characteristic for several
transcription factors. The authors stated that comparison of the ECE
gene structure with those of other zinc metalloproteinases, as well as a
phylogenetic study, confirmed the existence of a metalloprotease
subfamily composed of ECE1, ECE2 (610145), neutral endopeptidase
(120520), Kell blood group protein (613883), and 2 bacterial enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

Maggi et al. (2000) demonstrated that in FNC-B4 cells, which are derived
from a human fetal olfactory epithelium, both sex steroids and odorants
regulate GnRH secretion. They found biologic activity of EDN1 in this
GnRH-secreting neuronal cell. In situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry revealed gene and protein expression of EDN1 and
ECE1 in both fetal olfactory mucosa and FNC-B4 cells. Experiments with
radiolabeled EDN1 and EDN3 strongly indicated the presence of 2 classes
of binding sites, corresponding to the ETA (16,500 sites/cell) and the
ETB receptors (8,700 sites/cell). Functional studies using selective
analogs indicated that these 2 classes of receptors subserve distinct
functions in human GnRH-secreting cells. The ETA receptor subtype
mediated an increase in intracellular calcium and GnRH secretion.

MAPPING

Valdenaire et al. (1995) mapped the ECE1 gene to chromosome 1p36 by
isotopic in situ hybridization.

By Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA from human/mouse somatic
cell hybrids, Matsuoka et al. (1996) demonstrated that ECE1 maps to
chromosome 1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), they refined
the localization to 1p36.1. By FISH, Albertin et al. (1996) mapped ECE1
to 1p36 and confirmed the localization to chromosome 1 by analysis of
monochromosomal hybrids. Radiation hybrid mapping localized the gene
tentatively at the border between 1p36.3 and 1p36.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Hirschsprung Disease, Cardiac Defects, and Autonomic Dysfunction

Hofstra et al. (1999) described involvement of the ECE1 gene in a
patient with skip-lesions Hirschsprung disease, cardiac defects, and
autonomic dysfunction (613870). By screening all 19 exons of the gene,
using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by sequencing,
they identified a heterozygous C-to-T transition, resulting in the
substitution of cysteine for arginine at position 742 (R742C;
600423.0001).

- Essential Hypertension

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) proposed that ECE1 is a candidate gene for
human blood pressure regulation and identified 5 polymorphisms in ECE1
among a cohort of 704 European hypertensive patients. Transient
transfection of the reporter constructs containing the -338A allele
(600423.0002) showed an increase in promoter activity compared with the
wildtype promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the
specific binding of E2F2 (600426), a transcription factor, to both ECE1b
promoter sequences, with the -338A allele being associated with an
increased affinity to E2F2 compared with -338C. In 100 untreated
hypertensive women, both the -338A and -839G (600423.0003) alleles were
significantly associated with ambulatory blood pressure values. The
authors proposed a link between the cell cycle-associated E2F family and
blood pressure regulation via a component of the endothelin system.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yanagisawa et al. (1998) and Clouthier et al. (1998) showed that mice
deficient in either endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA; 131243) or ECE1
develop defects in a subset of cephalic and cardiac neural crest
derivatives. Ednra-null mice show defects in craniofacial structures,
great vessels, and cardiac outflow tract. Ece1-null mice exhibit a
virtually identical phenotype to Ednra-deficient and
endothelin-1-deficient embryos due to the absence of biologically active
endothelin-1. Ece1-deficient mice lack enteric neurons and
epidermal/choroidal melanocytes, reproducing the phenotype of Edn3
(131242) and Ednra knockout mice. Yanagisawa et al. (1998) elaborated on
the role of the Edn1/Ednra pathway in the patterning of the aortic arch
in mice.

Eckman et al. (2003) found that Ece1 +/- mice had significantly elevated
concentrations of both beta-amyloid-40 and beta-amyloid-42 (see APP;
104760) in their brains compared with littermate controls.

Choi et al. (2006) found that doubly transgenic mice expressing an
Alzheimer disease (104300)-associated APP mutation and overexpressing
PRKCE (176975) had decreased amyloid plaques, plaque-associated neuritic
dystrophy, and reactive astrocytosis compared to mice only expressing
the APP mutation. There was no evidence for altered APP cleavage in the
doubly transgenic mice; instead, overexpression of PRKCE increased the
activity of Ece1, which degrades beta-amyloid.

Ortmann et al. (2005) found that expression of Ece1 and Ece2 was
increased in nonobese diabetic mice compared with controls.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE, CARDIAC DEFECTS, AND AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION
ECE1, ARG742CYS

Hofstra et al. (1999) identified an arg742-to-cys mutation in the ECE1
gene in a patient with skip-lesions Hirschsprung disease, cardiac
defects, craniofacial abnormalities and other dysmorphic features, and
autonomic dysfunction (613870). The patient's parents were not available
for testing. Amino acid position 742 is in the vicinity of the active
site of ECE1 (Valdenaire et al., 1995). Hofstra et al. (1999) suggested
that the R742C mutation was responsible for, or at least contributed to,
the phenotype of the patient in view of the function of ECE1 during
murine development suggested by mouse models, the overlap in phenotypic
features of these mouse models and those of the patient, and the
functional consequences of the mutation on enzyme activity. The mutation
was thought to lead to the phenotype by resulting in reduced levels of
EDN1 and EDN3.

.0002
HYPERTENSION, ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ECE1, -338C-A

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) identified a polymorphism in the 5-prime
flanking region of the ECE1 gene, -338C-A, that was associated with
ambulatory blood pressure values (see 145500). The polymorphism is
located within a putative consensus site for E2F (see 189971) and GATA
(see 601656) proteins. The -338A allele was associated with higher
daytime and nighttime 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure in
nontreated hypertensive women. Transient transfection of the reporter
constructs containing the -338A allele showed an increase in promoter
activity compared with the wildtype promoter. Electrophoretic mobility
shift assays revealed the specific binding of E2F2 (600426), a
transcription factor, to both ECE1b promoter sequences, with the -338A
allele being associated with an increased affinity to E2F2 compared with
-338C.

.0003
HYPERTENSION, ESSENTIAL, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ECE1, -839T-G

Funke-Kaiser et al. (2003) identified a polymorphism in the 5-prime
flanking region of the ECE1 gene, -839T-G, that was associated with
ambulatory blood pressure values (see 145500).

;;CHAPERONIN CONTAINING TCP1, SUBUNIT 3;;
CCT-GAMMA; CCTG;;
TCP1 RING COMPLEX, POLYPEPTIDE 5; TRIC5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Molecular chaperones are proteins capable of folding or assembling
nascent proteins in a higher order structure. A molecular chaperone
called TCP1 ring complex (TRiC) plays a role in actin and tubulin
folding. TRiC is composed of 2 heteromeric subunits of 6 to 9 different
proteins. The cytoplasmic T-complex protein-1 (TCP1; 186980), an
abundant testicular germ cell protein, has been found in this complex.
Other components of TRiC, such as TRIC5, are TCP1-related proteins
(Sevigny et al., 1994).

CLONING

Joly et al. (1994) cloned a mouse cDNA corresponding to tryptic
fragments of the bovine TRiCP5 subunit described by Frydman et al.
(1992). The mouse TRiCP5 shares 48% nucleotide and 34% amino acid
homology with mouse Tcp1. It is a cytosolic protein also found in the
nuclear matrix of several cultured human cell lines. Furthermore, like
TCP1, it is highly expressed in testis.

Sevigny et al. (1994) cloned a partial human cDNA clone homologous to
mouse TRiCP5.

Walkley et al. (1996) cloned the human cDNA from a kidney library. The
1.9-kb cDNA encodes a predicted 544-amino acid protein that is 98%
similar to the mouse sequence and 75% similar to the yeast gene. The
mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues and at high levels in
mouse testis.

Sevigny et al. (1996) cloned the gene coding for the mouse P5 subunit.

GENE FUNCTION

Feldman et al. (1999) demonstrated that the folding and assembly of the
VHL protein (608537) into a complex with its partner proteins, elongin B
(600787) and elongin C (600788), is directly mediated by the chaperonin
TRiC. Their results defined a novel role for TRiC in mediating
oligomerization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sevigny et al. (1996) determined that the mouse Tric5 gene contains 14
exons distributed within 25 kb of genomic DNA. Sevigny et al. (1996)
used primer extension to demonstrate multiple transcription start points
for the Tric5 gene. This was considered consistent with the lack of any
obvious TATA box upstream of the transcription start points.

MAPPING

Sevigny et al. (1994) mapped the TRIC5 gene to chromosome 1q23 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. The fact that the human TRIC5 gene
is not on chromosome 6 like other TCP1-related proteins implied to
Sevigny et al. (1994) that the genes coding the TCP1-related proteins
present in the TCP1 ring complex are probably not organized in a cluster
and thus are not synchronously regulated by a cis-acting control region
such as the LCR involved in the regulation of globin synthesis.

Sevigny et al. (1996) showed that the mouse genome contains 1 Tric5 gene
and 1 Tric5 pseudogene located on chromosomes 3F and 5B, respectively.

615364	TITLE *615364 ADENYLATE KINASE 7; AK7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Adenylate kinases (AKs; EC 2.7.4.3), such as AK7, are
phosphotransferases that catalyze the interconversion of nucleoside
phosphates. AKs maintain high levels of ATP in a combined action with
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, are required for DNA and RNA
synthesis, and may contribute to the activity of medicinal nucleoside
and nucleotide analogs (summary by Panayiotou et al., 2011).

CLONING

Panayiotou et al. (2011) cloned and characterized human AK7. The deduced
723-amino acid protein has an N-terminal domain of 368 amino acids that
is not found in other AKs, followed by a classic AK domain and a
C-terminal DPY30 (612032) motif. Fluorescence-tagged AK7 localized to
the cytosol of transfected HeLa cells.

Fernandez-Gonzalez et al. (2009) identified 3 splice variants of mouse
Ak7. The full-length, 723-amino acid Ak7 protein, which they called
Ak7a, has a WcaG motif near the N terminus, followed by an AK domain and
a C-terminal DPY30 motif. The WcaG motif is a signature of some
prokaryotic nucleoside diphosphate sugar epimerases, and the DPY30 motif
is a protein oligomerization motif. Compared with Ak7a, the Ak7b isoform
contains a C-terminal truncation and lacks the DPY30 motif, and Ak7c is
further truncated and lacks both the AK domain and DPY30 motif. RT-PCR
analysis of mouse tissues detected highest Ak7 expression in testis,
followed by trachea and oviduct. Lower expression was detected in brain
and lung, and no expression was detected in heart, kidney, liver, and
spleen. In situ hybridization revealed that Ak7 expression in brain was
restricted to ependymal cells lining the third ventricle and to choroid
plexus. In lung, Ak7 was expressed in the descending airways. In testis,
abundant Ak7 expression was found in seminiferous tubules, where it
colocalized with differentiating cells and mature spermatids. AK7 was
also expressed in respiratory epithelium of trachea. Fernandez-Gonzalez
et al. (2009) noted that Ak7 was expressed in tissues rich in epithelial
ciliated cells with (9+2) axonemes. Database analysis revealed
conservation of Ak7 only among organisms possessing motile (9+2) cilia.

GENE FUNCTION

In human nasal epithelial cell culture, Milara et al. (2010) found that
AK7 expression was upregulated during ciliogenesis and was widely
expressed in differentiated nasal epithelial cells with predominant
expression on the apical surface, suggesting that it localizes to
ciliated cells. Knockdown of AK7 using siRNA caused a decrease in
ciliary beat frequency. Nasal biopsy from patients with primary ciliary
dyskinesia showed lower AK7 mRNA and protein expression compared to
healthy control samples. The findings suggested that AK7 is involved in
ciliary beat, and Milara et al. (2010) hypothesized that downregulation
of energy transport due to decreased expression of AK7 may contribute to
the development of ciliary dyskinesia.

Panayiotou et al. (2011) found that in vitro-translated AK7 and AK8
(615365) showed highest affinity for AMP as substrate with ATP as the
phosphate donor. Both also recognized dAMP, CMP, and dCMP as substrates.
Both showed a higher affinity for AMP than the major cytosolic adenylate
kinase, AK1 (103000), but they had a much lower maximal catalytic rate
than AK1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Panayiotou et al. (2011) determined that the AK7 gene contains 18 exons
and spans 96.7 kb.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the AK7 gene to chromosome 14q32.2 based on an
alignment of the AK7 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK057426) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using transgene insertional mutagenesis, Fernandez-Gonzalez et al.
(2009) developed a line of mice that had insertion of the transgene in
intron 5 of the Ak7 gene. No Ak7 expression was detected in homozygous
transgenic (Ak7 -/-) mice. Ak7 -/- mice showed signs of primary ciliary
dyskinesia (see 244400), and about half showed severe hydrocephalus soon
after birth and died within the first month. About 25% exhibited milder
ventricular expansion and survived more than 6 weeks. At 42 days, male
Ak7 -/- mice lacked mature spermatids and spermatozoa, and electron
microscopy showed abnormal sperm heads and absence of tail structures.
At sexual maturity, male, but not female, Ak7 -/- mice were infertile.
Ak7 -/- animals also showed mucus accumulation in paranasal passages and
developed dramatic respiratory pathology upon allergen challenge.
Electron microscopic analysis of bronchial epithelial cells revealed
reduced number of motile cilia, and cilia showed axonemes with missing
central microtubule doublets and abnormal peripheral microtubules.
Morphologic defects in Ak7 -/- cilia were accompanied by significantly
reduced ciliary beat frequency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
AK7, 1-BP INS, 1214T

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to primary ciliary dyskinesia (CILD; see 244400) has
not been confirmed.

In 3 of 31 unrelated patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia, Mata et
al. (2012) identified a heterozygous 1-bp insertion (c.1214insT) in the
AK7 gene, predicted to result in a frameshift and premature termination
in the active catalytic center of the protein. The mutation was not
found in 40 control individuals. Analysis of family members of 1 of the
patients showed that his unaffected mother, father, and brother all
carried the wildtype AK7 genotype. Family members of the other 2
patients were not studied, so segregation of the mutation with the
disorder could not be determined. None of the patients had a family
history of respiratory disease. RT-PCR with primers directed against the
last 2 exons of the AK7 gene showed virtual absence of mutant AK7 mRNA
in patients with the truncating mutation. Protein quantification was not
possible due to insufficient material. Two of the patients had situs
inversus, consistent with a diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome. Analysis
of cilia showed absence of dynein in 1 patient, uncoordinated motion
pattern in 2, and motionless cilia in the third. Nasal airway epithelial
cells from 1 of the patients showed cilia, but there was a decrease in
cilia density and a decrease in beat frequency compared to controls.
Mata et al. (2012) suggested that mutation in the AK7 gene may be
associated with CILD, but also noted that the patients may have more
than 1 alteration in genes involved in the development of the disorder;
other genes were not studied in these patients. The AK7 gene was chosen
for study because homozygous Ak7-null mice develop CILD
(Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009) and patients with CILD have been shown
to have decreased expression of AK7 (Milara et al., 2010).

610038	TITLE *610038 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 37, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, C; VPS37C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

VPS37C is a subunit of ESCRT-I (endosomal sorting complex required for
transport I), a complex in the class E vacuolar protein sorting (VPS)
pathway required for sorting ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins into
internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (Eastman et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching a database for sequences homologous to yeast Vps37,
Stuchell et al. (2004) identified human VPS37C. The deduced 523-amino
acid protein contains a central mod(r) (modifier of rudimentary) domain
and 2 coiled-coil regions, one overlapping the N-terminal border of the
mod(r) domain and the other within the mod(r) domain.

Using TSG101 (601387) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a peripheral
mononuclear lymphocyte cDNA library, Eastman et al. (2005) cloned
VPS37C. The deduced 355-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal mod(r)
domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Eastman et al. (2005) found that VPS37C formed a ternary complex with
TSG101 and VPS28 (601387) by binding a C-terminal domain of TSG101.
VPS37C also bound HRS (HGS; 604375), another class E VPS factor. VPS37C
was recruited to aberrant endosomes induced by overexpression of TSG101,
HRS, or a dominant-negative form of VPS4 (VPS4A; 609982). Enveloped
viruses that encode PTAP motifs to facilitate budding, like human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Gag protein, exploit ESCRT-I as an
interface with the class E VPS pathway. VPS37C was recruited to the
plasma membrane along with TSG101 by HIV-1 Gag. Moreover, direct fusion
of VPS37C to HIV-1 Gag obviated the requirement for a PTAP motif to
induce virion release. Depletion of VPS37C from human embryonic kidney
cells did not inhibit murine leukemia virus budding, which is not
mediated by ESCRT-I. However, if murine leukemia virus budding was
engineered to be ESCRT-I-dependent, it was inhibited by VPS37C
depletion, and the inhibition was accentuated if VPS37B (610037) was
simultaneously depleted. Eastman et al. (2005) concluded that VPS37C is
a functional component of mammalian ESCRT-I.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the VPS37C
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP SHGC-31731).

606440	TITLE *606440 STEREOCILIN; STRC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The STRC gene, which encodes stereocilin, is expressed in the sensory
hair cells and is associated with the stereocilia, the stiff microvilli
forming the structure for mechanoreception of sound stimulation.
Mutation in the STRC gene results in nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness
(DFNB16; 603720).

CLONING

To identify genes mutated in hereditary deafness, Verpy et al. (2001)
developed a candidate gene approach based on the identification of genes
specifically or preferentially expressed in the inner ear. They
identified a mouse clone derived from a vestibular library that was
homologous to several human genomic clones derived from the 15q15
chromosomal region, within the locus for DFNB16. The human STRC protein
is made up of 1,809 amino acids and contains a putative signal peptide
and several hydrophobic segments. Using immunohistolabeling, Verpy et
al. (2001) demonstrated that, in the mouse inner ear, stereocilin is
expressed only in the sensory hair cells and is associated with the
stereocilia, the stiff microvilli forming the structure for
mechanoreception of sound stimulation.

GENE STRUCTURE

The STRC gene contains 29 exons, encompassing approximately 19 kb, and
is tandemly duplicated, with the coding sequence of the second copy
interrupted by a stop codon in exon 20 (Verpy et al., 2001). The 2
copies are in a telomere-to-centromere orientation, less than 100 kb
apart.

MAPPING

Verpy et al. (2001) identified the STRC gene on chromosome 15q15, within
the candidate region for DFNB16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 families with autosomal recessive nonsyndromal sensorineural
deafness, mapped to the DFNB16 locus, Verpy et al. (2001) identified 2
frameshift mutations and a large deletion in the copy of the STRC gene
containing 29 coding exons.

Dgany et al. (2002) reported a French family in which a 56-year-old male
and his 2 brothers suffered from type I congenital dyserythropoietic
anemia (CDA) (224120), asthenoteratozoospermia, and nonsyndromic
deafness. They identified homozygosity for a point mutation within the
codanin gene (N598S; 607465.0003) as the cause of the type I CDA. Avidan
et al. (2003) found that the 3 sibs were also homozygous for an
approximately 70-kb deletion in chromosome 15q15, which removed the
entire stereocilin gene and truncated the CATSPER2 gene (607249). Avidan
et al. (2003) suggested that lack of functional stereocilin, which is
mutated in nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness, and CATSPER2, a
voltage-gated cation channel expressed exclusively in spermatozoa, may
explain the observed deafness and male infertility phenotypes,
respectively.

In 3 consanguineous Iranian families segregating nonsyndromic deafness
and male infertility (611102), Zhang et al. (2007) identified an
approximately 100-kb deleted region on chromosome 15q15.3 involving
KIAA0377 (610979), CKMT1B (123290), STRC, and CATSPER2. The families did
not have identical deletions and haplotype analysis indicated that the
families did not share a common ancestor; the authors noted that a large
tandem repeat on chromosome 15q15.3 makes it prone to rearrangement.
Zhang et al. (2007) stated that the hearing loss phenotype in these
families was similar by audioprofiling to that of DFNB16, suggesting
that deletion of STRC is causally related to their deafness.

ANIMAL MODEL

Verpy et al. (2008) detected stereocilin in association with horizontal
top connectors, lateral links that join adjacent stereocilia within the
outer hair cell's hair bundle. The authors found that these links were
absent in stereocilin-null mutant mice, which became progressively deaf.
At the onset of hearing, however, their cochlear sensitivity and
frequency tuning were almost normal, although masking was much reduced
and both acoustic and electrical waveform distortions were completely
lacking. From this unique functional situation, Verpy et al. (2008)
concluded that the main source of cochlear waveform distortions is a
deflection-dependent hair bundle stiffness resulting from constraints
imposed by the horizontal top connectors, and not from the intrinsic
nonlinear behavior of the mechanoelectrical transducer channel.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 16
STRC, 1-BP INS, 3157C

In a consanguineous family with autosomal recessive nonsyndromal
sensorineural deafness mapping to the DFNB16 locus (603720), Verpy et
al. (2001) identified an insertion of a cytosine in exon 13 at position
3157 of the STRC cDNA. This insertion, 3157insC, was expected to result
in the translocation of 19 out-of-frame amino acids and a downstream
premature termination codon at position 3214 in exon 13. The mutation
was present in homozygous form in the affected individuals.

.0002
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 16
STRC, 4-BP DEL, NT2171

In affected members of a family with autosomal recessive deafness
(603720), Verpy et al. (2001) found a 4-bp deletion in exon 5 of the
STRC gene. This mutation, 2171-2174delTTTG, also detected in the father,
was expected to result in the translation of 5 out-of-frame amino acids
and a downstream premature termination codon at position 2185 in exon 5.
Also, in both the affected children and the mother, a large deletion was
found in 1 allele of the STRC gene (606440.0003), indicating that the
affected individuals were genetic compounds.

.0003
DEAFNESS, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 16
STRC, EXON 17-29 DEL

In both the affected children and the mother of one family with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness (603720), Verpy
et al. (2001) detected a large deletion on 1 allele of the STRC gene.
The authors located the 5-prime boundary of the deletion between intron
7 and the 3-prime end of intron 16, and the 3-prime boundary downstream
of the most 3-prime exon, indicating that the deletion extends at least
from exons 17 through 29.

103830	TITLE *103830 ALDO-KETO REDUCTASE FAMILY 1, MEMBER A1; AKR1A1
;;ALDEHYDE REDUCTASE; ALR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2) and aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21;
103880) are monomeric NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases having wide
substrate specificities for carbonyl compounds (summary by Bohren et
al., 1989).

CLONING

Petrash et al. (1981) studied aldose reductase (AR), aldose reductase M
(ARM), and aldehyde reductase (ALR) in a variety of human tissues. Lens
aldose reductase is composed of a single subunit with molecular weight
35 kD, and liver aldehyde reductase is composed of a single subunit of
molecular weight 32 kD. Liver aldose reductase M is composed of 2
nonidentical subunits of molecular weights 35 kD and 42 kD. Lens has
only AR, liver has ARM and ALR, red cells have only ALR, while brain and
placenta have all 3 enzymes. Petrash et al. (1981) suggested that 3
loci--alpha, beta, and delta--code for these enzymes, and that AR is a
monomer of alpha polypeptide, ARM a dimer of alpha and beta subunits,
and ALR a monomer of delta polypeptide.

By screening a liver library with degenerate oligonucleotide primers
based on the protein sequence of liver aldehyde reductase, Bohren et al.
(1989) isolated aldehyde reductase cDNAs. The predicted protein contains
325 amino acids. Aldose reductase and aldehyde reductase share 3
homology domains and are 51% identical overall.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Fujii et al. (1999) mapped the
AKR1A1 gene to chromosome 1p33-p32.

613484	TITLE *613484 SPEN, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; SPEN
;;MSX2-INTERACTING NUCLEAR TARGET; MINT;;
SMART/HDAC1-ASSOCIATED REPRESSOR PROTEIN; SHARP;;
KIAA0929
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SPEN appears to function as a nuclear matrix platform that organizes and
integrates transcriptional responses (Sierra et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned a partial SPEN cDNA, which they
designated KIAA0929. RT-PCR ELISA detected SPEN expression in all adult
and fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined, with
highest expression in adult lung, liver, ovary, and spinal cord.

Newberry et al. (1999) cloned mouse Spen, which they called Mint. The
deduced 3,576-amino acid protein is rich in proline and serine and has a
calculated molecular mass of 390 kD. It has a predicted N-terminal
helical domain with 3 RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and 3 nuclear
localization signals. The C-terminal half of Mint has high coil and beta
stand content and contains an additional nuclear localization signal.
Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected a 12.6-kb transcript
that was highly expressed in testis, with lower levels in brain, spleen,
lung, liver, and kidney. It was also expressed in differentiating mouse
MC3T3E1 calvarial osteoblasts. Fractionation of MC3T3E1 cells showed
that Mint was processed into 110-kD N-terminal and 250-kD C-terminal
protein fragments that accumulated with chromatin and nuclear matrix
fractions.

Using the C terminus of the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (NCOR2;
600848) as bait to screen human pituitary and liver cDNA libraries, Shi
et al. (2001) cloned SPEN, which they called SHARP. The deduced
3,651-amino acid protein contains 3 N-terminal RRMs, a central receptor
interaction domain (RID), and a C-terminal SMRT interaction
domain/repression domain (SID/RD). It also contains 4 consensus nuclear
localization signals. Northern blot analysis detected a SHARP transcript
of more than 12 kb. Highest expression was in brain, testis, spleen, and
thymus, with lower expression in kidney, liver, mammary gland, and skin.
SHARP expression was also detected in several human tumor cell lines.
Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney cells
revealed SHARP in a speckled nuclear localization.

Oswald et al. (2002) reported that SHARP contains 3,664 amino acids.
They identified 4 putative N-terminal RRMs, 5 nuclear localization
signals spaced throughout the molecule, and an RBP (see RBPJ;
147183)-interacting domain following the RID.

GENE FUNCTION

Using far Western analysis, Newberry et al. (1999) found that Msx2
(123101) interacted with Mint in a mouse brain expression library. The 2
proteins cosegregated with topisomerase II (see 126430) in chromatin and
nuclear matrix fractions. Gel shift analysis showed that the Mint RRM
domain bound T- and G-rich sequences, including a large G/T inverted
repeat element in the proximal promoter of rat osteocalcin (OC, or
BGLAP; 112260). Transient expression of the Mint N-terminal domain
suppressed FGF (see 131220)/forskolin-activated Oc promoter. Mint
expression was downregulated with differentiation of MC3T3E1 cells,
concomitant with upregulation of the Oc gene.

Sierra et al. (2004) showed that mouse Mint synergized with Runx2
(600211) to enhance Fgfr2 (176943)-mediated activation of the
osteocalcin FGF-responsive element (OCFRE). The RRM domain of Mint and
activation domain-3 of Runx2 were required for this activity. Confocal
immunofluorescence microscopy showed that nuclear colocalization of Mint
and Runx2 was enhanced by Fgf2 (134920) stimulation, and Mint enhanced
Runx2 activation of multiprotein complexes assembled by the OCFRE. Msx2
functioned as an inhibitor of Runx2-Mint activation of OCFRE. Sierra et
al. (2004) concluded that MINT may serve as a nuclear matrix platform
that organizes and integrates transcriptional responses.

By coimmunoprecipitation of transfected epitope-tagged proteins and by
protein pull-down assays, Shi et al. (2001) showed that SHARP interacted
directly with HDAC1 (601241). HDAC1 readily coimmunoprecipitated with
SHARP and with at least 5 members of the NuRD complex (see MTA1;
603526), and SHARP immunocomplexes displayed histone deacetylase
activity. SHARP also interacted with steroid receptor RNA cofactor SRA
(603819) and repressed SRA-potentiated steroid receptor activity. SHARP
expression was induced in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by estrogen E2
treatment. Shi et al. (2001) concluded that SHARP can function as a
cofactor for both coactivators and corepressors.

The DNA-binding protein CBF1 (RBPJ; 147183) is a transcriptional
repressor. By yeast 2-hybrid screening of embryonic human liver,
followed by protein pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Oswald
et al. (2002) showed that SHARP interacted directly with CBF1 (RBPJ;
147183), a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor. In cotransfection
experiments, SHARP repressed transcription in an HDAC-dependent fashion
and inhibited transactivation mediated by Notch1 (190198).
Overexpression of SHARP in Xenopus embryos induced a neurogenic
phenotype and rescued loss of primary neurogenesis resulting from
overexpression of dominant-active Notch1. Oswald et al. (2002) concluded
that SHARP is recruited by CBF1 to an HDAC corepressor complex that
regulates the Notch signaling pathway.

Salat et al. (2008) found that ETO (RUNX1T1; 133435) interacted directly
with the RD of SHARP in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain
library. ETO also coimmunoprecipitated with RBPJ and SHARP from HEL
cells. Mutation analysis revealed that NHR1 and NHR2 of ETO interacted
with the RD of SHARP. ETO and SHARP colocalized with RBPJ at promoter
regions of Notch target genes. ETO expression augmented SHARP-mediated
repression of reporter gene expression in an HDAC-dependent manner.
Pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC activity completely abrogated the
repressive activity of ETO-RBPJ-SHARP in reporter gene activation.
Knockdown of ETO activated Notch target genes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the SPEN gene to chromosome 1p36.13 based on an
alignment of the SPEN sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB023146) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

148043	TITLE *148043 KERATIN 3; KRT3
;;K3;;
CYTOKERATIN 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytokeratins (keratins) comprise a large family of peptides that combine
to form the intermediate filaments (10-nm fibers) present in the
cytoskeleton in epithelial cells. Type I cytokeratins are acidic and
range from molecular weight 40 to 56.5 kD, whereas type II cytokeratins
are neutral or basic and have molecular weights of 53 to 67 kD. Specific
pairs of heterotypic keratin chains are coexpressed during the various
stages of epithelial differentiation. This pattern of expression of
cytokeratin pairs implies the existence of highly coordinated control of
transcription. The gene for cytokeratin 3 (KRT3), a member of the type
II subfamily, is expressed together with KRT12 (601687) during
'corneal-type' differentiation (Moll et al., 1982; Schermer et al.,
1986; summary by Raimondi et al., 1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

The KRT3 gene is approximately 6.5 kb long and encodes one of the
largest cytokeratin proteins (64 kD) (summary by Raimondi et al., 1994).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Raimondi et al. (1994) mapped the
KRT3 gene to chromosome 12q12-q13. All type II keratin genes mapped to
that time had been assigned to chromosome 12 where they appeared to be
organized into one homotypic cluster.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Meesmann corneal dystrophy (122100) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by fragility of the anterior corneal epithelium where the
KRT12 and KRT3 genes are specifically expressed. Cytoplasmic densities
demonstrated in Meesmann corneal dystrophy (Tremblay and Dube, 1982) are
reminiscent of the tonofilament clumping seen in other dominant keratin
disorders. Furthermore, in K12 knockout mice, a complete loss of the
K3/K12 cytoskeleton results in extreme fragility of corneal
keratinocytes (Kao et al., 1996). Irvine et al. (1997) postulated that
dominant-negative mutations in keratins K3 and K12 might cause Meesmann
corneal dystrophy. They indeed found such mutations. In a Northern
Ireland family they demonstrated linkage between KRT3 and this form of
corneal dystrophy and demonstrated a specific mutation, E509K
(148043.0001), in the KRT3 gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MEESMANN CORNEAL DYSTROPHY
KRT3, GLU509LYS

In a family in Northern Ireland, Irvine et al. (1997) demonstrated that
members with Meesmann corneal dystrophy (MECD; 122100) were heterozygous
for a 1525G-A transition in the KRT3 gene, resulting in a glu509-to-lys
(E509K) substitution. This purine transition was a potential CpG
deamination mutation. An identical CpG mutation in the analogous residue
of the KRT2 gene (600194) is the most frequent cause of ichthyosis
bullosa of Siemens (146800).

615262	TITLE *615262 METHYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE 23; METTL23
;;CHROMOSOME 17 OPEN READING FRAME 95; C17ORF95
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from a donor,
generally S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), to acceptor molecules,
including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and small metabolites. METTL23
belongs to a family of protein lysine methyltransferases that methylate
nonhistone proteins (Cloutier et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to METTL22 (615261),
Cloutier et al. (2013) identified METTL23. The deduced protein is made
up predominantly of a Rossmann fold of alternating beta strands and
alpha helices, with a conserved AdoMet-binding site near the N terminus.
Epitope-tagged METTL23 was predominantly expressed in cytoplasmic
membrane-like structures in transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity purification, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry, Cloutier et
al. (2013) found that METTL23 expressed in HEK293 cells interacted with
HSPA5 (138120), tubulin (see 602529), and UGGT1 (605897). UGGT2 (605898)
and HSP90B1 (191175) were also detected in the immunoprecipitate.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the METTL23 gene to chromosome 17q25.1 based on an
alignment of the METTL23 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC033998) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

609473	TITLE *609473 CINGULIN, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF; CGN
;;KIAA1319
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned CGN, which they designated
KIAA1319. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest CGN expression in liver, testis,
and lung. Intermediate expression was detected in ovary, pancreas,
spinal cord, whole adult brain, fetal liver and brain, and all specific
brain regions examined. No expression was detected in heart, skeletal
muscle, and spleen.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to Xenopus cingulin,
Citi et al. (2000) identified human cingulin. The deduced 1,203-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 137 kD. Cingulin
contains a globular N-terminal head region, a central coiled-coil rod
domain, and a short C-terminal tail. It has a leucine zipper motif,
classical and bipartite nuclear localization signals, and several
potential phosphorylation sites. Human and Xenopus cingulin share 43%
amino acid identity, with highest similarity in the C-terminal tail and
lowest similarity in the N-terminal head domain. Northern blot analysis
detected a 5.2-kb transcript in pancreas, kidney, liver, and lung, but
not in skeletal muscle, placenta, brain, and heart.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Citi et al. (2000) determined that each cingulin molecule is likely to
be a dimer, with the alpha-helical sequences of each subunit assembled
in parallel axial register to form a 2-stranded coiled-coil. Cingulin
dimers may further assemble through antiparallel interactions between
the last 100 amino acids of the coiled-coil region.

GENE FUNCTION

Citi et al. (2000) found that both human and Xenopus cingulin interacted
with canine Zo1 (TJP1; 601009) and Zo2 (TJP2; 607709) in an in vitro
pull-down assay.

D'Atri et al. (2002) found that overexpression of Xenopus cingulin in
transfected Xenopus epithelial cells resulted in disruption of
endogenous Zo1 localization. Pull-down experiments with truncated
Xenopus and human cingulin showed that the N-terminal motifs
independently bound Zo1 and Zo2. Deletion of the Zo1 interaction motif
did not abolish junctional localization of cingulin in transfected
Xenopus epithelial cells, indicating that multiple protein interactions
can recruit cingulin to tight junctions in these cells. D'Atri et al.
(2002) demonstrated that the coiled-coil region of cingulin acts
primarily to promote dimerization.

RhoA (ARHA; 165390) is downregulated when epithelial cells reach
confluence, resulting in inhibition of signaling pathways that stimulate
proliferation. By coimmunoprecipitation, Aijaz et al. (2005) identified
cingulin as a binding partner of endogenous Gefh1 (ARHGEF2; 607560), a
guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA, in Madin-Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cells. Cingulin binding inhibited RhoA activation and
signaling, suggesting that the increase in cingulin expression in
confluent cells inhibits Gefh1 and thereby downregulates RhoA. In
agreement, RNA interference of Gefh1 or transfection of a mutant Gefh1
unable to bind cingulin inhibited G1/S phase transition in MDCK cells.
Depletion of cingulin by regulated RNA interference resulted in RhoA
activation and the development of irregular cell monolayers. Aijaz et
al. (2005) concluded that the formation of epithelial tight junctions
contributes to the downregulation of RhoA by inactivating Gefh1 in a
cingulin-dependent manner.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Citi et al. (2000) mapped the CGN gene to
chromosome 1q21.

PHENOL SULFOTRANSFERASE, THERMOSTABLE FORM; STP;;
ST1A3;;
PHENOL SULFOTRANSFERASE; PPST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SULT1A1 gene encodes a phenol sulfotransferase (STP, or PST) (EC
2.8.2.1), which catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of catecholamines and
of phenolic drugs. There are 3 phenol-preferring SULT isoforms encoded
by 3 genes, SULT1A1, SULT1A2 (601292), and SULT1A3 (600641), which have
also been referred to as STP1, STP2, and STM, respectively. These genes
are highly homologous and are located within a 120-kb region on
chromosome 16p. SULT enzymes are widely distributed in human and animal
tissues, including blood platelets (summary by Raftogianis et al.,
1997).

CLONING

Wilborn et al. (1993) cloned cDNAs encoding SULT1A1, which they called
PPST, from a human liver cDNA library. The full-length cDNA encodes a
deduced 295-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 34.1
kD. The rat and human proteins share 89% amino acid similarity. Northern
blot analysis of human liver detected a 1.3-kb mRNA transcript.

Using PCR, Jones et al. (1995) cloned PPST from human platelet and liver
cDNA libraries.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dooley and Huang (1996) determined the genomic organization of the human
SULT1A1, SULT1A2, and SULT1A3 genes. These 3 genes each have 8 exons
with the initiator methionine in exon 2. All 3 colocalize on a single
cosmid and have a high degree of sequence homology, suggesting that
these 3 genes arose by gene duplication. Dooley and Huang (1996) stated
that the previously identified PST gene sequences PPST, HPST, HAST1, and
HAST2 are isolates of the SULT1A1 gene.

Wilborn et al. (1993) determined that SULT1A1 has 3 putative
polyadenylation signal sequences.

MAPPING

By screening DNA samples from a human-hamster somatic cell hybrid panel
by PCR using an oligonucleotide primer pair, Dooley et al. (1993) mapped
the SULT1A1 gene to human chromosome 16p. PCR amplification on a
human-mouse somatic cell hybrid panel containing defined portions of
chromosome 16 showed that SULT1A1 is located proximal to the gene for
protein kinase C, beta-1 polypeptide (176970), in the region
16p12.1-p11.2.

Her et al. (1996) identified a second thermostable phenol
sulfotransferase, SULT1A2, which also maps to chromosome 16; see 601292.
Raftogianis et al. (1996) found that the SULT1A1 gene is located
approximately 45 kb 5-prime upstream from the SULT1A2 gene.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Dooley et al. (1993) mapped the
mouse Sult1a1 gene to chromosome 7. Khan et al. (1995) also mapped the
Sult1a1 gene to mouse chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Wilborn et al. (1993) observed significant increases in sulfotransferase
activity toward 2 PST-specific substrates, minoxidil and 4-nitrophenol,
in cytosol prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with human PPST. PPST
appeared to function as a homodimer.

By assaying transfected Chinese hamster fibroblasts, Jones et al. (1995)
showed that cytosolic human PPST sulfated 1-naphthol, 4-nitrophenol, and
phenol. It showed lower activity with tyramine, dopamine, noradrenalin,
and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol, and had no activity toward
dehydroepiandrosterone and estrone.

Kester et al. (1999) investigated sulfation of the prohormone T4, the
active hormone T3, and the metabolites rT3 and 3,3-prime-diiodothyronine
(3,3-prime-T2) by human liver and kidney cytosol sulfotransferases as
well as by recombinant human SULT1A1 and SULT1A3. In all cases, the most
preferred substrate was 3,3-prime-T2, followed by rT3, T3, and T4 (most
preferred to least preferred, respectively). These results indicated
similar substrate specificities for iodothyronine sulfation by native
human liver and kidney sulfotransferases and recombinant SULT1A1 and
SULT1A3. Of the latter, SULT1A1 clearly showed the highest affinity for
iodothyronines, but it remained to be established whether SULT1A1 is the
prominent isoenzyme for sulfation of thyroid hormone in human liver and
kidney.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Gamage et al. (2003) solved the crystal structure of SULT1A1 to
1.9-angstrom resolution. They found that, like other SULTs, SULT1A1
formed a central 5-stranded parallel beta sheet surrounded on either
side by helices. The L-shaped substrate-binding site was highly
hydrophobic and accommodated 2 p-nitrophenol molecules. Kinetic analysis
revealed a slight deviation from Michaelis-Menten kinetics at low
concentrations of p-nitrophenol, suggestive of positive cooperativity,
although higher concentrations resulted in substrate inhibition. The
substrate-binding site accepted a single T2 molecule, with the 2 phenyl
rings of T2 occupying each of the 2 p-nitrophenol-binding sites. The
substrate 17-beta-estradiol caused a conformational change in the
SULT1A1 substrate-binding site, suggesting that this rearrangement
underlies the low affinity SULT1A1 shows toward this sterol.

Using molecular modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic
analysis, Barnett et al. (2004) showed that phe247 of SULT1A1 interacted
with both p-nitrophenol molecules in the active site and was required
for substrate inhibition.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Evidence that inheritance contributes to differences in levels of the 2
forms of the SULT1A1 enzyme in Caucasians was presented by Reveley et
al. (1982), Price et al. (1988), and Van Loon and Weinshilboum (1984).

Anderson and Jackson (1984) showed that the mean basal level of platelet
thermostable PST (TS PST) activity in American blacks is significantly
higher than the mean basal level in whites, whereas the average platelet
thermolabile PST activity does not differ significantly between the 2
groups. Anderson et al. (1988) suggested that the findings are a first
step toward testing the hypothesis that inheritance may be a factor in
the regulation of basal levels of activity and thermostability of
platelet PST.

Raftogianis et al. (1997) identified a common variant allele of the
SULT1A1 gene, termed SULT1A1*2 (dbSNP rs9282861), that was uniformly
associated with both very low TS PST activity and low thermal stability.
The variant allele, 638G-A transition in exon 7, resulted in an
arg213-to-his (R213H) substitution. The allele frequency of SULT1A1*2 in
a population sample of 150 Caucasian blood donors was 0.31 (31%),
indicating that approximately 9% of this population would be homozygous
for that allele. Overall, Raftogianis et al. (1997) identified 13
SULT1A1 alleles encoding 4 allozymes.

Coughtrie et al. (1999) found the variant SULT1A1*2 allele at
frequencies of 0.321 and 0.269 in 293 U.K. Caucasian and 52 Nigerian
African individuals, respectively. This allele codes for an allozyme
with low enzyme activity and stability compared to the wildtype
(SULT1A1*1) enzyme. Therefore, the SULT1A1 genotype may influence
susceptibility to mutagenicity following exposure to heterocyclic amines
and other environmental toxins. Accordingly, Coughtrie et al. (1999)
found an age-related difference in SULT1A1 genotype within the Caucasian
population, with increasing incidence of SULT1A1*1 homozygosity and
decreasing incidence of SULT1A1*2 homozygosity with increasing age.
These findings suggested a possible association of SULT1A1*1 allozyme
with protection against cell or tissue damage during aging.

Bamber et al. (2001) compared the frequency of the most common SULT1A1
alleles in 226 colorectal cancer patients and 293 previously described
control patients. There was no significant difference in allele
frequency between the control and cancer patient populations, nor was
there a significant association with any of the clinical parameters
studied, including Duke classification, differentiation, site, nodal
involvement, and survival. However, when the age-related difference in
allele frequency was considered, a significantly reduced risk of
colorectal cancer was associated with homozygosity for SULT1A1*1 (odds
ratio = 0.47) in subjects under the age of 80 years. These results
suggested that the high activity SULT1A1*1 alloallele protects against
dietary and/or environmental chemicals involved in the pathogenesis of
colorectal cancer.

Using a quantitative multiplex PCR assay, Hebbring et al. (2007) found
that 17 (4.7%) of 362 Caucasian American individuals had 1 copy of the
SULT1A1 gene (i.e., a deletion) and 26% had 3 or more copies. Among 99
African Americans tested, 62 (62.6%) had 3 or more copies. The
variability in the level of enzyme activity among 23 human platelet and
267 human liver samples was best explained by gene copy number
differences when all sources of genetic variability, including the
SULT1A1*2 allele, were considered (p less than 0.0001). Overall, these
results indicated that the presence of SULT1A1 gene deletions and
duplications represent the major source of variability in the metabolic
activity of this enzyme.

HISTORY

Early studies showed the existence of 2 phenol SULT isoforms based on
biochemical studies: a thermolabile, or monoamine-metabolizing (SULT1A3;
600641), form and a thermostable, or phenol-metabolizing, form (SULT1A1)
(summary by Raftogianis et al., 1997).

120105	TITLE *120105 COLIPASE, PANCREATIC; CLPS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pancreatic colipase is a 12-kD polypeptide cofactor for pancreatic
lipase (EC 3.1.1.3; 246600), an enzyme essential for the absorption of
dietary long-chain triglyceride fatty acids. Colipase is thought to
anchor lipase noncovalently to the surface of lipid micelles,
counteracting the destabilizing influence of intestinal bile salts
(summary by Davis et al., 1991).

CLONING

Using primers derived from the known amino acid sequence, Davis et al.
(1991) employed the PCR to produce a cDNA clone corresponding to the
complete coding region of the human procolipase mRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sims and Lowe (1992) found that the CLPS gene has 3 exons and that the
5-prime-flanking region contains a TATA box, a GC box, and a 28-bp
region with homology to the rat pancreatic-specific enhancer.

MAPPING

By the study of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids, Davis et al. (1991)
determined that the CLPS gene is located in the region 6pter-p21.1.

Sims and Lowe (1992) confirmed the assignment of the CLPS gene to
chromosome 6 by blots of hamster-human somatic cell hybrid DNA using the
entire colipase cDNA.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2006) reported a mechanism by which constant darkness
regulates the gene expression of fat catabolic enzymes in mice. Genes
for murine procolipase (Clps) and pancreatic lipase-related protein-2
(Plrp2; 604423) are activated in a circadian manner in peripheral organs
during 12-hour dark:12-hour dark (DD) but not light-dark (LD) cycles.
This mechanism is deregulated in circadian-deficient Per1/Per2 double
mutant mice. Zhang et al. (2006) identified circadian-regulated
5-prime-AMP, which is elevated in the blood of DD mice, as a key
mediator of this response. Synthetic 5-prime-AMP induced torpor (a
hibernation-like state) and murine Clps expression in LD mice. Torpor
induced by metabolic stress was associated with elevated 5-prime-AMP
levels in DD mice. Levels of glucose and nonesterified fatty acid in the
blood were reversed in DD and LD mice. Induction of murine Clps
expression by 5-prime-AMP in LD mice was reciprocally linked to blood
glucose levels. Zhang et al. (2006) concluded that their findings
uncovered a circadian metabolic rhythm in mammals.

607707	TITLE *607707 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE II-BETA; CAMK2B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CAMK2B belongs to a family of type II multifunctional calcium- and
calmodulin (see 114180)-dependent protein kinases. There are at least 4
CAMK2 genes, and each yields several isoforms through alternative
splicing. CAMK2B is a prominent kinase in the central nervous system and
may function in long-term potentiation and neurotransmitter release.

CLONING

Tombes and Krystal (1997) cloned a number of CAMK2B variants from
several human tumor cell line and brain cDNA libraries. CAMK2B showed
wide tissue and cell distribution, but 1 variant predominated in adult
brain. The expression of other variants depended upon the tissue of
origin and whether the source was normal or tumor tissue.

By searching an EST database using rat Camk2 as query, followed by
screening a brain cDNA library, Li et al. (2001) obtained a full-length
cDNA encoding CAMK2B. The deduced protein contains 542 amino acids. A
comparison of CAMK2B and CAMK2A (114078) detected no amino acid changes
within the functional domains, including the ATP-binding site, the
calmodulin-binding domain, and autophosphorylation sites. Northern blot
analysis detected a major 3.9-kb transcript in adult and fetal brain;
expression was slightly lower in fetal brain. Using PCR primers designed
to identify alternatively spliced isoforms, Li et al. (2001) identified
3 CAMK2B isoforms in adult and fetal brain. Like other CAMK2 isoforms,
the CAMK2B isoforms have an insertion or deletion of 11 to 39 amino
acids within the central variable region.

Wang et al. (2000) identified and cloned CAMK2B by searching an EST
database using mouse Camk2b. They obtained a full-length cDNA by 5-prime
RACE of a brain cDNA library. Wang et al. (2000) also identified 5
splice variants resulting from alternative splicing within 7 central
variable domains, termed V1 to V7. The deduced proteins have calculated
molecular masses between 49 and 60 kD. Transient transfection of 3
CAMK2B variants in HEK293 cells revealed that all 3 were cytosolic
proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2000) showed that full-length CAMK2B and a variant lacking
V1 displayed Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity against a
peptide substrate. Another variant lacking V1 through V5 did not exhibit
significant kinase activity under the same conditions.

By Western blot analysis, Thiagarajan et al. (2002) found that the
protein levels of Camk2a and Camk2b were inversely related during
activity in cultured rat pup hippocampal neurons. The levels of Camk2a
increased with heightened activity, and the levels of Camk2b increased
with suppression of activity. Thiagarajan et al. (2002) hypothesized
that the change in the ratio may help tune the Camk2 holoenzyme to
changing intensities of Ca(2+) signaling.

Novak et al. (2000) determined that expression of CAMK2B mRNA was
elevated about 2-fold in postmortem frontal cortex of schizophrenia
(181500) patients relative to controls.

Konig et al. (2010) used an integrative systems approach, based on
genomewide RNA interference screening, to identify 295 cellular
cofactors required for early-stage influenza virus replication. Within
this group, those involved in kinase-regulated signaling,
ubiquitination, and phosphatase activity are the most highly enriched,
and 181 factors assemble into a highly significant host-pathogen
interaction network. Moreover, 219 of the 295 factors were confirmed to
be required for efficient wildtype influenza virus growth, and further
analysis of a subset of genes showed 23 factors essential for viral
entry, including members of the vacuolar ATPase (see 192132) and COPI
(see 601924) protein families, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)
proteins, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-beta (605004).
Furthermore, 10 proteins were confirmed to be involved in post-entry
steps of influenza virus replication. These include nuclear import
components, proteases, and CAMK2B. Notably, growth of swine-origin HIN1
influenza virus is also dependent on the identified host factors, and
Konig et al. (2010) showed that small molecule inhibitors of several
factors, including vATPase and CAMK2B, antagonize influenza virus
replication.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2000) determined that the variable region of the CAMK2B
protein is encoded by at least 7 exons. Alternative splicing within this
region gives rise to CAMK2B variants.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wang et al. (2000) mapped the CAMK2B gene
to chromosome 7.

602235	TITLE *602235 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, KQT-LIKE SUBFAMILY, MEMBER 2; KCNQ2
;;POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, SUBFAMILY Q, MEMBER 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The KCNQ2 gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that is
expressed in the brain (Biervert et al., 1998).

CLONING

In the course of a search for the mutational basis of benign familial
neonatal seizures (BFNS1; 121200) mapping to chromosome 20, Singh et al.
(1998) identified a novel voltage-gated potassium channel gene that
showed significant homology to KVLQT1 (also known as KCNQ1 and KCNA9),
the chromosome 11 potassium channel gene responsible for long QT
syndrome-1 (192500) and a form of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen
cardioauditory syndrome (220400). A single cDNA isolated with the D20S24
probe in this region showed significant homology with KVLQT1. Singh et
al. (1998) found that the KCNQ2 cDNA hybridized to transcripts of
approximately 1.5, 3.8, and 9.5 kb on Northern blots made from brain.

By positional cloning from the 20q13.3 region where 1 form of benign
familial neonatal seizures is known to map, Biervert et al. (1998)
independently isolated the KCNQ2 gene and found that it was expressed in
brain.

Yang et al. (1998) described the cloning, tissue distribution, and
functional expression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 (602232), both of which are
associated with benign neonatal epilepsy. The deduced 871-amino acid
KCNQ2 protein has features of a voltage-gated potassium channel.
Northern blot analysis of 8 human tissues detected an 8.5-kb KCNQ2
transcript in brain only. Within brain, highest expression of KCNQ2 was
detected in cerebellar cortex, amygdala, caudate nucleus, and
hippocampus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Biervert and Steinlein (1999) determined that the KCNQ2 gene has at
least 18 exons, occupying more than 50 kb of genomic DNA. Splice
variants were identified. For example, in fetal brain, exon 8 was absent
in all transcripts, while this exon was present in clones derived from
adult brain RNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Biervert et al. (1998) found that expression of human KCNQ2 in Xenopus
laevis oocytes led to potassium-selective currents that activated slowly
with depolarization.

The M channel is a slowly activating and deactivating potassium
conductance that plays a critical role in determining the subthreshold
electroexcitability of neurons as well as the responsiveness to synaptic
inputs. The M current was first described in peripheral sympathetic
neurons, and differential expression of this conductance produces
subtypes of sympathetic neurons with distinct firing patterns. The M
channel is also expressed in many neurons in the central nervous system.
Wang et al. (1998) showed that the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channel subunits can
coassemble to form a channel with essentially identical biophysical
properties and pharmacologic sensitivities to the native M channel and
that the pattern of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 gene expression is consistent with
these genes encoding the native M channel.

Yang et al. (1998) demonstrated that KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, both of which are
associated with benign neonatal epilepsy, interact functionally with
each other and with KCNE1 (176261), which is mutant in a form of Jervell
and Lange-Nielsen syndrome and in 1 form of long QT syndrome.

Cooper et al. (2000) provided information regarding the in vivo
distribution and biochemical characteristics of human brain KCNQ2 and
KCNQ3, the 2 channel subunits that form M channels when expressed in
vitro, and, when mutated, cause the dominantly inherited epileptic
syndrome, benign familial neonatal seizures. They found that the KCNQ2
and KCNQ3 proteins are colocalized in a somatodendritic pattern on
pyramidal and polymorphic neurons in the human cortex and hippocampus.
Immunoreactivity for KCNQ2, but not KCNQ3, is also prominent in some
terminal fields, suggesting a presynaptic role for a distinct subgroup
of M channels in the regulation of action potential propagation and
neurotransmitter release. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 could be coimmunoprecipitated
from brain lysates. Further, both proteins were coassociated with
tubulin (see 602529) and protein kinase A (see 176911) within a triton
X-100-insoluble protein complex. Cooper et al. (2000) suggested that
these studies provided a view of a signaling complex that may be
important for cognitive function as well as epilepsy, and that analysis
of this complex may shed light on the transduction pathway linking
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (see 118510) activation to M-channel
inhibition.

By recording channel currents produced in cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes,
Zhang et al. (2003) found that phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
(PIP2) activated all members of the KCNQ channel family analyzed,
including human KCNQ2 and heterodimers of human KCNQ2 and rat Kcnq3.
Similar results were obtained with mammalian cells expressing KCNQ2 and
Kcnq3. Mutation of his328-to-cys in KCNQ2 and his330-to-cys in Kcnq3
reduced or eliminated PIP2-mediated channel activation. Wortmannin, a
pharmacologic inhibitor of PIP2 regeneration, slowed the recovery from
PIP2 hydrolysis and decreased the sensitivity of the KCNQ2/Kcnq3 channel
to PIP2. Zhang et al. (2003) concluded that PIP2 acts as a
membrane-diffusible second messenger to regulate the activity of KCNQ
currents.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Benign Familial Neonatal Seizures 1

In affected members of a family with benign familial neonatal seizures-1
(BFNS1; 121200), Singh et al. (1998) identified a small deletion on
chromosome 20q encompassing the KCNQ2 gene. The finding was confirmed by
fluorescence in situ hybridization in an affected individual who
presented with seizures beginning at 3 days and had 118 generalized
seizures until the age of 23 days. A single seizure was observed at 3.5
months in conjunction with an acute infection of the middle ear with
fever, but no seizures were observed thereafter. Singh et al. (1998)
also identified different heterozygous mutations in the KCNQ2 gene (see,
e.g., 602235.0001 and 602235.0002) in additional families with BFNS1.

In a large pedigree with BFNS1, Biervert et al. (1998) found a 5-bp
insertion (602235.0003) that was predicted to delete more than 300 amino
acids from the C terminus of KCNQ2. Expression of the mutant channel did
not yield measurable currents. Thus, impairment of potassium-dependent
repolarization was indicated as the cause of this age-specific epileptic
syndrome.

Dedek et al. (2001) reported a Caucasian family in which BFNS was
followed later in life by myokymia, involuntary contractions of skeletal
muscles (see 121200). All affected members of the family carried an
arg207-to-trp mutation (R207W; 602235.0006) that neutralized a charged
amino acid in the S4 voltage-sensor segment of KCNQ2. This substitution
led to a shift of voltage-dependent activation of KCNQ2 and a dramatic
slowing of activation upon depolarization. Myokymia was thought to
result from hyperexcitability of the lower motoneuron; indeed both KCNQ2
and KCNQ3 mRNAs were detected in the anterior horn of the spinal cord
where the cells of the lower motoneurons arise. Dedek et al. (2001)
proposed that a difference in firing patterns between motoneurons and
central neurons, combined with the drastically slowed voltage activation
of the R207W mutant, explained by this particular KCNQ2 mutant caused
myokymia in addition to BFNC. Wuttke et al. (2007) identified a mutation
in the KCNQ2 gene (R207Q; 602235.0011) in a patient with isolated
myokymia.

Heron et al. (2007) identified 3 deletions and 1 duplication of more
than 1 exon of the KCNQ2 gene in 4 (44%) of 9 unrelated families with
benign familial neonatal seizures who had previously tested negative for
coding or splice site mutations. The changes were predicted to result in
haploinsufficiency. The authors suggested that multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) should be a second-tier
testing strategy in candidate cases.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 7

In a mother and son with severe epilepsy, Dedek et al. (2003) identified
a heterozygous mutation in the KCNQ2 gene (602235.0008). Both patients
had an atypical course characterized by drug-resistant seizures
necessitating ACTH treatment. In addition, the son developed early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy with delayed psychomotor development
(EIEE7; 613720). Functional expression studies showed that the S247W
mutation reduced channel currents by more than 50% in homomeric KCNQ2
channels. Dedek et al. (2003) emphasized that some KCNQ2 mutations may
be associated with a more severe phenotype than is typical for BFNC.

Weckhuysen et al. (2012) identified 7 different heterozygous mutations
in the KCNQ2 gene (see, e.g., 602235.0012-602235.0014) in 8 (10%) of 80
patients with neonatal or early infantile seizures and associated
psychomotor retardation. The mutations arose de novo in 7 cases; in 1
case, a severely affected patient inherited the mutation from her
father, who had a milder phenotype and was mosaic for the mutation. The
findings indicated that KCNQ2 mutations can occur in a substantial
proportion of patients with EIEE.

ANIMAL MODEL

The electroconvulsive threshold (ECT) test has been used extensively to
determine the protection conferred by antiepileptic drug candidates
against induced seizures in rodents. Yang et al. (2003) adopted the ECT
test to screen the progeny of ethylnitrosourea-treated male C57BL/6J
mice. In a small-scale screen, several mutant lines conferring a low
threshold to ECT minimal clonic seizures were mapped to the telomeric
region of mouse chromosome 2 in independent founder families. Genetic
and physical mapping data indicated that several lines shared a single
mutation, Szt1 (seizure threshold-1), consisting of a 300-kb deletion of
genomic DNA involving 3 known genes. Two of these genes, Kcnq2 and
Chrna4 (118504), are known to be mutated in human epilepsy families.
Szt1 homozygotes and heterozygotes displayed similar phenotypes to those
found in the respective Kcnq2 knockout mutant mice, suggesting that
Kcnq2 haploinsufficiency may lie at the root of the Szt1 seizure
sensitivity.

In affected members of a family with benign familial neonatal seizures
(121200), Singh et al. (1998) demonstrated a TAC-to-TGC transition
converting codon 284 from tyrosine to cysteine. The family was too small
to permit demonstration of linkage to chromosome 20. The mutation
occurred in the pore region of the channel.

In their BFNS kindred 1705, Singh et al. (1998) demonstrated that
individuals affected with benign familial neonatal seizures (121200) had
an ala306-to-thr (A306T) amino acid substitution in the S6 transmembrane
segment. This alanine residue was conserved in all members of the
Shaker, Shab, Shaw, and Shal subfamilies of potassium channels.

KCNQ2, 5-BP INS

Biervert et al. (1998) identified an insertional mutation in the KCNQ2
gene in a large Australian Caucasian pedigree with benign familial
neonatal seizures (121200) previously reported by Berkovic et al.
(1994). Biervert et al. (1998) found a heterozygous 5-bp insertion at
the triplet encoding amino acid 534 in a segment highly conserved
between KCNQ2 and KCNQ1 (607542), which is mutated in type 1 long QT
syndrome (192500). The resulting frameshift was predicted to cause a
premature stop, which would truncate more than 300 amino acids. Of 13
affected family members, 10 had known neonatal seizures. Two patients
had afebrile seizures later, 1 of whom did not have neonatal seizures.
One mutation carrier was unaffected, indicating reduced penetrance.
Berkovic et al. (1994) noted the phenotypic heterogeneity in this
family.

KCNQ2, 1-BP DEL, 1846T

In a patient with benign familial neonatal seizures (121200), Biervert
and Steinlein (1999) identified a 1-bp deletion, 1846delT, in the KCNQ2
gene which caused a frameshift in exon 16, removing 228 amino acids from
the predicted wildtype sequence and replacing them with a stretch of 283
amino acids showing a completely different sequence. The mutation was
also present in the DNA sample obtained from the father but not in that
from the mother. The paternal grandmother reportedly had also suffered
from neonatal seizures but was not available for study.

KCNQ2, ARG214TRP

In a 4-generation Italian family segregating benign familial neonatal
seizures (121200), del Giudice et al. (2000) identified a 686C-T
mutation in exon 3 of the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an arg214-to-trp
substitution. The mutation was found in the 8 affected members of the
pedigree and in 1 unaffected subject who was an obligate carrier. The
mutation occurred in the transmembrane domain S4, neutralizing one of
the conserved, positively charged residues of that segment. The
substitution abolished an AgeI restriction site and was not detected in
150 Italian controls.

SEIZURES, BENIGN FAMILIAL NEONATAL, 1, AND/OR MYOKYMIA
KCNQ2, ARG207TRP

In 5 affected members of a Caucasian family with BFNS and/or myokymia
(see 121200), Dedek et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous C-to-T
transition in exon 3 of the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an arg207-to-trp
(R207W) substitution in the fourth transmembrane domain. Three mutation
carriers had BFNS with myokymia, 1 had isolated myokymia without
seizures, and 1 had neonatal seizures with no clinical signs of
myokymia, although electromyography demonstrated spontaneous discharges
of grouped motor unit potentials. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutation resulted in a shift of voltage-dependent
activation of KCNQ2 and a dramatic slowing of activation upon
depolarization. The loss of potassium current was more severe compared
to other KCNQ2 mutations and showed a dominant-negative effect.

In a patient with isolated myokymia and no history of neonatal seizures,
Wuttke et al. (2007) identified an R207Q mutation (602235.0011) in the
same codon as the R207W mutation. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that mutant R207W and R207Q channels had large depolarizing
shifts and marked slowing of activation time compared to wildtype
channels. Coexpression with wildtype channels showed a dominant-negative
effect reducing the current amplitude by 70% after short depolarization.

KCNQ2, LYS526ASN

In 4 affected members of a family with BFNS1 (121200), Borgatti et al.
(2004) identified a heterozygous 1620G-A transition in the KCNQ2 gene,
resulting in a lys526-to-asn (K526N) substitution in the C-terminal
region of the protein. The mutation is located in a highly conserved
region within alpha-helix B that is necessary for calmodulin binding.
Functional expression studies showed that the K526N mutation decreased
the voltage-dependence of the channel. Although 2 patients had a
phenotype consistent with typical BFNS, the other 2 patients had a
complex phenotype that was atypical and severe, consistent with an
encephalopathy (EIEE7; 613720). One developed an extremely unfavorable
outcome, profound mental retardation, and spastic quadriparesis. The
other continued to have focal seizures until late infancy with a
moderate degree of mental retardation and a mild cerebellar syndrome.
Borgatti et al. (2004) noted that some patients with BFNS may experience
seizures later in life or a different set of epileptic subtypes
sometimes associated with severe neurologic and intellectual impairment.
Overall, the clinical, genetic, and functional data did not provide a
definitive explanation for the wide range of phenotypic variability
observed in the described family, therefore preventing
genotype-phenotype correlations. The authors postulated that the
phenotypic variability could be due to the interplay of pathogenic
mutations, modifier genes, and more subtle environmental factors.

For a similar EIEE7 phenotype, see Dedek et al. (2003) and 602235.0008.

KCNQ2, SER247TRP

In a mother and son with severe epilepsy, Dedek et al. (2003) identified
a heterozygous C-to-G transversion in exon 5 of the KCNQ2 gene,
resulting in a ser247-to-trp (S247W) substitution in the fifth
transmembrane residue of the protein. The mutation was not identified in
202 control chromosomes. Both patients had an atypical course
characterized by drug-resistant seizures necessitating ACTH treatment.
In addition, the son developed epileptic encephalopathy with delayed
psychomotor development (EIEE7; 613720). Functional expression studies
showed that the S247W mutation reduced channel currents by more than 50%
in homomeric KCNQ2 channels. Dedek et al. (2003) emphasized that some
KCNQ2 mutations may be associated with a more severe phenotype than is
typical for BFNS.

KCNQ2, 10-BP DEL/1-BP INS, NT761

In 9 affected members of a large Italian family with BFNS1 (121200),
Bassi et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 10-bp deletion and 1-bp
insertion (761del10insA) in the KCNQ2 gene, resulting in a truncated
N-terminal peptide of 194 residues. The resultant mutant protein lacks
the S4 domain, which is critical for voltage sensing. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the mutant KCNQ2 subunit was
unable to form functional homomeric potassium channels, suggesting
haploinsufficiency rather than a dominant-negative effect. One affected
family member developed severe epilepsy associated with mild mental
retardation and persistent neurologic problems in adult life (EIEE7;
613720); this phenotypic variability was considered by the authors to be
consistent with the fact that 10 to 15% of BFNS individuals experience
seizure manifestations later in life.

heterozygous 1-bp deletion (2127delT) in the last exon of the KCNQ2
gene, resulting in a replacement of the C terminus with 219 new amino
acids and a protein that is 56 residues longer than the wildtype

In a 25-year-old Egyptian man with isolated myokymia (see 121200),
Wuttke et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in the
KCNQ2 gene, resulting in an arg207-to-gln (R207Q) substitution in a
highly conserved residue in the voltage sensor region of the potassium
channel. He had no history of neonatal seizures and no family history of
epilepsy or peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. Clinically, he had
permanent muscle overactivity in the distal upper extremities and small
amplitude movements of the fingers, which were not disabling. However,
he also reported exercise-induced cramps of both hands since childhood
and 4 episodes of exercise-induced generalized muscle stiffness. EMG
showed spontaneous irregular discharges consistent with myokymia. Wuttke
et al. (2007) noted that a mutation in the same codon (R207W;
602235.0006) had been associated with neonatal epilepsy and/or myokymia.
In vitro functional expression studies showed that mutant R207W and
R207Q channels had large depolarizing shifts and marked slowing of
activation time compared to wildtype channels. Coexpression with
wildtype channels showed a dominant-negative effect reducing the current
amplitude by 70% after short depolarization.

arg213-to-gln (R213Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
transmembrane domain. The mutation was not found in 276 control
individuals. The patient had onset of multiple daily seizures on the
second day of life, and the mother had noted jerking movements during
pregnancy. The patient had poor response to treatment, but the seizures
remitted at age 14 months. However, at age 2 years 10 months, she had
severe psychomotor retardation, could not roll over, was nonverbal, had
severe spastic quadriplegia, and some dysmorphic features. Her father,
who had benign neonatal seizures and myokymia, was mosaic for the
mutation, which was found in 30% of his lymphocytes.

resulting in a met546-to-val (M546V) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in one of the calmodulin binding domains in the C-terminal
region. The mutation was not found in 276 control individuals. On the
third day of life, the patient had onset of multiple daily tonic
seizures resistant to treatment and associated with a burst suppression
pattern on EEG that evolved into multifocal epileptic activity. Seizures
remitted at age 3 years and the EEG was normal at age 8. However, he had

300089	TITLE *300089 ISOCITRATE DEHYDROGENASE 3, GAMMA SUBUNIT; IDH3G
;;ISOCITRATE DEHYDROGENASE, NAD(+)-SPECIFIC, MITOCHONDRIAL, GAMMA SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION Brenner et al. (1997) presented the entire genomic sequence, as well as
the cDNA sequence, of the human gene encoding the gamma subunit of the
NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH-gamma). The gene,
symbolized IDH3G, is located in the region Xq28, approximately 70 kb
telomeric to the ABCD1 gene (300371) and adjacent to the TRAP-delta gene
(300090), which they also cloned. The sequences of the transcripts of
IDH-gamma and TRAP-delta were obtained by searching the EST database
with genomic data. Identified ESTs were completely sequenced and
assembled to cDNAs comprising the entire coding region. For IDH-gamma,
several EST clones indicated differential splicing. The 2 genes are
arranged in a compact head-to-head manner. The nontranscribed intergenic
region comprises only 133 bp and is embedded in a CpG island. Brenner et
al. (1997) concluded that the CpG island functions as a bidirectional
promoter to initiate the transcription of both functionally unrelated
genes with quite distinct expression patterns. Brenner et al. (1997)
showed that in both rat and mouse, this region of the genome is
similarly compact and comprises less than 249 bp in rat and not more
than 164 bp in mouse. In both cases this intergenic region is embedded
in a CpG island and is highly conserved, with nucleotide identity values
ranging from 70.1% between human and rat to 92.6% between mouse and rat.

In a male patient with periventricular heterotopia (300049) and a large
duplication of Xq28 reported by Fink et al. (1997), Fox et al. (1998)
found that the centromeric boundary of the duplicated segment of Xq28
was base 3377 of the 3,395 bases of intron 1 of the IDH3G gene,
approximately 600 kb distal to DXS15.

609561	TITLE *609561 CARBOXYPEPTIDASE A5; CPA5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Carboxypeptidases have functions ranging from digestion of food to
selective biosynthesis of neuroendocrine peptides. Members of the A/B
subfamily of carboxypeptidases, such as CPA5, contain an approximately
90-amino acid pro region that assists in the folding of the active
carboxypeptidase domain. Cleavage of the pro region activates the enzyme
(Wei et al., 2002).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to CPA1 (114850) and CPB1
(114852), Wei et al. (2002) identified CPA5. The deduced 436-amino acid
protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a pro domain
and a carboxypeptidase catalytic domain that includes residues involved
in zinc coordination and substrate catalysis and a single disulfide
bond. CPA5 ESTs were found in testis, adult brain, and fetal heart cDNA
libraries. One of the CPA5 sequences from testis contains an alternative
exon 2 (exon 2B) not found in the other CPA5 sequences. Northern blot
analysis of mouse tissues detected Cpa5 expression in testis, but not in
kidney, liver, brain, and lung. RT-PCR detected expression in mouse
testis and pancreas and in a mouse pituitary corticotrophic cell line,
but not in any other mouse tissues examined. In situ hybridization
revealed stage-specific expression of Cpa5 in germ cells of mouse
testis. Cpa5 was also expressed in the anterior and intermediate lobes
of the pituitary, but not in the neural lobe.

GENE FUNCTION

Modeling analysis by Wei et al. (2002) predicted that, like CPA1, CPA2
(600688), and CPA3 (114851), CPA5 cleaves substrates with C-terminal
hydrophobic residues. Wei et al. (2002) found that CPA5 cleaved a
synthetic substrate, furylacryloyl-gly-leu, following removal of its pro
domain. CPA5 activity was much greater at pH 7.4 than at pH 5.6.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wei et al. (2002) determined that the CPA5 gene contains 14 exons,
including 2 alternative second exons, exons 2A and 2B. Exons 1, 2A, and
2B of CPA5 are noncoding.

MAPPING

Wei et al. (2002) mapped the CPA5 gene to a CPA gene cluster on
chromosome 7. The order of the genes is CPA2--CPA4 (607635)--CPA5--CPA1.
Bentley et al. (2003) determined that the CPA gene cluster containing
CPA5 maps to chromosome 7q32.

PROTOONCOGENE BCD1;;
TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ZF9; ZF9;;
CORE PROMOTER ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN; COPEB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) family and related
genes do not have TATA boxes or the initiator in their promoter regions.
To identify proteins that regulate PSG gene expression, Koritschoner et
al. (1997) screened a placenta expression library with the core promoter
element (CPE) from PSG5 (176394). They isolated cDNAs encoding a protein
that they called 'core promoter element-binding protein' (CBPB or
COPEB). By sequence analysis, Koritschoner et al. (1997) found 2
possible translation initiation codons, use of which would produce
predicted proteins of either 283 or 290 amino acids. COPEB contains an
N-terminal acidic domain, a serine/threonine-rich central region, and 3
contiguous zinc finger domains in the C-terminal region. The in vitro
COPEB translation product had a mass of 32 kD by SDS-PAGE. Using
mammalian cells expressing COPEB, Koritschoner et al. (1997) showed that
COPEB is capable of activating transcription approximately 4-fold from
the PSG5 promoter. A Gal4-COPEB fusion protein activated transcription
from a heterologous promoter containing Gal4 binding sites. Northern
blot analysis revealed that COPEB is expressed as a 4.5-kb mRNA in
several tissues, with the highest levels in placenta.

El Rouby and Newcomb (1996) identified a novel protooncogene expressed
in B cells, designated BCD1 by them. They cloned it from the peripheral
blood lymphocytes of a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient
through its capacity to transform NIH 3T3 cells. The expression of the
BCD1 gene was limited to 2 tissues, CD19+ B-cells and testis of normal
individuals. Malignant B cells from 50% of patients with B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia studied showed no detectable BCD1 gene transcripts;
however, when malignant B cells were stimulated to undergo terminal
differentiation into plasma cells, BCD1 gene expression was induced,
suggesting an association with B-cell maturation. Since the BCD1
sequence was isolated from a leukemia patient, Patrito and Bocco (1998)
suggested that the sequence differences between COPEB and BCD1 arose as
a consequence of tumor development. The differences may be due to a
rearrangement between COPEB and another ubiquitously expressed protein,
resulting in a fusion protein, or to multiple mutations in COPEB.

Wound repair in parenchymal tissues requires coordinate changes in
resident mesenchymal cells that ultimately lead to fibrosis. In the
liver, this response involves hepatic stellate cells, which are a
nonparenchymal cell type located in the subendothelial space of the
sinusoid. Stellate cells express the myogenic intermediate filament
desmin, and, in normal liver, are the primary storage site for
retinoids, which are found in cytoplasmic droplets in retinyl esters.
Analogous cells in other organs include mesangial cells in kidney and
pulmonary fibroblasts in lung. The response of stellate cells to injury
is termed 'activation' and represents a cellular program with a distinct
temporal sequence involving both up- and downregulation of gene
expression. The methods for isolating and culturing stellate cells are
useful for exploring molecular mechanisms of stellate cell activation.
To broaden the search for transcription factors involved in the
activation process, subtraction hybridization was used to identify
transcripts induced early in rat stellate cells in vivo after a single
dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), a known precipitant of hepatic
fibrosis. In this way cDNA showing homology to zinc finger proteins was
isolated. Ratziu et al. (1998) isolated full-length rat and human cDNAs,
which they termed ZF9, and characterized production of ZF9 protein. They
established that ZF9 is a nuclear DNA-binding protein in activated cells
that, in a context-dependent manner, transactivates a key promoter
driving stellate cell fibrogenesis. The ZF9 nucleotide sequence predicts
that it is a member of the Kruppel-like family with a unique N-terminal
domain rich in serine-proline clusters and leucines. ZF9 binds
specifically to a DNA oligonucleotide containing a GC-box motif. Ratziu
et al. (1998) noted that COPEB/BCD1 is the human homolog of Zf9.

MAPPING

El Rouby et al. (1997) determined the chromosomal assignment of BCD1 by
Southern blot analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids that contain
a single chromosome or several different human chromosomes in one or
more hybrid cell lines. The assignment to chromosome 10 was confirmed
and refined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which
localized the gene to 10p15-p14. By FISH, Onyango et al. (1998) further
refined the map position to 10p15. By the same method, Ratziu et al.
(1998) assigned the ZF9 gene to 10p.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Narla et al. (2001) demonstrated that KLF6 is mutated in a subset of
human prostate cancer. Loss of heterozygosity analysis revealed that 1
KLF6 allele is deleted in 77% (17 of 22) of primary prostate tumors.
Sequence analysis of the retained KLF6 allele revealed mutations in 71%
of these tumors. Functional studies confirmed that whereas wildtype KLF6
upregulates p21 (WAF1/CIP1; 116899) in a p53-independent manner and
significantly reduces cell proliferation, tumor-derived KLF6 mutants do
not. Furthermore, Narla et al. (2001) demonstrated that separate
malignant foci within prostate cancers from the same patient contained
different KLF6 mutations. Narla et al. (2001) observed that 18 of 33
prostate tumors had KLF6 mutations. Of the 26 mutations identified, 23
were within the KLF6 transactivation domain. These mutations resulted in
25 nonconservative amino acid changes and the introduction of a
premature stop codon. None of these mutations was present in the
patient's normal prostate tissue DNA or in germline DNA from 100
chromosomes of 50 unaffected, unrelated individuals. The majority of the
mutations affected highly conserved amino acids, suggesting that these
residues are functionally important.

In a set of 80 sporadic gastric cancers, Cho et al. (2005) identified 4
missense mutations in exon 2 of the KLF6 gene (see, e.g., 602053.0006);
the mutations were absent from corresponding normal tissue, suggesting
somatic mutation. In addition, 16 (43.2%) of 37 informative cases showed
allelic loss at the KLF6 locus. All of the cases with mutation and 13 of
the 16 with allelic loss were of advanced intestinal-type gastric cancer
with lymph node metastasis.

DESCRIPTION The serotonin 1D receptor was initially characterized by radioligand
binding procedures using membranes derived from bovine caudate nucleus.
The 5-HT-1D receptor is known to be a G protein-coupled receptor.
Sumatriptan, an agent effective in the treatment of acute migraine, is
the only ligand yet identified that is selective for the 5-HT-1D
receptor. Weinshank et al. (1992) reported the cloning, deduced amino
acid sequences, pharmacologic properties, and second-messenger coupling
of a pair of human 5-HT-1D receptor genes, which they designated alpha
and beta due to their strong similarities. Both genes have no introns in
their coding regions, are expressed in the human cerebral cortex, and
can couple to inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Their
pharmacologic binding properties match closely those of human, bovine,
and guinea pig 5-HT-1D sites. Libert et al. (1991) obtained cDNA clones
encoding 4 receptors of the G protein-coupled receptor family by
selective amplification and cloning from thyroid cDNA. One of these
clones, termed RDC4 by them, showed close structural similarity with the
serotonin 5HT1A receptor (109760). By in situ hybridization, they
demonstrated that the gene (HTR1D) is located on chromosome 1 at
1p36.3-p34.3. By Southern blot analysis of a hybrid cell panel, Jin et
al. (1992) showed that the HTR1D gene is located on chromosome 1. Wilkie
et al. (1993) showed that the homologous gene in the mouse is located on
chromosome 4.

610257	TITLE *610257 SEC31, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, A; SEC31A
;;SEC31-LIKE 1; SEC31L1;;
KIAA0905
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEC31A is a subunit of coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles,
which are essential for secretion (Jin et al., 2012).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned SEC31L1, which they designated
KIAA0905. The deduced protein contains 1,220 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected moderate expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
brain regions examined.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to yeast Sec31,
followed by screening a pancreas cDNA library, Tang et al. (2000) cloned
SEC31L1, which they called SEC31A. The deduced 1,218-amino acid protein
shares 25.8% identity with yeast Sec31. It contains 5 WD40 or WD40-like
repeats at its N terminus and a proline-rich region in its C-terminal
half. Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb transcript that was
abundantly and ubiquitously expressed. In rat kidney cells, Sec31a
colocalized with Sec13 (SEC13L1; 600152) in vesicular-tubular structures
characteristic of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunostaining for Sec31a in intact and permeabilized rat kidney
cells, Tang et al. (2000) found that Sec31a was not tightly associated
with the membrane. Binding of Sec31a to specific membrane structures was
restored by incubating washed cells with cytosol, indicating that Sec31a
was recruited to membranes. The membrane association of Sec31a was
greatly enhanced in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. Tang
et al. (2000) demonstrated that Sec31A and Sec13 coimmunoprecipitated
and that the proteins existed in a 600- to 700-kD complex.
Immunodepletion studies showed that rat Sec31a was required for
ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport.

Jin et al. (2012) found that monoubiquitination of Sec31 in mouse
embryonic stem cells by Klhl12 (614522) and the Cul3 (603136) E3
ubiquitin ligase complex was required for COPII vesicle expansion to
accommodate large cargo proteins, such as procollagens (see 120150). A
Sec31-binding mutant of Klhl12 neither colocalized with Sec31 at
intracellular vesicles nor induced formation of large vesicles.
Disruption of KLHL12-CUL3 function in human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells
impaired COPII vesicle expansion and collagen export, but it had no
effect on export of smaller cargo by small COPII vesicles. Jin et al.
(2012) concluded that KLHL12-CUL3 monoubiquitination of SEC31 is
required for COPII vesicle expansion to accommodate large or bulky cargo
molecules.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the SEC31L1
gene to chromosome 4.

611973	TITLE *611973 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S6; MRPS6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS6 is 1 of more
than 70 protein components of mitochondrial ribosomes that are encoded
by the nuclear genome (Kenmochi et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS6. The deduced 125-amino acid MRPS6 protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 14.2 kD. Koc et al. (2001) identified MRPS6
orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, yeast, and E. coli. Highest
conservation is in the N-terminal end and central region of MRPS6
orthologs. Mouse and human MRPS6 share 84.8% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of an integrated BAC-STS map,
Kenmochi et al. (2001) mapped the MRPS6 gene to chromosome
21q21.3-q22.1.

606599	TITLE *606599 THIOREDOXIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN; TXNIP
;;VITAMIN D3-UPREGULATED PROTEIN 1; VDUP1;;
THIOREDOXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Exposure to vitamin D3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) or phorbol ester
induces the bipotent HL-60 cell promyelocytic leukemia cell line to
differentiate into monocytes/macrophages, whereas retinoic acid and
dimethylsulfoxide induce differentiation towards granulocytes. The
differentiation is accompanied by regulation of MYC (190080), FOS
(164810), FMS (CSF1R; 164770), and myeloblastin (PRTN3; 177020). By
differential screening of HL60 cell lines, Chen and DeLuca (1994)
identified a cDNA encoding TXNIP, which they termed VDUP1. The deduced
TXNIP protein has 391 amino acids. Ribonuclease protection analysis
showed dramatically increased expression of TXNIP in response to vitamin
D3 but not to phorbol ester. Chen and DeLuca (1994) concluded that TXNIP
is not involved in the differentiation process.

Junn et al. (2000) cloned mouse Vdup1. The deduced 395-amino acid
protein shares 94% identity with human VDUP1. Northern blot analysis
detected expression of Vdup1 in all tissues examined. Expression was
relatively low in brain and liver. Transient transfected HeLa cells
expressed Vdup1 in the cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Junn et al. (2000) found that the C-terminal half of mouse Vdup1
interacted with the redox-active center of thioredoxin (TRX, or TXN;
187700). Mutation of 2 critical cysteines in the Trx active center
abrogated the interaction with Vdup1. Transfection of mouse Vdup1 into
human embryonic kidney cells reduced the endogenous reducing activity of
TRX or the activity of cotransfected TRX. Overexpression of Vdup1
inhibited interaction between Trx and a thiol-specific antioxidant, Pag
(PRDX1; 176763), and it inhibited interaction between Trx and Ask1.
Treatment of mouse fibroblasts and T-cell hybridoma cells with various
stress stimuli, such as hydrogen peroxide or heat shock, induced Vdup1
expression. Exposure of mouse fibroblasts overexpressing Vdup1 to stress
resulted in reduced cell proliferation and elevated apoptotic cell
death. Junn et al. (2000) concluded that VDUP1 functions as an oxidative
stress mediator by inhibiting TRX activity.

Wang et al. (2002) found that biomechanical strain or hydrogen peroxide
downregulated expression of Vdup1, but not Trx, in rat cardiomyocytes.
The rapid response occurred through transcriptional control and led to
increased Trx activity. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Vdup1
suppressed Trx activity and induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
Furthermore, Vdup1 overexpression sensitized cells to hydrogen
peroxide-induced apoptosis, whereas Trx overexpression protected cells
against injury. Wang et al. (2002) concluded that VDUP1 is a key
stress-responsive inhibitor of thioredoxin activity in cardiomyocytes.

Yoshioka et al. (2004) overexpressed TXN in rat cardiomyocytes and
observed the induction of protein synthesis; overexpression of TXNIP
reduced protein synthesis in response to mechanical strain,
phenylephrine, and angiotensin II (see 106150). In vivo, myocardial TXN
activity increased 3.5-fold compared to sham controls after transverse
aortic constriction; however, aortic constriction did not increase TXN
expression but reduced TXNIP expression by 40%. Gene transfer studies
revealed that cells overexpressing TXNIP developed less hypertrophy
after aortic constriction than control cells in the same animals.
Yoshioka et al. (2004) concluded that TXN has a dual function as both an
antioxidant and a signaling protein involved in the development of
pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy, and suggested that TXNIP is a
critical regulator of biomechanical signaling.

Tissing et al. (2007) found that 8 hours of prednisolone treatment
altered expression of 51 genes in leukemic cells from children with
precursor-B- or T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared with nonexposed
cells. The 3 most highly upregulated genes were FKBP5 (602623), ZBTB16
(176797), and TXNIP, which were upregulated 35.4-, 8.8-, and 3.7-fold,
respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ludwig et al. (2001) determined that the mouse Txnip gene contains 8
exons and spans 2.3 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TXNIP
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP WI-8000).

Using FISH, Ludwig et al. (2001) mapped the mouse Txnip gene to
chromosome 3 in a region showing homology of synteny to human chromosome
1q21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL; 144250) is a common,
multifactorial and heterogeneous dyslipidemia predisposing to premature
coronary artery disease and characterized by elevated plasma
triglycerides, cholesterol, or both. Castellani et al. (1998) identified
a mouse mutant strain, HcB-19, that shares features with FCHL, including
hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, elevated plasma
apolipoprotein B, and increased secretion of triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins. This disorder was shown to result from spontaneous
mutation at a locus, designated Hyplip1 (602491), on distal mouse
chromosome 3 in a region syntenic to 1q21-q23, where a locus for FCHL
was identified in Finnish, German, Chinese, and U.S. families. By
positional cloning, Bodnar et al. (2002) demonstrated that the mouse
Hyplip1 gene is Txnip, and they demonstrated a Txnip nonsense mutation
in the HcB-19 strain that was absent in its normolipidemic parental
strains. The causative mutation was found to be a T-to-A transversion at
position 337 in the 1,456-bp cDNA. This spontaneous mutation changed a
tyrosine (TAT) to a stop codon (TAA) at amino acid 97; the protein
normally consists of 395 amino acid residues. Txnip encodes a
cytoplasmic protein that binds and inhibits thioredoxin, a major
regulator of cellular redox state. The mutant mice had decreased CO(2)
production but increased ketone body synthesis, suggesting that altered
redox status downregulates the citric acid cycle, sparing fatty acids
for triglyceride and ketone body production. Castellani et al. (1998)
suggested further studies to elucidate the potential role of the human
homolog in FCHL and other metabolic disorders. Although hyperlipidemia
in mice is associated with mutation in the Txnip gene, the human
disorder is associated with the USF1 gene (191523).

Sheth et al. (2005) created Txnip-deficient mice on a variety of genetic
backgrounds. Homozygous mutant mice were similar in weight and activity
to wildtype or heterozygous littermates, and there were no differences
in food consumption. However, Txnip-deficient mice in the fed state
exhibited a metabolic profile similar to fasted mice, with increased
plasma ketone bodies and free fatty acids, decreased glucose, and
increased expression of metabolic enzymes in liver and other tissues.
Txnip-deficient mice also showed an altered redox status, with a
significantly increased ratio of NADH to NAD+. The fat-to-muscle ratio
of Txnip-deficient mice was increased by about 40%, primarily due to
decreased muscle mass. Txnip deficiency did not result in significantly
increased liver thioredoxin activity in either the fasted or fed states.
Some Txnip-deficient mice developed liver adenomas and carcinomas at
about 9 months of age.

By comparing Txnip-null mice with mice lacking Txnip specifically in
muscle or liver, Hui et al. (2008) determined that deficiency of Txnip
in skeletal muscle and heart is responsible for the inability of
Txnip-null mice to modify fuel metabolism in response to fasting. They
found that Txnip deficiency in skeletal muscle and heart impaired the
ability of thioredoxin NADPH-dependent disulfide reduction to maintain
Pten (601728) in a sufficiently active state to oppose Akt (see AKT1;
164730) signaling. Unopposed, Akt activation in Txnip-deficient skeletal
muscle and heart prevented switching of fuel away from glucose toward
3-hydroxybutyrate and fatty acids, resulting in an inappropriate
metabolic adaptation to food deprivation.

Lee et al. (2005) generated healthy and viable mice lacking Vdup1. Flow
cytometric and functional assays revealed only slight alterations in B-
and T-cell populations, but there was a severe defect in NK-cell
function and development. NK cells from Vdup1 -/- mice showed reduced
Cd122 (IL2RB; 146710) expression and reduced responsiveness to Il15
(600554) in the absence of vitamin D3, suggesting that CD122 expression
is dependent on VDUP1. Vdup1 -/- mice were less able to reject NK
cell-sensitive tumor cells compared with wildtype mice. Lee et al.
(2005) concluded that VDUP1 is necessary for NK-cell growth and
cytotoxic function, and that it is also involved in regulation of
intestinal intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Pall et al. (2004) cloned mouse Mospd3 and identified the human MOSPD3
gene. The deduced 235-amino acid MOSPD3 protein contains an N-terminal
major sperm protein domain and 2 transmembrane domains.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Pall et al. (2004) mapped the MOSPD3 gene
to chromosome 7q22. They mapped the mouse Mospd3 gene to a region of
chromosome 5 that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome 7q22.

ANIMAL MODEL

phenotypic defect was dependent on the genetic background, indicating
the presence of modifier loci.

HIV-1 INDUCER OF SHORT TRANSCRIPTS-BINDING FACTOR 1;;
HIV-1 IST-BINDING FACTOR 1; FBI1;;
LEUKEMIA/LYMPHOMA-RELATED FACTOR; LRF;;
POKEMON
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

BTB/POZ domains can form homomeric or heterodimeric complexes and are
found in some viral and cellular proteins that may not be associated
with transcription. By screening mouse embryo cDNA libraries using
RT-PCR with degenerate primers to detect cDNAs encoding BTB/POZ
domain-containing proteins, followed by screening a mouse heart cDNA
library and a human genomic library, Davies et al. (1999) obtained cDNAs
encoding mouse and human LRF (leukemia/lymphoma-related factor). The
mouse and human LRF proteins share 88% amino acid identity. Northern
blot analysis revealed wide expression of 3 transcripts in various cell
lines as well as in skin, lung, and liver, but not in spleen or thymus.
Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis showed expression of Lrf in
the first 2 pharyngeal arches, limb buds, tail buds, and the neural tube
of mouse embryos, suggesting a role in stimulating cell proliferation.

By biochemical purification, micropeptide sequence analysis, EST
database searching, and screening a human embryonic carcinoma cDNA
library, Morrison et al. (1999) independently isolated a cDNA encoding
LRF, which they called FBI1 for 'factor that binds to IST,' the HIV-1
inducer of short transcripts. Sequence analysis predicted that the
584-amino acid protein contains 4 C-terminal Kruppel-type zinc fingers,
a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and an N-terminal POZ domain.
Northern blot analysis detected expression in peripheral blood
leukocytes, colon, small intestine, and ovary. SDS-PAGE and Western blot
analysis showed that FBI1 is expressed as an 86-kD protein, which is
significantly higher than its calculated molecular mass of 61.5 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

PLZF (176797) and BCL6 (109565) are BTB/POZ domain-containing zinc
finger proteins implicated in oncogenesis as well as in myelopoiesis and
lymphopoiesis, respectively. By coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid
analyses, Davies et al. (1999) found that LRF interacted with BCL6 but
not with PLZF. The interaction required both the BTB/POZ and zinc finger
domains of the 2 proteins. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of LRF and BCL6 in the nucleus.

By EMSA and supershift analysis, Morrison et al. (1999) determined that
the first 2 zinc fingers of FBI1 associated with the HIV-1 IST element
and with wildtype Tat. In addition, they found that FBI1 self-associated
through its POZ domain in vitro and in vivo and through its zinc finger
domains in vivo only.

Maeda et al. (2005) identified the transcriptional repressor FBI1, which
they called Pokemon (POK erythroid myeloid ontogenic factor), as a
critical factor in oncogenesis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking
Zbtb7 were completely refractory to oncogene-mediated cellular
transformation. Conversely, FBI1 overexpression led to overt oncogenic
transformation both in vitro and in vivo in transgenic mice. FBI1 can
specifically repress the transcription of the tumor suppressor gene ARF
(600160) through direct binding. Maeda et al. (2005) found that FBI1 is
aberrantly overexpressed in human cancers, and its expression levels
predict biologic behavior and clinical outcome.

MAPPING

Davies et al. (1999) mapped the LRF gene to 19p13.3 by FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Maeda et al. (2007) found that Lrf -/- mice exhibited embryonic
lethality at 16.5 days postcoitum due to severe anemia, which was
preceded by reduced numbers of fetal liver B lymphocytes after the pro-B
stage of differentiation. In contrast, T-cell levels in mice with a
conditionally deleted Lrf gene were comparable to those in control mice,
but polyclonal extrathymic Cd4/Cd8 double-positive cells accumulated in
the marrow. Treatment of Lrf conditional knockout mice with a
gamma-secretase inhibitor, which also inhibits Notch (see 190198)
signaling, rescued abnormal B- and T-cell commitment and led to
resumption of Vpreb1 (605141) expression. Maeda et al. (2007) concluded
that LRF acts as a master regulator in determination of B versus T
lymphoid fate by negatively regulating T-lineage commitment by opposing
NOTCH function. Thus, loss of LRF results in aberrant activation of the
NOTCH pathway, with upregulation of NOTCH target genes in hemopoietic
stem cells and common lymphoid progenitors.

611574	TITLE *611574 SPHINGOMYELIN SYNTHASE 2; SGMS2
;;SMS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sphingomyelin (SM) is a major component of plasma membranes. It is
preferentially concentrated in the outer leaflet and has a role in the
formation of lipid rafts. SM synthases (EC 2.7.8.27), such as SGMS2,
produce SM in the lumen of the Golgi and on the cell surface through the
transfer of phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine onto ceramide,
yielding diacylglycerol as a side product (Huitema et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences encoding motifs characteristic of
SM synthases, Huitema et al. (2004) identified SGMS2, which they called
SMS2. The deduced 366-amino acid protein contains 5 membrane-spanning
alpha helices connected by hydrophilic extramembrane loops as well as 4
highly conserved motifs, designated D1 to D4. Protease protection
analysis of transfected HeLa cells revealed that the C terminus was
cytosolic, indicating that the putative active site residues are in the
extracellular space. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a
1.9-kb transcript in brain, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, and stomach.
SGMS2 localized primarily to the plasma membrane as well as to the Golgi
apparatus.

GENE FUNCTION

By heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae, Huitema et al. (2004)
showed that human SGMS2 formed SM in the presence of choline and
ceramide. Both phosphatidylcholine and SM itself were utilized as
phosphorylcholine group donors, but lysophosphatidylcholine was a very
poor substrate, and other donors, including other phospholipids, did not
support SM formation. Huitema et al. (2004) concluded that SGMS2
requires 2 fatty chains on the phosphocholine donor molecule for it to
be utilized as a substrate. SGMS2 could also catalyze the reverse
reaction.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SGMS2
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP STS-H01973).

607170	TITLE *607170 CYSTEINE-RICH PROTEIN WITH EGF-LIKE DOMAINS 1; CRELD1
;;CIRRIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-like repeats are a class of
cysteine-rich domains that mediate interactions between proteins of
diverse function. EGF domains are found in proteins that are either
completely secreted or have transmembrane regions that tether the
protein to the cell surface. CRELD1 is the founding member of a family
of matricellular proteins.

CLONING

By screening EST clones mapped to chromosome 3p25-p24.2, Rupp et al.
(2002) identified CRELD1, which shows sequence similarity to
extracellular matrix proteins. The full-length clone encodes a deduced
420-amino acid protein. Structural analysis suggested that CRELD1 is a
cell adhesion molecule that contains an N-terminal signal sequence; 2
type III transmembrane domains separated by a short cytoplasmic loop; a
tandem array of EGF-like repeats; and a region rich in glutamate and
tryptophan residues (WE domain). It also has 2 putative N-linked
glycosylation sites and several possible serine, threonine, and tyrosine
phosphorylation sites. Utilization of an alternative exon 9 (exon 9b
within intron 9) results in a protein with a unique C terminus that has
no predicted transmembrane domain. Rupp et al. (2002) also cloned the
cow and mouse orthologs of CRELD1, which share 94% and 92% amino acid
identity with human CRELD1, respectively. Database analysis revealed
that the CRELD1 gene is highly conserved across species, including
Drosophila and C. elegans.

Using Northern blot analysis, Rupp et al. (2002) detected ubiquitous
expression of a major 2.1-kb CRELD1 transcript, with highest expression
in fetal lung, liver, and kidney, and in adult heart, brain, and
skeletal muscle. Adult brain also showed an alternative transcript of
2.5 kb, and several heart regions showed an additional transcript of 2.3
kb. By Northern array analysis, Rupp et al. (2002) determined that the
variant that utilizes exon 9b is expressed in adult brain, thymus, lymph
node, and several areas of the gastrointestinal tract, and in fetal
spleen, thymus, and lung. In situ hybridization in developing chick
embryos revealed expression of Creld1 at all time points and localized
high levels of expression in the developing heart, limb buds, mandible,
branchial arches, and brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rupp et al. (2002) determined that the CRELD1 gene contains 11 exons
spanning approximately 12 kb. The major 2.1-kb transcript utilizes exons
1 through 10. There are repetitive elements (SINE and LINE class) in
introns 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9 and a simple hexanucleotide repeat in intron
6.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and analysis of a BAC contig, Rupp et al.
(2002) mapped the CRELD1 gene to chromosome 3p25.3. Radiation hybrid
analysis localized the mouse Creld1 gene to distal chromosome 6, which
shows homology of synteny with human chromosome 3p25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rupp et al. (2002) noted that the CRELD1 gene is in a region of loss of
heterozygosity for several types of cancer.

In a patient with an isolated atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD2;
606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified an arg329-to-cys mutation
(R329C; 607170.0001) in the CRELD1 gene, which was present but not
expressed in the proband's father, brother, or sister. These findings
were consistent with previous observations of incomplete penetrance in
AVSD (Pierpont et al., 2000). Given the low penetrance observed in this
family, Robinson et al. (2003) proposed that CRELD1 is an AVSD
susceptibility gene and that CRELD1 mutations increase the risk of
developing a heart defect, rather than being directly causative. In 2
other patients, Robinson et al. (2003) identified thr311-to-ile (T311I;
607170.0002) and arg107-to-his (R107H; 607170.0003) mutations,
respectively.

Among 49 patients with AVSD, Zatyka et al. (2005) identified 5 novel
sequence variants in the CRELD1 gene. Three of the novel variants were
also identified in normal controls, 1 was a silent change, and 1 was
also seen in 2 family members without congenital heart disease
(607170.0004). Genetic analysis of 12 patients with 3p- syndrome
(613792) showed that the CRELD1 gene was deleted in all 5 patients with
an AVSD but was also deleted in 4 patients without congenital heart
disease. Zatyka et al. (2005) concluded that CRELD1 deletions are
unlikely to account for AVSD in children with 3p deletions but that rare
missense mutations may confer susceptibility to AVSD in a subset of
patients.

Because trisomy 21 (190685) is by far the most common finding associated
with AVSD, Maslen et al. (2006) analyzed the CRELD1 gene in 39
individuals with Down syndrome and complete AVSD. They identified
heterozygosity for missense mutations in 2 infants (607170.0001 and
607170.0005, respectively), and suggested that defects in CRELD1 may
contribute to the pathogenesis of AVSD in the context of trisomy 21.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, ARG329CYS

In an individual with an isolated partial atrioventricular septal defect
(606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 4201C-T
transition in exon 9 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in an arg329-to-cys
(R329C) substitution in the second cb-EGF domain. The addition of a free
cysteine residue to a cb-EGF domain disrupted its disulfide bonding
pattern. The mutation was inherited from the father who, like a brother
and sister of the proband who also carried the mutation, did not report
having a heart defect. Special studies likewise showed structurally
normal hearts. These findings were consistent with previous observations
of incomplete penetrance in AVSD (Pierpont et al., 2000).

In an infant with Down syndrome (190685) and complete atrioventricular
septal defect, Maslen et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for the
R329C mutation. The infant also had patent ductus arteriosus, tricuspid
regurgitation, anomalous hepatic drainage to the right atrium, and
pulmonary hypertension. The mutation was inherited from the mother, a
normal euploid individual with no evidence of a heart defect. The
mutation was not found in 30 individuals with Down syndrome and no heart
defect by echocardiography.

Ackerman et al. (2012) identified this mutation in 2 individuals with
Down syndrome and atrioventricular septal defect. The mutation was not
seen in 141 controls who had Down syndrome but no AVSD.

ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, THR311ILE

In an individual with an isolated partial atrioventricular septal defect
(606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 4148C-T
transition in exon 9 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in a thr311-to-ile
(T311I) mutation in the second cb-EGF domain.

.0003
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, PARTIAL, WITH HETEROTAXY SYNDROME

In a patient of mixed Hispanic and African American descent with partial
atrioventricular septal defect and features of heterotaxy syndrome
(dextrocardia, right ventricle aorta with pulmonary atresia, and right
aortic arch) (see 606217), Robinson et al. (2003) identified a
heterozygous 1566G-A transition in exon 3 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting
in an arg107-to-his (R107H) mutation in the highly conserved WE domain
of the gene. No extracardiac abnormalities were detected.

.0004
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, PRO162ALA

In a patient with sporadic partial atrioventricular septal defect
(600309) and a 47,XXX karyotype, Zatyka et al. (2005) identified a
484C-G transversion in exon 5 of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in a
pro162-to-ala (P162A) substitution. The mutation was not identified in
200 control chromosomes but was found in the patient's mother and
maternal grandmother, neither of whom had congenital heart disease.
Zatyka et al. (2005) suggested that the P162A mutation, if causative,
showed reduced penetrance.

.0005
ATRIOVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 2
CRELD1, GLU414LYS

In an infant with Down syndrome (190685) and complete balanced
atrioventricular septal defect and tricuspid regurgitation, Maslen et
al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a 1240G-A transition in exon 10
of the CRELD1 gene, resulting in a glu414-to-lys (E414K) substitution.
The mutation was not found in either parent, in 400 race-relevant
chromosomes, or in 30 individuals with Down syndrome and no heart defect
by echocardiography.

Ackerman et al. (2012) identified this mutation in 1 patient with Down
syndrome and AVSD; it was not identified in 141 individuals with Down
syndrome and no congenital heart defect.

602479	TITLE *602479 POU DOMAIN, CLASS 3, TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1; POU3F1
;;OCT6;;
SCIP
DESCRIPTION The vertebrate class III POU transcription factors consist of 4 members:
POU3F1 (Oct6), POU3F2 (600494), POU3F3 (Brain-1), and POU3F4 (Brain-4;
300039). The chromosomal locations of the murine class III POU genes
were determined by interspecific backcross analysis (Avraham et al.,
1993; Xia et al., 1993). On the basis of mouse-human chromosomal
homologies, human POU3F1 and POU3F3 were expected to map to 1p and 2q,
respectively. Sumiyama et al. (1998) found that the location of POU3F1
was consistent with this position, mapping to 1p34.1 by FISH. Contrary
to the prediction, however, POU3F3 was mapped to 3p14.2 by the same
method. The human POU3F2 and POU3F4 genes map to 6q16 and Xq21.1,
respectively. Thus, the 4 human class III POU genes map to different
chromosomes. A phylogenetic tree of these 4 genes shows that they
emerged in a common ancestor of vertebrates. Studies of the genome
structure of vertebrates suggest that genome duplication occurred at
least twice in the early stage of vertebrate evolution; 4 homologous
complexes such as Hox and MHC are interspersed in the mammalian genome.
The findings with the 4 class III POU genes are consistent with the idea
of 2 genome duplications.

Xia et al. (1993) mapped the mouse homolog of the POU3F1 gene, called
Tst1 by them, to chromosome 4.

Most mice homozygous for a mutant Pou3f1 die soon after birth
(Bermingham et al., 1996; Jaegle et al., 1996). Bermingham et al. (1996)
and Jaegle et al. (1996) showed that sciatic nerves of Oct6 -/- mice
showed a delay in Schwann cell differentiation, with a transient arrest
at the promyelination stage before axonal wrapping, suggesting that Oct6
is required for the transition of promyelin cells to myelinating cells.
Arroyo et al. (1998) confirmed these findings and used
beta-galactosidase expression to show that promyelinating Schwann cells
expressed the highest levels of Oct6, both in developing and
regenerating nerves.

In rat sciatic nerves, Nickols et al. (2003) found that expression of
the activated p65 subunit (164014) of the transcription factor NFKB was
high in the nuclei of premyelinating Schwann cells and then
progressively declined until it was nearly absent in adults. NFKB
expression preceded and was necessary for the upregulation of Oct6. The
authors concluded that NFKB is upstream of Oct6 induction and is also
required for the formation of peripheral myelin.

Ghazvini et al. (2002) created mice with a Schwann cell-specific
deficiency in Oct6 expression. Mice homozygous for this deficiency were
viable but showed a delay in peripheral nerve development. In the
absence of Oct6, Krox20 (129010) expression was delayed but was
eventually activated at the time of extensive myelination. Sciatic nerve
regeneration following crush lesion was also delayed in the absence of
Oct6 gene function.

The transient nature of the Schwann cell defect in Oct6-deficient mice
observed by Ghazvini et al. (2002) suggested some redundancy in
transcription factor function during Schwann cell development. In
sciatic nerve extracts from chick embryos, young chicks, and mice,
Jaegle et al. (2003) showed that the POU transcription factor Brn2
(POU3F2; 600494) is expressed and regulated in developing Schwann cells
in a manner similar to that of Oct6, and that Brn2 gene activation does
not depend on Oct6. Overexpression of Brn2 in Oct6-deficient Schwann
cells of mice showed partial rescue of peripheral nerve developmental
delay with an increase in the number of actively myelinating Schwann
cells, suggesting that Brn2 can functionally substitute for Oct6 in
promoting the transition from promyelinating to myelinating Schwann
cells. Compound disruption of both Oct6 and Brn2 resulted in a much more
severe phenotype with abnormal nerve morphology. Jaegle et al. (2003)
concluded that Brn2 and Oct6 share roles as positive regulators of
Schwann cell development.

612220	TITLE *612220 BETA-1,4-N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 3; B4GALNT3
;;B4GalNAcT3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

B4GALNT3 transfers N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) onto glucosyl residues
to form N,N-prime-diacetyllactosediamine (LacdiNAc, or LDN), a unique
terminal structure of cell surface N-glycans (Ikehara et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences encoding
beta-1,4-glycosyltransferase (beta-4GT) motifs, followed by 5-prime RACE
and PCR of a human stomach cDNA library, Sato et al. (2003) cloned
B4GALNT3, which they designated B4GalNAcT3. The deduced 999-amino acid
protein has a typical type II topology, with an N-terminal transmembrane
domain, 4 potential N-glycosylation sites, a DXH sequence thought to
participate in divalent cation binding, and a C-terminal WGGED motif
characteristic of beta-4GTs. Sato et al. (2003) also identified mouse
B4galnt3, which encodes a deduced 986-amino acid protein that shares
82.2% identity with human B4GALNT3. RT-PCR of human tissues detected
high B4GALNT3 expression in stomach, colon, and testis, and lower
expression in other tissues. B4GALNT3 was also expressed in colon and
stomach cancer cell lines and some other cell lines.

Using Western blot analysis with reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE,
Ikehara et al. (2006) found that recombinant soluble B4GalNAcT3, lacking
the N-terminal transmembrane domain, was processed into N- and
C-terminal fragments that were coupled through disulfide bonds.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human gastric tissues showed that
B4GalNAcT3 was expressed only in surface mucous cells of pyloric and
fundic glands and in the glandular compartment of fundic glands.
Confocal microscopy showed that B4GalNAcT3 localized specifically to the
trans-Golgi region.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a variety of UDP donors and monosaccharide acceptors, Sato et al.
(2003) found that a soluble form of B4GalNAcT3 expressed in human
embryonic kidney cells transferred GalNAc to N-acetylglucosyl (GlcNAc)
beta-benzyl through a beta-1,4-linkage to form LDN. B4GalNAcT3
transferred GalNAc to all N- and O-glycans examined that contained
GlcNAc at their nonreducing termini. Some glycohormones contain
N,N-prime-LDN structures in their N-glycans. Sato et al. (2003) showed
that B4GalNAcT3 could synthesize this structure using modified fetal
calf fetuin as a model protein substrate.

Using fluorescence-labeled plant lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutinin
(WFA), which binds to terminal GalNAc residues of N-glycans, and an
anti-B4GalNAcT3 monoclonal antibody, Ikehara et al. (2006) showed that
LDN and B4GalNAcT3 localized to the same human gastric mucous cells,
with LDN appearing on the cell surface and B4GalNAcT3 in the apical side
of the nucleus in association with the trans-Golgi network.

Using real-time RT-PCR, Huang et al. (2007) found that expression of
B4GalNAcT3 was upregulated in 29 (72.5%) of 40 primary colon tumors
compared with normal colon tissue. B4GalNAcT3 overexpression in a human
colon cancer cell line enhanced cell-extracellular matrix adhesion,
migration, anchorage-independent growth, and invasion. B4GalNAcT3
overexpression increased tumor growth and metastasis and decreased
survival of tumor-bearing nude mice. The increase in malignant
phenotypes was associated with activation of focal adhesion kinase
(PTK2; 600758) and ERK/MAPK signaling. Huang et al. (2007) concluded
that upregulation of B4GalNAcT3 may contribute to the malignant behavior
of colon cancer cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sato et al. (2003) determined that the B4GALNT3 gene contains at least
20 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sato et al. (2003) mapped the B4GALNT3
gene to chromosome 12p13.3.

610400	TITLE *610400 MACRO DOMAIN-CONTAINING 1; MACROD1
;;LRP16 PROTEIN; LRP16
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By restriction landmark genomic analysis of human lymphocytes, followed
by PCR and RACE, Han et al. (2001) cloned MACROD1, which they called
LRP16. Zhao et al. (2005) noted that LRP16 encodes a 325-amino acid
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhao et al. (2005) reported that ectopic expression of LRP16 stimulated
proliferation of MCF7 breast cancer cells. LRP16 expression was
stimulated by 17-beta-estradiol (E2), and a 2.6-kb fragment upstream of
the translation start site of LRP16 contains ESR1 (133430)
responsiveness. Using 5-prime deletion constructs in MCF7 and HeLa
cells, Zhao et al. (2005) showed that the LRP16 proximal region of -251
to -214 bp contributed to E2-induced transactivation, via an
estrogen-responsive element half-site and an SP1 (189906) binding site.
Gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that
ESR1 and SP1 bound directly to DNA and were required for E2-induced
transactivation of LRP16.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MACROD1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP STS-RH38365).

610325	TITLE *610325 NUCLEAR DISTRIBUTION GENE C, A. NIDULANS, HOMOLOG OF; NUDC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NudC was first identified as a regulator of nuclear movement in the
asexual reproductive cycle of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus
nidulans. Human NUDC is a nuclear movement protein that associates with
dynein (see DYNC1H1; 600112) (Aumais et al., 2003).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to A. nidulans NudC,
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a heart cDNA library, Miller et
al. (1999) cloned human NUDC. Northern blot analysis detected NUDC
expression in all tissues examined, with highest levels in heart and
skeletal muscle. However, Western blot analysis showed highest NUDC
protein expression in brain and erythroid cells, with lower expression
in other tissues examined. Immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow
biopsies detected high NUDC levels in early erythroid and myeloid cells,
but little to none in most differentiated cells. Expression was
primarily cytoplasmic, although punctate nuclear staining was also
observed. In cultured human erythroid cells, NUDC mRNA and protein were
highly expressed in rapidly proliferating cells and declined upon
terminal differentiation.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to mouse and rat NudC
Matsumoto and Ledbetter (1999) identified human NUDC. The deduced
331-amino acid protein contains a basic stretch from lys68 to arg76, an
acidic region from asp144 to asp155, and a 94-amino acid C terminus that
is highly homologous to A. nidulans NudC. Human NUDC shares 94% and 95%
amino acid identity with mouse and rat NudC, respectively. Northern blot
analysis detected a major 1.6-kb transcript and a minor 2.0-kb
transcript in all adult and fetal human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Miller et al. (1999) found that granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (CSF2; 138960) increased expression of NUDC
mRNA and protein in a human erythroleukemia cell line. NUDC expression
was also significantly enhanced in lysates of bone marrow aspirates from
patients with acute myelogenous and acute lymphoblastic leukemia
compared with normal controls.

Aumais et al. (2003) noted that, in rat T cells, NudC is an early
mitogen-responsive gene and, in synchronized cultures, NudC mRNA
increases during mid-G1 and protein levels double during G2/M. They
found that silencing of NUDC through small interfering RNA or
overexpression of rat NudC inhibited HeLa cell proliferation and led to
an increase in the proportion of multinucleated cells. Complementary
studies in C. elegans embryos demonstrated that cytokinetic furrows
regressed when Nud1, the C. elegans ortholog of NUDC, was silenced by
RNA-mediated interference, resulting in 1-celled embryos containing 2
nuclei. Loss of midzone microtubule organization was observed in both
HeLa cells and C. elegans embryos. Altering NUDC levels in HeLa cells
resulted in mislocalization of PLK1 (602098) from mitotic structures,
including the midbody during cytokinesis. Aumais et al. (2003) concluded
that NUDC is crucial for mitotic progression and completion of
cytokinesis.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, pull-down assays, and immunoprecipitation
analysis, Pan et al. (2005) demonstrated that the extracellular domain
of thrombopoietin receptor (MPL; 159530) bound amino acids 100 to 238 of
NUDC. Immunofluorescence staining of a human megakaryocyte cell line
showed colocalization of NUDC and MPL at all stages of megakaryocyte
development. Substantial colocalization of NUDC with microtubules was
detected around nuclei and elongated microtubular structures, especially
in proplatelet extensions. Pan et al. (2005) also found that NUDC was
secreted by human megakaryocyte cell lines and that Nudc was present in
mouse sera. Administration of human NUDC protein enhanced the number of
circulating platelets in mice.

By mass spectrometry analysis of HeLa cell proteins that
immunoprecipitated with NUDC, Zhu et al. (2010) found that NUDC
interacted with about 130 different proteins, including chaperones,
cytoskeletal proteins, and proteins involved in signal transduction,
trafficking, protein synthesis, nucleic acid management, metabolism, and
proteolysis. Some of these proteins were also HSP90-alpha (HSP90AA1;
140571)-interacting proteins. Zhu et al. (2010) found that NUDC and
HSP90-alpha interacted directly and formed an ATPase-dependent chaperone
complex with LIS1 (PAFAH1B1; 601545). An inactivating mutation in the
p23 (PTGES3; 607061) domain of NUDC or pharmacologic inhibition of
HSP90-alpha resulted in LIS1 destabilization. Zhu et al. (2010)
concluded that NUDC is a protein of diverse functions that acts as a
cochaperone for HSP90-alpha.

GENE STRUCTURE

Matsumoto and Ledbetter (1999) determined that the NUDC gene contains at
least 9 exons and spans about 8 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Matsumoto and Ledbetter (1999) mapped the NUDC gene to
chromosome 1p35-p34. They mapped 2 intronless NUDC pseudogenes, NUDCP1
and NUDCP2, to chromosomes 2q23-q24 and 2q31, respectively.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Demuth et al. (1986) isolated a cDNA clone, designated pHKB3, encoding a
human erythrocyte surface protein band 3-like gene product. Peptide
mapping shows substantial sequence homology between the erythrocyte band
3 protein (109270) and a band 3-like protein found in leukocytes.
Palumbo et al. (1986) described the partial sequence of a 2.7-kb human
cDNA clone encoding a band 3-related protein in nonerythroid cells.
Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence for this cDNA with the
amino acid sequences of mouse and human erythroid band 3 proteins
confirmed that the human clone is related to but distinct from erythroid
band 3. Palumbo et al. (1986) symbolized the gene as HKB3, in part after
the name of the human cell line studied.

Tanner (1993) referred to this nonerythroid anion exchanger as AE2. The
ability of AE2 to mediate anion transport has been confirmed. Northern
blotting studies showed that the AE2 gene is transcribed in a wide
variety of tissues. In the mouse, Lindsey et al. (1990) found that AE2
is expressed only in choroid plexus, the site of cerebrospinal fluid
production. Kudrycki et al. (1990) found that, in the rat, AE2 is
particularly abundant in the stomach and portions of the
gastrointestinal tract.

GENE STRUCTURE

Medina et al. (1997) determined that the AE2 gene spans approximately 17
kb and consists of 23 exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell genetics and in situ hybridization, Palumbo et al.
(1986) mapped the HKB3 gene to 7q35-q36. Showe et al. (1993) identified
an MboI RFLP in the EPB3L1 gene. White et al. (1994) demonstrated that
the murine AE2 gene is located on chromosome 5. This result was obtained
by analysis of recombinant inbred lines and by interspecific backcross
analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Medina et al. (2003) disrupted the mouse Ae2 gene in a manner that
prevented the expression of 3 Ae2 isoforms normally found in testis.
Male Ae2 -/- mice, but not female Ae2 -/- mice, were infertile.
Histopathologic analysis of mutant testis showed an interruption in
spermiogenesis, with only a few late spermatids and a complete absence
of spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules. The number of apoptotic
bodies was increased in the seminiferous tubules and in the epididymis,
which also showed squamous metaplasia of the epididymal epithelium.

609959	TITLE *609959 MYELOID-ASSOCIATED DIFFERENTIATION MARKER; MYADM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display analysis, Pettersson et al. (2000) identified
mouse myeloid-associated differentiation marker (Myadm) based upon its
varied expression during differentiation of an Il3 (147740)-dependent
myeloid progenitor cell line established from mouse bone marrow. The
deduced protein contains 8 potential transmembrane domains and several
potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis on hematopoietic
cell lines revealed restricted expression of Myadm to cells belonging to
the myeloid lineage. Expression was also seen in mature granulocytes and
macrophages. Tissue analysis showed high expression of Myadm in lung and
more moderate expression in bone marrow and brain. RT-PCR experiments
demonstrated expression of Myadm in multipotent cells
(c-kit+Sca-1+Lin-), erythroid progenitors, and early lymphoid
progenitors.

By database searching with mouse Myadm as query, Cui et al. (2002)
identified human MYADM and cloned a full-length MYADM sequence from a
human bone marrow cDNA library. The deduced 298-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. It contains 7 predicted transmembrane
domains and shows sequence homology with the T-cell differentiation
protein MAL (188860) and plasmolipin (PLMP; 600340). MYADM shares 75.8%
overall sequence identity with mouse Myadm, with highest levels of
conservation seen in the predicted transmembrane regions. Northern blot
analysis detected 3.3- and 2.2-kb MYADM transcripts. Expression of the
longer transcript was seen in all tissues tested except thymus;
expression of the shorter transcript was seen in heart, placenta, lung,
pancreas, testis, and peripheral blood leukocytes and was undetectable
in all other tissues. Semiquantitative PCR assays showed that expression
of MYADM was not only significantly higher in peripheral blood
leukocytes than in bone marrow cells, but was also upregulated in NB4
cells (derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia) that
were treated with the differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA).

GENE FUNCTION

Using antisense Myadm oligonucleotides, Pettersson et al. (2000) showed
that downregulation of mouse Myadm expression in pluripotent
hematopoietic progenitor cells inhibited colony formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cui et al. (2002) determined that the MYADM gene contains 3 exons and
spans 7.1 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Cui et al. (2002) mapped the MYADM gene to
chromosome 19q13.33-q13.4.

604661	TITLE *604661 POTASSIUM CHANNEL-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2; KCNIP2
;;KCHIP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the brain and heart, rapidly inactivating (A-type) voltage-gated
potassium (Kv) currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to
control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes. An et al.
(2000) described 3 Kv channel-interacting proteins called KCHIPs that
bind to the cytoplasmic amino termini of Kv4-alpha subunits. See KCHIP1
(604660). The KCHIP2 cDNA encodes a 252-amino acid protein that has a
distinct amino terminus but shares approximately 70% amino acid identity
with KCHIP1 and KCHIP3 throughout a carboxy-terminal 185-amino acid core
domain containing 4 EF-hand-like motifs. Expression of KCHIP2 and Kv4
together reconstituted several features of native A-type currents by
modulating the density, inactivation kinetics, and rate of recovery from
inactivation of Kv4 channels in heterologous cells. The KCHIPs
colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with brain Kv4-alpha subunits and
are thus integral components of native Kv4 channel complexes.

GENE FUNCTION

Jeyaraj et al. (2012) provided molecular evidence that links circadian
rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice.
Specifically, they showed that cardiac ion channel expression and QT
interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit
endogenous circadian rhythmicity under the control of a clock-dependent
oscillator, Kruppel-like factor-15 (KLF15; 606465). Klf15
transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of KChIP2, a critical
subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current.
Deficiency or excess of Klf15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation,
abnormal repolarization, and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular
arrhythmias. Jeyaraj et al. (2012) concluded that their findings
identified circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for
cardiac arrhythmogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kuo et al. (2001) found that knockout mice deficient for Kchip2
exhibited normal cardiac structure and function but displayed a
prolonged elevation in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. The
Kchip2 -/- mice were highly susceptible to the induction of cardiac
arrhythmias. Single-cell analysis revealed a substrate for
arrhythmogenesis, including a complete absence of transient outward
potassium current (I-to) and a marked increase in action potential
duration. These studies demonstrated that a defect in KCHIP2 is
sufficient to confer a marked genetic susceptibility to arrhythmias,
establishing a novel genetic pathway for ventricular tachycardia via a
loss of the transmural gradient of I-to.

614984	TITLE *614984 DEHYDROGENASE E1 AND TRANSKETOLASE DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; DHTKD1
;;KIAA1630
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned DHTKD1, which they designated
KIAA1630. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in its
3-prime end. The deduced 901-amino acid DHTKD1 protein shares
significant similarity with Arabidopsis thaliana 2-oxoglutarate
dehydrogenase E1 subunit-like protein. RT-PCR ELISA detected variable
DHTKD1 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with highest
expression in adult kidney, ovary, and brain and all specific adult
brain regions examined. Lowest expression was in adult skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human-rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the
DHTKD1 gene to chromosome 10.

Hartz (2012) mapped the DHTKD1 gene to chromosome 10p14 based on an
alignment of the DHTK1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AA009773) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- 2-Aminoadipic 2-Oxoadipic Aciduria

Danhauser et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygous mutations in
the DHTKD1 gene in patients with 2-aminoadipic 2-oxoadipic aciduria
(204750). Whole-exome sequencing in 1 individual detected compound
heterozygosity for an A-to-G transition altering the methionine at codon
1, which the authors suggested might cause out-of-frame usage of an AUG
triple 160 nucleotides downstream (614984.0001). The second mutation was
a missense mutation, gly729 to arg (G729R; 614984.0002), which affected
an amino acid residue evolutionarily conserved from Homo sapiens to C.
elegans and D. melanogaster. This mutation was found with a minor allele
frequency of 0.17%, corresponding to 19 heterozygous but no homozygous
carriers among 5,379 individuals. The methionine mutation was present in
the mother, but the missense mutation occurred as a de novo event.
Sanger sequencing in the second patient detected the same G729R mutation
as in the first patient, and a nonsense mutation, arg410 to ter (R410X;
614984.0003), on the other allele. Functional assays showed that reduced
DHTKD1 activity was responsible for the 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic
aciduria in the affected individuals. Because of the much milder
phenotype in patients with this disorder than in the disorder glutaric
acidemia I (231670), caused by mutation in the next enzyme in the
pathway, glutaryl CoA-dehydrogenase (608801), the authors suggested that
pharmacologic inhibition of DHTKD1 might be an interesting drug target
for glutaric aciduria type I.

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2Q

Xu et al. (2012) identified a nonsense mutation in the DHTKD1 gene that
segregated with a Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 phenotype (615025)
in a large 5-generation Chinese family from Shandong. Affected
individuals ranged in age from 13 to 71 years of age at the time of
examination. The age of onset of symptomatology ranged from 13 to 25
years of age; all displayed pes cavus. Upper and lower extremity
symptoms appeared to be similar. The proband had distal upper and lower
limb muscle atrophy and some angulated muscle fibers with increased
connective tissue and fat around the muscle bundle and hematoxylin and
eosin staining. Mitochondrial vacuolization was evident on electron
microscopy analysis of muscle cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
2-@AMINOADIPIC 2-OXOADIPIC ACIDURIA
DHTKD1, 1A-G

In a patient with 2-aminoadipic 2-oxoadipic aciduria (204750), Danhauser
et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for mutation in the
DHTKD1 gene, an A-to-G transition affecting the initiating methionine
codon and a nonsense mutation (614984.0002). The 1A-G mutation was
predicted to cause out-of-frame usage of the next AUG triplet 160
nucleotides downstream and thus result in a nonfunctional protein. This
mutation was also identified in the patient's mother.

.0002
2-@AMINOADIPIC 2-OXOADIPIC ACIDURIA
DHTKD1, GLY729ARG (dbSNP rs117225135)

In 2 patients with 2-aminoadipic 2-oxoadipic aciduria (204750),
Danhauser et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 2185 of the DHTHD1 gene resulting in a gly-to-arg
substitution at codon 729 (G729R). In 1 patient the G729R mutation was
found in compound heterozygosity with a mutation involving the initiator
methionine (614984.0001), and in the other patient a premature
termination mutation was found (R410X; 614984.0003). In the first
patient the G729R mutation occurred de novo and in the second it was
maternally transmitted. Gly729 is evolutionarily conserved from Homo
sapiens to C. elegans and D. melanogaster. This mutation (dbSNP
rs117225135) was found in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server with a minor
allele frequency of 0.17%, corresponding to 19 heterozygous but no
homozygous carriers among 5,379 individuals.

.0003
2-@AMINOADIPIC 2-OXOADIPIC ACIDURIA
DHTKD1, ARG410TER

In a patient with 2-aminoadipic 2-oxoadipic aciduria (204750), Danhauser
et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for a missense mutation
in the DHTKD1 gene (G729R; 614984.0002) and a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 1228, resulting in an arg-to-ter substitution at codon 410
(R410X). The patient had mild psychomotor developmental delay but more
significant speech delay, IQ of 87, and muscular hypotonia. The father
was a carrier of the mutation.

.0004
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2Q
DHTKD1, TYR485TER

Xu et al. (2012) reported a 5-generation Chinese family with 8 affected
individuals segregating CMT disease type 2 (CMT2Q; 615025). All 8
affected individuals but no unaffected individuals carried a
heterozygous T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 1455 in exon 8 of the
DHTKD1 gene, resulting in a tyr-to-ter substitution at codon 485
(Y485X). This mutation was not detected in 250 unrelated normal
individuals. The patients were found to have half-normal expression of
DHTKD1 mRNA, and Xu et al. (2012) found that DHTKD1 silencing led to
impaired energy production evidenced by decreased ATP, total NAD(+) and
NADH, and NADH levels in vitro.

CEP164 is a basal body protein required for assembly of the primary

damage response (Sivasubramaniam et al., 2008).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned CEP164, which they designated
KIAA1052. The deduced protein contains 1,455 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected low to moderate CEP164 expression in all adult and fetal
tissues and specific adult brain regions examined, except skeletal
muscle.

Andersen et al. (2003) identified CEP164 as a potential centrosomal
protein in human lymphoblastic KE37 cells. The deduced protein contains
7 coiled-coil domains and a WW motif. Epitope-tagged CEP164 localized to
centrosomes.

Graser et al. (2007) stated that the full-length 1,460-amino acid CEP164
protein contains an N-terminal WW domain followed by 3 coiled-coil
domains. It has a calculated molecular mass of 164 kD. Database analysis
suggested the presence of splice variants. Western blot analysis of
several human cell lines detected CEP164 at an apparent molecular mass
of about 200 kD. Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy
localized CEP164 to the very distally located appendage structure of a
single mature centriole at the base of the primary cilium. Quantitative
RT-PCR and Western blot analyses detected 2-fold elevated CEP164 mRNA
and protein during mitosis, consistent with duplication of centrioles.

Sivasubramaniam et al. (2008) stated that the 1,455- and 1,460-amino
acid isoforms of CEP164 result from differential splicing of exons 9 and
26, respectively. CEP164 contains an N-terminal WW domain, followed by a
long coiled-coil region, part of which shares homology with RAD26
(ERCC6; 609413). CEP164 also has 16 SQ/TQ motifs, which are potential
ATM (607585) and ATR (601215) phosphorylation sites, spread throughout
the molecule. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed localization of
CEP164 at nuclei and centrioles.

GENE FUNCTION

Using small interfering RNA, Graser et al. (2007) found that depletion
of pericentrin (PCNT; 605925), CEP290 (610142), or CEP164 in human
retinal pigment epithelial cells prevented serum starvation-induced
formation of a primary cilium. Knockdown of CEP164 had no effect on
expression of the centriole subappendage proteins ninein (NIN; 608684)
and CEP170 (613023), suggesting that CEP164 does not interact with these
proteins.

Sivasubramaniam et al. (2008) studied the 1,465-amino acid form of
CEP164 and found that it had a critical role in mediating genomic
stability. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that endogenous HeLa
cell CEP164 interacted with the DNA damage response proteins ATR, ATRIP
(606605), ATM, and MDC1 (607593). CEP164 was phosphorylated by ATR and
ATM and accumulated in nuclear foci during ionizing or ultraviolet (UV)
irradiation-induced replication stress in HeLa cells. Ser186 was the
preferred ATM/ATR phosphorylation site. Inactivation of ATM and ATR
reduced CEP164 foci formation upon radiation stress. Knockdown of CEP164
altered phosphorylation of H2AX (H2AFX; 601772), RPA (see 179835), CHK2
(CHEK2; 604373), and CHK1 (CHEK1; 603078) in the DNA damage-induced
checkpoint signaling cascade and abrogated the G2/M checkpoint.

XPA (611153) is an essential factor in the nucleotide excision repair
pathway for removing UV-induced aberrant DNA structures, including
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis, Pan and Lee (2009) found that CEP164 localized to sites of UV
radiation-induced DNA damage in HeLa cells in an XPA-regulated manner.
CEP164 interacted directly with XPA and was recruited to sites of DNA
damage early in the DNA damage response. Interaction of CEP164 with XPA
was required for UV damage-induced CHK1 phosphorylation. Knockdown of
CEP164 sensitized cells to UV irradiation and hampered the removal of
UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Pan and Lee (2009)
hypothesized that, following UV-induced DNA damage, ATR phosphorylates
XPA and CEP164, which serve as critical signals for efficient DNA damage
repair.

Using confocal microscopy, Chaki et al. (2012) found that CEP164
colocalized with the mother centriole, mitotic spindle poles, and the
abscission structure in a cell cycle-dependent manner in immortalized
human retinal pigment epithelial (TERT-RPE) cells. Knockdown of Cep164
in mouse kidney IMCD3 cells permitted normal growth of spheroids in
3-dimensional culture. Cells showed overall normal architecture and
size, but they had markedly reduced frequency of cilia. CEP164
colocalized with the DNA damage response proteins TIP60 (KAT5; 601409)
and SC35 (SRSF2; 600813) and with ZNF423 (604557) and NPHP10 (SDCCAG8;
613524) at nuclear foci in TERT-RPE cells. Following UV
radiation-induced DNA damage in HeLa cells, CEP164 colocalized with
TIP60 and CHK1 in nuclear foci. Knockdown of Cep164 in IMCD3 cells
caused defects in DNA damage response, increased gamma-H2ax intensity,
and increased cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Yeast 2-hybrid,
pull-down, and coimmunoprecipitation analyses also showed that CEP164
interacted directly with CCDC92, TTBK2 (611695), NPHP3 (608002), NPHP2
(INVS; 243305), and DVL3 (601368).

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the CEP164
gene to chromosome 11. Graser et al. (2007) mapped the CEP164 gene to
chromosome 11q23.3 by genomic sequence analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Saudi child, born of consanguineous parents, with a variant of
nephronophthisis-15 (NPHP15; 614845) characterized by Leber congenital
amaurosis and retinal degeneration resulting in blindness by age 2
years, Chaki et al. (2012) identified a homozygous mutation in the
CEP164 gene (614848.0001). Sequencing of this gene in 856 patients with
different NPHP-related ciliopathies identified homozygous or compound
heterozygous mutations in the CEP164 gene in 3 additional families
(614848.0002-614848.0005). Most patients had NPHP and some form of
retinal degeneration, sometimes resulting in blindness. Although the
number of affected families was small, the findings supported a gradient
of genotype/phenotype correlations in which null mutations cause the
severe dysplastic phenotypes of Meckel syndrome and Joubert syndrome,
whereas hypomorphic alleles cause the milder degenerative phenotypes of
NPHP and Senior-Loken syndrome. Cellular studies showed that CEP164 is
involved in the DNA repair response, suggesting that defects in the DNA
repair response signaling pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of
NPHP and related ciliopathies. Chaki et al. (2012) suggested that loss
of function of proteins that have a dual role in centrosome and DNA
repair signaling could cause a disturbance of cell-cycle checkpoint
controls, which is detrimental to progenitor cell survival both during
embryogenesis and later during tissue maintenance.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chaki et al. (2012) found that knockdown of Cep164 in zebrafish resulted
in a ciliopathy with ventral body axis curvature, cell death, abnormal
heart looping, pronephric tubule cysts, hydrocephalus, and retinal
dysplasia.

substitution at a highly conserved residue, and a 1573C-T transition in
exon 13 resulting in a gln525-to-ter (Q525X; 614848.0004) substitution.
Two patients had NPHP at ages 8 and 9 years, respectively, and all had
some degree of retinal degeneration, with 1 child being legally blind at

and obesity. The mutation was found in 1 of 7,019 European American
controls.

607576	TITLE *607576 CAT EYE SYNDROME CHROMOSOME REGION, CANDIDATE 2; CECR2
;;KIAA1740
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult hippocampus
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned CECR2, which they designated
KIAA1740. The deduced protein contains 1,119 amino acids. RT-PCR
followed by ELISA detected moderate expression in all tissues tested
except spleen. In brain, KIAA1740 expression was high in cerebellum,
elevated in hippocampus, and moderate in all other regions tested.

Footz et al. (2001) cloned CECR2 by genomic sequencing of the cat eye
syndrome (115470) critical region of chromosome 22, followed by 5-prime
and 3-prime RACE. The deduced 1,464-amino acid protein contains a
bromodomain.

Using the SEC1 homology domain of LRPPRC (607544) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, Liu and McKeehan (2002) cloned CECR2 from a liver cDNA
library. Northern blot analysis of 12 tissues detected distinct CECR2
banding only in placenta, with transcripts of about 2, 4, 6.5, and 9 kb.
Other tissues showed a smear beginning at about 10 kb, with variable
intensities between tissues. Liu and McKeehan (2002) concluded that the
smearing may indicate particular lability of CECR2 mRNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Footz et al. (2001) determined that the CECR2 gene contains 19 exons and
spans about 186 kb. Intron 1 extends about 106 kb. The mouse Cecr2 gene
has a similar structure.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Footz et al. (2001) mapped the CECR2 gene
within the cat eye syndrome critical region on chromosome 22q11.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Banting et al. (2005) generated a mutant mouse line containing a gene
trap insertion within Cecr2. Cecr2 expression was predominantly neural
in the embryo, and mice homozygous for the Cecr2 gene trap insertion
showed a high penetrance of exencephaly, which is the human equivalent
of anencephaly, in a strain-dependent fashion. In HEK293 cells, they
isolated CECR2 and SMARCA1 (300012) as components of a complex, which
they termed CECR2-containing remodeling factor (CERF). CERF was capable
of remodeling chromatin in vitro and displayed an ATP-hydrolyzing
activity that was stimulated by nucleosomes. Banting et al. (2005)
suggested that CERF plays a critical role in neurulation.

600470	TITLE *600470 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN OF CEREBELLUM 1; ZIC1
;;ZIC FAMILY MEMBER 1;;
ZIC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the mouse, Aruga et al. (1994) cloned a gene, which they named zic
(for zinc finger protein of the cerebellum), after screening a lambda
gt11 mouse cerebellar cDNA library. The putative open reading frame is
1,344 nucleotides encoding 447 amino acids and is preceded by 530
nucleotides of a 5-prime untranslated region. Northern blot
hybridization studies failed to demonstrate zic expression in any
tissues other than nervous tissue. Within the central nervous system,
the highest level of expression was in the cerebellum, whereas the
olfactory bulb, diencephalon, and brainstem showed only low levels of
zic expression. The zic gene has significant homology to the zinc finger
domain of the Caenorhabditis elegans tra1 gene, the Drosophila cubitus
interruptus dominant gene, and the human GLI oncogene (165220). In situ
hybridization demonstrated restricted expression of zic in granule cells
and their putative precursors. It is also expressed in the dorsal half
of the neural tube at early embryonic stages. Aruga et al. (1994)
speculated that zic encodes a nuclear factor involved in differentiation
in early development, as well as in the maintenance of the phenotypic
properties of the cerebellar granule cells.

The ZIC is a zinc finger protein that displays a highly restricted
expression pattern in the adult and developing mouse cerebellum and is
highly homologous to the Drosophila pair-rule gene Opa. To clarify the
mechanism for the development of the human cerebellum and the possible
involvement of ZIC in human nervous system diseases, Yokota et al.
(1996) isolated human ZIC cDNA and examined its expression by using
monoclonal antibody against recombinant ZIC protein. The nucleotide
sequence of human ZIC cDNA is 85% homologous to that the mouse zic gene.
Its putative amino acid sequence is highly conserved (more than 99%)
except for substitution of only 2 amino acid residues. The human ZIC
protein was immunohistochemically detected in the nuclei of the
cerebellar granule cell lineage from the progenitor cells of the
external germinal layer to the postmigrated cells of the internal
granular layer. Furthermore, ZIC protein was detected in medulloblastoma
(26 of 29 cases), whereas none of 70 other tumors examined, including
primitive neuroectodermal tumors, expressed this protein. These findings
suggested that ZIC is a potential biomarker for medulloblastoma as well
as the human cerebellar granule cell lineage.

Using a yeast 1-hybrid screen with the proximal region of the APOE
(107741) promoter as bait, Salero et al. (2001) isolated cDNAs encoding
the ZIC1 and ZIC2 (603073) transcription factors. Electrophoretic
mobility shift and mutational analyses identified binding sites in the
-136 to -125, -65 to -54, and -185 to -174 regions of the APOE promoter.
Luciferase reporter analysis showed that the ZIC proteins stimulate
potent transcriptional activation of APOE through these binding sites.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Yokota et al. (1996) mapped the
human ZIC gene to 3q24.

Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM; 220200) is a common but poorly
understood congenital cerebellar malformation in humans. Through mapping
of 3q2 interstitial deletions in several individuals with DWM, Grinberg
et al. (2004) defined the critical region associated with DWM,
encompassing 2 ZIC genes, ZIC1 and ZIC4 (608948). Mice with a
heterozygous deletion of these 2 linked genes were found to have a
phenotype that closely resembles DWM, providing a mouse model for this
malformation.

;;COPPER METABOLISM MURR1 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5;;
HYPERTENSION-RELATED CALCIUM-REGULATED GENE; HCARG
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Solban et al. (2000) cloned rat Hcarg from a cDNA library constructed
from the spontaneously hypertensive rat parathyroid gland. The deduced
224-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 22.5 kD.
Hcarg has a 67% alpha helix content, a calcium-binding EF-hand motif, 4
putative leucine zipper motifs, a nuclear receptor-binding domain, and
no transmembrane domain. It also contains several putative
phosphorylation sites and an N-glycosylation site. Using rat Hcarg as
probe, Solban et al. (2000) cloned human HCARG from a vascular smooth
muscle cell cDNA library. The deduced 224-amino acid protein shares 80%
homology with rat Hcarg. Multiple-tissue expression array analysis
detected high expression in heart, stomach, jejunum, kidney, liver, and
adrenal gland. Expression was generally higher in adult organs than in
fetal tissues, particularly in heart, kidney, and liver. In situ
hybridization of rat tissues detected expression in the medulla and zona
fasciculata of the adrenal cortex and in the tubules of the kidney, but
showed no expression in renal glomeruli. Immunofluorescence microscopy
of transfected COS-7 cells and immunohistochemical staining of rat
pituitary detected Hcarg predominantly localized to the nucleus, with
some staining at sites of protein synthesis.

GENE FUNCTION

Solban et al. (2000) found that expression of Hcarg was higher in the
adrenal cortex and kidney tubules of hypertensive rats compared with
their normotensive controls. Rat Hcarg inhibited cell proliferation in
human embryonic kidney cells following transfection.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Solban et al. (2002) mapped the COMMD5
gene to chromosome 8q24.3.

607292	TITLE *607292 SEMAPHORIN 4A; SEMA4A
;;SEMAPHORIN B; SEMAB; SEMB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEMA4A is a member of the semaphorin family of soluble and transmembrane
proteins. Semaphorins are involved in guidance of axonal migration
during neuronal development and in immune responses.

CLONING

Using degenerate PCR primers based on motifs conserved in members of the
semaphorin family, Kumanogoh et al. (2002) identified mouse Sema4a,
which was originally identified as SemB (Puschel et al., 1995). RT-PCR
analysis detected prominent expression in adult mouse brain, spleen,
lung, kidney, and testis. Flow cytometric analysis showed expression in
B cells and dendritic cells (DCs) but not in resting T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kumanogoh et al. (2002) showed that activation upregulated expression of
mouse Sema4a in both B and T cells, and proliferation and interleukin-2
(IL2; 147680) production by T cells were enhanced in the presence of
Sema4a. However, Sema4a, unlike CD100 (SEMA4D; 601866), did not enhance
the activation of B cells or DCs. Mice treated with Sema4a had enhanced
priming of antigen-specific T cells secreting both IL4 (147780) and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570). Treatment of mice with anti-Sema4a
early after immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
suppressed the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
In these mice, infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells was
ablated by inhibition of the generation of antigen-specific T cells by
anti-Sema4a. Expression cloning determined that the high-affinity
receptor for Sema4a is Tim2. Sema4a stimulation of cells expressing Tim2
induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Tim2 but not of Tim3 (606652).
Kumanogoh et al. (2002) concluded that Sema4a and CD100 have crucial
roles in the reciprocal stimulation between T cell and
antigen-presenting cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Abid et al. (2006) screened 135 Pakistani patients with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP35; 610282), 25 with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD10; 610283),
and 30 with congenital blindness for mutations in the SEMA4A gene. They
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 substitutions
(607292.0001-607292.0002) in 2 RP and 2 CORD patients and heterozygosity

613110	TITLE *613110 BLADDER CANCER-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; BLCAP
;;BLADDER CANCER-ASSOCIATED, 10-KD; BC10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The BLCAP gene is a tumor suppressor that limits cell proliferation and
stimulates apoptosis. BLCAP protein or message is downregulated or
absent in a variety of human cancers (Schulz et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using differential display to identify genes upregulated in tumor
biopsies obtained from a noninvasive compared with invasive bladder
transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs), Gromova et al. (1999) identified
BLCAP, which they designated BC10. Gromova et al. (2002) cloned
full-length BC10 from a cDNA library developed from a noninvasive TCC.
The deduced 87-amino acid peptide has a calculated molecular mass of 9.8
kD. It has an N-terminal cytoplasmic region, followed by a proline-rich
region with characteristics of the SRC (190090) homology-3
domain-binding site, 2 highly hydrophobic regions, and a C terminus with
a putative casein kinase II (see CSNK2A1, 115440) phosphorylation site.
Human and mouse BC10 share 100% amino acid identity, and the
corresponding transcripts share 95% nucleotide identity in the coding
region. Close orthologs were also detected in nematode and fly,
suggesting a high degree of conservation. Northern blot analysis
detected a transcript of about 2 kb in noninvasive TCC. Two-dimensional
separation of proteins in BC10-expressing COS cells, followed by Western
blot analysis, revealed a major acidic form of BC10, and a minor basic
form of BC10, both at an apparent molecular mass of 10 kD. The acidic
form is likely phosphorylated.

Schulz et al. (2009) identified at least 4 distinct human BLCAP
transcripts and 2 distinct mouse transcripts. They referred to BLCAP
transcripts with translation start sites downstream of NNAT (603106),
which is within intron 1 of BLCAP, as BLCAP-V1A, -V1B, and -V1C, and
they referred to the BLCAP transcript with translation start site
upstream of NNAT as BLCAP-V2A.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR, Gromova et al. (2002) confirmed
that the expression of BLCAP was downregulated in invasive bladder TCCs.

Yao et al. (2007) stated that expression of BLCAP is downregulated in
several types of carcinomas and overexpression of BLCAP in HeLa cells
induces apoptosis. They found that BLCAP overexpression in a human
tongue carcinoma cell line induced S phase arrest and apoptosis,
accompanied by upregulation of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and downregulation
of BCL2 (151430) and BCLXL (BCL2L1; 600039).

GENE STRUCTURE

Schulz et al. (2009) noted that the BLCAP gene consists of 2 exons
traversing approximately 13 kb, with evidence for 2 alternative exons
resulting in minor splice variants. In mouse and human, the first intron
of the BLCAP gene contains the distinct neuronatin (NNAT; 603106) gene,
which is an imprinted gene exclusively expressed from the paternally
inherited allele.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gromova et al. (2002) mapped the BLCAP
gene to chromosome 20q11.2-q12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schulz et al. (2009) found that mouse Blcap-v1 transcripts were
preferentially expressed from maternally-inherited alleles in adult and
fetal brain but not in other murine tissues, and likewise human BLCAP-V1
transcripts showed similar preferential expression from
maternally-inherited alleles in adult and fetal brain. Mouse and human
BLCAP-V2A transcripts were found predominantly expressed from
paternally-inherited alleles in brain. They proposed that the
tissue-specific imprinting of BLCAP may be due to the particularly high
transcriptional activity of NNAT in brain. Schulz et al. (2009)
hypothesized that the imprinted expression of BLCAP and its interplay
with NNAT at the transcriptional level may be relevant to human
carcinogenesis.

605475	TITLE *605475 BAI1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; BAIAP2
;;INSULIN RECEPTOR SUBSTRATE p53; IRSP53
DESCRIPTION Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 (BAI1; 602682) is a secretin
receptor family member whose expression is induced by p53 (191170). Yeh
et al. (1996) cloned a hamster cDNA encoding a 53-kD BAI-associated
protein which, when expressed in mammalian cells, is tyrosine
phosphorylated by the insulin receptor. They termed the protein IRSp53
for insulin receptor substrate p53. The protein contains 521 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 57 kD and is highly expressed in the
brain. The protein appears to be localized primarily in the particulate
fraction of cell lysates. The IRSp53 cDNA was found to encode an
additional protein product of 58 kD (p58) in vivo.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with cytoplasmic BAI1 as bait, followed by
screening of a human fetal brain cDNA library, Oda et al. (1999)
isolated a cDNA encoding BAIAP2 and a splice variant. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 520- and 521-amino acid proteins are homologous to
hamster IRSp53 with identity conserved in the C-terminal SH3 domain.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 3.2-kb transcript
primarily in brain with very low levels in placenta, prostate, and
testis as well as ubiquitous expression of a 2.2-kb transcript that is
relatively abundant in liver, prostate, testis, and placenta. The
expression of the 3.2-kb transcript overlaps that of BAI1 in brain
subregions, is similar to that of neuron- and neuroendocrine-restricted
NSE (ENO2; 131360), but different from that of astrocyte-specific GFAP
(137780). Yeast 2-hybrid and GST pull-down analyses with mutated
proteins confirmed that the SH3 domain of BAIAP2 interacts with the
proline-rich cytoplasmic portion of BAI1. Double immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated colocalization of BAI1 and BAIAP2 in the
cytoplasmic membrane, whereas cells expressing BAIAP2 alone showed
diffuse staining of the cytosol and nucleus.

Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA; 125370) is an autosomal
dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
selective neuron death in the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian pathways
and is associated with CAG repeats in the DRPLA gene (607462). Using a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library with
N-terminus-deleted DRPLA as bait, Okamura-Oho et al. (1999) identified
cDNAs encoding human IRSP53. Sequence analysis identified deduced
proteins of 552 and 521 amino acids. The latter sequence is 94%
identical to hamster IRSp53. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
of a 3.0-kb transcript in most tissues examined and a 3.8-kb transcript
mainly in brain, suggesting alternative splicing. After stimulation of
cells with insulin, immunoblot analysis detected a phosphorylated 58-kD
IRSP53 protein which did not enhance binding to DRPLA.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis and reporter gene assays indicated that
DRPLA and IRSP53 do interact. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization in perinuclear dots. GST pull-down analysis determined
that the SH3 domain in the C terminus of IRSP53 binds to a proline-rich
region of DRPLA, which may be interfered with by extended polyglutamine
tracts in the form of CAG repeats.

Miki et al. (2000) demonstrated that IRSP53 is the critical linker
between RAC (see 602048) and WAVE2 (605875). Activated RAC binds to the
N terminus of IRSP53, and the C-terminal SH3 domain of IRSP53 binds to
WAVE2 to form a trimolecular complex. From studies of ectopic
expression, Miki et al. (2000) found that IRSP53 is essential for RAC to
induce membrane ruffling, probably because it recruits WAVE2, which
stimulates actin polymerization mediated by the ARP2/3 complex.

By FISH, Oda et al. (1999) mapped the BAIAP2 gene to chromosome 17q25.

;;SET7;;
SET9;;
HISTONE H3-LYSINE 4-SPECIFIC METHYLTRANSFERASE;;
H3-K4-HMTase;;
KIAA1717
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Methylation of histone H3 (see 602810) at lysine-9 (K9) by SUV39H1
(300254) and the subsequent recruitment of heterochromatin protein-1
(HP1; see 604478) is linked to gene silencing. In addition to K9, H3
methylation also occurs at K4, K27, and K36. Wang et al. (2001) reported
the purification, molecular identification, and functional
characterization of an H3-K4-specific methyltransferase (H3-K4-HMTase)
that they named SET7 due to the presence of a SET domain in its C
terminus. The authors determined that the SET7 cDNA, which is identical
to the KIAA1717 cDNA reported by Nagase et al. (2000), encodes a
366-amino acid protein that is 96% identical to its mouse homolog.

Nishioka et al. (2002) isolated SET7, which they termed SET9, from HeLa
cells. The predicted protein contains a SET domain, but it lacks the
pre- and post-SET domains.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) showed that SET7 methylates H3-K4 in vitro and in
vivo and that methylation of H3-K4 and methylation of H3-K9 inhibit each
other. Furthermore, H3-K4 methylation and H3-K9 methylation by SET7 and
SUV39H1, respectively, were found to have differential effects on
subsequent histone acetylation by p300 (602700). This study provided a
molecular explanation to the differential effects of H3-K4 and H3-K9
methylation on transcription.

Chuikov et al. (2004) reported a novel mechanism of p53 (191170)
regulation through lysine methylation by Set9 methyltransferase. Set9
specifically methylates p53 at lys372 within the C-terminal regulatory
region. Methylated p53 is restricted to the nucleus and the modification
positively affects its stability. Set9 regulates the expression of p53
target genes in a manner dependent on the p53 methylation site. The
crystal structure of a ternary complex of Set9 with a p53 peptide and
the cofactor product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine provided the molecular
basis for recognition of p53 by this lysine methyltransferase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

The evolutionarily conserved SET domain occurs in most proteins known to
possess histone lysine methyltransferase activity. Wilson et al. (2002)
described the crystal structure of a large fragment of human SET7 that
contains an N-terminal beta-sheet domain as well as the conserved SET
domain. Mutagenesis identified 2 residues in the C terminus of the
protein that appeared essential for catalytic activity toward lys4 of
histone H3. Furthermore, the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)
bound to this domain. Wilson et al. (2002) presented biochemical data
supporting the role of invariant residues in catalysis, binding of
AdoMet, and interactions with the peptide substrate.

Xiao et al. (2003) identified the high-resolution crystal structure of a
ternary complex of human SET7/9 with a histone peptide and cofactor,
which revealed that the peptide substrate and cofactor bind on opposite
surfaces of the enzyme. The target lysine accesses the active site of
the enzyme and the S-adenosyl-L-methionine cofactor by inserting its
side chain into a narrow channel that runs through the enzyme,
connecting the 2 surfaces. Xiao et al. (2003) showed from the structure
and from solution studies that SET7/9, unlike most other SET proteins,
is exclusively a mono-methylase. The structure indicates the molecular
basis of the specificity of the enzyme for the histone target, and Xiao
et al. (2003) proposed a model for the methylation reaction that
accounts for the role of many of the residues that are invariant across
the SET family.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SETD7
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP D4S3221).

PROTEIN KINASE p58; PK58; p58;;
CDC-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE p58;;

CDK11
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Bunnell et al. (1990) identified a human cell division control
(CDC)-related protein kinase, p58, that is structurally and functionally
related to p34(cdc2) (CDC2; 116940). Abnormal expression of the p58
protein kinase in eukaryotic cells had effects suggesting that it is a
negative regulator of normal cell cycle progression. The gene is well
conserved evolutionarily. Its expression is regulated during murine
embryogenesis, and its activity is coordinately regulated with that of
p34(cdc2) during the cell cycle.

Lahti et al. (1994) characterized the genomic region surrounding CDC2L1
and found that a related gene, CDC2L2 (116951), was located within 100
kb. They referred to CDC2L1 as PITSLRE B, based on the amino acid
sequence of the region corresponding to the conserved CDC2 PSTAIRE box.

Xiang et al. (1994) isolated multiple, alternatively spliced CDC2L1 and
CDC2L2 mRNAs. The CDC2L1 transcripts encode protein isoforms ranging in
size from 58 to 110 kD. The isoforms vary in the length and sequence of
their N-terminal regions; the protein kinase catalytic and C-terminal
domains are identical. All contain a 30-residue acid blob domain
comprised primarily of glutamic acid. The larger protein species
contained a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal. Western blot
analysis revealed that the 58-kD isoform was present only in cells
undergoing apoptosis. Xiang et al. (1994) analyzed the expression
pattern of the CDC2L1 mRNAs.

The CDC2L1 and CDC2L2 genes encode almost identical protein kinases of
110 kD that contain at their C termini the open reading frame of a
smaller isoform of 58 kD. Cornelis et al. (2000) found that 2 PITSLRE
protein kinase isoforms, p110 and p58, are translated from a single
transcript by initiation at alternative in-frame AUG codons. p110 is
produced by classic cap-dependent translation, whereas p58 results from
internal initiation of translation controlled by an internal ribosome
entry site (IRES) with unique properties. The IRES element is localized
to the mRNA coding region, and its activity is cell cycle regulated,
permitting translation of p58 in G2/M.

Loyer et al. (2008) stated that both CDC2L2 and CDC2L1 can produce a
third isoform, p46, by caspase-dependent proteolysis of either the p110
or p58 isoforms. By immunofluorescence analysis of several human cell
lines, they detected p110 in both nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles.
Western blot analysis showed robust expression of p110 in several human
cell lines and in activated human peripheral blood cells. Only activated
blood cells expressed p58 and p46. Size exclusion chromatography of HeLa
cells revealed that p110 fractionated with protein complexes of about
170 kD to over 1 MDa.

GENE FUNCTION

Lahti et al. (1994) demonstrated that 1 allele of the entire gene CDC2L
complex was either deleted or translocated in 18 of 20 neuroblastoma
(256700) cell lines investigated. They suggested that the CDC2L gene
complex may harbor 1 or more tumor suppressor genes affected by
chromosome 1p36 modifications in neuroblastoma.

By immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays with human
cell lines, Loyer et al. (2008) found that p110 CDK11 associated with
the alpha and beta isoforms of cyclin L1 (CCNL1; 613384) and L2 (CCNL2;
613482) in a high molecular mass complex that showed splicing activity.
The p58 and p46 CDK11 isoforms interacted more weakly with the cyclin L
alpha isoforms. In vivo splicing assays showed that expression of cyclin
L1-alpha, L1-beta, L2-alpha, or L2-beta and/or p110 CDK11 increased
intron-splicing activity and altered alternative splice-site selection
in a cyclin L1 and L2 isoform- and cell type-specific manner. In
contrast with p110 CDK11, p58 and p46 CDK11 reduced splicing activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Eipers et al. (1992) detailed the complete structure of the CDC2L1 gene
including its putative promoter region, transcriptional start sites,
exonic sequences, and intron/exon boundary sequences. The gene is 10 kb
and contains 12 exons and 11 introns.

Gururajan et al. (1998) determined the structure of the 140-kb CDC2L
genomic region. This region consists of 2 identical genomic segments
arranged in a tail-to-tail configuration. Each segment contains a CDC2L
gene linked to an MMP gene. See MMP21 (603320). In each case, the most
widely expressed products of the CDC2L gene are derived from a genomic
region that is composed of 20 exons and spans approximately 20 kb. The
authors reported that only 15 amino acids of the 773-786 residues that
encode the multiple CDC2L isoforms are unique to either CDC2L1 or
CDC2L2.

MAPPING

Eipers et al. (1991) assigned the expressed p58 gene to 1p36 by somatic
cell hybrid analysis, in situ hybridization, and nested PCR
amplification of microdissected chromosomes. The authors stated that
this gene, tentatively symbolized PK58, may be implicated in the
pathogenesis of tumors that have deletion in the region of 1p36.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lahti et al. (1994) mapped the
CDC2L1 gene to 1p36.3.

White et al. (1995) showed that CDC2L1 is located outside the consensus
region of allelic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) associated with
neuroblastomas, namely, 1p36.3-p36.2, and is therefore not the
neuroblastoma suppressor gene.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ST3GAL3 gene encodes
beta-galactoside-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase-III, a Golgi resident
membrane protein that forms the sialyl Lewis a (sLe-a) epitope on
glyocoproteins. These glycoproteins form the glycocalyx, composed of
sialic acids that act as key determinants of a variety of cellular
recognition and communication processes (summary by Hu et al., 2011).

CLONING

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with a probe based on the
sialyl motif (a highly conserved region in the catalytic domain of
sialyltransferases), Kitagawa and Paulson (1993) isolated a cDNA
encoding SIAT6, which they termed ST3N (EC 2.4.99.6). The deduced
375-amino acid protein is 97% identical to the rat protein. SDS-PAGE
analysis showed expression of an 80-kD protein having sialyltransferase
activity. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript with abundant expression in skeletal muscle and high
expression in fetal tissue but low expression in placenta.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kitagawa and Paulson (1994) evaluated the
differential expression of 5 human sialyltransferase genes in adult and
fetal tissues. A 2.7-kb ST3N transcript was expressed highly in skeletal
muscle and moderately in most other tissues examined. A 3.8-kb
transcript was also expressed in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Taniguchi et al. (2003) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the ST3GAL3
gene consists of 2 exons. The 5-prime flanking region of the promoter
lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but it contains several putative
transcriptional factor binding sites.

Hu et al. (2011) stated that the ST3GAL3 gene contains 15 exons, 12 of
which are coding exons.

MAPPING

The International RH Mapping Consortium mapped the SIAT6 gene to
chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG22084).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Mental Retardation 12

In affected members of 2 unrelated consanguineous Iranian families with
autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090),
Hu et al. (2011) used linkage analysis, chromosome sorting, and
next-generation sequencing to identify 2 different homozygous mutations
in the ST3GAL3 gene (A13D, 606494.0001 and D370Y, 606494.0002,
respectively.) Neither mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl
motifs, but rather affected the N-terminal transmembrane domain and
catalytic domain, respectively. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutant proteins were mislocalized to the endoplasmic
reticulum and that one (D370Y) had loss of catalytic activity. The
findings demonstrated a link between the glycoprotein complex,
sialyltransferase activity, and higher cognitive functioning.

- Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 15

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous mutation in the ST3GAL3 gene (A320P;
606494.0003). The mutation was identified by linkage analysis combined
with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The mutation affected the highly conserved sialyl motif S,
which is crucially involved in binding of both donor and acceptor
substrate. In vitro functional expression studies showed that secretion
of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of control levels and it had no
detectable enzymatic activity. The phenotype was severe: patients showed
delayed psychomotor development and had onset of refractory infantile
spasms between ages 3 and 7 months associated with hypsarrhythmia on
EEG. Other features included hypotonia, poor eye contact, and inability
to speak or walk, even later in childhood. All were profoundly mentally
retarded. Edvardson et al. (2013) noted that the phenotype was more
severe than that observed by Hu et al. (2011), who had identified
ST3GAL3 mutations outside of the highly conserved and functionally
important sialyl motifs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12
ST3GAL3, ALA13ASP

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), previously reported by
Najmabadi et al. (2007), Hu et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 38C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the ST3GAL3 gene, resulting in an ala13-to-asp
(A13D) substitution in the transmembrane domain. The mutation was not
found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls or
in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that most of the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. Catalytic activity of the A13D mutant enzyme was similar to
wildtype.

MENTAL RETARDATION, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 12
ST3GAL3, ASP370TYR

In affected members of a consanguineous Iranian family with autosomal
recessive mental retardation-12 (MRT12; 611090), Hu et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 1108G-T transversion in exon 14 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an asp370-to-tyr (D370Y) substitution in the
catalytic domain at the C-terminal end of the protein. The mutation was
not found in 278 copies of chromosome 1 from ethnically matched controls
or in 385 control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies in
murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from
interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of
function. The D370Y mutant protein also showed a complete lack of enzyme
activity. Studies of recombinant proteins in CHO cells indicated that
secretion of the D370Y mutant protein was dramatically reduced compared
to wildtype. Hu et al. (2011) concluded that the mutant protein was
cleared by the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated system, suggesting that
the C terminus is important for the proper folding of functional
ST3GAL3.

EPILEPTIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, EARLY INFANTILE, 15
ST3GAL3, ALA320PRO

In 4 members of a consanguineous Palestinian family with early infantile
epileptic encephalopathy-15 (EIEE15; 615006), Edvardson et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous 958G-C transversion in exon 12 of the ST3GAL3
gene, resulting in an ala320-to-pro (A320P) substitution at a highly
conserved residue in the sialyl motif S. The mutation was identified by
linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing of 1 individual
and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. It segregated with the disorder in
the family and was not found in 123 controls of the same ethnic origin
or in 5,379 control exomes. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that secretion of the mutant protein was reduced to 25% of
control levels and that the protein had no detectable enzymatic
activity.

615417	TITLE *615417 BET1-LIKE PROTEIN; BET1L
;;GOLGI SNARE, 15-KD; GS15
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BET1L is part of a SNARE (SNAP receptor) complex that recruits soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF; 601633) attachment proteins
(SNAPs) to membranes. BET1L is a vesicle-associated SNARE (v-SNARE) that
pairs with a target membrane SNARE (t-SNARE), such as GOS28 (GOSR1;
604026) and syntaxin-5 (STX5; 603189) (Xu et al., 1997; Volchuk et al.,
2004).

CLONING

By searching databases using rat Bet1 (605456) as probe, followed by
screening a rat brain cDNA library, Xu et al. (1997) cloned rat Bet1l,
which they called Gs15. The deduced 111-amino acid protein has a
C-terminal hydrophobic region that may function as a membrane anchor.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression in rat tissues.
Immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
expression of a 15-kD protein on Golgi membranes.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (1997) showed that rat Gs15 bound to recombinant SNAP. They
concluded that GS15 is a C-terminal tail-anchored integral membrane
v-SNARE associated with the Golgi apparatus.

Using immunoelectron microscopy with mammalian cell lines and tissues,
Xu et al. (2002) showed that Gs15 was primarily found in the medial
cisternae of the Golgi apparatus and adjacent tubulovesicular elements.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis identified rat Gs15 as part of a distinct
SNARE complex containing 3 other SNAREs, Stx5, Gs28, and Ykt6 (606209),
implicated in both ER-to-Golgi and intra-Golgi transport. Inhibition of
GS15 expression by small interfering RNA in HeLa cells resulted in
redistribution of Golgi markers into small dotty and diffuse labeling.
Xu et al. (2002) proposed that GS15 has an essential role in the Golgi
apparatus.

Using quantitative immunogold labeling in mammalian cells, Volchuk et
al. (2004) showed that the distribution of t-SNAREs was nearly even
across the Golgi stack from the cis to the trans side, whereas Gs15 was
present in a gradient of increasing concentration toward the trans face
of the stack. In contrast, the v- and t-SNARE subunits of a second
distinct SNARE complex required for intra-Golgi transport decreased in
concentration toward the trans face. Volchuk et al. (2004) proposed that
transport within the stack uses countercurrent gradients of 2 Golgi
SNAREpins (i.e., complexes of cognate v- and t-SNAREs bridging 2
membranes) and may involve a homotypic fusion mechanism.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the BET1L gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the BET1L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF234160) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

IKAROS; IK1;;

IKAROS/BCL6 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ikaros proteins are lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription
factors that are considered master regulators of lymphocyte
differentiation. Klug et al. (1998) noted that there are at least 8
alternatively spliced transcripts of the Ikaros gene that encode
isoforms with common N-terminal and C-terminal domains. By screening a
Jurkat T-cell cDNA library with a mouse Ikaros cDNA, Molnar et al.
(1996) isolated human Ikaros cDNAs. The deduced human and mouse Ikaros
proteins are 95% identical. RT-PCR of human thymus and peripheral blood
leukocyte mRNAs detected 6 Ikaros splicing variants which were expressed
at similar levels and ratios as the corresponding mouse leukocyte Ikaros
transcripts. The authors found that Ikaros proteins are conserved in
sequence composition and relative expression between human T cells and
mouse thymocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of
7.5- and 4.5-kb Ikaros transcripts in human thymus, spleen, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By PCR using primers based on a conserved nucleotide sequence of various
zinc finger proteins, Nietfeld and Meyerhans (1996) cloned human bone
marrow cDNAs encoding Ikaros, which they designated IK1. The deduced
519-amino acid protein is 93% identical to the mouse Ikaros isoform
1/LyF1 isoform VI and contains 4 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal zinc finger
domains. The authors detected 3 human mRNA species by Northern blot
analysis: a 4.4-kb transcript, which was prominent in peripheral blood
leukocytes; a 6.0-kb transcript, which was strongly expressed in spleen,
thymus, lymph node, and bone marrow; and a 7.0-kb transcript. They
stated that the human and mouse Ikaros genes have similar overall
transcription patterns.

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger
domain of Ikaros proteins is involved in DNA binding, while the
C-terminal zinc finger domain mediates homo- or heterodimerization with
other Ikaros proteins. Alternative splicing of exons 3 to 6 produces
Ikaros isoforms with 0 to 4 N-terminal zinc fingers, and those with at
least 3 efficiently bind DNA. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms include
IK1, IK2, IK3, and IKX, and IK4 can bind DNA on palindromic sequences.
IK5, IK6, IK7, and IK8 are considered dominant-negative isoforms due to
their capacity to bind other isoforms and their inefficiency in binding
DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Harker et al. (2002) showed that Ikaros may play an important role in
CD4 (186940) versus CD8 (see CD8A; 186910) lineage commitment decisions
by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements in the
endogenous CD8A locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin
immunoprecipitations; (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect
variegation of transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements; and (3)
that mice with reduced levels of Ikaros and Aiolos (606221) show an
apparent increase in CD4 populations with immature phenotype, i.e.,
cells that fail to activate the CD8A gene. The authors proposed that
Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8A gene and that
their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin
remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage
commitment.

Ezzat et al. (2005) demonstrated that Ikaros is expressed in the
hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells of mice, where it
binds the proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene
expression. Ikaros-null mice had contraction of the pituitary
corticomelanotroph population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic
hormone levels, and adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency. Hematopoietic
reconstitution failed to correct this hormonal deficit, but the
phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished survival was rescued by
systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Ezzat et al. (2005)
concluded that Ikaros plays a role in orchestrating immune-endocrine
development and function.

Yap et al. (2005) identified Ikaros-binding elements in the 5-prime
flanking regions of pufferfish, mouse, and human STAT4 (600558).
Transactivation, electrophoretic mobility shift, and RNA interference
analyses showed that Ikaros bound to the STAT4 promoter and was involved
in regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

Dijon et al. (2008) found that purified CD34 (142230)-positive human
cord blood cells and adult peripheral blood cells that were cultured
under erythroid conditions expressed the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms IK1
through IK4, but not the dominant-negative isoform IK6.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that expression of IK6 in these
cells resulted in complex formation between IK6 and IK1, and IK6
decreased cell number and increased cell death. IK6 overexpression
disturbed erythroid differentiation and expression of erythroid-specific
genes, although it had no effect on Ikaros expression, and favored
myelopoiesis by promoting expression of myeloid-specific genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the IKZF1 gene contains 7 translated
exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Molnar et al. (1996) mapped the human
Ikaros gene to 7p13-p11.1, near the EGFR gene (131550). They mapped the
mouse Ikaros gene to chromosome 11 by interspecific backcross analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ikaros is required for normal lymphocyte development. Germline mutant
mice that express only non-DNA-binding dominant-negative 'leukemogenic'
Ikaros isoforms lacking critical N-terminal zinc fingers develop an
aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia 3 to 6 months after birth (see
'Animal Model' below). These facts prompted Sun et al. (1999) to seek
molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL2; 613067) in infants. In leukemic cells from 12 ALL
infants less than 1 year of age, Sun et al. (1999) found high-level
expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal
subcellular compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide
sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect
Ikaros gene mutations in these cells. Leukemic cells from 7 of 7 infants
with ALL, including 5 of 5 MLL-AF4-positive (159557) infants, expressed
dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms IK4, IK7, and IK8 that lack critical
N-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 7 patients, Sun et al. (1999) detected
an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the
transcription-activation domain adjacent to the C-terminal zinc fingers
of IK2, IK4, IK7, and IK8. In contrast, only wildtype IK1 and IK2
isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in normal infant
bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicated the
expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of
normal Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.

Nakase et al. (2000) found overexpression of the dominant-negative IK6
isoform in 14 of 41 B-cell patients with adult B-cell ALL. None of the
other dominant-negative isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by
RT-PCR analysis. Southern blot analysis with PstI digestion revealed
that those patients with the dominant-negative IK6 isoform might have
small mutations in the Ikaros locus. The results suggested that Ikaros
plays a key role in human B-cell malignancies through the
dominant-negative isoform IK6.

Using RT-PCR to detect Ikaros isoforms with the 30-base deletion in exon
6, Payne et al. (2001) showed that transcripts for IK1 and IK1 with the
deletion were present in normal cord blood and bone marrow, as well as
in 3 ALL cell lines. In addition, they identified an isoform, IKX, that
was identical to IK3 except that it included exon 6; IKX was generated
from a novel exon combination with and without the 30-base deletion.
Payne et al. (2001) detected multiple DNA-binding and nonbinding
isoforms with a 60-base insertion linked to leukemia expressed at the
RNA level in normal hemopoietic cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that the predominant isoform in normal cells is IKX, while the
predominant form in leukemic cells is IK1.

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in IKZF1, IKZF3 (606221),TCF3 (147141), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes
BCR-ABL1 (see 151410, 189980), is the defining lesion of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to
induce ALL, Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of
diagnostic leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43
BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the
transcription factor Ikaros, was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but
not in chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an
acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid
blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency,
expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss
of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested
that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for
the deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Mullighan et al. (2009) identified deletions involving the IKZF1 gene in
leukemic cells of 63 (28.6%) of 221 children with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Cells from 20 patients had a deletion of coding
exons 3 through 6, resulting in the expression of a dominant-negative
form of IKZF1. IKZF1 deletions were associated with an increased risk of
relapse and adverse effects in the original cohort and in an independent
cohort of 258 patients (p values ranging from less than 0.001 to 0.004).

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
IKZF1 gene and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, see ALL2 (613067).

CYTOGENETICS

The BCL6 gene (109565), isolated from the breakpoints of 3q27-associated
chromosomal translocations, is implicated in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBL). Hosokawa et al. (2000) described the molecular
characterization of novel t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations in 2 patients
with DLBL. Molecular genetic analysis of the breakpoint area involving
BCL6 revealed the presence of the Ikaros gene. As a molecular
consequence of the translocation, the 5-prime regulatory region of BCL6
was replaced by the putative 5-prime regulatory region of the Ikaros
gene, probably leading to deregulated expression of the BCL6 gene
throughout B-cell differentiation. RT-PCR and FISH analyses of a patient
sample established that the translocation resulted in fusion of the
Ikaros and BCL6 genes. The clinical features of the 2 patients with DLBL
and t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations were reported by Ichinohasama et al.
(1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice homozygous for a germline mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain
lack not only T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but also
their earliest defined progenitors (Georgopoulos et al., 1994). In
contrast, the erythroid and myeloid lineages are intact in these mutant
mice. Klug et al. (1998) showed that the DNA-binding isoforms of mouse
Ikaros are localized in the nucleus of the most primitive hematopoietic
stem cell subset. They found that Ikaros localizes to heterochromatin in
Abelson-transformed pre-B lymphocytes. Changes in the RNA splicing
pattern of Ikaros occurred at 2 stages of lymphoid differentiation.

O'Neill et al. (1999, 2000) described the structure of a chromatin
remodeling complex associated with Ikaros that is present only in adult
hematopoietic cells. This complex binds to Ikaros-like DNA-binding
sites, including a long polypyrimidine-rich sequence upstream of the
human delta-globin gene (142000), and was thus called PYR complex.
Deletion of this sequence in a human beta locus-containing cosmid
(carrying sequences from the human gamma-A gene, 142200, through the
adult beta-globin gene, 141900) in transgenic mice resulted in delayed
switching from gamma-globin to beta-globin. Lopez et al. (2002) showed
that homozygous Ikaros-null mice lacked the PYR complex, demonstrating a
requirement for Ikaros in the formation of the complex on DNA.
Heterozygous Ikaros-null mice had about half as much PYR complex,
indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and PYR complex. They also
showed that Ikaros-null mice had multiple hematopoietic cell defects,
including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to
lymphoid and stem cell defects. The null mice also had a delay in murine
embryonic-to-adult beta-globin switching and a delay in human
gamma-to-beta switching, consistent with the suggested role for PYR
complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicated that
several hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages were
either up- or downregulated in 14-day embryos from Ikaros-null mice
compared with wildtype mice. These results indicated that Ikaros and PYR
complex function together in vivo at many adult hematopoietic
cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites, affecting their expression
and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized dendritic cells that
produce high levels of type I interferon (see IFNA1; 147660) upon viral
infection. Allman et al. (2006) showed that mice expressing low levels
of Ikaros lacked peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not other
dendritic cell subsets. Loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was
associated with inability to produce type I interferon after challenge
with Tlr7 (300365) or Tlr9 (605474) ligands or murine cytomegalovirus.
Conventional dendritic cells were present in normal numbers and
exhibited normal responses to in vivo challenge with murine
cytomegalovirus or inactivated toxoplasma antigen.

612605	TITLE *612605 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE 1C; LCE1C
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 3; LEP3
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE1C,
which they called LEP3.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected high LCE1C
expression in human fetal, arm, penal, and abdominal skin. Expression
was much lower in vulva and was not detected in tongue and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE1 genes, including
LCE1C, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by
ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, but not by calcium. Induction of LCE1C
could be detected 24 hours after UV irradiation and was very high 36
hours after UV irradiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE1C gene contains 2 exons.
Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE1C
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce1c gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

180390	TITLE *180390 RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, M2 SUBUNIT; RRM2
;;RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, SMALL SUBUNIT;;
RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE, R2 SUBUNIT; R2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RRM2 gene encodes the small subunit (R2) of ribonucleotide
reductase, the heterodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting
step in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis.

CLONING

Pavloff et al. (1992) cloned human RRM1 (180410) and RRM2 cDNAs from a
breast carcinoma cDNA library. The deduced 389-amino acid RRM2 protein
has a molecular mass of 45 kD and is 1 amino acid shorter than the
equivalent mouse protein. The human and mouse RRM2 proteins share 96%
homology in the C terminus, but only 69% in the first 68 residues in the
N terminus.

GENE FUNCTION

In dividing cells, ribonucleotide reductase is essential for the
production of deoxyribonucleotides before DNA synthesis in S phase.
Neither of its 2 subunits, R1 or R2, are detectable in quiescent cells.
In cycling cells, RRM2 mRNA and protein are present throughout the cell
cycle (summary by Parker et al., 1994).

Using a library of endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNAs
(esiRNAs), Kittler et al. (2004) identified 37 genes required for cell
division, one of which was RRM2. These 37 genes included several
splicing factors for which knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects.
In addition, a putative nuclear-export terminator was found to speed up
cell proliferation and mitotic progression after knockdown.

MAPPING

Yang-Feng et al. (1986, 1987) carried out chromosomal mapping of RRM2 by
means of a full-length mouse cDNA. By Southern blot analysis of
interspecies somatic cell hybrid lines and by in situ hybridization,
Yang-Feng et al. (1987) found that the 4 chromosomal sites carrying
M2-related sequences are 1p33-p31, 1q21-q23, 2p25-p24, and Xp21-p11. In
the mouse, M2 sequences were found on chromosomes 4, 7, 12, and 13 by
somatic cell hybrid studies. By Southern analysis of human and mouse
hydroxyurea-resistant cells that overproduce M2 due to gene
amplification, Yang-Feng et al. (1987) identified the amplified
restriction fragments as those that map to human chromosome 2 and to
mouse chromosome 12. The sites other than 2p probably represent
pseudogenes, particularly the ones on the X chromosome since active
genes on mammalian X chromosomes are conserved and no RRM2 sequence was
found on the mouse X chromosome. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC; 165640)
is coamplified with RRM2 in human and rodent hydroxyurea-resistant cell
lines. Using cDNA clones, Yang-Feng et al. (1987) mapped ODC to the same
region of human chromosome 2. In an RRM2 overproducing mouse cell line,
they found amplification of the chromosome 12-specific restriction
fragments. Thus, the functional loci of both RRM2 and ODC are on murine
chromosome 12.

606110	TITLE *606110 LY6/NEUROTOXIN 1; LYNX1
;;SECRETED LY6/PLAUR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; SLURP2;;
SECRETED LY6/UPAR-RELATED PROTEIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LYNX1 gene encodes a protein that shares characteristics with toxins
that bind and inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR; see,
e.g., CHRNA1, 100690) (Miwa et al., 1999). Components of snake venoms
often have structural and functional mammalian homologs. For example,
hemolytic snake venom toxins are related to cellular phospholipases
(e.g., PLA2G1B; 172410), and snake sarafotoxins may be related to
vertebrate endothelins (e.g., EDN1; 131240). The elapid venom
alpha-bungarotoxin also binds to and inhibits nAChR.

CLONING

By screening for central nervous system-specific, developmentally
regulated cDNAs in mouse, Miwa et al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding
GC26, which was expressed in mouse cerebellum. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 116-amino acid protein contains a signal sequence at
its N terminus, a cysteine-rich consensus motif characteristic of LY6
family proteins (e.g., CD59; 107271) and snake alpha-neurotoxins, and an
asparagine/GPI anchor motif at its C terminus. The overall structure of
GC26 is similar to that of LY6 family proteins and snake
alpha-neurotoxins, and Miwa et al. (1999) redesignated the protein
'Ly6/neurotoxin-1,' or Lynx1. A partial sequence encoding a human Lynx1
homolog has been identified (GenBank GENBANK AF321824). Northern blot
analysis revealed predominant expression of Lynx1 in mouse brain. In
situ hybridization analysis showed Lynx1 expression in neurons in
multiple brain structures. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated expression
of Lynx1 in neuronal soma and proximal dendrites.

Using microarray analysis to identify ESTs expressed predominantly in
the skin of patients with psoriasis vulgaris (see 177900), followed by
PCR and RACE of cultured keratinocyte cDNA libraries, Tsuji et al.
(2003) cloned LYNX1, which they called SLURP2. The deduced 97-amino acid
protein contains a signal peptide and 10 conserved cysteine residues
with a spacing pattern characteristic of the LY6 superfamily, but it
does not have the GPI anchor or transmembrane domains found in
membrane-bound LY6 proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.6-kb
transcript in esophagus and a 1.6-kb transcript in stomach and duodenum.
No expression was detected in other tissues examined, including skin.
RT-PCR detected abundant LYNX1 expression in cervix and esophagus, with
lower expression in adult and fetal skin and keratinocytes. Weak
expression was detected in brain, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon,
rectum, uterus, and thymus. No expression was detected in spleen and
bone marrow. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected a 3.8- to
2.8-fold increase in LYNX1 expression in lesional skin from 5 psoriasis
patients compared with nonlesional skin or normal skin.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Miwa et al. (1999) indicated that Lynx1 is not a
ligand or neurotransmitter but has the capacity to enhance nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor function in the presence of acetylcholine.

Morishita et al. (2010) identified an increase in expression of Lynx1
protein in mice that prevented plasticity in the primary visual cortex
late in life. Removal of this molecular brake enhanced nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor signaling. Lynx1 expression thus maintains
stability of mature cortical networks in the presence of cholinergic
innervation. Morishita et al. (2010) concluded that modulating the
balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits reactivates visual
plasticity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsuji et al. (2003) determined that the LYNX1 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 5.6 kb. The promoter region contains 3 Sp1 (189906)- and 2
AP1 (165160)-binding sites, as well as single sites for E2F (189971) and
GATA3 (131320). It lacks TATA and CAAT consensus sequences. There are 2
major transcriptional initiation sites.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tsuji et al. (2003) mapped the LYNX1 gene
to chromosome 8q24.3. Southern blot analysis indicated that LYNX1 is a
single-copy gene.

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including LYNX1, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miwa et al. (2006) found that Lynx1 -/- mice showed no gross
abnormalities in size, viability, CNS morphology, or longevity compared
to wildtype mice. However, Lynx1-null mice showed increased learning and
memory in a fear-conditioned paradigm and displayed increased
sensitivity to nicotine in motor tasks compared to wildtype. Neurons
from Lynx1-null mice showed heightened sensitivity and increased
intracellular calcium levels in response to nicotine. Loss of Lynx1
decreased receptor desensitization and enhanced synaptic efficacy.
Mutant neurons were also more sensitive to excitotoxic insult, and Lynx1
mutant mice exhibited age-dependent degeneration that was exacerbated by
nicotine and rescued by null mutations in nAChR subunits. These data
supported the hypotheses that Lynx1 normally decreases activity of
nAChRs and that deletion of Lynx1 shifts the balance in favor of
increased neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. But the short-term
benefits of the loss of Lynx1 were counterbalanced by an increased
vulnerability of Lynx1 mutant neurons to glutamate toxicity and by loss
of nicotine's neuroprotective effect on these cells. Miwa et al. (2006)
concluded that Lynx1 modulates nAChR function to maintain low
sensitivity and plays a critical role in maintaining a balance between
the beneficial effects of short-term nAChR activation and the
degenerative effects of chronic receptor activation.

603069	TITLE *603069 DUAL-SPECIFICITY PHOSPHATASE 5; DUSP5
;;VH1-LIKE PHOSPHATASE 3; HVH3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) constitute a large heterogeneous
subgroup of the type I cysteine-based protein-tyrosine phosphatase
superfamily. DUSPs are characterized by their ability to dephosphorylate
both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. DUSP1 belongs to a class of
DUSPs, designated MKPs, that dephosphorylate MAPK (mitogen-activated
protein kinase) proteins ERK (see 601795), JNK (see 601158), and p38
(see 600289) with specificity distinct from that of individual MKP
proteins. MKPs contain a highly conserved C-terminal catalytic domain
and an N-terminal Cdc25 (see 116947)-like (CH2) domain. MAPK activation
cascades mediate various physiologic processes, including cellular
proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and stress responses (summary
by Patterson et al., 2009).

CLONING

To identify human dual-specificity PTPases, Martell et al. (1994)
screened a genomic library with a partial DUSP1 (600714) cDNA. They
isolated several novel PTPase genes, including DUSP5, which they
designated HVH3 for human VH1-like PTPase-3.

Kwak and Dixon (1995) cloned human placenta DUSP5 cDNAs and reported
that the predicted protein has 384 amino acids. Using
immunofluorescence, they determined that epitope-tagged DUSP5 is
localized primarily in the nucleus of mammalian cells.

Ishibashi et al. (1994) isolated DUSP5 cDNAs from a human mammary
epithelial cell cDNA library and found that the predicted protein has
397 amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed that DUSP5 is expressed
as a 2.5-kb mRNA in a variety of tissues, with the highest levels in
pancreas and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Ishibashi et al. (1994) found that, in vitro, recombinant protein
containing the catalytic domain of DUSP5 displayed phosphatase activity
toward several substrates. The highest relative activity was toward ERK1
(601795), suggesting that it may be a target for DUSP5 activity in vivo.
Ishibashi et al. (1994) showed that DUSP5 expression was induced by
serum stimulation of fibroblasts and by heat shock, with similar
kinetics to those observed with DUSP1. As has been proposed for other
dual-specificity PTPases like DUSP1 and DUSP2 (603068), Ishibashi et al.
(1994) suggested that the induction of DUSP5 may lead to the
deactivation of mitogen- or stress-activated protein kinases, thereby
restoring these signaling pathways to their mitogen- or stress-sensitive
state.

Using morpholino-mediated gene knockdown in zebrafish, Pramanik et al.
(2009) showed that Dusp5 and Snrk1 (SNRK; 612760) targeted a common
signaling pathway and coordinately functioned in controlling angioblast
numbers at the lateral plate mesoderm. Dusp5 was expressed in
angioblasts in embryonic zebrafish and was essential for vascular
development. Loss of Dusp5 resulted in endothelial cell apoptosis.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Martell et al. (1994) mapped the
DUSP5 gene to 10q25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutations

Pramanik et al. (2009) identified an apparently somatic ser147-to-pro
(S147P) mutation in the DUSP5 gene in 1 of 3 infantile hemangioma
(602089) samples and in 12 of 17 lymphatic, arteriovenous, and venous
malformation samples. The mutation was not found in normal human
placenta, control human umbilical vein endothelial cells, or tonsillar
tissue from unrelated individuals. In addition, a somatic arg248-to-gln
(R248Q) mutation in the SNRK gene was found in 8 of the vascular anomaly
samples, including venous and lymphatic malformations, but not in
infantile hemangiomas. Six of the 8 samples with the SNRK mutation also
carried the DUSP5 S147P mutation. Since studies in zebrafish implicated
a role for the Dusp5/Snrk signaling pathway in vascular development, the
findings suggested that variation in these genes may provide
susceptibility to the development of vascular anomalies in humans.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The flavin-containing monooxygenases (EC 1.14.13.8) are microsomal
enzymes that catalyze the NADPH-dependent oxygenation of a large number
of structurally diverse foreign compounds including many therapeutic
drugs and pesticides. FMO3 is the largest of the FMO proteins (Phillips
et al., 1995).

CLONING

Dolphin et al. (1992) cloned the human FMO4 gene, which they called
FMO2, by screening an adult human liver library with the porcine coding
sequence. The cDNA encodes a deduced 558-amino acid protein with a
molecular mass of 63,338 Da. FMO2 shows 51 to 53% primary sequence
identity with FMO1 (136130). The corresponding mRNA was present in low
abundance in adult human liver. Southern blot hybridization with single
exon probes demonstrated that human FMO4 and FMO1 are, in each case, the
product of a single gene.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis, Dolphin et al. (1992) mapped the FMO4 gene to
chromosome 1.

NOMENCLATURE

Lawton et al. (1994) proposed a reclassification of mammalian FMOs.
Under this system, FMO2 described by Dolphin et al. (1992) is now
designated FMO4.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a CD8+ T-lymphocyte cDNA library with a mouse lymphotactin
probe, Kennedy et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding the lymphotactin
XCL1, later designated SCYC1. The sequence of the deduced 114-amino acid
protein is most homologous to the CC chemokines CCL8 (602283) and CCL3
(182283), but differs in that it lacks the first and third cysteines
characteristic of CC and CXC chemokines. By Northern blot analysis,
Kennedy et al. (1995) and Yoshida et al. (1995) revealed expression of
an 0.8-kb SCYC1 transcript in activated thymic and peripheral blood CD8+
but not CD4+ T cells. In normal tissues, SCYC1 is expressed at high
levels in spleen, thymus, small intestine, and peripheral blood
leukocytes, as well as at low levels in lung, prostate, and ovary; it
shows little or no expression in colon and testis. Lymphotactin is
chemotactic for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but not for monocytes, and induces
a rise in intracellular calcium in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Yoshida
et al. (1995) and Muller et al. (1995) had identified the same sequence,
termed SCM1 and ATAC, respectively, homologous to mouse lymphotactin,
but were unable to demonstrate chemotaxis or calcium mobilization.

Kennedy et al. (1995) also identified a variant of SCYC1 which differed
from SCYC1 by only 2 amino acid residues. This variant was later found
to be a separate gene; see SCYC2 604828.

GENE FAMILY

Chemokines are a group of small (approximately 8 to 14 kD), mostly
basic, structurally related molecules that regulate cell trafficking of
various types of leukocytes through interactions with a subset of
7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (Kennedy et al., 1995).
Chemokines also play fundamental roles in the development, homeostasis,
and function of the immune system, and they have effects on cells of the
central nervous system as well as on endothelial cells involved in
angiogenesis or angiostasis. Chemokines are divided into 2 major
subfamilies, CXC and CC, based on the arrangement of the first 2 of the
4 conserved cysteine residues; the 2 cysteines are separated by a single
amino acid in CXC chemokines and are adjacent in CC chemokines.

GENE FUNCTION

Yoshida et al. (1998) observed that XCL1 induces the migration of cells
expressing XCR1 (600552).

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Yoshida et al. (1995) and Kennedy et
al. (1995) mapped the SCYC1 gene to chromosome 1. Kennedy et al. (1995)
noted that the region to which mouse lymphotactin was located on
chromosome 1 by Kelner et al. (1994) is syntenic to human 1q23-q25.
Yoshida et al. (1996) and Muller et al. (1995) mapped the gene to
chromosome 1q23 by FISH.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The vesicular monoamine transporter acts to accumulate cytosolic
monoamines into synaptic vesicles, using the proton gradient maintained
across the synaptic vesicular membrane. Its proper function is essential
to the correct activity of the monoaminergic systems that have been
implicated in several human neuropsychiatric disorders. The transporter
is a site of action of important drugs, including reserpine and
tetrabenazine (summary by Peter et al., 1993).

See also SLC18A1 (193002).

CLONING

Liu et al. (1992) and Erickson et al. (1992) investigated cDNAs encoding
the synaptic vesicular monoamine transporter in rat brain. Using
sequences from rat brain SVMT, Surratt et al. (1993) identified the
human homolog. Human SVMT shares 92% amino acid identity with the rat
sequence but displays one less consensus site for asparagine N-linked
glycosylation and one more consensus site for phosphorylation by protein
kinase C.

GENE FUNCTION

Tritsch et al. (2012) demonstrated that activation of dopamine neurons
in striatal slices rapidly inhibits action potential firing in both
direct- and indirect-pathway striatal projection neurons through
vesicular release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA. GABA is released
directly from dopaminergic axons but in a manner that is independent of
the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT (SLC32A1). Instead, GABA release
requires activity of the vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2, which is
the vesicular transporter for dopamine. Furthermore, VMAT2 expression in
GABAergic neurons lacking VGAT is sufficient to sustain GABA release.
Tritsch et al. (2012) concluded that their findings expand the
repertoire of synaptic mechanisms used by dopamine neurons to influence
basal ganglia circuits, show a new substrate whose transport is
dependent on VMAT2, and demonstrate that GABA can function as a bona
fide cotransmitter in monoaminergic neurons.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of human/rodent hybrid cell lines and
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Surratt et al. (1993) mapped the
human SLC18A2 gene to chromosome 10q25. They also demonstrated a TaqI
polymorphism that may prove useful in assessing the gene's involvement
in neuropsychiatric disorders involving monoaminergic brain systems.
Peter et al. (1993) likewise assigned the SLC18A2 gene to chromosome
10q25 using a panel of mouse/human hybrids and in situ hybridization.

Roghani et al. (1996) showed that the mouse Slc18a2 gene maps to mouse
chromosome 19 by linkage analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lin et al. (2005) sequenced the 17.4-kb SLC18A2 promoter region in 23
Caucasian individuals and identified 47 polymorphisms that conferred 13
haplotypes. In vitro analysis showed a 20% difference in promoter
activity between 2 frequent haplotypes and identified some of the SNPs
that influenced promoter activity. In 144 alcoholic patients and 189
controls, they found that haplotypes with -14234G (dbSNP rs363371) and
-2504C of the SLC18A2 promoter region represented a protective factor
against alcoholism (p = 0.0038).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Li et al. (1998) used the adenovirus E3-14.7K protein to screen a HeLa
cell cDNA library to search for interacting proteins in the yeast
2-hybrid system. They identified a protein, which they named FIP2
(14.7K-interacting protein) with multiple leucine zipper domains. Li et
al. (1998) identified 3 major mRNA forms of FIP2 in multiple human
tissues and found that expression of the transcripts was induced by
TNF-alpha (191160) treatment in a time-dependent manner in 2 different
cell lines. They concluded that FIP2 is one of the cellular targets for
adenovirus E3-14.7K and that its mechanism of affecting cell death
involves the TNF receptor (191190), RIP (603453), or a downstream
molecule affected by either of these 2 molecules.

Moreland et al. (2000) cloned the same gene, which they called
transcription factor IIIA-interacting protein. The rat TF3A-intP has 85%
identity with the human sequence, including 100% identity over a
leucine-rich, 36-amino acid stretch. The full-length 617-amino acid
protein has a molecular mass of 70.6 kD, numerous leucine zippers and
other leucine-rich regions, and contains a potential cys2-his-cys zinc
finger at residues 553-582.

Schwamborn et al. (2000) also cloned the optineurin gene, which they
called NRP (NEMO-related protein), by searching databases for cDNAs with
strong homology to NEMO (300248). They determined that NRP is a 67-kD
protein with 53% amino acid identity to NEMO and that it is present in a
novel high molecular weight complex that contains none of the known
members of the IKK complex. They demonstrated that de novo expression of
NRP can be induced by interferon and TNF-alpha and that these 2 stimuli
have a synergistic effect on NRP expression. They further demonstrated
that NRP is associated with the Golgi apparatus.

Li et al. (1998) found gene expression of FIP2 in heart, brain,
placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. By RT-PCR,
Rezaie et al. (2002) found further expression in human trabecular
meshwork, nonpigmented ciliary epithelium, retina, brain, adrenal
cortex, liver, fetus, lymphocyte, and fibroblast. Northern blot analysis
revealed a major 2.0-kb transcript in human trabecular meshwork and
nonpigmented ciliary epithelium and a minor 3.6-kb message that was 3 to
4 times less abundant. Optineurin expression was also detected in
aqueous humor samples of human, macaque, cow, pig, goat, sheep, cat, and
rabbit, suggesting that it is a secreted protein. Rezaie et al. (2002)
showed by immunocytochemistry that optineurin is localized to the Golgi
apparatus.

Wild et al. (2011) reported that the 577-amino acid human OPTN protein
contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, followed by an LC3 (MAP1LC3A;
601242)-interacting motif (LIR), 2 more coiled-coil domains, a
ubiquitin-binding motif (UBAN), and a C-terminal zinc finger domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Optineurin has been shown to interact with huntingtin (HTT; 613004)
(Faber et al., 1998), transcription factor IIIA (Moreland et al., 2000),
and RAB8 (165040) (Hattula and Peranen, 2000).

Rezaie et al. (2002) found that the optineurin gene is mutated in
adult-onset primary open angle glaucoma (POAG; 137760). Linkage analysis
had shown that a locus for POAG resided on chromosome 10p15-p14
(Sarfarazi et al., 1998). Optineurin was a logical candidate gene on the
basis of its physical location on chromosome 10 and its expression in
retina.

Vittitow and Borras (2002) studied the effect of glaucomatous insults on
the expression of OPTN in human eyes maintained in organ culture.
Sustained elevated intraocular pressure, TNF-alpha exposure, and
prolonged dexamethasone treatment all significantly upregulated OPTN
expression. Vittitow and Borras (2002) concluded that these results
support the protective role of OPTN in the trabecular meshwork.

Chalasani et al. (2007) explored functional features of optineurin and
its mutants. The E50K mutation (602432.0001) acquired the ability to
induce cell death selectively in retinal ganglion cells. This cell death
was mediated by oxidative stress.

Park et al. (2007) studied the relationship between 2 glaucoma-related
genes, OPTN and MYOC (601652). MYOC overexpression had no effect on OPTN
expression, but OPTN overexpression upregulated endogenous MYOC in human
trabecular meshwork cells. This induction was also observed in other
ocular and nonocular cell types, including rat PC12 pheochromocytoma
cells. Endogenous levels of both Optn and Myoc were increased in PC12
cells following NGF (see 162030)-induced neuronal differentiation.
Overexpressed OPTN, which localized to the cytoplasm, prolonged the
turnover rate of MYOC mRNA, but it had little effect on MYOC promoter
activity. Park et al. (2007) concluded that OPTN has a role in
stabilizing MYOC mRNA.

Li et al. (2008) showed that TNF-alpha, which is found in cystic fluid
of humans with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD; see
173900), disrupted the localization of polycystin-2 (PKD2; 173910) to
the plasma membrane and primary cilia through the TNF-alpha-induced
scaffold protein FIP2. Treatment of mouse embryonic kidney organ
cultures with TNF-alpha resulted in cyst formation, and this effect was
exacerbated in Pkd2 +/- kidneys. TNF-alpha also stimulated cyst
formation in vivo in Pkd2 +/- mice, and treatment of Pkd2 +/- mice with
a TNF-alpha inhibitor prevented cyst formation.

Using yeast 2-hybrid screens, Morton et al. (2008) identified TANK
(603893)-binding kinase-1 (TBK1; 604834) as a binding partner for
optineurin; the interaction was confirmed by
overexpression/immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells and by
coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous OPTN and TBK1 from cell extracts. A
TBK1-binding site was detected between residues 1 and 127 of optineurin;
residues 78 through 121 were found to display striking homology to the
TBK1-binding domain of TANK. The OPTN-binding domain was localized to
residues 601 to 729 of TBK1; residues 1 to 688 of TBK1, which do not
bind to TANK, did not interact with OPTN. The E50K OPTN mutant
(602432.0001), known to cause open angle glaucoma (GLC1E; 137760),
displayed markedly enhanced binding to TBK1, suggesting that this
interaction may contribute to familial glaucoma caused by this mutation.

Wild et al. (2011) reported that phosphorylation of human OPTN promoted
selective autophagy of ubiquitin-coated cytosolic Salmonella enterica.
Phosphorylation on ser177 by TBK1 (604834) enhanced LC3 binding affinity
and autophagic clearance of cytosolic Salmonella. On the other hand,
ubiquitin- or LC3-binding mutants of OPTN or silencing of OPTN or TBK1
impaired Salmonella autophagy, leading to increased intracellular
bacterial proliferation. Wild et al. (2011) proposed that
phosphorylation of autophagy receptors, such as OPTN, may be a general
mechanism for regulation of cargo-selective autophagy.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rezaie et al. (2002) reported that the optineurin gene contains 3
noncoding exons in the 5-prime untranslated region and 13 exons that
code for a 577-amino acid protein. Alternative splicing at the 5-prime
UTR generates at least 3 different isoforms, but all have the same
reading frame. The mouse Optn gene codes for a 584-amino acid protein
(67 kD) that has 78% identity with human optineurin.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the OPTN
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP stSG3281).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Primary Open Angle Glaucoma

In patients with adult-onset primary open angle glaucoma (GLC1E;
137760), Rezaie et al. (2002) identified heterozygous mutations in the
OPTN gene (602432.0001-602432.0004). One of the mutations (602432.0004)
was also found to be associated with normal tension glaucoma
(602432.0004).

Because normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is the most frequent form of
glaucoma in Japan, Tang et al. (2003) sought mutations in the OPTN gene
in 148 unrelated Japanese patients with NTG as well as 165 patients with
POAG and 196 unrelated controls without glaucoma. No disease-causing
mutations were identified in these individuals.

Funayama et al. (2004) demonstrated that the OPTN gene was associated
with POAG rather than NTG in Japanese. Their statistical analyses showed
a possible interaction between polymorphisms in the OPTN and the tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF; 191160) genes that would increase the risk
for the development and probably the progression of glaucoma in Japanese
patients with POAG.

- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Maruyama et al. (2010) identified 2 different homozygous null mutations
in the OPTN gene, one a deletion of exon 5 (602432.0005) and the other a
nonsense mutation (602432.0006) in 4 Japanese individuals with autosomal
recessive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS12; 613435). These mutations
were not identified in over 6,800 individuals with glaucoma. In
addition, Maruyama et al. (2010) identified a missense mutation, E478G
(602432.0007), segregating as an apparently autosomal dominant mutation
with incomplete penetrance in 2 families. This mutation was not seen in
a total of 5,000 Japanese chromosomes. In cell transfection assays,
Maruyama et al. (2010) observed that nonsense and missense mutations of
OPTN abolished the inhibition of activation of nuclear factor kappa-B
(NFKB; see 164011) and that E478G mutant OPTN had a cytoplasmic
distribution different from that of wildtype OPTN or OPTN carrying a
mutation causing in POAG. A case with the E478G mutation showed
OPTN-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions. Furthermore, TDP43 (605078)-
or SOD1 (147450)-positive inclusions in sporadic and familial cases of
ALS were also noticeably immunolabeled by anti-OPTN antibodies.

Deng et al. (2011) observed OPTN-immunoreactive skeinlike inclusions in
anterior horn neurons and neurites in spinal cord sections from all 32
patients with sporadic ALS and in all 8 patients with familial ALS who
did not have mutations in the SOD1 gene. OPTN immunoreactivity was
absent in all 6 cases of familial ALS due to SOD1 mutations and in
tissue from 2 mouse models of ALS due to Sod1 mutations. The findings
suggested that OPTN may play a role in the pathogenesis of non-SOD1 ALS,
and that SOD1-linked ALS has a distinct disease pathogenesis.

- Paget Disease of Bone

For discussion of a possible association of variation in the OPTN gene
with susceptibility to Paget disease of bone, see 602080.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chi et al. (2010) described the phenotypic characteristics of transgenic
mice overexpressing wildtype or mutated optineurin. Mutations E50K
(602432.0001), H486R, and Optn with a deletion of the first or second
leucine zipper were used for overexpression. After 16 months, histologic
abnormalities were exclusively observed in the retina of E50K mutant
mice, with loss of retinal ganglion cells and connecting synapses in the
peripheral retina, thinning of the nerve fiber layer at the optic nerve
head at normal intraocular pressure, and massive apoptosis and
degeneration of the entire retina. Introduction of the E50K mutation
disrupted the interaction between Optn and Rab8 GTPase (RAB8A; 165040),
a protein involved in the regulation of vesicle transport from Golgi to
plasma membrane. Wiltype Optn and an active GTP-bound form of Rab8
colocalized to the Golgi. Chi et al. (2010) concluded that alteration of
the Optn sequence can initiate significant retinal degeneration in mice.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLAUCOMA 1, OPEN ANGLE, E
OPTN, GLU50LYS

In affected members of a family segregating adult-onset open angle
glaucoma (137760), Rezaie et al. (2002) identified a 458G-A transition
in the OPTN gene, resulting in a glu50-to-lys substitution. This
mutation was observed in 7 of 52 families, accounting for 13.5% of the
disease-causing alterations, and was not identified in any of 540 normal
chromosomes tested.

Rezaie et al. (2002) noted that 31 (81.6%) of the 38 glaucoma patients
carrying the recurrent E50K mutation had normal intraocular pressure
(IOP), ranging from 11 to 21 mm Hg, whereas the remaining 7 patients had
elevated IOP (23 to 26 mm Hg).

.0002
GLAUCOMA 1, OPEN ANGLE, E
OPTN, 2-BP INS, 691AG

In 1 of 46 families segregating adult-onset primary open angle glaucoma
(137760), Rezaie et al. (2002) identified a frameshift mutation in exon
6 of the OPTN gene, an insertion of AG between nucleotides 691 and 692.
This mutation was observed in 2.2% of the families studied and was not
seen in any of 200 normal chromosomes tested.

.0003
GLAUCOMA 1, OPEN ANGLE, E
OPTN, ARG545GLN

In 1 of 46 families segregating adult-onset primary open angle glaucoma
(137760), Rezaie et al. (2002) identified a 1944G-A transition in exon
16 of the OPTN gene, resulting in an arg545-to-glu substitution. This
mutation was not identified in any of 100 normal chromosomes tested.

.0004
GLAUCOMA, NORMAL TENSION, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
GLAUCOMA 1, OPEN ANGLE, E, INCLUDED
OPTN, MET98LYS

Within a group of 169 subjects with adult-onset open angle glaucoma
(137760), Rezaie et al. (2002) identified a 603T-A transversion in exon
5 of the OPTN gene, resulting in a met98-to-lys substitution in 8 of 45
familial (17.8%) and 15 of 124 (12.1%) sporadic individuals with
glaucoma. Most of these individuals had normal intraocular pressure
(606657) and were screened for sequence changes in exon 5 only. This
mutation was also identified in 9 of 422 normal chromosomes, giving the
overall identification in an at-risk population of 13.6% versus 2.1% in
the general population, and making this a risk-associated alteration.

.0005
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 12
OPTN, DEL EXON 5

In 2 sibs with autosomal recessive ALS (ALS12; 613435) from a
consanguineous Japanese family, Maruyama et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for deletion of exon 5 of the OPTN gene. The deletion
resulted from an Alu-mediated recombination.

.0006
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 12
OPTN, GLN398TER

In a Japanese woman with ALS (ALS12; 613435) who was the child of a
consanguineous union, Maruyama et al. (2010) identified a homozygosity
for a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1502 of the OPTN gene, resulting
in a glutamine-to-nonsense substitution at codon 398 (Q398X). In a
separate analysis, Maruyama et al. (2010) found this mutation in
homozygosity in an apparently sporadic case. The probands of the 2
families were not related according to their family history but were
found to share haplotypes for a 0.9-Mb region around the OPTN gene,
suggesting that inheritance of the mutation from a common ancestor was
likely. This mutation was not detected in 781 healthy Japanese
volunteers as well as in over 6,800 individuals enrolled in glaucoma
studies, where the entire coding region of the gene was sequenced.

.0007
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS 12
OPTN, GLU478GLY

In 4 individuals with ALS (ALS12; 613435) from 2 families, Maruyama et
al. (2010) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the OPTN gene,
an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 1743 in exon 14 resulting in a
glutamic acid-to-glycine substitution at codon 478 (E478G). Two of the
subjects were sisters, and the pedigree suggested that the mutation
resulted in an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. In
the second family, the sibs were brothers. Although the 2 families were
not known to be related, all affected individuals shared their haplotype
for 2.3 megabases on chromosome 10 around the OPTN gene.

614215	TITLE *614215 ACTIVATING SIGNAL COINTEGRATOR 1 COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 1; ASCC1
;;ASC1 COMPLEX, 50-KD SUBUNIT;;
p50
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing peptides that copurified with the 650-kD ASC1 (TRIP4;
604501) complex from HeLa cells, followed by database analysis and PCR
of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Jung et al. (2002) cloned ASCC1, which they
designated p50. The deduced 357-amino acid protein contains a KH-type
RNA-binding motif near its N terminus. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of an approximately 2.1-kb transcript in all tissues
examined. P50 localized to both nuclei and cytoplasm of HeLa cells.
Database analysis revealed orthologs of p50 in mouse, fly, frog, and
nematode.

GENE FUNCTION

Jung et al. (2002) identified a 650-kD protein complex containing ASC1,
p50, p100 (ASCC2; 614216), and p200 (ASCC3; 614217). Immunodepletion of
p50 from HeLa cell nuclear extracts almost completely eliminated phorbol
ester-induced AP1 (see 165160) transactivation of a reporter gene. Yeast
2-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation of in vitro-translated
proteins, and protein pull-down experiments confirmed direct interaction
between p50 and p200. Domain analysis revealed that the KH motif of p50
was required its interaction with p200.

Gastrin (GAS; 137250) regulates the expression of a variety of genes
involved in the control of acid secretion. It also triggers tissue
response to damage, infection, and inflammation in cells expressing
gastrin receptor (CCKBR; 118445) and, indirectly, in nearby cells via a
paracrine mechanism. Almeida-Vega et al. (2009) found that gastrin
directly induced upregulation of the antiapoptotic regulator PAI2
(SERPINB2; 173390) in CCKBR-positive cells. CCKBR-positive cells also
released IL8 (146930) and prostaglandin E2 into the culture medium in
response to gastrin, which resulted in elevated PAI2 expression in
cocultured CCKBR-negative cells. IL8 signaling in CCKBR-negative cells
upregulated PAI2 via binding of the ASC1 complex to the PAI2 promoter.
Prostaglandin E2 independently upregulated PAI2 via RHOA
(165390)-dependent signaling that induced binding of MAZ (600999) to the
PAI2 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that MAZ and the p50 subunit of
the ASC1 complex bound directly to sites in the PAI2 promoter. Mutation
of the putative MAZ site in the PAI2 promoter reduced responses to RHOA.
Knockdown of the p50 or p65 (TRIP4) subunits of the ASC1 complex via
small interfering RNA significantly reduced PAI2 upregulation in
response to gastrin.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ASCC1 gene to chromosome 10q22.1 based on an
alignment of the ASCC1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF132952) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Orloff et al. (2011) identified a germline asn290-to-ser (N290S;
614215.0001) mutation in the ASCC1 gene in 2 (2.1%) of 116 patients of
European descent with Barrett esophagus and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma
(614266). The mutation was not found in 125 controls. This genomic
region was studied after being identified by genomewide linkage analysis
of 21 concordant and 11 discordant sib pairs with the disorders.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The high affinity IgE receptor is responsible for initiating the
allergic response. Binding of allergen to receptor-bound IgE leads to
cell activation and the release of mediators (such as histamine)
responsible for the manifestations of allergy. The receptor is a
tetrameric complex composed of an alpha chain (147140), a beta chain,
and 2 disulfide-linked gamma chains (147139). It is found on the surface
of mast cells and basophils. The alpha and beta subunits have not been
detected in other hematopoietic cells, although the gamma chains are
found in macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and T cells where they
associate with the low affinity receptor for IgG or with the T-cell
antigen receptor. The molecular cloning of subunits permitted the
reconstitution of surface-expressed receptor complexes by transfection.
Cotransfection of all 3 chains--alpha, beta, and gamma--was required for
efficient surface expression of the rat or mouse receptor. By contrast,
surface expression of the human alpha-gamma complex was achieved by
cotransfecting alpha and gamma alone, suggesting that beta is not
necessary. To study the expression of the beta gene, Kuster et al.
(1992) isolated and characterized the gene and its cDNA. Analysis of the
surface expression of transfected receptors indicated that human
alpha-gamma and alpha-beta-gamma complexes are expressed with comparable
efficiency.

Donnadieu et al. (2003) noted that the FCER1 tetrameric complex is
expressed on mast cells and basophils, whereas the FCER1 trimeric
complex lacking the beta subunit is expressed on Langerhan cells,
dendritic cells, and monocytes. Thus, beta chain expression correlates
with allergy mediator release, while the trimeric FCER1 form is
associated with antigen presentation. The presence of the beta chain
amplifies FCER1 surface expression and signaling capacity, and the beta
chain acts as a chaperone for transporting the FCER1 complex to the cell
surface. By RT-PCR of basophil RNA, Donnadieu et al. (2003) cloned an
FCER1B splice variant that retains intron 5 and encodes a truncated
protein, designated beta(T). The fourth transmembrane domain and the
C-terminal tail of the full-length beta form are deleted and replaced
with 16 novel amino acids in beta(T). The beta(T) variant was also
present in cord blood mast cells, but not in a monocyte cell line.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses showed that beta(T) was
expressed as a 21-kD protein, whereas the full-length form was 28 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using transfection experiments, Donnadieu et al. (2003) showed that the
beta(T) isoform competed with the full-length beta isoform and
diminished FCER1 expression by preventing alpha chain maturation.
Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that beta(T) associated with
immature alpha chains, but not with mature alpha chains or gamma chains.
Donnadieu et al. (2003) proposed that the relative abundance of the beta
and beta(T) isoforms may control the level of surface FCER1 expression
and influence susceptibility to allergic disease.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kuster et al. (1992) determined that the gene encoding the human high
affinity IgE receptor beta chain spans about 10 kb and contains 7 exons.
There is a single transcription initiation site preceded by a TATA box.
The human beta gene appears to be present in single copy.

MAPPING

By linkage studies using a CA microsatellite repeat in the fifth intron
of the FCER1B gene, Sandford et al. (1993) demonstrated that the gene is
located on 11q13. Using in situ hybridization and pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis, Szepetowski and Gaudray (1994) likewise mapped the
FCER1B gene to chromosome 11q at a site centromeric from CD20 (112210)
at 11q13 and in the same 550 kb fragment as TCN1 (189905), thought to be
on 11q11-q12, and OSBP (167040), thought to be on 11q12-q13.

The gene for the mouse beta subunit was localized to chromosome 19 by
genetic linkage studies (Hupp et al., 1989) and was thought to be a
single gene. The genes for the alpha and gamma subunits are both located
on human and mouse chromosome 1 (Kuster et al., 1992).

- Linkage to Atopy

Sandford et al. (1993) demonstrated that the FCER1B gene is linked to
clinical atopy (147050). In their linkage study of atopy, Sandford et
al. (1993) used only maternally derived alleles; paternally derived
alleles failed to show linkage. The known roles of the high affinity IgE
receptor in antigen-induced mast cell degranulation and in the release
of cytokines that enhance IgE production, taken with the location in the
same region, 11q13, made the FCER1B gene a candidate for the chromosome
11 atopy locus.

Folster-Holst et al. (1998) presented evidence from linkage studies in
12 families with atopic dermatitis for linkage in close proximity to the
marker D11S903. The method of analysis suggested an oligogenic mode of
inheritance as well as heterogeneity in the genetic susceptibility to
atopy and atopic dermatitis; only 2 of 12 families showed evidence for
linkage using the oligogenic model.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shirakawa et al. (1994) reported a significant association between atopy
and substitution of a leucine for an isoleucine at position 181 of the
FCER1B gene product. Hizawa et al. (1995) failed to find this
leu181-to-ile substitution.

Hill and Cookson (1996) identified a novel coding polymorphism in exon 7
of the beta subunit of the high affinity receptor for IgE. An A-to-G
transition changes glutamic acid-237 to glycine (147138.0001). The
substitution occurs adjacent to the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation
motif (ITAM). This E237G mutation was detected in 53 subjects from a
general Australian population of 1004 (5.3%). E237G subjects had a
significantly elevated skin test response to grass (p = 0.0004) and
house dust mite (p = 0.04), RAST to grass (p = 0.0020), and bronchial
reactivity to methacholine (p = 0.0009). Hill and Cookson (1996)
reported that the relative risk of individuals with E237G having asthma
compared to subjects without the variant was 2.3.

Traherne et al. (2003) performed association studies between FCER1B SNPs
and atopy in 2 Caucasian cohorts. Independent clusters of SNPs within an
18-kb region affected prick skin tests and specific IgE responses.
Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2; 147576) sites were altered by
significantly associated SNPs in 2 regions. Strong association to
maternally derived alleles was seen in 1 panel of subjects and not in
the other. Two regions of increased CpG concentration were identified in
FCER1B, providing a potential substrate for epigenetic effects.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ATOPIC ASTHMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MS4A2, GLU237GLY

Hill and Cookson (1996) found this exon 7 E237G polymorphism in 53 of
1004 Australian subjects studied (5.3%). E237G subjects had elevated
reactions to a number of common measures of atopy and bronchial
hyperresponsiveness. The investigators also found that the relative risk
for E237G individuals having asthma compared to those without the allele
was 2.3.

Shirakawa et al. (1996) reported that the gly237 form of the IgE Fc
receptor was associated with atopic asthma (odds ratio = 3.00,
chi-square = 5.10, p less than 0.03) and with elevated serum IgE levels
(odds ratio = 8.56) in the Japanese population. This association was
particularly noted in childhood asthma (odds ratio = 3.92, chi-square =
8.66, p less than 0.005).

Among 333 Japanese subjects, including 233 with nasal allergy and 100
controls, Nagata et al. (2001) observed a significant relationship
between gly237 and elevated levels of serum total IgE and very high IgE.
The findings suggested that the glu237-to-gly variant of the FCER1B gene
is involved in the development of nasal allergy through the process for
the production of both specific and nonspecific IgE antibodies.

TCP1 RING COMPLEX, POLYPEPTIDE 5; TRIC5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Molecular chaperones are proteins capable of folding or assembling
nascent proteins in a higher order structure. A molecular chaperone
called TCP1 ring complex (TRiC) plays a role in actin and tubulin
folding. TRiC is composed of 2 heteromeric subunits of 6 to 9 different
proteins. The cytoplasmic T-complex protein-1 (TCP1; 186980), an
abundant testicular germ cell protein, has been found in this complex.
Other components of TRiC, such as TRIC5, are TCP1-related proteins
(Sevigny et al., 1994).

CLONING

Joly et al. (1994) cloned a mouse cDNA corresponding to tryptic
fragments of the bovine TRiCP5 subunit described by Frydman et al.
(1992). The mouse TRiCP5 shares 48% nucleotide and 34% amino acid
homology with mouse Tcp1. It is a cytosolic protein also found in the
nuclear matrix of several cultured human cell lines. Furthermore, like
TCP1, it is highly expressed in testis.

Sevigny et al. (1994) cloned a partial human cDNA clone homologous to
mouse TRiCP5.

Walkley et al. (1996) cloned the human cDNA from a kidney library. The
1.9-kb cDNA encodes a predicted 544-amino acid protein that is 98%
similar to the mouse sequence and 75% similar to the yeast gene. The
mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues and at high levels in
mouse testis.

Sevigny et al. (1996) cloned the gene coding for the mouse P5 subunit.

GENE FUNCTION

Feldman et al. (1999) demonstrated that the folding and assembly of the
VHL protein (608537) into a complex with its partner proteins, elongin B
(600787) and elongin C (600788), is directly mediated by the chaperonin
TRiC. Their results defined a novel role for TRiC in mediating
oligomerization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sevigny et al. (1996) determined that the mouse Tric5 gene contains 14
exons distributed within 25 kb of genomic DNA. Sevigny et al. (1996)
used primer extension to demonstrate multiple transcription start points
for the Tric5 gene. This was considered consistent with the lack of any
obvious TATA box upstream of the transcription start points.

MAPPING

Sevigny et al. (1994) mapped the TRIC5 gene to chromosome 1q23 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. The fact that the human TRIC5 gene
is not on chromosome 6 like other TCP1-related proteins implied to
Sevigny et al. (1994) that the genes coding the TCP1-related proteins
present in the TCP1 ring complex are probably not organized in a cluster
and thus are not synchronously regulated by a cis-acting control region
such as the LCR involved in the regulation of globin synthesis.

Sevigny et al. (1996) showed that the mouse genome contains 1 Tric5 gene
and 1 Tric5 pseudogene located on chromosomes 3F and 5B, respectively.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CD40 (109535) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)
family. The short cytoplasmic domain of CD40 contains a region with
limited homology to the conserved cytosolic death domain of TNFR1
(191190) and FAS (134637). Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay with the
cytoplasmic domain of CD40 as bait, Hu et al. (1994) isolated B-cell
cDNAs encoding a protein that they called CD40-binding protein (CD40bp).
The predicted CD40bp protein contains a RING finger DNA-binding motif, a
cys/his-rich region, and a coiled-coil domain. Like TRAF1 (601711) and
TRAF2 (601895), both TNFR2 (75-kD TNFR; 191191)-binding proteins, CD40bp
contains a C-terminal TRAF domain. In vitro translated CD40bp has an
apparent molecular mass of 64 kD. Coimmunoprecipitation studies
indicated that CD40bp interacts with CD40 in human B cells. Hu et al.
(1994) suggested that CD40bp, along with TRAF1 and TRAF2, comprise a
family of proteins that associate with the cytoplasmic faces of the TNFR
family and have in common a TRAF domain.

Independently, Sato et al. (1995) and Cheng et al. (1995) identified
CD40bp, designating it CAP1 (CD40-associated protein-1) and CRAF1 (CD40
receptor-associated factor 1), respectively. Sato et al. (1995)
demonstrated that CAP1 binds specifically to the cytoplasmic domain of
CD40, but not to that of TNFR1, TNFR2, or FAS. The C-terminal TRAF
domain of CAP1 was sufficient to mediate binding to CD40 and
homodimerization. Cheng et al. (1995) isolated mouse and human CRAF1
cDNAs. The predicted 568-amino acid human protein is 96% identical to
mouse CRAF1. These authors divided the TRAF domain into 2 regions:
TRAF-N, the more N-terminal coiled-coil subdomain, and TRAF-C, which was
necessary and sufficient for CRAF1 to interact with CD40. Overexpression
of a truncated cDNA encoding the entire TRAF domain of CRAF1 inhibited
CD40-mediated upregulation of the CD23 (151445) gene, which suggested to
Cheng et al. (1995) that CRAF1 participates in CD40 signaling.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the TRAF3 gene to chromosome 14q32.32 based on an
alignment of the TRAF3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC075086) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

The cytoplasmic C terminus of the Epstein-Barr virus latent infection
membrane protein-1 (LMP1) is essential for B lymphocyte growth
transformation. LMP1 is an integral membrane protein that has
transforming effects in nonlymphoid cells, and may act by constitutively
activating a common cellular growth factor receptor pathway. Mosialos et
al. (1995) found that CD40bp, which they called LAP1 (LMP1-associated
protein-1), interacted with the LMP1 C-terminal domain. Expression of
LMP1 caused LAP1 and TRAF1 (EBI6) to localize to LMP1 clusters in
lymphoblast plasma membranes, and LMP1 coimmunoprecipitated with these
proteins in cell extracts. LAP1 bound to the cytoplasmic domains of CD40
and LT-beta-R (600979) in vitro, and associated with p80 (TNFR2) in
vivo. Northern blot analysis revealed that LAP1 was expressed as a
full-length 2.8-kb mRNA and an alternatively spliced 1.8-kb mRNA in all
tissues tested. Mosialos et al. (1995) concluded that the interaction of
LAP1 with LMP1 and with the cytoplasmic domains of TNFR family members
is evidence for a central role of this protein as an effector of cell
growth or death signaling pathways.

Dadgostar et al. (2003) determined that the coiled-coil domain of mouse
T3jam (608255) interacted with the isoleucine zipper domain of Traf3.
T3jam did not associate with other Traf family members. Coexpression of
T3jam and Traf3 recruited Traf3 to the detergent-insoluble fraction, and
T3jam and Traf3 synergistically activated JNK (601158), but not nuclear
factor kappa-B (see 164011).

To dissect biochemically Toll-like receptor signaling, Hacker et al.
(2006) established a system for isolating signaling complexes assembled
by dimerized adaptors. Using MyD88 (602170) as a prototypic adaptor,
they identified TRAF3 as a new component of Toll/interleukin-1 receptor
signaling complexes that is recruited along with TRAF6 (602355). Using
myeloid cells from Traf3- and Traf6-deficient mice, Hacker et al. (2006)
demonstrated that TRAF3 is essential for the induction of type I
interferons and the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL10;
124092), but is dispensable for expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
In fact, Traf3-deficient cells overproduced proinflammatory cytokines
owing to defective Il10 production. Despite their structural similarity,
the functions of TRAF3 and TRAF6 are largely distinct. TRAF3 is also
recruited to the adaptor TRIF (607601) and is required for marshalling
the protein kinase TBK1 (604834) into Toll/interleukin-1 receptor
signaling complexes, thereby explaining its unique role in activation of
the interferon response.

Oganesyan et al. (2006) demonstrated that cells lacking TRAF3 are
defective in type I interferon responses activated by several different
Toll-like receptors. Furthermore, they showed that TRAF3 associates with
the Toll-like receptor adaptors TRIF and IRAK1 (300283), as well as
downstream IRF3/7 kinases TBK1 and IKK-epsilon (605048), suggesting that
TRAF3 serves as a critical link between Toll-like receptor adaptors and
downstream regulatory kinases important for IRF activation. In addition
to TLR stimulation, Oganesyan et al. (2006) showed that TRAF3-deficient
fibroblasts are defective in their type I interferon response to direct
infection with vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating that TRAF3 is also
an important component of TLR-independent viral recognition pathways.
Oganesyan et al. (2006) concluded that TRAF3 is a major regulator of
type I interferon production and the innate antiviral response.

Production of type I interferon is a critical host defense triggered by
pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system.
Kayagaki et al. (2007) demonstrated that reduction of DUBA (300713)
augmented the PRR-induced type I interferon response in transfected
HEK293 cells, whereas ectopic expression of DUBA had the converse
effect. DUBA bound TRAF3, an adaptor protein essential for type I
interferon response. TRAF3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that preferentially
assembled lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains in cotransfection assays.
DUBA selectively cleaved the lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3,
resulting in its dissociation from the downstream signaling complex
containing TBK1. A discrete ubiquitin interaction motif within DUBA was
required for efficient deubiquitination of TRAF3 and optimal suppression
of type I interferon. Kayagaki et al. (2007) concluded that their data
identified DUBA as a negative regulator of innate immune responses.

Cytokine signaling is thought to require assembly of multicomponent
signaling complexes at cytoplasmic segments of membrane-embedded
receptors, in which receptor-proximal protein kinases are activated.
Matsuzawa et al. (2008) reported that, upon ligation, CD40 formed a
complex containing adaptor molecules TRAF2 and TRAF3,
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 (UBE2N; 603679), cellular inhibitor
of apoptosis protein-1 (CIAP1, or BIRC2; 601712) and -2 (CIAP2, or
BIRC3; 601721), IKK-gamma (IKBKG; 300248), and MEKK1 (MAP3K1; 600982).
TRAF2, UBC13, and IKK-gamma were required for complex assembly and
activation of MEKK1 and MAP kinase cascades. However, the kinases were
not activated unless the complex was translocated from the membrane to
the cytosol upon CIAP1/CIAP2-induced degradation of TRAF3. Matsuzawa et
al. (2008) proposed that this 2-stage signaling mechanism may apply to
other innate immune receptors and may account for spatial and temporal
separation of MAPK and IKK signaling.

Hu et al. (2013) identified the deubiquitinase OTUD7B (611748) as a
pivotal regulator of the noncanonical NF-kappa-B pathway. OTUD7B
deficiency in mice has no appreciable effect on canonical NF-kappa-B
activation but causes hyperactivation of noncanonical NF-kappa-B. In
response to noncanonical NF-kappa-B stimuli, OTUD7B binds and
deubiquitinates TRAF3, thereby inhibiting TRAF3 proteolysis and
preventing aberrant noncanonical NF-kappa-B activation. Consequently,
the OTUD7B deficiency results in B-cell hyperresponsiveness to antigens,
lymphoid follicular hyperplasia in the intestinal mucosa, and elevated
host-defense ability against an intestinal bacterial pathogen,
Citrobacter rodentium. Hu et al. (2013) concluded that their findings
established OTUD7B as a crucial regulator of signal-induced noncanonical
NF-kappa-B activation, and indicated a mechanism of immune regulation
that involves OTUD7B-mediated deubiquitination and stabilization of
TRAF3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Braggio et al. (2009) identified biallelic inactivation of TRAF3 in 3
(5.3%) of 57 Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM; see 153600) samples.
TRAF3 inactivation was associated with transcriptional activation of
NF-kappa-B (NFKB1; 164011). In addition, 1 of 24 patients with a 6q
deletion had an inactivating somatic mutation in TNFAIP3 (191163),
another negative regulator of NF-kappa-B. Monoallelic deletions of
chromosome 6q23, including the TNFAIP3 gene, were identified in 38% of
patients, suggesting that haploinsufficiency can predispose to the
development of WM. The results indicated that mutational activation of
the NF-kappa-B pathway plays a role in the pathogenesis of WM.

Perez de Diego et al. (2010) investigated an 18-year-old French female
who had suffered from herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE; 614849) at age 4
years and who lacked mutations in either the UNC93B1 (608204) or TLR3
(603029) genes. They identified a heterozygous C-to-T substitution at
position 352 in exon 4 of the TRAF3 gene, resulting in a nonconservative
missense change, arg118 to trp (R118W; 601896.0001). The mutation was
not found in her parents or brothers, and none had a history of HSE.
RT-PCR analysis of the patient's cells detected normal levels of TRAF3
mRNA, but Western blot analysis showed severely reduced levels of TRAF3
protein. Responsiveness to TLR3 agonists was impaired, as indicated by
deficient NFKB activation and poor production of IFNB (147640), IFNL
(IL29; 607403), and IL6 (147620). Expression of wildtype and mutant
alleles in cell lines showed that the mutant was dominant-negative.
TRAF3-deficient fibroblasts had impaired type I and type III
IFN-dependent control of viruses and deficient responses through the
TNFR (e.g., TNFRSF5; 109535) pathways. Perez de Diego et al. (2010)
concluded that, whereas complete Traf3 deficiency is neonatal lethal in
mice, decreases in TRAF3 production and function result in
predisposition to HSE, a condition that is usually fatal if untreated.

Perez de Diego et al. (2010) reported a female French patient with
herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE; 614849) at age 4 years who was healthy
without prophylaxis and showed normal resistance to other infectious
diseases, including other herpesvirus family members, at age 18 years.
They identified a de novo heterozygous 352C-T transition in exon 4 of
the TRAF3 gene, resulting in an arg118-to-trp (R118W) substitution, in
this patient, whose HSE was successfully treated with acyclovir for 3
weeks.

146680	TITLE *146680 INSULIN-DEGRADING ENZYME; IDE
;;INSULYSIN;;
INSULINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Insulin-degrading enzyme (EC 3.4.24.56), also known as insulysin, is a
110-kD neutral metallopeptidase that can degrade a number of peptides,
including insulin (176730) and beta-amyloid (104760) (Qiu et al., 1998).

CLONING

Affholter et al. (1988) isolated and sequenced a cDNA coding for IDE.
The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme contained the sequences of
13 peptides derived from the isolated protein. The cDNA transcribed in
vitro yielded a synthetic RNA that in cell-free translations produced a
protein that coelectrophoresed with the native proteinase and could be
immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies to IDE. Since the deduced
sequence of this proteinase did not contain the consensus sequences for
any of the known classes of proteinases (i.e., metallo, cysteine,
aspartic, or serine), it may be a member of a family of proteases that
are involved in intercellular peptide signaling. It did show homology to
an Escherichia coli proteinase (called protease III), which also cleaves
insulin and is present in the periplasmic space; thus, they may be
members of the same family of proteases.

GENE FUNCTION

Qiu et al. (1998) determined that the extracellular thiol
metalloprotease capable of degrading amyloid-beta protein identified by
Qiu et al. (1997) is the same as IDE. By Western blot analysis, they
found a full-length 110-kD IDE band in the CSF of normal individuals and
of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) or non-Alzheimer
dementia. They found no difference in IDE levels of the normal and
patient populations. By biochemical analysis of IDE purified from the
medium of a mouse microglial cell line, they determined that IDE could
degrade both endogenous and synthetic amyloid-beta protein and that it
could catalyze the oligomerization of this protein.

Through a series of inhibitor studies, in vitro translation, and
biochemical assays of rat IDE expressed by transfected human kidney
cells, Edbauer et al. (2002) determined that IDE may be the protease
responsible for the clearance of the cytoplasmic fragment of the
amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) following liberation of the
amyloid-beta protein.

IDE has a preferential affinity for insulin such that the presence of
insulin will inhibit IDE-mediated degradation of other substances,
including beta-amyloid. Cook et al. (2003) found that hippocampal IDE
levels were reduced by approximately 50% in AD patients with the APOE4
(107741) allele compared to AD patients without the APOE4 allele and to
controls with or without the APOE4 allele. The findings suggested that
reduced IDE expression may be a risk factor for AD, and that IDE may
interact with APOE status to affect beta-amyloid metabolism.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles. While
varicella is likely spread as cell-free virus to susceptible hosts, the
virus is transmitted by cell-to-cell spread in the body and in vitro. Li
et al. (2006) found that the extracellular domain of IDE interacted with
VZV glycoprotein E (gE), a protein essential for viral infection.
Downregulation of IDE by small interfering RNA or blocking IDE with
antibody, with soluble IDE protein extracted from liver, or with
bacitracin inhibited VZV infection. Cell-to-cell spread of virus was
also impaired by blocking IDE. Transfection of cell lines impaired for
VZV infection with a plasmid expressing human IDE resulted in increased
entry and enhanced infection with cell-free and cell-associated virus.
Li et al. (2006) concluded that IDE is a cellular receptor for both
cell-free and cell-associated VZV.

MAPPING

Affholter et al. (1990) mapped the IDE gene to human chromosome 10 and
mouse chromosome 19 by hybridization of cDNA probes to human-rodent or
mouse-hamster somatic cell hybrids, respectively. By a combination of
somatic cell hybrid analysis and in situ hybridization, Espinosa et al.
(1991) localized the IDE gene to 10q23-q25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the IDE
gene and late-onset Alzheimer disease, see AD6 (605526), which maps to
chromosome 10q23-q25.

Abraham et al. (2001) analyzed all of the coding exons, untranslated
regions, and 1,000 bp of 5-prime flanking sequence of IDE by means of
denaturing HPLC and sequencing. They detected 8 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 3 were found at lower than 5% frequency.
None of them changed the amino acid sequence. Abraham et al. (2001)
found no significant association between any individual SNP and
late-onset AD (LOAD) or with any haplotypes. They concluded that IDE
does not make a substantial contribution to the etiology of late-onset
AD and therefore cannot account for the linkage between late-onset AD
and 10q.

Prince et al. (2003) used a SNP genetic association strategy to
investigate AD in relation to a 480-kb region encompassing IDE. They
interpreted the results as providing 'substantial' evidence that genetic
variation within or very close to IDE impacts both disease risk and
traits related to the severity of AD.

Risk for LOAD and plasma amyloid-beta levels (APP; 104760), an
intermediate phenotype for LOAD, show linkage to chromosome 10q.
Ertekin-Taner et al. (2004) reported pathogenic variants in the 276-kb
region of 10q harboring the IDE gene that influence intermediate DNA
phenotypes and risk for AD.

Bian et al. (2004) reported an association between a T/C polymorphism
(dbSNP rs4646953) in the 5-prime untranslated region of the the IDE
gene, and AD in Han Chinese patients with the APOE4 allele. They found
no association between several IDE polymorphisms and AD among patients
without the E4 allele.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Shen et al. (2006) reported the crystal structure of human IDE in
complex with 4 substrates, the insulin B chain (see 176730), amyloid
beta(1-40), amylin (147940), and glucagon (138030). The amino- and
carboxy-terminal domains of IDE form an enclosed cage just large enough
to encapsulate insulin. Extensive contacts between these domains keep
the degradation chamber of IDE inaccessible to substrates. Repositioning
of the IDE domains enables substrate access to the catalytic cavity. IDE
uses size and charge distribution of the substrate-binding cavity
selectively to entrap structurally diverse polypeptides. The enclosed
substrate undergoes conformational changes to form beta-sheets with 2
discrete regions of IDE for its degradation. Consistent with this model,
mutations disrupting the contacts between the amino- and carboxy-termini
of IDE increase IDE catalytic activity 40-fold.

ANIMAL MODEL

Genetic analysis of the diabetic GK rat has revealed several diabetes
susceptibility loci (see 125853). Fakhrai-Rad et al. (2000) mapped one
such locus, NIDDM1B, to a 1-cM region by genetic and pathophysiologic
characterization of new congenic substrains for the locus. The IDE gene
was also mapped to this 1-cM region, and 2 amino acid substitutions
(H18R and A890V) were identified in the GK allele which reduced
insulin-degrading activity by 31% in transfected cells. However, when
the H18R and A890V variants were studied separately, no effects were
observed, suggesting a synergistic effect of the 2 variants on insulin
degradation. No effect on insulin degradation was observed in cell
lysates, suggesting that the effect may be coupled to receptor-mediated
internalization of insulin. Congenic rats with the IDE GK allele
displayed postprandial hyperglycemia, reduced lipogenesis in fat cells,
blunted insulin-stimulated glucose transmembrane uptake, and reduced
insulin degradation in isolated muscle. Analysis of additional rat
strains demonstrated that the dysfunctional IDE allele was unique to GK
rats. The authors concluded that IDE plays an important role in the
diabetic phenotype in GK rats.

Factors that elevate amyloid-beta (104760) peptide levels are associated
with an increased risk for Alzheimer disease. Insulysin is one of
several proteases potentially involved in degradation of amyloid-beta,
based on its hydrolysis of amyloid-beta peptides in vitro. In an
insulysin-deficient gene-trap mouse model, Miller et al. (2003) found
that in vivo levels of brain A-beta-40 and A-beta-42 peptides were
increased significantly. A 6-fold increase in the level of the
gamma-secretase-generated C-terminal fragment of the A-beta precursor
protein also was found in the insulysin-deficient mouse. In mice
heterozygous for the insulysin gene trap, in which insulysin activity
levels were decreased approximately 50%, brain A-beta peptides were
increased to levels intermediate between those in wildtype mice and
homozygous insulysin gene-trap mice that had no detectable insulysin
activity. These findings indicated that there is an inverse correlation
between in vivo insulysin activity levels and brain A-beta peptide
levels and suggested that modulation of insulysin activity may alter the
risk for Alzheimer disease.

Farris et al. (2003) generated mice deficient in IDE by targeted
disruption. Ide deficiency resulted in a greater than 50% decrease in
amyloid-beta degradation in both membrane fractions and primary neuronal
cultures and a similar deficit in insulin degradation in liver. The
Ide-null mice showed increased cerebral accumulation of endogenous
amyloid-beta, a hallmark of Alzheimer disease, and had hyperinsulinemia
and glucose intolerance (see 176730), hallmarks of type II diabetes.
Moreover, the mice had elevated levels of the intracellular signaling
domain of the beta-amyloid precursor protein, which had recently been
found to be degraded by IDE in vitro. Farris et al. (2003) concluded
that, together with emerging genetic evidence, their in vivo findings
suggest that IDE hypofunction may underlie or contribute to some forms
of Alzheimer disease and type II diabetes and provide a mechanism for
the recognized association among hyperinsulinemia, diabetes, and
Alzheimer disease.

Leissring et al. (2003) found that developmentally delayed,
neuron-specific overexpression of Ide or neprilysin (MME; 120520) in
mice significantly reduced brain beta-amyloid levels, retarded or
prevented amyloid plaque formation and its associated cytopathology, and
rescued the premature lethality in APP transgenic mice. They concluded
that chronic upregulation of beta-amyloid-degrading proteases may combat
Alzheimer-type pathology in vivo.

603129	TITLE *603129 LIM DOMAIN ONLY 4; LMO4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The LIM domain, an approximately 55-residue cysteine-rich zinc-binding
motif, is present in a variety of proteins, including LIM homeobox
proteins that contain 2 LIM domains and 1 homeodomain. The nuclear
LIM-only proteins (e.g., LMO2; 180385) lack a DNA-binding homeodomain.
To identify novel LIM domain transcription factors, Kenny et al. (1998)
screened 2 mouse embryonic expression libraries using the LIM
interaction domain of the widely expressed nuclear LIM interactor (NLI,
or LDB1; 603451), to which the LIM domains of nuclear proteins bind with
high affinity. They reported the isolation and characterization of LMO4,
a novel LIM-only gene that is highly expressed in the T-lymphocyte
lineage, cranial neural crest cells, somite, dorsal limb bud mesenchyme,
motor neurons, and Schwann cell progenitors. LMO1 (186921), LMO2, and
LMO4 were found to have distinct expression patterns in adult tissue.
Mesenchymal and thymic blast cell expression patterns of LMO4 and LMO2
were consistent with the suggestion that LMO genes inhibit
differentiation.

Using autologous patient serum to screen a human breast tumor cDNA
expression library, followed by screening a testis cDNA library,
Racevskis et al. (1999) cloned LMO4. The 5-prime end of the transcript
is highly GC rich (74%), with some stretches exceeding 90%, and the
3-prime UTR contains an RNA destabilization motif. Except for a
proline-rich N terminus, the deduced 165-amino acid protein is composed
entirely of 2 tandem LIM domains. The mouse and human LMO4 proteins are
identical. Northern blot analysis detected LMO4 expression in most human
tissues analyzed, with highest levels in brain, skeletal muscle, testis,
and ovary. No expression was detected in liver, kidney, and pancreas.
The expression pattern was somewhat different than that found in mouse.

Using Northern blot analysis, Wittlin et al. (2003) detected LMO4
transcripts of about 2.1 and 2.3 kb in normal mammary epithelia and
breast cancer cell lines. A transcript of about 1.7 kb was also detected
in the cancer cell lines, but not in normal epithelial cells. The
variation in transcript size was due to different promoter usage and
splicing.

GENE FUNCTION

Visvader et al. (2001) explored a role for LMO4, initially described as
a human breast tumor autoantigen, in developing mammary epithelium and
breast oncogenesis. The gene was expressed predominantly in the
lobuloalveoli of the mammary gland during pregnancy. Consistent with a
role in proliferation, forced expression of this gene inhibited
differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. Overexpression of LMO4 mRNA
was observed in 5 of 10 human breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, in
situ hybridization analysis of 177 primary invasive breast carcinomas
revealed overexpression of LMO4 in 56% of specimens.
Immunohistochemistry confirmed overexpression in a high percentage (62%)
of tumors. These studies implied a role for LMO4 in maintaining
proliferation of mammary epithelium and suggested that deregulation of
this gene may contribute to breast tumorigenesis.

Using human and mouse expression plasmids in several protein interaction
assays, Sum et al. (2002) identified CTIP (604124) and BRCA1 (113705) as
LMO4-binding proteins. The LMO4-BRCA1 interaction required the
C-terminal BRCT domains of BRCA1. LDB1 also associated with a complex
containing LMO4, CTIP, and BRCA1 in transfected human embryonic kidney
cells. In functional assays, LMO4 repressed BRCA1-mediated
transcriptional activation in both yeast and mammalian cells.

Wittlin et al. (2003) found that the 2 LMO4 promoters exhibited strong
activity in breast cancer cell lines that correlated with RNA levels.
Promoter 2 appeared to be selectively activated in certain breast cancer
cell lines but not in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells,
implying aberrant activation of the LMO4 gene in the cancer cell lines.

By mammalian 2-hybrid analysis, Manetopoulos et al. (2003) showed that
the helix-loop-helix protein HEN1 (162360) interacted with both LMO2 and
LMO4. LMO4, but not LMO2, could augment HEN1-mediated repression of E47
(147141) transcriptional activity. LMO4 could also prevent HEN1-mediated
neurite extension in rat hippocampal precursor cells. Manetopoulos et
al. (2003) concluded that LMO4 can modulate the transcriptional activity
of HEN1.

Sum et al. (2005) found that downregulation of LMO4 expression by RNA
interference reduced proliferation of human breast cancer cells and
increased differentiation of mouse mammary epithelial cells.
Furthermore, transfection of small interfering RNA into breast cancer
cells reduced the capacity of the cells to migrate and invade an
extracellular matrix. Conversely, overexpression of LMO4 in noninvasive,
immortalized human breast epithelial cells promoted cell motility and
invasion. Sum et al. (2005) also found that high nuclear levels of LMO4
correlated with poor patient outcome in a cohort of 159 primary breast
cancers. They concluded that deregulation of LMO4 in breast epithelium
contributes directly to breast neoplasia by altering the rate of
cellular proliferation and promoting cell invasion.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic structure analysis, Tse et al. (1999) determined that the
mouse Lmo4 gene contains 6 exons, the last 4 of which encode the
165-amino acid protein.

Wittlin et al. (2003) determined that the LMO4 gene contains 2 5-prime
noncoding exons, exon 1a and 1b, and exon 2 encodes the first LIM
domain. Promoter 1, upstream of exon 1a, and promoter 2, upstream of
exon 1b, lack canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes, but both contain GC-rich
regions. Promoter 1 also has recognition sites for SP1 (189906) and
Kruppel-like factors (see KLF1; 600599), and promoter 2 has SP1-like
recognition elements, GC boxes, and AP2 (107580) sites.

MAPPING

Tse et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Lmo4 gene to chromosome 3 by
interspecific backcross analysis. Using FISH, they mapped the human LMO4
gene to 1p22.3, a region that is deleted in a number of human cancers.

;;GLUTAMYLCYCLOTRANSFERASE, GAMMA; GCTG;;
CHROMOSOME 7 OPEN READING FRAME 24; C7ORF24;;
CYTOCHROME c-RELEASING FACTOR, 21-KD; CRF21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GGCT (EC 2.3.2.4) catalyzes the formation of 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamic
acid) from gamma-glutamyl dipeptides and may play a significant role in
glutathione homeostasis (Oakley et al., 2008).

CLONING

By mass spectrometric analysis of peptides obtained from an
apoptosis-inducing protein, followed by database analysis and RT-PCR of
total RNA from a human leukemia cell line, Masuda et al. (2006) cloned
GGCT, which they called CRF21. SDS-PAGE detected purified CRF21 at an
apparent molecular mass of 21 kD.

Using tryptic peptides obtained from GGCT partially purified from
expired human red blood cells for database analysis, Oakley et al.
(2008) obtained a full-length GGCT cDNA. The deduced 188-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 21 kD. EST database analysis
revealed moderate GGCT expression in a wide range of human tissues, with
highest levels in bladder and salivary gland. Database analysis
identified GGCT orthologs in a range of species from C. elegans to
mammals, but not in plants.

GENE FUNCTION

Geranylgeraniol (GGO) induces apoptosis in human tumor cell lines
through a mitochondria-dependent pathway that includes cytochrome c
release. Masuda et al. (2006) found that GGO was unable to induce
cytochrome c release from isolated human mitochondria directly, and they
identified CRF21 as a cytosolic cytochrome c-releasing factor involved
in GGO-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of CRF21 in HeLa cells induced
cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Masuda et al. (2006) noted that
GGO-induced apoptosis was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutation of
JNK (MAPK8; 601158) that impeded JNK signaling, suggesting involvement
of JNK and CRF21 in GGO-induced apoptosis.

Oakley et al. (2008) confirmed that recombinant human GGCT used
gamma-glutamyl-L-alanine as its substrate. The enzymatic kinetics were
similar to those of GGCT purified from human erythrocytes.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Oakley et al. (2008) determined the crystal structure of recombinant
human GGCT to 2.4-angstrom resolution. GGCT adopted a mixed alpha/beta
topology with 6 beta stands, 5 alpha helices, and 4 short 3(10) helices,
and it assumed a unique structural fold that the authors termed a GGCT
fold. GGCT formed dimers, and each monomer featured an invagination that
Oakley et al. (2008) proposed was the active site. The site was lined
with hydrophilic and amphipathic residues, including a conserved glu98
that appeared to function as a general acid/base in the reaction.
Mutation of glu98 to ala or gln did not alter the structural fold, but
it completely inactivated the enzyme. Mutation analysis showed that
gly23 and tyr105 also contributed to substrate binding interactions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Oakley et al. (2008) determined that the GGCT gene contains 5 exons and
spans 8 kb.

MAPPING

Bissbort et al. (1984) assigned the GGCT gene to chromosome 7pter-p14 by
somatic cell hybrid studies.

By genomic sequence analysis, Oakley et al. (2008) mapped the GGCT gene
to chromosome 7p15-p14. They identified putative GGCT pseudogenes on
chromosomes 5 and 20. Oakley et al. (2008) noted that the mouse Ggct
gene maps to a region of chromosome 6 that shares homology of synteny
with human chromosome 7p15-p14.

612314	TITLE *612314 GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE, OMEGA-2; GSTO2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The omega class glutathione transferases (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) have poor
activity with common GST substrates, but exhibit novel
glutathione-dependent thioltransferase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and
monomethylarsonate reductase activities, and they modulate Ca(2+)
release by ryanodine receptors (e.g., RYR1, 180901) (Whitbread et al.,
2003).

For background information on GSTs, see 605482.

CLONING

By sequencing a chromosome 10 BAC contig containing the GSTO1 gene
(605482), Whitbread et al. (2003) identified GSTO2. The deduced
243-amino acid protein shares 64% identity with GSTO1. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2-kb GSTO2 transcript highly expressed in testis,
and a 1.26-kb GSTO2 transcript highly expressed in liver, kidney, and
skeletal muscle, with lower expression in heart and reproductive
tissues, predominantly testis, cervix, ovary, and prostate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Whitbread et al. (2003) determined that the GSTO2 gene contains 6 exons
and spans 24.5 kb.

MAPPING

By sequencing an unordered chromosome 10 contig containing GSTO1,
Whitbread et al. (2003) mapped the GSTO2 gene to chromosome 10q24-q25,
about 7.5-kb downstream of the GSTO1 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By PCR of an existing cDNA clone and by PCR of a testis cDNA library,
Whitbread et al. (2003) identified a GSTO2 polymorphism: a 424A-C
transition resulting in an asn142-to-asp (N142D) substitution.

;;CHITINASE, MACROPHAGE; CHIT;;
CHITOTRIOSIDASE;;
METHYLUMBELLIFERYL-TETRA-N-ACETYLCHITOTETRAOSIDE HYDROLASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CHIT1 gene encodes plasma methylumbelliferyl
tetra-N-acetylchitotetraoside hydrolase (chitotriosidase), a human
chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14). Chitinases play a role in degrading the chitin
walls of some microorganisms (Boot et al., 1995).

CLONING

Renkema et al. (1995) purified and characterized the chitotriosidase
protein from the spleen of a patient with Gaucher disease (230800) who
had increased serum CHIT1 enzyme activity. Two major isoforms with
isoelectric points of 7.2 and 8.0 and molecular masses of 50 and 39 kD,
respectively, were found to have identical N-terminal amino acid
sequences. An antiserum raised against the purified 39-kD
chitotriosidase precipitated all isozymes. The findings suggested that a
single gene encodes the different isoforms of chitotriosidase. The
authors postulated that the enzyme may be involved in defense against
and in degradation of chitin-containing pathogens such as fungi,
nematodes, and insects.

Boot et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the chitotriosidase
gene from a macrophage cDNA library. The deduced 445-amino acid protein
has a molecular mass of 49 kD, similar to the larger isoform detected by
Renkema et al. (1995). Secretion of active chitotriosidase was obtained
after transient transfection of COS-1 cells with the cloned cDNA.
Chitotriosidase contains several regions with high homology to those
present in chitinases from different species belonging to family 18 of
glycosylhydrolases. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of
chitotriosidase mRNA occurred only at a late stage of differentiation of
monocytes to activated macrophages in cell culture. The authors
speculated that the enzyme may play a role in the degradation of
chitin-containing pathogens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Boot et al. (1998) determined that the CHIT1 gene contains 12 exons and
spans about 20 kb.

MAPPING

Eiberg and Den Tandt (1997) mapped the CHIT locus to chromosome
1q31-qter between flanking markers D1S191 and D1S245. By fluorescence in
situ hybridization, Boot et al. (1998) assigned the CHIT gene to
1q31-q32.

GENE FUNCTION

Hollak et al. (1994) observed a very marked increase (more than
600-fold) of chitotriosidase activity in the plasma of 30 of 32
symptomatic patients with type I Gaucher disease (230800), which is due
to mutation in the gene encoding beta-glucosidase (GBA; 606463). The
increase in plasma chitotriosidase that they observed in Gaucher disease
patients was far more pronounced than the increase in alkaline
phosphatase (ALPL; 171760), which had been used as an important
diagnostic hallmark of the disease. Chitotriosidase activity declined
dramatically during enzyme supplementation therapy. In contrast, 3
GBA-deficient individuals without clinical symptoms had only slight
increases in chitotriosidase. The authors considered it unlikely that
chitotriosidase itself contributes to the clinical presentation of
Gaucher disease. Hollak et al. (1994) noted that the similarity between
lysozyme (LYZ; 153450) and chitotriosidase with respect to catalytic
activity toward particular substrates suggested that the latter may also
function in host defense mechanisms, e.g., through cleavage of bacterial
cell wall polysaccharide. Hollak et al. (1994) suggested that the
macrophages loaded with glucosylceramide in Gaucher disease are the main
source of the plasma enzyme activity. No elevation, or only moderate
elevation, of plasma chitotriosidase was found in a variety of
granulomatous immunologic disorders.

Boot et al. (1995) noted that homologous chitinases in plants are known
to defend against fungal pathogens. The bactericidal function of
lysozyme is also well established; nevertheless, in rabbits an inherited
deficiency in lysozyme occurs that seems to have little consequence for
susceptibility to infections. The diverse array of defense mechanisms of
the immune system in mammals probably renders sufficient tolerance to
defects in single enzymes such as lysozyme and chitotriosidase.

By comparing the antifungal properties of human macrophage
chitotriosidase and its isolated domains, Vandevenne et al. (2011)
showed that the catalytic domain was sufficient for antifungal activity
and tended to be more efficient than the intact enzyme. In contrast, the
chitin-binding domain did not possess any antifungal properties.
Mutations in chitotriosidase that rendered the macrophage enzyme
inactive could be compensated by lysozyme, which had even greater
antifungal activity than chitotriosidase, as well as antibacterial
activity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In individuals with chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Boot et al.
(1998) identified a homozygous 24-bp duplication in the CHIT1 gene
(600031.0001). The observed carrier frequency of about 35% indicated
that the duplication is the predominant cause of chitotriosidase
deficiency. The presence of the duplication in individuals from various
ethnic backgrounds suggested that this mutation is relatively old.

Grace et al. (2007) noted that the identification of CHIT1 gene
mutations that alter plasma activity is important for the use of this
biomarker to monitor disease activity and therapeutic response in
Gaucher disease. They genotyped the CHIT1 gene in 320 unrelated patients
with Gaucher disease, including 272 of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Among
all patients, 4% and 37.2% were homozygous and heterozygous,
respectively, for the 24-bp duplication. In addition, Grace et al.
(2007) identified 3 novel mutations in the CHIT1 gene
(600031.0002-600031.0004) in individuals with Gaucher disease and
chitotriosidase deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, 24-BP DUP

Boot et al. (1998) found that chitotriosidase deficiency (614122) can be
caused by a 24-bp duplication in exon 10 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in
activation of a cryptic 3-prime splice site, generating an mRNA with an
in-frame deletion of 87 nucleotides. All chitotriosidase-deficient
individuals tested were homozygous for the duplication. Among 171 Dutch
persons, 6.4% were homozygous and 35.1% were heterozygous for the
mutation. Among 68 Ashkenazi Jewish subjects, 5.9% were homozygous and
33.8% were heterozygous. The mutant chitotriosidase is predicted to lack
amino acids 344-372. On the basis of homology with several chitinases
for which the 3-dimensional structure has been resolved by
crystallographic analysis, the authors predicted that the internal
deletion in the mutant chitotriosidase prevents the formation of a
proper barrel conformation, with resulting loss of chitinolytic
activity.

Among a total of 320 unrelated patients with Gaucher disease (232800),
including 272 of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, Grace et al. (2007) found
that 4% and 37.2% were homozygous or heterozygous for the CHIT1 24-bp
dup, respectively. The allele frequency was 0.227.

.0002
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLY354ARG, LEU385LEU, AND 4-BP DEL

In a Caribbean Hispanic/African type 1 Gaucher disease (230800) patient
with chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified
a complex allele of the CHIT1 gene with 3 different variations in cis: a
1060G-A transition in exon 10 resulting in a gly354-to-arg (G354R)
substitution, a 1155G-A transition in exon 10 resulting in a synonymous
leu385-to-leu (L385L) substitution, and a 4-bp deletion in intron 10
(1156delGTAA). The complex allele was designated 'E/I-10'
(exon/intron-10) allele. The patient was compound heterozygous for the
E/I-10 complex allele and the common 24-bp duplication (600031.0001). In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the complex mutant had
no residual enzyme activity. Further screening identified the complex
allele in individuals of Caribbean Hispanic, Dominican, Caribbean Black,
Puerto Rican, and American Black descent. It was not identified in those
of Caucasian or Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

.0003
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLU74LYS

In a type I Gaucher disease (230800) patient with chitotriosidase
deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified a 220G-A transition
in exon 3 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in a glu74-to-lys (E74K)
substitution. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
E74K mutant had 51% activity compared to control values. The E74K allele
was found in 3 (1.4%) of 208 Ashkenazi Jewish alleles, but not in
non-Ashkenazi Jewish alleles, indicating that it is very rare. This
mutation was not found in normal controls.

.0004
CHITOTRIOSIDASE DEFICIENCY
CHIT1, GLY102SER

In 3 Ashkenazi Jewish type I Gaucher disease (230800) patients with
chitotriosidase deficiency (614122), Grace et al. (2007) identified a
304G-A transition in exon 4 of the CHIT1 gene, resulting in a
gly102-to-ser (G102S) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies showed that the G102S mutant had 23% activity compared to
control values. The G102S allele had a frequency of 0.2 to 0.3 in
various control populations.

606827	TITLE *606827 PLEXIN DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; PLXDC2
;;TUMOR ENDOTHELIAL MARKER 7-RELATED PROTEIN; TEM7R
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), St Croix et al. (2000)
identified partial cDNAs corresponding to several tumor endothelial
markers (TEMs) that displayed elevated expression during tumor
angiogenesis. Among the genes they identified was PLXDC1 (606826), which
they called TEM7. While searching databases for the mouse Plxdc1
ortholog, Carson-Walter et al. (2001) identified Plxdc2, which they
called Tem7r. They subsequently identified the human PLXDC2 sequence,
which encodes a predicted 529-amino acid transmembrane protein that
shares 91% amino acid identity with mouse Plxdc2.

In situ hybridization analysis of human colorectal cancer by
Carson-Walter et al. (2001) demonstrated that TEM7R was expressed
clearly in the endothelial cells of the tumor stroma but not in the
endothelial cells of normal colonic tissue. Using in situ hybridization
to assay expression in various adult mouse tissues, Carson-Walter et al.
(2001) detected Tem7r expression at high levels not only in tumor
endothelium but also in vessels of some normal tissues, with highest
expression in muscle and lung.

;;KERATIN 1B; K1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Keratins, such as KRT77, are filament proteins that make up one of the
major structural fibers of epithelial cells (Rogers et al., 2005).

CLONING

Using database analysis to identify keratin genes within the type II
keratin gene domain on chromosome 12, Rogers et al. (2005) identified
KRT77, which they called K1B. The deduced 578-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 61.8 kD. Like other type II keratins, K1B
has N- and C-terminal domains and a central rod domain consisting of 4
alpha-helical regions separated by 3 nonhelical linker sequences. In
addition, it has numerous GGG and GGX repeats in its head and tail
domains. Northern blot analysis detected weak expression of a 3.0-kb K1B
transcript in skin, but not in scalp or in any other tissues or organs
examined.

Using in situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence, Langbein et
al. (2005) detected strong K1B expression in the ducts of eccrine sweat
glands, but not in the deeper secretory portion of the glands.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rogers et al. (2005) mapped the KRT77 gene
to chromosome 12q13.13.

DESCRIPTION For general information about receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases
(PTPases), see PTPRA (176884).

CLONING

To identify protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) involved in the
oncogenic process leading to the development of pancreatic carcinoma,
Wang et al. (1996) performed PCR on pooled poly(A)+ RNA from 9 human
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines using PTPase consensus oligonucleotide
primers. One of the novel PCR products recovered was termed PCP2 and was
used to screen a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cDNA library. The full
sequence of PCP2 predicts a 1,430 amino acid protein consisting of a
putative extracellular domain of 740 amino acids, a single transmembrane
domain, and an intracellular domain of 666 amino acids. The
intracellular region contains 2 tandemly repeated PTP catalytic domains
with a high degree of identity to the catalytic domains of mouse
PTP-kappa and PTP-mu. In addition to a signal peptide and 13 potential
N-linked glycosylation sites, the extracellular domain contains a MAM
(meprin/A5/PTP-mu) domain followed by 1 Ig-like repeat and 4 putative
fibronectin type III repeats. The MAM domain, found in Xenopus A5
glycoprotein, meprin A, and meprin B, as well as in PTP-kappa and
PTP-mu, may be involved in attachment to the cytoskeleton. PCP2,
PTP-kappa, and PTP-mu appear to form a subfamily of MAM-containing
receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs). PCP2 also contains the tripeptide HAV,
implicated in cell-cell contact in the cadherins. By Northern blot
analysis, Wang et al. (1996) demonstrated that the 5.5-kb PCP2
transcript is widely distributed at varying levels, with very high
expression in brain, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, but no expression in
placenta or spleen. Subcellular localization using laser scanning
immunofluorescence microscopy showed localization of PCP2 at
intercellular adhesions and colocalization with beta-catenin and
E-cadherin. Wang et al. (1996) hypothesized that PCP2 and other members
of this subfamily of RPTPases may function as cell contact receptors
that mediate and control cell-cell signals.

Wang et al. (1997) used degenerate PCR to clone PTPJ, a member of the
type II receptor PTPase family. The PTPJ cDNA encodes a 1,436-amino acid
polypeptide that includes a single transmembrane domain and a
cytoplasmic domain containing 2 tandemly repeated PTP catalytic domains.
The presence of 2 PTP domains indicates that this gene is a member of
the type II receptor PTPases. Northern blot analysis detected expression
in skeletal muscle, heart, prostate, pancreas, and placenta.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (1996) showed that PCP2 had tyrosine phosphatase activity
using an in vitro pNPP assay.

Wang et al. (1997) found that in lymphocytes or lymphoma cells,
expression of PTPJ was downregulated following stimulation by either
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or calcium ionophore, suggesting that
PMA or calcium signaling pathways may be involved in regulating the
expression of PTPJ.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the PTPRU gene to chromosome 1p35.3 based on an
alignment of the PTPRU sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB208855) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608221	TITLE *608221 MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED SERINE/THREONINE KINASE-LIKE; MASTL
;;FLJ14813;;
GREATWALL; GWL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Gandhi et al. (2003) identified MASTL, which they called FLJ14813,
within the region of chromosome 10p where Drachman et al. (2000) had
mapped autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia, also known as
thrombocytopenia-2 (THC2; 188000), by linkage analysis. The protein
product of the MASTL gene is a putative kinase that contains 2 highly
conserved kinase domains. Gandhi et al. (2003) noted that a similar
gene, 'greatwall,' had been described in Drosophila. EMS-induced
mutations in the greatwall gene cause a metaphase-arrest phenotype and
problems in chromosome condensation.

GENE FUNCTION

A particular form of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915)
containing a B55-delta subunit (PPP2R2D; 613992) is the major protein
phosphatase that acts on model CDK substrates in Xenopus egg extracts
and has antimitotic activity. The activity of PP2A-B55-delta is high in
interphase and low in mitosis, exactly the opposite of CDK1 (116940).
Mochida et al. (2010) reported that inhibition of PP2A-B55-delta results
from a small protein known as alpha-endosulfine (ENSA; 603061), that is
phosphorylated in mitosis by the protein kinase Greatwall (Gwl, also
known as MASTL). This converts Ensa into a potent and specific inhibitor
of PP2A-B55-delta. Mochida et al. (2010) concluded that this pathway
represents a previously unknown element in the control of mitosis.
Mochida et al. (2010) also showed that Arpp19 (605487) is a substrate of
Gwl.

Initiation and maintenance of mitosis require the inhibition of PP2A,
which dephosphorylates mitotic substrates. The protein kinase Greatwall
is required to maintain mitosis through PP2A inhibition. Gharbi-Ayachi
et al. (2010) described how Gwl activation results in PP2A inhibition.
They identified Arpp19 and Ensa as 2 substrates of Gwl that, when
phosphorylated by this kinase, associate with and inhibit PP2A, thus
promoting mitotic entry. Conversely, in the absence of Gwl activity,
Arpp19 and Ensa are dephosphorylated and lose their capacity to bind and
inhibit PP2A. Gharbi-Ayachi et al. (2010) stated that although both
proteins can inhibit PP2A, endogenous Arpp19, but not Ensa, is
responsible for PP2A inhibition and mitotic entry in Xenopus egg
extracts.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By extensive sequencing of multiple genes located in the critical
segment on 10p, Gandhi et al. (2003) demonstrated a missense mutation in
the MASTL gene (608221.0001) in a family with thrombocytopenia-2 (THC2;
188000) mapping to this region.

However, Pippucci et al. (2011) found no mutations in the MASTL gene in
4 families with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia mapping to
chromosome 10p. Instead, Pippucci et al. (2011) identified 6 different
heterozygous mutations in the 5-prime promoter region of the ANKRD26
gene (see, e.g., 610855.0001-610855.0003), which maps to the THC2 locus
on chromosome 10p12-p11.2, in 9 of 20 unrelated families with autosomal
dominant nonsyndromic thrombocytopenia-2.

By sequencing multiple genes in the critical region of autosomal
dominant thrombocytopenia (188000), also known as thrombocytopenia-2
(Drachman et al., 2000), Gandhi et al. (2003) found a missense mutation
in the MASTL gene: a 565G-C transversion predicted to result in a
glu167-to-asp (E167D) amino acid substitution.

612159	TITLE *612159 RABPHILIN 3A; RPH3A
;;KIAA0985
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Exocytosis of neurotransmitters and hormones is fundamental to synaptic
neurotransmission and cell-cell communication. RAB3A (179390) is a small
G protein that is thought to act at late stages of exocytosis, and RPH3A
is a RAB3A effector (Lin et al., 2007).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned RPH3A, which they designated
KIAA0985. The deduced 694-amino acid protein shares 86.9% identity over
703 amino acids with rat Rph3a. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression
in fetal brain, followed by adult spinal cord and whole brain. Much
lower expression was detected in adult lung, testis, and spleen.
Expression was high in all specific adult brain regions tested, with
highest abundance in subthalamic nuclei and thalamus.

Inagaki et al. (1994) cloned mouse Rph3a, which encodes a deduced
681-amino acid protein with an N-terminal Rab3a-binding region and 2
C-terminal internal repeats homologous to the regulatory domain (C2
domain) of protein kinase C (see PRKCZ; 176982). Northern blot analysis
detected Rph3a highly expressed in brain and in several mammalian
endocrine and hormone-secreting cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Lin et al. (2007) found that direct interaction with rabphilin was
required for hydrolysis of GTP by Rab3a in stimulated rat
pheochromocytoma cells and for dissociation of Rab3a from vesicles and
exocytosis.

Smith et al. (2007) stated that the amount of Rph3a protein was reduced
in different brain regions in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington
disease (HD; 143100) and that Rph3a interacted with the SNARE synaptic
complex via Snap25 (600322). Western blot and immunohistochemical
analysis showed that levels of both SNAP25 and RPH3A were reduced in
human HD cortex. SNAP25 protein levels were lower even in HD brains with
limited neuropathology; the level of RPH3A deceased in HD brains with
higher neuropathologic grade and higher CAG repeats. The loss of SNAP25
and RPH3A was not due to general loss of synapses in HD cortex, since
the levels of other synapse-related proteins, including RAB3A, were
unaltered in the same patient samples.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the RPH3A gene
to chromosome 12.

;;CHONDROITIN 6-SULFOTRANSFERASE; C6ST;;
C6ST1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, which consist of a core protein with
at least 1 covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain, are
distributed on the surfaces of most cells and the extracellular matrix
in virtually every tissue. See 118661. Chondroitin sulfate has a linear
polymer structure that possesses repetitive, sulfated disaccharide units
containing glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc).
The major chondroitin sulfate found in mammalian tissues has sulfate
groups at position 4 or 6 of GalNAc residues. Chondroitin
6-sulfotransferase (C6ST) catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from PAPS
(3-prime-phosphoadenosine 5-prime-phosphosulfate) to position 6 of the
GalNAc residues. By screening a placenta library with a chicken C6ST
cDNA, Tsutsumi et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding human C6ST. The
predicted 479-amino acid protein shares 74% and 36% identity with chick
C6ST and human keratan sulfate gal-6-sulfotransferase (CHST1; 603797),
respectively. Recombinant human enzyme displayed C6ST activity with a
marked specificity for a GlcA-GalNAc sequence. In addition, C6ST
catalyzed the sulfation of keratan sulfate. They noted that a deficiency
in C6ST has been associated with a heritable form of spondyloepiphyseal
dysplasia (271630).

Independently, Fukuta et al. (1998) cloned human C6ST cDNAs. Using
Northern blot analysis, they found that the 7.8-kb C6ST mRNA was
ubiquitous. Smaller transcripts were also observed in skeletal muscle
and heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsutsumi et al. (1998) reported that the C6ST gene contains 3 exons and
spans more than 20 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Iida et al. (2002) characterized single-nucleotide polymorphisms and
insertion-deletion polymorphisms in both the CHST1 gene (603797) and the
CHST3 gene.

In affected members of a large inbred Omani kindred with
spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital joint dislocations (143095),
Thiele et al. (2004) identified a homozygous arg304-to-gln mutation in
the CHST3 gene (R304Q; 603799.0001).

In 6 unrelated patients born with joint dislocations, some of whom
carried a diagnosis of recessive Larsen syndrome and others,
humerospinal dysostosis, Hermanns et al. (2008) identified homozygosity
or compound heterozygosity for 9 different mutations in the CHST3 gene
(see, e.g., 603799.0002-603799.0006). Noting the relatively narrow
phenotypic spectrum of these conditions, Hermanns et al. (2008)
suggested that the disorders previously designated as Omani-type
spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and humerospinal dysostosis, as well as
some patients given a diagnosis of recessive Larsen syndrome, might
represent different age-related descriptions of the same condition.

In 2 Turkish sibs with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital joint
dislocations, born of consanguineous parents, van Roij et al. (2008)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the CHST3 gene
(603799.0007).

In 2 sibs and their affected uncle from a consanguineous Turkish
pedigree with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and subluxation of the radial
head, Tuysuz et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a missense
mutation in the CHST3 gene (T141M; 603799.0009).

Unger et al. (2010) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations in CHST3 in 18 patients with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and
congenital joint dislocations from 17 families. The patients had
presented with various diagnoses, including 15 who had been diagnosed
with Larsen syndrome (see, e.g., 603799.0011 and 603799.0012), 2 with
chondrodysplasia with multiple dislocations (see, e.g., 603799.0002), 1
with humerospinal dysostosis (see 603799.0010), 1 with Desbuquois
syndrome (see 251450), and 1 with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia.

In affected members of the large inbred kindred with spondyloepiphyseal
dysplasia with congenital joint dislocations (143095), first described
by Rajab et al. (2004) and designated 'Omani type,' Thiele et al. (2004)
identified a homozygous 911G-A transition in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene,
resulting in an arg304-to-gln (R304Q) substitution. The mutation occurs

In a 10.5-year-old Turkish-German girl with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia
and congenital joint dislocations (143095), born of consanguineous
parents, Hermanns et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a 776T-C
transition in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene, resulting in a leu259-to-pro
(L259P) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The parents were
heterozygous for the mutation, and the patient had an unaffected
brother. Functional analysis in cultured skin fibroblasts revealed that
the L259P mutation severely impaired or abolished CHST3 function. Unger
et al. (2010) restudied this patient and noted that although she had
initially been diagnosed as having Larsen syndrome (see 245600), there
was now clear evidence of SED with severe spinal degeneration.

In a Lebanese boy with SED and congenital joint dislocations, who was
originally reported by Megarbane and Ghanem (2004) and given the
diagnosis of 'chondrodysplasia with multiple dislocations,' Unger et al.
(2010) identified homozygosity for the L259P mutation in the CHST3 gene.

In a 17-year-old Swiss patient with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with

small village, Hermanns et al. (2008) identified homozygosity for a
664C-T transition in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene, resulting in an
arg222-to-trp (R222W) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
parents were heterozygous for the mutation, and the patient had an
unaffected brother. Functional analysis in cultured skin fibroblasts
revealed that the R222W mutation severely impaired or abolished CHST3
function. Unger et al. (2010) restudied this patient and noted that
although initially the diagnosis had been Larsen syndrome (see 245600),
there was now clear evidence of SED with severe spinal degeneration.

homozygosity for a 920T-C transition in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene,
resulting in a leu307-to-pro (L307P) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Although the
patient previously carried a diagnosis of recessive Larsen syndrome
(245600), the authors noted that his appearance was 'identical' to that
of the patient originally reported with humerospinal dysostosis by Hall
(1997) (see 603799.0010).

Unger et al. (2010) studied cultured fibroblasts from the Sardinian boy
who was homozygous for L307P and observed almost no C6ST activity
compared to controls.

.0005
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, 1-BP DEL, 1086G

In a 31-year-old Spanish man with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with
congenital joint dislocations (143095), originally reported as having
humerospinal dysostosis (HSD) at 2 years of age by Cortina et al.
(1979), Hermanns et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for a
1-bp deletion (1086delG) in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination of the protein, and a 603C-A
transversion in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene, resulting in a tyr201-to-ter
(Y201X; 603799.0006) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The
parents were each heterozygous for one of the mutations, respectively,
and he had an unaffected sister. In another Spanish patient who had
originally been diagnosed with HSD, Hermanns et al. (2008) identified
compound heterozygosity for 1086delG and a 1114G-A transition in exon 3
of the CHST3 gene, resulting in a glu372-to-lys (E372K) substitution at
a highly conserved residue. The E372K mutation was not found in more
than 250 control chromosomes.

In 2 Turkish sibs with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital joint
dislocations (143095), born of second-cousin parents, van Roij et al.
(2008) identified homozygosity for an 857T-C transition in the CHST3
gene, predicted to result in a leu286-to-pro (L286P) substitution at a
highly conserved residue adjacent to the binding site for PAPS.
Functional studies in patient fibroblasts showed dramatically reduced
C6ST1 activity compared to wildtype.

SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, THR141MET

In 2 sibs and their affected paternal uncle from a consanguineous
Turkish pedigree with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital joint
dislocations (143095), Tuysuz et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for
a 422C-T transition in exon 3 of the CHST3 gene, resulting in a
thr141-to-met (T141M) substitution at a conserved residue. Western blot
analysis showed comparable expression levels of the mutant and wildtype
proteins, but sulfotransferase activity of the mutant was reduced to
less than 30% of wildtype.

SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, PHE159ILE

In a 15-year-old patient with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and
congenital joint dislocations (143095), originally reported by Hall
(1997) with a diagnosis of humerospinal dysostosis, Unger et al. (2010)
identified homozygosity for a 475T-A transversion in the CHST3 gene,
resulting in a phe159-to-ile (F159I) substitution. The mutation was not
found in more than 250 control chromosomes. Follow-up evaluation of the
patient by Unger et al. (2010) showed a dysplastic mitral valve with
stenosis and moderate insufficiency, as well as a mildly thickened
aortic valve.

SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA WITH CONGENITAL JOINT DISLOCATIONS
CHST3, LEU161PHE

In a patient with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital joint
dislocations (143095), who was referred for evaluation of presumed
Larsen syndrome (see 245600), Unger et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for a 481C-T transition in the CHST3 gene, resulting in a
leu161-to-phe (L161F) substitution. The mutation was not found in more
than 250 control chromosomes.

CHST3, GLN330TER

In a patient with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and congenital joint
dislocations (143095), who had initially been diagnosed with Larsen
syndrome (see 150250) but who was negative for mutation in the FLNB gene
(603381), Unger et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 988C-T
transition in the CHST3 gene, resulting in a gln330-to-ter (Q330X)
substitution.

138300	TITLE +138300 GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE; GSR
GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE, HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA DUE TO DEFICIENCY OF, IN RED
CELLS, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION Long (1967) found in a black American a variant red cell GSR (EC
1.6.4.2) characterized by greater electrophoretic mobility and enzyme
activity per unit of hemoglobin than the normal. Inheritance was
autosomal codominant. Three homozygotes were identified. The relation to
gout, suggested by Long (1967), is problematical. Long (1972) observed 2
variant forms of red cell GSR which appear to bind far more avidly than
the common form of the enzyme. In cases of mosaic trisomy for chromosome
8, de la Chapelle et al. (1976) found elevated glutathione reductase
activity, with other enzymes normal. George and Francke (1976) assigned
the gene to the region 8p21-p23 by the gene dosage method. In an infant
with terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 8, de la Chapelle
et al. (1976) found low GSR activity. They concluded that the GSR locus
is in the region 8pter-p21. Sinet et al. (1977) narrowed the assignment
to 8p21. The GSR locus has also been assigned by somatic cell
hybridization; it is one of the enzyme-markers for each chromosome
(table 1 in Shows and Sakaguchi, 1980), useful for synteny mapping.

Lohr and Waller (1962) observed a 'new' form of enzyme-deficiency
hemolytic anemia in which glutathione reductase was deficient and
glutathione (GSH) was low as a consequence. (This condition is
apparently distinct from that described by Oort et al. (1961) in which
GSH was also low, but glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione
reductase were normal.) Lohr (1963) observed 10 homozygotes and 5
heterozygotes in a family distribution consistent with autosomal
recessive inheritance. Blume et al. (1968) studied a kindred with many
persons who were demonstrably heterozygous by chemical test. Hampel et
al. (1969) found a markedly increased frequency of chromosomal
aberrations in a patient with pancytopenia and absent GSR-II band in the
electropherogram. The mother was hematologically normal but had absent
GSR-II band and a moderate increase in the frequency of chromosomal
aberrations. Addition of chloramphenicol to the cultures increased the
number of damaged chromosomes in both the mother and the son. Staal et
al. (1969) described a variety of glutathione reductase anemia in which
the variant enzyme had diminished affinity for flavin adenine
dinucleotide (FAD). The patient's anemia was corrected by vitamin B2.
Administration of flavin compounds to normal individuals or addition to
hemolysates of most normal persons causes an increase in activity of GSR
(Beutler, 1969). In a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus,
Fajnholc et al. (1971) found red cell GSR deficiency which was
correctable in vivo with riboflavin and in vitro with FAD. The same
deficiency was found in the mother and some of her relatives (who were
asymptomatic) but not in the father and his relatives. Enzyme kinetics
were normal. These workers concluded that the defect was not in the
apoenzyme. Loos et al. (1976) found virtually complete absence of GSR
activity in the erythrocytes of 3 children of a consanguineous marriage
and intermediate levels in the parents. Activity was not restored by FAD
in vitro or riboflavin in vivo. Clinically the deficiency was manifested
by favism in 1 child and by cataracts in 2. Reduced GSR was found in
leukocytes, as well as evidence of impaired bactericidal capacity, but
there was no history of repeated infections. Furthermore, Roos et al.
(1979) found that chemotaxis, phagocytosis of opsonized S. aureus, and
degranulation proceeded normally. Intracellular killing appeared normal
at low ratios of bacteria to phagocytes, but higher ratios resulted in
defective bacterial killing. GSR deficiency is a frequent occurrence in
northern Thailand. Flatz (1971) found a high frequency of GSR deficiency
in northern Thailand but concluded that it was probably secondary to
dietary riboflavin deficiency because activity of the enzyme was raised
markedly in most deficient persons by administration of riboflavin.
Studies of the families of 6 persons with poor response to riboflavin
gave no evidence supporting 'simple dominant inheritance,' and the
proband with low GSR values had no hematologic evidence of a hemolytic
tendency. Nevin et al. (1990) found increased GSR activity in a child
with an inverted tandem duplication of 8p23.1-p12.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a combination of behavioral analysis of 6 inbred mouse strains
with quantitative gene expression profiling of several brain regions,
Hovatta et al. (2005) identified 17 genes with expression patterns that
correlated with anxiety-like behavioral phenotypes. To determine if 2 of
the genes, glyoxalase-1 (138750) and glutathione reductase-1, have a
causal role in the genesis of anxiety, Hovatta et al. (2005) performed
genetic manipulation using lentivirus-mediated gene transfer. Local
overexpression of these genes in the mouse brain resulted in increased
anxiety-like behavior, while local inhibition of glyoxalase-1 expression
by RNA interference decreased the anxiety-like behavior. Hovatta et al.
(2005) concluded that both of these genes are involved in oxidative
stress metabolism, linking this pathway with anxiety-related behavior.

613567	TITLE *613567 ZINC FINGER, MYM-TYPE 6; ZMYM6
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 258; ZNF258;;
ZINC FINGER BED DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7; ZBED7;;
BUSTER2;;
KIAA1353
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZBED proteins, such as ZMYM6, or ZBED7, originated from domesticated hAT
DNA transposons and encode regulatory proteins with diverse, fundamental
functions in vertebrates (Hayward et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences encoding zinc finger-like
proteins, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a human thymus cDNA
library, Smedley et al. (1999) cloned ZNF258. The deduced 724-amino acid
protein contains 5 tandem myeloproliferative and mental retardation
(MYM) motifs, conserved motifs that closely resemble zinc-binding
sequences. However, 2 of the repeats are imperfect and each lacks 2
conserved cysteines. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression
of several ZNF258 transcripts in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ZMYM6, which they designated
KIAA1353. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in its
5-prime end. The deduced protein contains 640 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected ZMYM6 expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
adult brain regions examined.

By searching databases for ZBED genes, Hayward et al. (2013) identified
ZMYM6, which they called ZBED7.

MAPPING

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, Smedley et al. (1999) mapped
the ZMYM6 gene to chromosome 14q12. However, using radiation hybrid
analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ZMYM6 gene to chromosome 1.
Gross (2013) mapped the ZMYM6 gene to chromosome 1p34.3 based on an
alignment of the ZMYM6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC117463) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

EVOLUTION

Hayward et al. (2013) found that the ZBED genes originated from at least
2 independent hAT DNA transposon domestication events in ancestors of
primitive jawed vertebrates, since no orthologs of ZBED were found in
jawless fish or more primitive vertebrates. ZBED7 belongs to the Buster
family of domesticated hAT DNA transposons, which also includes ZBED5
(615251), ZBED8 (C5ORF54; 615253), and ZBED9 (SCAND3; 615254).

604909	TITLE *604909 CCR4-NOT TRANSCRIPTION COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 2; CNOT2
;;NEGATIVE REGULATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION 2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;
NOT2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The yeast CCR4-NOT protein complex is a global regulator of RNA
polymerase II transcription. It is comprised, in part, of CCR4 (see
608951), NOT1 to NOT5, and CAF1 (also referred to as POP2). By searching
sequence databases, Albert et al. (2000) identified human ESTs encoding
homologs of yeast NOT1, NOT2, NOT3, NOT4, and CAF1. They assembled a
human NOT2 cDNA containing a full-length coding sequence. The deduced
540-amino acid human NOT2 protein shares 26% overall sequence identity
with the 191-amino acid yeast NOT2 protein. Compared to yeast NOT2,
human NOT2 has an N-terminal extension. Human NOT2 contains an
N-terminal putative bipartite nuclear localization signal. Using the
yeast 2-hybrid assay, Albert et al. (2000) demonstrated that recombinant
human NOT2 can interact with yeast NOT1 and an N-terminally truncated
human NOT1 protein (604917); it did not significantly interact with
human NOT3 (604910) or yeast CCR4. Northern blot analysis detected a
3.2-kb NOT2 transcript in all human tissues examined, namely brain,
heart, lung, liver, kidney, small intestine, colon, spleen, thymus,
peripheral blood leukocytes, skeletal muscle, and placenta. Like the
expression of human NOT1, NOT3, and CALIF (603731), NOT2 expression was
high in brain, kidney, and placenta and very low in skeletal muscle and
colon. Albert et al. (2000) found that recombinant human NOT2 could not
complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype conferred by the yeast
not2-1 mutation.

GENE FUNCTION

Sessions et al. (2009) identified insect host factors required for
dengue virus (see 614371) propagation by carrying out a genomewide RNA
interference screen in D. melanogaster cells using a well established
22,632 double-stranded RNA library. This screen identified 116 candidate
dengue virus host factors (DVHFs). Although some were previously
associated with flaviviruses, most of the DVHFs were newly implicated in
dengue virus propagation. The dipteran DVHFs had 82 readily recognizable
human homologs and, using a targeted short interfering RNA screen, they
showed that 42 of these are human DVHFs. These include NPR2 (108961),
SEC61B (609214), TMEM214, TAZ (300394), EXDL2, and CNOT2. Sessions et
al. (2009) concluded that this overlap indicates notable conservation of
required factors between dipteran and human hosts.

;;MAPKKK6;;
APOPTOSIS SIGNAL-REGULATING KINASE 2; ASK2
DESCRIPTION Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades consist of a 3-kinase
module: MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAP2K, MAPKK, or MKK), and MKK kinase (MAP3K,
MAPKKK, or MEKK). These kinase cascades relay signals from the cell
surface to the nucleus, resulting in gene transcription. Growth factors
and mitogens activate the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway,
while stress stimuli and proinflammatory cytokines activate 2 closely
related but distinct parallel pathways, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK), or stress-activated kinase (SAPK), pathway and the p38 kinase
pathway. Multiple upstream kinases, the MAP3Ks, have been identified.
MAP3K5 (602448) activates the JNK and p38 pathways and induces apoptosis
when overexpressed in stably transfected cells. Using a portion of
MAP3K5 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid system, Wang et al. (1998) isolated a
partial cDNA encoding a novel protein kinase, MAP3K6, which they called
MAPKKK6. They isolated a full-length human skeletal muscle MAP3K6 cDNA
encoding a predicted 1,280-amino acid serine/threonine kinase containing
all 11 kinase subdomains. MAP3K6 and MAP3K5 share 45% amino acid
sequence identity; their catalytic domains share 82% identity. The
authors confirmed the interaction of MAP3K6 with MAP3K5 in vivo using
coimmunoprecipitation. Recombinant MAP3K6 weakly activated the JNK but
not the ERK or p38 kinase pathways. Northern blot analysis detected an
approximately 5.0-kb MAP3K6 transcript in several tissues, with the
highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle.

;;p40.5;;
PROTEASE 26S, SUBUNIT 11; S11
DESCRIPTION Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by a 26S ATP-dependent protease. The
protease is composed of a 20S catalytic proteasome and PA700, a 700-kD
regulatory complex (see PSMC1; 602706).

Hori et al. (1998) determined the partial protein sequences of bovine
p28 (PSMD10; 603480) and p40.5, 2 components of PA700. By searching a
sequence database, they identified cDNAs encoding the human p28 and
p40.5 homologs. The predicted human p40.5 protein contains 376 amino
acids and has a molecular mass of 43 kD. Using computerized homology
searches, Hori et al. (1998) identified Nas7, an S. cerevisiae gene
encoding a protein with 31% identity to p40.5. They disrupted the Nas7
gene and found that Nas7-deficient yeast cells were sensitive to heat
stress. Northern blot analysis revealed that p40.5 was expressed as a
1.3-kb mRNA in all human tissues tested.

By sequencing peptides obtained from purified 26S proteasome subunits,
followed by database analysis and PCR of human myeloblast cell line RNA,
Hoffman et al. (1999) cloned the PSMD13 gene, which they called subunit
11 (S11). The deduced 376-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 42.9 kD, and it shares 97% identity with mouse S11. Western blot
analysis detected S11 at about 43 kD.

By Far Western blot analysis, Hoffman et al. (1999) determined that S11
bound the 26S proteasome and the 19S regulatory complex, but not the 20S
proteasome.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PSMD13
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP STS-T99644).

;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.

608879	TITLE *608879 VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 13, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF, C; VPS13C
;;KIAA1421
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned VPS13C, which they designated
KIAA1421. The deduced protein contains 1,463 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected VPS13C expression in all adult and fetal tissues and all
specific brain regions examined. Expression was intermediate in most
tissues, but it was lower in adult pancreas and lung and in fetal liver
and brain.

By searching databases for sequences similar to VPS13A (605978),
followed by RT-PCR of lymphoid cell line and brain RNA, Velayos-Baeza et
al. (2004) cloned VPS13C. They identified 2 main splice variants,
variant 1A and variant 2A, as well as 4 different 3-prime end splice
variants. Variant 1A encodes a deduced 3,710-amino acid protein, and
variant 2A encodes a deduced 3,753-amino acid protein. VPS13C shares
significant similarity with yeast Vps13 and other human VPS13 proteins,
mostly in the N and C termini. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of variant 1A in all tissues tested, whereas variant 2A was
expressed only in brain, although at a higher level than variant 1A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Velayos-Baeza et al. (2004) determined that the VPS13C gene contains 86
exons, including 1 alternative exon (exon 81b), and spans 208 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the VPS13C
gene to chromosome 15. By genomic sequence analysis, Velayos-Baeza et
al. (2004) mapped the VPS13C gene to chromosome 15q21.3. They mapped the
mouse Vps13c gene to chromosome 9C.

605237	TITLE *605237 XENOTROPIC AND POLYTROPIC RETROVIRUS RECEPTOR; XPR1
;;X RECEPTOR;;
SYG1, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; SYG1
DESCRIPTION There are 4 classes of murine leukemia virus (MLV): xenotropic (X),
ecotropic (E), amphotropic (A), and polytropic (P). X- and E-MLV cannot
exogenously infect mouse cells and are inherited as part of the mouse
genome. While X-MLV can infect other mammalian species but not cells
from laboratory mice, A- (see SLC20A2; 158378) and P-MLV can infect
mouse and other species. See Levy (1999) for a review of MLVs.

By cloning a human T-lymphocyte cDNA library into a retroviral vector,
transducing the library into naturally X-MLV-resistant mouse
fibroblasts, and PCR amplification, Tailor et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA
encoding XPR1. Expression of XPR1 in mouse and hamster MLV-resistant
fibroblasts rendered the cells susceptible to both X- and P-MLV. The
deduced 696-amino acid XPR1 protein contains 8 or 9 potential
membrane-spanning regions, 7 potential N-glycosylation sites, and 7
dileucines that may stimulate endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.5-kb XPR1 transcript in all tissues
tested, with highest expression in pancreas, kidney, placenta,
hematopoietic tissues, and heart, and lowest expression in skeletal
muscle. Expression of XPR1 was greater in fetal liver than adult liver.
A 9.5-kb XPR1 transcript was also detected in all tissues tested except
liver and bone marrow.

Using methods similar to those of Tailor et al. (1999), Battini et al.
(1999) isolated a cDNA encoding XPR1. Sequence analysis predicted that
XPR1, which shares 25% amino acid identity with the yeast Syg1 protein,
contains a 236-amino acid, hydrophilic N-terminal region that precedes
the 8 hydrophobic domains.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Battini et al. (1999) mapped the XPR1 gene
to 1q25.1, flanked by the AT3 (107300) and LAMC1 (150290) genes. Yang et
al. (1999) and Tailor et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Xpr1 gene, also
called Rmc1, to chromosome 1.

VITAMIN B12-BINDING PROTEIN 1;;

B12-BINDING ALPHA-GLOBULIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

There are 3 types of human vitamin B12-binding proteins: gastric
intrinsic factor (GIF; 609342), also known as transcobalamin III; plasma
transcobalamin II (TCN2; 613441); and transcobalamin I (TCN1), an R
binder protein. R binder proteins are a class of immunologically
identical but electrophoretically distinct glycoproteins found in many
secretions, such as saliva, gastric juice, tears, milk and leukocytes,
and differ only in their carbohydrate content; 'R' denotes 'rapid,'
referring to electrophoretic mobility (Azen and Denniston, 1979).
Transcobalamin I is also found in neutrophils, where it is restricted to
the secondary granules (Johnston et al., 1989).

CLONING

Johnston et al. (1989) isolated and characterized full-length cDNA
clones encoding the TCN1 gene from a human granulocyte cDNA library. The
deduced 433-residue protein showed extensive areas of homology with rat
gastric intrinsic factor, which implicated regions potentially important
for vitamin B12 binding.

GENE STRUCTURE

Johnston et al. (1992) determined that the TCN1 gene contains 9 exons.
Comparison of the genomic structures of TCN1 and GIF suggested that the
2 genes arose by a gene duplication.

MAPPING

Yang-Feng et al. (1991) mapped the TCN1 gene to chromosome 11q11-q12 by
in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Azen and Denniston (1979) demonstrated genetic polymorphism of the
vitamin B12-binding proteins. Data on gene frequencies of allelic
variants were tabulated by Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

;;TUMOR- AND MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; TMAP;;
LB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CKAP2 is a cytoskeleton-associated protein involved in mitotic
progression (Seki and Fang, 2007).

CLONING

By differential screening of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, followed by
database analysis, RT-PCR, and screening a human Jurkat T-cell cDNA
library, Maouche-Chretien et al. (1998) cloned CKAP2, which they called
LB1. The transcript contains 2 consensus polyadenylation signals and an
AU-rich mRNA-destabilizing motif. The deduced 683-amino acid protein has
a leucine- and isoleucine-rich domain and numerous potential
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected variable
expression of a major 3.6- to 3.9-kb transcript and a minor 2.2-kb
transcript in all human tissues and cell lines examined. In vitro
transcription/translation produced a protein with an apparent molecular
mass of 85 kD by SDS-PAGE. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected
COS cells showed that epitope-tagged CKAP2 localized to cytoplasmic
cytoskeletal filaments.

By differential display-PCR of primary human gastric adenocarcinomas,
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bae et al. (2003) cloned
full-length CKAP2 and a shorter variant, CKAP2S, resulting from
alternative splicing in exon 6. The full-length CKAP2 protein contains
682 amino acids, and the CKAP2S protein contains 494 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis showed that CKAP2 expression was higher in brain,
thymus, kidney, and placenta than in heart, skeletal muscle, lung,
leukocytes, and gastrointestinal tract. A second, smaller transcript was
detected in tissues with high CKAP2 expression. Endogenous CKAP2 and
fluorescence-tagged CKAP2 associated with the microtubule-organizing
center and with microtubules in HeLa cells, and this localization was
lost following treatment with a microtubule-destabilizing agent. Western
blot analysis detected endogenous CKAP2 at an apparent molecular mass of
75 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Maouche-Chretien et al. (1998) found that expression of LB1 was
upregulated in a patient with an immunoblastic subtype of diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma and in a patient with a multilobated centroblastic
subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In contrast, expression was
low or undetectable in 4 patients with polymorphic centroblastic diffuse
large B-cell lymphomas.

Using ribonuclease protection assays and RT-PCR, Bae et al. (2003) found
that CKAP2 and CKAP2S expression was upregulated in gastric tumor
tissues compared with matched normal mucosa. Immunohistochemical
analysis detected no CKAP2 protein in normal gastric mucosa, but it was
detected in all gastric adenocarcinomas and tubular adenomas examined.

Jeon et al. (2006) found that CKAP2 was not expressed in G0/G1-arrested
human foreskin fibroblasts, but that it was expressed in actively
dividing cells, gradually increasing between late G1 and G2/M. Knockdown
of CKAP2 reduced RB1 (614041) phosphorylation and increased p27 (CDKN1B;
600778) expression, and consequently reduced cell proliferation, whereas
constitutive CKAP2 expression increased RB phosphorylation and enhanced
proliferation.

The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C; see 608473) is a
ubiquitin ligase that controls sister chromatid separation and exit from
mitosis. It recognizes 2 motifs in its substrates: the destruction (D)
box and the KEN box. Seki and Fang (2007) found that CKAP2 was degraded
by CDH1 (192090)-activated APC/C in Xenopus interphase extracts, but not
in mitotic extracts. CKAP2 contains 4 D boxes and a KEN box, and
mutation analysis showed that only the KEN box was required for
ubiquitination by APC/C-CDH1 and degradation in CDH1-activated
interphase extracts. Overexpression of CDH1 in HeLa cells reduced CKAP2
levels in a KEN box-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of CDH1
increased the half-life of CKAP2. CKAP2 associated with centrosomal
microtubules in late G2 in HeLa cells, but only after separation of
duplicated centrosomes. During mitosis, CKAP2 associated with spindle
poles and with spindle microtubules from prophase through anaphase and
disappeared from microtubules during cytokinesis. Knockdown of CKAP2 did
not alter the cell cycle distribution of cells or generate mitotic
effects. On the other hand, ectopic expression of either wildtype CKAP2
or a nondegradable CKAP2 mutant led to mitotic arrest with monopolar
spindles containing highly bundled microtubules. Seki and Fang (2007)
concluded that regulation of CKAP2 by APC/C is critical for normal
mitotic progression.

MAPPING

By FISH, Maouche-Chretien et al. (1998) mapped the CKAP2 gene to
chromosome 13q14.

DESCRIPTION

Aromatase (EC 1.14.14.1), also called estrogen synthetase, is a member
of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion
of androgen to estrogen, a rate-limiting step in estrogen biosynthesis
(Harada et al., 1992).

CLONING

In reviewing the regulation of expression of P450 genes, Whitlock (1986)
discussed P450-aromatase, which is induced by follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH; see 136530) via formation of cyclic AMP. Presumably the
increased activity reflects increased transcription of the
P450-aromatase gene. Aromatase is present in many tissues including
skin, muscle, fat, and nerve, where it may contribute to sex-specific
differences in cellular metabolism.

Chen et al. (1986) and Evans et al. (1986) cloned and sequenced partial
human placental cDNAs corresponding to the aromatase gene. Evans et al.
(1986) found that the radiolabeled aromatase cDNA hybridized to several
size species of mRNA in both placental and adipose stromal cell RNA
fractions.

Harada (1988) isolated a complete cDNA clone encoding human aromatase
from a placenta cDNA library. A study of the deduced 503-amino acid
sequence and a comparison with other forms of cytochrome P450 indicated
that this enzyme is a unique member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily.

Corbin et al. (1988) also cloned a full-length human cDNA for
P450-aromatase encoding a deduced 503-amino acid protein with striking
similarity to other members of the cytochrome P450 gene superfamily.
Corbin et al. (1988) expressed the cDNA in COS-1 monkey kidney tumor
cells and found that the expressed protein was similar in size to human
placental aromatase, as detected by immunoblot analysis, and catalyzed
the aromatization of all 3 major physiologic substrates:
androstenedione, testosterone, and 16-alpha-hydroxyandrostenedione. The
activity was inhibited by known aromatase inhibitors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Toda et al. (1990) found that the CYP19 gene spans at least 70 kb of
genomic DNA and contains 10 exons. The translational initiation site and
the termination site are located in exon 2 and exon 10, respectively.

By analysis of overlapping BAC clones identified by homology searching
of public databases, Sebastian and Bulun (2001) determined the
organization of the CYP19 gene. Their analysis shows that the entire
gene spans more than 123 kb of DNA. Only the 30-kb 3-prime region
encodes aromatase, whereas a large 93-kb 5-prime flanking region serves
as the regulatory unit of the gene. The most proximal promoters, the
ovarian-specific promoter II and 2 other proximal promoters, I.3
(expressed in adipose tissue and breast cancer) and I.6 (expressed in
bone), are located within 1 kb of the translation start site.

Sebastian et al. (2002) stated that the CYP19 gene contains 9
alternative untranslated first exons, each with an individual promoter.
They identified a tenth alternative first exon, exon I.7. Exon I.7
contains no TATA or CAAT boxes, but it has 2 consensus GATA (see GATA1;
305371) motifs and other cis-acting motifs.

MAPPING

Sparkes et al. (1987) used the CYP19 cDNA identified by Chen et al.
(1986) in the study of human/mouse somatic cell hybrids for assignment
of the gene to human chromosome 15. By in situ hybridization, Chen et
al. (1988) mapped the ARO gene to 15q21.1.

Using data from the Human Genome Project and screening a BAC plasmid
library, Shozu et al. (2003) mapped the CGNL1 gene (607856), the
tropomodulin-3 gene (TMOD3; 605112), and the aromatase gene, in that
order from telomere to centromere, to 15q21.1-q21.3. They found that the
aromatase gene is normally transcribed in the direction opposite to that
of TMOD3 and CGNL1.

GENE FUNCTION

Aromatase is located in the ovary and placenta and participates in the
regulation of reproductive functions. The enzyme is also widely
distributed in extragonadal tissues such as muscle, liver, hair
follicles, adipose tissue, and brain. This finding suggests that
estrogen produced by this enzyme has physiologic functions not only as a
sex steroid hormone but also in growth or differentiation (summary by
Harada et al., 1992).

Zhou et al. (1991) studied structure-function relationships in human
aromatase using site-directed mutagenesis and a stable expression system
that involved a plasmid containing human placenta aromatase cDNA in
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. A phe406-to-arg mutant was completely
inactive. Only small changes in enzyme kinetics occurred with mutants
tyr361 to phe and tyr361 to leu, leading to the conclusion that tyr361
is not directly involved in substrate binding. The mutant pro308 to phe
had altered catalytic properties, suggesting that pro308 is situated in
the active site of the enzyme.

Biosynthesis of estrogens from C19 steroids is catalyzed by aromatase
and its tissue-specific expression is determined at least in part by
alternative use of tissue-specific promoters, which give rise to
transcripts with unique 5-prime noncoding termini. The distal promoter
(I.1) is responsible for expression uniquely in the placenta, while the
proximal promoter (II), which regulates expression via a cAMP-dependent
signaling pathway, is responsible for expression in the gonads.
Transcripts in breast adipose tissue contain 5-prime termini
corresponding to expression derived from use of promoters I.4
predominantly as well as II and I.3. Promoter I.4 contains a
glucocorticoid response element and an interferon-gamma activation site
element, and is responsible for expression in the presence of
glucocorticoids and members of the class I cytokine family. Agarwal et
al. (1997) determined the distribution of these various transcripts in
adipose tissue from abdomen, buttocks, and thighs of women to
characterize the factors regulating aromatase expression in these sites.
They used competitive RT-PCR to amplify unique 5-prime ends of each of
the transcripts of the CYP19 gene expressed and the coding region to
evaluate total transcript levels in adipose tissue . They found that
exon I.4-specific transcripts were predominant in adipose tissue
obtained from women regardless of the tissue site or the age of the
individual. They also found that transcript levels increased in direct
proportion to advancing age and were the highest in buttocks, followed
by thighs, and lowest in abdomen adipose tissue. Thus it appears that in
normal human adipose tissue, aromatase expression is mainly under local
control by a number of cytokines via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms
in the presence of systemic glucocorticoids.

The distinct gender-specific patterns of fat distribution in men and
women (android and gynoid) suggest a role for sex steroids. It has been
suggested that estrogens can promote preadipocyte cell proliferation
and/or differentiation. The enzyme CYP19 is responsible for the
conversion of androgen precursor steroids to estrogens and may,
therefore, have a role in regulating adipose tissue mass and its
distribution. McTernan et al. (2002) investigated the glucocorticoid
regulation of aromatase expression in adipose tissue, specifically to
define any site- and gender-specific differences. Abdominal subcutaneous
and omental adipose tissue was obtained from male and female patients
undergoing elective surgery. Cortisol-induced aromatase activity in
omental adipocytes from postmenopausal females was higher than that in
premenopausal females (P less than 0.001). Insulin had no independent
effect on aromatase expression, but coincubation of preadipocytes with
cortisol and insulin eliminated both gender- and site-specific
differences. The authors concluded that in women, but not men, cortisol
increases aromatase activity at subcutaneous sites, and this may
facilitate predilection for subcutaneous adiposity in females. They
suggested that the observed site-, gender-, and menopausal-specific
differences in the glucocorticoid regulation of this enzyme may
contribute to the gender- and menopausal-specific patterns of fat
distribution.

By standards of other CYP genes, CYP19 is extraordinarily large (more
than 50 kb). The large size of the gene is probably related to the
transcription of CYP19 in different cell types under the regulation of
different promoters. Simpson et al. (1997) summarized their findings of
several distinct CYP19 promoters with alternative splicing which leads
to the production of the same enzyme in all cells. Numerous untranslated
first exons occur in aromatase transcripts in a tissue-specific fashion
due to differential splicing as a consequence of the use of
tissue-specific promoters. Thus, expression in the ovary uses a proximal
promoter that is regulated primarily by cAMP. On the other hand,
expression in the placenta uses a distal promoter located at least 40 kb
upstream of the start of transcription that is regulated by retinoids.
Other promoters are used in brain and adipose tissue. In the latter
case, class I cytokines such as IL6 (147620) and IL11 (147681), as well
as TNF-alpha (TNFA; 191160), are important regulatory factors. A common
3-prime splice junction located upstream of the start of translation is
used in all of the splicing events involved in the use of these various
promoters. Thus, the coding region of the transcripts, and hence the
protein, are identical regardless of the tissue site of expression; what
differs in a tissue-specific fashion is the 5-prime end of the
transcripts. This pattern of expression has great significance both from
a phylogenetic and ontogenetic standpoint, as well as for the physiology
and pathophysiology of estrogen formation.

Wang et al. (2001) presented the results of in vivo and in vitro
analyses indicating that aromatase is a physiologic target of DAX1
(NR0B1; 300473) in Leydig cells, and that increased aromatase expression
may account, in part, for the infertility and Leydig cell hyperplasia in
Dax1-deficient mice.

Aquila et al. (2002) noted that testicular expression of CYP19 has been
shown in both somatic and germ cell types in several species, whereas in
humans, testicular expression is confined to the somatic cells. They
investigated whether CYP19 is present in human ejaculated spermatozoa.
Using RT-PCR and specific primers, they amplified the highly conserved
helical, aromatic, and heme-binding sequences of the conventional human
CYP19 from RNA isolated from human spermatozoa. Employing a rabbit
polyclonal antiserum directed against human placental CYP19,
immunoblotting analysis demonstrated aromatase protein expression, which
was localized primarily to the tail and midpiece of spermatozoa. Aquila
et al. (2002) concluded that human spermatozoa are a potential site of
estrogen biosynthesis.

Using RT-PCR and semiquantitative RT-PCR, Sebastian et al. (2002) found
that CYP19 variants containing exon I.7, an alternative untranslated
first exon, were highly expressed in some subcutaneous adipose tissue
samples, but not in normal breast adipose tissue or any other normal
tissue examined. Exon I.7-containing CPY19 was highly expressed in
breast cancer tissue and in breast adipose tissue adjacent to cancer.

Sebastian et al. (2002) determined that the 2 consensus GATA sites
within the promoter region of alternative exon I.7 were critical for
basal CYP19 promoter activity in human microvascular endothelial cells.
GATA2 (137295), but not GATA1, bound the GATA sites and activated
expression of a reporter gene in a concentration-dependent manner.

In human endometriotic stromal cells, markedly high levels of CYP19 mRNA
and promoter II activity are present and can be vigorously stimulated by
prostaglandin-E2 via a cAMP-dependent pathway to give rise to
physiologically significant estrogen biosynthesis. Yang et al. (2002)
evaluated the possible roles of C/EBP isoforms in the regulation of
P450-aromatase expression in endometriotic versus eutopic endometrial
stromal cells. They disrupted several potential sequences and found that
mutations of a -211/-197-bp cAMP-response element (CRE) and a
-317/-304-bp C/EBP binding site abolished both baseline and cAMP-induced
promoter II activity. The authors concluded that both -317/-304 and
-211/-197-bp elements in promoter II are critical for the robust
cAMP-dependent induction in endometriosis. C/EBP-alpha upregulates,
whereas C/EBP-beta and C/EBP-delta inhibit, P450-aromatase promoter
activity via binding primarily to the -211/-197-bp CRE under in vitro
conditions. In vivo downregulation of C/EBP-beta in endometriotic
stromal cells and its upregulation in endometrial stromal cells may in
part account for the induction of CYP19 expression in endometriosis and
its inhibition in endometrium.

Shozu et al. (2002) noted that the CYP19 gene is expressed in several
extragonadal sites and regulated in a tissue-specific fashion, which is
achieved by alternative use of the 7 different promoters, and
corresponding exons 1, of the CYP19 gene. To elucidate the mechanism by
which aromatase P450 is overexpressed in leiomyomas, they sought to
determine the promoter used for aromatase P450 expression in leiomyomas.
By 5-prime-RACE analysis Shozu et al. (2002) revealed that of 6
leiomyoma nodules tested, 4 contained I.4-specific transcript of
aromatase P450 alone, 1 contained PII-specific transcript alone, and the
remaining nodule contained both I.4- and PII-specific transcripts
simultaneously. The transcriptional ability of the promoter I.4 sequence
was confirmed by transient transfection assay using primary cells
released from leiomyomas and established cells from normal myometrium
(KW cells). Luciferase vectors containing promoter I.4 sequence
(-340/+14 or longer) showed a significant increase in luciferase
activity in response to dexamethasone. Deletion or mutation of a
putative glucocorticoid-responsive element in the promoter I.4 sequence
eliminated promoter activity. The authors concluded that promoter I.4 is
the major promoter responsible for overexpression of aromatase P450 in
leiomyomas and that a glucocorticoid-responsive element within it plays
a substantial role in the expression of aromatase P450.

Imir et al. (2007) reported that aromatase expression is regulated via
the alternatively used promoters in the placenta (I.1 and I.2a), fat
(I.4, I.3, and II), bone (I.6), and gonads (II). A prostaglandin
E2/cAMP-dependent pathway regulates coordinately the proximal promoters
I.3/II, whereas glucocorticoids and cytokines regulate the distal
promoter I.4. They demonstrated that aromatase expression in leiomyoma
tissue in vivo is primarily regulated by the promoter I.3/II region
rather than I.4.

Ishikawa et al. (2008) demonstrated that cAMP-induced binding of
CEBP-beta (189965) to multiple motifs in the CYP19 promoter I.3/II
region is a critical mechanism regulating aromatase expression in
leiomyoma smooth muscle cells in primary culture. The authors concluded
that definition of this mechanism further may assist in designing
inhibitors of aromatase specific for leiomyoma tissue.

Parakh et al. (2006) found that expression of beta-catenin (CTNNB1;
116806) lacking the N-terminal 90-amino acids that lead to its
degradation significantly enhanced FSH-mediated induction of CYP19A1 and
CYP11A1 (118485) mRNA. CYP19A1 transactivation by SF1 (601516) required
a functional interaction with beta-catenin and an intact
beta-catenin-binding site. The beta-catenin-binding site was also
critical for the synergistic actions of FSH and SF1 on CYP19A1. The
actions of beta-catenin on CYP19A1 were dependent on hormone-induced
cAMP cascades. Parakh et al. (2006) concluded that beta-catenin is
essential for FSH/cAMP-regulated gene expression in ovary and that
beta-catenin has a role in estrogen biosynthesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Diaz-Cruz et al. (2005) studied the effects of nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs and COX1 (176805)- and COX2 (600262)-selective
inhibitors on aromatase activity and expression in human breast cancer
cells. The data from these experiments revealed dose-dependent decreases
in aromatase activity after treatment with all agents. Real-time PCR
analysis of aromatase gene expression showed a significant decrease in
mRNA levels when compared with control for all agents. These results
were consistent with enzyme activity data, suggesting that the effect of
COX inhibitors on aromatase begins at the transcriptional level.
Exon-specific real-time PCR studies suggested that promoters I.3, I.4,
and II are involved in this process.

- Crystal Structure

Ghosh et al. (2009) presented the crystal structure of human placental
aromatase, the only natural mammalian full-length P450, and the first
P450 in hormone biosynthetic pathways to be crystallized. Unlike the
active sites of many microsomal P450s that metabolize drugs and
xenobiotics, aromatase has an androgen-specific cleft that binds the
androstenedione molecule snugly. Hydrophobic and polar residues
exquisitely complement the steroid backbone. The locations of
catalytically important residues shed light on the reaction mechanism.
The relative juxtaposition of the hydrophobic amino-terminal region and
the opening to the catalytic cleft shows why membrane anchoring is
necessary for the lipophilic substrates to gain access to the active
site. Ghosh et al. (2009) suggested that the molecular basis for the
enzyme's androgenic specificity and unique catalytic mechanisms can be
used for developing next-generation aromatase inhibitors.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Aromatase Deficiency

In an 18-year-old 46,XX female with aromatase deficiency (613546), Ito
et al. (1993) described compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
CYP19A1 gene (107910.0001-107910.0002). They indicated that this was the
first definitive case of an adult with aromatase deficiency to be
reported.

Harada et al. (1992) demonstrated that the aromatase deficiency in the
case reported by Shozu et al. (1991) was caused by the expression of an
abnormal aromatase protein molecule resulting from a genetic defect in
the fetus. Specifically, the CYP19A1 gene was found to have an insert of
87 bp, encoding 29 amino acids in-frame with no termination codon
(107910.0003). By transient expression in COS-7 cells, the aromatase
cDNA of the patient was found to contain a protein with a trace of
activity. Harada et al. (1992) suggested that the defect in the
placental aromatase gene, a feature of the infant's genotype, might be
inherited since the parents were consanguineous in the 'fifth degree.'
They showed that the offspring was homozygous for a defect that was
present in heterozygous state in both parents (107910.0003).

In a brother and sister with aromatase deficiency, Morishima et al.
(1995) identified homozygosity for a mutation in the aromatase gene
(107910.0004).

- Aromatase Excess Syndrome

In 3 patients with gynecomastia due to increased aromatase activity
(139300), Shozu et al. (2003) identified 2 distinct heterozygous
inversions in 15q21.2-q21.3 that resulted in a cryptic promoter in the
aromatase gene, including part of the TMOD3 or CGNL1 promoter,
respectively, and caused estrogen excess; see 107910.0010 and
107910.0011.

- Breast Cancer Susceptibility

Siegelmann-Danieli and Buetow (1999) genotyped 348 Caucasian women with
breast cancer (114480) and 145 Caucasian women controls for a published
tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism in intron 4 of the CYP19 gene. Six
common and 2 rare alleles were identified. The 171-bp allele was
overrepresented in patients; of 14 individuals homozygous for this
allele, 13 were patients. The control individual homozygous for this
allele was a 46-year-old woman. The 171-bp allele was found to be
associated with a silent polymorphism (G-to-A at val80). The
relationship between the high-risk allele and cancer development
remained to be elucidated.

Haiman et al. (2003) employed a haplotype-based approach to search for
breast cancer-associated CYP19 variants in the Multiethnic Cohort Study
(MEC). The authors observed significant haplotype effects, and also
found a common long-range haplotype that was associated with increased
risk of breast cancer. The authors hypothesized that women with the
long-range CYP19 haplotype 2b-3c may be carriers of a predisposing
breast cancer susceptibility allele.

Among 5,356 patients with invasive breast cancer and 7,129 controls
composed primarily of white women of European descent, Haiman et al.
(2007) found that common haplotypes spanning the coding and proximal
5-prime region of the CYP19A1 gene were significantly associated with a
10 to 20% increase in endogenous estrogen levels in postmenopausal
women. The effect per copy of the A-A haplotype of SNPs dbSNP rs749292
and dbSNP rs727479 was the most significant (p = 4.4 x 10(-15)),
although this accounted for less than 2% of the variation in estrogen
levels. No significant associations with these SNPs or other common
haplotypes were observed for breast cancer risk. Haiman et al. (2007)
concluded that although genetic variation in CYP19A1 produced measurable
differences in estrogen levels among postmenopausal women, the magnitude
of the change was insufficient to contribute detectably to breast
cancer.

- Height

To determine whether CYP19 gene or Y chromosome loci are associated with
variation in height, Ellis et al. (2001) performed an association study
using common biallelic polymorphisms in CYP19 and the Y chromosome in
413 adult males and 335 females drawn at random from a large population
sample. An association between CYP19 and height was found, but this was
more evident in men than in women. An association was also found with
the Y chromosome. Additionally, when men were grouped according to
haplotypes of the CYP19 and Y chromosome polymorphisms, a difference of
4.2 cm was detected. The authors concluded that in men, genetic
variation in CYP19 and on the Y chromosome are involved in determining
normal adult height, and that these loci may interact in an additive
fashion.

- Bone Mineral Density

To assess the role of bioavailable estradiol and the CYP19 TTTA(n)
repeat polymorphism in bone loss in elderly men, van Pottelbergh et al.
(2003) performed a longitudinal study in a cohort of 214 healthy
community-dwelling men aged 70 to 86. Bioavailable estrogen was
consistently associated with prospectively assessed bone mineral density
(BMD) changes at all measured sites. Moreover, the CYP19 TTTA(n) repeat
polymorphism was an additional independent determinant of BMD changes at
the distal forearm. Furthermore, the CYP19 genotype was associated with
self-reported clinical fracture risk as well as fracture history in
first-degree relatives. The authors concluded that the results of this
study provided an indication that the aromatase enzyme may exert a
direct modulatory action on bone metabolism at the tissue level in
elderly men.

Gennari et al. (2004) studied the role of the TTTA repeat polymorphism
in intron 4 of the CYP19 gene as a genetic determinant of BMD in a
sample of elderly males who were recruited by direct mailing and
followed longitudinally. Men with a high repeat genotype (more than 9
repeats) showed higher lumbar BMD values, lower bone turnover markers,
higher estradiol levels, and a lower rate of BMD change than men with a
low repeat genotype (fewer than 9 repeats). The association with BMD was
not significant in the subgroup of patients with high body mass index
(greater than 25), suggesting that the effect of CYP19 genotypes on bone
may be masked by the increase in fat mass. Gennari et al. (2004)
concluded that differences in estrogen levels due to polymorphism at the
aromatase CYP19 gene may predispose men to increased age-related bone
loss and fracture risk.

In a case-control study of 252 postmenopausal women aged 64.5 +/- 9.2
years (mean +/- SD), Somner et al. (2004) studied the association
between 2 common polymorphisms in the CYP17 (609300) and CYP19 genes,
-34T-C (Zmuda et al., 2001) and a silent G-to-A transition at val80 in
exon 3 (Siegelmann-Danieli and Buetow, 1999), respectively, and bone
mineral density (BMD) and serum androgen/estradiol. There was no
significant difference in serum estradiol concentrations between
osteoporosis cases and controls. The CYP19 genotype was significantly
associated with serum estradiol (P = 0.002). Women with the AA genotype
had higher serum estradiol concentrations compared with those with the
GG genotype (P = 0.03). In older women, those with CYP19 GA and GG
genotypes had an increased prevalence of osteoporosis (P = 0.04) and
fractures (P = 0.003). Somner et al. (2004) found no significant
association between CYP17 genotype and serum androgens and estradiol
concentrations. However, a significant association was seen between BMD
values at the femoral neck with CYP17 genotype in cases (P = 0.04) and
in the whole study population (P = 0.012). Subjects with the CC genotype
had significantly lower BMD (mean +/- SD: TT, 0.7 +/- 0.16; CC, 0.6 +/-
0.08 g/cm2; P = 0.006). Somner et al. (2004) concluded that both CYP17
and CYP19 are candidate genes for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

In a case-control study of 135 women with vertebral fractures due to
postmenopausal osteoporosis and 312 controls, Riancho et al. (2007)
studied 4 SNPs of the CYP19A1 gene (dbSNP rs1062033, dbSNP rs767199,
dbSNP rs4775936, and dbSNP rs700518) and identified a common haplotype,
present in about half the population, that was associated with an
increased risk of fracture (OR, 1.8, p = 0.006). Total aromatase
expression was 4 times lower in fat samples from homozygotes for the
unfavorable alleles than in the opposite homozygotes (p = 0.007).

ANIMAL MODEL

Leshin et al. (1981) showed that a similar lesion exists in the henny
feathering trait of Sebright Bantam chickens. Further, they concluded
that this trait results from a regulatory mutation affecting aromatase
activity ( Leshin et al., 1981). George et al. (1990) showed that the
henny feathering trait in the Golden Campine chicken is identical to
that in the Sebright Bantam; indeed, it may be the same gene, the trait
in the Campine having been derived from the Sebright. In the chicken the
trait behaves as an incomplete dominant; heterozygotes express half the
levels of extraglandular aromatase as do homozygotes on average.

Fisher et al. (1998) generated mice lacking functional aromatase enzyme
by targeted disruption of the cyp19 gene. Male and female knockout mice
were born with the expected mendelian frequency from F1 parents and grew
to adulthood. At 9 weeks of age, female knockout mice displayed
underdeveloped external genitalia and uteri. Ovaries contained numerous
follicles with abundant granulosa cells and evidence of antrum formation
that appeared arrested before ovulation. No corpora lutea were present.
Additionally, the stroma were hyperplastic with structures that appeared
to be atretic follicles. Development of the mammary glands approximated
that of prepubertal females. Male mice of the same age showed
essentially normal internal anatomy, but the male accessory sex glands
were enlarged because of increased content of secreted material. The
testes appeared normal. Male knockout mice were capable of breeding and
produced litters of approximately average size. Whereas serum estradiol
levels were at the limit of detection, testosterone levels were
elevated, as were the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and
luteinizing hormone (see 152780). The phenotype of these animals
differed markedly from that of the previously reported estrogen receptor
knockout mice in which the estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1; 133430) was
deleted by targeted disruption.

Robertson et al. (1999) investigated spermatogenesis in mice that lack
aromatase because of the targeted disruption of the cyp19 gene. Male
mice deficient in aromatase were initially fertile but developed
progressive infertility, until their ability to sire pups was severely
impaired. The mice deficient in aromatase developed disruptions to
spermatogenesis between 4.5 months and 1 year, despite no decreases in
gonadotropins or androgens. Spermatogenesis primarily was arrested at
early spermiogenic stages, as characterized by an increase in apoptosis
and the appearance of multinucleated cells, and there was a significant
reduction in round and elongated spermatids, but no changes in Sertoli
cells or early germ cells. In addition, Leydig cell
hyperplasia/hypertrophy was evident, presumably as a consequence of
increased circulating luteinizing hormone. The findings indicated that
local expression of aromatase is essential for spermatogenesis and
provided evidence for a direct action of estrogen on male germ cell
development and thus fertility.

Aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice, lacking a functional Cyp19 gene, cannot
synthesize endogenous estrogens. Jones et al. (2000) examined the
adipose deposits of male and female ArKO mice, observing that these
animals progressively accumulated significantly more intraabdominal
adipose tissue than their wildtype littermates, reflected in increased
adipocyte volume at gonadal and infrarenal sites. This increased
adiposity was not due to hyperphagia or reduced resting energy
expenditure, but was associated with reduced spontaneous physical
activity levels, reduced glucose oxidation, and a decrease in lean body
mass. A striking accumulation of lipid droplets was observed in the
livers of ArKO animals. The findings demonstrated an important role for
estrogen in the maintenance of lipid homeostasis in both males and
females. Along the same lines, Heine et al. (2000) studied male and
female Esr1 knockout mice and found that signaling by this receptor is
critical in female and male white adipose tissue. Obesity in the males
involved a mechanism of reduced energy expenditure rather than increased
energy intake.

Yue et al. (2005) generated APP23 mice (see 104760), a mouse model of
Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300), that were also estrogen-deficient due to
heterozygous disruption of the aromatase gene. Compared to control APP23
mice with normal aromatase activity, the estrogen-deficient mice showed
decreased brain estrogen, earlier onset of amyloid plaques, and
increased brain beta-amyloid deposition. Microglia cultures from these
mice showed impaired beta-amyloid clearance. In contrast, ovariectomized
APP23 mice had normal brain estrogen levels and showed plaque pathology
similar to control APP23 mice. In addition, Yue et al. (2005) found that
postmortem brain tissue from 10 female AD patients showed 60% and 85%
decreased levels of total and free estrogen, respectively, as well as
decreased levels of aromatase mRNA compared to 10 female controls.
However, serum estrogen levels were not different between the 2 groups.
Yue et al. (2005) concluded that reduced brain estrogen production may
be a risk factor for developing AD neuropathology.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AROMATASE DEFICIENCY
CYP19A1, ARG435CYS

Ito et al. (1993) described compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in
the CYP19 gene in a patient with aromatase deficiency (613546) suspected
on the basis of clinical and biochemical evidence. The patient was an
18-year-old 46,XX female with sexual infantilism, primary amenorrhea,
ambiguous external genitalia at birth, and polycystic ovaries. Coding
exons 2 to 10 of the CYP19 gene were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA
and sequenced directly. In exon 10, a C-to-T transition at bp 1303
resulted in a change of arginine-435 to cysteine (R435C). The results of
RFLP analysis and direct sequencing of the amplified exon 10 DNA from
the patient's mother indicated maternal inheritance of the R435C
mutation. The other mutation, inherited from the father, was a G-to-A
transition in exon 10 at bp 1310 resulting in a change of cysteine-437
to tyrosine (C436Y; 107210.0002). Transient expression experiments
showed that the R435C mutant protein had approximately 1.1% of the
activity of the wildtype, whereas C437Y was totally inactive.

CYP19A1, IVS6, T-C, +2

Shozu et al. (1991) observed progressive virilization of a primigravida
during pregnancy, as well as female pseudohermaphroditism of her baby,
and showed that these conditions were caused by deficiency of placental
aromatase activity (613546). Harada et al. (1992) showed that the
aromatase gene from the placenta was transcribed as an abnormally large
mRNA with an 87-bp insertion and was translated as an abnormally large
protein molecule with 29 extra amino acids, resulting in an almost
inactive enzyme. Harada et al. (1992) showed that the splice donor
sequence (GT) of intron 6 in controls was mutated to GC in the patient,
whereas the parents showed both GT and GC, indicating their heterozygous
state.

CYP19A1, ARG375CYS

Morishima et al. (1995) described a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1123
in exon IX of the CYP19 gene in a 28-year-old XX proband and her
24-year-old XY sib. The mother of the proband exhibited signs of
progressive virilization during both pregnancies that regressed
postpartum. The XX proband, followed since infancy, exhibited the
cardinal features of aromatase deficiency (613546). She had nonadrenal
female pseudohermaphroditism at birth and underwent repair of the
external genitalia, including a clitorectomy. At puberty, she developed
progressive signs of virilization, pubertal failure with no signs of
estrogen action, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, polycystic ovaries on
pelvic sonography, and tall stature. The basal concentrations of plasma
testosterone, androstenedione, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone were elevated,
whereas plasma estradiol was low. Hormone replacement therapy led to
breast development, menses, resolution of ovarian cysts, and suppression
of the elevated FSH and LH values. Her adult height was 177.6 cm. Her
brother was 204 cm tall with eunuchoid skeletal proportions. He was
sexually fully mature and had macroorchidism. The bone age was 14 years
at a chronologic age of 24 years. Striking osteopenia was noted at the
wrist and at other sites. The observations in these sibs were considered
consistent with the following interpretations by Morishima et al.
(1995): (1) estrogens are essential for normal skeletal maturation and
proportions (but not linear growth) in men as well as in women, the
accretion and maintenance of bone mineral density and mass, and the
control of the rate of bone turnover; (2) estrogens have a significant
role in the sex steroid-gonadotropin feedback mechanism in the male,
even in the face of high circulating testosterone; (3) deficient
estrogens in the adult male are associated with hyperinsulinemia and
abnormal plasma lipids; and (4) placental aromatase has a critical role
in protecting the female fetus from fetal masculinization and the
pregnant woman from virilization.

Bilezikian et al. (1998) found that treatment for 3 years with
conjugated estrogen resulted in restoration of bone mass in the patient
reported by Morishima et al. (1995).

CYP19A1, 1-BP DEL, C, CODON 408

Mullis et al. (1997) reported a female with aromatase deficiency
(613546) who was a compound heterozygote for 2 point mutations in the
CYP19 gene. The maternal allele had a basepair (C) deletion at codon 408
(CCC) that caused a frameshift resulting in a nonsense codon 111 bp (37
amino acids) 3-prime to the deletion. The paternal allele had a G-to-A
transition at the 5-prime splice site (conserved GT to AT) between exon
and intron 3 (IVS3+1G-A; 107910.0006). This mutation ignores the 5-prime
splice site resulting in a read-through to a stop codon 3 bp downstream.
Aromatase deficiency was suspected because of the marked prepartum
virilization in the mother, and the diagnosis was confirmed shortly
after birth. Extremely low levels of serum estrogens were found in
contrast to high levels of androgens. Ultrasonographic studies of the
child showed persistently enlarged ovaries containing numerous large
cysts and normal-appearing large tertiary follicles at 2 years of age.
Basal and GNRH-induced FSH levels remained strikingly elevated. Low-dose
estradiol given for 50 days at the age of 3.5 years resulted in
normalization of serum gonadotropin levels, regression of ovarian size,
and increase of whole body and lumbar spine bone mineral density. The
FSH levels and ovarian size returned to pretreatment levels 150 days
after cessation of estradiol therapy.

CYP19A1, ARG365GLN

In a man with aromatase deficiency (613546) whose parents were first
cousins, Carani et al. (1997) identified a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 1094 in exon 9 of the P-450 aromatase gene, resulting in a
glutamine instead of an arginine at codon 365. The mutation abolished a
site cleaved by the restriction enzyme Acc651; restriction analysis
showed that both parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Expression
studies in COS-1 cells showed that the aromatase activity of the mutant
protein was 0.4% of that of the wildtype protein in the presence of the
same amount of total cellular protein. At 18 years of age the patient
was 170 cm tall and he continued to grow, reaching a height of 187 cm at
the age of 31 and 190 cm at the age of 38. Androgen therapy was
ineffective; estrogen therapy resulted in increased spinal bone mineral
density and complete epiphyseal closure after 9 months. The increases in
bone mineral density, serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and
osteocalcin, and urinary excretion of pyridinoline were similar to those
that occurred during normal skeletal maturation during puberty. Thus,
the authors proposed that eunuchoid skeletal features may result mainly
from a deficiency of estrogen, rather than a deficiency of androgen. The
lack of eunuchoid skeletal development in patients with complete
androgen insensitivity supported this view. Skeletal pain, especially in
the knees, was a clinical feature. At age 31 years his arm span was 204
cm and the ratio of upper segment to lower segment was 0.85. He showed
bilateral genu valgum. There was no gynecomastia and penis size and
pattern of pubic hair were normal. Psychosexual orientation was
heterosexual and his libido and erections were normal.

AROMATASE DEFICIENCY
CYP19A1, 1-BP DEL, C, CODON 156

Deladoey et al. (1999) identified a point mutation in the CYP19 gene
that was responsible for aromatase deficiency (613546) in a 46,XY male
infant with unremarkable clinical findings at birth. The boy was
homozygous for a 1-bp deletion (codon 156, C) in exon 5 of the CYP19
gene. Aromatase deficiency was suspected prenatally because of the
severe virilization of the mother during the early pregnancy, and the
diagnosis was confirmed shortly after birth. Four weeks after birth, the
boy showed extremely low levels of serum estrogens but had a normal
level of serum free testosterone; in comparison with the high serum
concentration of androstenedione at birth, a striking decrease occurred
by 4 weeks postnatally. The authors had previously reported elevated
basal and stimulated FSH levels in a female infant with aromatase
deficiency in the first year of life. In contrast, in the male infant,
basal FSH and peak FSH levels after standard GnRH stimulation tests were
normal. The authors concluded that the contribution of estrogen to the
hypothalamic-pituitary gonadotropin-gonadal feedback mechanism is
different in boys and girls during infancy and early childhood. They
hypothesized that in normal girls serum estradiol concentrations
strongly correlate with circulating inhibin levels, and thus, low
inhibin levels may contribute to the striking elevation of FSH in young
girls with aromatase deficiency. In contrast, estradiol levels are
physiologically about 7-fold lower in boys than in girls, and serum
inhibin levels remain elevated even though levels of FSH, LH, and
testosterone are decreased.

CYP19A1, IVS4, C-A, -3

Herrmann et al. (2002) described a novel homozygous mutation in the
CYP19 gene in a 27-year-old male with aromatase deficiency (613546)
whose parents were consanguineous. A C-to-A substitution in intron 5 at
position -3 of the splicing acceptor site before exon 6 of the CYP19
gene is the likely cause of loss of aromatase activity. The mRNA of the
patient led to a frameshift and a premature stop codon 8 nucleotides
downstream at the end of exon 5. Apart from genua valga, kyphoscoliosis,
and pectus carinatum, the physical examination was normal, including
secondary male characteristics with normal testicular size. To
substitute for the deficiency, the patient was treated with 50 mg
transdermal estradiol twice weekly for 3 months, followed by 25 mg twice
weekly. Bone density of the distal radius increased and bone mineral
density of the lumbar spine increased. Semen analysis revealed
oligozoospermia. After 3 months of treatment, the sperm count increased
and decreased rapidly during the following 3 months. The authors
concluded that in this rare incidence of estrogen deficiency, estrogen
replacement demonstrated its importance for bone mineralization and
maturation and glucose metabolism in a male carrying a novel mutation in
the CYP19 gene.

AROMATASE EXCESS SYNDROME
CYP19A1, INV, CGNL1 PROMOTER

In a 36-year-old man and his 7-year-old son with severe gynecomastia of
prepubertal onset and mild hypogonadotropic hypogonadism caused by
elevated estrogen levels (139300), Shozu et al. (2003) identified an
inversion on 15q21.2-q21.3 that moved the promoter of the FLJ14957 gene
(CGNL1; 607856) into a 5-prime position in relation to the aromatase
coding region. The father in this case had progressive gynecomastia and
a linear growth spurt at the age of 5 years, which was quickly followed
by the development of pubic hair and penile enlargement. He stopped
growing at the age of 14 years when his height was below the first
percentile. He underwent bilateral mastectomy at the age of 16 years.
The son was born when the father was 30 years old. Physical examination
demonstrated a high-pitched voice, lack of facial hair, mastectomy
scars, and unremarkable external genitalia. In the son the gynecomastia
and accelerated linear growth likewise first occurred at the age of 5
years: his height and weight were above the 99th percentile, breast
development was Tanner stage III, and he had normal prepubertal external
genitalia. At the chronologic age of 5.5 years, his bone age was 13
years.

Shozu et al. (2003) demonstrated that severe gynecomastia of prepubertal
onset associated with elevated estrogen levels (139300) in a 17-year-old
boy was caused by an inversion in 15q21.2-q21.3 that brought the
promoter of the TMOD3 gene (605112) into a position immediately 5-prime
of the aromatase gene.

AROMATASE DEFICIENCY
CYP19A1, GLU210LYS

In a 29-year-old man with aromatase deficiency (613546), Maffei et al.
(2004) detected a homozygous G-to-A transition at the last nucleotide of
exon 5 of the CYP19A1 gene that resulted in a glu210-to-lys (E210K)
amino acid substitution. Continuing linear growth, eunuchoid body
proportions, diffuse bone pain, and bilateral cryptorchidism were
observed. The patient had a complex dysmetabolic syndrome characterized
by insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus type 2, acanthosis nigricans,
liver steatohepatitis, and signs of precocious atherogenesis.
Testosterone treatment at high doses resulted in a severe imbalance in
the estradiol-to-testosterone ratio together with insulin resistance and
diabetes mellitus type 2. Estrogen treatment resulted in an improvement
of acanthosis nigricans, insulin resistance, and liver steatohepatitis,
coupled with a better glycemic control and the disappearance of 2
carotid plaques. Testis biopsy showed a pattern of total germ cell
depletion that might be due to the concomitant presence of bilateral
cryptorchidism. The authors concluded that this case of aromatase
deficiency confirmed previous data on bone maturation and mineralization
and revealed a high risk for the precocious development of
cardiovascular disease in young aromatase-deficient men.

.0013
AROMATASE EXCESS SYNDROME
CYP19A1, CYP19A1/TRPM7 FUSION

In a Russian kindred with aromatase excess syndrome (139300) with 16
affected individuals in 5 generations, Tiulpakov et al. (2005) detected
heterozygosity for a novel chimeric transcript composed of exon 1 of the
TRPM7 gene (605692) spliced to the common acceptor splice site of CYP19
exon 2. This rearrangement was predicted to result in aberrant aromatase
expression driven by the TRPM7 promoter. In both sexes the disorder
manifested in early childhood with breast enlargement, growth, and bone
age acceleration. Tiulpakov et al. (2005) stated that the mechanism of
this chromosomal defect appeared to be different from that described by
Shozu et al. (2003) (see 107910.0010, 107910.0011), which most likely
were the result of heterozygous inversions. The CYP19 and TRPM7 genes
are transcribed in the same direction, with TRPM7 lying 3-prime
(downstream) of CYP19. Thus, rearrangement bringing CYP19 under the
control of the TRPM7 promoter could not result from simple inversion of
the 15q21.2 portion. A more complex heterozygous rearrangement such as
partial duplication of 15q21.2 with placing of the TRPM7 regulatory
regions in front of the CYP19 coding exons would be required to produce
the chimeric transcripts discovered in this study. Tiulpakov et al.
(2005) were unable to determine the chromosomal breakpoints resulting in
the chimeric CYP19 transcripts in this family.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LRP1 is synthesized as a 600-kD precursor transmembrane glycoprotein
that is cleaved in trans-Golgi network by furin (136950) to generate a
515-kD alpha subunit and an 85-kD beta subunit. The alpha and beta
subunits remain noncovalently associated during LRP1 transport to the
cell membrane. LRP1 interacts with a broad range of secreted proteins
and cell surface molecules and mediates their endocytosis and/or
activates signaling pathways through multiple cytosolic adaptor and
scaffold proteins. Phosphorylation of the LRP1 tail regulates ligand
internalization and signal transduction (summary by Deane et al., 2004).

CLONING

Herz et al. (1988) cloned a cDNA for the low density lipoprotein
receptor-related protein (LRP) by virtue of its close homology to the
LDL receptor (606945). The 4,544-amino acid protein contains a single
transmembrane segment. Northern blot analysis detected LRP1 mRNA in
liver, brain, and lung. Kristensen et al. (1990) and Strickland et al.
(1990) demonstrated that LRP is identical to alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M;
103950) receptor (A2MR). Like mannose-6-phosphate receptor (147280), the
A2MR/LRP molecule is probably bifunctional.

In the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, Yochem and Greenwald
(1993) isolated and sequenced a gene more than 23 kb long that encodes a
large integral membrane protein with a predicted structure similar to
that of LRP of mammals. The 4,753-amino acid product predicted for the
C. elegans gene shared a nearly identical number and arrangement of
amino acid sequence motifs with human LRP, and several exons of the C.
elegans LRP gene corresponded to exons of related parts of the human LRP
gene.

Ranganathan et al. (2011) stated that the heavy chain of LRP1 contains 4
clusters of ligand-binding repeats. The light chain includes the
transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain, which contains 2 NPxY
motifs and 2 dileucine repeats that contribute to LRP1 endocytosis.
Ranganathan et al. (2011) also purified a soluble form of LRP1 from
human plasma.

MAPPING

Myklebost et al. (1989) mapped the gene for the LRP-related protein to
12q13-q14 by study of DNA from rodent-human cell hybrids and by in situ
hybridization; the symbol APOER was used initially because of the
putative APOE receptor function.

By pulsed field gel analysis, Forus et al. (1991) found that the APR and
GLI genes are closely situated; probes for either gene hybridized to DNA
fragments of molecular weight 300-400 kb. More detailed restriction
analysis showed that the intergenic region was between 200 and 300 kb
(Forus and Myklebost, 1992). Hilliker et al. (1992) confirmed the
assignment to 12q13-q14 using both nonisotopic and isotopic in situ
hybridization. Also by in situ hybridization, they assigned the
corresponding locus to mouse chromosome 15. Binder et al. (2000) pointed
out that gp96 and CD91 both map to the long arm of chromosome 12.

GENE FUNCTION

Herz et al. (1988) found that LRP showed strong calcium binding.

Kounnas et al. (1995) showed that LRP mediates the endocytosis and
degradation of secreted amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760),
suggesting that a single metabolic pathway links 2 molecules implicated
in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300). Narita et al.
(1997) showed that A2M, via LRP, mediates the clearance and degradation
of APP-generated beta-amyloid (A-beta), the major component of amyloid
plaques in AD.

Kang et al. (2000) demonstrated in vitro that LRP1 is required for the
A2M-mediated clearance of A-beta 40 and 42 via a bona fide
receptor-mediated cellular uptake mechanism. Analysis of postmortem
human brain tissue showed that LRP expression normally declines with
age, and that LRP expression in AD brains was significantly lower than
in controls. Within the AD group, higher LRP levels were correlated with
later age of onset of AD and death. Kang et al. (2000) concluded that
reduced LRP expression is a contributing risk factor for AD, possibly by
impeding the clearance of soluble beta-amyloid.

The heat-shock protein gp96 (TRA1; 191175) is an intracellular protein
capable of chaperoning exogenous antigens from tumors or virus-infected
cells to antigen-presenting cells for presentation through major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I rather than class II molecules,
thereby eliciting CD8 (186910)-positive T-cell responses. Using a mouse
system, Binder et al. (2000) determined that the receptor for gp96 is
CD91 (A2MR) and that A2M, a protein found in blood, inhibits gp96
binding to CD91. They proposed that CD91 acts as a sensor for necrotic
cell death in tissues, leading to proinflammatory immune responses.

Basu et al. (2001) used fluorescence-labeled heat-shock proteins (HSPs)
to show that not only GP96, but also HSP90 (HSPCA; 140571), HSP70 (see
HSPA1A, 140550), and calreticulin (CALR; 109091) use CD91 as a common
receptor. The ability of the cells to bind HSPs correlates with the
proteasome- and TAP (170260)-dependent ability to re-present
HSP-chaperoned peptides.

Forus et al. (1991) found that the APR and GLI (165220) genes are
coamplified in a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line.

Smeijers et al. (2002) showed that murine Lrp1 is a cell surface
receptor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin A.

Wang et al. (2003) demonstrated that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA,
or PLAT; 173370) upregulates MMP9 (120361) in cell culture and in vivo.
MMP9 levels were lower in tPA knockout compared with wildtype mice after
focal cerebral ischemia. In human cerebral microvascular endothelial
cells, MMP9 was upregulated when recombinant tPA was added. RNA
interference suggested that this response was mediated by LRP1, which
avidly binds tPA and possesses signaling properties.

THBS1 (188060) or a peptide of the 19-amino acid active site in its
heparin-binding domain signals focal adhesion disassembly through
interaction with a cell surface form of calreticulin (CRT, or CALR;
109091). Using bovine aortic endothelial cells and wildtype and Lrp -/-
mouse fibroblasts, Orr et al. (2003) showed that Lrp interacted with Crt
and was required to mediate focal adhesion disassembly and downstream
signaling for reorganization of focal adhesions. Binding of the LRP
ligand RAP to purified human LRP inhibited interaction between
recombinant human CRT and LRP.

Deane et al. (2004) found that wildtype A-beta 40 bound immobilized LRP
with higher affinity than A-beta 42 or mutant A-beta 40 due to the lower
beta sheet content of wildtype A-beta 40 compared with the other
molecules. Lrp at mouse brain capillaries mediated clearance of wildtype
A-beta 40 across the blood-brain barrier at a rate much higher than
those for A-beta 42 and mutant A-beta 40. In primary human brain
endothelial capillaries in culture, high concentrations of all A-beta
species reduced LRP content via degradation in proteasomes. Loss of the
LRP-binding protein Rap (LRPAP1; 104225) in Rap -/- mice reduced brain
capillary clearance of all A-beta species. Expression of LRP was reduced
in AD and Dutch-type cerebrovascular beta-amyloidosis (605714) brain
tissue, suggesting that inadequate LRP-mediated A-beta clearance
contributes to the formation of neurotoxic A-beta oligomers and
progressive neuronal dysfunction.

The cysteine-rich extracellular domains (CRDs) of frizzled proteins (see
FZ1, or FZD1; 603408) function as Wnt (see WNT3A; 606359) receptors.
Using transfected HEK293 cells, Zilberberg et al. (2004) showed that
LRP1 or a C-terminal fragment of LRP1 containing the fourth cluster of
ligand-binding repeats, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic
tail bound the CRD of human FZ1 and inhibited FZ1-dependent Wnt
signaling. LRP1 did not mediate FZ1 internalization and degradation, but
sequestered FZ1 and inhibited its formation of a functional Wnt
signaling complex with LRP6 (603507).

Since BACE1 (604252) and APP interact and traffic with one another, and
APP interacts with and traffics with LRP1, von Arnim et al. (2005)
investigated interactions between BACE1 and LRP1. They found that BACE1
interacted with the light chain of LRP1 on the cell surface in
association with lipid rafts. The BACE-LRP1 interaction led to increased
LRP1 extracellular domain cleavage and subsequent release of the LRP1
intracellular domain from the membrane. Von Arnim et al. (2005)
concluded that LRP1 is a BACE1 substrate.

Kinchen et al. (2005) showed that in C. elegans, CED1 (LRP1), CED6 (see
608165), and CED7 (see 601615) are required for actin reorganization
around the apoptotic cell corpse, and that CED1 and CED6 colocalize with
each other and with actin around the dead cell. Furthermore, Kinchen et
al. (2005) found that the CED10 (RAC1; 602048) GTPase acts genetically
downstream of these proteins to mediate corpse removal, functionally
linking the 2 engulfment pathways and identifying the CED1, CED6, and
CED7 signaling module as upstream regulators of Rac activation.

Using knockout mice, Liu et al. (2007) found that expression of Lrp1 was
elevated following deletion of App, its homolog Aplp2 (104776), or
components of the App-processing gamma-secretase complex (see 104311).
Lrp1 expression was also elevated following inhibition of
gamma-secretase activity. Elevated Lrp1 mRNA and protein was accompanied
by increased catabolism of Apoe (107741) and cholesterol. Reporter gene
assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the App
intracellular domain (AICD), which is released along with A-beta by
gamma-secretase activity, bound the Lrp1 promoter together with Fe65
(APBB1; 602709) and Tip60 (KAT5; 601409) and suppressed Lrp1 expression.

Gaultier et al. (2008) found that Schwann cells in injured rodent nerve
exhibited increased expression of Lrp1. A soluble fragment of Lrp1 with
an intact alpha chain (sLrp-alpha) was shed by Schwann cells in vitro
and in the peripheral nervous system after injury. Injection of purified
sLrp-alpha into mouse sciatic nerves prior to chronic constriction
injury inhibited p38 Mapk (MAPK14; 600289) activation and decreased
expression of Tnf-alpha (191160) and Il1-beta (147720) locally.
sLrp-alpha also inhibited injury-induced spontaneous neuropathic pain
and decreased inflammatory cytokine expression in the spinal dorsal
horn, where neuropathic pain processing occurs. In cultured rat Schwann
cells, astrocytes, and microglia, sLrp-alpha inhibited Tnf-alpha-induced
activation of p38 Mapk and Erk/Mapk.

The cell surface receptor CED1 mediates apoptotic cell recognition by
phagocytic cells, enabling cell corpse clearance in C. elegans. Chen et
al. (2010) found that the C. elegans intracellular protein sorting
complex, retromer, was required for cell corpse clearance by mediating
the recycling of CED1. The mammalian retromer complex contains sorting
nexins 1/2 (601272, 605929) (C. elegans homolog snx1) and 5/6 (605937,
606098) (C. elegans homolog snx6). Retromer was recruited to the
surfaces of phagosomes containing cell corpses, and its loss of function
caused defective cell corpse removal. The retromer probably acted
through direct interaction with CED1 in the cell corpse recognition
pathway. In the absence of retromer function, CED1 associated with
lysosomes and failed to recycle from phagosomes and cytosol to the
plasma membrane. Thus, Chen et al. (2010) concluded that retromer is an
essential mediator of apoptotic cell clearance by regulating phagocytic
receptor(s) during cell corpse engulfment.

Ranganathan et al. (2011) noted that previous work (Cao et al., 2006)
had shown colocalization of LRP1 with integrin alpha-M (ITGAM;
120980)/beta-2 (ITGB2; 600065) at the trailing edge of migrating
macrophages and that macrophage migration depended upon coordinated
action of LRP1 and alpha-M/beta-2, as well as tissue plasminogen
activator and its inhibitor, PAI1 (SERPINE1; 173360). Ranganathan et al.
(2011) found that LRP1 specifically bound integrin alpha-M/beta-2, but
not the homologous receptor integrin alpha-L (ITGAL; 153370)/beta-2.
Activation of alpha-M/beta-2 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced
interaction between LRP1 and alpha-M/beta-2 in macrophages. Transfection
experiments in HEK293 cells revealed that both the heavy and light
chains of LRP1 contributed to alpha-M/beta-2 binding. Within the LRP1
heavy chain, binding was mediated primarily via ligand-binding motifs 2
and 4. Within alpha-M, the sequence EQLKKSKTL within the I domain was
the major LRP1 recognition site. Exposure of alpha-M/beta-2-expressing
HEK293 cells to soluble LRP1 inhibited cell attachment to fibrinogen
(see 134820). Mouse macrophages lacking Lrp1 were deficient in
alpha-M/beta-2 internalization upon LPS stimulation. Ranganathan et al.
(2011) concluded that LRP1 has a role in macrophage migration and that
it is critical for internalization of integrin alpha-M/beta-2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Alzheimer disease

The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene was an
attractive candidate for Alzheimer disease (AD) for several reasons. The
multifunctional LRP had been shown to function as a receptor for the
uptake of apolipoprotein E-containing lipoprotein particles by neurons.
The apoE4 (107741) allele is strongly associated with an increased risk
of late-onset familial Alzheimer disease and both late-onset and
early-onset sporadic AD. The LRP receptor is prominently located in the
soma regions and proximal processes of neurons. In a case-control study
of 183 familial and sporadic AD patients and 118 controls, Lendon et al.
(1997) found a moderate association (odds ratio = 1.57, p = 0.024)
between AD and the 87-bp allele of a tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism
located 5-prime to the LRP1 gene. Furthermore, Pericak-Vance et al.
(1997) found in a genomic screen and follow-up analysis of 54 late-onset
AD families, 4 regions potentially harboring AD genes; one of these
regions, on chromosome 12, was located about 10 cM proximal of LRP1.
Scott et al. (1998) examined 144 late-onset multiplex AD families, 436
sporadic AD cases, and 240 controls and found no evidence of linkage or
association of LRP1 and AD. Their data indicated that genetic variation
in the LRP1 gene is not a major risk factor in the etiology of Alzheimer
disease.

Among 157 patients with late-onset AD (85 with a family history and 72
without a family history), Kang et al. (1997) found increased frequency
of the C allele of a 766C-T polymorphism in exon 3 of the LRP1 gene
compared to controls, although the C allele was common in controls. The
authors suggested that the polymorphism, predicted to be silent, may be
in linkage disequilibrium with a putative nearby AD susceptibility
locus. Studies by Hollenbach et al. (1998) and Baum et al. (1998) also
provided evidence of increased frequency of the 766C allele in patients
with AD. McIlroy et al. (2001) found no association with the exon 3
polymorphism and development of AD.

Kang et al. (2000) noted that LRP and its ligands, APOE and
alpha-2-macroglobulin, are all genetically associated with AD.

Bian et al. (2005) investigated the potential genetic contribution of 4
polymorphisms in LRP1 to AD in the Han Chinese population by studying
216 late-onset AD patients and 200 control subjects. The LRP1 CTCG
haplotype (exon 3 T/C; intron 6 T/C, dbSNP rs2306692; exon 22 T/C;
intron 83 A/G, dbSNP rs1800164) was overrepresented in the control group
(p = 0.002). This difference was still statistically significant in the
APOE4-negative subjects (p = 0.003), indicating that the CTCG haplotype
of LRP1 may reduce the risk for late-onset AD.

ANIMAL MODEL

Boucher et al. (2003) developed tissue-specific knockout mice that
lacked Lrp1 only in vascular smooth muscle cells. To increase
susceptibility to spontaneous atherosclerotic lesion development, these
animals were crossed to LDL receptor (Ldlr; 606945) knockout mice to
generate Ldlr-/smooth muscle Lrp- mice. The presence or absence of Lrp1
expression in smooth muscle cells had no effect on plasma cholesterol or
triglyceride levels in mice on normal chow or an atherogenic
high-cholesterol diet. However, aortas from smooth muscle Lrp- mice were
consistently distended and dilated. This difference increased over time
and was accompanied by thickening of the aortic wall, pronounced
atherosclerosis, and aneurysm formation. Boucher et al. (2003) showed
that Lrp1 forms a complex with the PDGF receptor (see PDGFR1, 173410).
Inactivation of Lrp1 in vascular smooth muscle cells of mice caused
PDGFR overexpression and abnormal activation of PDGFR signaling,
resulting in disruption of the elastic layer, smooth muscle cell
proliferation, aneurysm formation, and marked susceptibility to
cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis. The development of these
abnormalities was reduced by treatment with Gleevec, an inhibitor of
PDGF signaling. Thus, Boucher et al. (2003) concluded that LRP1 has a
pivotal role in protecting vascular wall integrity and preventing
atherosclerosis by controlling PDGFR activation.

May et al. (2004) found that mice with targeted disruption of the Lrp1
gene in differentiated postmitotic neurons demonstrated hyperactivity
and constant tremor, and later developed dystonic posturing with
increased thoracic kyphosis, waddling gait, and hindlimb weakness,
suggesting motoneuronal disinhibition or motor excitation. The
transgenic mice died prematurely at about 9 months of age. Brain
morphology was normal with no major neuronal loss, suggesting a
functional abnormality in neurotransmission. In vitro, LRP1
coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with the postsynaptic protein PSD95
(602887) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR2A
(138253) and NR2B (138252). Treatment of neurons with NMDA reduced the
interaction of Lrp1 and Psd95. May et al. (2004) concluded that LRP1
plays a role in behavior and motor function by regulating postsynaptic
signaling mechanisms through interaction with NMDA receptors.

Hofmann et al. (2007) generated mice with adipocyte-specific
inactivation of LRP1 and observed delayed postprandial lipid clearance,
reduced body weight, smaller fat stores, lipid-depleted brown
adipocytes, improved glucose tolerance, and elevated energy expenditure
due to enhanced muscle thermogenesis. In addition, the mutant mice were
resistant to dietary fat-induced obesity and glucose intolerance.
Hofmann et al. (2007) concluded that LRP1 is a critical regulator of
adipocyte energy homeostasis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
LRP1, HIS3258GLN

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to intellectual disability has not been confirmed.

In a boy who developed seizures and developmental stagnation at age 22
months and ultimately had severe intellectual disability with an IQ of
34, stereotypic behavior, high pain threshold, and sleep disturbances
with a normal brain MRI and no dysmorphic features, de Ligt et al.
(2012) identified a de novo heterozygous 9774C-G transversion resulting
in a his3258-to-gln (H3258Q) substitution.

603894	TITLE *603894 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 6; RGS6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) family, such as
RGS6, modulate G protein function by activating the intrinsic GTPase
activity of the alpha (guanine nucleotide-binding) subunits (Seki et
al., 1999).

CLONING

By EST database analysis and PCR of a brain cDNA library, Posner et al.
(1999) obtained a full-length cDNA encoding RGS6. The predicted
472-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 54.4 kD. It
contains an N-terminal dishevelled (see 601365)/egl10/pleckstrin
(173570) (DEP) domain, a central G protein gamma subunit (see GNG2;
606981)-like (GGL) domain, and an RGS domain near the C terminus.

Using RT-PCR, Seki et al. (1999) showed that RGS6 was expressed in
various tissues.

By PCR of a brain cDNA library, Chatterjee et al. (2003) identified 36
RGS6 splice variants resulting from the use of 2 alternative
transcription sites and complex alternative splicing. The variants
encode proteins with long or short N-terminal domains, complete or
incomplete GGL domains, 7 distinct C-terminal domains, and a common
internal domain that includes the RGS domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Posner et al. (1999) expressed RGS6 in insect cells and found that it
formed a cytosolic heterodimer via its GGL domain with the G protein
beta-5 (GNB5; 604447) subunit, but not with other G protein beta
subunits tested. The RGS6/GNB5 complex acted as a GTPase-activating
protein, but it did not form heterotrimeric complexes with G-alpha-o
(GNAO1; 139311)-GDP or G-alpha-q (GNAQ; 600998)-GDP, it did not alter
activity of adenyl cyclase types I, II, or V, and it did not activate
phospholipase C-beta-1 (PLCB1; 607120) or PLCB2 (604114). However, the
RGS6/GNB5 complex inhibited GNB1/GNG2-mediated activation of PLCB2.

Chatterjee et al. (2003) found that RGS6 isoforms with complete GGL
domains interacted with GNB5, irrespective of their N-terminal domain,
following expression in COS-7 cells. In contrast, RGS6 isoforms lacking
a complete GGL domain did not interact with GNB5. Subcellular
distribution patterns for RGS6 isoforms ranged from exclusively
cytoplasmic to exclusively nuclear/nucleolar, and coexpression of GNB5
promoted nuclear localization of RGS6 isoforms.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sierra et al. (2002) determined that the RGS6 gene contains 17 exons.
Chatterjee et al. (2003) determined that the RGS6 gene contains 20 exons
and spans 630 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell and radiation hybrid analysis, Seki et al. (1999) mapped
the RGS6 gene to chromosome 14q24.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In an epidemiologic study of 477 bladder cancer patients and 446 matched
controls, Berman et al. (2004) identified 3 noncoding SNPs in RGS2
(600861) and RGS6 that were each associated with a significantly reduced
risk of bladder cancer. When analyzed separately, a C-to-T SNP in the
3-prime UTR of RGS6, dbSNP rs2074647, conferred the greatest overall
reduction in bladder cancer risk, with a significant odds ratio of 0.66.
The reduction of risk was more pronounced in those who had ever smoked.
Expression of dbSNP rs2074647 increased the activity of a luciferase-RGS
fusion protein nearly 3-fold. PCR analysis confirmed that RGS6 splice
variants were expressed in bladder cancer tissue and cell lines. Berman
et al. (2004) proposed that RGS proteins may be important modulators of
cancer risk.

610844	TITLE *610844 SPG11 GENE; SPG11
;;SPATACSIN;;
KIAA1840;;
FLJ21439
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned KIAA1840. The deduced protein
contains 1,437 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in
all tissues and specific brain regions examined, with highest expression
in liver, followed by brain and ovary.

Stevanin et al. (2007) demonstrated that the full-length 8-kb SPG11
transcript encodes a predicted protein of 2,443 amino acids, which they
termed spatacsin, after 'spasticity with thin or atrophied corpus
callosum syndrome protein.' Human SPG11 shares 85% identity with the
homologous protein in dog, 76% with mouse, and 73% with rat. The
spatacsin protein includes 4 putative transmembrane domains, suggesting
that the protein may be a receptor or transporter, as well as a leucine
zipper and coiled-coil domain. It was assigned to the aromatic compound
dioxygenase superfamily because of 22% identity with the consensus
sequence between residues 2104 and 2381. The SPG11 gene is expressed
ubiquitously in the nervous system but most prominently in the
cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and pineal gland.
Overexpression of a GFP fusion protein in COS-7 cells demonstrated a
diffuse and reticular cytosolic and perinuclear distribution, sometimes
also present in nuclei. At least 3 alternative transcripts were detected
in all structures of adult brain. mRNA in situ hybridization in rat
brain detected no expression in newborn rat, but found expression
throughout the brain in adult rat.

GENE STRUCTURE

Stevanin et al. (2007) determined that the SPG11 gene comprises 40 exons
and spans 101 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
KIAA1840 gene to chromosome 15 (TMAP SGC33828). Stevanin et al. (2007)
mapped the SPG11 gene to chromosome 15q21.1 by genomic sequence
analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of HeLa cells, Slabicki et al. (2010)
showed that KIAA0415 (613653) exists in a core protein complex
containing SPG11, SPG15 (270700), C20ORF29 (AP5S1; 614824), and
DKFZp761E198 (614367). Knockdown of KIAA0415, C20ORF29, or SPG15 in HeLa
cells reduced homologous recombination in a test substrate, whereas
knockdown of SPG11 or DKFZp761E198 had no effect.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 11 families with autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia
with thin corpus callosum (SPG11; 604360), Stevanin et al. (2007) found
10 different mutations in the spatacsin gene. The mutations were either
nonsense or insertions or deletions leading to a frameshift, suggesting
a loss-of-function mechanism.

Del Bo et al. (2007) identified a homozygous mutation in the SPG11 gene
(733delAT; 610844.0004) in 27-year-old Italian opposite-sex dizygotic
twins with autosomal recessive SPG11.

In 9 unrelated families with SPG11, Hehr et al. (2007) identified 11
different mutations, including 10 novel mutations, in the SPG11 gene
(see, e.g., 610844.0005-610844.0006) in the homozygous or compound
heterozygous state. Four of the families were consanguineous, including
3 Turkish families initially reported by Olmez et al. (2006). Mutations
were distributed throughout the entire spatacsin gene without obvious
clustering.

Bauer et al. (2009) used high-resolution comparative genomic
hybridization (HRCGH) to identify deletions in the SPG11 gene in 3
patients with SPG11 in whom only 1 mutant SPG11 allele had been
identified by gene sequencing. HRCGH analysis suggested heterozygous
genomic deletion in all 3 patients; however, quantitative PCR confirmed
an 8.23-kb deletion in only 1 patient. The 8.23-kb deletion resulted in
loss of exons 31 to 34 and was also found in the proband's affected
sister and their unaffected father. The clinical features in the brother
and sister did not differ from those of patients with point mutations.

In 3 consanguineous North African kindreds, Stevanin et al. (2007) found
that a homozygous 6100C-T transition in exon 32 of the SPG11 gene,
resulting in an arg2034-to-stop substitution (R2034X), segregated with
spastic paraplegia with thin corpus callosum (604360). If not rapidly
degraded, the predicted protein would be truncated by 27% of its normal
size.

In 27-year-old Italian opposite-sex dizygotic twins with autosomal
recessive SPG11 (604360), Del Bo et al. (2007) identified a homozygous
2-bp deletion (733delAT) in exon 4 of the SPG11 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination at codon 247. The sibs had onset of
ataxia and cognitive impairment at ages 12 and 15 years, respectively.
The disorder progressed rapidly, leading to spastic paraplegia,
dysarthria, and peripheral neuropathy. Both were wheelchair-bound in
their early twenties. Brain MRI showed thin corpus callosum and cortical
atrophy in both sibs. Both parents were healthy and came from the same
small town in Sicily but denied consanguinity.

In a Spanish patient with SPG11, Hehr et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for the 733delAT mutation and 1-bp insertion (2472insT;
610844.0005) of exon 14 of the SPG11 gene, resulting in frameshift and

transversion in intron 39 (7152-1G-C) of the SPG11 gene, resulting in
loss of the splice acceptor site and predicting a loss of function. An
unrelated 41-year-old Swedish patient with SPG11 had the splice site
mutation in compound heterozygosity with a 5623C-T transition in exon 30
of the SPG11 gene, resulting in a gln1875-to-ter (Q1875X; 610844.0008)
substitution. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect for
7152-1G-C mutation, which was found in 2 (1.8%) of 216 Swedish control
chromosomes. Both patients were wheelchair-bound due to lower limb
spasticity, had amyotrophy of the hands, sphincter disturbances, thin

611569	TITLE *611569 CYTOSKELETON-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; CKAP2
;;TUMOR- AND MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; TMAP;;
LB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CKAP2 is a cytoskeleton-associated protein involved in mitotic
progression (Seki and Fang, 2007).

CLONING

By differential screening of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, followed by
database analysis, RT-PCR, and screening a human Jurkat T-cell cDNA
library, Maouche-Chretien et al. (1998) cloned CKAP2, which they called
LB1. The transcript contains 2 consensus polyadenylation signals and an
AU-rich mRNA-destabilizing motif. The deduced 683-amino acid protein has
a leucine- and isoleucine-rich domain and numerous potential
phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected variable
expression of a major 3.6- to 3.9-kb transcript and a minor 2.2-kb
transcript in all human tissues and cell lines examined. In vitro
transcription/translation produced a protein with an apparent molecular
mass of 85 kD by SDS-PAGE. Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected
COS cells showed that epitope-tagged CKAP2 localized to cytoplasmic
cytoskeletal filaments.

By differential display-PCR of primary human gastric adenocarcinomas,
followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bae et al. (2003) cloned
full-length CKAP2 and a shorter variant, CKAP2S, resulting from
alternative splicing in exon 6. The full-length CKAP2 protein contains
682 amino acids, and the CKAP2S protein contains 494 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis showed that CKAP2 expression was higher in brain,
thymus, kidney, and placenta than in heart, skeletal muscle, lung,
leukocytes, and gastrointestinal tract. A second, smaller transcript was
detected in tissues with high CKAP2 expression. Endogenous CKAP2 and
fluorescence-tagged CKAP2 associated with the microtubule-organizing
center and with microtubules in HeLa cells, and this localization was
lost following treatment with a microtubule-destabilizing agent. Western
blot analysis detected endogenous CKAP2 at an apparent molecular mass of
75 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Maouche-Chretien et al. (1998) found that expression of LB1 was
upregulated in a patient with an immunoblastic subtype of diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma and in a patient with a multilobated centroblastic
subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In contrast, expression was
low or undetectable in 4 patients with polymorphic centroblastic diffuse
large B-cell lymphomas.

Using ribonuclease protection assays and RT-PCR, Bae et al. (2003) found
that CKAP2 and CKAP2S expression was upregulated in gastric tumor
tissues compared with matched normal mucosa. Immunohistochemical
analysis detected no CKAP2 protein in normal gastric mucosa, but it was
detected in all gastric adenocarcinomas and tubular adenomas examined.

Jeon et al. (2006) found that CKAP2 was not expressed in G0/G1-arrested
human foreskin fibroblasts, but that it was expressed in actively
dividing cells, gradually increasing between late G1 and G2/M. Knockdown
of CKAP2 reduced RB1 (614041) phosphorylation and increased p27 (CDKN1B;
600778) expression, and consequently reduced cell proliferation, whereas
constitutive CKAP2 expression increased RB phosphorylation and enhanced
proliferation.

The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C; see 608473) is a
ubiquitin ligase that controls sister chromatid separation and exit from
mitosis. It recognizes 2 motifs in its substrates: the destruction (D)
box and the KEN box. Seki and Fang (2007) found that CKAP2 was degraded
by CDH1 (192090)-activated APC/C in Xenopus interphase extracts, but not
in mitotic extracts. CKAP2 contains 4 D boxes and a KEN box, and
mutation analysis showed that only the KEN box was required for
ubiquitination by APC/C-CDH1 and degradation in CDH1-activated
interphase extracts. Overexpression of CDH1 in HeLa cells reduced CKAP2
levels in a KEN box-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of CDH1
increased the half-life of CKAP2. CKAP2 associated with centrosomal
microtubules in late G2 in HeLa cells, but only after separation of
duplicated centrosomes. During mitosis, CKAP2 associated with spindle
poles and with spindle microtubules from prophase through anaphase and
disappeared from microtubules during cytokinesis. Knockdown of CKAP2 did
not alter the cell cycle distribution of cells or generate mitotic
effects. On the other hand, ectopic expression of either wildtype CKAP2
or a nondegradable CKAP2 mutant led to mitotic arrest with monopolar
spindles containing highly bundled microtubules. Seki and Fang (2007)
concluded that regulation of CKAP2 by APC/C is critical for normal
mitotic progression.

MAPPING

By FISH, Maouche-Chretien et al. (1998) mapped the CKAP2 gene to
chromosome 13q14.

605434	TITLE *605434 CLASPIN, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF; CLSPN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kumagai and Dunphy (2000) identified a Xenopus protein, which they
designated claspin, that binds to Xenopus Chk1 (CHEK1; 603078). By
searching an EST database for sequences related to Xenopus claspin, they
identified the human homolog. The full-length cDNA sequence of human
claspin encodes a predicted 1,332-amino acid polypeptide that is 49%
identical to Xenopus claspin.

GENE FUNCTION

Kumagai and Dunphy (2000) found that binding of claspin to Xenopus Chk1
was highly elevated in the presence of DNA templates that triggered a
checkpoint arrest of the cell cycle in Xenopus egg extracts. Xenopus
Chk1 became phosphorylated during a checkpoint response, and this
phosphorylation resulted in the activation of Xenopus Chk1.
Immunodepletion of claspin from egg extracts abolished both the
phosphorylation and activation of Xenopus Chk1. Furthermore,
claspin-depleted extracts were unable to arrest the cell cycle in
response to DNA replication blocks. These findings indicated that
claspin is an essential upstream regulator of Chk1 in Xenopus.

Lee et al. (2003) showed that Xenopus claspin associates with chromatin
in a regulated manner during S phase. Binding of claspin to chromatin
depended on the prereplication complex and Cdc45 (603465), but not on
replication protein A (RPA; 179835). These dependencies suggested that
binding of claspin occurs around the time of initial DNA unwinding at
replication origins. By contrast, both Atr (601215) and Rad17 (603139)
required Rpa for association with DNA. Claspin, Atr, and Rad17 all bound
to chromatin independently. These findings suggested that claspin plays
a role in monitoring DNA replication during S phase.

Chini and Chen (2003) observed that human claspin is a cell
cycle-regulated protein that peaks at S/G2 phase. Claspin localized in
nuclei and associated with CHK1 following replication stress or other
types of DNA damage. Claspin was phosphorylated in response to
replication stress, and phosphorylation appeared to be required for the
association between claspin and CHK1. In addition, claspin interacted
with the checkpoint proteins ATR and RAD9 (603761). Since ATR and the
RAD9-RAD1 (603153)-HUS1 (603760) complex are involved in CHK1
activation, the authors hypothesized that claspin may be an adaptor that
brings these molecules together. Downregulation of claspin by small
interfering RNA inhibited CHK1 activation in response to replication
stress, augmented the premature chromatin condensation induced by
hydroxyurea, inhibited ultraviolet-induced reduction of DNA synthesis,
and decreased cell survival.

Yoo et al. (2004) showed that, during checkpoint response, Xenopus
claspin becomes phosphorylated on thr906, creating a docking site for
Plx1, the Xenopus homolog of PLK1 (602098). This interaction promotes
phosphorylation of claspin on ser934 by Plx1. Yoo et al. (2004) stated
that, after a prolonged interphase arrest, aphidicolin-treated egg
extracts typically undergo adaptation and enter into mitosis despite the
presence of incompletely replicated DNA. In this process, claspin
dissociates from chromatin, and Chk1 undergoes inactivation. By
contrast, aphidicolin-treated extracts containing mutants of claspin
with thr906-to-ala or ser934-to-ala substitutions were unable to undergo
adaptation. Under such adaptation-defective conditions, claspin
accumulated on chromatin at high levels, and Chk1 did not decrease in
activity. These results indicated that the Plx1-dependent inactivation
of claspin results in termination of a DNA replication checkpoint
response.

Wang et al. (2006) found that phosphorylated RAD17 interacted with
claspin and regulated its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of RAD17 was
differentially required in response to different DNA-damaging agents and
was particularly important in stress due to hydroxyurea exposure.

Mailand et al. (2006) and Peschiaroli et al. (2006) found that claspin
became degraded at the onset of mitosis. Claspin degradation was
triggered by its interaction with and ubiquitylation by BTRC (603482).
The BTRC-claspin interaction was phosphorylation dependent and required
PLK1 activity and integrity of the BTRC degradation motif in the N
terminus of claspin. Mailand et al. (2006) found that uncoupling claspin
from BTRC by mutating the conserved serines in the degradation motif or
by BTRC knockdown stabilized claspin in mitosis, impaired CHK1
dephosphorylation, and delayed G2/M transition during recovery from cell
cycle arrest imposed by DNA damage or replication stress. The inability
to degrade claspin allowed partial reactivation of CHK1 in cells exposed
to DNA damage after passing the G2/M transition. Peschiaroli et al.
(2006) found that expression of a stable claspin mutant unable to bind
BTRC prolonged activation of CHK1, thereby attenuating recovery from the
DNA replication stress response and significantly delaying entry into
mitosis.

MAPPING

Kumagai and Dunphy (2000) mapped the human claspin gene to 1p34.3-p34.1
based on sequence similarity between the claspin sequence (GenBank
GENBANK AF297866) and the chromosome 1 clone RP4-555P23 (GenBank GENBANK
AL139143).

613336	TITLE *613336 MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED RING-CH FINGER PROTEIN 9; MARCH9
;;MARCH IX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MARCH9 is a member of the MARCH family of membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin
ligases (EC 6.3.2.19). MARCH enzymes add ubiquitin (see 191339) to
target lysines in substrate proteins, thereby signaling their vesicular
transport between membrane compartments. MARCH9 induces internalization
of several membrane glycoproteins and directs them to the endosomal
compartment (Bartee et al., 2004; Hoer et al., 2007).

CLONING

Poxviruses and gamma-2 herpesviruses express ubiquitin ligases called K3
proteins that inhibit the surface expression of glycoproteins, including
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (see 142800).
By searching a database for sequences similar to the functional domains
of viral K3 proteins, Bartee et al. (2004) identified 9 human MARCH
proteins, including MARCH9. The deduced full-length MARCH9 protein
contains a short N terminus, followed by a RING-CH domain and 2
transmembrane domains. It shares 90% identity with MARCH4 (608208) in
the RING-CH and transmembrane domains. Bartee et al. (2004) also
identified a MARCH9 variant that encodes a protein lacking the RING-CH
domain. Real-time PCR analysis showed that both MARCH9 variants were
expressed in all human tissues examined at variable levels.

Hoer et al. (2007) determined that the short MARCH9 variant, which they
called MARCH9 RINGless, uses a transcription initiation site within
intron 2 of the MARCH9 gene. The deduced protein contains the same 2
C-terminal transmembrane domains as full-length MARCH9, but it has a
unique 57-amino acid N terminus that replaces the RING-CH domain.
Epitope-tagged full-length MARCH9 colocalized with a lysosomal marker.
When overexpressed, it also colocalized with the trans-Golgi network
(TGN).

Using RT-PCR, De Gassart et al. (2008) detected robust MARCH9 expression
in all human cells and cell lines examined, including immature and
mature dendritic cells, HeLa and B-cell lines, and monocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an in vitro ubiquitination assay, Bartee et al. (2004) found that
the isolated RING-CH domain of MARCH9 could not function as an E3
ubiquitin ligase with any E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes tested,
including UBCH2 (UBE2H; 601082), UBCH3 (CDC34; 116948), UBCH5A (UBE2D1;
602961), UBCH6 (UBE2E1; 602916), and UBCH7 (UBE2L3; 603721). Following
transfection into HeLa cells, full-length MARCH9 downregulated the
surface expression of cotransfected CD4 (186940) and endogenous MHC I.
Mutation analysis showed that the RING-CH domain of MARCH9 was essential
for MHC I downregulation, and the MARCH9 isoform lacking the RING-CH
domain did not downregulate MHC I surface expression. MHC I was
internalized to lysosomes via multivesicular bodies, and inhibition of
endosome acidification or expression of a dominant-negative VPS4 (see
609982) mutant abrogated MARCH9-induced MHC I internalization. Deletion
of lysines in the tails of HLA-A2.1 (600642) and CD4 made these proteins
resistant to MARCH9-induced degradation, suggesting that ubiquitination
of these lysines is required for their uptake and degradation.

Hoer et al. (2007) found that overexpression of full-length MARCH9
downregulated the surface expression of ICAM1 (147840), a critical cell
adhesion molecule, and MHC I in transfected HeLa and 293T cells.
Downregulation of ICAM1 involved monoubiquitination of ICAM1 on a
cytoplasmic lysine. Mutation analysis revealed that a critical aspartate
within the transmembrane region of MARCH9 was required for recognition
of MHC I molecules, but not ICAM1. The MARCH9 RINGless isoform
stabilized full-length MARCH9 via heterodimerization, resulting in
enhanced MARCH9-mediated MHC I and ICAM1 downregulation. Full-length
MARCH9 was also able to homodimerize.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hoer et al. (2007) determined that the MARCH9 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the MARCH9 gene to chromosome 12q14.1 based on an
alignment of the MARCH9 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC009489) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

606116	TITLE *606116 RIBONUCLEASE P/MRP, 38-KD SUBUNIT; RPP38
;;RIBONUCLEASE P, 38-KD SUBUNIT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribonuclease P (RNase P) removes the 5-prime leader sequences from
precursor tRNA molecules. RNase P consists of an RNA species (H1 RNA),
the POP1 protein (602486), and at least 7 proteins called RPPs. The RPPs
have apparent molecular masses of 14 kD (RPP14; 606112), 20 kD (RPP20;
606113), 25 kD (RPP25), 29 kD (RPP29; 606114), 30 kD (RPP30; 606115), 38
kD (RPP38), and 40 kD (RPP40; 606117). Patients with scleroderma
(181750) have serum reactive with RNase P, the Th antigen, which is also
referred to as the To antigen, and RPP30 and RPP38 (summary by Jarrous
et al., 1998, 1999).

CLONING

By biochemical purification of RNase P, micropeptide sequence analysis,
PCR on a fetal liver cDNA library, and EST database searching, Eder et
al. (1997) obtained a cDNA encoding RPP38. The deduced 283-amino acid
protein has a leucine zipper RNA-binding motif and a predicted molecular
mass of nearly 32 kD, less than the 38 kD observed in SDS-PAGE analysis.

Jarrous et al. (1998) determined that RPP38 is a major target for
antisera from systemic sclerosis patients and that the antigen is likely
to be localized in both the nucleoplasm and nucleolus.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that polyclonal antibodies raised
against RPP20, RPP30, RPP38, or RPP40 interact with RNase P from HeLa
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Following depletion of RNase P from HeLa cell extracts, Reiner et al.
(2006) found a severe deficiency in RNA polymerase (Pol) III (see
606007)-mediated transcription of tRNA and other small noncoding RNA
genes. Targeted cleavage of the H1RNA (RPPH1; 608513) moiety of RNase P
altered enzyme specificity and diminished Pol III transcription.
Similarly, inactivation of RNase P protein subunits, such as RPP38, by
small interfering RNA inhibited Pol III function and Pol III-directed
promoter activity in the cell. RNase P exerted its role in transcription
through association with Pol III and chromatin of active tRNA and 5S
rRNA (180420) genes. Reiner et al. (2006) concluded that RNase P has a
role in Pol III transcription and that transcription and early tRNA
processing may be coordinated.

MAPPING

Gross (2013) mapped the RPP38 gene to chromosome 10p13 based on an
alignment of the RPP38 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC029494) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602023	TITLE *602023 CHLORIDE CHANNEL, KIDNEY, B; CLCNKB
;;CLCKB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CLCNKA and CLCNKB channels are members of the ClC family, which
comprises at least 9 mammalian chloride channels. Each is believed to
have 12 transmembrane domains and intracellular N and C termini. The
prototype of the family in Torpedo is gated by both voltage and chloride
(Jentsch and Gunther, 1997).

CLONING

Kieferle et al. (1994) cloned rat and human homologs of 2 closely
related chloride channels found specifically in mammalian kidney, which
they called ClCK1 and ClCK2. In the rat, ClCK1 and ClCK2 appear to be
expressed along the nephron from the thin ascending limb of the Henle
loop onwards. The human homologs of these 2 genes, CLCNKA (602024) and
CLCNKB, encode proteins of 687 amino acids (Saito-Ohara et al., 1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Simon et al. (1997) demonstrated that the intron-exon organization of
the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes was identical, with each channel encoded by
19 exons. Overall, the genes show 94% DNA sequence identity in exons.
The 2 genes are transcribed from the same DNA strand, with CLCNKA
5-prime of CLCNKB. The 2 genes are separated by 11 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Saito-Ohara et al. (1996) mapped the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes to
chromosome 1p36.

Considering CLCNKA and CLCNKB as candidate genes in families with
Bartter syndrome (607364), Simon et al. (1997) isolated PAC and cosmid
genomic clones encoding these genes. They found that both genes were
present in all 6 PAC clones, indicating that they are closely linked to
one another, as previously suggested by in situ hybridization using CLCK
cDNA (Saito-Ohara et al., 1996). Using a marker polymorphism in exon 13
of the CLCNKA gene, Simon et al. (1997) showed that in CEPH kindreds the
gene is linked to chromosome 1; a multipoint lod score of 15.8 at a
recombination fraction of 0.0 was obtained with D1S436.

GENE FUNCTION

Estevez et al. (2001) demonstrated that barttin (BSND; 606412) acts as
an essential beta subunit for CLCNKA and CLCNKB chloride channels, with
which it colocalizes in basolateral membranes of renal tubules and of
potassium-secreting epithelia of the inner ear. Disease-causing
mutations in either CLCNKB or barttin compromise currents through
heteromeric channels. Currents can be stimulated further by mutating a
proline-tyrosine (PY) motif on barttin. Estevez et al. (2001) concluded
that their work described the first known beta subunit for CLC chloride
channels and revealed that heteromers formed by chloride channels and
barttin are crucial for renal salt reabsorption and potassium recycling
in the inner ear.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Bartter Syndrome Type 3

In affected members of 10 kindreds with Bartter syndrome type 3
(607364), Simon et al. (1997) found homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB
gene. Two kindreds showed homozygous loss of part of CLCNKB. The tight
linkage and topology of CLCNKA and CLCNKB raised the question of unequal
crossing over between these genes or blocks of homologous flanking
sequences as a mechanism for deletion of CLCNKB sequences. Simon et al.
(1997) found reciprocal loss of CLCNKA and CLCNKB sequences consistent
with this mechanism. They also demonstrated 7 mutations altering the
CLCNKB gene and cosegregating with the disease (e.g., 602023.0001). In 4
kindreds, affected persons were homozygous for identified mutations, 2
index cases were compound heterozygotes, and a single mutation was
identified in 1 kindred.

Jeck et al. (2000) described 3 unrelated patients presenting with the
typical laboratory findings of Gitelman syndrome (263800). Mutation
analysis in these 3 patients revealed no abnormality in the SLC12A3
(600968) gene. Instead, all patients were found to carry previously
described mutations in the CLCNKB gene: 2 were homozygous for complete
deletion of the gene (602023.0006) and 1 was homozygous for an A-G
substitution at the splice acceptor site of intron 7 (602023.0007)
(Konrad et al., 2000). Further clinical investigation revealed features
more typical of Bartter syndrome than of Gitelman syndrome. Jeck et al.
(2000) suggested that the phenotypic overlap may indicate a physiologic
cooperation of the apical thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter
(SLC12A3) and the basolateral chloride channel (CLCNKB) for salt
reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule.

Schurman et al. (2001) studied 5 African American children with Bartter
syndrome. Like the African American children reported by Simon et al.
(1997), these children demonstrated homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB
gene (602023.0006). They had partial correction of hypokalemia, normal
calciotropic activity, suboptimal growth despite therapy, and abnormal
renal ultrasounds but no nephrocalcinosis.

Fukuyama et al. (2004) reported 2 Japanese patients who suffered from
clinically diagnosed classic Bartter syndrome but who had hypocalciuria.
Hypocalciuria is believed to be a pathognomic finding of Na-Cl
cotransporter malfunction. They identified mutations in the CLCNKB gene,
including a premature termination mutation (602023.0009) and a splice
site mutation (602023.0010). The authors concluded that some CLCNKB
mutations may affect calcium handling in renal tubular cells.

- Bartter Syndrome Type 4B

In a child with renal salt wasting and deafness (Bartter syndrome type
4B; 613090) who had no mutation in the BSND gene (606412), Schlingmann
et al. (2004) identified both a homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB gene
(602023.0008) and a homozygous trp80-to-cys mutation in the CLCNKA gene
(W80C; 602024.0001). Because this combined impairment of the CLCNKA and
CLCNKB genes resulted in a phenotype mimicking the form of infantile
Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness caused by mutation in the
BSND gene (Bartter syndrome type 4A; 602522), Schlingmann et al. (2004)
concluded that this case with digenic inheritance supported the notion
that the CLCNK-type channels are regulated by barttin and offered strong
evidence of genetic heterogeneity in patients who have both severe renal
salt wasting and deafness.

Nozu et al. (2008) reported a 2-year-old Japanese girl with a severe
form of Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness who was born of
nonconsanguineous parents. Genetic analysis showed 2 heterozygous
mutations in the CLCNKA (602024.0002) and CLCNKB (602023.0011) genes on
the paternal allele, and a 12-kb deletion involving portions of the
CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes on the maternal allele. Neither parent was
clinically affected. The findings indicated clear digenic inheritance in
this patient and confirmed that loss of function of all 4 alleles of the
CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes can result in Bartter syndrome type 4B.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, PRO124LEU

In 2 apparently unrelated Turkish kindreds, Simon et al. (1997) found
that children with Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) were homozygous for
the identical mutation, a substitution of leucine for proline at codon
124 of the CLCNKB gene. This proline residue is conserved among all
mammalian members of the CLC family.

.0002
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, ALA204THR

In 2 Spanish kindreds, Simon et al. (1997) found that individuals with
Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) were homozygous for substitution of
threonine for alanine at codon 204 in the fifth transmembrane domain of
the CLCNKB gene. All CLC channel members, including the CLC-related
channel of yeast, have alanine or glycine at this position, within a
highly conserved hydrophobic segment (amino acids AAAA or AGAA).

.0003
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, ARG438CYS

One of the missense mutations in the CLCNKB gene identified by Simon et
al. (1997) in Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) patients was arg438 to
cys (R438C), where R438 is conserved among all members of the CLC
family.

.0004
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, ALA349ASP

One of the missense mutations identified by Simon et al. (1997) in the
CLCNKB gene in patients with Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) was ala349
to asp (A349D), which introduces a charged residue in the predicted
eighth transmembrane domain of the channel.

.0005
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, TYR432HIS

One of the mutations identified by Simon et al. (1997) in the CLCNKB
gene in Bartter syndrome type 3 (607364) patients was a tyr432-to-his
(Y432H) substitution.

.0006
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3
CLCNKB, DEL

In 3 patients, the offspring of consanguineous parents, presenting with
biochemical findings consistent with the diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome
(263800), Jeck et al. (2000) detected 2 mutations previously described
by Konrad et al. (2000): homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB gene was
present in 2 patients, and homozygous exchange of guanine for adenine at
the consensus acceptor site of intron 7 (602023.0007) was present in the
third. Review of medical history revealed early onset of the disease,
within the first year of life. Clinical presentation included episodes
of dehydration, weakness, and failure to thrive, much more suggestive of
classic Bartter syndrome (607364) than of Gitelman syndrome. The
coexistence of hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria was not present from the
beginning. In the follow-up, a drop of both parameters below normal
range was a consistent finding reflecting a transition from classic
Bartter syndrome to Gitelman syndrome phenotype. Jeck et al. (2000)
suggested that the phenotypic overlap may indicate a physiologic
cooperation of the apical thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter and the
basolateral chloride channel for salt reabsorption in the distal
convoluted tubule.

.0007

CLCNKB, IVS7, A-G, -2

See 602023.0006 and Jeck et al. (2000).

.0008
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 4B
CLCNKB, DEL

In a child with renal salt wasting and deafness (Bartter syndrome type
4B; 613090) who had no mutation in the BSND gene (606412), Schlingmann
et al. (2004) identified both a homozygous deletion of the CLCNKB gene
and a homozygous cys80-to-trp (C80W) mutation in the CLCNKA gene (C80W;
602024.0001). The patient was born prematurely to consanguineous
parents, and the pregnancy was complicated by severe maternal
polyhydramnios during the last 6 weeks of gestation.

.0009
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3, WITH HYPOCALCIURIA
CLCNKB, TRP610TER

In 2 Japanese patients who had been diagnosed with classic Bartter
syndrome (607364) but who presented with hypocalciuria, Fukuyama et al.
(2004) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1830 in exon 16 of the
CLCNKB gene that resulted in premature termination (trp610 to ter;
W610X).

.0010
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 3, WITH HYPOCALCIURIA
CLCNKB, IVS2AS, G-C, -1

In a Japanese patient who had been diagnosed with classic Bartter
syndrome (607364) but who presented with hypocalciuria, Fukuyama et al.
(2004) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CLCNKB
gene. One was a G-to-C transversion at the 3-prime splice site of intron
2; the other was a premature termination mutation (W610X; 602023.0009).

.0011
BARTTER SYNDROME, TYPE 4B
CLCNKB, IVS17DS, G-A, +1

In a 2-year-old Japanese girl with a severe form of Bartter syndrome
with sensorineural deafness (613090), Nozu et al. (2008) identified a
heterozygous G-to-A transition in intron 7 of the CLCNKB gene, resulting
in a splice site mutation, and a heterozygous mutation in the CLCNKA
gene (Q260X; 602024.0002), both inherited from the father. The maternal
allele had a 12-kb deletion including portions of both CLCNKA and
CLCNKB. Neither parent was clinically affected. The findings indicated
clear digenic inheritance in this patient and confirmed that loss of
function of all 4 alleles of the CLCNKA and CLCNKB genes can result in
Bartter syndrome type 4B.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Collagens are major structural components of the extracellular matrix.
Type II collagen, also called cartilage collagen, is the major collagen
synthesized by chondrocytes. The same type of collagen occurs in the
vitreous. Type II collagen is comprised of 3 alpha-1(II) chains. These
are synthesized as larger procollagen chains, which contain N- and
C-terminal amino acid sequences called propeptides. After secretion into
the extracellular matrix, the propeptides are cleaved, forming the
mature type II collagen molecule (summary by Strom and Upholt, 1984 and
Cheah et al., 1985).

CLONING

Strom and Upholt (1984) isolated overlapping genomic DNA clones
containing most of the coding sequences for chicken type II procollagen.
They found that the chicken type II gene is 2 to 3 times more compact
than the chicken type I alpha-2 gene (COL1A2; 120160) due to smaller
introns. The coding sequence shows about 75% homology with type I
alpha-1 (COL1A1; 120150) and 63 to 67% homology with type I alpha-2 and
type III (COL3A1; 120180) sequences. Base composition and codon usage of
type II are very similar to alpha-1(I) and different from alpha-2(I) and
type III. The chicken type II gene appears to be present in single copy
per haploid genome. Using probes corresponding to the chicken COL2A1
procollagen gene to screen a recombinant human DNA library, Strom and
Upholt (1984) isolated a portion of the human COL2A1 gene.

Sangiorgi et al. (1984) isolated from a cartilage cDNA library a bovine
clone encoding the pro-alpha-1(II) collagen chain. Because of the close
homology of bovine and human collagens, the bovine clone could be used
to isolate the corresponding gene from a human genomic library.

By comparison of amino acid sequences, van der Rest et al. (1986) showed
that chondrocalcin is the C-propeptide of type II procollagen.
Chondrocalcin is a calcium-binding protein found in developing fetal
cartilage matrix and in growth plate cartilage when and where
mineralization occurs in the lower hypertrophic zone. It appears to play
a role in enchondral ossification. The new evidence on its identity to
C-propeptide indicates that it is also important in assembly of the
triple helix of type II collagen. See 156550 for evidence of abnormal
processing of the C-propeptide of type II collagen resulting in
imperfect fibril assembly and the clinical disorder called Kniest
dysplasia.

Studying the gerbil, Slepecky et al. (1992) demonstrated that types II
and IX (120210) collagen show colocalization in the inner ear.

Wu and Eyre (1995) provided evidence that what was formerly termed the
alpha-3 chain of type XI collagen (COL11A3) is actually transcribed from
the COL2A1 gene.

MAPPING

By analysis of DNA from human-mouse cell hybrids, Sangiorgi et al.
(1984) localized the COL2A1 gene to chromosome 12. The results were
confirmed by similar experiments with the bovine cDNA probe. Using a
cloned gene as a probe on Southern blots of DNA from a panel of
interspecies somatic cell hybrids, Solomon et al. (1985) also assigned
the COL2A1 locus to chromosome 12.

By somatic cell hybrid studies and in situ hybridization,
Huerre-Jeanpierre et al. (1986) assigned COL2A1 to 12q13.1-q13.2 and
COL3A1 to 2q31-q32.3. Law et al. (1986) used a cosmid clone of the
entire COL2A1 gene in Southern analysis of DNA from somatic cell hybrids
containing segments of chromosome 12. Two hybrids contained a similar
terminal deletion of 12q14.3-qter but 1 was positive for the gene and 1
negative. This led Law et al. (1986) to conclude that the gene is
located in 12q14.3.

Takahashi et al. (1990) described a 'new' nonisotopic method of in situ
hybridization. It involved replication of R-bands by incorporation of
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into cells synchronized with thymidine.
Fluorescent signals could be detected on R-banded prometaphases stained
with propidium iodide. They illustrated the strength of the system by
refining the localization of the COL2A1 gene to 12q13.11-q13.12. By
nonisotopic in situ hybridization, Takahashi et al. (1990) showed that
the COL2A1 gene is immediately proximal to the fragile site
fra(12)(q13.1).

GENE FUNCTION

Lovell-Badge et al. (1987) introduced a cosmid containing the human type
II collagen gene, including 4.5 kb of 5-prime and 2.2 kb of 3-prime
flanking DNA, into mouse embryonic cells in vitro. Human type II
collagen mRNA was found only in tissues that showed transcription from
the endogenous (mouse) gene, and human type II collagen was found in
cartilage. The findings indicated that the cis-acting requirements for
correct temporal and spatial regulation of the gene were fulfilled by
the introduced DNA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Several skeletal and ocular disorders have been found to be caused by
mutation in the COL2A1 gene. These are sometimes referred to as type II
collagenopathies.

- Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia Congenita

The first evidence for a defect in COL2A1 in SED congenita (183900) and
in Langer-Saldino achondrogenesis (200610) was the finding of abnormal
patterns of digestion of type II collagen by cyanogen bromide, as
demonstrated by Horton (1987). Confirmation of the defect in SED
congenita was provided by demonstration of mutation in COL2A1
(120140.0001 and 120140.0002).

- Achondrogenesis Type II

Godfrey and Hollister (1988) presented evidence that the patient they
studied with a lethal perinatal form of short-limbed dwarfism (200610)
was heterozygous for an abnormal pro-alpha-1(II) chain which impaired
the assembly and/or folding of type II collagen. Vissing et al. (1989)
demonstrated that the mutation in the type II procollagen gene was a
single base change that converted the codon for glycine (GGC) at amino
acid 943 to a codon for serine (AGC) (120140.0002).

- Stickler Syndrome, Type I

Francomano et al. (1987, 1987) demonstrated absolute linkage of COL2A1
and Stickler syndrome (108300); a total lod score of 3.96 at theta = 0.0
was obtained. In a family with Stickler syndrome, Ahmad et al. (1990,
1991) identified a mutation in the COL2A1 gene (120140.0005).

Mutation in the COL2A1 gene (120140.0014) has also been found in a
nonsyndromic ocular form of type I Stickler syndrome (609508).

- Osteoarthritis Associated with Chondrodysplasia

Knowlton et al. (1989) found tight linkage (no recombination) of the
COL2A1 gene with a precocious form of familial primary generalized
osteoarthritis (OA) associated with chondrodysplasia (604864). In the
full report of this family, Knowlton et al. (1990) stated that a
16-year-old male had osteoarthritis of the middle metacarpophalangeal
joints and hips as well as bilateral osteochondritis dissecans of the
capitellum. A 38-year-old female also had osteoarthritis of the spine,
wrists, proximal interphalangeal joints, and distal interphalangeal
joints. Vertebral bodies were flattened with Schmorl nodes. Linkage
analysis suggested that the mutation is in the COL2A1 locus with a
maximum lod score of 2.39 in multipoint analysis. Morphometrics
demonstrated a short trunk producing abnormally low upper segment to
lower segment ratio. A mutation in the COL2A1 gene (120140.0003) in
affected members of the kindred described by Knowlton et al. (1990) was
identified by Ala-Kokko et al. (1990).

Nelson et al. (1998) presented further evidence that the synthesis of
type II collagen is increased in osteoarthritis. Using an immunoassay,
they showed that the content of the C-propeptide of type II procollagen,
released extracellularly from the newly synthesized molecule, is
directly related to the synthesis of this molecule in healthy and
osteoarthritic articular cartilage. In OA cartilage, the content of the
type II procollagen is often markedly elevated (mean 7.6-fold). The
increase in type II procollagen in OA cartilage was not reflected in
serum, where a significant reduction was observed.

- Kniest Dysplasia

Wilkin et al. (1999) noted that 10 of 12 previously described dominant
mutations in the COL2A1 gene in patients with Kniest dysplasia caused
small deletions in the type II collagen molecule. They added 4 new
mutations, bringing the total to 16. All 4 new mutations were also small
deletions; a fifth patient was found to have a previously reported 28-bp
deletion (120140.0012).

COL2A1 has 10 in-frame CGA codons that can mutate to TGA stop codons by
a methylation-deamination mechanism. Wilkin et al. (2000) analyzed these
10 codons using restriction endonuclease analysis or allele-specific
amplification. Mutations at 5 COL2A1 CGA codons were identified in 8 of
40 patients with Stickler syndrome, suggesting that these are common
sites of mutation in this disorder.

Korkko et al. (2000) performed COL2A1 mutation analysis on 12 patients
with achondrogenesis type II/hypochondrogenesis, using conformation
sensitive gel electrophoresis, followed by sequencing. Mutations were
identified in all patients. Ten had single base substitutions, 1 had a
change in a consensus RNA splice site, and 1 was an 18-bp deletion of
coding sequences. Mutations were widely distributed across the gene.

In 2 sporadic cases of the Torrance type of platyspondylic skeletal
dysplasia (151210), Nishimura et al. (2004) identified de novo mutations
in the COL2A1 gene (120140.0039-120140.0040).

- Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head and Legg-Calve-Perthes
Disease

Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH; 608805) causes disability
that often requires surgical intervention. Most cases of ANFH are
sporadic, but Liu et al. (2005) identified 3 families in which there was
autosomal dominant inheritance of the disease with mapping of the
phenotype to 12q13. Liu et al. (2005) carried out haplotype analysis in
the families, selected candidate genes from the critical interval for an
ANFH on 12q13, and sequenced the promoter and exonic regions of the
COL2A1 gene from persons with inherited and sporadic forms of ANFH. In 2
of the families they identified the same gly1170-to-ser mutation
(120140.0043), on different haplotype backgrounds. The gly717-to-ser
mutation was detected in the third family (120140.0044).

Miyamoto et al. (2007) identified the gly1170-to-ser mutation
(120140.0043) in affected members of a Japanese family with an autosomal
dominant disorder manifesting as Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD;
150600), a form of ANFH in growing children.

In a 40-year-old man who was diagnosed with avascular necrosis of the
femoral head at 18 years of age and underwent bilateral hip replacement
at 33 years of age, Kannu et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
missense mutation in the C-propeptide region of the COL2A1 gene
(120140.0054). The authors noted that mutations in the C-propeptide
region typically cause significant skeletal findings unlike those found
in this patient.

- Otospondylomegaepiphyseal Dysplasia

Otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED; 215150) is a skeletal
dysplasia characterized by severe sensorineural hearing loss, enlarged
epiphyses, and early onset of osteoarthritis. Miyamoto et al. (2005)
identified a novel COL2A1 mutation at a splice acceptor site within
intron 10 (709-2A-G; 120140.0048) in a patient with OSMED. This mutation
caused a skipping of exon 11, and of exons 11 and 13. These
exon-skipping events were presumed to cause an in-frame deletion of the
triple helical region of the COL2A1 product. Mutations in the COL11A2
gene (120290) had been reported as a cause for OSMED. The report
confirmed the overlap between type II and type XI collagenopathies.

- Other Disorders Caused by COL2A1 Mutations

Other disorders caused by mutation in the COL2A1 gene include
spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (SMD; 184252; see 120140.0013); Strudwick
type of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (184250; see 120140.0017);
multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with myopia and conductive deafness
(132450; see 120140.0029); spondyloperipheral dysplasia (271700; see
120140.0030); platyspondylic skeletal dysplasia, Torrance type (151210;
see 120140.0039); Czech dysplasia (609162; see 120140.0018);
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (see 609508; see 120140.0045); and
vitreoretinopathy with phalangeal epiphyseal dysplasia (120140.0037).

- Associations Pending Confirmation

Helfgott et al. (1991) suggested that collagen type II may not only be
involved in the sensorineural deafness that accompanies hereditary
disorders such as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita and Stickler
syndrome but may also be the target of an autoimmune process in some
cases of acquired bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing loss.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the COL2A1
gene and myopia, see MYP3 (603221).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Liberfarb et al. (2003) performed genotype/phenotype correlations in 47
affected members from 10 families with 7 defined mutations in the COL2A1
gene based on review of medical records and clinical evaluation of 25
additional family members from 6 of the 10 families. The ages ranged
from 2 to 73 years with a mean age of 34.7 years. The classic Stickler
phenotype was expressed clinically in all 10 Stickler families with
COL2A1 mutations and all had evidence of vitreous degeneration type 1.
Myopia was present in 41 of 47 family members. There was considerable
interfamilial and intrafamilial variability in clinical expression. The
prevalence of certain clinical features was a function of age. Liberfarb
et al. (2003) concluded that it is difficult to predict the severity of
the phenotype based on the genotype of COL2A1 mutation.

Nishimura et al. (2005) searched for COL2A1 mutations in 56 families
suspected of having type II collagenopathies and found 38 mutations in
41 families. There were no radiologic differences between the cases with
and those without mutations. Phenotypes for all 22 missense mutations
and 1 in-frame deletion in the triple helical region fell along the SED
spectrum. Glycine-to-serine substitutions resulted in alternating zones
that produced more severe and milder phenotypes; glycine-to-nonserine
residue substitutions exclusively created more severe phenotypes. The
gradient of the SED spectrum did not necessarily correlate with the
occurrence of extraskeletal manifestations. All 9 truncation or splice
site mutations in the triple helical or N-propeptide region caused
either Stickler syndrome type I or Kniest dysplasia (156550), and
extraskeletal changes were consistently present in both phenotypes. All
6 C-propeptide mutations produced a range of atypical skeletal
phenotypes and created ocular, but not otolaryngologic, changes.

Hoornaert et al. (2006) noted that the majority of COL2A1 mutations are
substitutions of obligatory glycine residues in the triple helical
domain; of the few nonglycine missense mutations that have been
reported, arginine-to-cysteine substitutions predominate. Hoornaert et
al. (2006) investigated the clinical and radiologic phenotype in 11
patients in whom they had identified arg-to-cys mutations in the COL2A1
gene. Each mutation resulted in a rather constant and site-specific
phenotype, but a perinatally lethal disorder was never observed.
Spondyloarthropathy with normal stature and no ocular involvement were
features of patients with the R75C (120140.0018), R519C (120140.0003),
or R1076C mutation. Short third and fourth toes were a distinguishing
feature of the R75C mutation, and brachydactyly with enlarged finger
joints was a key feature of the R1076C substitution. Stickler dysplasia
with brachydactyly was observed in patients with the R704C (120140.0029)
mutation. The R365C (120140.0033) and R789C (120140.0016) mutations
resulted in classic Stickler dysplasia and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia
congenita, respectively.

mutations in the COL2A1 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Vandenberg et al. (1991) found that transgenic mice carrying a partially
deleted human COL2A1 gene developed the phenotype of a chondrodysplasia
with dwarfism, short and thick limbs, short snout, cranial bulge, cleft
palate, and delayed mineralization of bone. In cultured chondrocytes
from transgenic mice, the minigene was expressed as shortened
pro-alpha-1(II) chains that were disulfide-linked to normal mouse type
II collagen chains. Therefore, the phenotype was probably explained by
depletion of endogenous mouse type II procollagen through the phenomenon
of procollagen suicide. Garofalo et al. (1991) generated transgenic mice
harboring a glycine-to-cysteine mutation at residue 85 of the triple
helical domain of mouse type II collagen. Offspring displayed severe
chondrodysplasia with short limbs and trunk, craniofacial deformities,
and cleft palate. Affected pups died of acute respiratory distress
caused by inability to inflate the lungs at birth. Electron microscopic
analysis showed a pronounced decrease in the number of typical thin
cartilage collagen fibrils, distention of the rough endoplasmic
reticulum of chondrocytes, and the presence of abnormally large banded
collagen fibril bundles. Garofalo et al. (1991) postulated that the
abnormally thick collagen bundles were related to a defect in
crosslinking. They pointed out similarities to the chondrodysplasias of
the spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia group.

Li et al. (1995) used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells
to prepare transgenic mice with an inactivated COL2A1 gene. Heterozygous
mice had minimal phenotypic changes. Homozygous mice were delivered
vaginally but died either just before or shortly after birth. In these
mice the cartilage consisted of highly disorganized chondrocytes with a
complete lack of extracellular fibrils discernible by electron
microscopy. There was no endochondral bone or epiphyseal growth plate in
long bones; however, many skeletal structures such as the cranium and
ribs were normally developed and mineralized. Li et al. (1995) concluded
that a well-organized cartilage matrix is required as a primary tissue
for development of some components of the skeleton but is not essential
for others.

Gaiser et al. (2002) constructed a transgenic mouse model of SED
congenita using a type II collagen transgene with an arg789-to-cys
change (R789C; 120140.0016) in combination with a murine Col2a1 promoter
directing the gene expression to cartilage. Mice carrying the transgene
were shorter overall, had shorter limbs with disorganized growth plates,
a short nose, cleft palate, and died at birth. Using cell culture
experiments and molecular modeling, Gaiser et al. (2002) suggested that
this Y-position mutation acts in a dominant-negative way, resulting in
destabilization of collagen molecules during assembly, reduction in the
number of fibrils formed, and abnormal cartilage template function.
Donahue et al. (2003) identified a naturally occurring arg1147-to-cys
mutation in the Col2a1 gene in the mouse which resulted in recessive SED
congenita with a less severe phenotype, as indicated by the fact that
the mice survived to adulthood and reproduced normally.

HISTORY

The following is an account of a temporarily confusing aspect of the
collagen II gene. Weiss et al. (1982) described a collagen gene isolated
in a 40-kb cosmid clone, cosHco11, which has some sequence homology to
the alpha-1(I) gene, but which is clearly a different gene. Using this
collagen alpha-1(I)-like probe on Southern blots of DNA from somatic
cell hybrids, Solomon et al. (1984) found that the gene segregated with
chromosome 12 and is not syntenic with the alpha-2(I) gene assigned to
chromosome 7 (120160) or the alpha-1(I) gene assigned to chromosome 17
(120150). This gene contains an RFLP with HindIII. A 300-basepair
deletion in the alpha-1(I)-like gene mapped by Solomon et al. (1984) was
demonstrated by Pope et al. (1984) in a father and son with one form of
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome II (EDS II; 130010). The deletion was found at or
near the 3-prime end of the gene and was not identified in other cases
of EDS II or in 400 normal controls. It was found, however, in 4 babies
with lethal osteogenesis imperfecta congenita. The father and son with
EDS II and the deletion showed altered collagen fibril size and shape.
Subsequently, the 'alpha-1(I)-like' gene was shown to encode the alpha
subunit of cartilage collagen and it was further shown that there is a
polymorphism in this gene that is frequent in Asiatic Indians (Sykes et
al., 1985). Of the 4 cases of Pope et al. (1984), 3 originated from
India or Sri Lanka. This experience illustrates the hazards of confusing
polymorphism with pathology.

Meulenbelt et al. (1996) determined the allele frequencies and pairwise
linkage disequilibria of RFLPs distributed over the COL2A1 gene in a
population of unrelated Dutch Caucasians. Their data indicated that
disease-related population studies should include a minimum of 4 RFLPs.

Strom (1984) purported to find abnormality of the type II collagen gene
in achondroplasia. If such a defect were present, one would expect
ocular abnormality in achondroplasia inasmuch as type II collagen is
present in vitreous. SED congenita is a more plausible candidate for a
structural defect of type II collagen because it is a dominant disorder
that combines skeletal dysplasia with vitreous degeneration and deafness
(experimental studies with antibodies to type II collagen indicate that
this collagen type is represented in the inner ear; Yoo et al., 1983).
The work of Strom (1984) may be technically flawed.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA CONGENITA
COL2A1, 390-BP DEL

In a patient with autosomal dominant spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia
congenita (183900), Lee et al. (1989) demonstrated a heterozygous
in-frame deletion of exon 48 of the COL2A1 gene, which encodes amino
acid residues 964-999 of the triple helical of domain of the protein.

.0002
HYPOCHONDROGENESIS
COL2A1, GLY943SER

In a patient described by Godfrey and Hollister (1988) with 'a
relatively mild case of type II achondrogenesis-hypochondrogenesis' (see
200610), Vissing et al. (1989) demonstrated heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition in exon 46 of the COL2A1 gene that converted glycine-943 to
serine (G943S). The substitution disrupted the invariant Gly-X-Y
structural motif necessary for perfect helix formation and led to an
excessive overmodification, intracellular retention, and reduced
secretion of type II collagen.

.0003
OSTEOARTHRITIS WITH MILD CHONDRODYSPLASIA
OSTEOARTHRITIS WITH MILD SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, INCLUDED
COL2A1, ARG519CYS

In the kindred described by Knowlton et al. (1990) with osteoarthritis
associated with mild chondrodysplasia (604864), Ala-Kokko et al. (1990)
found a change from arginine to cysteine at position 519 of the
alpha-1(II) chain. In an affected family member who underwent hip
surgery, Eyre et al. (1991) demonstrated that approximately one-fourth
of the alpha-1(II) chains present in the polymeric extracellular
collagen of the patient's cartilage contained the arg519-to-cys
substitution. The protein exhibited other abnormal properties including
disulfide-bonded alpha-1(II) dimers and signs of posttranslational
overmodification. Holderbaum et al. (1993) referred to 2 further
families with the arg519-to-cys mutation. They reported studies
suggesting that the mutation arose independently in at least 2 of the 3
known affected families. Williams et al. (1995) found the same mutation
in a fourth family with early-onset osteoarthritis and late-onset
spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia.

Bleasel et al. (1998) reported that the arg519-to-cys mutation in COL2A1
had been identified in 5 families with mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia
(see 183900) and precocious osteoarthritis. Haplotype analysis
identified 3 distinct mutation-bearing haplotypes, with 3 families
sharing a common haplotype. For the 3 distinct haplotypes to have
derived from a single founder, 3 independent recombination events were
required. Thus, the arg519 codon appears to represent a possible site of
recurrent mutations in COL2A1, an uncommon phenomenon in collagen genes.

.0004
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA CONGENITA
COL2A1, 45-BP DUP, EX48

In a sporadic case of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (183900), Tiller et
al. (1990) found an internal tandem duplication of 45 basepairs within
exon 48 of COL2A1, resulting in the addition of 15 amino acids to the
triple-helical domain of the protein. The abnormal molecule showed
excessive posttranslational modification. The mutation was not carried
by either parent, indicating a new dominant mutation. DNA sequence
homology in the area of the duplication suggested that the mutation may
have arisen by unequal crossover between related sequences.

.0005
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I
COL2A1, ARG732TER

In a family with Stickler syndrome (108300), Ahmad et al. (1990, 1991)
found a single base mutation altering the arginine at amino acid 732 of
the triple helical domain of COL2A1 to a stop codon. The mutation
altered a CG dinucleotide and converted the codon CGA to TGA. This
mutation was located in exon 40. Ahmad et al. (1991) noted that the
mutation produced marked changes in the eye, which contains only small
amounts of type II collagen, but had relatively mild effects on the many
cartilaginous structures of the body that are rich in the same protein.

.0006
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, NAMAQUALAND TYPE
COL2A1

Beighton et al. (1984) concluded that the skeletal disorder they
identified in 45 persons in 5 generations of a kindred of mixed ancestry
in Namaqualand, South Africa, represented a distinct entity. Discomfort
in the hips develops in childhood and the course is progressive, with
handicap in middle age. General health is good, height is not
significantly reduced, and no extraskeletal involvement has been
identified. The major changes are in the femoral capital epiphyses,
which are flattened and fragmented; secondary degenerative arthropathy
develops at a later stage. Platyspondyly of variable but mild degree is
present in about 60% of affected persons. Other minor changes, including
iliac exostoses, are present in some. The pedigree findings indicate
autosomal dominant inheritance. Learmonth et al. (1987) pointed out that
the maximal changes in the femoral capital epiphyses lead to severe
progressive degenerative osteoarthropathy of the hip joint that
frequently necessitates prosthetic joint replacement in adulthood. Sher
et al. (1991) showed by linkage studies that NSED and the COL2A1 gene
are closely linked with no recombination (lod = 7.98).

.0007
HYPOCHONDROGENESIS
COL2A1, GLY574SER

In a case of hypochondrogenesis (see 200610), Horton et al. (1992)
detected a subtle mutation in the COL2A1 gene by use of a chondrocyte
culture system and PCR-cDNA scanning analysis. Chondrocytes obtained
from cartilage biopsies were dedifferentiated and expanded in monolayer
culture and then redifferentiated by culture over agarose. Single-strand
conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing analysis identified a
G-to-A transition, resulting in substitution of glycine by serine at
amino acid 574 in the triple-helical domain of type II procollagen. The
morphologic assessment of cartilage-like structures produced in culture
and electrophoretic analysis of collagens synthesized by the cultured
chondrocytes suggested that the glycine substitution interfered with
conversion of type II procollagen to collagen, impaired intracellular
transport and secretion of the molecule, and disrupted collagen fibril
assembly.

.0008
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I
COL2A1, 1-BP DEL, EX40

In a family with Stickler syndrome (108300), Brown et al. (1992) found
that 4 affected members had deletion of a single basepair resulting in a
translational frameshift in exon 40 of the COL2A1 gene. The mutation was
not found in any of 5 clinically unaffected family members or in any of
15 unrelated control patients. All affected members had abnormal
vitreous syneresis and all had retinal perivascular pigmentation.
Retinal detachments occurred in 3 of the 4 affected patients. Three of
the 4 had peripheral cortical 'wedge' cataracts, and the fourth had
extensive nuclear sclerosis. In all 4 affected patients, there were
abnormalities of the palate: bilateral torus palatini, linea alba with
submucous cleft palate, bifid uvula, and 'notched' hard palate. All
patients reported severe joint pains, and radiologic changes suggesting
epiphyseal dysplasia were found in all 4. One patient had had left total
hip replacement at a relatively young age. Palatal and ocular changes
were illustrated by photographs, and radiographs of the skeletal changes
were presented. The deletion was reported to involve a thymidine
nucleotide at position 18 of exon 40. This resulted in a translational
frameshift, with formation of a nonsense codon, TGA, downstream in exon
42, leading to premature termination of translation at that point. The
deletion also created a new MspI restriction site.

HYPOCHONDROGENESIS
COL2A1, GLY853GLU

In an infant with a severe form of skeletal dysplasia who required
continuous respiratory support until his death at 3 months of age,
Bogaert et al. (1992) demonstrated a gly853-to-glu mutation resulting
from a GGA-to-GAA transition in the COL2A1 gene. The patient was
heterozygous. The radiologic features were thought to be those of
hypochondrogenesis (see 200610). Unilateral polydactyly had been noted
at birth.

.0010
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I
COL2A1, ARG9TER

In a family with Stickler syndrome (108300), Ahmad et al. (1993) found a
single-base mutation that converted codon 9 of the COL2A1 gene. (The
amino acids of the alpha-1 chain were numbered with the standard
convention in which the first amino acid in the triple-helical domain is
numbered as +1 (Baldwin et al., 1989).) The mutation changed a CGA codon
(arginine) to TGA (stop) codon. This mutation was located in exon 7. The
PCR products contained both C and T, indicating that the patient was
heterozygous for the mutation. The proband had been identified in a
cleft palate clinic at the age of 1 year. He had severe myopia and was
at the eighth percentile for height. Pelvic x-rays demonstrated small
femoral heads with dumbbell-shaped enlargements of both ends of the
femurs. Members in 3 generations and 4 sibships had severe myopia, often
with other ocular manifestations.

.0011
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA CONGENITA
COL2A1, GLY997SER

Cole et al. (1993) found that a child with SED congenita (183900) was
heterozygous for a G-to-A transition in exon 48 of the COL2A1 gene that
resulted in the substitution of glycine-997 by serine in the triple
helical domain of the type II collagen chain.

.0012
KNIEST DYSPLASIA
COL2A1, 28-BP DEL

Winterpacht et al. (1993) demonstrated a 28-bp deletion spanning the
3-prime exon/intron boundary of exon 12 in a 2-year-old girl with Kniest
dysplasia (156550). The mother presented with a milder phenotype
consistent with the Stickler syndrome. She was shown to have mosaicism
for the same deletion.

Wilkin et al. (1999) found this same mutation occurring at the junction
between exon 12 and intron 12 of the COL2A1 gene in a patient with
Kniest syndrome. The mutation deleted the splice donor site and was
predicted to result in exon skipping in the mRNA encoded from the mutant
allele. The female patient reported by Wilkin et al. (1999), their
patient 4, had previously been reported by Siggers (1974) and Siggers et
al. (1974), and by Maumenee and Traboulsi (1985). The diagnosis of
Kniest dysplasia had been made at the age of 10.5 years. At that time,
her height was 110.5 cm (height age 4 10/12 years). She had a flat and
round face, prominent eyes with high myopia, flat bridge of the nose,
with broad and prominent forehead, and a cleft uvula. Radiographs
demonstrated severe platyspondyly, with greatest involvement of the
dorsal spine. The superior and inferior endplates of the vertebral
bodies were quite irregular, with spotted mineralization. There was
considerable middorsal kyphosis and lumbar lordosis, as well as moderate
scoliosis. The anterior-posterior diameters of the vertebral bodies
appeared relatively wide, as did the interpedicular spaces. The limbs
and hands had short bones, with shafts of normal to slightly diminished
diameter, and greatly flared metaphyses and epiphyses. Ossification of
the epiphyses was irregular and spotty, with some of the cartilaginous
epiphyseal plates relatively wide, particularly at the distal radius and
ulna. Wilkin et al. (1999) pointed out that the deletion in this case
began with 7 nucleotides in exon 12 that duplicated 7 nucleotides (+3
through +9) of intron 12, creating the basis for homologous
recombination with unequal crossing-over leading to deletion.

.0013
SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, STRUDWICK TYPE
COL2A1, GLY154ARG

In a 16-year-old Finnish boy with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia
(184250), Vikkula et al. (1993) demonstrated a 1063G-A transition in
exon 14 of the COL1A2 gene, which resulted in the conversion of gly154
to arg (G154R). This was a heterozygous de novo mutation which was not
found in any other skeletal dysplasia patient studied in Finland.

Kaitila et al. (1996) found the same de novo heterozygous G154R mutation
in an unrelated 26-year-old Finnish woman with spondyloepimetaphyseal
dysplasia and provided follow-up on the patient reported by Vikkula et
al. (1993). Both patients had been followed since the newborn period at
Helsinki University Children's Hospital. The clinical phenotype was
disproportionate short stature with varus/valgus deformities of the
lower limbs requiring corrective osteotomies, and lumbar lordosis. The
skeletal radiographs showed an evolution from short tubular bones,
delayed epiphyseal development, and mild vertebral involvement to severe
metaphyseal dysplasia with dappling irregularities, and hip 'dysplasia.'
The metaphyseal abnormalities disappeared by adulthood.

.0014
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I, NONSYNDROMIC OCULAR
COL2A1, GLY67ASP

Korkko et al. (1993) identified a substitution of aspartate for glycine
at position 67 in the alpha-1 chain of type II collagen in a family in
which affected members had early-onset cataracts, lattice degeneration
of the retina, and retinal detachment without involvement of nonocular
tissues. Comparison with previously reported mutations suggested to
Korkko et al. (1993) that premature termination codons in the COL2A1
gene are a frequent cause of Stickler syndrome, but mutations in the
COL2A1 gene that replace glycine codons with codons for a bulkier amino
acid can produce a broad spectrum of disorders ranging from lethal
chondrodysplasia to a syndrome involving only ocular tissues. Korkko et
al. (1993) noted phenotypic similarity to the family described by Wagner
(1938) (see 143200). Richards et al. (2006) suggested that the disorder
in this family was more likely to be a predominantly ocular form of
Stickler syndrome type I (see 609508).

.0015
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I
COL2A1, PRO846TER

In a family with Stickler syndrome (108300) in members of 4 successive
generations, Ritvaniemi et al. (1993) found a deletion of a T in the
third base position of the codon CCT for proline at position 846 of the
collagen II alpha-1 chain. The deletion of the T shifted the reading
frame and generated premature termination. Ritvaniemi et al. (1993)
stated that this was the fourth example of a premature termination codon
causing Stickler syndrome.

.0016
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA CONGENITA
COL2A1, ARG789CYS

In a 4-year-old girl with clinical and radiographic features typical of
SED congenita (183900), Chan et al. (1993) found heterozygosity for a
2913C-T transition in exon 14, resulting in an arg789-to-cys (R789C)
substitution. The mutation resulted in the loss of an MaeII cleavage
site that was used to confirm the fact that the proband was heterozygous
and that neither parent had the mutation. Type II collagen extracted
from cartilage and from cultured chondrocytes was approximately
one-third of the mutant type and secretion of molecules containing
mutant chains was impaired. The thermal stability of the collagen
extracted from cartilage was normal, however.

In a patient with SED congenita, Chan et al. (1995) identified the R789C
mutation. The substitution of a cysteine for an arginine in the Y
position of the gly-X-Y triplet is noteworthy because cysteine is not
normally found in the triple-helical domain of type II collagen in any
species (Kuivaniemi et al., 1997). A cysteine at this position provides
the opportunity for disulfide bonds to form, thus disrupting the
formation of collagen fibrils. Two other arg-to-cys mutations have been
described in the COL2A1 gene: R519C (120140.0003), resulting in
osteoarthritis with mild chondrodysplasia (604864), and R75C
(120140.0018), resulting in spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with precocious
osteoarthritis (609162).

.0017
SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, STRUDWICK TYPE
COL2A1, GLY709CYS

Tiller et al. (1993, 1995) demonstrated that cartilage from 3 patients
with SEMD Strudwick (184250) contained both normal alpha-1(II) collagen
chains and chains that were posttranslationally overmodified. Cyanogen
bromide peptide analysis and protein microsequencing of type II collagen
from 1 patient demonstrated an amino acid substitution, gly709-to-cys,
in the abnormal alpha chains. Direct DNA sequencing showed
heterozygosity for a GGC-to-TGC transversion at the last glycine codon
of exon 39.

.0018
CZECH DYSPLASIA
COL2A1, ARG75CYS

This mutation has also been designated arg275-to-cys (R275C) based on a
different numbering system.

In a family living in the Chiloe Islands, Chile, Williams et al. (1993)
demonstrated a heterozygous arg75-to-cys (R75C) mutation in the COL2A1
gene as the basis of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with shortened
metacarpals and metatarsals, precocious osteoarthritis, and
periarticular apatite-like calcific deposits. Seven individuals were
involved in 3 generations of the family. Complete physical examination,
anthropometric measurements, and radiographic studies of the spine and
peripheral joints in 16 family members revealed that 7 had
spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda, brachydactyly, precocious
osteoarthritis, and periarticular calcification, while 2 others had the
same syndrome without brachydactyly (Reginato et al., 1994). The
relationship of this type of SEDT to familial calcium pyrophosphate
dihydrate deposition disease (118600) and idiopathic hip dysplasia, both
endemic in Chiloe Islanders, required further investigation.

Hoornaert et al. (2007) performed targeted sequencing of exon 13 of the
COL2A1 gene in patients with Czech dysplasia (609162) because of
phenotypic similarities between individuals with this dysplasia and
patients with the R75C mutation. They identified heterozygosity for the
R75C mutation in 5 patients with Czech dysplasia, including 2 of the 4
original patients described with this disorder. All affected individuals
had normal height, spondyloarthropathy, and short postaxial toes.

In an affected father, daughter, and son from a Japanese family with
Czech dysplasia, Matsui et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for the
R275C mutation in the COL2A1 gene. The mutation was not found in the
unaffected mother. The authors stated that this was the first reported
family with Czech dysplasia that was not of European ancestry, and
family history was consistent with de novo occurrence of the disease in
the father.

.0019
KNIEST DYSPLASIA
COL2A1, IVS20, A-G, -2

Winterpacht et al. (1994) investigated the molecular defect in a girl
with Kniest dysplasia (156550) whose father had a very mild form of
spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC) with premature
osteoarthrosis. The father was found to be a mosaic for a mutation that
was present in nonmosaic state in the child: an A-to-G transition at the
3-prime end of intron 20 affecting the highly conserved AG dinucleotide
of the acceptor splice site. The result was the utilization of a cryptic
AG splice site located 18-bp downstream and a resulting in-frame
deletion of 18 bp from the mRNA. This situation has similarities to that
described in 120140.0012.

.0020
KNIEST DYSPLASIA
COL2A1, GLY103ASP

Wilkin et al. (1994) used SSCP to analyze an amplified genomic DNA
fragment containing exon 12, under suspicion because of its deletion in
a previously reported patient (120140.0012), from 7 individuals with
Kniest dysplasia (156550). An abnormality was identified in 1 patient
who was found on DNA sequence analysis to be heterozygous for a G-to-A
transition that implied substitution of glycine-103 of the triple
helical domain by aspartate. The mutation was not observed in DNA from
either of the clinically unaffected parents. Protein microsequencing
demonstrated expression of the abnormal allele in cartilage.

.0021
ACHONDROGENESIS, TYPE II
COL2A1, GLY769SER

In a fetus with type II achondrogenesis (200610), Chan et al. (1995)
described heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 2853 in
exon 441 of the COL2A1 gene, resulting in a gly769-to-ser substitution
within the triple helical domain of the type II collagen chain. The
result was complete absence of type II collagen in cartilage, which had
a gelatinous composition. Types I and III collagens were the main
species found in cartilage and synthesized by cultured chondrocytes
along with cartilage type XI collagen (120280). Cultured chondrocytes
produced a trace amount of type II collagen that was retained within the
cells and not secreted. In situ hybridization of cartilage sections
showed that the chondrocytes produced both type I and type II collagen
mRNA. Chan et al. (1995) noted that the gly769 substitution is situated
close to the mammalian collagenase cleavage site at gly775/leu776. The
abnormality was detected by ultrasonography at 19 weeks of gestation
when severe shortening of the limbs and trunk and marked edema around
the neck was noted. The pregnancy was terminated at 20 weeks of
gestation. External examination showed very short limbs, large head,
short trunk, bulging abdomen, and edema of the head and neck.
Radiographs, which were presented by Chan et al. (1995), showed very
short tubular bones with metaphyseal expansion and cupping, absent
ossification of the vertebrae and sacrum, small iliac wings with absent
ossification of the pubis and ischium, and short ribs, but relatively
normal ossification of the calvarium.

.0022
ACHONDROGENESIS, TYPE II
COL2A1, GLY691ARG

Mortier et al. (1995) examined a male fetus by ultrasound during the
third trimester and observed polyhydramnios and severe short-limb
dwarfism. The parents elected to induce delivery at 31 weeks of
gestation and the neonate, who had achondrogenesis type II (200610) died
soon after birth. There was severe shortening of the limbs and chest
with distention of the abdomen. The head was relatively large and the
neck appeared short. Radiographs showed absence of ossification of all
the vertebral bodies. The chest appeared bell-shaped with mild
shortening of the ribs. Anterior and posterior ends of the ribs were
flared and cupped. The width of the iliac wings was increased and the
greater sciatic notch was wide. The ischium and pubis were not ossified.
All the long bones were markedly shortened with flared and cupped
metaphyses. Electron microscopy showed inclusion bodies of dilated rough
endoplasmic reticulum in chondrocytes and the presence of sparse
collagen fibers in the cartilage matrix. Protein analysis of collagen
from cartilage indicated posttranslational overmodification of the major
cyanogen bromide peptides and suggested a mutation near the carboxyl
terminus of the type II collagen molecule. Mortier et al. (1995)
referred to reports of 3 other dominant mutations in the COL2A1 gene
resulting in substitutions for triple helical glycine residues near the
carboxy-terminal end of the alpha-1(II) chain and causing
hypochondrogenesis. Mortier et al. (1995) demonstrated a single base
change (G-to-C) that resulted in the substitution of glycine-691 by
arginine in the type II collagen triple helical domain.

.0023
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I
COL2A1, 1-BP DEL, EX50

By direct sequencing of the COL2A1 gene, Ahmad et al. (1995)
demonstrated that affected members of a family with Stickler syndrome
(108300) had a single base deletion in exon 50, resulting in a premature
stop codon in exon 51 in the globular C-propeptide of the COL2A1 gene.
The deletion involved a cytosine at position 92 in exon 50. Three
generations were affected in the family. The proband was referred for
cataract and total retinal detachment in 1 eye at the age of 3 years.
Marked genu valgum, hyperextensibility of joints, cleft palate, and
flattened facies were noted. Mild hearing loss was also documented. The
father's left eye had been blind since the age of 8 years secondary to a
detached retina. Retinal detachment on the right occurred at the age of
39 years. He also showed hyperextensibility of joints and some spinal
changes. The proband's paternal uncle suffered detached left retina
after diving into a swimming pool at age 15 years. Hyperextensibility of
joints and loss of hearing in the left ear were noted at the age of 35
years. Hyperextensible joints were present in other relatives and Pierre
Robin syndrome was noted in some.

.0024
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I
COL2A1, IVS17, A-G, -2

In the original Minnesota kindred on the basis of which Stickler et al.
(1965) defined the Stickler syndrome (108300), Williams et al. (1996)
identified a splice site mutation in the COL2A1 gene. They used
conformational sensitive gel electrophoresis (SSGE) to screen for
mutations in the entire gene. They noted a prominent heteroduplex in the
PCR product from a region of the gene including exons 17 to 20. Direct
sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA identified an A-to-G transition
at the -2 position at the 3-prime acceptor splice site of IVS17.
Sequencing of DNA from affected and unaffected family members confirmed
that the mutation segregated with the disease phenotype. RT-PCR analysis
of poly(A)+ RNA demonstrated that the mutant allele utilized a cryptic
splice site in exon 18 of the gene, eliminating 16 bp at the start of
exon 18. This frameshift eventually resulted in a premature termination
codon. Williams et al. (1996) stated that this was the first report of a
splice site mutation in classical Stickler syndrome. They provided a
satisfying historical context in which to view COL2A1 mutations in this
disorder.

.0025
KNIEST DYSPLASIA
COL2A1, 1-BP DEL, IVS18, G, +1

Spranger et al. (1997) demonstrated that the original patient reported
by Kniest (1952) had a single base (G) deletion involving the GT
dinucleotide of the start of intron 18 of the COL2A1 gene. From a review
of the molecular defect found in other cases of this disorder, Spranger
et al. (1997) concluded that the condition is caused by small in-frame
deletions often due to exon skipping as a result of COL2A1 splice site
mutations. Spranger et al. (1997) provided a useful follow-up on the
original patient, then 50 years of age. She was severely handicapped
with short stature, restricted joint mobility, and blindness, but was
mentally alert and led an active life. Radiologic findings at the age of
4.5 years and 29 years were presented.

.0026
KNIEST DYSPLASIA
COL2A1, IVS24, G-A, +5

In a neonatal lethal form of Kniest dysplasia (156500), Weis et al.
(1998) found deletion of 18 residues corresponding to exon 24 of the
COL2A1 sequence. Sequence analysis of an amplified genomic DNA fragment
identified a G-to-A transition in the +5 position of the splice donor
consensus sequence of intron 24 in 1 allele. Cartilage matrix analysis
showed that the abnormally short alpha-1(II) chain was present in
collagen molecules that had become cross-linked into fibrils. It
appeared that the normal and the short alpha-chains had combined to form
heterotrimeric molecules in which the chains were in register in both
directions from the deletion site, accommodated effectively by a loop
out of the normal chain exon 24 domain. Such an accommodation, with
potential overall shortening of the helical domain and hence
misalignment of intermolecular relationships within fibrils, offers a
common molecular mechanism by which a group of different mutations might
act to produce the Kniest phenotype. The patient, an infant girl, was
the product of a 37-week gestation and died of respiratory distress at
10 days of age. She had short limbs, clubfeet, cleft palate, midface
hypoplasia, and narrow chest. X-rays showed flattened vertebral bodies
with coronal clefts, slight shortening of the ribs, and dumbbell-shaped
femurs.

.0027
SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, STRUDWICK TYPE
COL2A1, GLY304CYS

See 120140.0017. In 2 unrelated patients with SEMD Strudwick (184250),
Tiller et al. (1995) found a gly304-to-cys mutation and a gly292-to-val
mutation in the COL2A1 gene.

.0029
EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, MULTIPLE, WITH MYOPIA AND CONDUCTIVE DEAFNESS
COL2A1, ARG704CYS

In an Afrikaner South African family with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia
with myopia and conductive deafness (132450), Ballo et al. (1998)
detected a heterozygous C-to-T transversion at nucleotide 2503 in exon
39 of the COL2A1 gene. This resulted in an arg-to-cys substitution at
residue number 704, occurring at the X position of the Gly-X-Y motif of
the collagen triple helix. Myopia and deafness characteristic of
Stickler syndrome (108300) were present, with radiologic findings
consistent with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED). COL2A1 mutations
causing Stickler syndrome have resulted in premature termination codons,
while mutations causing spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia were glycine
alterations or arg-to-cys substitutions at the Y position of the Gly-X-Y
unit. Ballo et al. (1998) stated that this mutation could represent the
first report of a nontermination COL2A1 mutation in Stickler syndrome
type 1, or the first report of a COL2A1 defect in an MED phenotype.

.0030
SPONDYLOPERIPHERAL DYSPLASIA
COL2A1, 5-BP DUP

Zabel et al. (1996) described a 5-bp duplication in exon 51 of the
COL2A1 gene, leading to a stop codon, in a patient with a distinct
phenotype labeled spondyloperipheral dysplasia (271700). The mutation
was present in heterozygous state and the patient was sporadic (new
mutation). The patient, a girl, was born to healthy, nonconsanguineous
parents and was 45 cm at birth. A skeletal dysplasia was suspected
because of rhizomelic shortening of the arms and legs. X-ray findings at
7 months of age suggested SED congenita. At the age of 14 years the
patient was 127.4 cm tall with short, broad fingers and very short toes
II-V. Additional findings were a slightly hypoplastic midface with
depressed nasal bridge, severe myopia, short neck and trunk, accentuated
lumbar lordosis, and limited extension of the elbow joints. Short
metacarpals were impressive in the hand x-rays, and very short toes II-V
were impressive in the photograph of the feet. The 5-bp duplication was
the first to be located at the C-terminal outside the helical domain of
COL2A1. It seemed to affect helix formation and produced changes of
chondrocyte morphology, collagen type II fibril structure, and cartilage
matrix composition.

.0031
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA CONGENITA
COL2A1, GLY973ARG

Sobetzko et al. (2000) described a newborn infant with an unusual
combination of syndactylies, macrocephaly, and severe skeletal
dysplasia. A history of digital anomalies in the father and grandfather
led to the diagnosis of dominantly inherited Greig cephalopolysyndactyly
syndrome (GCPS; 175700). Having explained the digital findings and
macrocephaly, the skeletal changes were thought to fit best congenital
SED (183900). Molecular analysis confirmed the presence of 2 dominant
mutations in the infant: a GLI3 mutation (E543X; 165240.0010), which was
present also in the father and grandfather, and a de novo COL2A1
mutation leading to an gly973-to-arg amino acid substitution. Thus, this
boy combined the Greig syndrome with a severe form of SED. The
diagnostic difficulties posed by the combination of 2 genetic disorders
and the usefulness of molecular diagnostics were well illustrated.

.0032
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I
COL2A1, IVS25DS, G-A, +1

Freddi et al. (2000) described a novel strategy for screening families
with type I Stickler syndrome (108300) due to nonsense mutations in the
COL2A1 gene, using a modified RNA-based protein truncation test. To
overcome the problem of the unavailability of collagen II-producing
cartilage cells, they performed RT-PCR on the illegitimate transcripts
of accessible cells (lymphoblasts and fibroblasts), which were
preincubated with cycloheximide to prevent nonsense mutation-induced
mRNA decay. The 5 overlapping RT-PCR fragments covering the COL2A1
coding region were then transcribed and translated in vitro to identify
smaller truncated protein products resulting from a premature stop
codon. Using this method, Freddi et al. (2000) screened a 4-generation
family with Stickler syndrome and identified a protein-truncating
mutation that was present in all affected individuals. Targeted
sequencing identified the mutation as a G-to-A transition at the +1
position of the 5-prime splice donor site of intron 25. The mutation led
to the activation of a cryptic splice site 8 bp upstream, causing
aberrant mRNA splicing and a translational frameshift that introduced a
premature stop codon. Mutant mRNA was undetectable without cycloheximide
protection, demonstrating that the mutant mRNA was subjected to
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.

.0033
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I
COL2A1, ARG365CYS

Richards et al. (2000) observed a recurrent arg365-to-cys (R365C)
mutation of the COL2A1 gene in 2 unrelated sporadic cases of Stickler
syndrome (108300). The mutation was located in the X position of the
Gly-X-Y triple helical region and resulted in the membranous vitreous
anomaly associated with haploinsufficiency.

.0034
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I, NONSYNDROMIC OCULAR
COL2A1, LEU467PHE

Richards et al. (2000) observed a leu467-to-phe (L467F) mutation of the
COL2A1 gene in a family with Stickler syndrome (108300) which produced
an unusual 'afibrillar' vitreous gel devoid of all normal lamellar
structure. Systemic involvement was mild, with many family members
lacking joint laxity or radiologic abnormality, hearing loss, midface
hypoplasia, abnormal nasal development, and midline clefting. Richards
et al. (2005) referred to the phenotype in this family as an atypical
form of Stickler syndrome/dominant rhegmatogenous retinal detachment
(609508). They noted that the amino acid substitution arose from a
20996C-T transition.

.0035
SPONDYLOEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA CONGENITA
COL2A1, THR1370MET

Unger et al. (2001) reported a child with double heterozygosity for
pseudoachondroplasia (177170), resulting from a mutation in the COMP
gene (600310.0014) and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (183900),
resulting from a thr1370-to-met mutation in the COL2A1 gene. The child
inherited pseudoachondroplasia from his mother and spondyloepiphyseal
dysplasia congenita from his father. He had clinical and radiographic
findings that were more severe than those in either disorder alone.

.0036
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I, NONSYNDROMIC OCULAR
COL2A1, 2-BP DEL, 4274GT

Gupta et al. (2002) examined a large French-Canadian kindred originally
described by Alexander and Shea (1965) as representing Wagner disease
(143200). In affected individuals, they found a novel frameshift
mutation (4274del2bp) in exon 2 leading to early truncation of the
COL2A1 protein (cys57 to stop; C57X). The mutation arose in an exon that
is selectively present in vitreous collagen mRNAs, but absent in
cartilage mRNAs through tissue-specific alternate splicing. The authors
concluded that the selective absence of exon 2 in cartilage explained
why this family did not manifest the progressive spondyloarthropathy of
Stickler syndrome (108300) that is a more common result of mutations in
COL2A1.

Richards et al. (2006) suggested that the disorder in this family was
more likely to be a predominantly ocular form of Stickler syndrome type
I (see 609508).

.0037
VITREORETINOPATHY WITH PHALANGEAL EPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA
COL2A1, GLY1105ASP

Richards et al. (2002) described a large family with dominantly
inherited rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, premature arthropathy, and
phalangeal epiphyseal dysplasia resulting in brachydactyly. Linkage to
the COL2A1 gene was demonstrated, and mutation analysis identified a
change at codon 1105 in exon 52 from GGC (gly) to GAC (asp) (G1105D) in
the C-propeptide region of the molecule. The gly-to-asp change occurred
in a region that is highly conserved in all fibrillar collagen
molecules. The resulting phenotype did not fit easily with preexisting
subgroups of the type II collagenopathies.

.0038
ACHONDROGENESIS, TYPE II
COL2A1, GLY316ASP

In 2 successive pregnancies of a healthy, nonconsanguineous young
couple, Faivre et al. (2004) observed lethal achondrogenesis type II
(200610). Heterozygosity for a 1340G-A transition in exon 22 of the
COL2A1 gene resulting in a gly316-to-asp (G316D) amino acid substitution
was identified in the second fetus. The mutation was not found in the
parents. Faivre et al. (2004) hypothesized germline mosaicism in 1 of
the parents as the explanation for the recurrence of this autosomal
dominant disorder.

.0039
PLATYSPONDYLIC SKELETAL DYSPLASIA, TORRANCE TYPE
SPONDYLOPERIPHERAL DYSPLASIA, INCLUDED
COL2A1, TYR1391CYS

In a sporadic case of the Torrance type of platyspondylic skeletal
dysplasia (151210) delivered stillborn at 34 weeks' gestation, Nishimura
et al. (2004) identified a de novo heterozygous 4172A-G transition in
exon 53 of the COL2A1 gene, resulting in a tyr1391-to-cys (Y1391C)
mutation affecting the C-propeptide region of the protein.

Hoornaert et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 4172A-G transition of
the COL2A1 gene in a girl originally diagnosed with Czech dysplasia
(case III of Kozlowski et al., 2004). The patient had significant
disproportionate short stature (-4.55 standard deviation at age 14) and
short toes. Hoornaert et al. (2007) suggested that this patient has
spondyloperipheral dysplasia (271700).

.0040
PLATYSPONDYLIC SKELETAL DYSPLASIA, TORRANCE TYPE
COL2A1, 4-BP DEL, 4413AGGG

In a sporadic case of the Torrance type of platyspondylic skeletal
dysplasia (151210), Nishimura et al. (2004) identified a de novo 4-bp
deletion in exon 54 of the COL2A1 gene, 4413delAGGG, resulting in a
frameshift with a premature stop at codon 1480. The phenotype, as
indicated by radiologic manifestations during the neonatal period,
evolved into that of Kniest-like dysplasia (see 156550) in childhood;
the patient, 5 years of age at the time of report, survived respiratory
problems in infancy.

.0041
SPONDYLOPERIPHERAL DYSPLASIA
COL2A1, 1-BP DEL, 4337G

In 2 patients with spondyloperipheral dysplasia (271700), Zankl et al.
(2004) identified mutations in the COL2A1 gene. The first patient had a
heterozygous 1-bp deletion at nucleotide 4337 in exon 52, resulting in a
frameshift at codon 1446 and a premature stop codon 25 amino acids
downstream. The second patient had a truncating mutation in exon 51 (see
120140.0042). Neither mutation was present in the patients' parents or
in 100 control chromosomes. Both patients had clubfeet, midface
hypoplasia, early-onset high grade myopia, platyspondyly, epiphyseal
dysplasia, and brachydactyly E-like changes developing in childhood. The
authors noted that the phenotype was remarkably similar to that
described by Zabel et al. (1996) (see 120140.0030).

.0042
SPONDYLOPERIPHERAL DYSPLASIA
COL2A1, CYS1438TER

In a patient with spondyloperipheral dysplasia (271700), Zankl et al.
(2004) identified a heterozygous 4314C-A transversion in exon 51 of the
COL2A1 gene, resulting in a cys1438-to-ter (C1438X) substitution. See
120140.0041.

.0043
AVASCULAR NECROSIS OF THE FEMORAL HEAD, PRIMARY
LEGG-CALVE-PERTHES DISEASE, INCLUDED
COL2A1, GLY1170SER

In 2 families with autosomal dominant avascular necrosis of the femoral
head (608805), Liu et al. (2005) identified a G-to-A transition in exon
50 of the COL2A1 gene, predicted to lead to the replacement of glycine
with serine at codon 1170 (G1170S) in a Gly-X-Y repeat of type II
collagen. The mutant allele occurred on a different haplotype background
in each of the 2 families.

Miyamoto et al. (2007) identified the same heterozygous 3508G-A mutation
in affected members of a Japanese family with an autosomal dominant
disorder manifesting as Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (150600).

.0044
AVASCULAR NECROSIS OF THE FEMORAL HEAD, PRIMARY
COL2A1, GLY717SER

In a family with autosomal dominant avascular necrosis of the femoral
head (608805), Liu et al. (2005) identified a G-to-A transition in exon
33 of the COL2A1 gene, causing a glycine-to-serine change at codon 717
(G717S).

.0045
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I
RHEGMATOGENOUS RETINAL DETACHMENT, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, INCLUDED
COL2A1, ARG453TER

In a patient with sporadic Stickler syndrome (108300), Wilkin et al.
(2000) identified a C-to-T transition in the COL2A1 gene, resulting in
an arg453-to-ter (R453X) substitution. The patient had cleft palate,
sensorineural hearing loss, joint laxity, high myopia, vitreoretinal
degeneration, and retinal breaks and detachments.

In affected members of a family with no systemic characteristics of
Stickler syndrome but dominantly inherited rhegmatogenous retinal
detachment or retinal tears (609508), Go et al. (2003) identified the
R453X mutation, which they noted was in exon 30 (Wilkin et al. (2000)
had placed the mutation in exon 28). They noted that previously reported
predominantly ocular Stickler syndrome cases had been associated with
protein-truncating mutations in exon 2, an exon subject to alternative
splicing.

.0046
RHEGMATOGENOUS RETINAL DETACHMENT, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
COL2A1, GLY118ARG

In affected members of a family with dominantly inherited rhegmatogenous
retinal detachment (609508) and no systemic clinical signs (skeletal,
orofacial, or auditory) usually associated with Stickler syndrome
(108300), Richards et al. (2005) identified a 10838G-A transition in
exon 15 of the COL2A1 gene, resulting in a gly118-to-arg (G118R)
substitution.

.0047
SPONDYLOEPIMETAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, STRUDWICK TYPE
COL2A1, ARG792GLY

In monozygotic twin girls with SEMD Strudwick (184250), Sulko et al.
(2005) identified heterozygosity for a 79A-G transition in exon 41 of
the COL2A1 gene, resulting in an arg792-to-gly (R792G) substitution. The
mutation was not detected in the unaffected parents or in 90 controls.

.0048
OTOSPONDYLOMEGAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA
COL2A1, IVS10AS, A-G, -2

In a 22-year-old Japanese female with otospondylomegaepiphyseal
dysplasia (OSMED; 215150), Miyamoto et al. (2005) identified a novel
COL2A1 mutation at a splice acceptor site within intron 10 (709-2A-G).
This mutation caused a skipping of exon 11, and of exons 11 and 13.
These exon-skipping events were presumed to cause an in-frame deletion
of the triple helical region of the COL2A1 product. Mutations in the
COL11A2 gene (120290) had been reported as a cause for OSMED. The report
confirmed the overlap between type II and type XI collagenopathies.

.0049
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I, NONSYNDROMIC OCULAR
COL2A1, IVS51DS, T-C, +2

In a family with the predominantly ocular form of type I Stickler
syndrome (609508), Richards et al. (2006) found that the donor splice
site of intron 51 showed a change from GT to GC. Using splicing reporter
constructs, they demonstrated that normal transcripts could be produced
from this mutant allele. Some GC donor splice sites exist naturally in
the human genome (Thanaraj and Clark, 2001). Whether there is a
difference in the efficiency of normal splicing from the mutant GC
allele between cartilage and ocular tissue was unknown. However,
Richards et al. (2006) observed that not all cells transfected with the
mutant minigene were capable of normal processing of the mutant mRNA, so
tissue-specific missplicing may be one explanation for the predominantly
ocular phenotype in this family. An alternative explanation is that
vitreous development (which is rapid, with the secondary vitreous
complete by 12 weeks' gestation) is more susceptible to a reduction in
the level of type II collagen than is cartilage development, in which
the extracellular matrix has longer to develop.

.0050
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I, NONSYNDROMIC OCULAR
COL2A1, TRP47TER

In a family with the predominantly ocular form of Stickler syndrome type
I (609508), Richards et al. (2006) found a nonsense mutation, trp47 to
ter (W47X), resulting from a 141G-A transition in exon 2 of the COL2A1
gene. They observed 2 other examples of predominantly ocular Stickler
syndrome due to mutations in the alternatively spliced exon 2. One other
mutation causing this phenotype was located at the donor splice site of
IVS51 (120140.0049).

.0051
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I, NONSYNDROMIC OCULAR
COL2A1, CYS64TER

In 2 unrelated patients with nonsyndromic ocular Stickler syndrome
(609508), McAlinden et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 192C-A
transversion in exon 2 of the COL2A1 gene, resulting in a cys64-to-ter
(C64X) substitution. In vitro studies using a minigene construct
indicated that the C64X, C57Y (120140.0052), and W47X (120140.0050)
mutations resulted in a splicing pattern change and a decreased ratio of
IIA:IIB mRNA. The findings suggested that the mutations were present in
functional cis regulatory elements in exon 2 that are important in
regulating the mechanism of alternative splicing of this exon. McAlinden
et al. (2008) postulated that the mutations did not result in
nonsense-mediated decay and haploinsufficiency, but rather an altered
mRNA splice ratio with effects limited to the eye. Absence of an
extraocular phenotype in Stickler syndrome patients with mutations in
exon 2 of COL2A1 may be due to sufficient production of isoform IIB by
nonsense-mediated altered splicing. Since isoform IIA is expressed in
adult ocular vitreous, the ocular phenotype may be due to inadequate
amounts of isoform IIA in the mature eye.

.0052
STICKLER SYNDROME, TYPE I, NONSYNDROMIC OCULAR
COL2A1, CYS57TYR

In a patient with nonsyndromic ocular Stickler syndrome (609508),
McAlinden et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 170G-A transition in
exon 2 of the COL2A1 gene, resulting in a cys57-to-tyr (C57Y)
substitution.

.0053
ACHONDROGENESIS, TYPE II
COL2A1, GLY346VAL

In 3 fetuses with lethal achondrogenesis type II (200610) born to a
healthy, nonconsanguineous young couple, Forzano et al. (2007)
identified heterozygosity for a 1037G-T transversion in exon 3 of the
COL2A1 gene resulting in a gly346-to-val (G346V) substitution. An
earlier born fetus had also had achondrogenesis type II. The father's
blood DNA harbored a low mutation signal consistent with mosaicism.
Additional DNA analyses of the father's fibroblasts, hair roots, buccal
smear, and urine revealed weak mosaicism in all tissues. Forzano et al.
(2007) stated that this was the first case of proven somatic mosaicism
for a COL2A1 mutation that led to a lethal skeletal dysplasia in 4
offspring.

.0054
AVASCULAR NECROSIS OF THE FEMORAL HEAD, PRIMARY
COL2A1, THR1383MET

In a 40-year-old man who was diagnosed with avascular necrosis of the
femoral head (608805) at 18 years of age, Kannu et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 4148C-T transition in exon 51 of the COL2A1 gene,
resulting in a thr1383-to-met (T1383M) substitution within the highly
conserved C-propeptide region. The mutation was not found in unaffected
family members or 150 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched controls. The
patient had a normal skeletal survey, other than bilateral hip
degeneration; he had no facial dysmorphism, and ophthalmologic and
audiologic examinations were normal.

142600	TITLE *142600 HEXOKINASE 1; HK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) catalyzes the first step in glucose metabolism,
using ATP for the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate.
Four different forms of hexokinase, designated type HK1, HK2 (601125),
HK3 (142570), and HK4 (138079), encoded by different genes, are present
in mammalian tissues. Among these, HK1 is the predominant glucose
phosphorylating activity in those tissues that share a strict dependence
on glucose utilization for their physiologic functions, such as brain,
erythrocytes, platelets, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts (summary by
Bianchi et al., 1997). Different isoforms of HK1 are either cytoplasmic
or associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) through a
5-prime porin (VDAC1; 604492)-binding domain (Murakami and Piomelli,
1997).

CLONING

Nishi et al. (1988) analyzed cDNA clones encoding human hexokinase
isolated from an adult kidney library. Analysis of this 917-amino acid
protein showed that the sequences of the N- and C-terminal halves,
corresponding to the regulatory and catalytic domains, respectively, are
homologous. Eukaryotic hexokinases evolved from duplication of a gene
encoding a protein of about 450 amino acids. Griffin et al. (1991)
thought that comparisons of sequences in many species supported the
theory of Ureta (1982) that the mammalian hexokinases arose from the
duplication and fusion of an ancestral protoenzyme and that the yeast
and mammalian glucokinases arose twice in evolution. Sequence analysis
demonstrated that a 15-amino acid porin-binding domain in the N terminus
of HK1 is absolutely conserved and mediates the binding of HK1 to the
mitochondria. In the course of their work, Griffin et al. (1991)
developed a method for cloning the cDNA for a low abundance protein
using knowledge of the evolutionary conservation of amino acid and
nucleotide sequence.

By liquid chromatography, Murakami et al. (1990) identified 2 distinct
major isozymes of human red blood cell (RBC) hexokinase. One had a
molecular mass similar to that of HK1 identified in liver, and the
other, designated HKR, was larger than HK1 by several kilodaltons. RBC
from normal blood contained HK1 and HKR at an equal activity, but in
reticulocyte-rich RBC, HKR dominated. Murakami and Piomelli (1997)
isolated a cDNA clone for the red cell-specific HK isozyme HKR. Its
nucleotide sequence was identical to HK1 cDNA except for the 5-prime
end. It lacks the first 62 nucleotides of the HK1 coding region;
instead, it contains a unique sequence of 60 nucleotides at the
beginning of the coding sequence as well as another unique sequence
upstream of the putative translation initiation site. It lacks the
porin-binding domain that facilitates binding to mitochondria, thus
explaining the exclusive cytoplasmic localization of red blood cell HK.
Northern blot analysis showed that it was expressed in reticulocytes and
in an erythroleukemic cell line, but not in a lymphocytic cell line.

Mori et al. (1996) reported the cloning of cDNAs representing 3 unique
human type 1 hexokinase mRNAs expressed in testis, which were not
detected by Northern blot analysis in other human tissues. These mRNAs
contained unique sequences in the 5-prime terminus and lacked the
porin-binding domain (PBD), a conserved sequence that mediates the
binding of hexokinase to the mitochondria. The sequences were similar to
those identified by Mori et al. (1993) in mouse testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ruzzo et al. (1998) determined that the HK1 gene contains 18 exons and
spans about 75 kb. Analysis of the 5-prime flanking region revealed
binding sites for AP1 and CRE as well as several binding sites for SP1.
Ruzzo et al. (1998) identified an exon 1 specific to HK1 expressed in
somatic cells; an alternative exon (exon 1R) transcribed in red blood
cells replaced the somatic exon 1 by alternative splicing. Exon 1R lacks
the porin-binding domain.

Andreoni et al. (2000) found that multiple testis-specific HK1
transcripts are encoded by 6 different exons; 5 of the exons are located
upstream from the somatic exon 1, and one is located within intron 1.
With identification of these additional exons, they determined that the
gene spans at least 100 kb.

MAPPING

Shows (1974) presented evidence from somatic cell hybrid experiments
that hexokinase and cytoplasmic glutamate oxaloacetic transaminase are
syntenic on chromosome 10. By gene dosage studies of fibroblasts,
Gitelman and Simpson (1982) mapped HK1 to 10p11-q23. By dosage effect,
Dallapiccola et al. (1981) narrowed the HK1 assignment to 10pter-p13.
Dallapiccola et al. (1984) determined HK1 activity in the red cells of 5
patients with various partial duplications of 10p and concluded that the
most likely regional assignment for HK1 is 10p11.2. By in situ
hybridization, Shows et al. (1989) regionalized the HK1 gene to 10q22.
Daniele et al. (1992) used an HK1 cDNA as a probe for the study of a
panel of human-hamster somatic cell hybrids to assign the gene to the
long arm of chromosome 10 in the region q11.2-qter. This result agrees
with those reported by Gitelman and Simpson (1982) and Shows et al.
(1989) but conflicts with that reported by Dallapiccola et al. (1984).
Daniele et al. (1992) acknowledged the possibility that the HK1 probe
they used recognized more than a single locus but concluded that if 2 or
more HK loci exist they are all located on chromosome 10. Gelb et al.
(1992) demonstrated that most of the coding region of the HK1 gene is
located in a 120-kb YAC, which mapped entirely to chromosome 10.

The genes for 3 separate hexokinases have been assigned to specific
sites as of 1997: HK1, a red-cell isoform, to chromosome 10; HK2
(601125), the major hexokinase expressed in skeletal muscle, to
chromosome 2; and HK3 (142570), an isoform in white blood cells, to
chromosome 5. Hexokinase-4 (HK4) is glucokinase (GCK; 138079), which
maps to chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Nonspherocytic Hemolytic Anemia Due to Hexokinase Deficiency

Bianchi and Magnani (1995) reported the molecular characterization of
the defect in HK1 in a patient with hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase
deficiency (235700). PCR amplification and sequence of the cDNA revealed
compound heterozygosity for a deletion and a single nucleotide
substitution. The 96-bp deletion (142600.0001) involved nucleotides 577
to 672 of their cDNA sequence and was found in the cDNA of none of 14
unrelated normal subjects. The sequence of the HK1 allele without
deletion showed a T-to-C transition of nucleotide 1677, which caused the
amino acid change leu529-to-ser (142600.0002). The substitution was not
found in 10 normal controls. Bianchi and Magnani (1995) stated that to
their knowledge only 14 cases had been described, 2 of which had been
studied in their laboratory: HK-Melzo and HK-Napoli. It was in HK-Melzo
that the molecular defect was demonstrated. They showed that in the
HK-Melzo variant, the HK deficiency was expressed not only in
erythrocytes but also in platelets, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts. All
these types of cells contain HK type I as the predominant glucose
phosphorylating enzyme and, in particular, platelets and erythrocytes
share a strict dependence upon glucose utilization for their physiologic
functions.

In a girl, born of consanguineous parents, with severe nonspherocytic
hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency previously reported by
Rijksen et al. (1983), van Wijk et al. (2003) identified a homozygous
mutation in the HK1 gene (T680S; 142600.0004). The mutation, which
segregated with the disorder in the family and was not found in 50
controls, was designated 'Utrecht.' In vitro studies of the mutant
enzyme showed that it had a 2-fold decrease in affinity for Mg-ATP2 and
a markedly decreased affinity for the inhibitor glucose-1,6-diphosphate.
Patient red cells and platelets had about 25% residual activity.

- Russe Type of Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy

In all 34 European Gypsy individuals with the Russe type of hereditary
motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSNR; 605285) who were studied, Hantke et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous sequence change in the HK1 gene
(142600.0003) that mapped within the candidate disease interval on
chromosome 10q. The mutation was located at a highly conserved
nucleotide in the putative AltT2 exon located in the 5-prime region
upstream of HK1. The variant was found in heterozygous state in 5 of 790
control individuals representing a cross-section of the Gypsy
population, but not in 233 Bulgarian controls. AltT2-containing
transcripts in the mouse peripheral nerve were rare compared to the
coding region of HK1. However, 6 of 8 testis AltT2-containing isoforms
were found, with expression patterns differing between the peripheral
nerve and the brain and between newborn and adult tissues in mice. There
was no difference in HK1 mRNA in Schwann cells derived from patients or
controls, and patient cells showed no evidence of HK1 enzyme activity
compared to controls. Bioinformatic tools did not suggest an effect of
the variant on HK1 gene splicing or binding sites for interacting
proteins. However, there was evidence that the variant may cause a
ter-to-tyr substitution in 1 upstream open reading frame that had a
non-AUG start codon, which could potentially disrupt HK1 translation
regulation. Hantke et al. (2009) speculated that non-OMM-binding HK1 may
play a role in the pathogenesis of HMSNR.

Sevilla et al. (2013) found that 11 patients from 9 Roma Gypsy families
were homozygous for the HK1 variant (g.9712G-C; 142600.0003) identified
by Hantke et al. (2009), and haplotype analysis confirmed a founder
effect in this population.

In the so-called HK-Melzo variant of hexokinase deficiency (235700),
Bianchi and Magnani (1995) demonstrated compound heterozygosity for
deletion of nucleotides 577 to 672 in the HK cDNA sequence and a

NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY MOTOR AND SENSORY, RUSSE TYPE
HK1, -3818-195G-C, AltT2 EXON

In all 34 individuals with the Russe type of hereditary motor and
sensory neuropathy (HMSNR; 605285) who were studied, Hantke et al.
(2009) identified 2 homozygous sequence changes in the HK1 gene, which
maps within the candidate disease interval on chromosome 10q. One was a
G-to-C transversion at a highly conserved nucleotide in the putative
AltT2 exon located in the 5-prime region upstream of HK1 (-3818-195G-C,
NM_033497; Chandler, 2013), and the other was an intronic G-to-A
transition downstream of the AltT2 change; the G-to-A transition was not
highly conserved, and thus not thought to be pathogenic. These 2
variants were found in heterozygous state in 5 of 790 control
individuals representing a cross-section of the Gypsy population, but
not in 233 Bulgarian controls. AltT2-containing transcripts in the mouse
peripheral nerve were rare compared to the coding region of HK1.
However, 6 of 8 testis AltT2-containing isoforms were found, with
expression patterns differing between the peripheral nerve and the brain
and between newborn and adult tissues in mice. There was no difference
in HK1 mRNA in Schwann cells derived from patients or controls, and
patient cells showed no evidence of HK1 enzyme activity compared to
controls. Bioinformatic tools did not suggest an effect of the G-C
change on HK1 gene splicing or binding sites for interacting proteins.
However, there was evidence that the G-C change may cause a ter-to-tyr
substitution in 1 upstream open reading frame that had a non-AUG start
codon, which could potentially disrupt HK1 translation regulation.
Hantke et al. (2009) speculated that non-OMM-binding HK1 may play a role
in the pathogenesis of HMSNR.

Sevilla et al. (2013) found that 11 patients from 9 Roma Gypsy families
with progressive hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy were homozygous
for the HK1 variant (g.9712G-C) identified by Hantke et al. (2009), and
haplotype analysis confirmed a founder effect in this population. The
founding ancestor was estimated to have lived at the end of the 18th
century, when a population split occurred from a tribal group and the
Gypsy population in Spain increased under the rule of Charles III.

HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, NONSPHEROCYTIC, DUE TO HEXOKINASE DEFICIENCY
HK1, THR680SER

In a girl, born of consanguineous parents, with severe nonspherocytic
hemolytic anemia due to hexokinase deficiency (235700) previously
reported by Rijksen et al. (1983), van Wijk et al. (2003) identified a
homozygous c.2039C-G transversion in exon 15 of the HK1 gene, resulting
in a thr680-to-ser (T680S) substitution at a highly conserved residue in
the active site. The mutation, which segregated with the disorder in the
family and was not found in 50 controls, was designated 'Utrecht.' In
vitro studies of the mutant enzyme showed that it had a 2-fold decrease
in affinity for Mg-ATP2 and a markedly decreased affinity for the
inhibitor glucose-1,6-diphosphate.

;;ALPHA-GLOBIN TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR CP2;;
LATE SV40 FACTOR; LSF

LBP1D, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Swendeman et al. (1994) characterized the genomic structure, chromosome
location, promoter, and expression pattern of CP2, a 66-kD cellular
transcription factor that interacts with the alpha-globin (141800)
promoter as well as with additional cellular and viral promoter
elements. Homodimers of CP2, together with a 45-kD partner protein, form
the so-called stage selector protein complex (Jane et al., 1995) that
binds to a proximal gamma-globin gene promoter regulatory sequence,
termed the stage selector element (SSE). The SSE is thought to be
involved in silencing beta globin gene (141900) transcription during
fetal erythropoiesis (Cunningham et al., 1995).

LBP1 is a cellular protein that binds strongly to sequences around the
human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) initiation site and weakly over
the TATA box. By PCR using primers designed from LBP1 purified from HeLa
cell extracts, Yoon et al. (1994) obtained 4 LBP1 cDNAs, which they
termed LBP1A, LBP1B, LBP1C, and LBP1D. LBP1A and LBP1B are splice
variants of UBP1 (609784), and LBP1C and LBP1D are splice variants of
TFCP2. The deduced LBP1C and LBP1D proteins contain 502 and 451 amino
acids, respectively. In vitro translation resulted in proteins with
apparent molecular masses of 64 and 58 kD, respectively. LBP1D lacks
part of a putative N-terminal DNA-binding domain found in LBP1C. LBP1C
shares 72% amino acid identity with LBP1A, with highest identity in the
N-terminal halves.

GENE FUNCTION

Yoon et al. (1994) found that LBP1C bound to the HIV-1 promoter in a
sequence-specific fashion, but LBP1D did not. LBP1C could activate
transcription from a promoter containing an LBP1-binding site. Both
LBP1C and LBP1D could bind the UBP1 isoforms LBP1A and LBP1B and form
heteromeric complexes. However, LBP1D inhibited the binding of the other
LBPs to the LBP1 recognition site on DNA.

By cDNA microarray, Western blot analysis, and luciferase reporter
assay, Yoo et al. (2009) found significant upregulation of LSF and LSF
transcriptional activity in the nuclei of hepatocellular carcinoma cells
(HCC; 114550) expressing AEG1 (MTDH: 610323) compared to those without
AEG1 expression. The increase in LSF activity correlated with
significant increases in the downstream targets thymidylate synthetase
(TYMS; 188350) during the growth cycle and dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase (DPYD; 612779). The AEG1-transfected HCC cells showed more
resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment compared to those without
AEG1 expression, which could be explained by the upregulation of both
TYMS and DPYD. Studies with siRNA targeting AEG1, LSF, or DPYD abrogated
the 5-FU resistance. In nude xenograft mice transfected with an HCC cell
line that expressed AEG1 and showed resistance to 5-FU, inhibition of
AEG1 resulted in significant inhibition in tumor growth, and a
combination of 5-FU and AEG1 inhibition resulted in an additive effect
on tumor growth inhibition. The findings demonstrated that AEG1 confers
resistance to 5-FU by inducing the expression of LSF and DPYD, and
pointed to a central role of AEG1 in HCC development and progression.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Yoo et al. (2010) found that nuclear
expression of LSF was upregulated in human HCC samples compared with
normal liver. FISH suggested that elevated LSF expression was due to
chromosome 12 polysomy in several HCC samples. Overexpression of LSF in
HepG3 cells increased cell proliferation, colony forming ability, and
anchorage-independent growth in soft agar in culture, and it increased
tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo in mice. Overexpression of a
dominant-negative LSF mutant abrogated these effects. Gene expression
profiling revealed significant induction of osteopontin (OPN, or SPP1;
166490), a gene important in tumor metastasis. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis and reporter gene assays confirmed that LSF
bound and activated the OPN promoter. Yoo et al. (2010) concluded that,
by regulating OPN expression, LSF functions as a key regulator of HCC
development and progression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Swendeman et al. (1994) found that the murine and human TFCP2 genes
contain 16 and 15 exons, respectively. Both genes span approximately 30
kb of chromosomal DNA, and among coding exons, all exon/intron
boundaries are conserved.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Swendeman et al. (1994) showed that
the human TFCP2 gene resides on chromosome 12, while interspecific
backcross analysis demonstrated that the murine gene maps to the distal
end of chromosome 15 in a region syntenic with human chromosome 12. The
murine and human promoters initiated mRNAs at multiple start sites in a
conserved region that spanned more than 450 nucleotides.

Cunningham et al. (1995) mapped the TFCP2 gene to 12q13 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization and within 250 kb of NFE2 (601490), another
erythroid-specific transcription factor which binds to sequences in the
beta-globin locus control region (152424).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lambert et al. (2000) reported an association between a noncoding
polymorphism (G-A) in the 3-prime untranslated region of TFCP2 and
sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD5; 602096) in French and British
populations and a similar trend in a North American population. The
combined analysis of the 3 independent populations suggested a
protective effect of the A allele (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.75). The A
allele demonstrated reduced binding to nuclear protein(s) from a
neuroblastoma cell line, and absence of the A allele was associated with
lower gene expression in lymphocytes from AD cases compared with
controls. The authors suggested that polymorphic variation in TFCP2 may
be important for the pathogenesis of AD, particularly since the gene
product interacts with proteins such as GSK3B (605004), Fe65 (602709),
and certain factors involved in the inflammatory response.

Taylor et al. (2001) reported an analysis of 216 necropsy-confirmed
Alzheimer disease cases and 301 nondemented controls greater than 73
years. The frequency of the A allele of the TFCP2 gene was reduced in
the Alzheimer disease cases compared to the controls (odds ratio = 0.59,
95% CI, 0.35-1.00). However, the genotype frequencies of the Alzheimer
disease cases when compared to controls were not significantly
different. No significant effects were found when the data were adjusted
for age, sex, or the presence of the apoE4 allele (107741.0016).

191523	TITLE *191523 UPSTREAM STIMULATORY FACTOR 1; USF1
;;MAJOR LATE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; MLTF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Upstream stimulatory factor (USF) is a ubiquitously expressed cellular
transcription factor. Purified USF consists of 2 related polypeptides,
USF1, of 43 kD, and USF2 (600390), of 44 kD. USF1 belongs to the MYC
(190080) family of DNA-binding proteins (Gregor et al., 1990; Viollet et
al., 1996).

CLONING

Gregor et al. (1990) cloned USF1 by microsequence analysis of purified
USF protein. USF1 contains a C-terminal DNA-binding domain that includes
a helix-loop-helix motif and a leucine repeat. Gregor et al. (1990) also
identified alternatively spliced USF1 variants.

Sirito et al. (1994) cloned mouse Usf1. Northern blot analysis detected
Usf1 expression in all mouse tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Gregor et al. (1990) found that USF1 interacted with its target DNA as a
dimer. The leucine repeat of USF1 was required for efficient DNA binding
and USF1 dimerization, but the isolated helix-loop-helix domain also
bound DNA.

Sirito et al. (1994) found that mouse Usf1 and Usf2 had similar DNA
binding properties.

Viollet et al. (1996) found that USF1/USF2a heterodimers represented
more than 66% of the USF-binding activity in vivo, whereas USF1 and
USF2a homodimers represented less that 10%. USF1/USF2b heterodimers
accounted for almost 15% of the USF species in some cell lines. The
preferential heterodimerization of USF subunits was reproduced ex vivo,
but in vitro cotranslated subunits or recombinant USF proteins dimerized
randomly. In transiently transfected HeLa or hepatoma cells, USF2a and
USF1 homodimers transactivated a minimal promoter with similar
efficiency, whereas USF2b was a poor transactivator of the minimal
promoter. USF1, USF2a, and USF2b homodimers were equally efficient in
transactivating the liver-specific pyruvate kinase gene (609712)
promoter.

By transfection experiments, Roy et al. (1997) found that USF1 can act
synergistically with GTF2I (601679) to activate transcription through
both pyrimidine-rich initiator (Inr) elements and E-box elements of the
adenovirus major late promoter. By mutation analysis, they determined
that this synergistic action requires both the activation and
dimerization domains of USF1. By in vitro cotranslation followed by
coimmunoprecipitation studies, they confirmed direct protein interaction
between GTF2I and USF1.

Iynedjian (1998) demonstrated that mammalian USF1 activated reporter
gene expression from the E box within the promoter of the liver-specific
glucokinase gene (GCK; 138079). Expression of a truncated form of USF1
lacking the transcription activation domain and the basic region
decreased reporter activity by a dominant-negative effect.

Hosts and pathogens evolve various responses for controlling infection
and evading destruction, respectively. Using column chromatography,
Zhong et al. (2001) identified a factor in Chlamydia trachomatis, the
causative organism of trachoma and chronic urogenital infection, that
degrades the transcription factors RFX5 (601863) and USF1. The
degradation of these host factors correlates with the suppression of MHC
class I and class II antigen expression in infected cells, thereby
suppressing the host immune response.

Resting human lymphocytes do not have telomerase activity, but
activation by a variety of stimuli induces TERT (187270) expression and
telomerase activity. Yago et al. (2002) found that activated human T and
B lymphocytes expressed USF1 and the full-length isoform of USF2, and
that dimers of these proteins bound E boxes in the TERT promoter and
activated TERT expression. In contrast, resting human T and B
lymphocytes expressed both the N-terminally truncated isoform of USF2
and full-length USF2, and the truncated isoform had a dominant-negative
effect on TERT expression induced by full-length USF2.

MAPPING

Shieh et al. (1993) assigned the USF1 gene to 1q22-q23 by study of
mouse/human somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization. With the
isolation of the Usf1 cDNA in the mouse by RT-PCR, Henrion et al. (1995)
could use isotopic in situ hybridization to map the gene to bands 1H and
11C-E in the mouse. Since chromosome 1 of the mouse is homologous to the
region of human chromosome 1 where USF1 is located, Henrion et al.
(1995) suggested that the sequence on chromosome 11 is a pseudogene or a
related gene. In the mouse, Steingrimsson et al. (1995) mapped this and
4 other bHLH-ZIP transcription factors by interspecific backcross
analysis. Usf1 had previously been mapped to mouse chromosome 1 by in
situ hybridization, but its position on the meiotic linkage map had not
been determined. Its location was consistent with the location of the
human gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pajukanta et al. (2004) showed that familial combined hyperlipidemia
(FCHL1; 602491) was linked and associated with the USF1 gene in 60
extended Finnish families, including 721 genotyped individuals (p =
0.00002), especially in males with high triglycerides (p = 0.0000009).
They identified several SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium and a
common SNP haplotype defining the disease-associated USF1 allele. They
also identified a new putative regulatory element in USF1 flanking the
susceptibility haplotype.

Shoulders (2004) diagrammed a theoretical scenario whereby the use of a
putative promoter in intron 7 of USF1 might lead to the generation of a
mini-USF1 protein lacking the transactivation domain. Because mini-USF
proteins in vitro behave as transdominant inhibitors
(Lefrancois-Martinez et al., 1995; Viollet et al., 1996), whether the
putative promoter identified by Pajukanta et al. (2004) might operate in
vivo to downregulate USF1 activity should be established.

USF1 is a transcription factor controlling expression of several genes
involved in lipid and glucose homeostasis and colocalizes with FCHL and
type 2 diabetes (see 125853) on chromosome 1q22-q23. Putt et al. (2004)
identified 3 common polymorphisms in USF1 and examined their association
with fasting and postprandial lipids and with response to an oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in the European Atherosclerosis Research
Study II offspring study. In haplotype analysis, 475C/1748T showed
significantly higher and 475T/1748T showed lower peak glucose during the
OGTT. There was significant case-control heterogeneity in the
interaction of genotype with body mass index (BMI) and fasting low
density lipoprotein (LDL) with 306A-G and 1748C-T, respectively. The
interaction of BMI and 475C-T on fasting glucose levels achieved
case-control heterogeneity of borderline significance. Furthermore,
475C-T showed interaction with polymorphisms in both hormone-sensitive
lipase (HSL; 151750) and APOC3 (107720) on area under the curve (AUC)
triglycerides and plasma apoE levels, respectively. Putt et al. (2004)
concluded that in these healthy young men, variation in USF1 was the
influencing feature of both glucose and lipid homeostasis, showing
case-control heterogeneity.

Coon et al. (2005) reported an association between the 2 USF1 SNPs
identified by Pajukanta et al. (2004) and FCHL, LDL cholesterol, and
triglycerides in a large sample of 2,195 individuals from 87 Utah
pedigrees. The pedigrees were ascertained for traits related to FCHL,
including early death due to coronary heart disease, early strokes, or
early-onset hypertension.

ANIMAL MODEL

By analyzing the glucose responsiveness of Usf knockout mice, Vallet et
al. (1998) determined that normal responsiveness required either
Usf1/Usf2 heterodimers or Usf2 homodimers, even in mice with total Usf
binding activity reduced by half. Usf1 homodimers gave rise to delayed
glucose responsiveness.

Casado et al. (1999) stated that the E box within the FASN (600212)
promoter is regulated by USF1, USF2, and SREBP1 (184756). They analyzed
the glucose responsiveness of hepatic Fasn gene expression in Usf1 and
Usf2 knockout mice and found that in both types of mutant mice,
induction of the Fasn gene by refeeding a carbohydrate-rich diet was
severely delayed. In contrast, expression of Srebp1 was almost normal,
and insulin response was unchanged. Casado et al. (1999) concluded that
the USF transactivators, and especially USF1/USF2 heterodimers, are
essential to sustain the dietary induction of the FASN gene in liver.

Wu et al. (2010) reported that overexpression of human USF1 in both
transgenic mice and mice with transient liver-specific overexpression
influenced metabolic trait phenotypes, including obesity, total
cholesterol level, LDL and VLDL cholesterol level, and glucose/insulin
ratio. Additional analyses of trait and hepatic gene expression data
from an F2 population derived from C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ strains in which
there is a naturally occurring variation in Usf1 expression supported a
causal role for Usf1 for relevant metabolic traits. Gene network and
pathway analyses of the liver gene expression signatures in the F2
population and the hepatic overexpression model suggested the
involvement of Usf1 in immune responses and metabolism, including an
Igfbp2 (146731)-centered module. In all 3 mouse model settings, notable
sex specificity was observed, consistent with human studies showing
differences in association with USF1 gene polymorphisms between sexes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPERLIPIDEMIA, FAMILIAL COMBINED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
USF1, USF1S1

Pajukanta et al. (2004) identified 2 SNPs of the USF1 gene, usf1s1
(dbSNP rs3737787) and usf1s2 (191523.0002), that were associated with
familial combined hyperlipidemia mapping to a locus on 1q21-q23
(602491). The usf1s1 SNP is located in the 3-prime untranslated region
(Naukkarinen et al., 2005). The common alleles (1-1) of the 2 SNPs
define an at-risk haplotype. Allelic associations of the at-risk
haplotype were found with triglycerides, apoB (107730), total
cholesterol, and LDL peak particle size, supporting the concept that
USF1 affects the complex lipid phenotype of FCHL and not only 1 lipid
trait.

.0002
HYPERLIPIDEMIA, FAMILIAL COMBINED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
USF1, USF1S2

The usf1s2 SNP (dbSNP rs2073658) is located in intron 7; see 191523.0001
and Pajukanta et al. (2004).

Naukkarinen et al. (2005) identified a 20-bp DNA sequence in intron 7 of
the USF1 gene, containing dbSNP rs2073658, that bound nuclear proteins
and likely represented a transcriptional regulatory element. This
functional role was further supported by the differential expression of
USF1-regulated genes in fat biopsy between individuals carrying
different allelic variants of USF1. Apolipoprotein E (APOE; 107741) was
the most downregulated gene in the at-risk individuals, linking the
potential risk alleles of USF1 with the impaired APOE-dependent
catabolism of atherogenic lipoprotein particles.

603957	TITLE *603957 FLAVIN-CONTAINING MONOOXYGENASE 5; FMO5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The flavin-containing monooxygenases (EC 1.14.13.8) catalyze the
oxidation of nucleophilic nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms in a
wide variety of compounds, including many pesticides and drugs (Phillips
et al., 1995).

CLONING

By screening liver cDNA libraries with rabbit FMO5 as probe, Overby et
al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding guinea pig and human FMO5. The
predicted 533-amino acid human protein shares 85% and 87% sequence
identity with rabbit and guinea pig FMO5, respectively. Northern blot
analysis revealed that the human FMO5 gene is expressed as 2.6- and
3.8-kb mRNAs in liver. The FMO5 protein had an apparent molecular mass
of 60 kD on Western blots of adult and neonatal human liver.

Phillips et al. (1995) cloned human FMO5 by screening adult human
placenta and liver cDNA libraries with the rabbit coding sequence. The
deduced protein is between 51 and 56% identical to the 4 previously
identified human FMO proteins and shares the highest sequence identity
with FMO2 (603955).

GENE FUNCTION

Overby et al. (1995) found that the rabbit, guinea pig, and human FMO5
enzymes exhibited similar catalytic activities, which were distinct from
those of other FMOs. The authors concluded that FMO5 is not an efficient
drug-metabolizing enzyme and that it may have an alternative physiologic
role.

Miller et al. (1997) demonstrated that FMO5 transcripts are
progesterone-regulated in breast cancer cells specifically under the
control of the progesterone receptor B-isoform (PRB; 607311). Because
FMOs are involved in the metabolic activation of drugs and xenobiotic
compounds, including tamoxifen, the authors speculated that progesterone
may enhance the carcinogenicity of tamoxifen in target tissues that
overexpress PRB by upregulating FMO5.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrids, McCombie et al. (1996) mapped
the FMO2 (603955) and FMO5 genes to chromosome 1q, where 3 other human
FMO genes are located. Using sequence analysis of a YAC contig, Gelb et
al. (1997) found that the FMO5 gene is located between the NPR1 (108960)
and CX40 (GJA5; 121013) genes. By FISH, they mapped this contig to
1q21.1. Gelb et al. (1997) noted that since the FMO1 gene maps to
1q23-q25, this excluded the possibility that a single gene cluster
contains the entire FMO family.

609061	TITLE *609061 ENABLED, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; ENAH
;;ENA;;
MAMMALIAN ENABLED; MENA;;
NDPP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sazuka et al. (1992) cloned mouse Enah, which they called Ndpp1. The
3-prime UTR contains 7 ATTTA mRNA destabilization motifs. The deduced
389-amino acid protein has a proline-rich N terminus, followed by a
leucine/proline-rich region, a 4-arginine cluster near a possible alpha
helix, and a second possible alpha helix at the C terminus. Enah also
has 3 putative N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected a
number of mRNA species that were downregulated during mouse embryonic
development and were only faintly detected in adult mouse brain.
Southern blot analysis of RT-PCR products found Enah expressed in
several adult mouse tissues, with highest expression in heart and
testis. Southern blot analysis detected homologs of mouse Enah in
several vertebrate species, including human.

Tani et al. (2003) cloned full-length mouse Enah, which they called
Mena, and a shorter splice variant, which they called Mena(S). The
full-length Mena cDNA encodes a deduced 541-amino acid protein
containing an N-terminal Ena/VASP (601703) homology-1 (EVH1) domain, an
arg-leu-glu-rich region, a pro-rich profilin (176610)-binding motif, and
a C-terminal EVH2 domain. The Mena(S) cDNA encodes a deduced 508-amino
acid protein that lacks a portion of the profilin-binding motif.
Immunofluorescence microscopy localized Mena at focal contacts and the
leading edge of mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

By database analysis and PCR and 5-prime RACE of adult and fetal brain
and fibroblast cDNA libraries, Urbanelli et al. (2006) cloned
full-length human ENAH. The deduced 570-amino acid ENAH protein shares
86.6% identity with mouse Enah. Human ENAH has N- and C-terminal EVH
domains separated by a LERER repeat region and a proline-rich region. It
also has potential phosphorylation sites and 2 short amino acid
stretches located in an arg-leu-glu-rich region that are not found in
mouse Enah. The LERER repeats are predicted to form an extended helix
with alternating charges. Northern blot analysis detected a major
transcript of about 4.8 kb in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in skeletal muscle, pancreas, and placenta, and lowest
expression in brain. A smaller transcript was also detected in skeletal
muscle. RT-PCR detected an ENAH splice variant homologous to the mouse
Enah(S) variant in a human glioblastoma cell line and 3 ENAH splice
variants homologous to 3 mouse neural-specific Enah variants in a human
neuroblastoma cell line.

GENE FUNCTION

By pull-down from mouse brain lysates and coimmunoprecipitation of COS
cells overexpressing rat Fe65 (APBB1; 602709), Ermekova et al. (1997)
determined that the WW domain of rat Fe65 interacted with the
polyproline-rich region of mouse Mena.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Tani et al. (2003) found that human ABI1
(SSH3BP1; 603050) bound mouse Mena. Binding analysis revealed that the
EVH1 domain of Mena bound a polyproline structure of ABI1. Endogenous
MENA and ABL1 (189980) coprecipitated with epitope-tagged ABI1 from
human embryonic kidney cells. ABI1 dramatically promoted ABL1-mediated
tyrosine phosphorylation of MENA, but not of other substrates. Mutation
analysis demonstrated that Mena was tyrosine phosphorylated on tyr296.

Using a rat adenocarcinoma cell line and nude mice, Philippar et al.
(2008) found that 1 splice variant of Mena encodes an isoform that
functions in cell invasion. This isoform, which they called Mena(INV),
promoted carcinoma cell motility and invasiveness in vivo and in vitro
and increased lung metastasis. Both Mena and Mena(INV) potentiated EGF
(131530)-induced membrane protrusion and increased the matrix
degradation activity of tumor cells. However, Mena(INV) more efficiently
drove metastases and sensitized cells to EGF-dependent membrane
protrusion and invasion.

GENE STRUCTURE

Urbanelli et al. (2006) determined that the ENAH gene contains 14 major
exons and spans approximately 157 kb. Alternative splicing results in
the inclusion of a larger form of exon 6, 2 additional minor exons in
intron 3, and/or an additional intron in exon 7.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Urbanelli et al. (2006) mapped the ENAH
gene to chromosome 1q42.13. They mapped the mouse Enah gene to
chromosome 1H5.

605828	TITLE *605828 TRANSMEMBRANE CHANNEL-LIKE PROTEIN 6; TMC6
;;EPIDERMODYSPLASIA VERRUCIFORMIS GENE 1; EVER1; EV1
DESCRIPTION For phenotypic information on epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), see
226400.

CLONING

Ramoz et al. (2002) positionally cloned the EVER1 gene from the EV1
locus on 17q25 (Ramoz et al., 1999). Computational analysis of the EV1
interval on the Human Genome Draft Sequence allowed construction of a
contig of partially sequenced overlapping BACs. The region contained the
genes encoding thymidine kinase-1 (TK1; 188300) and synaptogyrin-2
(SYNGR2; 603926) as well as the EV1 and EV2 genes, which were assigned
the symbols EVER1 and EVER2 (605829), respectively. The EVER1 gene
encodes 2 alternatively spliced proteins, one of 805 amino acids and the
other of 454 amino acids, in the same open reading frame. The EVER1
protein was predicted to contain 10 transmembrane domains and 2 leucine
zipper motifs. EVER1 shares approximately 75% amino acid identity with a
mouse homolog, and EVER1 and EVER2 share approximately 28% of their
constituent amino acids. EVER1 and EVER2 are expressed in the cytoplasm
and colocalize with calnexin (114217), an integral membrane protein
located in the endoplasmic reticulum.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ramoz et al. (2002) determined that the EVER1 gene contains 20 exons.
The EVER1 and EVER2 genes are in opposite orientation from the first
in-frame ATG start codon and are separated by 4,732 bp.

MAPPING

Ramoz et al. (1999) mapped a susceptibility locus for epidermodysplasia
verruciformis (226400) to chromosome 17qter (EV1), within the 1-cM
interval between markers D17S939 and D17S802 in 3 consanguineous
families. Ramoz et al. (2000) performed genotyping for 10 microsatellite
markers spanning 29 cM around EV1 in 2 additional consanguineous
epidermodysplasia verruciformis families. Using homozygosity mapping,
linkage with 17qter markers was observed in 1 family, and multipoint
linkage analysis yielded maximum multipoint lod score values above 10
between markers D17S1839 and D17S802, encompassing the EV1 locus.

Ramoz et al. (2002) narrowed the EV1 interval to about 180 kb on 17q25
and cloned the EVER1 gene from this region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ramoz et al. (2002) studied 2 Algerian and 2 Colombian consanguineous
families who had been previously described (Ramoz et al., 1999; Ramoz et
al., 2000) and an additional EV1-linked Algerian family in which an
individual was affected with HPV5. In 2 Algerian families and in 1
Colombian family, Ramoz et al. (2002) found that epidermodysplasia
verruciformis was associated with homozygosity for separate nonsense
mutations of the EVER1 gene. They also found 2 mutations in the EVER2
gene.

In a Japanese woman with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, Tate et al.
(2004) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the EVER1
gene (605828.0003-605828.0004).

homozygosity for a C-to-T transition of nucleotide 280 in the TMC6 cDNA,
predicted to cause a nonsense change, arg94 to ter (R94X). Affected
individuals in the 2 families shared the same haplotype markers in
homozygosity, suggesting a common ancestral mutation.

in the TMC6 gene: a 744C-A transversion in exon 8, resulting in a
tyr248-to-ter mutation (Y248X), and an IVS8AS-2A-T transversion
(605828.0004). The patient had suffered from warts beginning when she
was a teenager. Excision of Bowen disease from the skin of the hand was
carried out 3 times at the ages of 51, 52, and 64 years, and gastrectomy
was performed for gastric cancer when she was 53 years of age. Multiple
skin cancers of the face showed squamous cell carcinoma and Bowen
disease. The parents were unaffected and were not related. Three of 6
sibs were also affected.

612681	TITLE *612681 CUGBP- AND ELAV-LIKE FAMILY, MEMBER 6; CELF6
;;BRUNO-LIKE 6; BRUNOL6;;
CUGBP- AND ETR3-LIKE FACTOR 6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF6, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for human sequences similar to Xenopus Brunol1
(TNRC4; 612678), Good et al. (2000) identified BRUNOL6. The deduced
protein contains 2 N-terminal domain RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs), a
long linker region, and a C-terminal RRM.

By searching genomic sequences from CELF-like proteins, followed by PCR
of a human brain cDNA library, Ladd et al. (2004) cloned full-length
BRUNOL6, which they called CELF6. The deduced 481-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 50.4 kD. CELF6 has 3 RRMs, with a
268-amino acid divergent domain separating RRM2 and RRM3. It also has
numerous potential phosphorylation sites, a potential nuclear
localization signal at the C terminus, and an alanine-rich region within
the divergent domain. Ladd et al. (2004) also identified 3 splice
variants of CELF6 that encode proteins with C-terminal truncations
compared with full-length CELF6 (isoform-1). Isoform-2 contains RRM1 and
part of RRM2, isoform-3, the shortest isoform, contains only RRM1, and
isoform-4 contains RRM1, RRM2, and part of the divergent domain.
Northern blot analysis detected 7.5- and 4.0-kb transcripts that were
abundantly expressed in kidney and brain, respectively. Both variants
were detected at low levels in several other tissues. RNA dot blot
analysis revealed highest CELF6 expression in adult kidney, brain, and
testis, with low expression in most other tissues. CELF6 was detected in
fetal brain, but only low expression was detected in fetal kidney.
Western blot analysis showed that full-length CELF6, isoform-2, and
isoform-4 were expressed in transfected quail fibroblasts, but isoform-3
was not detected, apparently due to protein instability.

GENE FUNCTION

CELF proteins (e.g., TNRC4; 612678) promote active exon inclusion of
cardiac troponin T (TNNT2; 191045) minigenes in vivo via muscle-specific
splicing enhancer (MSE) sequences. Ladd et al. (2004) showed that
full-length CELF6, isoform-2, and isoform-4 promoted exon inclusion from
these minigenes in a dose- and isoform-dependent manner. Full-length
CELF6 also promoted insulin receptor (INSR; 147670) exon 11 skipping in
a dose-dependent manner, similar to CUGBP (601074), whereas CELF6
isoform-4 showed weaker exon skipping potential, and isoform-2 had no
effect.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the BRUNOL6 gene
to chromosome 15q24.

613741	TITLE *613741 GLYCOGEN PHOSPHORYLASE, LIVER; PYGL
;;LGP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphorylases (EC 2.4.1.1), such as PYGL, remove glycosyl units from
the terminal branches of glycogen through phosphorolysis, forming
glucose 1-phosphate. During stress, exercise, hypoxia, and hypoglycemia,
phosphorylase activity is primarily regulated by interconversion of the
active phosphorylated form and the inactive, nonphosphorylated form
(summary by Ercan-Fang et al., 2002).

CLONING

Newgard et al. (1986) reported the cDNA sequence encoding human liver
glycogen phosphorylase. The deduced protein contains 845 amino acids.

Burwinkel et al. (1998) reported corrections in the previously reported
PYGL coding sequence and polymorphisms in that sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

Burwinkel et al. (1998) reported a partial PYGL gene structure showing
introns in the same positions as in PYGM (608455), which encodes the
muscle isoform of phosphorylase.

MAPPING

By the method of chromosome sorting and spot blotting, Newgard et al.
(1987) assigned the structural gene for hepatic phosphorylase to
chromosome 14. The gene in the mouse maps to chromosome 12 (Glaser et
al., 1989).

Gross (2011) mapped the PYGL gene to chromosome 14q22.1 based on an
alignment of the PYGL sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF046785) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells, Ercan-Fang et al.
(2002) measured the effects of small molecular mass molecules on the
phosphorylase activities of the rat and human LGP active forms (LGPa).
When added individually at estimated physiologic concentrations, AMP
stimulated, whereas ADP, ATP, and glucose inhibited, both enzymes.
However, glucose inhibition was about 2-fold more potent with the human
enzyme. UDP-glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, and fructose 1-phosphate were
only minor inhibitors of both enzymes. When all effectors were present
in combination at estimated intracellular concentrations, the net effect
reduced human LGPa activity, but it had little effect on rat Lgpa
activity. This inhibition of human LGPa was glucose dependent.
Ercan-Fang et al. (2002) concluded that glucose may be a major regulator
of human LGPa activity, since glucose concentration changes greatly with
feeding and fasting.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 patients with glycogen storage disease VI (GSD6; 232700), also
known as Hers disease, Burwinkel et al. (1998) identified mutations in
the PYGL gene in homozygous or compound heterozygous state
(613741.0001-613741.0004).

By sequencing genomic DNA in a Mennonite family segregating glycogen
storage disease VI, Chang et al. (1998) identified a homozygous
abnormality of the intron 13 splice donor (613741.0005). This mutation
was estimated to be present on 3% of Mennonite chromosomes.

EVOLUTION

Newgard et al. (1986) compared the human liver phosphorylase cDNA
sequence with the previously determined rabbit muscle phosphorylase
sequence. Despite an amino acid identity of 80%, the 2 cDNAs exhibited a
remarkable divergence in G+C content. In the sequence for muscle
phosphorylase, 86% of the nucleotides at the third codon position are
either deoxyguanosine or deoxycytidine residues whereas in the liver
homolog the figure is only 60%. The liver phosphorylase cDNA appeared to
represent an evolutionary mosaic; the segment encoding the N-terminal 80
amino acids contained more than 90% G+C at the third codon position.
Newgard et al. (1986) proposed that the high G+C content in the
N-terminal region of the liver message indicates that this segment was
spliced onto the liver gene from the muscle gene long after the
divergence of liver and muscle tissues. This appears to be evidence for
exon shuffling as proposed by Gilbert (1978). Newgard et al. (1986)
considered it of interest, however, that organisms such as the
thermophilic bacteria and the protozoan Leischmania, which are exposed
to environmental stresses of high temperature and low pH, respectively,
have high G+C content in their coding sequences, presumably because the
greatest stability of G-C basepairs aids the processes of gene
replication, transcription, and, to a lesser extent, translation.
Possibly skeletal muscle, which undergoes a fall in pH and a rise in
temperature during exercise, represents a similarly stressful
environment that selectively maintains high G+C content in expressed
genes.

GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, IVS14DS, G-A, +1

In a 4.5-year-old boy with glycogen storage disease VI (232700), the son
of first-cousin Israeli-Arab Bedouin parents, Burwinkel et al. (1998)
described a splice site mutation. The patient presented at 2 years of
age with hepatomegaly and growth retardation, but had no clinical
history of fasting hypoglycemia. He was found to be homozygous for an
insertion of 119 nucleotides in codon R589, resulting in a frameshift
and introducing a stop codon after 5 missense codons. Sequencing showed
that the insert was an intron, presumably intron 14, but with a G-to-A
replacement in the GT consensus dinucleotide of the 5-prime splice site.
This splice site mutation thus led to the retention of intron 14 and 2
aberrant splice products employing neighboring GT dinucleotides in exon
14 and in intron 14, respectively, as illegitimate 5-prime splice sites.
Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE VI
PYGL, IVS4AS, G-C, -1

In a boy with glycogen storage disease VI (232700), the son of unrelated
and healthy parents of Suriname Hindustani background, Burwinkel et al.
(1998) identified a splice site mutation in the PYGL gene.. The patient
presented at age 2 years with hepatomegaly and severe growth
retardation. Transaminases were intermittently elevated. Marked glycogen
storage in hepatocytes was demonstrated. There was no known parental
consanguinity. The child was found to be heterozygous for a G-to-C
substitution in the AG consensus of the 3-prime splice site of intron 4
of the PYGL gene. Two missense mutations, val221 to ile (V221I) and
asn338 to ser (N338S), were found on the other allele. Burwinkel et al.
(1998) thought that the N338S mutation was probably the second disease
mutation because codon N338 is absolutely conserved in all 3 isoforms of
glycogen phosphorylase and also conserved in plants, yeast, and
bacterial phosphorylases; the same cannot be said for the V221.

In a girl with glycogen storage disease VI (232700), the daughter of
consanguineous Turkish parents, Burwinkel et al. (1998) found
homozygosity for an asn376-to-lys missense (N376K) mutation in the PYGL
gene. The patient presented with hepatomegaly at the age of 1 year. Body
length was at the fiftieth percentile, but weight was at the tenth
percentile. Transaminases, triglycerides, and cholesterol were elevated.
There was a heavy accumulation of glycogen in the liver.

PYGL, IVS13DS, G-A, +1

In affected members of a Mennonite kindred with an autosomal recessive
form of glycogen storage disease (232700), Chang et al. (1998) found
that the consensus GT at the splice donor site of intron 13 was
converted to AT in the PYGL gene. This mutation predicts a PYGL protein
with a deletion of either 3 or 34 amino acids.

607533	TITLE *607533 DIS3 MITOTIC CONTROL, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; DIS3
;;RIBOSOMAL RNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN 44, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; RRP44;;
KIAA1008
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNA exosome is an approximately 400-kD multimeric ribonucleolytic
complex that participates in both endonucleolytic and 3-prime/5-prime
exonucleolytic activity in RNA processing and in the degradation of a
variety of RNA substrates. DIS3 is a catalytic subunit that has both
endonucleolytic and 3-prime/5-prime exonucleolytic activity (summary by
Tomecki et al., 2010).

CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned DIS3, which they designated
KIAA1008. The deduced 928-amino acid protein shares 44.5% identity with
the mitotic control protein Dis3 of S. pombe. PCR-ELISA detected low to
moderate expression in all tissues and brain regions tested, with
highest expression in testis and moderate expression in kidney, ovary,
corpus callosum, spinal cord, and fetal brain.

By sequence analysis of chromosome 13q21-q22 to identify a breast cancer
susceptibility gene, Rozenblum et al. (2002) identified DIS3. The
deduced protein contains 958 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression.

By searching a human EST database for sequences similar to yeast Dis3,
Tomecki et al. (2010) identified DIS3. The deduced 958-amino acid
protein contains a well conserved N-terminal PIN domain, followed by 2
cold-shock domains, an RNB exonuclease catalytic domain, and a
C-terminal S1 domain. DIS3 localized predominantly to the nucleus in
HEK293 and HeLa cells, with exclusion from nucleoli.

GENE FUNCTION

Tomecki et al. (2010) found that epitope-tagged human DIS3 or DIS3L
(614183) coimmunoprecipitated with core exosome subunits from
transfected HEK293 cells. Depletion of DIS3 or RRP6 (EXOSC10; 605960)
from HeLa cells resulted in the accumulation of nuclear 5.8 rRNA
precursors, an effect that was exacerbated by RRP6/DIS3 double
knockdown. Double depletion also resulted in partial stabilization of
cytoplasmic MYC (190080) mRNA. DIS3 purified from transfected HEK293
cells showed 3-prime/5-prime exonuclease activity against
single-stranded RNA and endonuclease activity against a circular RNA
substrate. Domain analysis revealed that the PIN and RNB domains of DIS3
conferred endonuclease and exonuclease activity, respectively.
Expression of human DIS3 could partially complement Dis3 depletion in
yeast.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rozenblum et al. (2002) determined that the DIS3 gene contains 21 exons
and spans 26.5 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rozenblum et al. (2002) mapped the DIS3
gene to chromosome 13q21-q22.

600754	TITLE *600754 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 14; MMP14
;;MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 14, MEMBRANE-TYPE;;
MEMBRANE-TYPE MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 1;;
MT1-MMP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are Zn(2+)-binding endopeptidases that
degrade various components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The MMPs
are enzymes implicated in normal and pathologic tissue remodeling
processes, wound healing, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion. MMPs have
different substrate specificities and are encoded by different genes.
Sato et al. (1994) cloned a cDNA for the human gene from a placenta cDNA
library (they called the gene MMP-X1 and the gene product membrane-type
metalloproteinase). The authors noted that the protein was expressed at
the surface of invasive tumor cells. Using degenerate PCR, Takino et al.
(1995) cloned the entire genomic sequence of this member of the MMP
superfamily (see MMP1; 120353). The cDNA identified codes for a
582-amino acid protein which shared conserved sequence and a similar
domain structure to other MMPs. They noted that the cDNA, termed MMP-X1
by them, had a unique transmembrane domain at the C terminus. Thus, they
predicted that MMP-X1 was a membrane spanning protein rather than a
secretory protein like the other MMPs. Northern blots showed that MMP-X1
expression was present at varying intensity in almost all tissues
examined, but was highest in the placenta.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Mignon et al. (1995) mapped the MMP14
gene to chromosome 14q11-q12.

GENE FAMILY

Mignon et al. (1995) tabulated 11 members of the matrix
metalloproteinase family and their chromosomal locations; with 1
exception, the genes encoding them had been mapped. Six of them,
including 3 collagenases and 2 stromelysins, had been assigned to 11q.

GENE FUNCTION

Mignon et al. (1995) stated that membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP14) may be an activator of pro-gelatinase A (MMP2; 120360) and is
expressed in fibroblast cells during both wound healing and human cancer
progression.

Ueda et al. (2002) investigated survivin gene and protein expression in
a tumor-like benign disease, endometriosis, and correlated them with
apoptosis and invasive phenotype of endometriotic tissues. Gene
expression levels of survivin (603352), MMP2, MMP9 (120361), and MMP14
in 63 pigmented or nonpigmented endometriotic tissues surgically
obtained from 35 women with endometriosis were compared with those in
normal eutopic endometrium obtained from 12 women without endometriosis.
Survivin, MMP2, MMP9, and MMP14 mRNA expression levels in clinically
aggressive pigmented lesions were significantly higher than those in
normal eutopic endometrium, and survivin gene expression in pigmented
lesions was also higher than that in nonpigmented lesions (P less than
0.05). There was a close correlation between survivin and MMP2, MMP9,
and MMP14 gene expression levels in 63 endometriotic tissues examined (P
less than 0.01). The authors concluded that upregulation of survivin and
MMPs may cooperatively contribute to survival and invasion of
endometriosis.

Noda et al. (2003) studied MMPs and their activation in association with
the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR; 603933).
They demonstrated that pro-MMP2 was efficiently activated in the
fibrovascular tissues of PDR, probably through interaction with MT1-MMP
and TIMP2 (188825). The results suggested that MMP2 and MT1-MMP may be
involved in the formation of the fibrovascular tissues.

Hotary et al. (2003) found that MT1-MMP conferred human tumor cell lines
with a 3-dimensional growth advantage in vitro and in vivo. The
replicative advantage conferred by MT1-MMP required pericellular
proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, as proliferation was suppressed
by protease-resistant collagen gels. In the absence of proteolysis,
tumor cells embedded in extracellular matrices were trapped in a
compact, spherical configuration and were unable to undergo changes in
cell shape or cytoskeletal reorganization required for 3-dimensional
growth.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a proband with Winchester syndrome (WNCHRS; 277950), originally
described by Winchester et al. (1969), Evans et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous missense mutation in the MMP14 gene (600754.0001). The
mutation, which occurred in the hydrophobic region of the signal
peptide, decreased MMP14 membrane localization with consequent
impairment of pro-MMP2 activation.

ANIMAL MODEL

By gene targeting, Holmbeck et al. (1999) generated mice deficient in
the Mmp14 gene, which they called MT1-MMP. Mmp14 deficiency caused
craniofacial dysmorphism, arthritis, osteopenia, dwarfism, and fibrosis
of soft tissues due to ablation of a collagenolytic activity that is
essential for modeling of skeletal and extraskeletal connective tissues.
These findings demonstrated the pivotal function of MMP14 in connective
tissue metabolism and illustrated that modeling of the soft connective
tissue matrix by resident cells is essential for the development and
maintenance of the hard tissues of the skeleton.

The MMP family, which has approximately 25 members in mammals, has been
implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling associated with embryonic
development, cancer formation and progression, and various other
physiologic and pathologic events. Oh et al. (2004) stated that at the
time of their report, inactivating mutations in individual matrix
metalloproteinase genes in mice were nonlethal, at least for the first
few weeks after birth, suggesting functional redundancy among MMP family
members. The authors reported that mice lacking 2 MMPs, a nonmembrane
type (MMP2; 120360) and a membrane type (MT1-MMP), die immediately after
birth with respiratory failure, abnormal blood vessels, and immature
muscle fibers reminiscent of central core disease (117000). In the
absence of Mmp2 and MT1-MMP, myoblast fusion in vitro was also
significantly retarded. These findings suggested functional overlap in
mice between the 2 MMPs with distinct molecular natures. Mutations in
both were synthetically lethal in mice.

Chun et al. (2006) showed that Mt1-mmp coordinated adipocyte
differentiation in mice. In the absence of Mt1-mmp, white adipose tissue
development was aborted, leaving tissues populated by mini-adipocytes
that rendered null mice lipodystrophic. Null preadipocytes were able to
differentiate into functional adipocytes in a 2-dimensional culture, but
not in a 3-dimensional gel.

In a proband with Winchester syndrome (WNCHRS; 277950), originally

homozygous 284C-G transversion in the MMP14 gene, resulting in a
thr17-to-arg (T17R) substitution. The mutation, which occurred in the
hydrophobic region of the signal peptide, decreased MMP14 membrane
localization with consequent impairment of pro-MMP2 activation. The
mutation was not present in the dbSNP132 or 1000 Genomes databases or in
100 Puerto Rican control chromosomes.

600025	TITLE *600025 KINESIN LIGHT CHAIN 1; KLC1
;;KINESIN 2; KNS2;;
KNS2A;;
KLC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Kinesins are tubulin (see 191130) molecular motors that transport
organelles within cells and move chromosomes along microtubules during
cell division. In sea urchin and mammalian cells, kinesins have been
characterized as tetrameric proteins containing 2 heavy (alpha) chains
of approximately 120 kD and 2 light (beta) chains of approximately 70
kD. The alpha chains provide the tubulin binding site and the ATPase
domains, whereas the beta chains are responsible for the specific
attachment of the organelle to be moved by the kinesin tetramer.
Kinesins transport their bound organelle to the plus end of the
microtubule (summary by Chernajovsky et al., 1996).

CLONING

Chernajovsky et al. (1996) noted that differential splicing occurs for
the kinesin beta (light chain) cDNA sequences at the 3-prime end of the
rat kinesin mRNA, producing kinesins having different C-terminal ends
that seem to confer the kinesin specificity for organelle binding.
Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (1993) isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding the
human kinesin light chain protein (KLC). The cDNA encodes a deduced
polypeptide of 569 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 64,789
Da. The predicted secondary internal structure of the KLC molecule
consists of about 27 contiguous repeats, each of approximately 21 amino
acids, and could be divided into 3 domains.

Rahman et al. (1998) cloned mouse Klc1. The deduced 581-amino acid
protein has an N-terminal coiled-coil region of about 100 amino acids
and 6 imperfect tetratricopeptide repeats of about 34 amino acids each.
Northern and Western blot analyses detected Klc1 predominantly in mouse
central and peripheral neuronal tissues. Immunofluorescence analysis of
cultured rat hippocampal precursor cells showed that Klc1 levels
increased with differentiation. In situ hybridization of mouse brain
showed that both Klc1 and Klc2 (611729) were enriched in olfactory bulb,
hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and the granular layer of cerebellum. Klc1
was expressed in a subset of cells in the sciatic nerve and showed
diffuse axonal staining. Fractionation of whole mouse brain extracts
revealed Klc1 and Klc2 in the cytosolic fraction and Klc2 in the
microsomal fraction.

GENE FUNCTION

Chernajovsky et al. (1996) characterized the human KNS2 gene product of
a differentially spliced, T-cell-derived mRNA and cloned its promoter
region. The promoter region transcribes constitutively. In permanently
transfected human HeLa and NB100 neuroblastoma cells, a reporter gene
containing the promoter and part of the first exon of beta kinesin was
75-fold more active than the HSV-tk promoter. The first exon contains a
5-prime untranslated sequence capable of forming a stable double-hairpin
loop, which functions as a translational enhancer. Its deletion
decreases the efficiency of in vitro translation of beta kinesin mRNA.

Kamal et al. (2000) demonstrated that the axonal transport of APP
(104760) in neurons is mediated by the direct binding of APP to the
light chain subunit of kinesin-1.

Using anti-mouse Klc1 antibodies to immunoprecipitate proteins from
mouse brain lysates, Rahman et al. (1998) showed that Klc1 associated
with Nkhc (KIF5A; 602821) and Ukhc (KIF5B; 602809), but not with Klc2.
In the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, both Klc1 and Klc2
cosedimented with taxol-stabilized mouse brain microtubules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chernajovsky et al. (1996) determined that the entire KNS2 gene spans 90
kb and encodes a 70-kD protein.

MAPPING

Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (1993) assigned the KLC gene to chromosome 14 by
screening of a human/hamster somatic cell hybrid panel. Goedert et al.
(1996) mapped the KNS2 gene to 14q32.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

;;PCTAIRE PROTEIN KINASE 3; PCTK3;;
PCTAIRE3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The PCTAIRE protein kinases comprise a distinct subfamily of the CDC2
(116940)-related serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. See PCTK1
(311550). Meyerson et al. (1992) isolated a partial cDNA encoding
PCTAIRE3. Like other members of the PCTAIRE subfamily, the predicted
PCTAIRE3 protein contains an N-terminal extension relative to CDC2. The
CDC2-related region of PCTAIRE3, excluding the N-terminal extension,
shares 51%, 79%, and 80% protein sequence identity with CDC2, PCTK1, and
PCTK2 (603440), respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that
PCTAIRE3 is expressed in a variety of human cell lines and tissues.
Okuda et al. (1992) identified the mouse homolog of PCTK3.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Okuda et al. (1994) mapped the
CDK18 gene to 1q31-q32.

605737	TITLE *605737 BACULOVIRAL IAP REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 7; BIRC7
;;INHIBITOR OF APOPTOSIS PROTEIN, MELANOMA; MLIAP;;
INHIBITOR OF APOPTOSIS PROTEIN, KIDNEY; KIAP;;
LIVIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) contain conserved, unique
N-terminal baculovirus IAP repeats (BIRs) and usually a C-terminal RING
finger domain. The BIR domain is essential for inhibitory activity and
typically interacts with cysteine-containing aspartate-specific
proteases (caspases, e.g., CASP3; 600636) or with APAF1 (602233), which
together with cytochrome C (123970) mediates activation of CASP9
(602234). The RING finger domain sometimes enhances antiapoptotic
activity but does not inhibit apoptosis alone.

CLONING

By searching a sequence database for BIR-containing sequences, Vucic et
al. (2000) identified cDNAs encoding BIRC7, which they termed MLIAP. The
deduced 280- and 298-amino acid BIRC7 proteins each contain a single BIR
domain and a RING finger motif. The BIR domain is most similar to the
second and third BIRs of BIRC2 (601712), BIRC3 (601721), and BIRC4
(XIAP; 300079). Northern blot analysis revealed highest expression of
1.5- and 2.2-kb transcripts in melanomas, with lower expression in some
lymphomas, fetal kidney, fetal liver, testis, and thymus; expression was
not detected in normal melanocytes. Confocal microscopy showed
localization predominantly to the cytoplasm and, unlike that of survivin
(BIRC5; 603352), not to mitotic spindles.

Lin et al. (2000) also cloned BIRC7, which they called KIAP, by
searching an EST database and using 5-prime and 3-prime RACE on a fetal
kidney cDNA library. Like apollon (BIRC6; 605638) and survivin, the
deduced 299-amino acid BIRC7 protein contains only 1 BIR motif with the
signature 3 cysteines and 1 histidine. Northern blot analysis detected
1.4-, 2.2-, and 4.0-kb transcripts in placenta, lymph node, and fetal
kidney; expression was not detected in other normal tissues tested.

Kasof and Gomes (2001) also cloned BIRC7, which they termed livin. The
deduced 280-amino acid protein lacks the coiled-coil domain found in
survivin but does have a RING finger. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of 1.4-, 2.0-, and 2.8-kb transcripts in placenta and fetal
brain, as well as in melanomas and, to a lesser extent, in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Vucic et al. (2000) showed that expression of
BIRC7 blocked apoptosis induced by engagement of FAS (134637), tumor
necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1; 191190), death receptor-4 (DR4;
603611), and DR5 (603612), as well as apoptosis induced by
chemotherapeutic agents, with a potency comparable to that observed with
BIRC2 and BIRC4. Further analysis indicated that MLIAP is active against
CASP3 and the cytochrome C pathway but not against CASP7 (601761).
Mutational analysis determined that the BIR domain is essential for
antiapoptotic activity.

Lin et al. (2000) showed that BIRC7 blocked apoptosis induced by BAX
(600040) induction of cytochrome C release from mitochondria. The
authors also found that BIRC7 blocked apoptosis induced by
chemotherapeutic agents, but in contrast to the findings of Vucic et al.
(2000), it did not block apoptosis induced by FAS.

Kasof and Gomes (2001) demonstrated that, through its BIR domain, livin
inhibited apoptosis mediated by DR6 and downstream adaptor proteins
within the TNF/FAS pathway. This inhibition could be reversed by an
antisense construct to livin. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot
analysis indicated livin binds to CASP3, CASP7, and CASP9, but it only
inhibits CASP9. In contrast to the findings of Vucic et al. (2000),
immunofluorescence microscopy detected overexpressed livin in the
nucleus and in a filamentous pattern in the cytoplasm, as observed with
survivin.

The identification of antigens associated with tumor destruction is a
major goal of cancer immunology. Vaccination with irradiated tumor cells
engineered to secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF2; 138960) generates potent, specific, and long-lasting antitumor
immunity through improved tumor antigen presentation by dendritic cells
and macrophages. A phase I clinical trial of this immunization strategy
in patients with disseminated melanoma revealed the consistent induction
in distant metastases of dense T- and B-cell infiltrates that
effectuated substantial tumor necrosis and fibrosis (Soiffer et al.,
1998). To delineate the target antigens of this vaccine-stimulated tumor
destruction, Schmollinger et al. (2003) screened a melanoma cDNA
expression library with postimmunization sera from a long-term
responding patient. High-titer IgG antibodies recognized MLIAP. Although
the patient harbored antibodies to this protein at the time of study
entry, multiple courses of vaccination over 4 years increased antibody
titers and elicited isotype switching. Moreover, lymphocyte infiltrates
in necrotic metastases included CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells specific for
MLIAP, as revealed by proliferation, tetramer, enzyme-linked immunospot,
and cytotoxicity analysis. Whereas melanoma cells in densely infiltrated
lesions showed strong MLIAP expression by immunohistochemistry, lethal
disease progression was associated with the loss of MLIAP staining and
the absence of lymphocyte infiltrates. These findings demonstrated that
MLIAP can serve as a target for immune-mediated tumor destruction, but
that antigen-loss variants can lead to immune escape.

Ye et al. (2013) found that microRNA-198 (MIR198; 605547) downregulated
livin expression in human prostate cancer cells by directly binding to
the livin 3-prime UTR.

MAPPING

Vucic et al. (2000) mapped the BIRC7 gene to 20q13, a region frequently
amplified in melanomas and other malignancies, using radiation hybrid
analysis. By FISH, Lin et al. (2000) localized the BIRC7 gene to
20q13.3.

;;PROTEASOME ACTIVATOR 28-GAMMA; PA28G;;

KI ANTIGEN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PSME3 belongs to the proteasome activator subunit (PSME) gene family.
For background information on the PSME gene family, see PSME1 (600654).

CLONING

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) produce
autoantibodies against a number of nuclear antigens, including SNRP70
(180740), PCNA (176740), CDR1 (302650), and Ki. By screening a human
placenta cDNA library with a probe obtained by screening a bovine retina
cDNA library with anti-Ki sera from an SLE patient, Nikaido et al.
(1990) isolated a cDNA encoding PSME3, which they called Ki. Sequence
analysis predicted that the 254-amino acid, hydrophilic PSME3 protein
contains a nuclear localization signal and has a molecular mass of
approximately 30 kD, close to the 32 kD observed by Western blot
analysis. PSME3 shares over 99% amino acid identity with the bovine
sequence. RNA blot analysis of human placenta, bovine brain, and mouse
embryos detected 3.0- and 1.5-kb PSME3 transcripts.

GENE FUNCTION

Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC3, or NCOA3; 601937) is an oncogene
frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer. Using
immunoprecipitation analysis, Li et al. (2006) found that endogenous
SRC3 and REG-gamma interacted in HeLa cell nuclear extracts and MCF-7
breast cancer cells. Protein pull-down assays showed the REG-gamma
interacted specifically with the HAT domain of SRC3. Knockdown of
REG-gamma via RNA interference (RNAi) in breast cancer and human
embryonic kidney cell lines resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in SRC3
protein levels. Conversely, REG-gamma overexpression in HeLa cells
reduced SRC3 protein levels. In vitro proteasome assays using purified
proteins showed that REG-gamma promoted degradation of SRC3 by the 20S
proteasome in a ubiquitin- and ATP-independent manner. Knockdown of
REG-gamma via RNAi increased estrogen receptor (ER; see 133430) target
gene expression and enhanced estradiol-mediated cell growth in MCF-7
cells, and these effects were secondary to the effect of REG-gamma on
SRC3.

MAPPING

By analysis of overlapping YAC contigs and by FISH, Albertsen et al.
(1994) mapped the PSME3 gene to 17q12-q21. Kandil et al. (1997) mapped
the mouse Psme3 gene to chromosome 14 using interspecific backcross
analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Barton et al. (2004) found that mice lacking Psme3 had normal levels of
surface class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules,
slightly reduced Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells, and normal responses
to infection with influenza or SV40 virus. However, the ability of Psme3
-/- mice to clear the pulmonary fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum
was slower than wildtype mice. Barton et al. (2004) proposed that PSME3
functions in the MHC class I antigen-processing pathway and that it
exerts an influence on proteasome cleavage specificity.

608821	TITLE *608821 KERATIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1-4; KRTAP1-4
;;KAP1.4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The main structural proteins of mammalian hair fiber are the hair
keratins (see 601077) and the keratin-associated proteins (KAPs), which
form a rigid and resistant hair shaft through extensive disulfide bond
crosslinking with the abundant cysteines of hair keratins (Shimomura et
al., 2002).

CLONING

By screening a human PAC library and an arrayed human scalp cDNA
library, Rogers et al. (2001) cloned KAP1.4. The deduced 121-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 12.3 kD. KAP1.4 is classified
as a high sulfur protein owing to a cysteine content of 24.8 mol %. It
contains 2 unique motifs conserved among KAP1 family members, several
characteristic pentapeptide repeats, and a 20-amino acid subdomain that
was conserved among KAP1 family members in all species examined. KAP1.4
lacks an amino-terminal motif common to other members of the KAP1
family.

Shimomura et al. (2002) analyzed the KAP1.4 gene in unrelated Japanese
and Caucasian individuals. By in situ hybridization, Shimomura et al.
(2002) demonstrated KAP1.4 expression in the middle to upper cortex
region of the human hair follicle. While Shimomura et al. (2002) found
polymorphism in the KAP1.1 (608819) and KAP1.3 (608820) genes in
Japanese and Caucasian individuals, they found none in the KAP1.4 gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rogers et al. (2001) stated that the KRTAP1-4 gene is about 1.0 kb long
and consists of a single exon.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rogers et al. (2001) mapped the KRTAP1-4
gene to a region of chromosome 17q12-q21 that contains 8 other
identified KAP genes or pseudogenes.

608610	TITLE *608610 PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH 4; PDCD4
;;NEOPLASTIC TRANSFORMATION INHIBITOR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a glioma cDNA expression library with antibodies raised
against a nuclear protein, Matsuhashi et al. (1997) cloned PDCD4, which
they designated H731. The deduced 458-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 50.6 kD. PDCD4 is an acidic protein with
characteristics of a nuclear nonhistone protein. It contains 2
overlapping GxGxxG nucleotide-binding motifs, which are characteristic
of protein kinases, but it does not have a kinase catalytic domain.
PDCD4 also has several putative serine and threonine phosphorylation
sites. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of about 2.7 and 3.8
kb in HeLa cell total RNA. Recombinant PDCD4 expressed in E. coli
resulted in proteins with apparent molecular masses of 56 and 37 kD. The
37-kD truncated protein was synthesized from val127, reading the val
codon as an f-met initiation codon.

Yoshinaga et al. (1999) found that PDCD4 accumulated in the nuclei of
confluent or quiescent normal fetal lung fibroblasts, but it was
overproduced and localized in the cytoplasm during the cell cycle in
tumor cell lines. Immunohistologic analysis revealed that PDCD4 was
highly expressed in bladder carcinoma and breast carcinoma tissues
compared with normal tissues. PDCD4 was also abundantly expressed in the
small duct epithelial cells of normal mammary gland.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot and Western blot analyses, Kang et al. (2002)
determined that expression of both the PDCD4 transcript and protein was
upregulated in senescent diploid fibroblasts compared with cells in log
phase growth. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that the C terminus of
PDCD4 could interact with a component of the 40S ribosome complex, RPS13
(180476), and with RPL5 (603634) and TI-227H. In vitro binding assays
confirmed the interaction between PDCD4 and RPS13. In vitro pull-down
assays also showed that PDCD4 interacted with EIF4G (600495), but not
with EIF4E (133440). Furthermore, PDCD4 localized to polysome fractions
of fractionated HeLa cells. Kang et al. (2002) concluded that PDCD4 may
regulate EIF4G-dependent translation through direct interaction with
EIF4G and RPS13 in senescent fibroblasts.

Dorrello et al. (2006) found that the tumor suppressor PDCD4 inhibits
the translation initiation factor EIF4A (see 602641), an RNA helicase
that catalyzes the unwinding of secondary structure at the 5-prime
untranslated region of mRNAs. In response to mitogens, PDCD4 was rapidly
phosphorylated on ser67 by the protein kinase S6K1 (608938) and
subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin ligase SCF-beta(TRCP) (603482).
Expression in cultured cells of a stable PDCD4 mutant that was unable to
bind beta-TRCP inhibited translation of an mRNA with a structured
5-prime untranslated region, resulted in smaller cell size, and slowed
down cell cycle progression. Dorrello et al. (2006) proposed that
regulated degradation of PDCD4 in response to mitogens allows efficient
protein synthesis and consequently cell growth.

PDCD4 contains 2 tandem MA3 domains consisting of conserved
alpha-helical hairpins. Using x-ray crystallography, NMR, and surface
plasmon resonance, Suzuki et al. (2008) found that both MA3 domains of
human PDCD4 were structurally and functionally similar and bound
specifically to the N-terminal domain of EIF4A using similar binding
interfaces. The MA3 domains of PDCD4 competed with the MA3 domain of
EIF4G and RNA for EIF4A binding. Suzuki et al. (2008) concluded that
PDCD4 inhibits translation initiation by displacing EIF4G and RNA from
EIF4A. They proposed that the PDCD4 MA3 domains act synergistically to
form a tighter and more stable complex with EIF4A, explaining the need
for 2 tandem MA3 domains.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta (190180) and
BMPs (see 112264) is mediated by miR21 (611020). miR21 downregulates
PDCD4, which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth muscle
contractile genes. Davis et al. (2008) concluded that PDCD4 is a
functional target of miR21 involved in the BMP-mediated induction of
smooth muscle cell markers in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Asangani et al. (2008) identified an miR21 target sequence in the
3-prime UTR of PDCD4 and confirmed binding and inhibition of PDCD4 by
miR21 using reporter gene assays. They observed an inverse correlation
between miR21 and PDCD4 expression in 10 colorectal cell lines and in 22
colorectal cancer tissues and matched normal controls. Transfection of
RKO human colorectal cancer cells with anti-miR21 increased PDCD4
protein concentration, reduced the invasive potential of RKO cells in
3-dimensional gels, and reduced intravasation and lung metastasis of RKO
cells in a chicken embryo metastasis assay. Overexpression of miR21
reduced expression of PDCD4 protein, but not mRNA, in Colo206f cells.

MAPPING

By FISH, Soejima et al. (1999) mapped the PDCD4 gene to chromosome
10q24.

608786	TITLE *608786 PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE; PC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. It is
a key regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and
neurotransmitter synthesis. Human PC is a tetramer composed of identical
subunits (Barden et al., 1974).

CLONING

Using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the amino acid sequence at
the biotin site of pyruvate carboxylase to screen a human liver cDNA
library, Freytag and Collier (1984) isolated 3 cDNA clones for pyruvate
carboxylase. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2-kb mRNA.

Wexler et al. (1994) isolated a PC cDNA, which encodes a deduced
1,178-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 129.6 kD for the
full-length precursor and 127.4 kD for the mature apoprotein. Northern
blot analysis demonstrated that the highest level of PC mRNA is in the
liver. Based on homology with other biotin-containing proteins, the ATP,
pyruvate, and biotin-binding sites were identified. MacKay et al. (1994)
isolated and cloned PC cDNA from human kidney.

Carbone et al. (1998) characterized the PC gene by PCR amplification,
subcloning, and sequencing.

GENE STRUCTURE

Carbone et al. (1998) determined that the PC gene contains 19 exons
spanning approximately 16 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Using Southern blotting of human-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids,
Freytag and Collier (1984) localized the PC gene to the long arm of
chromosome 11.

Rochelle et al. (1992) indicated that the corresponding locus in the
mouse is located on chromosome 19 near the centromere. Comparative
mapping suggested that the human PC locus is in the proximal part of
11q, perhaps 11q12-q13.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization to normal chromosomes and
chromosomes carrying the FRA11A (136560) fragile site, Walker et al.
(1995) mapped PC to 11q13, distal to FRA11A, thus localizing it to
11q13.4-q13.5. Perucca-Lostanlen et al. (1997) used fluorescence in situ
hybridization with yeast artificial chromosome and cosmid probes on
metaphase chromosomes of patients expressing the fragile site to show
that FRA11A is situated centromeric to ACTN3 (102574) and telomeric to
D11S913, these markers being within an interval of approximately 1 Mb in
the 11q13.3 region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 11 Ojibwa and 2 Cree patients with group A pyruvate carboxylase
deficiency (266150), Carbone et al. (1998) identified a missense
mutation in the PC gene (608786.0001). In 2 brothers of Micmac origin,
they identified a transversion mutation in the PC gene (608786.0002).
Carrier frequency was estimated to be as high as 1 in 10 in some
groupings. The 2 point mutations were located in the region of homology
conserved among yeast, rat, and human PC, in the vicinity of the
carboxylation domain of the enzyme.

NOMENCLATURE

Brun et al. (1999) referred to pyruvate carboxylase as a key enzyme in
the gluconeogenesis and anaplerotic metabolic pathways. Anaplerotic is a
somewhat archaic term derived from the Greek stems ana, meaning 'for
up,' and plerotic, meaning 'for filling.' The adjective anaplerotic
refers to a reaction that effects best the formation of an intermediate
of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, in order to maintain the intracellular
concentration of it, or of another such intermediate, as those
intermediates are utilized for biosynthesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, ALA610THR

In 11 Ojibwa and 2 Cree Amerindian patients with simple pyruvate
carboxylase deficiency (266150), Carbone et al. (1998) identified a
homozygous 1828G-A transition in the PC gene, resulting in an
ala610-to-thr (A610T) substitution.

.0002
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, MET743ILE

In 2 Micmac brothers from Nova Scotia with simple pyruvate carboxylase
deficiency (266150), Carbone et al. (1998) identified a 2229G-T
transversion in the PC gene, resulting in a met743-to-ile (M743I)
substitution in the carboxylation domain of the enzyme.

.0003
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, VAL145ALA

In affected members of a consanguineous family with PC deficiency
(266150), Wexler et al. (1998) identified a homozygous 434T-C transition
in the PC gene, resulting in a val145-to-ala (V145A) substitution. Both
parents were heterozygous for the mutation. The patients were found to
have low PC activity (range 2-25% of control) in blood lymphocytes and
skin fibroblasts associated with either diminished or normal protein
levels.

.0004
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, ARG451CYS

In an affected brother and sister from a consanguineous family with PC
deficiency (266150), Wexler et al. (1998) identified a homozygous
1351C-T transition the PC gene, resulting in an arg451-to-cys (R451C)
substitution. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Both
mutations occurred in relatively conserved amino acid residues and were
located in the biotin carboxylase domain.

.0005
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, IVS15, 4-BP DEL, TAGG, +2-5

In 2 brothers with severe (type B) pyruvate carboxylase deficiency
(266150), Carbone et al. (2002) found compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the PC gene: a TAGG deletion at the exon 15/intron 15
splice site (IVS15+2-5delTAGG) and a dinucleotide deletion in exon 16
(2491-2492delGT; 608786.0006). By RT-PCR and sequencing of aberrant
transcripts, Carbone et al. (2002) found that the splice site mutation
resulted in the retention of intron 15 during pre-mRNA splicing. In
addition, both deletions were predicted to result in a frameshift to
generate a premature termination codon such that the encoded mRNA would
be subject to nonsense-mediated decay. In 1 brother, the diagnosis was
made at the age of 4 hours and death occurred at 7 weeks; in the younger
brother, the diagnosis was made in the fetus and death was in the
neonatal period.

PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, ARG156GLN

In a patient with type A PC deficiency (266150), Monnot et al. (2009)
identified a homozygous 467G-A transition in exon 3 of the PC gene,
resulting in an arg156-to-gln (R156Q) substitution in the biotin
carboxylase domain. The mutation had no detectable effect on mRNA size
or amount. Monnot et al. (2009) observed that the relatively milder type
A phenotype results from missense mutations in the PC gene.

.0008
PYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY
PC, ARG583LEU

In a patient with type B PC deficiency (266150), Monnot et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PC gene: a
1748G-T transversion in exon 12, resulting in an arg583-to-leu (R583L)
substitution in the carboxytransferase domain, and a 1-bp duplication in
exon 17 (2876dupT; 608786.0009), resulting in a frameshift,
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and no functional protein. The R583L
mutation had no detectable effect on mRNA size or amount. Monnot et al.
(2009) commented that patients with the relatively more severe type B
tend to have at least 1 truncating mutation in the PC gene.

611030	TITLE *611030 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 30C; TMEM30C
;;CDC50, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, C; CDC50C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of yeast Cdc50 family proteins,
which are involved in polarized cell division, Katoh and Katoh (2004)
identified 3 human CDC50 genes, including TMEM30C, which they called
CDC50C. The predicted CDC50C protein contains 341 amino acids. The human
and yeast CDC50 proteins all have 2 transmembrane domains and an
extracellular loop with 3 cysteines and an N-glycosylation site.

Osada et al. (2007) obtained TMEM30C cDNAs by 3-prime RACE of human and
chimpanzee testis RNA. In both species, the TMEM30C transcripts were
truncated due to mutations in splicing or poly(A) signals relative to
the macaque gene, which encodes 2 splice variants derived from 7 or 8
exons that produce proteins with 1 or 2 transmembrane domains,
respectively. In contrast, the major human transcript originates from 3
exons and lacks a stop codon, suggesting it does not produce a
functional protein. A minor human transcript transcribed from 2 exons
encodes a predicted 113-amino acid protein with 1 transmembrane domain.
RT-PCR showed that TMEM30C was expressed exclusively in testis of human,
macaque, and mouse. Expression of exons 5 through 8 in human and exons 6
through 8 in chimpanzee was not detected, suggesting that the
2-transmembrane form of TMEM30C is dispensable in hominoids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the TMEM30C gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the TMEM30C
gene to chromosome 3q12.

EVOLUTION

By phylogenetic analysis, Osada et al. (2007) showed that an accelerated
rate of amino acid substitutions in TMEM30C occurred after the
divergence of chimps and humans from Old World monkeys. They suggested
that the excess of substitutions might result from positive selection
for a new function or, more likely, relaxation of selection, as occurs
in pseudogenes.

;;MITOCHONDRIAL METALLOCHAPERONE-LIKE PROTEIN;;
C3ORF68
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Based on experiments in yeast, CMC1 is predicted to be a mitochondrial
copper chaperone that facilitates copper incorporation into
mitochondrial enzymes that require copper as a cofactor (Horn et al.,
2008).

CLONING

By searching databases, Horn et al. (2008) identified orthologs of yeast
Cmc1 in vertebrates, flies, and plants. The deduced 106-amino acid human
CMC1 protein contains 4 conserved cysteines in twin Cx(9)C motifs that
are predicted to coordinate copper. Epitope-tagged CMC1 colocalized with
COX subunit 1 (MTCO1; 516030) in a typical mitochondrial network
pattern. In yeast, Cmc1 localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane
space.

GENE FUNCTION

Horn et al. (2008) found that deletion of Cmc1 in yeast impaired cell
growth and respiratory capacity, and reduced synthesis of Cox1. Growth
was significantly increased with exogenous copper supplementation.
Spectroscopic analysis of recombinant yeast Cmc1 was consistent with
Cmc1 coordination of copper as Cu(I)-thiolate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Horn et al. (2008) determined that the CMC1 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Horn et al. (2008) mapped the CMC1 gene to
chromosome 3p24.

PLATELET PROTEOGLYCAN PROTEIN CORE; PPG;;
PROTEOGLYCAN PROTEIN CORE FOR MAST CELL SECRETORY GRANULE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The proteoglycans that are stored in the secretory granules of many
hematopoietic cells contain a peptide core, termed serglycin (or
'serine/glycine-rich peptide core of secretory granule proteoglycan'),
with a protease-resistant, glycosaminoglycan-attachment region
consisting predominantly of alternating serine and glycine residues
(summary by Humphries et al., 1992). Serglycin proteoglycans have been
isolated that contain O-linked heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin
sulfate A, etc.

CLONING

The promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 is a transformed human cell
that synthesizes chondroitin sulfate to proteoglycans and stores the
proteoglycans in its secretory granules. Under certain in vitro
conditions this cell can be induced to differentiate into cells that
resemble neutrophils, monocyte-macrophages, eosinophils, and basophils.
Stevens et al. (1988) used a rat cell-derived cDNA for a proteoglycan to
isolate a cDNA from an HL-60 cell cDNA library. As assessed by Northern
and Southern blot analyses, a single gene encodes the 1.3-kb mRNA for
this proteoglycan peptide core. The deduced amino acid sequence includes
an 18-amino acid glycosaminoglycan attachment region that consists
primarily of alternating serine and glycine.

Perin et al. (1988) characterized the protein core of platelet
proteoglycan and Alliel et al. (1988) determined its complete amino acid
structure by a combination of protein and cDNA sequencing.

Mattei et al. (1989) found that the sequence of the peptide core of the
secretory granule proteoglycan was identical to that of PPG.

Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) synthesize 200- to 250-kD highly
acidic proteoglycans containing glycosaminoglycans that are almost
exclusively chondroitin sulfate E. These intracellular proteoglycans are
stored in secretory granules. Avraham et al. (1989) isolated and
sequenced a full-length cDNA from a mouse BMMC-derived cDNA library. The
same peptide core is found in all cells of bone marrow origin (Austen,
1990); see Rothenberg et al. (1988) and Avraham et al. (1988) for
information on the eosinophil proteoglycan and the basophil
proteoglycan, respectively. Differences in the secretory granules of the
several cell types are related to the sugar moieties that are
polymerized onto the glycine-serine copolymer to form the
glycosoaminoglycan.

Humphries et al. (1992) determined the complete nucleotide sequence of
the human serglycin gene.

MAPPING

By probing DNA from a panel of human/mouse and human/hamster hybrid
cells with the cDNA, Stevens et al. (1988) showed that the gene that
encodes the HL-60 cell proteoglycan peptide core resides on chromosome
10. The mouse gene encoding the proteoglycan peptide core is located on
chromosome 10 (Avraham et al., 1988).

Mattei et al. (1989) showed by in situ hybridization that the PRG1 gene
is located in band 10q22.1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Humphries et al. (1992) determined that the human serglycin gene
contains 3 exons and spans 16.7 kb. The exons and introns 1 and 2
comprise 7, 53, and 40% of the gene, respectively.

;;KIAA0261;;
WAPL;;
FRIEND OF EBNA2; FOE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from an immature myeloid leukemia cell
line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned WAPAL, which they
designated KIAA0261. The WAPAL protein contains 1,287 amino acids. By
Northern blot analysis, moderate expression was detected in placenta,
lung, liver, thymus, prostate, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas,
spleen, testis, ovary, small intestine, and peripheral blood leukocytes
with weak expression in heart, brain, and colon.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear
antigen-2 (EBNA2) sequence as bait to screen an EBV-immortalized B cell
cDNA library, followed by PCR, Kwiatkowski et al. (2004) cloned WAPAL,
which they called FOE. The deduced 1227-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 137 kD. WAPAL contains an N-terminal
arginine-rich motif (ARM), a bipartite nuclear localization sequence, 3
highly acidic domains, 4 predicted coiled-coil domains, and a C-terminal
nuclear export signal. WAPAL shares shares 38% amino acid identity over
the C-terminal region with the parallel sister chromatid product (PASC)
of the Drosophila wapl gene. Northern blot analysis detected 6.5- and
4.4-kb transcripts in all human tissues examined. Multiple tissue
expression array confirmed ubiquitous expression in 72 human tissues
with highest expression in testis and lowest in ovary. Western blot
analysis of hematopoietic and epithelial cell lines detected WAPAL at
approximately 140 kD. Immunofluorescence studies localized WAPAL
throughout the nucleus in HeLa cells with exclusion from regions
adjacent to nucleoli. In mitotic cells, WAPAL was concentrated around
condensed chromosomes in metaphase and in later stages around separating
chromosomes in anaphase. Using subcellular fractionation as well as
immunohistochemical studies, Kwiatkowski et al. (2004) colocalized WAPAL
and EBNA2 to the nuclear matrix and showed partial colocalization of
both WAPAL and EBNA2 in a diffuse granular nuclear-staining pattern
excluded from nucleoli.

Oikawa et al. (2004) independently cloned WAPAL from human testis cDNA
library by PCR using primers derived from the Drosophila wapl sequence.
The deduced protein contains 1,190 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
and quantitative real-time PCR of human cancers and normal tissues
detected significantly higher expression in cervical tumors compared to
normal cervix and normal and tumor tissue from uterine body, ovary,
breast, lung, stomach, kidney, and colon. Immunohistochemistry showed
nuclear localization of WAPAL in all samples.

GENE FUNCTION

Oikawa et al. (2004) showed that WAPL localized to the basal and
parabasal cell layers in benign squamous epithelia but displayed
increased expression and localization extending to more superficial cell
layers in cervical dysplasia and invasive carcinoma, suggesting a role
for WAPL in cervical carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Oikawa et al.
(2004) showed that RNAi of WAPL in cervical carcinoma-derived cell lines
resulted in repressed cell growth and induced cell death. Flow cytometry
of siRNA-transfected cells showed an increase in the number of cells
exhibiting S phase DNA content, which may also be apoptotic cells at
G2-M phase, and an increase in apoptotic cells displaying sub-G1 DNA
content. Oikawa et al. (2004) suggested that malfunction of the WAPL
pathway may activate an S phase checkpoint or other apoptotic pathway
leading to cell death.

Using immunohistochemical analysis in mouse testis, Kuroda et al. (2005)
showed that Wapl localized to large pachytene spermatocytes, with no
staining in condensing forms of sperm. Mouse Wapl localized to the
synaptonemal complex and partially synapsed X and Y chromosomes in early
zygotene and pachytene stage spermatocytes. Kuroda et al. (2005)
suggested that Wapl may play a role in spermatogenesis, possibly in
homologous recombination and DNA recombination.

Kueng et al. (2006) showed that human WAPL interacted with cohesin
throughout the cell cycle in HeLa cells via cohesin's SCC1 (RAD21;
606462) and SA1 (STAG1; 604358)/SA2 (STAG2; 300826) subunits. WAPL also
formed a subcomplex with PDS5A (613200). Like cohesin, WAPL associated
with chromatin from telophase until prophase of the next mitosis.
Depletion of WAPL by RNA interference inhibited dissociation of cohesin
from chromosomes during prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase.
Resolution of chromosome arms was severely impaired in WAPL-depleted
cells until anaphase, which occurred after a delay, implying that
separase (ESPL1; 604143) was activated in the absence of WAPL. Depletion
of WAPL also resulted in increased levels of cohesin on chromatin in
interphase, and cohesin remained bound to chromatin longer in the
absence of WAPL. Kueng et al. (2006) concluded that WAPL is required for
release of cohesin from both interphase chromatin and mitotic
chromosomes.

Rolef Ben-Shahar et al. (2008) identified spontaneous suppressors of the
thermosensitive eco1-1 allele (see 609674) in budding yeast. An
acetylation-mimicking mutation of a conserved lysine in cohesin's Smc3
(606062) subunit makes Eco1 dispensable for cell growth, and Rolef
Ben-Shahar et al. (2008) showed that Smc3 is acetylated in an
Eco1-dependent manner during DNA replication to promote sister chromatid
cohesion. A second set of eco1-1 suppressors inactivate the budding
yeast ortholog of the cohesin destabilizer Wapl. Rolef Ben-Shahar et al.
(2008) concluded that Eco1 modifies cohesin to stabilize sister
chromatid cohesion in parallel with a cohesion establishment reaction
that is in principle Eco1-independent.

Through single-molecule analysis, Terret et al. (2009) demonstrated that
a replication complex, the RFC-CTF18 clamp loader, controls the velocity
spacing and restart activity of replication forks in human cells and is
required for robust acetylation of cohesin's SMC3 subunit and sister
chromatid cohesion. Unexpectedly, Terret et al. (2009) discovered that
cohesin acetylation itself is a central determinant of fork
processivity, as slow-moving replication forks were found in cells
lacking the Eco1-related acetyltransferases ESCO1 or ESCO2 (609353)
(including those derived from Roberts syndrome (268300) patients, in
whom ESCO2 is biallelically mutated), and in cells expressing a form of
SMC3 that cannot be acetylated. This defect was a consequence of
cohesin's hyperstable interaction with 2 regulatory cofactors, WAPL and
PDS5A (613200); removal of either cofactor allowed forks to progress
rapidly without ESCO1, ESCO2, or RFC-CTF18. Terret et al. (2009)
concluded that their results showed a novel mechanism for clamp
loader-dependent fork progression, mediated by the posttranslational
modification and structural remodeling of the cohesin ring. Loss of this
regulatory mechanism leads to the spontaneous accrual of DNA damage and
may contribute to the abnormalities of the Roberts syndrome
cohesinopathy.

Using HeLa cells and Xenopus oocytes, Nishiyama et al. (2010) showed
that the function of WAPL in destabilizing chromosome cohesion was
countered by sororin (CDCA5; 609374), which functioned to maintain
sister chromatid cohesion. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that
sororin interacted with PDS5 and displaced WAPL from its interaction
with PDS5. Nishiyama et al. (2010) concluded that sororin maintains
sister chromatid cohesion by inhibiting WAPL-induced dissociation of
cohesin from DNA.

Using conditional mutagenesis in the mouse, Tedeschi et al. (2013)
demonstrated that depletion of the cohesin-associated protein Wapl
stably locks cohesin on DNA, leads to clustering of cohesin in axial
structures, and causes chromatin condensation in interphase chromosomes.
The findings revealed that the stability of cohesin-DNA interactions is
an important determinant of chromatin structure and indicated that
cohesin has an architectural role in interphase chromosome territories.
Tedeschi et al. (2013) also showed that regulation of cohesin-DNA
interactions by Wapl is important for embryonic development, expression
of genes such as c-myc, and cell cycle progression. In mitosis,
Wapl-mediated release of cohensin from DNA is essential for proper
chromosome segregation and protects cohesin from cleavage by the
protease separase, thus enabling mitotic exit in the presence of
functional cohesin complexes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kwiatkowski et al. (2004) determined that the WAPAL gene contains 21
exons and spans 90 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the WAPAL gene
to chromosome 10. By genomic sequence analysis, Kwiatkowski et al.
(2004) mapped the WAPAL gene to chromosome 10q23.2.

ANIMAL MODEL

Oikawa et al. (2004) showed that WAPL-transfected NIH3T3 cells induced
tumors in nude mice and concluded that WAPL has oncogenic
characteristics. Oikawa et al. (2004) stated that Wapl-deficient mice
displayed embryonic lethality.

Kuroda et al. (2005) showed that the dioxin TCDD induced Wapl expression
in Ahr (600253) -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Higher levels of TCDD
decreased Wapl levels in Ahr +/+ cells, but further increased Wapl
levels in Ahr -/- cells. Following a single peritoneal injection of TCDD
into male C57/BL6 mice, the authors analyzed testes samples and found
decreased levels of Wapl expression, suggesting that Wapl may be a
target gene mediating the reproductive toxicity of TCDD.

147572	TITLE *147572 INTERFERON-ALPHA-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN 6; IFI6
;;INTERFERON-INDUCED PROTEIN IFI-6-16; IFI616;;
G1P3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential screening of an alpha-interferon (IFNA; 147660)-induced
neuroblastoma cell cDNA library, followed by screening an IFNA-treated
Daudi lymphoblastoid cell cDNA library, Kelly et al. (1986) cloned IFI6,
which they called 6-16. The deduced 130-amino acid protein is
hydrophobic and contains an N-terminal signal peptide.

GENE FUNCTION

Kelly et al. (1986) showed that IFI6 was induced in HeLa cells by IFNA
and IFNB (147640). Following transfection in mouse cells, human IFI6 was
expressed in response to mouse Ifna and Ifnb, but not Ifng (147570),
with the same kinetics and dose response as in human cells.

Itzhaki and Porter (1991) reported a method for targeted disruption of
the IFI6 gene and detection by secretion of human growth hormone (GH1;
139250).

Cheriyath et al. (2007) showed that treatment of human myeloma cells
with IFN-alpha-2b (see IFNA2; 147562) for 24 hours antagonized TRAIL
(TNFSF10; 603598)-mediated apoptosis, but after 72 hours it augmented
TRAIL apoptotic activity. The antiapoptotic activity of IFN-alpha-2b was
associated with increased expression of G1P3. Ectopically expressed G1P3
localized to mitochondria and antagonized TRAIL-mediated mitochondrial
potential loss, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. Conversely, RNA
interference-mediated downregulation of G1P3 restored
IFN-alpha-2b-induced apoptosis. Cheriyath et al. (2007) concluded that
curtailing G1P3-mediated antiapoptotic signals may improve therapies for
myeloma and other malignancies.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kelly et al. (1986) determined that the IFI6 gene contains 5 exons and
has a TATA box upstream of the transcription initiation site.

Porter et al. (1988) described the interferon response element of the
human IFI6 gene.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Clauss et al. (1990) mapped the IFI6
gene to chromosome 1.

Itzhaki et al. (1992) reported that the IFI6 gene maps to chromosome
1p35, based on the work of others using fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Itzhaki et al. (1992) used telomere-associated chromosome
fragmentation (TACF), a novel approach for chromosome mapping based on
the nontargeted introduction of clone telomeres into mammalian
chromosomes, to target telomeric DNA to the IFI6 gene on chromosome 1p.
They deduced that the IFI6 gene is oriented away from the centromere by
targeting telomeric DNA to the specific locus by homologous
recombination, using a selection strategy that imposed the requirement
that the telomeric DNA be oriented in the same direction as the IFI6
gene.

191060	TITLE *191060 TRYPTOPHAN HYDROXYLASE 1; TPH1
;;TPH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH; EC 1.14.16.4) catalyzes the
biopterin-dependent monooxygenation of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan
(5HT), which is subsequently decarboxylated to form the neurotransmitter
serotonin. It is thus the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of
serotonin. TPH expression is limited to a few specialized tissues: raphe
neurons, pinealocytes, mast cells, mononuclear leukocytes, beta-cells of
the islets of Langerhans, and intestinal and pancreatic enterochromaffin
cells.

CLONING

Stoll et al. (1990) isolated a cDNA for tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph)
from a library constructed from RNA prepared from a mouse mastocytoma
cell line. Boularand et al. (1990) gave the sequence of a cDNA clone
containing the complete coding sequence of TPH.

GENE FUNCTION

Matsuda et al. (2004) found that mouse mammary glands stimulated by
prolactin (176760) expressed genes essential for serotonin biosynthesis,
including Tph. Tph mRNA was elevated during pregnancy and lactation, and
serotonin was detected in the mammary epithelium and in milk. Tph was
induced by prolactin in mammosphere cultures and by milk stasis in
nursing dams, suggesting that expression of TPH is controlled by milk
filling in the alveoli. Serotonin suppressed beta-casein (115460)
expression and caused shrinkage of mammary alveoli. Conversely,
disruption of the Tph gene or antiserotonergic drugs enhanced secretory
features and alveolar dilation. Matsuda et al. (2004) concluded that
autocrine-paracrine serotonin signaling is an important regulator of
mammary homeostasis and early involution.

The liver can regenerate its volume after major tissue loss. Lesurtel et
al. (2006) showed that in a mouse model of liver regeneration,
thrombocytopenia resulted in the failure to initiate cellular
proliferation in the liver. Platelets are major carriers of serotonin in
the blood. In thrombocytopenic mice, a serotonin agonist reconstituted
liver proliferation. The expression of 5-HT2A (182135) and 2B (601122)
subtype serotonin receptors in the liver increased after hepatectomy.
Antagonists of 5-HT2A and 2B receptors inhibited liver regeneration.
Liver regeneration was also blunted in mice lacking TPH1, which is the
rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of peripheral serotonin. This
failure of regeneration was rescued by reloading serotonin-free
platelets with a serotonin precursor molecule. Lesurtel et al. (2006)
concluded that platelet-derived serotonin is involved in the initiation
of liver regeneration.

Loss- and gain-of-function mutations in mouse Lrp5 (603506) affect bone
formation, causing osteoporosis and high bone mass, respectively. Yadav
et al. (2008) identified Tph1 as the most highly overexpressed gene in
Lrp5 -/- mice. Tph1 expression was also elevated in Lrp5 -/- duodenal
cells, its primary site of expression. Decreasing serotonin blood levels
normalized bone formation and bone mass in Lrp5 -/- mice, and
gut-specific Lrp5 inactivation decreased bone formation in a
beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)-independent manner. Moreover, gut-specific
activation of Lrp5 or inactivation of Tph1 increased bone mass and
prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice. Yadav et al. (2008)
showed that serotonin determined the extent of bone formation by binding
its receptor, Htr1b (182131), on osteoblasts and limiting osteoblast
proliferation by inhibiting Creb (see 123810)-mediated cyclin D1 (CCND1;
168461) expression. Yadav et al. (2008) concluded that LRP5 inhibits
bone formation by inhibiting serotonin production.

To examine putative central and peripheral sources of embryonic brain
5-HT (serotonin), Bonnin et al. (2011) used Pet1 (FEV; 607150)-null mice
in which most dorsal raphe neurons lack 5-HT. They detected previously
unknown differences in accumulation of 5-HT between the forebrain and
hindbrain during early and late fetal stages, through an exogenous
source of 5-HT which is not of maternal origin. Using additional genetic
strategies, a new technology for studying placental biology ex vivo and
direct manipulation of placental neosynthesis, Bonnin et al. (2011)
investigated the nature of this exogenous source and uncovered a
placental 5-HT synthetic pathway from a maternal tryptophan precursor in
both mice and humans. The mouse placenta expresses both Tph1 and Aadc
(608643) in the syncytiotrophoblastic cell layer at embryonic days 10.5
through 14.5. Human placental fetal villi at 11 weeks' gestation showed
robust 5-HT neosynthesis, indicating that a placental source of 5-HT is
important for human fetal development. Bonnin et al. (2011) concluded
that their study revealed a new, direct role for placental metabolic
pathways in modulating fetal brain development and indicated that
maternal-placental-fetal interactions could underlie the pronounced
impact of 5-HT on long-lasting mental health outcomes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gizatullin et al. (2006) noted that the TPH1 gene spans 29 kb and
contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

Using a clone for rabbit tryptophan hydroxylase as a probe in the study
of a panel of hamster-human somatic cell hybrids, Ledley et al. (1987)
assigned the gene to chromosome 11. They discussed the evolution of the
aromatic amino acid hydroxylase superfamily, which also includes TH
(191290), located at 11p15.5, and phenylalanine hydroxylase (612349),
located at 12q24.1. The locations of these genes and their evolutionary
distance (as indicated by their sequences) suggested to Ledley et al.
(1987) that at least 3 distinct genetic events have occurred during the
evolution of this superfamily: 2 sequential gene duplications giving
rise to 3 distinct loci, and a translocation which separated the
tryptophan and tyrosine hydroxylase loci on chromosome 11 from the
phenylalanine hydroxylase locus on chromosome 12. HGM9 regionalized the
assignment to 11p15-p13. Craig et al. (1991) regionalized the assignment
to 11p15.3-p14 by in situ hybridization.

By examining introns of the human TPH gene by PCR amplification and
analysis by the single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)
technique, Nielsen et al. (1992) identified an informative intronic
polymorphism useful in linkage studies. Using this polymorphism in 24
informative CEPH families, they showed that TPH lies between D11S151 and
D11S134.

Stoll et al. (1990) mapped the mouse Tph gene by Southern blot analysis
of somatic cell hybrids and by an interspecific backcross to a position
in the proximal half of chromosome 7. Thus, this is another example of
homology of synteny between human chromosome 11 and mouse chromosome 7.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bellivier et al. (2004) conducted a metaanalysis of 9 association
studies (961 patients and 1,485 controls) of the relationship between
the A218C polymorphism of the TPH gene and suicidal behavior. A
significant association was observed between this polymorphism and
suicidal behavior using the fixed effect method (odds ratio, 1.62; 95%
CI, 1.26; 2.07) and in the random effect method (odds ratio = 1.61; CI,
1.11; 2.35). When 2 of the studies that deviated from the calculated
global effect were removed, significant association remained. A
dose-dependent effect of the A allele on the risk for suicidal behavior
was observed.

Stefulj et al. (2006) studied the TPH1 A218C polymorphism in 247 male
victims of violent suicide and 320 controls of Slavic (Croatian) origin,
with specific relation to age. The frequency of the CC genotype was
increased in victims aged 65 and older as compared to controls (p =
0.0126 and 0.0008, for comparison with age-specific and integral control
samples, respectively), while there was no difference between victims
under age 65 and controls. The authors suggested a possible combined
effect of the genetic factor and physiologic changes due to aging on the
predisposition to violent suicide.

In a metaanalysis of 34 case-control studies from 21 published articles
and an unpublished paper, Li and He (2006) found an overall association
between suicidal behavior and the TPH A779C/A218C polymorphisms. The A
allele was the risk allele for both polymorphisms, yielding an odds
ratio of 1.12 overall for carriers of both A alleles. Sand (2007)
commented that the report of Li and He (2006) used pooled populations,
pooled SNP frequencies, imprecise phenotypes, and redundant reports, and
questioned the finding of allelic association.

Gizatullin et al. (2006) screened TPH1 SNPs spanning over 23 kb
(promoter to exon 8) in 228 patients with major depression (608516) and
253 healthy control subjects. Several haplotypes were associated with
depression, and the 6-SNP haplotypes that occurred in less than 5% of
both groups were associated with the disease (31.6% vs 18.0% in
controls, p less than 0.00005). A sliding window analysis attributed the
strongest disease association to a 2-SNP haplotype comprising dbSNP
rs1799913 (A779C) and dbSNP rs7933505 localized between intron 7 and 8
(p less than 0.00005). Gizatullin et al. (2006) concluded that the most
common variants appear not to carry risk while some less frequent
variants might contribute to major depression.

Li et al. (2006) examined the relationship between the A218C and A-6526G
polymorphisms of the TPH1 gene and attention deficit-hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD; 143465) in the Chinese Han population; 362 unrelated
ADHD probands and their biologic parents were studied. No biased
transmission of any allele of the 2 polymorphisms was associated by
transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) analysis. However, haplotype
analysis showed that the rare 218A/-6526G haplotype was significantly
not transmitted to probands with ADHD (chi square = 4.4995, p = 0.034),
regardless of subtype.

Allen et al. (2008) performed a metaanalysis across all ancestries
comparing 829 patients with schizophrenia with 1,268 controls and found
that the A versus C allele at position 218 in intron 7 (dbSNP rs1800532)
of the TPH1 gene was associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia
(OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.15-1.51; p less than 8(-5)). According to the
Venice guidelines for the assessment of cumulative evidence in genetic
association studies (Ioannidis et al., 2008), the TPH1 association
showed a 'strong' degree of epidemiologic credibility.

ANIMAL MODEL

Walther et al. (2003) developed Tph-null mice. Mutant mice showed no
significant differences in 5HT-related behaviors and expressed normal
amounts of 5HT in classical serotonergic brain regions. However,
Tph-null mice lacked 5HT in the periphery, except for the duodenum.
Using RNAse protection assays, they determined that Tph2 (607478) is the
predominant isoform expressed in mouse brain.

Walther et al. (2003) found that mice selectively deficient in
peripheral Tph and serotonin exhibited impaired hemostasis, resulting in
a reduced risk of thrombosis and thromboembolism, although platelet
ultrastructure was not affected. While the aggregation of
serotonin-deficient platelets in vitro was apparently normal, their
adhesion in vivo was reduced due to reduced secretion of adhesive
alpha-granular proteins. Walther et al. (2003) showed that serotonin was
transamidated to small GTPases by transglutaminases (see TGM2; 190196)
during activation and aggregation of platelets, rendering these GTPases
constitutively active.

Using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in a Cd8 (see 186910)-positive
T cell-dependent mouse model of immunopathologic hepatitis, Lang et al.
(2008) showed that Tph1-deficient mice, but not wildtype mice,
normalized hepatic microcirculatory dysfunction, accelerated clearance
of virus from liver, and reduced Cd8-positive T cell-dependent liver
cell damage. In contrast, serotonin treatment of infected wildtype mice
delayed entry to liver of Cd8-positive T cells, delayed viral clearance,
and aggravated liver immunopathology. Lang et al. (2008) concluded that
vasoactive serotonin supports virus persistence in liver and aggravates
virus-induced immunopathology.

176991	TITLE *176991 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A5; S100A5
;;S100D
DESCRIPTION The S100 proteins are small calcium-binding proteins which display
different expression patterns in human tissues. Some S100 proteins are
associated with tumor development and the metastatic behavior of tumors.
Engelkamp et al. (1993) established the physical linkage of 6 S100 genes
by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing of 15 kb
containing the full coding region of 4 different S100 genes: S100E
(S100A3; 176992), CAPL (S100A4; 114210), S100D (S100A5), and calcyclin
(S100A6; 114110). Engelkamp et al. (1993) stated that 'this is the
tightest mammalian gene cluster discovered so far.' The cluster was
assigned to 1q21 by in situ hybridization. Two other S100 genes were
located within 450 kb: S100L (S100A2; 176993) and S100A (S100A1;
176940).

Schafer et al. (1995) isolated a YAC from 1q21 on which 9 different
genes coding for S100 calcium-binding proteins could be localized. The
clustered organization of S100 genes allowed introduction of a new
logical nomenclature based on their physical arrangement on the
chromosome, with S100A1 being closest to the telomere and S100A9
(123886) being closest to the centromere. In this nomenclature, S100D
became S100A5.

;;CD39 ANTIGEN; CD39;;
VASCULAR ATP DIPHOSPHOHYDROLASE; ATPDase;;
APYRASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Endothelial cells have the ability to regulate platelet activation, in
part by the surface expression of ATP diphosphohydrolase (ATPDase; EC
3.6.1.5). ATPDase hydrolyzes extracellular ATP and ADP to AMP, which is
further converted to adenosine by another enzyme, 5-prime nucleotidase.
ADP is a powerful agonist for platelet recruitment and adhesion;
adenosine is an antagonist of these processes. Kaczmarek et al. (1996)
demonstrated that CD39, a B-cell activation marker previously
characterized by Maliszewski et al. (1994), encodes vascular ATPDase.
They isolated the cDNA of human ATPDase/CD39 by RT-PCR using RNA from
human umbilical endothelial cells. They expressed this cDNA in COS-7
cells and confirmed that it is expressed on the cell surface, hydrolyzes
both ATP and ADP, and inhibits platelet aggregation. CD39 was found to
have both immunologic identity to, and functional characteristics of,
vascular ATPDase. By Northern blot analysis, Chadwick and Frischauf
(1998) found that CD39 is expressed as a major 3.2- and a minor 3.6-kb
mRNA in several tissues. Additional bands were observed in a few
tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Adrian et al. (2000) analyzed the expression of several purinergic
receptors, as well as CD39 and CD73 (NT5E; 129190), during
differentiation in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line. Granulocytic
differentiation was induced by dimethylsulfoxide, and a
monocytic/macrophage phenotype was induced by phorbol esters. CD39
expression was nearly undetectable in undifferentiated cells, but
differentiation to either granulocytic or monocytic cells caused a
strong increase in CD39 transcript. CD39 was moderately expressed in
normal blood leukocytes.

MAPPING

Gray et al. (1997) mapped the CD39 gene to a YAC contig of 10q24 between
the genes for CYP2C (see 124020) and DNTT (187410).

ANIMAL MODEL

CD39 has been considered an important inhibitor of platelet activation.
Unexpectedly, Enjyoji et al. (1999) found that Cd39-deficient mice had
prolonged bleeding times with minimally perturbed coagulation
parameters. Platelet interactions with injured mesenteric vasculature
were considerably reduced in vivo, and purified mutant platelets failed
to aggregate to standard agonists in vitro. This platelet hypofunction
was reversible and associated with purinergic type P2y1 receptor
(601167) desensitization. In keeping with deficient vascular protective
mechanisms, fibrin deposition was found at multiple organ sites in
Cd39-deficient mice and in transplanted cardiac grafts. The data
indicated the dual role for CD39 in modulating hemostasis and thrombotic
reactions.

Langerhans cells (LC) are members of the dendritic cell (DC) family of
antigen-presenting cells residing in the skin. Wolff and Winkelmann
(1967) established that LC can be simply identified with light, rather
than electron, microscopy using surface ATPase staining. Mizumoto et al.
(2002) established that LC from CD39 -/- mice are not able to hydrolyze
both ATP and ADP and that CD39 +/- mice have a diminished ability to
effect ATP and ADP hydrolysis compared to wildtype mice. Histochemical,
Northern, and Western blot analyses showed that CD39 is expressed in
epidermal DC but not keratinocyte cell lines. CD39-deficient mice have
amplified inflammatory responses to irritant chemicals, while
heterozygous mice have intermediate responses compared to wildtype mice.
On the other hand, CD39 -/- mice have similar responses to ultraviolet
radiation and attenuated responses to contact allergens compared to
heterozygotes and wildtype mice. Using a fluorescent contact allergen,
Mizumoto et al. (2002) showed that the mutant mice LC are functional in
their homing and phenotypic maturation but are less able to stimulate T
cells, indicating that CD39 expression is required for optimal
stimulation of hapten-reactive T cells in mice. CD39-deficient DC are
unresponsive to ATP and are susceptible to cell death after prolonged
exposure to ADP. Mizumoto et al. (2002) and Granstein (2002) proposed
that if keratinocyte release of ATP and ADP occurs in response to all
chemical irritants and if the magnitude of release correlates with the
potency of the irritant, measurement of this release may be a useful in
vitro method to assess the risk of cosmetics and other topical agents
instead of animal testing.

604098	TITLE *604098 SUPPRESSOR OF G2 ALLELE OF SKP1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SUGT1
;;SGT1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kitagawa et al. (1999) identified the S. cerevisiae SGT1 (suppressor of
G2 allele of SKP1) gene, which, like SKP1 (see 601434), is required for
both the G1/S and G2/M transitions in the cell cycle. The SGT1 protein
physically associates with the SKP1 protein and the SCF (SKP1/Cdc53/F
box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex (see 603134) and is required for
kinetochore function, where it serves as an activator of the Ctf13
protein. Kitagawa et al. (1999) also cloned the human homolog of the
yeast SGT1 gene. The yeast and human SGT1 proteins share 26% identity
and 30% similarity. Human SGT1 could perform the essential functions of
SGT1 in budding yeast, indicating that SGT1 function is conserved
throughout eukaryotes.

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the SUGT1 gene to chromosome 13q14.3 based on an
alignment of the SUGT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF132856) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;UPA RECEPTOR; UPAR;;
CD87 ANTIGEN; CD87
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor is a key molecule in
the regulation of cell-surface plasminogen activation and, as such,
plays an important role in many normal as well as pathologic processes.

CLONING

Min et al. (1992) cloned the cDNA for Mo3, an activation antigen
expressed by human monocytes and myelomonocytic cell lines after
stimulation by a variety of agents. Mo3 expression in vivo is associated
predominantly with macrophages in inflammatory sites. It is a highly
glycosylated protein of about 50 kD in monocytes where it is anchored to
the plasma membrane by glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. The
complete coding sequence of the cDNA was found to encode 335 amino acids
including a predicted signal peptide of 22 residues and a hydrophobic
C-terminal portion. A database search revealed that Mo3 is identical to
the human receptor for the urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA, or
PLAU; 191840).

GENE FUNCTION

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and biochemical analysis,
Sitrin et al. (2001) demonstrated that PLAUR is directly associated with
the carbohydrate-binding domain of SELL (153240) in the membrane of
neutrophils, an association analogous to that between PLAUR and beta-2
integrins (see 600065). Spectrofluorometric analysis indicated that
PLAUR-mediated calcium mobilization is SELL dependent.

Foca et al. (2000) demonstrated that UPAR mRNA levels correlated with
the invasive potential of endometrial carcinomas and showed a 33-fold
increase in UPAR mRNA levels in advanced clinical stage endometrial
tumors compared with normal endometrial tissue. Furthermore, the
increase in UPAR mRNA levels correlated linearly with the progression of
disease stage. Memarzadeh et al. (2002) examined whether UPAR protein
expression correlated with (1) the grade and stage of endometrial cancer
and (2) recurrence and mortality rate in patients with endometrial
cancer. Their ultimate goal was to determine whether UPAR protein could
be used as a prognostic marker in patients with endometrial cancer. They
found no expression of UPAR protein in 7 patients with benign neoplasia
of the endometrium. On the other hand, UPAR protein expression highly
correlated with stage of disease in endometrial cancer. Moreover, high
UPAR expression positively correlated with grade of disease. It also
correlated positively with rate of recurrence and mortality in patients
with endometrial cancer. Memarzadeh et al. (2002) concluded that UPAR is
a useful prognostic marker for biologically aggressive forms of
endometrial cancer.

In human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells, UPA stimulates
cell migration via a UPAR signaling complex containing TYK2 (176941) and
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see 601232). Kiian et al. (2003)
showed that association of TYK2 and PI3K with active GTP-bound forms of
both RHOA (ARHA; 165390) and RAC1 (602048), but not CDC42 (116952), as
well as phosphorylation of myosin light chain (see 160781), are
downstream events required for UPA/UPAR-directed migration.

Wang et al. (2004) found that both Klf4 (602253) and Upar were
predominantly expressed in luminal surface epithelial cells of the
colonic crypt in mice. Colon cells from Klf4-null mice showed a dramatic
reduction in Upar protein compared with wildtype mice. Conversely, KLF4
expression in human colon cancer cells increased the amount of UPAR
protein and mRNA. Mobility shift experiments and chromatin
immunoprecipitation showed that KLF4 bound multiple regions of the UPAR
promoter.

Park et al. (2009) found that macrophages from Upar -/- mice had
enhanced ability to engulf wildtype neutrophils, but not Upar -/-
neutrophils. The enhanced phagocytic activity of Upar -/- macrophages
could be abrogated by incubation with soluble Upar, arg-gly-asp
peptides, or anti-integrin antibodies. Similarly, wildtype macrophages
showed increased uptake of Upar -/- neutrophils, except in the presence
of soluble Upar or anti-integrin antibodies. Incubation of either Upar
-/- neutrophils or Upar -/- macrophages, but not both, with soluble Upar
enhanced the uptake of Upar -/- neutrophils by Upar -/- macrophages.
Upar expression was reduced on the surface of apoptotic neutrophils
compared with viable neutrophils. Park et al. (2009) concluded that UPAR
is involved in the recognition and clearance of neutrophils.

- Role in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis

Using quantitative RT-PCR with glomeruli isolated from human kidney
biopsies, Wei et al. (2008) found that expression of UPAR was low in
healthy glomeruli, but it was induced in glomeruli from individuals with
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS; see 603278) and highly induced
in glomeruli from individuals with diabetic nephropathy. In all rat and
mouse models of proteinuria, Upar protein expression was increased in
glomerular cells, including podocytes, compared with controls.
Immunoelectron microscopy detected homogeneous distribution of Upar in
normal rat podocytes and mesangial and endothelial cells. However,
diabetic rats showed increased Upar labeling in all cells of the
glomerular tuft and increased podocyte Upar expression in basal
membranes of the foot process. Mice lacking Upar were protected from
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated proteinuria, but they developed
disease after expression of constitutively active beta-3 integrin
(ITGB3; 173470). Gene transfer studies revealed a prerequisite for Upar
expression in podocytes, but not in endothelial cells, for development
of LPS-mediated proteinuria. Upar was required to activate alpha-V
(ITGAV; 193210)/beta-3 integrin in podocytes, promoting cell motility
and activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 (116952) and Rac1 (602048).
Blockade of alpha-5/beta-3 integrin reduced podocyte motility in vitro
and lowered proteinuria in mice. Wei et al. (2008) concluded that UPAR
has a role in regulating renal permeability.

Wei et al. (2011) identified secreted PLAUR as a circulating factor
responsible for the development of FSGS. Levels of serum soluble PLAUR
were increased in two-thirds of patients with FSGS, but not in patients
with other glomerular disease. A higher serum concentration of PLAUR
before kidney transplantation was associated with an increased risk for
recurrence of FSGS after transplantation. Immunohistochemical studies on
human kidney samples derived from patients with FSGS demonstrated that
soluble PLAUR binds to and activates beta-3 integrin. In mouse models,
Plaur activated podocyte beta-3 integrin in both native and grafted
kidneys, causing foot process effacement, proteinuria, and FSGS-like
glomerulopathy. The findings suggested that renal disease only develops
when Plaur sufficiently activates podocyte beta-3-integrin. Inhibition
of PLAUR resulted in a reduction of beta-integrin activity in podocytes,
and plasmapheresis in humans reduced serum PLAUR concentrations in some
patients with increased levels. Wei et al. (2011) concluded that
pharmacologic modulation of excessive podocyte beta-3 integrin
activation may be a target for management of this form of renal disease.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Huai et al. (2006) reported the crystal structure at 1.9 angstroms of
the urokinase receptor complexed with the urokinase amino-terminal
fragment and antibody against the receptor. The 3 domains of the
urokinase receptor form a concave shape with a central cone-shaped
cavity where the urokinase fragment inserts. Huai et al. (2006)
concluded that the structure provides insight into the flexibility of
the urokinase receptor that enables its interaction with a wide variety
of ligands and a basis for the design of urokinase-urokinase receptor
antagonists.

MAPPING

By hybridization of a cDNA probe to DNAs from a panel of somatic cell
hybrids, Borglum et al. (1991, 1992) mapped the gene for the
urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor to 19q13-qter. Using RFLPs
related to the clone, they did linkage studies in 40 CEPH families and
demonstrated localization in the 19q13.1-q13.2 region. By in situ
hybridization, Vagnarelli et al. (1992) localized the PLAUR gene to
19q13.

ANIMAL MODEL

Powell et al. (2001) reported that Plaur knockout mice (Dewerchin et al.
(1996)) exhibit deficient scatter activity in the forebrain, abnormal
interneuron migration from the ganglionic eminence, and reduced
interneurons in the frontal and parietal cortex. Using immunoblots and
scatter assays, they concluded that the forebrain of Plaur knockout mice
has reduced levels of biologically active HGF (142409).

Stimulation with either gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria induces
upregulation of UPAR on monocytes and neutrophils. In general,
gram-negative bacterial stimuli require the beta-2 integrin CD11B/CD18B
for neutrophil emigration, whereas gram-positive bacteria do not.
Rijneveld et al. (2002) generated mice deficient in Upa or Upar.
Intranasal exposure to a beta-2 integrin-dependent pathogen,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, resulted in locally elevated levels of Upa in
wildtype mouse lungs. In Upar -/- mice, there was less granulocyte
accumulation but more bacteria in lungs, as well as reduced survival,
compared with wildtype mice. In contrast, Upa -/- mice manifested
increased neutrophil influx and fewer pneumococci in the lungs.
Rijneveld et al. (2002) concluded that UPAR is necessary for adequate
neutrophil recruitment into alveoli and lungs during pneumonia caused by
S. pneumoniae.

194558	TITLE *194558 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 83; ZNF83
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Marine et al. (1994) assigned the ZNF83 gene (also known as HPF1) to
chromosome 19 by screening a human/rodent hybrid panel and localized the
gene further to 19q13.3-q13.4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and
digital imaging microscopy.

HISTORY

Conserved structural motifs define large families of nucleic acid
binding proteins in eukaryotes. The C2H2-type zinc finger motif,
conferring both specific RNA and DNA binding activities, was first
detected within the amino acid sequence of the Xenopus transcription
factor IIIA (Miller et al., 1985). Thereafter, vertebrate genomes were
shown to encode hundreds of so-called zinc finger proteins (ZFPs).
Subfamilies were defined on the basis of conserved sequence elements
outside the finger repeat, such as the KRAB domain. Several members of
these subfamilies were found to have a clustered genomic organization.

611432	TITLE *611432 DEDICATOR OF CYTOKINESIS 8; DOCK8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DOCK8 is a member of the DOCK180-related (DOCK1; 601403) protein family
(Ruusala and Aspenstrom, 2004).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using CDC42 (116952) as bait, followed by PCR
of a Daudi cell cDNA library, Ruusala and Aspenstrom (2004) cloned
DOCK8. They identified transcripts encoding a 1,701-amino acid protein
with a calculated molecular mass of 190 kD and a 2,031-amino acid
protein. DOCK8 contains the CZH1 and CZH2 domains characteristic of
DOCK180-related proteins and shares 58% amino acid identity with DOCK7.
Northern blot analysis detected an 8-kb transcript in placenta, lung,
kidney, and pancreas with low expression in heart, brain, and skeletal
muscle and a 9-kb transcript with very low expression in placenta, lung,
and kidney. Immunofluorescence localized transiently transfected and
endogenous DOCK8 to the cytoplasm at cell edges in areas undergoing
lamellipodia formation, which increased when cells were treated with
PDGF (see 190040) or fetal calf serum. Transient transfection of a
C-terminal fragment of DOCK8 resulted in formation of vesicular
structures, which also contained filamentous actin, suggesting that
DOCK8 may play a role in the organization of filamentous actin.

By Northern blot analysis of human adult and fetal tissues, Griggs et
al. (2008) detected expression of an 8.0-kb transcript in all tissues
examined, including adult and fetal brain with variable expression in
specific brain regions tested. RT-PCR analysis detected variable
expression of a splice variant containing exon 13a and 14a and a splice
variant containing exon 13b but lacking exon 16.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Ruusala and Aspenstrom (2004) showed that
DOCK8 interacted with GTP- and GDP-bound forms of CDC42, Rac1 (602048)
mutants L61 and N17, and RHOJ (607653) and RHOQ (605857). None of these
interactions was detected using GST pull-down assay, suggesting that the
interaction between DOCK and Rho GTPases may be too transient to allow
stable interaction in this assay.

By quantitative RT-PCR analysis, Zhang et al. (2009) identified DOCK8
expression in monocytes, B cells, and T cells from healthy blood donors.
High levels were found in activated, expanded primary T-cell cultures
and transformed lymphocyte lines.

GENE STRUCTURE

Griggs et al. (2008) determined that the DOCK8 gene contains 47 exons
spanning 190 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Griggs et al. (2008) mapped the DOCK8 gene
to chromosome 9p24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Dominant Mental Retardation 2

Griggs et al. (2008) reported 2 unrelated patients with mental
retardation and developmental disability (MRD2; 614113) associated with
heterozygous disruption of the DOCK8 gene by deletion and by a
translocation breakpoint, respectively. Mapping of the critical region
shared by the 2 patients showed truncation of the longest isoform of
DOCK8. One patient was a 55-year-old man with profound mental
retardation, no speech, mild dysmorphic features, a history of seizures,
and stooped posture. He had a genomic deletion of approximately 230 kb
in subtelomeric 9p. The second patient was a girl with anhidrotic
ectodermal dysplasia (ED1; 305100) previously reported by MacDermot and
Hulten (1990). She carried a de novo balanced translocation
t(X;9)(q13.1;p24), which also interrupted the EDA gene (300451). She was
reported to have delayed speech and psychomotor development, but
attended a special school.

- Autosomal Recessive Hyper-IgE Recurrent Infection Syndrome

In 11 affected individuals from 8 unrelated families with autosomal
recessive hyper-IgE syndrome with recurrent infections (243700), Zhang
et al. (2009) identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for
deletions or mutations in the DOCK8 gene (see, e.g.,
611432.0001-611432.0005). Patients had recurrent and severe bacterial,
viral, and fungal infections, atopic dermatitis, and food and
environmental allergies. Several developed viral-associated carcinomas.
Laboratory studies showed decreased levels of T cells, variable decrease
in B cells, and increased serum IgE. All the DOCK8 mutations resulted in
loss of protein function. DOCK8 protein was not detected in primary T
cell cultures or transformed lymphocyte lines from all 11 patients
tested. CD8 T cells showed impaired proliferation and activation, with
normal cytotoxic activity.

homozygous 1214A-G transition in the DOCK8 gene, resulting in a
lys405-to-arg (K405R) substitution. The patients had atopic dermatitis,
recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, and multiple food and
environmental allergies. One died at age 18 years. Patient T-cell
cultures showed minimal amounts of a mutant protein, and CD8 T cells
showed poor expansion and activation. However, CD8 T cell cytotoxic

identified a homozygous large deletion (921_2765del) in the DOCK8 gene,
resulting in the deletion of exons 10 through 23. She had atopic
dermatitis, recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, and food
and environmental allergies. Patient T-cell cultures showed minimal
amounts of a truncated mutant protein, and CD8 T cells showed poor
expansion and activation. However, CD8 T cell cytotoxic function
appeared to be normal, and CD4 T cells showed normal proliferation.

the deletion of exons 5 through 24. He had atopic dermatitis, recurrent
bacterial and viral infections, and multiple food and environmental
allergies. He died of metastatic anal squamous cell carcinoma at age 21

604051	TITLE *604051 ENDO/EXONUCLEASE, ENDOG-LIKE; EXOG
;;ENDONUCLEASE G-LIKE 1; ENDOGL1;;
ENGL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EXOG is an endonuclease G (ENDOG; 600440)-like mitochondrial
endo/exonuclease that has both endonuclease and 5-prime-to-3-prime
exonuclease activities (Cymerman et al., 2008).

CLONING

By analysis of a 515-kb cloned segment from 3p22-p21.3, a region that is
commonly deleted in various carcinomas, Daigo et al. (1999) identified
10 genes, 4 of which were novel. They designated one of the novel genes
ENGL (endonuclease G-like) because the predicted 368-amino acid ENGL
protein shares 38% identity with endonuclease G (ENDOG; 600440).
Northern blot analysis revealed that ENGL was expressed as a 1.7-kb mRNA
in all tissues tested. An additional 2.1-kb mRNA, designated ENGLb, was
detected in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and testis. The ENGLb
transcript contained all or part of 4 of the 6 ENGL exons, as well as a
3-prime exon not present in the genomic clone analyzed.

Cymerman et al. (2008) reported that the 368-amino acid EXOG protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 41.1 kD. It contains an N-terminal
mitochondrial leader sequence (MLS), a central catalytic ser-arg-gly-his
(SRGH) motif, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. A predicted helical
transmembrane segment is located within the MLS. Confocal
immunohistochemical analysis revealed that EXOG localized to
mitochondria in HeLa cells. Mitochondrial subfractionation, immunogold
electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that
EXOG localized specifically to the inner mitochondrial membrane.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying transfected HEK293 cells, Cymerman et al. (2008) showed that
EXOG had high endonuclease activity against circular single-stranded
DNA. Recombinant EXOG lacking the N-terminal MLS showed a similar
preference for circular single-stranded DNA, but it also cleaved
super-coiled and open circular DNA after prolonged incubation. EXOG
showed 5-prime-to-3-prime exonuclease activity toward single- and
double-stranded DNA and single-stranded RNA. It showed little to no
endonuclease activity on ribosomal RNA substrates. Mutation of the
conserved his140 within the SRGH catalytic motif or removal of the
C-terminal coiled-coil domain abolished EXOG activity. Cymerman et al.
(2008) also found that a naturally occurring SNP resulting in a
gly277-to-val (G277V) substitution inactivated EXOG. Mutation analysis
showed that the transmembrane segment within the N-terminal MLS of EXOG
was required for EXOG mitochondrial localization.

GENE STRUCTURE

Daigo et al. (1999) determined that the EXOG gene contains 6 exons.
Cymerman et al. (2008) found that it spans 28.35 kb.

MAPPING

Daigo et al. (1999) identified the EXOG gene within a 515-kb cloned
segment from 3p22-p21.3. EXOG was the most telomeric gene in the cloned
region and was located next to the ActRIIB (ACVR2B; 602730) gene.
Cymerman et al. (2008) stated that the EXOG gene maps to chromosome
3p21.3.

612730	TITLE *612730 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 9 (SODIUM/HYDROGEN EXCHANGER), MEMBER 8; SLC9A8
;;SODIUM/HYDROGEN EXCHANGER 8; NHE8;;
KIAA0939
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sodium-hydrogen exchangers (NHEs), such as SLC9A8, are integral
transmembrane proteins that exchange extracellular Na+ for intracellular
H+. NHEs have multiple functions, including intracellular pH
homeostasis, cell volume regulation, and electroneutral NaCl absorption
in epithelia (Xu et al., 2008).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) obtained a partial SLC9A8 clone, which
they designated KIAA0939. RT-PCR ELISA detected low expression in most
adult tissues and specific brain regions examined. Little to no
expression was detected in adult lung and spleen and in fetal liver and
brain.

By searching databases using rabbit Nhe3 (SLC9A3; 182307) as query,
Goyal et al. (2003) identified human SLC9A8, which they called NHE8. The
full-length protein contains 581 amino acids and shares 96% identity
with mouse Nhe8. NHE8 has an N-terminal hydrophobic domain with 10 to 12
transmembrane segments and a short C-terminal hydrophilic tail. It also
has 4 potential N-glycosylation sites, a PKC-epsilon (PRKCE; 176975)
phosphorylation site, and putative SH2-, SH3-, ERK (see MAPK3; 601795)-,
and type III PDZ-binding domains. Northern blot analysis of mouse
tissues revealed ubiquitous expression, with highest levels in kidney,
testis, skeletal muscle, and liver. Western blot analysis detected Nhe8
in apical membranes purified from rat renal cortex. In situ
hybridization of rat kidney revealed high expression of Nhe8 in proximal
tubules in the outer stripe of the outer medulla, with lower expression
in cortical proximal tubules. No message was detected in glomeruli.

Using Northern blot analysis, Xu et al. (2008) detected 7- and 4-kb NHE8
transcripts in all sections of the human gastrointestinal tract, with
highest expression in stomach, duodenum, and ascending colon. Adult
mouse gastrointestinal tract showed a slightly different distribution of
Nhe8, and Nhe8 expression was much higher in stomach and jejunum of
young mice compared with adult mice.

By immunofluorescence analysis and immunogold electron microscopy of
HeLa cells, Lawrence et al. (2010) found that the majority of NHE8
localized to the trans-Golgi network, with a smaller proportion
localized with multivesicular bodies.

GENE FUNCTION

Xu et al. (2008) found that rat Nhe8 was a functional NHE with kinetics
and an inhibitor profile that differed from other apically expressed
NHEs.

Lawrence et al. (2010) found that knockdown of NHE8 in HeLa cells, but
not knockdown of any other NHE tested, resulted in endosomal clustering,
increased proportion of dense multivesicular bodies, and elevated EGF
(131530) degradation. Overexpression of an inactive NHE8 mutant resulted
in a similar endosomal phenotype. Depletion of NHE8 had no effect on
perinuclear localization of the trans-Golgi network, rate of protein
secretion, or endosomal pH.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the SLC9A8 gene to chromosome 20q13.13 based on an
alignment of the SLC9A8 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB023156) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

602661	TITLE *602661 TUBULIN, BETA-3; TUBB3
;;TUBB4;;
TUBULIN, BETA, CLASS III
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Microtubules are dynamic polymeric structures consisting of heterodimers
of alpha-tubulins (see 602529) and beta-tubulins, such as TUBB3, that
are continuously incorporated and released. Microtubules function in
mitosis, intracellular transport, neuron morphology, and ciliary and
flagellar motility (Leandro-Garcia et al., 2010).

CLONING

Sullivan and Cleveland (1986) isolated a partial TUBB3 cDNA, which they
designated beta-4, from a human placenta cDNA library. Ranganathan et
al. (1998) cloned cDNAs encoding human TUBB3 from a prostate carcinoma
cell line.

Wang et al. (1986) cloned mouse Tubb3, which they called M-beta-3, from
testis and bone marrow cDNA libraries. Northern blot analysis detected
abundant Tubb3 expression in testis, where expression began around
postnatal day 32. Much lower Tubb3 levels were detected in all other
adult mouse tissues examined except brain, where expression was even
lower.

Burgoyne et al. (1988) stated that the mouse homolog of human TUBB3,
M-beta-6, is expressed primarily in neural tissue.

By RT-PCR analysis of a human brain cDNA library, Poirier et al. (2010)
cloned TUBB3, which encodes a 450-amino acid protein. RT-PCR,
immunocytochemical, and Western blot analyses showed that TUBB3 was
significantly expressed in fibroblasts.

Using database analysis, Leandro-Garcia et al. (2010) identified 8 major
beta-tubulins, including TUBB3. Quantitative RT-PCR of 21 normal human
tissues detected highest TUBB3 expression in brain, much lower
expression in small intestine, testis, and placenta, and little to no
expression in other tissues.

MAPPING

Tischfield et al. (2010) noted that the TUBB3 gene maps to chromosome
16q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Antimicrotubule drugs are used in cancer chemotherapy. By RT-PCR and
Western blot analyses, Ranganathan et al. (1998) found that drug
treatment of prostate carcinoma cells selectively increased TUBB3 mRNA
and protein levels. In brain tumor cell lines, the amount of TUBB3
protein was positively correlated with resistance to an antimicrotubule
agent. Ranganathan et al. (1998) suggested that the selective increase
in TUBB3, an isotype that imparts more dynamicity to microtubules, may
provide a way for cells to overcome the effect of antimicrotubule
agents.

Hari et al. (2003) transfected beta III tubulin into Chinese hamster
ovary cells and demonstrated that beta III tubulin diminished
microtubule assembly in a dose-dependent manner and was toxic when
present at high levels. Cells expressing beta III tubulin at moderate
levels were weakly resistant to paclitaxel, a commonly used
chemotherapeutic agent.

Raspaglio et al. (2008) found that hypoxia induced TUBB3 expression in
several human cell lines, but not in a paclitaxel-resistant cell line.
RNA interference revealed that HIF1A (603348) mediated hypoxia-induced
TUBB3 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that
HIF1A bound an HIF1A-binding site in the 5-prime flanking region of the
TUBB3 gene. Methylation of an enhancer in the 3-prime flanking region
abolished hypoxia-induced TUBB3 expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Congenital Fibrosis of Extraocular Muscles 3A

Tischfield et al. (2010) identified 8 different heterozygous mutations
in the TUBB3 gene (see, e.g., 602661.0001-602661.0005) in affected
individuals with autosomal dominant or sporadic congenital fibrosis of
extraocular muscles type 3A with or without extraocular involvement
(CFEOM3A; 600638). In vitro functional expression studies, mutant mouse
studies, and yeast studies showed that all of the mutations resulted in
altered microtubule dynamics and stability, and some showed various loss
of kinesin microtubule interactions. Most affected individuals had
congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles, but some showed additional
defects, including developmental delay or learning disabilities
associated with dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. Other variable
features included facial weakness and peripheral axonal neuropathy,
sometimes associated with wrist and finger contractures. There were some
genotype/phenotype correlations: those with the E410K (602661.0005) and
D417H (602661.0003) mutations had a severe phenotype with additional
features, including facial weakness and learning disabilities, whereas
those with the D417N (602661.0004) mutation had peripheral neuropathy
and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and those with the common R262C
mutation (602661.0001) had the mildest phenotype. Overall, the findings
were consistent with defects in axonal guidance, suggesting that the
TUBB3 gene is critical for normal microtubule dynamics, axonal guidance,
and brain development.

- Complex Cortical Dysplasia With Other Brain Malformations
1

In affected members of 7 unrelated families with complex cortical
dysplasia with other brain malformations-1 (CDCBM1; 614039), Poirier et
al. (2010) identified 6 different heterozygous missense mutations in the
TUBB3 gene (see, e.g., 602661.0006-602661.0009). In vitro functional
expression studies showed that most of the mutations resulted in
impairment of the tubulin heterodimerization process or caused impaired
microtubule stability. Affected individuals had mild to severe mental
retardation, strabismus, axial hypotonia, and spasticity. Brain imaging
showed variable malformations of cortical development, including
polymicrogyria, gyral disorganization, and fusion of the basal ganglia,
as well as thin corpus callosum, hypoplastic brainstem, and dysplastic
cerebellar vermis. Extraocular muscles were not involved.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Three of the TUBB3 mutations identified by Poirier et al. (2010) in
patients with complex cortical dysplasia and other brain malformations
(G82R, T178M; 602661.0008, and M323V; 602661.0009) were localized to the
surface of the tubulin molecule, on the opposite side of TUBB3 mutations
reported by Tischfield et al. (2010) (R262C; 602661.0001, E410K;
602661.0005, and D417N; 602661.0004), suggesting that these 2 groups of
mutations could impair microtubules and/or their interactions with
proteins critical for microtubule function in different ways. Mutations
associated with different phenotypes might reside in different
functional areas of the protein. However, in the specific case of the
ala302 residue, the nature of the variation seemed to influence the
resulting phenotype, since the A302T (602661.0002) and A302V
(602661.0008) mutations resulted in CFEOM3A and CDCBM syndromes,
respectively.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tischfield et al. (2010) showed that heterozygous mice carrying the
R262C mutation (602661.0001) appeared healthy and had no external eye
phenotypes. Homozygous mice failed to breathe normally and died within
hours of birth. Homozygous mice showed defects in the guidance of
commissural axons and cranial nerves, and some had agenesis of the
corpus callosum; heterozygous mice had thin anterior commissures. Both
homo- and heterozygous R262C mice had decreased levels of Tubb3 protein,
but the Tubb3 protein resulted in increased microtubule stability with
decreased Kif21a (608283) microtubule interactions.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FIBROSIS OF EXTRAOCULAR MUSCLES, CONGENITAL, 3A, WITH OR WITHOUT EXTRAOCULAR
INVOLVEMENT
TUBB3, ARG262CYS

In affected members of 11 unrelated pedigrees with congenital fibrosis
of extraocular muscles-3A (600638), Tischfield et al. (2010) identified
a heterozygous 784C-T transition in exon 4 of the TUBB3 gene, resulting
in an arg262-to-cys (R262C) substitution. Several of the pedigrees had
previously been reported by Doherty et al. (1999), Gillies et al.
(1995), Mackey et al. (2002), and Yamada et al. (2004). The ocular
motility defects ranged from severe to mild. Brain MRI of affected
members in 4 pedigrees showed hypoplasia of the oculomotor nerve and the
muscles innervated by its superior division, the levator palpebrae
superioris and superior rectus, as well as the medial rectus muscle
innervated by its inferior division. The oculomotor nerve also
aberrantly innervated the lateral rectus muscle, normally innervated by
the abducens nerve. The findings were consistent with axon guidance
defects. In addition, affected individuals in some of the families
showed developmental delay or learning disabilities, and some had mild
dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. In vitro studies showed patchy mutant
heterodimer incorporation into microtubules. Further studies showed
decreased polymerization rates and increased depolymerization rates, as
well as altered interaction with kinesins. The mutation was not found in
over 1,700 control chromosomes.

.0002
FIBROSIS OF EXTRAOCULAR MUSCLES, CONGENITAL, 3A, WITH OR WITHOUT EXTRAOCULAR
INVOLVEMENT
TUBB3, ALA302THR

In affected members of 3 unrelated pedigrees with congenital fibrosis of
extraocular muscles-3A (600638), Tischfield et al. (2010) identified a
heterozygous 904G-A transition in exon 4 of the TUBB3 gene, resulting in
an ala302-to-thr (A302T) substitution in a region proposed to mediate
lateral interactions between tubulin heterodimers, which assemble to
form microtubules. Two affected individuals in 1 of the families showed
learning disabilities and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the A302T mutant incorporated
into microtubules, increased the stability of microtubules, and
diminished overall microtubule dynamics. The mutation was not found in
over 1,700 control chromosomes.

Notably, a mutation affecting the same residue, A302V (602661.0008), was
identified as causative of complex cortical dysplasia and other brain
malformations (614039) (Poirier et al., 2010).

.0003
FIBROSIS OF EXTRAOCULAR MUSCLES, CONGENITAL, 3A, WITH OR WITHOUT EXTRAOCULAR
INVOLVEMENT
TUBB3, ASP417HIS

In a mother and 2 sons with CFEOM3A (600638), Tischfield et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous 1249G-C transversion in the TUBB3 gene,
resulting in an asp417-to-his (D417H) substitution in a region on the
external surface of microtubules that mediate interactions with motor
proteins and other proteins. Other clinical features included facial
weakness, wrist and finger contractures, peripheral axonal neuropathy in
2, and developmental delay in 1. Brain imaging was not performed. In
vitro functional expression studies in yeast showed that the mutation
resulted in altered kinesin microtubule interactions. The mutation was
not found in over 1,700 control chromosomes. Another mutation in this
residue was also identified (D417N; 602661.0004).

.0004
FIBROSIS OF EXTRAOCULAR MUSCLES, CONGENITAL, 3A, WITH OR WITHOUT EXTRAOCULAR
INVOLVEMENT
TUBB3, ASP417ASN

In affected members of 4 unrelated pedigrees with CFEOM3A (600638),
Tischfield et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 1249G-A transition in
exon 4 of the TUBB3 gene, resulting in an asp417-to-asn (D417N)
substitution in a region on the external surface of microtubules that
mediate interactions with motor proteins and other proteins. Affected
members of 2 families had isolated CFEOM, but affected members in the
other 2 families also developed axonal peripheral neuropathy in the
second to third decade. One Belgian family, previously reported by
Abeloos et al. (1990), had 9 affected individuals, 4 of whom also had
developmental delay or learning disabilities. Five mutation carriers in
this family had peripheral neuropathy in the absence of CFEOM. In vitro
functional expression studies in yeast showed that the mutation resulted
in altered kinesin microtubule interactions. The mutation was not found
in over 1,700 control chromosomes. Another mutation in this residue was
also identified (D417H; 602661.0003).

.0005
FIBROSIS OF EXTRAOCULAR MUSCLES, CONGENITAL, 3A, WITH OR WITHOUT EXTRAOCULAR
INVOLVEMENT
TUBB3, GLU410LYS

In 6 unrelated individuals with sporadic CFEOM3A (600638), Tischfield et
al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 1228G-A transition in exon 4 of the
TUBB3 gene, resulting in a glu410-to-lys (E410K) substitution in a
region on the external surface of microtubules that mediate interactions
with motor proteins and other proteins. All of the mutations appeared to
be de novo. In addition to CFEOM, all individuals had developmental
delay and facial weakness. Some had agenesis of the corpus callosum on
brain MRI. One also had peripheral neuropathy with wrist and finger
contractures. In vitro functional expression studies and yeast studies
showed that the mutation resulted in decreased polymerization rates and
increased depolymerization rates, as well as altered kinesin microtubule
interactions. The mutation was not found in over 1,700 control
chromosomes.

.0006
CORTICAL DYSPLASIA, COMPLEX, WITH OTHER BRAIN MALFORMATIONS 1
TUBB3, THR178MET

In a patient with complex cortical dysplasia and other brain
malformations-1 (CDCBM1; 614039), Poirier et al. (2010) identified a de
novo heterozygous c.533C-T transition in exon 4 of the TUBB3 gene,
resulting in a thr178-to-met (T178M) substitution in the N-terminal
domain. The mutation was not detected in 360 Caucasian controls. Protein
modeling showed that the mutation localized to the surface of the
alpha-beta tubulin heterodimer. Structural data suggested that the
mutation may influence GTP binding. In vitro functional expression
assays showed that the mutant protein was translated and could form
tubulin heterodimers that were properly incorporated into microtubules,
although the microtubules were less stable than wildtype. The patient
had microcephaly, virtually no psychomotor development, axial hypotonia,
spastic tetraplegia, refractory epilepsy, cortical gyral
disorganization, hypoplasia of the cerebellum and brainstem, agenesis of
the corpus callosum, and fusion of the caudate and putamen.

.0007
CORTICAL DYSPLASIA, COMPLEX, WITH OTHER BRAIN MALFORMATIONS 1
TUBB3, GLU205LYS

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with complex cortical
dysplasia and other brain malformations-1 (614039), Poirier et al.
(2010) identified a heterozygous c.613G-A transition in exon 4 of the
TUBB3 gene, resulting in a glu205-to-lys (E205K) substitution in the
intermediate domain. The mutation occurred de novo in 1 family and was
inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in the other family. The
mutation was not detected in 360 Caucasian controls. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein did not form tubulin
heterodimers and had a subtle impairment in its ability to incorporate
into the cytoskeleton. Studies of patient fibroblasts showed no major
alterations in the microtubule network, but the microtubules were less
stable than wildtype. The patients had moderate to severe mental
retardation, polymicrogyria, dysplastic cerebellum, hypoplasia of the
brainstem, and fusion of the caudate and putamen.

.0008
CORTICAL DYSPLASIA, COMPLEX, WITH OTHER BRAIN MALFORMATIONS 1
TUBB3, ALA302VAL

In 4 affected members of a family with complex cortical dysplasia and
other brain malformations-1 (614039), Poirier et al. (2010) identified a
heterozygous c.905C-T transition in exon 4 of the TUBB3 gene, resulting
in an ala302-to-val (A302V) substitution in the intermediate domain. The
mutation was not detected in 360 Caucasian controls. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein did not form tubulin
heterodimers. The mother had mild mental retardation, gyral
disorganization, and dysplasia of the cerebellar vermis. One of her
daughters was homozygous for the mutation and had a more severe
phenotype with axial hypotonia, gyral disorganization, dysplastic
cerebellar vermis, hypoplastic brainstem, thin corpus callosum, and
fusion of the caudate and putamen.

Notably, a mutation affecting the same residue, A302T (602661.0002), had
been identified as causative of CFEOM3A (600638) (Tischfield et al.,
2010).

.0009
CORTICAL DYSPLASIA, COMPLEX, WITH OTHER BRAIN MALFORMATIONS 1
TUBB3, MET323VAL

In a father and son with complex cortical dysplasia and other brain
malformations-1 (614039), Poirier et al. (2010) identified a
heterozygous c.967A-G transition in exon 4 of the TUBB3 gene, resulting
in a met323-to-val (M323V) substitution in intermediate domain. Protein
modeling showed that the mutation localized to the surface of the
alpha-beta tubulin heterodimer. In vitro functional expression assays
showed that the mutant protein was translated, but generated diminished
levels of tubulin heterodimers. The patients had mental retardation,
gyral disorganization, dysplastic cerebellum, hypoplastic brainstem,
thin corpus callosum, and mild fusion of the basal ganglia.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Schall et al. (1990) isolated a cDNA corresponding to TNFR2 using
oligomer probes based on amino acid sequence from the purified protein.
The receptor encodes a predicted 415-amino acid polypeptide with a
single membrane-spanning domain and has an extracellular domain with
sequence similarity to nerve growth factor receptor (162010) and B-cell
activation protein Bp50 (164011). Recombinantly expressed receptor was
shown by Schall et al. (1990) to bind TNF-alpha (191160). Northern blots
showed expression in a variety of cell types.

GENE STRUCTURE

Beltinger et al. (1996) showed that TNFR2 contains 10 exons and spans
about 26 kb of genomic DNA. Most of the functional domains, including
the extracellular cysteine-rich motifs, occur in separate exons.
Overall, the gene structure is similar to that of TNFR1 (191190). On the
basis of a YAC contig for the region, they mapped TNFR2 to within 400 kb
of the marker D1S434 on 1p36.

Santee and Owen-Schaub (1996) characterized the complete gene structure
for human TNFR p75, which spans nearly 43 kb. The gene consists of 10
exons (ranging from 34 bp to 2.5 kb) and 9 introns (343 bp to 19 kb).
Consensus elements for transcription factors involved in T-cell
development and activation were noted in the putative promoter region.

GENE FUNCTION

TNFBR (TNFR75) is the larger of the 2 TNF receptors; see 191190. It is
present on many cell types, especially those of myeloid origin, and is
strongly expressed on stimulated T and B lymphocytes. Beltinger et al.
(1996) noted that TNFR2 is the main TNF receptor found on circulating T
cells and is the major mediator of autoregulatory apoptosis in CD8+
cells. TNFR2 may act with TNFR1 to kill nonlymphoid cells.

Preassembly or self-association of cytokine receptor dimers (e.g., IL1R,
see 147810; IL2R, 147730; and EPOR, 133171) occurs via the same amino
acid contacts that are critical for ligand binding. Chan et al. (2000)
found that, in contrast, the p60 (TNFRSF1A; 191190) and p80 (TNFRSF1B)
TNFA receptors self-assemble through a distinct functional domain in the
TNFR extracellular domain, termed the pre-ligand assembly domain (PLAD),
in the absence of ligand. Deletion of the PLAD results in monomeric
presentation of p60 or p80. Flow cytometric analysis showed that
efficient TNFA binding depends on receptor self-assembly. They also
found that other members of the TNF receptor superfamily, including the
extracellular domains of TRAIL (TNFRSF10A; 603611), CD40 (109535), and
FAS (TNFRSF6; 134637), all self-associate but do not interact with
heterologous receptors.

Using Jurkat T cells, which express TNFR1 but little TNFR2, and Jurkat
cells stably transfected with TNFR2, Li et al. (2002) confirmed that TNF
stimulation, or stimulation with a TNFR2, but not TNFR1, agonist, causes
a loss of TRAF2 (601895) in the TNFR2-expressing cells, but not the
parental cell line, through a ubiquitination- and proteasome-dependent
process. Binding analysis indicated that TRAF2 interacts with CIAP1
(601712) and CIAP2 (601721), which possess E3 ubiquitin ligase (e.g.
UBE3A, 601623) activity. Ubiquitination assays and SDS-PAGE analysis
showed that in the presence of an E2-conjugating enzyme (e.g., UBCH7,
603721), CIAP1, but not CIAP2, induces TRAF2 ubiquitination outside of
its RING domain. Both CIAPs bind but neither ubiquitinates TRAF1
(601711). CIAP1 expression fails to protect TNFR2-expressing cells from
TNF-induced apoptosis, whereas an E3-inactive CIAP1 mutant and wildtype
CIAP2 do protect cells from TRAF2 downregulation and cause a delay in
cell death. Li et al. (2002) concluded that TNFR2 stimulation causes the
ubiquitination of TRAF2 by CIAP1, which can play a proapoptotic role in
TNF signaling.

Tang et al. (2011) reported that PGRN (138945) bound directly to tumor
necrosis factor receptors (TNFR1 and TNRF2) and disturbed the TNFA-TNFR
interaction. Pgrn-deficient mice were susceptible to collagen-induced
arthritis, and administration of PGRN reversed inflammatory arthritis.
Atsttrin, an engineered protein composed of 3 PGRN fragments, exhibited
selective TNFR binding. PGRN and Atsttrin prevented inflammation in
multiple arthritis mouse models and inhibited TNFA-activated
intracellular signaling. Tang et al. (2011) concluded that PGRN is a
ligand of TNFR, an antagonist of TNFA signaling, and plays a critical
role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis in mice.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of human/Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrid
DNA, Milatovich et al. (1991) mapped the TNFR2 gene to 1pter-p32. By in
situ hybridization and Southern blot analysis of a series of human/mouse
hybrid cell lines, Baker et al. (1991) refined the assignment of TNFR2
to 1p36. By nonradioactive in situ hybridization, Kemper et al. (1991)
assigned the gene to 1p36.3-p36.2. Using an SSCP polymorphism of the
TNFR2 gene, Kaufman et al. (1994) demonstrated that TNFR2 is very
closely linked to the pronatriodilatin gene (108780).

White et al. (1995) showed that TNFR2 maps outside the region of
1p36.3-p36.2 thought by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies to contain
the neuroblastoma tumor suppressor locus (256700).

By linkage analysis, Santee and Owen Schaub (1996) confirmed the mapping
of the TNFR2 gene to 1p36.3-p36.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Glenn et al. (2000) tested markers in and near the TNFR2 gene for
linkage and association with hypertension (145500) as well as
hypercholesterolemia and plasma levels of the shed soluble receptor
(sTNF-R2). Using sib pair analysis, they reported a sharp, significant
linkage peak centered at TNFRSF1B (multipoint maximum lod score = 2.6
and 3.1 by weighted and unweighted MAPMAKER/SIBS, respectively). In a
case-control study, they demonstrated a possible association of TNFRSF1B
with hypertension by haplotype analysis. Plasma sTNF-R2 was
significantly elevated in hypertensives and showed a correlation with
systolic and diastolic blood pressure. A genotypic effect of TNFRSF1B on
plasma sTNF-R2, as well as total, low, and high density lipoprotein
cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure was also observed. The authors
proposed a scheme for involvement of TNF and its receptors in
hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.

Geurts et al. (2000) conducted a genomic scan in 18 Dutch familial
combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL; 144250) families and identified several
loci with evidence for linkage. Linear regression analysis using 79
independent sib pairs showed linkage with a quantitative FCHL
discriminant function and the intron 4 (CA)n polymorphism of TNFRSF1B (P
= 0.032), and a case-control study demonstrated an association as well
(P = 0.029). Mutation analysis of exon 6 in 73 FCHL family members
delineated 2 TNFRSF1B alleles, coding for methionine (196M) and arginine
(196R). Complete linkage disequilibrium between CA267, CA271, and CA273
and this polymorphism was detected. In 85 hyperlipidemic FCHL subjects,
an association was demonstrated between soluble TNFRSF1B plasma
concentrations and the CA271-196M haplotype. The authors concluded that
TNFRSF1B is associated with susceptibility to FCHL.

In Japan, Sashio et al. (2002) examined polymorphisms of the tumor
necrosis factor gene (TNFA; 191160) and the TNFRSF1B gene in patients
with inflammatory bowel disease (see IBD1, 266600), including 124 with
Crohn disease and 106 with ulcerative colitis, and 111 unrelated healthy
controls. They studied 2 SNPs: 1466A-G and 1493C-T. They found a
significant difference in carrier frequency for haplotype AT (1466A,
1493T) of the TNFRSF1B gene between Crohn disease patients and the
controls (odds ratio = 2.13). Significance proved to be greater in Crohn
disease patients with both internal and external fistula, and in those
who were poor responders to treatment, which consisted of nutritional,
medical, and surgical therapy.

Peral et al. (2002) evaluated serum soluble TNF receptor-2 levels, and
several common polymorphisms in the TNFRSF1B gene, in women presenting
with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; 184700) or hyperandrogenic
disorders. The 196R alleles of the M196R (676T-G) variant in exon 6 of
TNFRSF1B, which is in linkage disequilibrium with a CA repeat
microsatellite polymorphism in intron 4 of TNFRSF1B, tended to be more
frequent in hyperandrogenic patients than in controls (P = 0.056),
reaching statistical significance when the analysis was restricted to
include only PCOS patients (P less than 0.03). Extended analysis
including another 11 hyperandrogenic patients from Spain and 64 patients
and 29 controls from Italy confirmed the association between 196R
alleles of the M196R variant and hyperandrogenic disorders (P less than
0.05), which was maintained when restricting the analysis to PCOS
patients (P less than 0.02). On the contrary, the 3-prime-untranslated
region (exon 10) variants 1663G-A, 1668T-G, and 1690T-C were not
associated with hyperandrogenism. The authors concluded that the M196R
variant in exon 6 of TNFRSF1B is associated with hyperandrogenism and
PCOS, further suggesting a role for inflammatory cytokines in the
pathogenesis of these disorders.

One of the candidate loci for regulation of hip bone mineral density
(BMD) is on chromosome 1p36 (BMND3; 606928). Albagha et al. (2002)
studied several TNFRSF1B polymorphisms in a population-based cohort
study of 1,240 perimenopausal women from the UK. The authors found no
association between 676T-G (met196-to-arg) alleles and BMD at the spine
or hip. However, subjects homozygous for the A593-T598-C620 haplotype in
the 3-prime UTR region had femoral neck BMD values 5.7% lower than those
who did not carry the haplotype (P less than 0.0001). Regression
analysis showed that the ATC haplotype accounted for 1.2% of the
population variance in hip BMD and was the second strongest predictor
after body weight.

Xu et al. (2005) analyzed the (CA)n polymorphism in intron 4 of the
TNFRSF1B gene and BMD in 1,263 Chinese individuals from 402 nuclear
families composed of both parents and at least 1 daughter. Significant
within-family association was detected between the CA16 allele and BMD
at the lumbar spine (p = 0.005); about 3.14% of lumbar spine BMD
variation could be explained by the CA16 allele.

Fairfax et al. (2011) identified a haplotype marked by a SNP (dbSNP
rs522807) in the TNFR2 promoter that was strongly associated with
reduced tolerance to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The haplotype was
associated with increased expression of TNFR2, and basal TNFR2
expression was associated with secondary TNF release. Fairfax et al.
(2011) reported that the tolerance-associated ancestral allele of dbSNP
rs522807 is present at a frequency of 8% in northern Europeans, is
absent in Asians, and is present at a frequency of approximately 50% in
equatorial Africans.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bruce et al. (1996) used targeted gene disruption to generate mice
lacking either the p55 (TNFR1) or the p75 (TNFR2) TNF receptor; mice
lacking both p55 and p75 were generated from crosses of the singly
deficient mice. The TNFR-deficient (TNFR-KO) mice exhibited no overt
phenotype under unchallenged conditions. Bruce et al. (1996) reported
that damage to neurons caused by focal cerebral ischemia and epileptic
seizures was exacerbated in the TNFR-KO mice, indicating that TNF serves
a neuroprotective function. Their studies indicated that TNF protects
neurons by stimulating antioxidative pathways. Injury-induced microglial
activation was suppressed in TNFR-KO mice. They concluded that drugs
which target TNF signaling pathways may prove beneficial in treating
stroke or traumatic brain injury.

Vielhauer et al. (2005) studied immune complex-mediated
glomerulonephritis in Tnfr1- and Tnfr2-deficient mice. Proteinuria and
renal pathology were initially milder in Tnfr1-deficient mice, but at
later time points were similar to those in wildtype controls, with
excessive renal T-cell accumulation and reduced T-cell apoptosis. In
contrast, Tnfr2-deficient mice were completely protected from
glomerulonephritis at all time points, despite an intact immune system
response. Tnfr2 expression on intrinsic renal cells, but not leukocytes,
was essential for glomerulonephritis and glomerular complement
deposition. Vielhauer et al. (2005) concluded that the proinflammatory
and immunosuppressive properties of TNF segregate at the level of its
receptors, with TNFR1 promoting systemic immune responses and renal
T-cell death and intrinsic renal cell TNFR2 playing a critical role in
complement-dependent tissue injury.

603844	TITLE *603844 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1, SUBUNIT C1; NDUFC1
DESCRIPTION The multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first
enzyme complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. See
NDUFA2 (602137). Ton et al. (1997) isolated human heart cDNAs encoding
CI-KFYI (NDUFC1) and 4 other complex I subunits. The predicted protein
contains 76 amino acids.

By radiation hybrid analysis, Mao et al. (1998) mapped the NDUFC1 gene
to 4q28.2-q31.1. By radiation hybrid analysis, Emahazion et al. (1998)
mapped the NDUFC1 gene to 4q28.2-q28.3.

Smeitink and van den Heuvel (1999) reviewed the available molecular data
regarding the human nuclear-encoded complex I subunits.

601873	TITLE *601873 BETA-1,4-N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE 1; B4GALNT1
;;BETA-1,4-N-ACETYLGALACTOSAMINYLTRANSFERASE; GALGT;;
GalNAcT;;
GM2/GD2 SYNTHASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The B4GALNT1 gene encodes beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase-1
(EC 2.4.1.92), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of complex
gangliosides (G), which are mono- (M), di- (D), and tri- (T) sialic
acid-containing glycosphingolipids generated by sequential
glycosylations. Gangliosides are part of the larger family of
glycosphingolipids and are components of the synaptic plasma membrane
involved in synaptic plasticity, signal transduction, and endocytosis
and then are critical for central nervous system development. B4GALNT1
catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine into GM3, GD3, and
globotriaosylceramide by a beta-1,4 linkage (summary by Boukhris et al.,
2013).

CLONING

Nagata et al. (1992) used expression cloning to isolate the cDNA for
beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAcT), or G(M2)/G(D2)
synthase. The cDNA encodes a 561-amino acid polypeptide. Northern blot
analysis revealed that the gene is expressed as 2 differently sized
transcripts in all cells tested that expressed G(MS), G(D2), or both.
These findings indicate that the cDNAs catalyze the transfer of GalNAc
into G(M3) and G(D3) by a beta-1,4 linkage, resulting in the synthesis
of G(M2) and G(D2), respectively.

GENE STRUCTURE

Furukawa et al. (1996) examined the genomic structure of the human
GalNAcT gene and found that it contains more than 11 exons spanning over
8 kb of genomic DNA. They reported that the gene has at least 3 distinct
transcription initiation sites that may be involved in cell
type-specific gene expression.

MAPPING

By FISH, Furukawa et al. (1996) mapped the GALGT gene to 12q13.3. Hamlin
et al. (1998) mapped the GALGT and KIF5A (602821) genes to 12q13 by
FISH. They found that these genes are contained within the same
approximately 200-kb YAC insert as the GLI (165220) and DDIT3 (126337)
genes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By exome sequencing of 5 families with autosomal recessive spastic
paraplegia-26 (SPG26; 609195), Boukhris et al. (2013) identified 5
different homozygous mutations in the B4GALNT1 gene. The mutations
segregated with the disorder in the families and were not found in large
control databases. Subsequent analysis of this gene identified
pathogenic mutations in 2 of 65 additional probands with a similar
disorder. All mutations were truncating, except for 2 missense mutations
that occurred at highly conserved residues (see, e.g.,
601873.0001-601873.0005). No functional studies were performed. The
phenotype was characterized by onset in the first 2 decades of life of
gait abnormalities due to lower limb spasticity and muscle weakness.
Some patients had upper limb involvement. Additional features included
intellectual disability, peripheral neuropathy, dysarthria, cerebellar
signs, extrapyramidal signs, and cortical atrophy. The disorder was
slowly progressive.

ANIMAL MODEL

Takamiya et al. (1996) found that mice with a disrupted B4galnt1 gene
lacked all complex gangliosides, but did did not show any major
histologic defects in their nervous systems or in gross behavior.
Electrophysiologic studies showed a slight reduction in the neural
conduction velocity from the tibial nerve to the somatosensory cortex,
but not to the lumbar spine. The findings suggested that complex
gangliosides are required in neuronal functions, such as synaptic
transmission, but not in the morphogenesis and organogenesis of the
brain. Higher levels of GM3 and GD3 expressed in the brains of these
mutant mice may have been able to compensate for the lack of complex
gangliosides.

Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC; 257220) is a progressive
neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene (607623)
and characterized by intracellular accumulation of cholesterol and
sphingolipids. To determine the relative contribution of ganglioside
accumulation in the neuropathogenesis of Niemann-Pick C disease, Liu et
al. (2000) bred NPC model mice with mice carrying a targeted mutation in
GalNAcT. Unlike the NPC model mice, the double mutant mice did not
exhibit central nervous system accumulation of gangliosides GM2 or of
glycolipids GA1 and GA2. Histologic analysis revealed that the
characteristic neuronal storage pathology of NPC disease was
substantially reduced in the double mutant mice. By contrast, visceral
pathology was similar in the NPC and double mutant mice. Most notably,
the clinical phenotype of the double mutant mice, in the absence of CNS
ganglioside accumulation and associated neuronal pathology, did not
improve. The authors concluded that complex ganglioside storage, while
responsible for much of the neuronal pathology, did not significantly
influence the clinical phenotype of the NPC model.

146740	TITLE *146740 Fc FRAGMENT OF IgG, LOW AFFINITY IIIa, RECEPTOR FOR; FCGR3A
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN G Fc RECEPTOR III-2;;
FCRIII-2;;
CD16A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Fc receptor with low affinity for IgG (FCGR3, or CD16) is encoded by
2 nearly identical genes, FCGR3A and FCGR3B (610665), resulting in
tissue-specific expression of alternative membrane-anchored isoforms.
FCGR3A encodes a transmembrane protein expressed on activated
monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and a subset of T
cells. In contrast, FCGR3B encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored protein that is expressed constitutively by neutrophils
and after gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570) stimulation by eosinophils
(summary by Gessner et al., 1995).

CLONING

By Western blot and flow cytometric analyses, Ravetch and Perussia
(1989) demonstrated differential expression of FCGR3 on
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and NK cells. The glycoprotein on
NK cells (FCGR3A) had a molecular mass 6 to 10 kD larger than that on
neutrophils (FCGR3B) and was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C. Transcripts derived from FCGR3A and FCGR3B in NK cells
and PMNs, respectively, have multiple single nucleotide differences,
including 1 that converts a termination codon to a codon encoding arg,
thereby extending the cytoplasmic domain by 21 amino acids and
introducing a transmembrane anchor for FCGR3A in NK cells. The deduced
FCGR3A protein contains 254 amino acids, whereas the deduced FCGR3B
protein contains 233 amino acids. Ravetch and Perussia (1989) concluded
that cell type-specific expression of 2 genes encoding alternative FCGR3
proteins has a significant effect on the biologic functions of the
molecules.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gessner et al. (1995) isolated and sequenced genomic clones of FCGR3A
and FCGR3B, located their transcription initiation sites, identified the
different organizations of their 5-prime regions, and demonstrated 4
distinct classes of FCGR3A transcripts compared with a single class of
FCGR3B transcripts. The gene promoters displayed different
tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting expression of
FCGR3A in NK cells and FCGR3B in neutrophils.

MAPPING

Le Coniat et al. (1990) mapped the FCGR3A gene to chromosome 1q23 by in
situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Anderson et al. (1990) concluded that CD16 is included in the zeta
natural killer cell receptor complex (CD3Z; 186780).

Some gamma-delta T cells (see TCRG, 186970 and TCRD, 186810) express
CD16. Using flow cytometric analysis, Bodman-Smith et al. (2000)
examined the relative proportions of CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in the
blood and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) patients
and the blood of control subjects. There was a significant reduction in
CD16+ gamma-delta T cells in synovial fluid compared with the
circulation. Mitogenic stimulation of circulating gamma-delta T cells
resulted in an increased expression of the HLA-DR activation marker and
a concomitant time-dependent decrease in the expression of CD16.
Bodman-Smith et al. (2000) concluded that CD16 expression is lost in the
synovial compartment as a result of activation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

On the natural killer (NK) cells of a 3-year-old boy who suffered from
recurrent viral respiratory tract infections since birth, de Vries et
al. (1996) found an unusual CD16 phenotype. The child also had severe
clinical problems with BCG vaccination and after Epstein-Barr virus and
varicella-zoster virus infections. His peripheral blood lymphocytes
contained a normal percentage and absolute number of CD3(-)CD7(+) cells,
which were positively stained with CD16 monoclonal antibodies. FCGR3
expression on granulocytes appeared to be normal. Sequence analysis of
the FCGR3A gene, encoding CD16 on NK cells and macrophages, showed a
T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230 on both alleles,
predicting a leucine to histidine amino acid change at position 48
(146740.0002).

By cloning and sequencing FCGR3A cDNA from NK cells and macrophages of a
heterozygous donor, de Haas et al. (1996) identified a 230T-G SNP that
resulted in a leu48-to-arg (L48R) substitution in the first
extracellular Ig-like domain and caused a higher electrophoretic
mobility of deglycosylated FCGR3A. PCR and restriction analysis
identified a 230T-A SNP, resulting in a leu48-to-his (L48H)
substitution, in another donor. Genotype analysis revealed a gene
frequency of 86% for 230T (L48), 6% for 230G (R48), and 8% for 230A
(H48) in 93 FCGR3B-positive individuals. In contrast, the frequency of
the 230G allele was significantly higher in 12 FCGR3B-deficient donors.
The H48 and R48 variants exhibited a higher binding capacity for IgG1,
IgG3, and IgG4 than did the common L48 variant. De Haas et al. (1996)
concluded that SNPs at position 230 of FCGR3A influence IgG binding, as
well as reactivity of CD16 monoclonal antibodies.

Koene et al. (1997) used PCR-based restriction analysis to genotype 87
donors for a 559T-G SNP in FCGR3A that results in a phe158-to-val
(F158V) substitution. They found gene frequencies of 57% and 43% for
F158 and V158, respectively. F158 was linked to L48, and V158 was linked
to R48 or H48. Through functional analysis, Koene et al. (1997)
determined that the previously identified differences in IgG binding
among the 3 FCGR3A variants at position 48 are a consequence of the
linked polymorphism at position 158.

Among 1,115 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) and 654
controls, Robinson et al. (2012) found no significant association
between FCGR3A copy number and disease.

Although nearly all adults have been exposed to herpes simplex virus
(HSV)-1, the clinical course of infection varies remarkably. By
analyzing the contribution of gene families on chromosomes 1, 6, 12, and
19 to susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in 302 individuals, Moraru et
al. (2012) identified no specific susceptibility locus. However, they
found that the risk of suffering clinical HSV-1 infection was modified
by MHC class I allotypes, HLA-C1 (142840) interaction with KIR2DL2
(604937), and the phe/val polymorphism at codon 158 of CD16A.

EVOLUTION

By determining the nature and rate of copy number variation (CNV)
mutation and investigating the global variation of disease-associated
variation at the FCGR locus, Machado et al. (2012) determined that CNV
of the FCGR3 genes is mediated by recurrent nonallelic homologous
recombination between the 2 segmental duplications that carry FCGR3A and
FCGR3B. They showed that pathogen richness, particularly helminth
pathogens, is likely to have influenced the patterns of variation in
FCGRs in humans. Machado et al. (2012) proposed that alterations to IgG
binding in the context of helminth infection have driven positive
selection in FCGR among different mammalian species, linking
evolutionary pressure of helminth infection with autoimmune disease via
adaptation at the genetic level. This model supports the 'hygiene
hypothesis,' which states that in the absence of chronic helminth
infection in modern populations, previously selected alleles respond to
immune system challenges differently and therefore may alter
susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) found that Fcrg (FCER1G; 147139) -/-
mice showed reduced mortality in an acute peritonitis model caused by
cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) compared with wildtype mice. The
reduced mortality in Fcrg -/- mice was associated with lower serum and
peritoneal Tnf (191160) and significantly increased capacity of
neutrophils and macrophages to phagocytose E. coli. Fcgr3 -/- mice also
had reduced sepsis after CLP. Fcgr3 bound E. coli, inducing Fcrg
phosphorylation, recruitment of tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 (PTPN6;
176883), and dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K;
see 171834). Decreased Pi3k activity inhibited E. coli phagocytosis and
increased Tnf production through Tlr4 (603030). Confocal microscopy
demonstrated negative regulation of Marco (604870) by Fcrg. Interaction
of E. coli with Fcgr3 induced recruitment of Shp1 to Marco and inhibited
E. coli phagocytosis. Pinheiro da Silva et al. (2007) concluded that
binding of E. coli to FCGR3 triggers an inhibitory FCRG pathway that
impairs MARCO-mediated bacterial clearance and activates TNF secretion.

FCGR3A, LEU48HIS

In a 3-year-old boy who had suffered from recurrent viral respiratory
tract infections since birth, de Vries et al. (1996) found an unusual
CD16 phenotype on the natural killer (NK) cells. Sequence analysis of
the IGFR3 gene showed a T-to-A nucleotide substitution at position 230
on both alleles, predicting a leucine-to-histidine amino acid change at
position 48 in the first extracellular Ig-like domain of the FCGR3A
protein. The child had also had severe problems with BCG vaccination and
with Epstein-Barr virus and varicella-zoster virus infections. The
clinical pattern was considered compatible with an in vivo dysfunction
of NK cells. Only 1 patient with absolute NK cell deficiency had been
previously described. Biron et al. (1989) reported the case of an
adolescent with recurrent life-threatening herpesvirus infections, who
completely lacked CD16 and/or CD56 positive cells in vivo and
NK-activity in vitro. In a note added in proof, de Vries et al. (1996)
called attention to the case of homozygosity for a IGFR3 mutation
reported by Jawahar et al. (1996).

612316	TITLE *612316 ATPase FAMILY, AAA DOMAIN-CONTAINING, MEMBER 3A; ATAD3A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATAD3A and ATAD3B (612317) are mitochondrial membrane proteins that
contribute to the stabilization of large mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA)-protein complexes called nucleoids (He et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using mass spectroscopy to identify cell surface antigens on myeloid
cell lines, followed by RT-PCR of promyelocytic cell line RNA, Geuijen
et al. (2005) cloned ATAD3A. Western blot analysis detected ATAD3A at an
apparent molecular mass of 75 kD in transfected human embryonic kidney
(HEK293T) cells. Flow cytometry revealed ATAD3A on the cell surface of a
promyelocytic cell line, on 77% of AML (601626) samples, on half of
monocytes, and on a subpopulation of dendritic cells, but not on other
lymphocytes. ATAD3A was not expressed on the surface of transfected
HEK293T cells.

By searching for sequences similar to rat Atad3, He et al. (2007)
identified human ATAD3A and ATAD3B. In its C-terminal half, the deduced
587-amino acid ATAD3A protein contains Walker A and B motifs, followed
by ATP-binding sensor-1 and sensor-2 motifs. An alpha helix is located
N-terminal to the Walker A motif, and an arginine finger separates the
sensor motifs. An antibody that did not differentiate between ATAD3A and
ATAD3B detected ATAD3 in a punctate pattern within mitochondria of human
osteosarcoma cells. The pattern frequently coincided with
mtDNA-containing nucleoids, but not all nucleoids contained ATAD3.

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) stated that ATAD3A contains a central
transmembrane domain. Using immunofluorescence and protease
susceptibility studies, they found that ATAD3A was embedded in the inner
membrane of HeLa cell mitochondria, with the C-terminal AAA domain
directed toward the matrix and the N terminus exposed to the cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (2007) found that depletion of ATAD3 via small interfering RNA
in human osteosarcoma cells led to increased negative supercoiling of
mtDNA, although mitochondria maintained essentially normal morphology.

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) found that, although both ATAD3A and ATAD3B
were present in native HeLa cell nucleoids, neither ATAD3 protein was
crosslinked with mtDNA in isolated formaldehyde crosslinked HeLa cell
nucleoids, indicating that they are unlikely to bind mtDNA. In addition,
protease susceptibility studies suggested that the putative N-terminal
DNA-binding regions of ATAD3A and ATAD3B reside outside the
mitochondrial inner membrane.

MAPPING

Bogenhagen et al. (2008) stated that the ATAD3 locus is tandemly
duplicated in humans, generating 2 paralogs, ATAD3A and ATAD3B. The
ATAD3 genes are located on chromosome 1p36.33 (Schaffrik et al., 2006).

164810	TITLE *164810 V-FOS FBJ MURINE OSTEOSARCOMA VIRAL ONCOGENE HOMOLOG; FOS
;;ONCOGENE FOS;;
FBJ OSTEOSARCOMA VIRUS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The human oncogene c-fos is homologous to the Finkel-Biskis-Jinkins
(FBJ) murine osteosarcoma virus oncogene. FOS was the first
transcription factor identified that has a critical function in
regulating the development of cells destined to form and maintain the
skeleton. FOS is also a major component of the activator protein-1
(AP-1) transcription factor complex, which includes members of the JUN
family (see also 165160).

CLONING

Van Straaten et al. (1983) determined that the human FOS gene encodes a
predicted 380-amino acid protein. Northern blot analysis revealed that
FOS is expressed as a 2.2-kb mRNA in placenta and fetal membranes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Van Straaten et al. (1983) reported that the human FOS gene contains 3
introns and spans approximately 4 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Muller et al. (1983) reported that the level of the c-fos gene
transcripts is 100-fold greater in human term fetal membranes than in
other normal human tissues and cells. These levels of c-fos expression
in human amniotic and chorionic cells are close to that of v-fos
expression that results in the induction of osteosarcomas in mice and
transformation of fibroblasts in vitro. The human c-fms gene (164770) is
expressed at high levels in term placenta and trophoblastic cells.
Muller et al. (1983) suggested that the physiologic role of the proteins
encoded by the FOS and FMS genes may be related to these embryo-derived
cells whose primary functions are protection and nourishment of the
human fetus. Using the technique of in situ hybridization, Dony and
Gruss (1987) demonstrated that stage-specific expression of the FOS gene
in mouse embryos is restricted to the perichondrial growth regions of
the cartilaginous skeleton. The possibility of a defect in FOS in a
skeletal dysplasia is raised by these findings.

Visvader et al. (1988) described 2 elements in the FOS promoter that can
mediate the induction of FOS by nerve growth factor (162030).

In studies of the Hayflick phenomenon (Hayflick, 1965), i.e., the finite
life span of cultured nonneoplastic cells, Seshadri and Campisi (1990)
demonstrated loss of FOS inducibility as the result of a specific,
transcriptional block. They interpreted the multiple changes in gene
expression as supporting the view that cellular senescence is a process
of terminal differentiation.

The FOS and JUN oncoproteins form dimeric complexes that stimulate
transcription of genes containing AP-1 regulatory elements. Bakin and
Curran (1999) found, by representational difference analysis, that
expression of DNA 5-methylcytosine transferase (DNMT1; 126375) in
FOS-transformed cells is 3 times the expression in normal fibroblasts
and that FOS-transformed cells contain about 20% more 5-methylcytosine
than normal fibroblasts. Transfection of the DNMT1 gene induced
morphologic transformation, whereas inhibition of DNMT1 expression or
activity resulted in reversion of FOS transformation. Inhibition of
histone deacetylase (601241), which associates with methylated DNA, also
caused reversion. These results suggest that FOS may transform cells
through alterations in DNA methylation and in histone deacetylation.

Grigoriadis et al. (1995) reviewed the role of FOS in bone development
and the relationship to SCF1 (120420) and SRC (190090) which have a role
in osteoclast development.

The POMC gene (176830) is occasionally expressed in nonpituitary tumors
leading to Cushing syndrome (219080). Bronchial carcinoid tumors, one of
the most frequent sources for ectopic ACTH secretion, often display
numerous features of the corticotroph phenotype. To identify new markers
of corticotroph differentiation in these tumors, Le Tallec et al. (2002)
compared the pattern of POMC expression in ACTH-secreting (ACTH+) and
nonsecreting (ACTH-) bronchial carcinoids by differential
display/RT-PCR. In ACTH+ tumors, beside the expected POMC gene, they
identified cFos and KIAA1775, a large expressed sequence tag encoding a
putative protocadherin-related protein. On the other hand, the
tetraspanin TM4SF5 gene (604657) was specifically expressed in ACTH-
tumors. The authors concluded that corticotroph differentiation of
bronchial carcinoid tumors is accompanied by induction and repression of
specific genes.

Hikasa et al. (2003) found p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) downregulation in
conjunction with c-fos upregulation in the lymphocytes of patients with
rheumatoid arthritis. Phosphorylation of STAT1 (600555) was also
decreased in rheumatoid arthritis lymphocytes. Hikasa et al. (2003)
determined that c-fos overexpression led to downregulated
phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT1, which in turn downregulated
p21 gene expression. They concluded that this regulatory pathway may
enhance the proliferation of lymphocytes in rheumatoid arthritis
patients.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Glover and Harrison (1995) stated that members of the FOS and JUN
families of eukaryotic transcription factors heterodimerize to form
DNA-binding complexes. Each protein contains a bZIP region consisting of
a basic DNA-binding domain and a leucine zipper domain. The authors
determined the crystal structure of a heterodimer of the bZIP domains of
FOS and JUN bound to DNA.

MAPPING

By study of mouse-human cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization,
Barker et al. (1984) assigned the FOS gene to 14q21-q31. Ekstrand and
Zech (1987) mapped the FOS gene to 14q24.3-q31. They pointed to the high
number of neoplasms that have been found to have aberrations in this
chromosome region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The long bones of transgenic mice overexpressing the FOS protooncogene
show lesions of fibrous dysplasia characterized by intense marrow
fibrosis and increased rates of bone turnover (Ruther et al., 1987). In
all 8 patients with fibrous dysplasia studied by Candeliere et al.
(1995), high levels of FOS expression were detected in the bone lesions.
No expression of FOS was detected in bone specimens from normal subjects
or from specimens of normal bone obtained from patients with fibrous
dysplasia. The cells that expressed FOS in the dysplastic lesions were
fibroblastic and populated the marrow space. A very low level of FOS
expression was detected in the biopsy specimens from the patients with
other bone diseases. One patient with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia had
the arg201-to-cys mutation (139320.0008) and 1 patient with the
McCune-Albright syndrome (174800) had the arg201-to-his mutation
(139320.0009) in the GNAS1 gene. The increased expression of the FOS
oncogene, presumably a consequence of increased adenylate cyclase
activity, may be important in the pathogenesis of the bone lesions in
patients with fibrous dysplasia.

Rogaev et al. (1993) excluded the FOS open reading frame as the site of
the type 3, or chromosome 14-linked, form of familial Alzheimer disease
(607822).

ANIMAL MODEL

Stable expression of c-fos in mice has been demonstrated in developing
bones and teeth, hematopoietic cells, germ cells, and the central
nervous system. The gene product is thought to have an important role in
signal transduction, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Wang et
al. (1991) demonstrated that overexpression of the gene in transgenic
and chimeric mice specifically affects bone, cartilage, and
hematopoietic cell development. Wang et al. (1992) studied the effects
of lack of c-fos by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. They
reported that mice heterozygous for lack of the gene appeared normal,
although females exhibited a distorted transmission frequency. All
homozygous fos -/- mice were growth-retarded, developed osteopetrosis
with deficiencies in bone remodeling and tooth eruption, and had altered
hematopoiesis. Johnson et al. (1992) found similar results. Homozygous
mutants showed reduced placental and fetal weights and significant loss
of viability at birth. However, approximately 40% of the homozygous
mutants survived and grew at normal rates until severe osteopetrosis,
characterized by foreshortening of the long bones, ossification of the
marrow space, and absence of tooth eruption, began to develop at
approximately 11 days. Among other abnormalities, these mice showed
delayed or absent gametogenesis, lymphopenia, and altered behavior.
Despite these defects, many lived as long as their wildtype or
heterozygous littermates (currently 7 months).

Grigoriadis et al. (1994) found that FOS mutant mice that develop
osteopetrosis have a block in the differentiation of bone-resorbing
osteoclasts that was intrinsic to hematopoietic cells. Bone marrow
transplantation rescued the osteopetrosis, and ectopic FOS expression
overcame the differentiation block. The lack of FOS also caused a
lineage shift between osteoclasts and macrophages that resulted in
increased numbers of bone marrow macrophages. These results indicated
that FOS is a key regulator of osteoclast-macrophage lineage
determination in vivo.

Using the multistep skin carcinogenesis model, Saez et al. (1995) tested
the ability of c-fos-deficient mice to develop cancer. Upon treatment
with a tumor promoter, c-fos knockout mice carrying a v-H-ras transgene
were able to develop benign tumors with similar kinetics and relative
incidence as wildtype animals. However, c-fos-deficient papillomas
quickly became very dry and hyperkeratotic, taking on an elongated,
horny appearance. While wildtype papillomas eventually progressed into
malignant tumors, c-fos-deficient tumors failed to undergo malignant
conversion. Experiments in which v-H-ras-expressing keratinocytes were
grafted onto nude mice suggested that c-fos-deficient cells have an
intrinsic defect that hinders tumorigenesis. The results of Saez et al.
(1995) suggested that a member of the AP-1 family of transcription
factors is required for the development of a malignant tumor.

Excitotoxicity is a process in which glutamate or other excitatory amino
acids induce neuronal cell death. Excitotoxicity may contribute to human
neuronal cell death caused by acute insults and chronic degeneration in
the central nervous system. Evidence suggests that FOS is essential in
regulating neuronal cell survival versus death. Although FOS is induced
by neuronal activity, whether and how FOS is involved in excitotoxicity
was unknown. To address this issue, Zhang et al. (2002) generated a
mouse in which FOS expression was largely eliminated in the hippocampus.
They found that these mutant mice had more severe kainic acid-induced
seizures, increased neuronal excitability, and neuronal cell death,
compared with control mice. Moreover, FOS regulates the expression of
the kainic acid receptor GLUR6 (138244) and brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF; 113505), both in vivo and in vitro. The results suggested
that FOS is a genetic regulator for cellular mechanisms mediating
neuronal excitability and survival.

Using a Drosophila model synapse, Sanyal et al. (2002) analyzed cellular
functions and regulation of the immediate-early transcription factor
AP-1, a heterodimer of the basic leucine zipper proteins FOS and JUN
(165160). They observed that AP-1 positively regulates synaptic strength
and synapse number, thus showing a greater range of influence than CREB
(123810). Observations from genetic epistasis and RNA quantification
experiments indicate that AP-1 acts upstream of CREB, regulates levels
of CREB mRNA, and functions at the top of the hierarchy of transcription
factors known to regulate long-term plasticity. A JUN-kinase signaling
module provided a CREB-independent route for neuronal AP-1 activation;
thus, CREB regulation of AP-1 expression may, in some neurons,
constitute a positive feedback loop rather than the primary step in AP-1
activation.

David et al. (2005) demonstrated that ribosomal protein S6 kinase-2
(RSK2; 300075)-null mice develop progressive osteopenia due to impaired
osteoblast function and normal osteoclast differentiation. They also
observed that c-fos-dependent osteosarcoma formation was impaired in the
absence of Rsk2; the lack of c-fos phosphorylation led to reduced c-fos
protein levels, which were thought to be responsible for the observed
decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of transformed
osteoblasts. David et al. (2005) concluded that Rsk2-dependent
stabilization of c-fos is essential for osteosarcoma formation in mice.

116951	TITLE *116951 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 11A; CDK11A
;;CELL DIVISION CYCLE 2-LIKE 2; CDC2L2;;
PITSLRE A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

While characterizing the structure of the CDC2L1 (CDK11B; 176873)
candidate tumor suppressor gene located on 1p36, Lahti et al. (1994)
identified a highly related gene within a contiguous 100-kb genomic
region. They referred to CDC2L1 as PITSLRE B, following the convention
of naming CDC2-related kinases by the amino acid sequence of the region
corresponding to the conserved CDC2 PSTAIRE box. The related gene was
designated PITSLRE A, or CDC2L2.

Xiang et al. (1994) isolated multiple, alternatively spliced CDC2L2
mRNAs. The CDC2L2 transcripts encode 5 protein isoforms ranging in size
from 65 to 110 kD. The isoforms vary in the length and sequence of their
N-terminal regions; the protein kinase catalytic and C-terminal domains
are identical. All contain a 30-residue acid blob domain comprised
primarily of glutamic acid. The mRNAs encoding the 3 largest isoforms,
CDC2L2 alpha-2-1, -2-2, and -2-3, contain 2 alternative translation
initiation sites separated by 58 amino acids. In vitro translation of
these mRNAs yields the 90- and 110-kD isoforms observed in extracts of
HeLa cells. Subcellular fractionation studies indicated that the 110-kD
isoforms are primarily localized in the nucleus. The 65-kD isoform was
detected only in cells undergoing apoptosis. Using Northern blot
analysis, Xiang et al. (1994) found that the alpha-2 isoforms are
encoded by 3.5- and 3.7-kb mRNAs that are expressed in most human cell
lines and tissues. The mRNA encoding the 65-kD CDC2L2 alpha-1 isoform
had a more restricted expression pattern. The authors also detected an
antisense transcript corresponding to the 5-prime untranslated region of
the alpha-1 mRNA. The antisense and sense transcripts shared the same
expression pattern.

The CDC2L1 and CDC2L2 genes encode almost identical protein kinases of
110 kD that contain at their C termini the open reading frame of a
smaller isoform of 58 kD. Cornelis et al. (2000) found that 2 PITSLRE
protein kinase isoforms, p110 and p58, are translated from a single
transcript by initiation at alternative in-frame AUG codons. p110 is
produced by classic cap-dependent translation, whereas p58 results from
internal initiation of translation controlled by an internal ribosome
entry site (IRES) with unique properties. The IRES element is localized
to the mRNA coding region, and its activity is cell cycle regulated,
permitting translation of p58 in G2/M.

Loyer et al. (2008) stated that both CDC2L2 and CDC2L1 can produce a
third isoform, p46, by caspase-dependent proteolysis of either the p110
or p58 isoforms. By immunofluorescence analysis of several human cell
lines, they detected p110 in both nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles.
Western blot analysis showed robust expression of p110 in several human
cell lines and in activated human peripheral blood cells. Only activated
blood cells expressed p58 and p46. Size exclusion chromatography of HeLa
cells revealed that p110 fractionated with protein complexes of about
170 kD to over 1 MDa.

GENE FUNCTION

Advanced-stage neuroblastoma (256700) and tumor-derived cell lines
consistently contain a deletion of 1 allele of the distal short arm of
chromosome 1. The deletion correlates with enhanced metastatic
potential, suggesting that inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene or
genes on 1p may contribute to the pathogenesis of these tumors. Lahti et
al. (1994) demonstrated that 1 allele of the entire CDC2L gene complex
was either deleted or translocated in 18 of 20 neuroblastoma cell lines
investigated. They suggested that the CDC2L gene complex may harbor 1 or
more tumor suppressor genes affected by chromosome 1p36 modifications in
neuroblastoma.

By immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays with human
cell lines, Loyer et al. (2008) found that p110 CDK11 associated with
the alpha and beta isoforms of cyclin L1 (CCNL1; 613384) and L2 (CCNL2;
613482) in a high molecular mass complex that showed splicing activity.
The p58 and p46 CDK11 isoforms interacted more weakly with the cyclin L
alpha isoforms. In vivo splicing assays showed that expression of cyclin
L1-alpha, L1-beta, L2-alpha, or L2-beta and/or p110 CDK11 increased
intron-splicing activity and altered alternative splice-site selection
in a cyclin L1 and L2 isoform- and cell type-specific manner. In
contrast with p110 CDK11, p58 and p46 CDK11 reduced splicing activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gururajan et al. (1998) determined the structure of the 140-kb CDC2L
genomic region. This region consists of 2 identical genomic segments
arranged in a tail-to-tail configuration. Each segment contains a CDC2L
gene linked to an MMP gene. See MMP21 (603320). In each case, the most
widely expressed products of the CDC2L gene are derived from a genomic
region that is composed of 20 exons and spans approximately 20 kb. The
authors reported that only 15 amino acids of the 773-786 residues that
encode the multiple CDC2L isoforms are unique to either CDC2L1 or
CDC2L2.

Feng et al. (2004) found that the promoter region of the CDK11A gene is
CG rich and does not contain TATA and CAAT boxes. They identified 2 ETS1
(164720)-binding sites, a cAMP-responsive element (see CREB1; 123810),
and a TCF11 (NFE2L1; 163260)-binding site. Feng et al. (2004) confirmed
binding of ETS1 and CREB1 to the CDK11A promoter region in vitro and in
vivo.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lahti et al. (1994) mapped the
CDC2L2 gene to 1p36.3.

HISTORY

Protein kinase p58 (CDC2L1; 176873) is a human cell division control
(CDC)-related molecule that is structurally and functionally related to
p34 (CDC2; 116940). Whereas the p58 gene is located on 1p36, Eipers et
al. (1991) found by mouse-human somatic cell hybrid studies that a
highly related p58 sequence maps to chromosome 15. Subsequently, the
CDC2L2 gene on chromosome 15 was retired by the HUGO Nomenclature
Committee. The designation CDC2L2 represents a gene on 1p36.

Although Lahti et al. (1994) reported that a third gene, PITSLRE C, was
also present in the region of 1p36 containing the PITSLRE A and PITSLRE
B genes, Gururajan et al. (1998) found that PITSLRE C does not exist.

146738	TITLE *146738 INSULIN-LIKE 3; INSL3
;;INSULIN-LIKE PEPTIDE, LEYDIG CELL-SPECIFIC;;
RELAXIN-LIKE FACTOR; RLF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Leydig insulin-like protein belongs to the insulin-like hormone
superfamily (Adham et al., 1993), which comprises insulin (176730),
relaxin (179730), and insulin-like growth factors I (IGF1; 147440) and
II (IGF2; 147470). The members of this family are characterized by a
signal peptide, a B-chain, a connecting C-peptide, and an A-chain.
Burkhardt et al. (1994) reported the isolation and sequencing of the
human Leydig insulin-like protein. The deduced amino acid sequence of
the pro-Leydig insulin-like protein has a primary structure more similar
to that of proinsulin than to pro-IGF1 and pro-IGF2. The protein,
designated INSL3, is expressed exclusively in prenatal and postnatal
Leydig cells.

GENE FUNCTION

To determine the functional region of the mouse Insl3 promoter and
factors controlling Insl3 gene expression, Zimmermann et al. (1998) used
2.1 kb of the 5-prime-flanking region of the mouse Insl3 gene to
generate chimeric constructs with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
(CAT) gene. Transient transfections of MA10 Leydig cells, LTK-
fibroblasts, and F9 embryonic cells by a series of 5-prime-deleted mouse
Insl3 promoter-CAT constructs revealed that the sequence between
nucleotides -157 and +4 directed the transcription of the reporter gene
in MA10 but not in LTK- and F9 cells, indicating that the determinants
of Leydig cell-specific expression reside within this region. DNase I
footprint analysis revealed that the sequences designated SF-1/1,
SF-1/2, and SF-1/3 within 3 DNase I-protected regions are homologous to
the consensus binding site of steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1; 184757). The
authors concluded that SF1 plays an essential role in transcriptional
activation of the Insl3 promoter.

Kumagai et al. (2002) noted that, like male mice lacking Insl3, male
mice lacking the Lgr8 gene (606655) show cryptorchidism. Using HEK293
cells transfected with human LGR8, they demonstrated increased cAMP
production following treatment with human, rat, or ovine INSL3.
Crosslinking experiments confirmed direct interaction between INSL3 and
LGR8. Cultured rat gubernacular cells expressed endogenous Lgr8, and
treatment with Insl3 led to a dose-dependent increase in cAMP production
and increased cell proliferation. Kumagai et al. (2002) concluded that
LGR8 is a cellular receptor for INSL3.

Wikstrom et al. (2006) studied changes in INSL3 levels during
spontaneous puberty in healthy boys, boys with aromatase
inhibitor-induced hypergonadotropic hyperandrogenism, and boys with
Leydig cell dysfunction (Klinefelter syndrome). Onset of puberty was
associated with a significant increase in INSL3 levels. Adult INSL3
levels (greater than 0.55 ng/ml) were attained at bone ages of 13 to 14
years. Boys with letrozole-induced hypergonadotropic hyperandrogenism
had, after 12 months of therapy, higher INSL3 levels than did
placebo-treated boys. In Klinefelter syndrome boys during spontaneous
puberty, after an initial increase similar to that in healthy boys, INSL
concentrations leveled off despite hyperstimulation by luteinizing
hormone (LH; see 152780). Positive correlations occurred between serum
INSL3 and LH and between INSL3 and testosterone levels in all 3 groups
(P less than 0.0001). The authors concluded that serum INSL3
concentrations may serve as novel markers for onset and normal
progression of puberty.

GENE STRUCTURE

Burkhardt et al. (1994) reported that the INSL3 gene comprises 2 exons
and 1 intron, and that the organization of the gene is similar to that
of insulin and relaxin. The transcription start site is localized 14 bp
upstream of the translation start site. The human genome contains a
single copy of the INSL3 gene.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Burkhardt et al. (1994) mapped the
INSL3 gene to 19p13.2-p12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tomboc et al. (2000) used SSCP analysis to screen the coding regions of
the 2-exon INSL3 gene in genomic DNA samples obtained from 145 formerly
cryptorchid patients and 36 adult male controls. Two mutations and
several polymorphisms were identified. Both mutations were located in
the connecting peptide region of the protein. The authors concluded that
the frequency of INSL3 gene mutations as a cause of cryptorchidism is
low, because only 2 of 145 (1.4%) formerly cryptorchid patients were
found to have mutations: arg63 to ter (R63X; 146738.0005), which was
likely to be pathogenetic because it was found in a boy with undescended
right testis and history of incarcerated right inguinal hernia, and
pro93 to leu (P93L; 146738.0002), which was found in an 8-month-old baby
with nonpalpable intraabdominal right testis.

Canto et al. (2003) studied genomic DNA from 150 patients with
idiopathic cryptorchidism. A heterozygous asn86-to-lys mutation (N86K;
146738.0001) in the INSL3 gene was found in 1 patient whose mother was a
heterozygous carrier of the mutation and whose father was homozygous
wildtype.

Ferlin et al. (2003) sequenced the INSL3 and LGR8 genes in a cohort of
87 patients with corrected cryptorchidism and 80 controls and found 3
mutations in the INSL3 gene in 4 patients (e.g., 146738.0002) and 1 LGR8
mutation (T222P; 606655.0001) in 4 patients (8 of 87, 9.2%). The authors
concluded that INSL3-LGR8 mutations are frequently associated with human
cryptorchidism and are maternally inherited.

ANIMAL MODEL

Nef and Parada (1999) showed that mice mutant for Insl3, which is
expressed in the developing testis, are viable, but exhibit bilateral
cryptorchidism due to developmental abnormalities of the gubernaculum,
resulting in abnormal spermatogenesis and infertility. Female
homozygotes have impaired fertility associated with deregulation of the
estrous cycle. The findings revealed roles for INSL3 in the development
of the urogenital tract and in female fertility. INSL3 may act as a
hormone to regulate the growth and differentiation of the gubernaculum,
thereby mediating intraabdominal testicular descent.

Zimmermann et al. (1999) also reported that mice deficient in Insl3
displayed bilateral cryptorchidism and gubernaculum feminization during
embryogenesis. The findings of Nef and Parada (1999) differed from those
of Zimmermann et al. (1999) in 2 respects: first, Nef and Parada (1999)
found that heterozygous mice had partial cryptorchidism, suggesting
dosage sensitivity of Insl3 for testicular descent. In contrast,
Zimmermann et al. (1999) did not observe delays in testicular descent in
heterozygous males. The heterozygous phenotype appeared to resemble most
cases of human cryptorchidism, where partial testicular descent at birth
often self-corrects. In the second place, Zimmermann et al. (1999) found
no effects on the estrous cycle.

Adham et al. (2002) investigated whether in vivo the Insl3-mediated
gubernaculum development is independent of androgens. They generated
transgenic male and female mice that overexpressed Insl3 in the pancreas
during fetal and postnatal life. Expression of the transgenic allele in
the Insl3-deficient mice rescued the cryptorchidism in male mutants,
indicating that the islet beta-cells efficiently processed the Insl3
gene product to the functional hormone. All transgenic females displayed
bilateral inguinal hernia. The processus vaginalis developed containing
intestinal loops. The mullerian derivatives gave rise to oviduct,
uterus, and upper vagina, and wolffian duct derivatives were missing,
indicating the absence of the androgen- and anti-mullerian
hormone-mediated activities in transgenic females. The ovaries descended
into a position over the bladder and attached to the abdominal wall via
the well developed cranial suspensory ligament and the gubernaculum.
Administration of dihydrotestosterone during prenatal development
suppressed formation of the cranial suspensory ligament and thereby
allowed the descent of the ovaries into the processus vaginalis. The
authors concluded that Insl3-mediated activity induces gubernaculum
development and precludes a role of androgen in this process.
Furthermore, they noted that the transgenic females exhibited reduced
fertility, which is due to fetal mortality during midgestation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CRYPTORCHIDISM
INSL3, ASN86LYS

In 1 of 150 patients with idiopathic cryptorchidism (219050), Canto et
al. (2003) found a heterozygous 2560C-G transversion in exon 2 of the
INSL3 gene, resulting in an asn86-to-lys (N86K) substitution in the
A-chain of the protein. The change was considered probably deleterious
because it led to a nonconservative amino acid substitution, changing a
highly conserved residue.

.0002
CRYPTORCHIDISM
INSL3, PRO69LEU

In a patient with unilateral cryptorchidism (219050), Tomboc et al.
(2000) identified a heterozygous 2511C-T transition in the INSL3 gene,
resulting in a pro69-to-leu (P69L) substitution.

In a patient with unilateral cryptorchidism, Ferlin et al. (2003)
detected the same mutation, which they reported as a heterozygous 278C-T
transition in the INSL3 gene that caused a pro93-to-leu (P93L) change
within an alpha-helix of the insulin-like-3 protein. The mutation was
inherited from the phenotypically normal mother.

.0003
CRYPTORCHIDISM
INSL3, ARG102CYS

In a patient with unilateral cryptorchidism (219050) originally reported
by Marin et al. (2001), Ferlin et al. (2003) found a heterozygous 304C-T
transition in the INSL3 gene that caused an arg102-to-cys (R102C) amino
acid change. The mutation was inherited from the mother, whose history
was negative for reproductive dysfunction and any other pathologic
condition.

.0004
CRYPTORCHIDISM
INSL3, ARG102HIS

In 2 patients with bilateral cryptorchidism (219050) with bilateral
severe testiculopathy, Ferlin et al. (2003) detected a heterozygous
305G-A transition in the INSL3 gene that caused an arg102-to-his (R102H)
change in the insulin-like-3 protein.

.0005
CRYPTORCHIDISM
INSL3, ARG49TER

In a patient with unilateral cryptorchidism (219050), Tomboc et al.
(2000) identified a 2450C-T transition in the INSL3 gene, resulting in
an arg49-to-ter (R49X) substitution.

607292	TITLE *607292 SEMAPHORIN 4A; SEMA4A
;;SEMAPHORIN B; SEMAB; SEMB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEMA4A is a member of the semaphorin family of soluble and transmembrane
proteins. Semaphorins are involved in guidance of axonal migration
during neuronal development and in immune responses.

CLONING

Using degenerate PCR primers based on motifs conserved in members of the
semaphorin family, Kumanogoh et al. (2002) identified mouse Sema4a,
which was originally identified as SemB (Puschel et al., 1995). RT-PCR
analysis detected prominent expression in adult mouse brain, spleen,
lung, kidney, and testis. Flow cytometric analysis showed expression in
B cells and dendritic cells (DCs) but not in resting T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kumanogoh et al. (2002) showed that activation upregulated expression of
mouse Sema4a in both B and T cells, and proliferation and interleukin-2
(IL2; 147680) production by T cells were enhanced in the presence of
Sema4a. However, Sema4a, unlike CD100 (SEMA4D; 601866), did not enhance
the activation of B cells or DCs. Mice treated with Sema4a had enhanced
priming of antigen-specific T cells secreting both IL4 (147780) and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570). Treatment of mice with anti-Sema4a
early after immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
suppressed the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
In these mice, infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells was
ablated by inhibition of the generation of antigen-specific T cells by
anti-Sema4a. Expression cloning determined that the high-affinity
receptor for Sema4a is Tim2. Sema4a stimulation of cells expressing Tim2
induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Tim2 but not of Tim3 (606652).
Kumanogoh et al. (2002) concluded that Sema4a and CD100 have crucial
roles in the reciprocal stimulation between T cell and
antigen-presenting cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Abid et al. (2006) screened 135 Pakistani patients with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP35; 610282), 25 with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD10; 610283),
and 30 with congenital blindness for mutations in the SEMA4A gene. They
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 substitutions
(607292.0001-607292.0002) in 2 RP and 2 CORD patients and heterozygosity
for another substitution (607292.0003) in 3 patients with RP and 1
patient with congenital blindness. No mutations in SEMA4A were found in
affected members of a Pakistani family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD8;
605549) previously mapped to chromosome 1q12-q24 (Ismail et al., 2006).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 35

SEMA4A, ASP345HIS

In 2 Pakistani patients with retinitis pigmentosa-35 (610282) and 2 with
cone-rod dystrophy-10 (610282), Abid et al. (2006) identified compound
heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion in codon 345 and a T-to-G
transversion in codon 350 in exon 10 of the SEMA4A gene, resulting in an
asp345-to-his (D345H) and a phe350-to-cys (F350C; 607292.0002)
substitution in the conserved semaphorin domain, respectively. Sequence
analysis of the unaffected parents of 1 of the CORD patients revealed
that his father was heterozygous for the D345H mutation and his mother
was heterozygous for the F350C mutation. Neither mutation was found in
100 ethnically matched controls.

In 3 Pakistani patients with retinitis pigmentosa-35 (610282) and 1 with
congenital blindness of uncertain phenotype, Abid et al. (2006)
identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition in codon 713 of exon
15 of the SEMA4A gene, resulting in an arg713-to-gln (R713Q)
substitution in the cytoplasmic tail. Sequence analysis of family
members of 1 of the RP patients confirmed that the R713Q mutation
segregated with the disease phenotype in an autosomal dominant mode of
inheritance, and the mutation was not found in 100 ethnically matched
controls.

605842	TITLE *605842 TRANSDUCIN-BETA-LIKE 2; TBL2
;;WBSCR13
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Meng et al. (1998) constructed a physical map encompassing the 1.5-Mb
region of chromosome 7q11.23 that is commonly deleted in Williams-Beuren
syndrome (WBS; 194050). They identified 3 genes within this region,
including TBL2, which they designated WS-beta-TRP. By EST database
searching, screening of a testis cDNA library, and sequencing, they
cloned a TBL2 cDNA encoding a deduced 426-amino acid protein with 4 WD
(or beta-transducin) repeats. TBL2 shares approximately 40% homology
with a hypothetical C. elegans protein, suggesting that the gene has
been conserved throughout evolution. Northern blot analysis detected a
2.4-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with high expression in
heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

Perez Jurado et al. (1999) cloned a TBL2 cDNA from a fetal brain cDNA
library and found that it encodes a deduced 447-amino acid protein with
a predicted molecular mass of 49.8 kD. They also cloned the mouse
ortholog, which shares 84% sequence identity with the human protein.
Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected not only the 2.4-kb
transcript, but an approximately 5-kb transcript which was ubiquitously
expressed at lower levels. Perez Jurado et al. (1999) also identified an
alternatively spliced transcript containing an additional exon (exon
2-prime) with an in-frame stop codon that encodes a deduced 75-amino
acid protein with 43 amino acids identical to TBL2 at the N terminus and
no known functional domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Perez Jurado et al. (1999) determined that the TBL2 gene spans 8.9 kb of
genomic DNA and contains 7 exons.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Pezzi et al. (2000) identified human and mouse EST fragments homologous
to the conserved nuclear stromalin proteins STAG1 (604358) and STAG2
(300826). Using these ESTs to screen testis cDNA libraries, they cloned
human and mouse STAG3 cDNAs encoding deduced proteins of 1,225 and 1,240
amino acids, respectively. Human STAG3 shares 75% sequence identity with
the mouse Stag3 protein and approximately 45% similarity with human
STAG1 and STAG2. STAG3 contains an acidic C-terminal domain, a 28-amino
acid domain conserved among mammalian stromalins, and an 86-amino acid
domain, designated SCD, conserved among all stromalin family members.
Northern blot analysis of human tissues revealed testis-specific
expression of a 4.5-kb STAG3 transcript. In mouse tissues, the highest
level of expression was found in male germ cells undergoing the first
meiotic division. Using immunofluorescence on developing male germline
cells, Pezzi et al. (2000) showed that STAG3 is associated with the
synaptonemal complex, exhibiting high expression in zygotene cells and
moderate expression in pachytene cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pezzi et al. (2000) determined that STAG3 contains 34 exons spanning
more than 30 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Pezzi et
al. (2000) mapped the human STAG3 gene to chromosome 7q22. By
interspecific backcross analysis, they mapped the mouse Stag3 gene to
chromosome 5 in a region of conserved synteny with human 7q22.

By genomic sequence analysis, Pezzi et al. (2000) identified 6 truncated
STAG3-like sequences that also mapped to chromosome 7. Pezzi et al.
(2000) noted that 2 of these sequences map to 7q11.23 and flank
breakpoints commonly associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome (194050).

;;RNA, U83A SMALL NUCLEOLAR; RNU83A;;
snoRNA, U83A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Intronic regions of ribosomal protein genes can harbor noncoding small
nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), like SNORD83A, which are generated during
pre-mRNA processing. snoRNAs form part of the small nucleolar
ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs) involved in pre-rRNA processing
and modification. snoRNAs of the box C/D class, like SNORD83A, function
in 2-prime-O-ribose methylation of rRNAs (Duga et al., 2000).

CLONING

Duga et al. (2000) identified several snoRNAs, including SNORD83A, which
they called U83A, within introns of the bovine and human RPL3 (604163)
genes. U83A originates from intron 5 of RPL3. The 95-nucleotide U83A has
a region complementary to 18S RNA and contains canonical motifs of box
C/D snoRNAs. Sequence analysis suggested that U83A forms a stem-loop
structure through basepairing of the 5-prime and 3-prime terminal
sequences. In this model, the loop contains boxes C and D on either side
of the stem, with the sequence complementary to 18S rRNA located
immediately upstream of box D. Northern blot analysis using a bovine
probe detected U83A expression in HeLa cells, mouse fibroblasts, and
bovine brain. RT-PCR detected U83A expression in a bovine kidney cell
line.

MAPPING

Duga et al. (2000) identified SNORD83A within intron 5 of the RPL3 gene
on chromosome 22q.

library, Yanaihara et al. (2001) cloned B29. B29 is located outside the
Ma29 deletion. The deduced B29 protein contains 248 amino acids.
Yanaihara et al. (2001) also identified 3 minor isoforms that differ in
the reading frame utilized and in the presence or absence of exon 3
and/or exon 6. Expression levels were below the limit of detection for
Northern blot analysis, but RT-PCR found near ubiquitous expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yanaihara et al. (2001) determined that the B29 gene contains 8 exons.

p85-BETA
PIK3R2/UPS8 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase that
phosphorylates the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol and related
compounds at the 3-prime position. The products of these reactions serve
as second messengers in growth signaling pathways. The kinase itself is
made up of a catalytic subunit of molecular mass 110 kD (PIK3CA; 171834)
and a regulatory subunit of either 85 kD, 55 kD, or 50 kD. Otsu et al.
(1991) showed that the bovine PI3K p85 subunit consists of 2 closely
related proteins, p85-alpha (171833) and p85-beta. They cloned cDNAs
encoding both p85 subunits, each of which is 724 amino acids long. The
subunits share 62% amino acid identity across their entire length. Both
sequences contain an N-terminal SH3 region, 2 SH2 regions, and a region
of homology to BCR (151410).

Janssen et al. (1998) determined the human p85-beta cDNA sequence.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional expression studies by Otsu et al. (1991) showed that both
bovine p85 subunits bound tyrosine kinase receptors.

Hale et al. (2006) generated a laryngeal carcinoma cell line
constitutively expressing influenza A virus NS1 protein and found that
NS1 bound specifically to p85-beta. The NS1 protein from various
influenza strains also bound p85-beta, but not p85-alpha. Expression of
NS1 led to induction of PI3K signaling, including phosphorylation of AKT
(164730) at ser473. Binding of p85-beta and activation of PI3K required
tyr89 of NS1, and mutant viruses expressing NS1 with a tyr89-to-phe
substitution grew more slowly in cell culture than wildtype viruses.
Hale et al. (2006) proposed that activation of PI3K signaling in
influenza A virus-infected cells is important for efficient virus
replication.

Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Park et al. (2010) showed that, in
addition to regulating PI3K function, p85-alpha and p85-beta regulated
the function of Xbp1s (XBP1; 194355), a transcription factor that
orchestrates the unfolded protein response (UPR) following endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress. Both p85-alpha and p85-beta bound Xbp1s and
increased its nuclear translocation, and it appeared that the p110 PI3K
catalytic subunit and Xbp1s competed for binding of these regulatory
subunits. p85-alpha and p85-beta formed an inactive dimer that was
disrupted by insulin in a time-dependent manner, which promoted their
association with Xbp1s. Refeeding of wildtype mice after fasting induced
ER stress that was quickly resolved, as measured by Xbp1s levels. In
contrast, obese and insulin-resistant ob/ob (LEP; 164160) mice could not
resolve the ER stress induced during refeeding, and nuclear
translocation of Xbp1s was absent in ob/ob mice. Overexpression of
p85-alpha or p85-beta in livers of ob/ob mice increased glucose
tolerance and reduced blood glucose concentrations.

To assess the impact of the AKT3 (611223), PIK3R2, and PIK3CA mutations
in individuals with megalencephaly-capillary malformation-polymicrogyria
syndrome (MCAP; 602501) and megalencephaly polymicrogyria-polydactyly
hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH; 603387) on PI3K activity, Riviere et al.
(2012) used immunostaining to compare PIP3 amounts in lymphoblastoid
cell lines derived from 4 mutation carriers with megalencephaly to those
in control and PTEN (601728)-mutant cells. Consistent with elevated PI3K
activity, and similar to what is seen with PTEN loss, all 3 lines with
PIK3R2 or PIK3CA mutations showed significantly more PIP3 staining than
control cells, as well as greater localization of active
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDPK1; 605213) to the cell
membrane. Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor PI-103 resulted in less PIP3
in the PIK3R2 G373R (603157.0001) and PIK3CA E453del (171834.0014)
mutant lines, confirming that these results are PI3K-dependent. Riviere
et al. (2012) found no evidence for increased PI3K activity in the
AKT3-mutant line, consistent with a mutation affecting a downstream
effector of PI3K. Protein blot analysis showed higher amounts of
phosphorylated S6 protein and 4E-BP1 in all mutant cell lines compared
to controls. Although PI-103 treatment reduced S6 phosphorylation in
control and mutant lines, the latter showed relative resistance to PI3K
inhibition, consistent with elevated signaling through the pathway.
Riviere et al. (2012) concluded that the megalencephaly-associated
mutations result in higher PI3K activity and PI3K-mTOR signaling.

MAPPING

Volinia et al. (1992) used in situ hybridization to map the PIK3R2 gene
to human chromosome 19q13.2-q13.4.

CYTOGENETICS

Janssen et al. (1998) analyzed DNA from a patient with chronic
myeloproliferative disorder. They identified an oncogenic fusion of the
5-prime end of p85-beta and the 3-prime end of HUMORF8 (USP8; 603158).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Riviere et al. (2012) performed exome sequencing in the oldest of 3
affected sibs with MPPH and identified a heterozygous mutation in the
PIK3R2 gene (G373R; 603157.0001). Sanger sequencing confirmed the
presence of the mutation in all 3 affected sibs and its absence in the
saliva and blood of both parents and the unaffected sister, showing
germline mosaicism in 1 parent. Sequencing of the PIK3R2 gene in 40
individuals with megalencephaly identified the same nucleotide change in
10 additional subjects with MPPH, and this mutation was shown to be de
novo in all subjects for whom parental DNA was available. The mutation
occurred at a CpG dinucleotide, which might explain its recurrence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Oak et al. (2006) crossed mice with a floxed Pik3r1 allele and a null
Pik3r2 allele with Lck (153390)-Cre transgenic mice to generate a strain
in which class IA Pi3k expression and function were essentially
abrogated in T cells beginning at the double-negative stage.
Histopathologic analysis of these mice showed development of
organ-specific autoimmunity resembling Sjogren syndrome (SS; 270150). By
3 to 8 months of age, mutant mice developed corneal opacity and eye
lesions due to irritation and constant scratching. Mutant mice showed
marked lymphocytic infiltration of lacrimal glands and serum antinuclear
and anti-Ssa (SSA1; 109092) antibodies, but no kidney pathology.
Cd4-positive T cells, which were the predominant infiltrating cells in
lacrimal glands of mutant mice, exhibited aberrant differentiation in
vitro. Oak et al. (2006) concluded that impaired class IA PI3K signaling
in T cells can lead to organ-specific autoimmunity, and they proposed
that class IA Pi3k-deficient mice manifest the cardinal features of
human primary SS.

In 13 individuals with

gly373-to-arg (G373R) substitution in the PIK3R2 gene. This mutation was
shown to be de novo in all subjects for whom parental DNA was available.
The mutation occurred at a CpG dinucleotide, which might explain its
recurrence.

614355	TITLE *614355 ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE SHORT CHAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 1; ACSS1
;;ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE 1; ACECS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fatty acids are incorporated into membranes and signaling molecules and
have roles in energy storage and metabolism. These essential functions
require activation of the fatty acid by acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
synthetases, such as ACSS1, which form an activating thioester linkage
between the fatty acid and CoA (Watkins et al., 2007).

CLONING

Fujino et al. (2001) cloned mouse Acss1 and Acss2 (605832), which they
called Acecs1 and Acecs2, respectively. The deduced 701-amino acid Acss1
protein shares 45.8% identity with Acss2. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression of a 3.6-kb Acss1 transcript in liver, kidney,
and testis. Lower expression was detected in heart, brain, spleen, lung,
and skeletal muscle. Fractionation of mouse kidney revealed cytosolic
localization for Acss1 and mitochondrial localization for Acss2.

By database analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) identified human ACSS1. The
deduced 689-amino acid protein contains 4 of 5 motifs characteristic of
acyl-CoA synthetases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ACSS1 belongs
to a short chain clade of acyl-CoA synthetases.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying proteins purified from transfected COS-7 cells, Fujino et
al. (2001) showed that both mouse Acss1 and Acss2 preferred acetate as
substrate for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA. Little to no activity was
detected with other short or medium chain fatty acids. Acss1 expression,
but not Acss2 expression, was induced by differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1
cells. In contrast, Acss2 expression, but not Acss1 expression, was
induced by fasting in mice and by diabetes in Zucker rats.

GENE STRUCTURE

Watkins et al. (2007) determined that the ACSS1 gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) mapped the ACSS1
gene to the minus strand of chromosome 20p11.23-p11.21.

MAPPING

Chen and Giblett (1976) and Pearce et al. (1976) presented evidence for
3 enolase loci. By in situ hybridization studies using a probe for ENO2
(131360), Craig et al. (1989) found small aggregates of grains at
1pter-p36, the site of ENO1 (172430), and some at 17pter-p12.

Feo et al. (1990) mapped the muscle-specific beta-enolase (ENO3) to
chromosome 17pter-p11 by analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids
and transfectant cell lines carrying different portions of chromosome
17. This muscle-specific enzyme maps to the region encoding the gene
cluster for the sarcomeric myosin heavy chains (MYH1; 160730).

GENE STRUCTURE

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene contains 12
exons and spans approximately 6 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a man with glycogen storage disease XIII (GSD13; 612932), Comi et al.
(2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ENO3
gene (G156D, 131370.0001; G374E, 131370.0002). Immunohistochemistry and

613583	TITLE *613583 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 62; WDR62
;;C19ORF14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The WDR62 gene encodes a protein that localizes to the centrosome and to
the nucleus, depending on the cell phase and on the cell type (summary
by Bhat et al., 2011).

CLONING

Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified the WDR62 gene in mutation analysis of
a patient with microcephaly and cortical abnormalities. The WDR62 gene
encodes a 1,523-amino acid protein. Immunohistochemical staining of
human fetal brain at 20 weeks' gestation demonstrated enriched WDR62
expression within the ventricular and subventricular zones. Stainings
suggested predominantly nuclear localization, which was confirmed by
immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis. WDR62 is
expressed by neural stem cells and intermediate progenitors, marked by
SOX2 (184429) and TBR2 (604615) expression. Expression of WDR62 in the
neocortex is transient, spanning the period of embryonic neurogenesis.
Unlike other microcephaly genes, WDR62 apparently does not associate
with centrosomes.

Nicholas et al. (2010) noted that WDR62 contains at least 15 WD repeats.
In HeLa, HEK293, and B lymphoblastoid cells, they found that WDR62 had
weak, diffuse cytoplasmic expression and was not found in the nucleus
during interphase. However, during mitosis, WDR62 accumulated strongly
at the spindle poles, although it was not present at the midbody in
cytokinesis. The expression pattern of WDR62 was identical to that of
ASPM (605481), which is mutant in primary microcephaly-5 (MCPH5;
608716). Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy of mouse embryonic
brain showed Wdr62 expression exclusively in apical precursors
undergoing mitosis at the apical-ventricular surface in the
neuroepithelium of the future cerebral cortex. Wdr62 expression was also
found exclusively in intermediate neural precursors found in the
subventricular zone during mitosis. Similar localization to mitotic
neural precursor cells was observed in human embryonic brain tissue.
WDR62 expression was also found in newborn neurons and in the outermost
layer of neurons that had just migrated to the cortical plate.

Yu et al. (2010) found widespread expression of Wdr62 in the developing
mouse brain, with highest expression in the forebrain. Expression was
seen in the ventricular zone and cortical plate, consistent with roles
in progenitor cells and postmitotic neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bilguvar et al. (2010) determined that the WDR62 gene contains 32 exons.

There are alternative WDR62 transcripts in humans: exon 27 contains an
in-frame intraexonic alternative splice acceptor site, resulting in the
exclusion of the first 12 nucleotides (Nicholas et al., 2010).

MAPPING

The WDR62 gene maps to chromosome 19q13.12 (Bilguvar et al., 2010).

GENE FUNCTION

Yu et al. (2010) found notable cell-cycle dependent cellular
localization of WDR62 in HeLa and HEK cells. During interphase, there
was punctate, perinuclear expression, suggesting localization to the
Golgi apparatus, whereas during M phase, WDR62 was found at the spindle
poles. The subcellular localization resembled that of CEP170 (613023).
The findings suggested a major centrosomal role for WDR62.

In cellular studies, Bhat et al. (2011) found that WDR62 localized to
centrosomes throughout mitotic progression. No staining was observed at
the midbody during cytokinesis. During interphase, WDR62 localized to
nucleoli. The findings indicated that WDR62 is a centrosomal as well as
a nuclear protein and that localization is dependent both on the cell
phase and on the cell type.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified 2 missense, 2 nonsense, and 2
frameshift mutations (613583.0001-613583.0005) in the WDR62 gene in 10
patients with microcephaly-2 with cortical malformations (MCPH2;
604317). All patients were from consanguineous Turkish families and
manifested with microcephaly, moderate to severe mental retardation, and
cortical malformation including pachygyria with cortical thickening,
microgyria, lissencephaly, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum,
schizencephaly, and in 1 instance, cerebellar hypoplasia.

In affected members of 2 consanguineous Pakistani families with primary
microcephaly showing linkage to chromosome 19q13 (MCPH2) (Roberts et
al., 1999), Nicholas et al. (2010) identified 2 different homozygous
mutations in the WDR62 gene (613583.0006 and 613583.0007, respectively).
In 5 additional consanguineous families of Pakistani, Arab, and
Caucasian ancestry with primary microcephaly, they identified 4
different homozygous WDR62 mutations (see, e.g.,
613583.0008-613583.0009, 613583.0011). Overall, the findings indicated
that WDR62 is a key protein in enabling spindle poles to position the
cytokinetic furrow and prolong neural precursor generation, a process
that is uniquely vital to the proper growth of the human cerebral
cortex.

Yu et al. (2010) identified 6 different homozygous mutations in the
WDR62 gene (see, e.g., 613583.0009-613583.0011) in affected members of 6
consanguineous families with microcephaly-2 with cortical malformations,
including polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, and subcortical heterotopia.

Bhat et al. (2011) identified 2 different homozygous truncating WDR62
mutations in 2 unrelated consanguineous Indian families with MCPH2 with
cortical malformations, bringing the total number of pathogenic
mutations in the gene to 17. Six of the 17 mutations are missense, and
mutations occur throughout the gene sequence. Bhat et al. (2011)
emphasized the wide phenotypic spectrum of cortical malformations in
mutation carriers.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 4-BP DEL, TGCC

In 2 sibs with autosomal recessive microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317) and in an affected child from another family, all
from consanguineous Turkish unions, Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for a 4-basepair deletion (TGCC) in exon 31 of the WDR62
gene. This deletion occurred at amino acid 1,402 and resulted in
frameshift and premature termination (V1402GfsX12). The mutation was
heterozygous in all parents. It was not observed in 1,290 Turkish
control chromosomes. The index patient was a 4-year, 6-month-old female
who initially presented at 4 months of age with small head size. At 2
years, 3 months she showed micrognathia and a bulbous nose, and suffered
from severe mental retardation. She had had no seizures. MRI showed
diffuse cortical thickening and pachygyria. The patient from the second
family was a 2-year, 4 month-old male. He had microcephaly and
developmental delay but no seizures. Coronal images of this patient
showed findings of microlissencephaly including prominent microcephaly,
bilateral Sylvian clefts, hypoplastic corpus callosum, and thickened
cortex. The kinship coefficients between affected individuals from both
families were consistent with fourth-degree relatedness.

.0002
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, GLU526LYS

In a 15-year, 5-month old female with microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317), the child of consanguineous Turkish parents,
Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A substitution
in exon 12 of the WDR62 gene, resulting in a glutamic acid-to-lysine
substitution at codon 526 (E526K). The glutamic acid at codon 526 was
invariant in all species examined from human to zebrafish and lamprey.
This mutation was found in heterozygosity in 3 apparently unrelated
neurologically normal Turkish individuals, giving an allele frequency of
0.2%. The patient presented to medical attention at age 3.5 years with
poor verbal skills. She had microcephaly, severe mental retardation,
prognathism, dysconjugate gaze, and dysarthria, and was able to ambulate
independently. Although abnormal electroencephalograms were noted, the
patient never suffered an overt seizure.

.0003
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, TRP224SER

In 2 sibs and their cousin with microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317), Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity
for a missense mutation in the WDR62 gene, a G-to-C transversion in exon
6 that converted tryptophan to serine at codon 224 (W224S). All parents
were heterozygous. The mutation was not identified in 1,290 Turkish and
1,500 Caucasian control chromosomes. Tryptophan-224 was invariant in all
species examined from human to zebrafish and lamprey. The proband was a
6-year, 5-month-old boy who presented at 2 years of age with
hyperactivity, seizures, and inability to sleep. He experienced 4 to 8
seizures per day and had microcephaly, micrognathia, and severe mental
retardation, and could ambulate only with assistance. The sibs were
cousins of the proband. One was an 8-year, 7-month-old female who
presented at age 3 with seizures. She was microcephalic, hyperactive,
and had dysconjugate gaze. She was able to walk independently and had no
obvious dysmorphic features but had moderate mental retardation. Her
brother was 12 years, 11 months old. He had seizures, self-mutilating
behavior, and severe mental retardation, but could ambulate
independently.

WDR62, GLN470TER

In a 14-year, 6-month-old male with microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317), the product of a consanguineous Turkish union,
Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition
in exon 11 of the WDR62 gene, resulting in a glutamine-to-termination
substitution at codon 470 (Q470X). This mutation was not identified in
1,290 Turkish and 1,500 Caucasian control chromosomes. The patient was
severely mentally retarded but had never had seizures. He had required
surgery for hernia repair and cryptorchidism.

.0005
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 17-BP DEL

In a 10-year, 10-month-old female with microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317), the product of a consanguineous Turkish union,
Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 17-bp deletion in
exon 30 of the WDR62 gene, leading to a frameshift at codon 1,280 with
premature termination following a novel peptide of 20 amino acids
(G1280AfsX21). She presented to medical attention at 3 months of age
with failure to thrive and small head size. On neurologic examination
she was noted to have good head control. She recognized her mother and
had a social smile. This mutation was not identified in 1,290 Turkish
and 1,500 Caucasian control chromosomes.

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with primary
microcephaly-2 (MCPH2; 604317), originally reported by Roberts et al.
(1999), Nicholas et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1313G-A
transition in exon 10 of the WDR62 gene, resulting in an arg438-to-his
(R438H) substitution in a highly conserved residue. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that the mutant protein did not localize
correctly to the spindle poles during mitosis. The mutation was not
found in 298 Pakistani control chromosomes. Brain scan from 1 patient
showed a simplified gyral pattern.

.0007
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
WDR62, 1-BP DUP, 4241T

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with MCPH2
(604317), originally reported by Roberts et al. (1999), Nicholas et al.
(2010) identified a homozygous 1-bp duplication (4241dupT) in exon 31 of
the WDR62 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutation was predicted to result in a stable transcript with C-terminal
deletion of 109 amino acids in a region that contains neither predicted
protein domains nor posttranslational modification sites. The mutation
was not found in 298 Pakistani control chromosomes. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that the mutant protein did not localize
correctly to the spindle poles during mitosis. Brain scans of patients
were not available.

MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
WDR62, ASP511ASN

In affected individuals from 2 unrelated Pakistani families with MCPH2
(604317), Nicholas et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1531G-A
transition in exon 11 of the WDR62 gene, resulting in an asp511-to-asn
(D511N) substitution in a highly conserved residue. The mutation was
found in 1 of 284 Pakistani control chromosomes. Brain scans of the
affected individuals were not available.

.0009
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 1-BP INS, 3936C

In a Turkish boy, born of consanguineous parents, with microcephaly-2
with cortical malformations (604317), Yu et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1-bp insertion (3936insC) in exon 30 of the WDR62 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The mutation was
not identified in 508 control individuals. He had severely delayed
psychomotor development, and brain MRI showed polymicrogyria, simplified
gyral pattern, volume loss, and a corpus callosum with incomplete genu
and small splenium. A second pregnancy was terminated after the
ultrasound showed microcephaly and abnormal gyral pattern in the fetus.

In a Caucasian girl, born of consanguineous parents, with microcephaly,
thickened cerebral cortex, and severe developmental delay, Nicholas et
al. (2010) identified homozygosity for the 3936insC mutation, which they
termed 3936dupC. The mutation was not identified in 396 Caucasian
control chromosomes.

.0010
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 1-BP DEL, 363T

In 3 affected Mexican sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with
microcephaly-2 with cortical malformations (604317), Yu et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (363delT) in exon 4 of the WDR62
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The mutation
was not identified in 508 control individuals. There was some phenotypic
variability: 2 sibs had small heads with a simplified gyral pattern on
brain MRI, 1 of whom had also had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and
severe psychomotor retardation. The third sib did not have seizures but
had more severe microcephaly (-5.4 SD), normal early psychomotor
development with later delay, and more complex MRI changes, including a
simplified gyral pattern, thin corpus callosum, and subcortical band
heterotopia.

MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH OR WITHOUT CORTICAL
MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, VAL65MET

In 3 affected Saudi Arabian sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with
microcephaly-2 with cortical malformations (604317), Yu et al. (2010)
identified homozygosity for a 193G-A transition in exon 2 of the WDR62
gene, resulting in a val65-to-met (V65M) substitution in a highly
conserved residue. The mutation was not identified in 508 control
individuals. Two sibs were more severely affected, with severe
microcephaly (-9.2 to -9.8 SD), profound psychomotor delay with spastic
quadriparesis, and polymicrogyria and open lip schizencephaly on brain
MRI. The third patient had microcephaly (-5.3 SD), developmental delay,
and simplified gyral pattern on brain MRI. All had relative preservation
of the cerebellum and brainstem.

In 3 Arab sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with primary
microcephaly (MCPH2; 604317), Nicholas et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for the V65M mutation. The mutation was not identified in
184 Arab control chromosomes. Brain scans of these patients were not
available.

.0012
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 1-BP DEL, 2083A

In 2 brothers with MCPH2 with polymicrogyria (604317), who were born of
unrelated parents of northern European descent, Murdock et al. (2011)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 truncating mutations in the
WDR62 gene: a 1-bp deletion (2083delA) in exon 17 and a 2-bp deletion
(2472delAG; 613583.0013) in exon 23. Both mutations were predicted to
cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and loss of function. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. The mutations were
identified by exome sequencing. The phenotype of the sibs varied. The
first sib, whose pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes, had
a more severe phenotype, with extensive bilateral polymicrogyria,
abnormal corpus callosum, global developmental delay, intractable
seizures, and spastic quadriparesis. The second sib had extensive
polymicrogyria and gray matter heterotopia, but did not have seizures;
he had age-appropriate cognition and only mild unilateral hemiparesis.
Both patients had head circumferences less than the fifth percentile.

607430	TITLE *607430 DAZ-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; DAZAP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human testis cDNA library with the
coding region of DAZ (400003) as bait, Tsui et al. (2000) cloned cDNAs
encoding DAZAP1 and DAZAP2 (607431). DAZAP1 is an RNA-binding protein of
407 amino acids. It contains 2 RNP motifs in the N terminus and has a
proline-rich C terminus. The protein shares high sequence homology in
the RNP regions with hnRNP A/B proteins (see 600124), but differs from
these proteins in the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of 2 DAZAP1 transcripts of 2.75 and 2.4 kb that were most
abundant in the testis and to a lesser degree in the thymus. All other
tissues expressed low levels of the transcript. RT-PCR of RNA samples
from testicular biopsies of 4 infertile men detected expression of
DAZAP1 only in samples with normal spermatogenesis, suggesting that
DAZAP1 is expressed mainly in the germ cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST-fusion binding analysis, Tsui et al. (2000) determined that
both DAZAP1 and DAZAP2 interact with DAZ and DAZL (601486). Deletion
constructs indicated that DAZ and DAZL bind to DAZAP1/DAZAP2 mainly
through the DAZ repeat region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Tsui et al. (2000) mapped the DAZAP1 gene to chromosome
19p13.3.

603616	TITLE *603616 RAB GTPase-BINDING EFFECTOR PROTEIN 1; RABEP1
;;RABAPTIN 5; RABPT5
RABEP1/PDGFRB FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The small GTPase RAB5 (179512) is a rate-limiting component in membrane
docking or fusion in the early endocytic pathway. The GTP-bound form of
RAB5 is the active conformation. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Stenmark
et al. (1995) identified HeLa cell cDNAs encoding a protein that
interacted with the GTP-bound form of RAB5. The predicted 862-amino acid
protein was designated rabaptin-5, a name combining the Greek word
'apto,' meaning 'touch', with RAB5. Both the N- and C-terminal regions
of rabaptin-5 are predicted to be mainly alpha-helical and contain
heptad repeats characteristic of coiled-coil domains. Western blot
analysis of mammalian cell extracts indicated that the 115-kD protein is
ubiquitously expressed and is present in a major cytosolic and minor
endosome-bound pool.

GENE FUNCTION

Stenmark et al. (1995) demonstrated that rabaptin-5 binds directly to
RAB5 and preferentially to its GTP-bound form. RAB5 recruits rabaptin-5
to early endosomes in a GTP-dependent manner. Overexpression of
rabaptin-5 leads to morphologic alterations of the early endosome
compartment similar to those induced by overexpression of RAB5. The
authors concluded that rabaptin-5 is an effector of RAB5 that transmits
the signal of the active GTP-bound RAB5 conformation to the membrane
docking and/or fusion apparatus. They proposed a model in which RAB5-GDP
is converted by a membrane-bound GDP/GTP exchange factor into the active
GTP-bound conformation. Once activated, GTP-bound RAB5 then recruits
rabaptin-5 from the cytosol, thereby positioning rabaptin-5 to exert its
function in membrane docking or fusion.

Xiao et al. (1997) reported that tuberin (191092) exhibits substantial
GTPase-activating protein activity towards RAB5, and that rabaptin-5
mediates the tuberin association with RAB5.

Using immunodepletion experiments, Horiuchi et al. (1997) found that the
RABGEF1 (609700)-RABPT5 complex was essential for both homotypic and
heterotypic endosome fusions. Both RABGEF1 and RABPT5 bound RAB5
preferentially in the presence of GTP rather than GDP. RABGEF1 displayed
specific GDP/GTP exchange activity on RAB5 upon delivery of RAB5 to the
membrane.

Mattera et al. (2003) found that the GGAs (e.g., GGA1; 606004), a family
of ARF (see 103180)-dependent clathrin adaptors involved in selection of
trans-Golgi network cargo, interacted with the RABGEF1-RABPT5 complex in
vitro and in vivo.

Omori et al. (2008) identified elipsa, the zebrafish ortholog of
TRAF3IP1 (607380), as a component of intraflagellar transport particles,
which are involved in the formation and function of cilia. Elipsa
interacted with rabaptin-5, which in turn interacted with Rab8 (RAB8A;
165040), a small GTPase localized to cilia. Omori et al. (2008)
concluded that elipsa, rabaptin-5, and Rab8 provide a bridge between the
intraflagellar transport particle and protein complexes that assemble at
the ciliary membrane.

Endocytosis plays a major role in the deactivation of receptors
localized to the plasma membrane. Wang et al. (2009) found that hypoxia,
via the VHL (608537)-HIF2A (EPAS1; 603349) signaling pathway,
downregulated rabaptin-5 expression, leading to decelerated endocytosis
and prolonged activation of ligand-bound EGFR (131550). Primary kidney
and breast tumors with strong hypoxic signatures showed significantly
lower expression of rabaptin-5 RNA and protein. Wang et al. (2009)
identified a conserved hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) in the
rabaptin-5 promoter that bound in vitro-translated HIF1A (603348) and
HIF2A, leading to displacement of RNA polymerase II and attenuating
rabaptin-5 transcription.

MAPPING

The RABEP1 gene maps to chromosome 17p13 (Magnusson et al., 2001).

CYTOGENETICS

In a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; see 607785) and
an acquired t(5;17)(q33;p13), Magnusson et al. (2001) demonstrated
rabaptin-5 as a novel partner fused in-frame to the 5-prime portion of
the PDGFBR gene (173410). The fusion protein included more than 85% of
the native rabaptin-5 fused to the transmembrane and intracellular
tyrosine kinase domains of PDGFRB. Rabaptin-5 is an essential and
rate-limiting component of early endosomal fusion. The RABEP1/PDGFRB
fusion protein links 2 important pathways of growth regulation.

;;GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATASE, CATALYTIC, 1; G6PC1;;
G6PT, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9), the key enzyme in the homeostasis
regulation of blood glucose concentrations, catalyzes the terminal step
in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (summary by Lei et al., 1993).

CLONING

Lei et al. (1993) cloned human G6PC from a liver cDNA library. G6PC
encodes a predicted 357-amino acid protein with an endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) retention signal and 6 putative membrane-spanning segments. The
expressed protein is indistinguishable from human microsomal G6Pase. Lei
et al. (1993) stated that the gene had previously eluded molecular
characterization primarily because of its tight association with the ER
and nuclear membranes.

Shelly et al. (1993) isolated cDNAs encoding G6Pase by taking advantage
of an albino deletion mutant mouse that is known to express markedly
reduced levels of G6Pase activity. The primary defect of this mutant
mouse is a loss of the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase gene (FAH; 613871)
located near the albino locus on chromosome 7. Fumarylacetoacetate
hydrolase (or fumarylacetoacetase) is the final enzyme in the tyrosine
degradation pathway, and a deficiency of this enzyme leads to the
accumulation of toxic tyrosine metabolites, resulting in reduced
expression of a group of liver-specific proteins, including G6Pase.
Newborn homozygous deletion mice develop hypoglycemia shortly after
birth, correlating with undetectable levels of G6Pase activity. Shelly
et al. (1993) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding murine liver
microsomal G6Pase by screening a normal mouse liver cDNA library
differentially with probes representing mRNA populations from the normal
and the albino deletion mutant mouse. They showed that the murine G6Pase
transcription unit spans approximately 10 kb and consists of 5 exons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lei et al. (1993) determined that the G6PC gene contains 5 exons and
spans approximately 12.5 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Lei et al. (1994) mapped the G6PC
gene to chromosome 17.

In the course of constructing a transcription map of approximately 600
kb of genomic DNA surrounding the BRCA1 gene (113705), Brody et al.
(1995) identified the G6PC gene, thus regionalizing its assignment to
17q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients with glycogen storage disease Ia (GSD1a; 232200), Lei et
al. (1993) identified homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations,
respectively, in the G6PC gene (613742.0001-613742.0003).

Lei et al. (1995) used SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing to characterize
the G6PC gene of 70 unrelated patients with enzymatically confirmed
diagnosis of type Ia GSD and detected mutations in all except 17 alleles
(88%). They uncovered 16 mutations that were shown by expression to
abolish or greatly reduce G6Pase activity and that, therefore, were
responsible for the clinical disorder. R83C (613742.0002) and Q347X
(613742.0004) were the most prevalent mutations found in Caucasians;
130X (613742.0001) and R83C were most prevalent in Hispanics; R83H was
most prevalent in Chinese. The Q347X mutation was identified only in
Caucasians, and the 130X mutation was identified only in Hispanic
patients.

Kajihara et al. (1995) identified a splice mutation in exon 5 (727G-T)
of the G6PC cDNA from the liver of a Japanese patient with GSD type Ia
(613742.0005). Another 8 unrelated Japanese families with a total of 9
affected individuals were found to have the same mutation, thus
representing 91% of patients and carriers of GSD Ia in Japan.

Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996) sequenced both alleles of 24 French GSD
type Ia patients; 14 different mutations were found, allowing the
identification of complete genotypes for all the patients. These
included 9 new mutations. Five mutations, Q347X, R83C, D38V
(613742.0006), G188R (613742.0012), and 158Cdel, accounted for 75% of
the mutated alleles.

Parvari et al. (1997) reported the biochemical and clinical
characteristics as well as mutation analyses of 12 Israeli GSD Ia
patients of different families, who represent most of the GSD Ia
patients in Israel. All 9 Jewish patients, as well as a Muslim Arab
patient, were found to have the R83C mutation (613742.0002). Two Muslim
Arab patients had the val166-to-gly (V166G) mutation (613742.0014),
which had not been found in other populations.

Akanuma et al. (2000) identified G6PC mutations in all alleles from 51
unrelated Japanese patients with GSD Ia. A total of 7 mutations were
identified, including 3 novel mutations. The most prevalent mutation,
727G-T, accounting for 88 of 102 mutant alleles, creates an aberrant
3-prime splice site within exon 5. The authors demonstrated that
ectopically transcribed G6Pase mRNA can be detected in lymphoblastoid
cells and may be used for the characterization of mutations that affect
mRNA splicing. They concluded that noninvasive molecular diagnosis may
ultimately replace the conventional method of enzymatic diagnosis that
requires liver biopsy in Japanese patients.

Stroppiano et al. (1999) analyzed the G6Pase gene in 53 unrelated
Italian patients and identified 88 mutant alleles (82.6%) with 18
(17.4%) remaining unidentified. The most prevalent mutation was R83C
(46.2%), followed by Q347X (20.7%); 3 other mutations (R295C, D38V, and
G270V) accounted for 5.6% of disease alleles. The authors suggested that
noninvasive screening could be used in Italian patients clinically
suspected of having GSD Ia, particularly in those from Sicily, where the
R83C mutation was present in 80% of mutant alleles. In all of 13
unrelated Korean patients with GSD Ia, Ki et al. (2004) identified
mutant alleles of the G6PC gene. Three known mutations and 2 novel
mutations were identified. The most frequent mutant allele was 727G-T,
present in 21 of 26 alleles (81%), which was slightly lower than that in
Japanese, where it was present in 86 alleles (92%), but much higher than
that in Taiwan Chinese (present in 44.4% of alleles).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, 2-BP INS, 459AT

In a patient with type Ia glycogen storage disease (232200), Lei et al.
(1993) found a 2-bp insertion at nucleotide 459 (ATins459) in exon 3 of
the G6PC gene. The insertion caused a frameshift with generation of a
stop codon at nucleotides 467-469. The predicted gene product was a
severely truncated protein of 129 amino acids. The patient was
homozygous for the TA insertion and the mother, the only parent
available, was heterozygous. Lei et al. (1995) referred to this mutation
as 130X referring to the number of the stop codon that was generated by
the frameshift. The 130X mutation had been identified only in Hispanic
patients.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, ARG83CYS

Lei et al. (1993) concluded that a patient with type Ia glycogen storage
disease (232200) was a compound heterozygote for 2 different G6PC
mutations: arg83-to-cys (R83C) and arg295-to-cys (R295C; 613742.0003),
located in exons 2 and 5, respectively. The exon 5 mutation came from
the father and the exon 2 mutation from the mother. Both mutations were
thought to involve a CpG doublet. Lei et al. (1994) demonstrated that
the R83C mutant has no detectable phosphohydrolase activity.

In a patient originally reported by Burchell and Waddell (1990) as
having a novel form of type 1 glycogen storage disease due to a defect
in the 21-kD stabilizing protein SP, Lei et al. (1995) demonstrated that
in fact there was an R83C mutation in exon 2 of the G6PC gene. They
found the same mutation in both homozygous and heterozygous form in
patients with standard GSD type Ia.

Qu et al. (1996) performed prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus
sampling in an Ashkenazi Jewish family in which a previous child was
homoallelic and both parents were heterozygous for the R83C mutation.
Molecular analysis showed that the fetus was not affected.

Parvari et al. (1997) found that the R83C mutation was present in all
Ashkenazi Jewish patients studied in Israel, suggesting that DNA-based
diagnosis may be used as an initial diagnostic step in this population,
thus avoiding liver biopsy.

Ekstein et al. (2004) tested 20,719 Ashkenazi Jewish subjects for the
R83C mutation and identified 290 carriers, giving a carrier frequency of
0.014. The authors noted that this carrier frequency translates into a
predicted disease prevalence of 1 in 20,000, 5 times higher than that
for the general Caucasian population, confirming a founder effect and
elevated frequency of type Ia glycogen storage disease in the Ashkenazi
population. They also tested 4,290 Ashkenazi subjects for the Q347X
(613742.0004) mutation and found no carriers. Of 30 Ashkenazi Jewish
patients with type Ia glycogen storage disease, all were homozygous for
the R83C mutation. Ekstein et al. (2004) concluded that R83C is the only
prevalent mutation for this disease in the Ashkenazi population.

See 613742.0002 and Lei et al. (1993).

.0004
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, GLN347TER

In a patient with type Ia glycogen storage disease (232200), Lei et al.
(1994) demonstrated compound heterozygosity for an arg83-to-cys mutation
(613742.0002) in exon 2 and a gln347-to-ter mutation in exon 5. The
latter mutation was detected in homozygous form in 2 sibs of an
unrelated family. The predicted Q347X mutant G6Pase is a truncated
protein of 346 amino acids, 11 amino acids shorter than the wildtype
G6Pase. Site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assays
demonstrated that the mutant protein is devoid of G6Pase activity.

.0005
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, IVS4AS, G-T, +86

In a 26-year-old man with GSD Ia (232200) and in 9 other Japanese
patients from 8 unrelated families, Kajihara et al. (1995) identified a
splicing mutation in the G6PC gene. The first patient was the progeny of
first-cousin parents and had a history of hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia
since childhood. The diagnosis of GSD Ia was based on the findings of
hypoglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia and liver biopsy
abnormalities. Residual G6Pase activity in the liver was 18% of normal
in both fresh and previously frozen liver biopsy specimens. A younger
brother was also affected. The cDNA prepared from the patient's liver
had a deletion of 91 nucleotides with no normal-sized cDNA. The mutation
resulted in a G6Pase polypeptide 146 amino acids shorter at the
carboxy-terminal portion than the normal gene product of 357 residues.
It was thought that the 18% of normal activity reflected nonspecific
phosphatase activity since the G6Pase activity was low or not detectable
in several unrelated GSD Ia patients homozygous for this mutation.
Analysis of mutant genomic DNA demonstrated a G-to-T transversion at
nucleotide 727 of their G6PC sequence. Although the patient's splice
site in intron 4 and exon 5 had a normal consensus sequence, normal
splicing did not occur. It is thought that the single base substitution,
located far from the splice junction, altered the splice site. Kajihara
et al. (1995) cited data indicating that 11% of aberrant splice
mutations represent the creation of new splice sites with no alteration
in the authentic splice site sequences. Nakai and Sakamoto (1994) found
that new 5-prime and 3-prime sites were created only in the upstream
region of the authentic 5-prime and 3-prime splice sites. However, this
characteristically Japanese GSD Ia mutation is an exception; a new
3-prime site occurred in the downstream region of a normal splice site.

Akanuma et al. (2000) found that the most prevalent mutation in a study
of 51 unrelated Japanese patients with GSD Ia was 727G-T, accounting for
88 of 102 mutant alleles.

.0006
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, ASP38VAL

In 4 unrelated French patients with GSD type Ia (232200),
Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996) found compound heterozygosity for a D38V
missense mutation in the G6PC gene. This resulted from an A-to-T
transversion of nucleotide 192 in exon 1. The mutation was predicted to
change an acidic amino acid (aspartic acid) to a nonpolar hydrophobic
amino acid (valine) in the middle of the first predicted transmembrane
spanning domain.

.0007
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, TRP77ARG

In a French patient with GSD type Ia (232200), Chevalier-Porst et al.
(1996) found compound heterozygosity for a W77R missense mutation in the
G6PC gene. The mutation changed a nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid
(tryptophan) to a basic one (arginine). The amino acid substitution
resulted from a T-to-C transition of nucleotide 308 in exon 1.

.0008
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, IVS1DS, A-G, +4

In a French patient with GSD Ia (232200), Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996)
found an A-to-G transition at position +4 of the 5-prime donor splice
site of intron 1 of the G6PC gene. The patient was a compound
heterozygote for this mutation and for the G188R mutation (613742.0012).

.0009
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, GLU110LYS

In a French patient with GSD Ia (232200), Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996)
found a E110K missense mutation in the G6PC gene. The mutation changed
an acidic amino acid (glutamic acid) to a basic amino acid (lysine). It
was due to a G-to-A transition of nucleotide 407 in exon 2. The mutation
was present in compound heterozygous state.

.0010
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, ALA124THR

In a French patient with GSD type Ia (232200), Chevalier-Porst et al.
(1996) identified a G-to-A transition of nucleotide 449 in exon 3 which
changed a nonpolar amino acid (alanine-124) to a polar one (threonine).
This mutation, inherited from the mother, was associated with the Q347X
mutation (613742.0004) in 2 sibs with GSD Ia.

.0011
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, GLY184GLU

In a French patient with type Ia glycogen storage disease (232200),
Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996) found a G-to-A transition of nucleotide
630 changing a nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid (glycine-184) to an
acidic one (glutamic acid). The G184E mutation is located in the
putative cytoplasmic domain of the enzyme. The mutation was present in
homozygous state in a family with no known consanguinity.

.0012
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, GLY188ARG

In 3 unrelated French patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia
(232200), Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996) found compound heterozygosity
for a G-to-C transversion of nucleotide 641, resulting in change of a
nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid (glycine-188) to a basic one (arginine).
This mutation, like G184E (613742.0011), is located in the putative
cytoplasmic domain of the enzyme.

Weston et al. (2000) identified a 5-month-old girl with hypoglycemia,
hepatomegaly, and lactic acidemia who was diagnosed with GSD Ia. She
also developed neutropenia, neutrophil dysfunction, and recurrent
infections characteristic of GSD Ib, but was found to be homozygous for
the G188R mutation of the G6PC gene. No mutations in the G6PC
translocase gene were identified. Weston et al. (2000) subsequently
identified a sib of this proband and 2 unrelated patients with similar
genotype-phenotype characteristics. They concluded that the unusual
association of neutrophil abnormalities in patients with homozygous
G188R mutations in the G6PC gene supports the modified
translocase/catalytic unit model.

.0013
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, ILE341ASP

In 2 sibs with type Ia GSD (232200), Lee et al. (1996) found compound
heterozygosity for an R83C substitution in exon 2 (613742.0002) and an
ile341-to-asp substitution in exon 5 of the G6PC gene. The nucleotide
substitutions were a G-to-A transition at base position 327 in exon 2
and a T-to-A transversion at base position 1101 in exon 5. The father
was heterozygous for the exon 2 mutation, while the mother was
heterozygous for the exon 5 mutation.

.0014
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, VAL166GLY

In 2 Muslim Arab patients in Israel with glycogen storage disease Ia
(232200), Parvari et al. (1997) identified a val166-to-gly (V166G)
missense mutation in the G6PC gene.

603721	TITLE *603721 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2L 3; UBE2L3
;;UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME UBCH7; UBCH7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s or UBCs) are essential components of
the posttranslational protein ubiquitination pathway, mediating the
transfer of activated ubiquitin to substrate proteins.

CLONING

The S. cerevisiae UBC1, UBC4, and UBC5 enzymes appear to participate in
the degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins. Human UBE2L1
(600012) is a homolog of yeast UBC4 and UBC5. By screening a genomic
library with a UBE2L1 probe, Moynihan et al. (1996) isolated clones
corresponding to a novel gene, UBE2L3.

Nuber et al. (1996) cloned human keratinocyte cDNAs encoding UBE2L3,
which they referred to as UBCH7. The predicted 154-amino acid protein
has 64% sequence similarity to UBCH5. UBCH7 efficiently mediated E6AP
(UBE3A; 601623)-dependent ubiquitination in an in vitro assay.

By RT-PCR, Moynihan et al. (1998) determined that UBE2L3 is expressed as
4 mRNAs that differ in the length of the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR). Sequence comparisons revealed that the human and mouse UBE2L3
cDNAs share 97% DNA sequence identity in the coding region and 93%
identity for 287 nucleotides extending into the 3-prime UTR. The
predicted mouse and human UBE2L3 proteins are identical.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moynihan et al. (1996) demonstrated that the UBE2L3 and UBE2L1 genes are
identical except that the UBE2L1 gene is intronless, while the UBE2L3
coding sequence is interrupted by 3 introns. Moynihan et al. (1998)
determined that the UBE2L3 gene spans approximately 57 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by FISH, Moynihan et al. (1996)
mapped the UBE2L3 gene to chromosome 22q11.2-q13.1. They also mapped a
pseudogene, UBE2L2, to 12q12. Ardley et al. (1997) found that another
pseudogene, UBE2L4, was located at 19q13.1-q13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Shimura et al. (2001) hypothesized that alpha-synuclein (163890) and
parkin (602544) interact functionally, namely, that parkin ubiquitinates
alpha-synuclein normally and that this process is altered in autosomal
recessive Parkinson disease (600116). Shimura et al. (2001) identified a
protein complex in normal human brain that includes parkin as the E3
ubiquitin ligase, UBCH7 as its associated E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme, and a novel 22-kD glycosylated form of alpha-synuclein
(alpha-Sp22) as its substrate. In contrast to normal parkin, mutant
parkin associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson disease failed to
bind alpha-Sp22. In an in vitro ubiquitination assay, alpha-Sp22 was
modified by normal, but not mutant, parkin into polyubiquitinated, high
molecular weight species. Accordingly, alpha-Sp22 accumulated in a
nonubiquitinated form in parkin-deficient Parkinson disease brains.
Shimura et al. (2001) concluded that alpha-Sp22 is a substrate for
parkin's ubiquitin ligase activity in normal human brain and that loss
of parkin function causes pathologic accumulation of alpha-Sp22. These
findings demonstrated a critical biochemical reaction between the 2
Parkinson disease-linked gene products and suggested that this reaction
underlies the accumulation of ubiquitinated alpha-synuclein in
conventional Parkinson disease.

Carrano et al. (2009) identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase Wwp1 (602307)
as a positive regulator of life span in C. elegans in response to
dietary restriction. Overexpression of Wwp1 in worms extended life span
by up to 20% under conditions of ad libitum feeding. Conversely,
reduction of Wwp1 completely suppressed the extended longevity of
diet-restricted animals. The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc18,
which is homologous to human UBE2L3, interacted with Wwp1 and was
required for Wwp1 ubiquitin ligase activity and the extended longevity
of worms overexpressing Wwp1. Carrano et al. (2009) concluded that Wwp1
and Ubc18 function to ubiquitinate substrates that regulate longevity
induced by diet restriction.

Wenzel et al. (2011) showed that, unlike many ubiquitin-conjugating
enzymes (E2s) that transfer ubiquitin with RINGs, UBCH7 lacks intrinsic
ubiquitin ligase (E3)-independent reactivity with lysine, explaining its
preference for HECTs. Despite lacking lysine reactivity, UBCH7 exhibits
activity with the RING-in-between-RING (RBR) family of E3s that includes
parkin (602544) and human homolog of ariadne (HHARI; 605624). Found in
all eukaryotes, RBRs regulate processes such as translation and immune
signaling. RBRs contain a canonical C3HC4-type RING, followed by 2
conserved cys/his-rich zinc-binding domains, in-between-RING (IBR) and
RING2 domains, which together define this E3 family. Wenzel et al.
(2011) showed that RBRs function like RING/HECT hybrids: they bind E2s
via a RING domain, but transfer ubiquitin through an obligate
thioester-linked ubiquitin, requiring a conserved cysteine residue in
RING2. Wenzel et al. (2011) concluded that their results defined the
functional cadre of E3s for UBCH7, an E2 involved in cell proliferation
and immune function, and indicated a novel mechanism for an entire class
of E3s.

610396	TITLE *610396 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A; TRAPPC6A
;;TRAPP COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRAPPC6A is a subunit of the TRAPPI and TRAPPII complexes (Gwynn et al.,
2006).

CLONING

Gwynn et al. (2006) cloned mouse Trappc6a, and they identified human
TRAPPC6A by database analysis. Mouse and human TRAPPC6A encode deduced
159-amino acid proteins that share 83% identity and have calculated
molecular masses of 17.4 kD. Both proteins contain 2 motifs conserved in
TRAPPC6B (610397) and several yeast TRAPP subunits, including Trs33, the
putative homolog of TRAPPC6A and TRAPPC6B. Northern blot analysis
detected Trappc6a expression in all mouse tissues examined, with highest
expression in kidney, liver, and testis. Expression of mouse Trappc6a
was higher in cultured melanocytes than in kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gwynn et al. (2006) determined that the mouse Trappc6a gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
TRAPPC6A gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH98840). Gwynn et al. (2006)
mapped the mouse Trappc6a gene to chromosome 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gwynn et al. (2006) identified a recessive mutation in mice, designated
'mosaic hypopigmentation' (Mhyp), that caused mosaic loss of coat
pigmentation and patchy loss of pigmentation with abnormal melanosomes
in the retinal pigmented epithelial layer of the eye. They determined
that Mhyp resulted from integration of an 8.4-kb retrovirus into intron
1 of the Trappc6a gene.

602644	TITLE *602644 TETRASPANIN 4; TSPAN4
;;TRANSMEMBRANE 4 SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 7; TM4SF7;;
TETRASPAN;;
NOVEL ANTIGEN 2; NAG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSPAN4 belongs to the large family of tetraspanins, so named because
they contain 4 transmembrane domains. Tetraspanins are frequently
expressed at the cell surface in association with each other and with
other molecules, such as integrins (see ITGB1; 135630), and they
function to regulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
differentiation (summary by Todd et al., 1998).

CLONING

Tachibana et al. (1997) generated monoclonal antibodies against proteins
that coimmunoprecipitated with CD81 (TAPA1; 186845) from a human breast
cancer cell line. Two antibodies recognized a 28- to 35-kD protein,
which Tachibana et al. (1997) named NAG2 for 'novel antigen-2.' Using
the antibodies to screen a cDNA expression library derived from the
breast cancer cell line, the authors cloned cDNAs encoding NAG2. The
predicted 238-amino acid NAG2 protein contains 4 hydrophobic domains and
shows homology to transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) proteins. Northern
blot analysis detected a 1.5-kb NAG2 mRNA, and together with flow
cytometry and immunohistochemistry, showed that NAG2 was expressed in
multiple tissues but was absent in brain, lymphoid cells, and platelets.
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that NAG2 colocalized with CD81 on
the cell surface. Tachibana et al. (1997) identified mouse ESTs encoding
the mouse homolog of NAG2. The human and mouse NAG2 proteins have 95%
amino acid identity.

By searching an EST database for sequences containing a tetraspanin
consensus sequence, Todd et al. (1998) identified human TSPAN4. The
deduced 238-amino acid protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and
other features characteristic of tetraspanins, including conservation of
charged residues in or near the transmembrane domains, similar to ion
channels, and of 4 cysteines in the second extracellular domain.
Northern blot analysis detected highest TSPAN4 expression in heart and
placenta. EST database analysis suggested that TSPAN4 is also expressed
in brain, melanocytes, pancreas, and fetal liver/spleen, in addition to
pregnant uterus and adult and fetal heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Tachibana et al. (1997) found that NAG2 coimmunoprecipitated with
integrins and other TM4SF members, indicating that NAG2 is present in
TM4SF-TM4SF and TM4SF-integrin complexes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TSPAN4 gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the TSPAN4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF022813) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611412	TITLE *611412 N-ACETYLNEURAMINATE PYRUVATE LYASE; NPL
;;CHROMOSOME 1 OPEN READING FRAME 13; C1ORF13;;
DIHYDRODIPICOLINATE SYNTHASE;;
C112
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase (EC 4.1.3.3) controls the cellular
concentration of sialic acid by catalyzing the conversion of sialic acid
into acylmannosamines and pyruvate (Wu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1 associated with
hereditary prostate cancer (HPC1; 601518), followed by screening cDNA
libraries, Sood et al. (2001) cloned NPL, which they called C112. The
deduced protein contains 320 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected weak expression of a 5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined.

By large-scale sequence analysis of clones obtained from a fetal brain
cDNA library, Wu et al. (2005) cloned a splice variant of NPL. The
deduced 301-amino acid splice variant, which they called NPLV2, contains
an N-terminal dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) domain and 5 putative
N-terminal phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected highest expression in
liver, kidney, and peripheral blood leukocytes, and lower expression in
placenta, pancreas, spleen, thymus, ovary, and small intestine. By
database analysis, Wu et al. (2005) identified 3 other NPL splice
variants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (2005) determined that the NPL gene contains 11 exons and
spans over 40 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sood et al. (2001) mapped the NPL gene to
chromosome 1q25.
