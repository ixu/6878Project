DESCRIPTION See KRTHA1 (601077) for general information on hair keratins.

Rogers et al. (1998) and Langbein et al. (1999) reported the
identification of the KRTHA6 gene, which they called HA6. Rogers et al.
(1998) found that the deduced KRTHA6 protein has 468 amino acids. They
stated that KRTHA6 is probably identical to the minor type I hair
keratin HAX (Heid et al., 1988). The KRTHA6 gene contains 7 exons. By
RT-PCR, Rogers et al. (1998) showed that KRTHA6 is expressed in the
human hair follicle. See Langbein et al. (1999) for further details on
the expression pattern of the KRTHA6 gene in the hair follicle.

Rogers et al. (1998) isolated and characterized 2 overlapping human PAC
clones that cover 190 kb on 17q12-q21 and contain 9 type I hair keratin
genes, 1 transcribed hair keratin pseudogene, and 1 orphan exon. The
order of the genes is 5-prime--KRTHA6--KRTHA5 (602764)--KRTHA2
(602760)--orphan exon--KRTHA8 (604542)--KRTHA7
(604541)--pseudogene--KRTHA1--KRTHA4 (602763)--KRTHA3B (602762)--KRTHA3A
(602761)--3-prime. The hair keratin genes range in size from 4.2 to 7.5
kb, and the genes are separated from each other by 5.5 to 18.4 kb; all
are located within about 140 kb. Each gene is transcribed from the
5-prime to 3-prime direction. Based on sequence homologies, the genes
can be grouped into 3 subclusters of tandemly arranged genes. One
subcluster, group A, consists of KRTHA1, KRTHA3A, KRTHA3B, and KRTHA4,
which share 89% overall amino acid identity. A second subcluster, group
B, contains KRTHA7 and KRTHA8, as well as the hair keratin pseudogene,
which the authors called HAA. The functional hair keratins and
hypothetical HAA hair keratin share approximately 81% overall amino acid
identity. The third subcluster, group C, consists of the structurally
less related hair keratins KRTHA2, KRTHA5, and KRTHA6, which share about
70% amino acid identity.

613534	TITLE *613534 FANCD2/FANCI-ASSOCIATED NUCLEASE 1; FAN1
;;MYOTUBULARIN-RELATED PROTEIN 15; MTMR15;;
KIAA1018
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FAN1 is a DNA endo- and exonuclease involved in the repair of DNA damage
caused by crosslinking agents. FAN1 is recruited to sites of interstrand
cross linkage damage by interacting with the FANCI (611360)-FANCD2
(227646) complex (MacKay et al., 2010; Kratz et al., 2010; Smogorzewska
et al., 2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned FAN1, which they designated
KIAA1018. The deduced protein contains 1,017 amino acids. RT-PCR
analysis detected relatively uniform FAN1 expression in all adult and
fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined.

Kratz et al. (2010) stated that the FAN1 protein contains a predicted
N-terminal RAD18 (605256)-like ubiquitin (191339)-binding zinc finger
domain and a C-terminal nuclease domain.

Zhou et al. (2012) found expression of the FAN1 gene in multiple
parenchymatous human tissues, including the kidney, liver, neuronal
tissue, and female reproductive organs. The expression pattern differed
from that of FANCD2, which was found primarily in lymphatic and bone
marrow-derived sources, as well as in skin and testes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using tandem affinity purification and large-scale immunoprecipitation
analysis, followed by mass spectroscopy, Cannavo et al. (2007)
identified FAN1 as a protein that interacted with the mismatch repair
proteins MLH1 (120436), PMS1 (600258), and PMS2 (600259).

Independently, MacKay et al. (2010) and Kratz et al. (2010) found that
recombinant human FAN1 exhibited DNA endonuclease activity toward
5-prime flaps and had 5-prime exonuclease activity mediated by its
C-terminal nuclease domain. Only DNA damage caused by interstrand
crosslinking agents resulted in recruitment of FAN1 to sites of DNA
damage, and this recruitment required interaction of FAN1 with
monoubiquitinated FANCD2. Depletion of FAN1 sensitized human cell lines
to interstrand crosslinking agents and caused chromosomal instability.
Smogorzewska et al. (2010) reported similar findings and showed that
FAN1 required both FANCI and FANCD2 for localization at sites of DNA
damage.

A central event in the Fanconi pathway is monoubiquitylation of the
FANCI-FANCD2 protein complex. Liu et al. (2010) characterized FAN1,
which promotes interstrand crosslink repair in a manner strictly
dependent on its ability to accumulate at or near sites of DNA damage
and that relies on monoubiquitylation of the FANCI-FANCD2 complex. Liu
et al. (2010) concluded that the monoubiquitylated complex recruits the
downstream repair protein FAN1 and facilitates repair of DNA interstrand
crosslinks.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the FAN1
gene to chromosome 15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 9 unrelated families with karyomegalic
interstitial nephritis (KMIN; 614817), Zhou et al. (2012) identified 12
different homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the FAN1 gene
(see, e.g., 613534.0001-613534.0008). Eight of the 12 mutations resulted
in a truncated protein. The first mutation was identified by
homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in 1 affected family. Upon
exposure to mitomycin C, FAN1 mutant cells showed genomic instability,
as manifest by increased chromatid breaks and radial chromosomes on
metaphase spreads. Although the results of the test for Fanconi anemia
(see, e.g., 227650), diepoxybutane-induced breakage, were negative in
FAN1-mutant cells lines, these cells still showed decreased survival in
response to either inducer of interstrand crosslink repair (ICL)
compared to controls. Thus, there were subtle differences in cell
reaction between FANCA (607139)-mutant and FAN1-mutant cells, suggesting
that these proteins act in somewhat distinct manners. None of the FAN1
mutant proteins was able to correct mitomycin C-induced decreased
survival in cells lacking FAN1 nuclease activity. Morpholino knockdown
of Fan1 in zebrafish embryos resulted in a nephronophthisis (NPHP;
256100)-like phenotype, with shortened and curved body axis, as well as
a Fanconi anemia-like phenotype, with microcephaly, microphthalmia, and
massive apoptosis. There was evidence of activation of the DNA damage
repair pathway, as demonstrated by increased signaling for gamma-H2AX
(H2AFX; 601772). Knockdown of born Fan1 and p53 (191170) in zebrafish
caused renal cysts, reminiscent of a ciliopathy. In the fawn-hooded
hypertensive rat, an animal model of chronic kidney disease, as well as
in kidney samples from humans with genetically heterogeneous forms of
chronic kidney disease, Zhou et al. (2012) found increased nuclear
staining for gamma-H2AX, indicating activation of the DNA damage
response pathway. These findings supported the hypothesis that DNA
lesions and DNA damage response pathways may partially drive renal
damage in NPHP-related ciliopathies and in chronic kidney disease.

In 2 brothers of Maori descent with karyomegalic interstitial nephritis
(KMIN; 614817) (Palmer et al., 2007), Zhou et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 2120G-A transition in exon 8 of the FAN1 gene, resulting in a
trp707-to-ter (W707X) substitution. The mutation was found by
homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing of the candidate region. The
mutation was not found in 96 controls.

In affected members of 2 French families with karyomegalic interstitial
nephritis (614817), Zhou et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FAN1 gene. Both families carried a
T-to-A transition in intron 2 (1234+2T-A), resulting in a splice site
mutation on 1 allele. One family (Godin et al., 1996) carried a 2-bp
deletion in exon 7 (2036_7delGA; 613534.0003) on the second allele, and
the other family carried a 2245C-T transition in exon 9, resulting in an
arg749-to-ter (R749X; 613534.0004) substitution on the second allele.
None of the mutations were found in 96 controls, and haplotype analysis
suggested a founder effect for the splice site mutation.

and a 2810G-A transition in exon 13, resulting in a gly937-to-asp

610606	TITLE *610606 CYTOPLASMIC POLYADENYLATION ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 3; CPEB3
;;KIAA0940
CPEB3 RIBOZYME, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned CPEB3, which they designated
KIAA0940. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression in brain, intermediate
expression in kidney, heart, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, testis,
ovary, pancreas, and fetal liver, and low expression in spleen and fetal
brain. CPEB3 was expressed in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest levels in amygdala and substantia nigra.

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) stated that CPEB3 transcripts use 2
alternate untranslated first exons, one expressed in liver and testis,
and the other expressed in brain. The 698-amino acid CPEB3 protein has
an N-terminal glutamine-rich domain, followed by 2 RNA recognition
motifs and a C-terminal zinc finger domain. The glutamine-rich domain is
not present in other CPEBs.

- CPEB3 Ribozyme

Using an in vitro self-selection technique, Salehi-Ashtiani et al.
(2006) identified self-cleaving ribozymes associated with olfactory
receptor OR4K15, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R; 147370),
a LINE-1 retrotransposon (see LRE1; 151626), and CPEB3. The CPEB3
ribozyme is located within intron 3 and is structurally related to
ribozymes from human hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a single-stranded RNA
satellite virus for hepatitis B infection (see 610424). EST database
analysis and RT-PCR of human and mouse total RNA extracts indicated that
the CPEB3 ribozyme is expressed and self-cleaves in vivo.
Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) identified the CPEB3 ribozyme only in
mammalian vertebrates. They proposed that HDV ribozymes and the CPEB3
ribozyme are evolutionarily related, and that HDV arose from the human
transcriptome.

GENE FUNCTION

- CPEB3 Ribozyme

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) narrowed the active sequence of the CPEB3
ribozyme to 81 nucleotides. This 81-nucleotide construct cleaved to
produce a 9-nucleotide upstream fragment containing a 2-prime-to-3-prime
cyclic phosphate, and a 72-nucleotide downstream fragment containing a
5-prime terminal hydroxyl that could be phosphorylated with
polynucleotide kinase (PNKP; 605610). The ribozyme had a low Mg(2+)
requirement, and was also active in the presence of Mn(2+) and Ca(2+).
Ribozyme activity was almost constant between pH 5.5 and 8.5, suggesting
the presence of 2 functional groups.

GENE STRUCTURE

Salehi-Ashtiani et al. (2006) reported that the CPEB3 gene spans 242 kb
and contains 11 exons, including 2 alternatively spliced, untranslated
first exons. Intron 3 spans 46 kb and contains a ribozyme.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the CPEB3 gene
to chromosome 10.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sidow et al. (1999) reported the positional cloning of the gene
disrupted in the mouse mutant dactylaplasia (Dac). The Dac gene belongs
to the F-box/WD40 gene family, which encodes adaptors that target
specific proteins for destruction by presenting them to the
ubiquitination machinery. In connection with biochemical studies, this
report demonstrated the importance of this gene family in vertebrate
embryonic development. Sidow et al. (1999) designated the Dac protein
product dactylin. Two different alleles of Dac were found to be due to
insertions, a common mechanism of mutation in the mouse (see ANIMAL
MODEL).

By positional cloning in the critical region for the split-hand/foot
malformation-3 locus (SHFM3; 246560) on chromosome 10q24, EST database
searching, and RT-PCR, Ianakiev et al. (1999) generated a cDNA encoding
human dactylin. Sequence analysis predicted that the 412-amino acid
putative cytoplasmic protein contains an N-terminal F box and 4
C-terminal WD40 domains. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous
expression of a 2.8-kb transcript that is strongest in fetal brain,
followed by kidney, lung, and liver. In situ hybridization of a
5.5-week-old mouse embryo confirmed the expression of dactylin in the
central nervous system and liver as well as at low levels in the
mesoderm and ectoderm of the developing limb. The data suggested to
Ianakiev et al. (1999) that dactylin is likely to be involved in
signaling pathways crucial for normal limb development and that it is a
candidate gene for SHFM3.

Ilyin et al. (2000) independently cloned human dactylin, which they
termed FBWD4.

By sequence and computational analyses, Salzman et al. (2012) identified
hundreds of transcripts that showed noncanonical ordering of exons in
pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples and normal human
leukocytes. The most abundant transcripts with scrambled exons
originated from the FBXW4, CAMSAP1 (613774), and ZKSCAN1 (601260) genes.
RT-PCR of human cells confirmed the findings. Transcripts with scrambled
exons appeared to be circular, as they showed lack of polyadenylation
and resistance to 5-prime exoribonuclease activity. Endogenous circular
and linear FBXW4 and CAMSAP1 transcripts were detected in both the
cytoplasm and nucleus of fractionated HeLa cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ianakiev et al. (1999) determined that the DAC gene contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ianakiev et al. (1999) identified the
human DAC gene in the critical region for the SHFM3 locus on chromosome
10q24. Using FISH, Ianakiev et al. (1999) mapped the DAC gene to
chromosome 10q24.3. They identified a pseudogene at the breakpoint
cluster region on chromosome 22q11.2 that shares greater than 93%
nucleotide identity with the DAC gene.

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the mouse Fbxw4 gene maps to chromosome
19C3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

De Mollerat et al. (2003) conducted mutation analysis of the dactylin
gene in 7 patients with split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM) and found no
point mutations. However, Southern blot, pulsed field gel
electrophoresis, and dosage analyses demonstrated a complex
rearrangement associated with a 0.5-Mb tandem duplication in all the
patients. The distal and proximal breakpoints were within 80- and 130-kb
regions, respectively; the smallest duplicated region common to all
patients was 444 kb and contained a disrupted extra copy of the dactylin
gene from exon 9 to exon 6, as well as the entire LBX1 (604255), BTRC
(603482), and POLL (606343) genes.

Because structural alterations of the gene encoding dactylin lead to
reduced levels of transcript in the mouse mutant Dac, which resembles
human SHFM, Basel et al. (2003) studied several individuals with SHFM
and reported a significant decrease of dactylin transcript. This
observation supported a central role for dactylin in the pathogenesis of
SHFM3.

Kano et al. (2005) screened 28 Japanese families with nonsyndromic SHFM
for tandem genomic duplication of chromosome 10q24 by Southern blot and
sequence analysis of the dactylin gene. No mutations were found in
coding regions and flanking intronic sequences of the dactylin gene, but
2 families had genomic rearrangements. One was a 511.6-kb tandem
duplication, and the other was a 447.3-kb duplication containing the
LBX1, BTRC, POLL, and DPCD genes and a disrupted extra copy of the
dactylin gene. Kano et al. (2005) noted that the smaller duplicated
region was almost identical to that described by de Mollerat et al.
(2003).

ANIMAL MODEL

Dactylaplasia, a mouse model of SHFM3, is an inherited limb malformation
that depends on 2 loci. The first locus, Dac, is an insertional mutation
around the dactylin gene that is inherited as a semidominant trait. Two
independent, spontaneous Dac alleles, Dac(1J) and Dac(2J), have been
identified. The second locus, Mdac, is a modifier on chromosome 13 that
is polymorphic in inbred strains. The dominant Mdac allele suppresses
the dactylaplasia phenotype in Dac mice, whereas the recessive Mdac
allele does not. Thus, dactylaplasia is observed only in mice homozygous
for the recessive Mdac allele. Kano et al. (2007) showed that the Dac
insertion is an LTR retrotransposon caused by the type D mouse
endogenous provirus element (MusD), which contains intact ORFs for the
viral gag, pro, and pol genes. In Dac(2J), MusD is inserted in intron 5
of the dactylin gene and no dactylin transcripts are expressed. In
Dac(1J), MusD is inserted in the upstream region of dactylin and neither
the size nor the amount of dactylin transcripts are affected. Kano et
al. (2007) refined the Mdac locus to a 9.4-Mb region on chromosome 13.
Dac mutants homozygous for the recessive Mdac allele had unmethylated
CpGs and active chromatin at the LTR of the MusD insertion, as well
ectopic expression of MusD elements. In contrast, Dac mutants carrying
the dominant Mdac allele had heavily methylated CpGs and inactive
chromatin at the LTR of the insertion, correlating with inhibition of
the dactylaplasia phenotype. Ectopic expression of MusD was not observed
in mice carrying the dominant Mdac allele. Kano et al. (2007) concluded
that ectopic expression of the MusD insertion, rather than lack of
dactylin expression, correlates with the dactylaplasia phenotype. They
proposed the Mdac acts a defensive factor to protect the host genome
from pathogenic MusD insertions.

614715	TITLE *614715 TRANSMEMBRANE AND IMMUNOGLOBULIN DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; TMIGD2
;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN AND PROLINE-RICH RECEPTOR 1; IGPR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TMIGD2 is widely expressed on the plasma membrane of endothelial and
epithelial cells and contributes to cell adhesion and migration (Rahimi
et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for genes encoding proteins with an
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, Rahimi et al. (2012) identified TMIGD2,
which they called IGPR1. The deduced 282-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 31 kD. It contains an N-terminal signal
sequence, followed by an extracellular Ig-like domain, a transmembrane
domain, and a cytoplasmic proline-rich C-terminal domain. The N-terminal
extracellular region contains 2 putative glycosylation sites. The Ig
domain was predicted to assume an Ig V (variable) fold structure.
Orthologs of IGPR1 were detected in several mammalian species, but not
in rat or mouse. Quantitative PCR revealed high IGPR1 expression in
artery, vein, and brain, with low to moderate expression in other
tissues. Western blot analysis detected an IGPR1 protein with an
apparent molecular mass of 55 kD in thymus, placenta, heart, small
intestine, skin, and kidney. An IGPR1 protein with an apparent molecular
mass of 35 kD was expressed in skeletal muscle, brain, colon, lung, and
ovary. Immunohistochemical analysis showed IGPR1 expression mainly in
epithelial and endothelial cells, and IGPR1 was expressed on the plasma
membrane of transfected porcine aorta endothelial cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Rahimi et al. (2012) found that overexpression of IGPR1 in porcine or
human endothelial cells increased tube formation in 3-dimensional
cultures. IGPR1 overexpression also increased angiogenesis in mouse
melanoma cells following injection into mice. In contrast, knockdown of
IGPR1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells reduced capillary tube
formation. IGPR1 overexpression also altered adhesion, migration, and
morphology of actin stress fibers in transfected cells. Protein
interaction assays revealed that the isolated proline-rich cytoplasmic
region of IGPR1 interacted with SH3 domains in several proteins, notably
SPIN90 (NCKIPSD; 606671). In porcine or human endothelial cells,
overexpression or knockdown of SPIN90 increased and decreased,
respectively, tube formation in 3-dimensional culture. Rahimi et al.
(2012) hypothesized that interaction between IGPR1 and SPIN90 regulates
angiogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rahimi et al. (2012) reported that the TMIGD2 gene contains at least 4
exons.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the TMIGD2 gene to chromosome 19p13.3 based on an
alignment of the TMIGD2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC015655) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602981	TITLE *602981 AE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; AEBP1
;;AORTIC CARBOXYPEPTIDASE-LIKE PROTEIN; ACLP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vascular smooth muscle cells originate from diverse cell types during
embryonic development and acquire different phenotypes in disease
states. The interactions of these cells with the extracellular matrix
(ECM) are important in governing these processes. By screening a human
aortic smooth muscle cell expression library for proteins that interact
with the E47 product of E2A (TCF3; 147141), Layne et al. (1998) isolated
a full-length cDNA encoding ACLP. The deduced 1,158-amino acid ACLP
protein contains a putative signal peptide; an 11-residue lys/pro-rich
motif repeated 4 times in the N terminus; a domain with 30% identity to
the slime mold adhesion protein discoidin I; and a C-terminal 500-amino
acid domain with 39% identity to carboxypeptidase E (CPE; 114855).
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.0-kb ACLP transcript. Immunoblot
analysis showed expression of a 175-kD ACLP protein. Western blot
analysis and in situ hybridization established that expression of ACLP
is largely restricted to aorta, particularly to smooth muscle cells.
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated perinuclear staining in mouse
aortic smooth muscle cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By purification of aortic smooth muscle cells from day-18.5 mouse
embryos, followed by immunoblot analysis, Layne et al. (2001) showed
that Aclp is a secreted protein that associates with the ECM, as
predicted from its primary structure. Immunohistochemistry of day-15.5
mouse embryos revealed wide expression of Aclp in vascular smooth muscle
cells, in bony and cartilaginous skeleton (skull, vertebrae, and ribs),
in the basement membrane of lung airways, and in the dermis.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Layne et al. (2001) determined that the
mouse Aclp gene contains 21 exons.

ANIMAL MODEL

By homologous recombination, Layne et al. (2001) generated Aclp -/-
mice. Although heterozygotes were phenotypically normal, most Aclp -/-
mice succumbed around the time of birth with gastroschisis, an extrusion
of the abdominal viscera through the ventral body wall. Gastoschisis
appeared as early as day 13.5. Many dead neonates were pale and had
missing abdominal organs, such as liver and intestine. Aclp -/- mice
that survived to adulthood had large, nonhealing skin lesions, deficient
wound repair, and poor fibroblast proliferation. Layne et al. (2001)
concluded that ACLP has important roles in both embryonic development
and adult tissue repair.

HISTORY

Layne et al. (1998) found that the C terminus of ACLP is highly
homologous to AEBP1, which was originally identified in mouse by He et
al. (1995) as a factor that specifically binds AE1 and acts as a
repressor of aP2 gene (600434) expression. Aebp1 contains a region that
is 40% identical to the regulatory carboxypeptidases CPH/E, CPN
(212070), and CPM (114860). He et al. (1995) found that CP activity was
important for the transcriptional repression activity of Aebp1 and
suggested that Aebp1 regulates transcription by cleavage of factors
involved in transcription. Ohno et al. (1996) identified human AEBP1 as
a gene whose cDNAs were found exclusively in osteoblast and adipose
tissue libraries. The predicted 845-amino acid human AEBP1 protein is
95% identical to mouse Aebp1 except for an additional 105 amino acids in
the N terminus of the human protein. This N-terminal extension contains
a nuclear targeting signal. Northern blot analysis of various human
tissues detected a 3-kb AEBP1 mRNA only in osteoblasts and adipose
tissues.

Song and Fricker (1997), however, reported that AEBP1 has no
carboxypeptidase activity; in contrast, CPZ (603105), CPE, and CPD
(603102) were found to have modest or abundant activity. Layne et al.
(1998) determined that the Aebp1 sequence described by He et al. (1995)
lacks a G residue 11 bases 5-prime of the proposed start codon and is
likely an incomplete clone of mouse Aclp. Northern blot analysis, even
with Aepb1-derived probes, detected a single 4.0-kb transcript, which is
consistent with the size of the human and mouse ACLP cDNAs. Furthermore,
Layne (2001) stated that they have never detected nuclear localization
of ACLP, nor have they detected any ACLP splice variants that might
account for the discrepant data, suggesting that the human sequence
reported by Ohno et al. (1996) is also a truncated clone.

606343	TITLE *606343 POLYMERASE, DNA, LAMBDA; POLL
DESCRIPTION DNA polymerases can participate in both replication of the genome and
DNA repair processes. The human genome contains multiple DNA polymerase
genes.

CLONING

By searching sequence databases to identify new members of the polX
family, Aoufouchi et al. (2000) identified EST clones representing 2 DNA
polymerases, POLM (606344) and POLL, which they called pol mu and pol
lambda, respectively. By screening bone marrow and lymph node cDNA
libraries, they isolated a full-length POLL cDNA. POLL encodes a deduced
575-amino acid protein predicted to contain a polX domain, a BRCA-1
C-terminal (BRCT) domain, and 2 helix-hairpin-helix (HHH) DNA-binding
motifs. POLL structurally resembles terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase
(TDT; 187410). It shares 34% amino acid identity with DNA polymerase
beta (POLB; 174760) and 82% identity with mouse Poll. Aoufouchi et al.
(2000) found that POLL has template-dependent DNA polymerase activity in
vitro. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.7-kb POLL transcript with
highest expression in testis and fetal liver and very weak expression in
many other tissues. They identified POLL splice variants which they
considered to be nonfunctional. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR
amplification, Aoufouchi et al. (2000) concluded that POLL mRNA
expression is downregulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner upon
cell exposure to DNA damaging agents.

Aoufouchi et al. (2000) provided a phylogenetic comparison of yeast and
human proteins of the polX family.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aoufouchi et al. (2000) determined that POLL is encoded by 8 exons and
spans approximately 9 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the POLL
gene to human chromosome 10 (TMAP sts-W69567).

;;ASPARTOACYLASE 3;;
HEPATITIS C VIRUS CORE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; HCBP1;;
HCV CORE-BINDING PROTEIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aminoacylase-3 is a hydrolase that removes the acyl group from several
acylated aromatic amino acids and from S-benzyl-N-acetylcysteine
(Pushkin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Pushkin et al. (2004) cloned mouse Acy3, which encodes a deduced
318-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of about 35.2
kD. Acy3 has no membrane domain, but it contains consensus sites for
N-glycosylation, tyrosine sulfation, tyrosine and threonine
phosphorylation, and myristoylation. Northern blot analysis detected
high expression of an approximately 1.4-kb Acy3 transcript in kidney,
followed by liver. Weaker expression was detected in heart, small
intestine, brain, lung, testis, and stomach. Testis expressed an
additional transcript of about 2.2 kb. Immunocytochemical analysis of
mouse kidney revealed Acy3 localization to the apical membrane of S1
convoluted proximal tubule cells and in the cytoplasm of S2 and S3
proximal straight tubule cells. Gel-filtration and transmission electron
microscopy showed that Acy3 formed tetramers.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying mouse Acy3 expressed in HEK293 cells, Pushkin et al. (2004)
found that it used all acetylated substrates examined, which included
N-acetyl-L-histidine, N-acetyl-L-tyrosine, N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine, and
S-benzyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteine. It showed highest affinity for
S-benzyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteine and had a pH optimum of 7.5 to 7.7.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ACY3 gene to chromosome 11q13.2 based on an
alignment of the ACY3 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF359506) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Pushkin et al. (2004) stated that mouse Acy3 maps to chromosome 19.

606696	TITLE *606696 KATANIN, p60 SUBUNIT, A1; KATNA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Microtubules are dynamic polymers of alpha-tubulin (e.g., TUBA3; 602529)
and beta-tubulin (TUBB; 191130) that are used to organize membranous
organelles during interphase and to segregate chromosomes during
mitosis. Microtubule-severing proteins generate internal breaks within
microtubules during metaphase but not during interphase. Katanin is an
ATP-dependent microtubule-severing protein composed of p60 and p80
subunits. Katanin p80 (KATNB1; 602703) is concentrated at centrosomes
during interphase.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of sea urchin p60 katanin,
followed by 3-prime RACE with fibroblast cDNA, McNally and Thomas (1998)
isolated a cDNA encoding KATNA1. Sequence analysis predicted that the
491-amino acid KATNA1 protein contains a central consensus cyclin B
(CCNB1; 123836)/CDC2 (116940) phosphorylation site (TPLK). The
N-terminal 80 residues of KATNA1 and sea urchin p60 katanin are 50%
identical, and the C-terminal 318-residue AAA (for 'ATPase associated
with a variety of cellular activities') ATPase domain of KATNA1 and sea
urchin p60 katanin are 75% identical. Immunoblot analysis revealed wide
expression of a 55- to 60-kD protein that was coexpressed with p80
katanin in frog eggs. Anti-KATNA1 antibody inhibited
microtubule-severing activity in Xenopus eggs. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated diffuse expression and focal colocalization with
gamma-tubulin (TUBG; 191135) in interphase fibroblast microtubule
asters, as is also seen with KATNB1. McNally and Thomas (1998) observed
that the area occupied by KATNA1 is twice that occupied by TUBG during
metaphase. McNally and Thomas (1998) proposed that CCNB1/CDC2 activates
KATNA1 microtubule-severing activity near centrosomes during mitosis.

Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis, Karabay et
al. (2004) showed that Katna1 localizes along the length of axons at
early stages of neuronal development in the rat and mouse, with
expression generally higher in and near growth cones of extending axons
and in distal regions. Katna1 expression declined upon neuronal
maturation.

GENE FUNCTION

Toyo-Oka et al. (2005) identified KATNA1 as a molecular target of NDEL1
(607538). Phosphorylation of Ndel1 by Cdk5 (123831) facilitated
interaction between NDEL1 and KATNA1, suggesting that phosphorylated
NDEL1 may regulate the distribution of KATNA1. Abnormal accumulation of
Katna1 in the nucleus of Ndel1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts
supported an essential role for NDEL1 in KATNA1 regulation. Complete
loss of Ndel1 or expression of dominant-negative Katna1 mutants in
migrating neurons resulted in defective migration and elongation of
nuclear-centrosomal distance. Toyo-Oka et al. (2005) suggested that
NDEL1 may be essential for mitotic cell division and neuronal migration,
not only via regulation of cytoplasmic dynein function, but also by
modulation of KATNA1 localization and function.

Postmitotic neurons require microtubules for dynamic scaffolding within
axons, dendrites, and growth cones. Microtubules are nucleated
exclusively at centrosomes and must be severed from the centrosome for
transport into the axon; shorter microtubules are transported along
axons more quickly than long microtubules. Using overexpression and
knockdown studies with cultured rodent neurons, Karabay et al. (2004)
showed that Katna1 is an active microtubule-severing enzyme with a
critical role in neuronal microtubule dynamics. Katna1 expression
dropped when axons were presented with target cells that caused them to
stop growing.

Iwaya et al. (2010) showed that the N-terminal microtubule interacting
and trafficking (MIT) domains of mouse and human KATNA1 bound
unpolymerized, but not polymerized, tubulin. The isolated MIT domain of
KATNA1 formed an antiparallel 3-stranded helix, with a hydrophobic core
of partly conserved alanine residues. Mutagenesis experiments revealed
that positively charged arg49 and lys67 of helix 3 are required for
tubulin binding. A coiled-coil region that follows the MIT domain
mediates dimer formation and when included in the protein fragment
interfered with binding of the MIT domain to tubulin.

Using cDNA constructs based on mouse p60 and p80 (602703), Iwaya et al.
(2012) showed that the N-terminal MIT domain of p60 interacted with the
C-terminal domain (CTD) of p80. Binding of either microtubules or the
p80-CTD to the p60 MIT domain stimulated the ATPase and
microtubule-severing activity of p60. Ca(2+) bound to a separate region
of the MIT domain of p60 and negatively regulated microtubule- or
p80-enhanced p60 activity. Ca(2+) did not inhibit the basal ATPase
activity of p60 or the binding of p60 to microtubules.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the KATNA1
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP EST392905).

Hartz (2012) mapped the KATNA1 gene to chromosome 6q25.1 based on the
alignment of the KATNA1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF056022) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;BRCC4;;
BRCC45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Li et al. (1995) cloned BRE from a placenta cDNA library. The deduced
protein contains 383 amino acids. Northern blot analysis of normal human
fibroblasts detected a single BRE mRNA at 1.7 to 1.9 kb. Northern blot
analysis of several rat tissues detected highest expression in testis
and intermediate expression in brain and ovary. Using the juxtamembrane
domain of the p55 TNF receptor (TNFRSF1A; 191190) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, Gu et al. (1998) cloned Bre from a mouse cerebellum
cDNA library.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1995) found that the expression of BRE decreased following
DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts caused by UV irradiation or
4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) exposure. Similar decreased BRE
expression was observed in retinoic acid-treated human brain glioma
cells and promyelocytic cells. BRE expression was unchanged in cells
following growth inhibition.

Using protein-binding assays and immunoprecipitation analysis in HEK293
cells, Gu et al. (1998) confirmed the interaction between mouse Bre and
Tnfrsf1a. Bre specifically interacted with Tnfrsf1a but not with other
TNF family members. Overexpression of Bre inhibited TNF-induced
NF-kappa-B activation.

Dong et al. (2003) demonstrated that in human cell lines BRE and BRCC3
(300617) are components of a holoenzyme complex containing BRCA1
(113705), BRCA2 (600185), BARD1 (601593), and RAD51 (179617), which they
called the BRCA1- and BRCA2-containing complex (BRCC). The complex
showed UBC5 (see UBE2D1; 602961)-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase activity.
Inclusion of BRE and BRCC3 enhanced ubiquitination by the complex, and
cancer-associated truncations in BRCA1 reduced the association of BRE
and BRCC3 with the complex. RNA interference of BRE and BRCC3 in HeLa
cells increased cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and resulted in a
defect in G2/M checkpoint arrest. Dong et al. (2003) concluded that the
BRCC is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that enhances cellular survival following
DNA damage.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the BRE

NFE2-ASSOCIATED POLYPEPTIDE 2; NAPP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Working with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Albertini et al. (1997) described
peroxin-14 (PEX14), the first membrane-bound peroxisomal protein that
binds to the peroxisomal type-2 targeting signal (PTS2) receptor, PEX7
(601757). Thus, the PEX14 protein may represent the functional docking
site for PTS2-dependent protein import to the peroxisome. In addition to
the interaction with the PTS2 receptor, PEX14 protein was found to
interact with PEX5 protein (600414), the PTS1 receptor. This observation
suggested the overlapping of 2 import pathways, with PEX14 being the
point of convergence. Moreover, PEX14 also interacted with 2 other
membrane-bound peroxins, including the SH3 domain protein PEX13
(601789), the putative docking protein for PTS1-dependent protein
import. Albertini et al. (1997) proposed that these 3 peroxins are
components of a common translocation machinery.

Using yeast Pex14 sequences to probe EST databases, Fransen et al.
(1998) identified a cDNA encoding PEX14. The deduced 377-amino acid
protein contains a nonmembrane-spanning hydrophobic region, a
coiled-coil region, and a charged, acidic C terminus; it has no class II
SH3-binding motif. Western blot analysis showed expression of a 57-kD
protein.

By searching an EST database using S. cerevisiae Pex14 as query, Will et
al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding PEX14 in a breast cell library.
The deduced protein contains 2 conserved coiled-coil region and has a
calculated molecular mass of about 41 kD. The human and yeast proteins
share 26% identity. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
2.1-kb transcript in all tissues examined. Western blot analysis of
human fibroblast and in vitro translated protein revealed an apparent
molecular mass of about 55 kD, which may reflect its high content of
acidic amino acids. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed
colocalization with peroxisomal catalase. PEX14 was found in the
particulate fraction of fractionated cells and resisted salt or alkali
extraction, suggesting that it is an integral membrane protein. Protease
protection assays indicated that the C terminus is cytosolic and that
the N terminus likely protrudes into the peroxisomal lumen.

Gavva et al. (2002) identified PEX14, which they called NAPP2, as a
protein in an erythroleukemia expression library that interacted with
nuclear factor erythroid-2 (NFE2; 601490). Northern blot analysis
revealed a transcript of about 2 kb expressed in all cell lines tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Ligand blot analysis by Fransen et al. (1998) determined that PEX14
binds to both the PTS1 receptor (PEX5) and weakly with the SH3 domain of
PEX13. Biochemical analysis indicated that PEX14 is required for the
import of PTS1-containing proteins into peroxisomes.

Will et al. (1999) found that Pex14 deficiency in S. cerevisiae could
not be rescued by expression of human PEX14, indicating that the
proteins are not functionally interchangeable. Overexpression of PEX14
in normal skin fibroblasts led to the decoration of tubular structures
and mislocalization of peroxisomal catalase to the cytosol. Unlike the
findings in yeast, PEX14 did not form homooligomers or interact with
PTS2 receptor or PEX13.

By in vitro binding assays of truncated recombinant proteins, Gavva et
al. (2002) found that interaction between PEX14 and NFE2 occurs through
the N-terminal 203 amino acids of PEX14 and the N-terminal 114 amino
acids of NFE2. Expression of PEX14 inhibited NFE2-directed
transcriptional activation. PEX14 also functioned as a corepressor and
interacted specifically with HDAC1 (601241), but not with HDAC2 (605164)
or HDAC3 (605166).

MAPPING

By FISH, Gavva et al. (2002) mapped the PEX14 gene to chromosome 1p36.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with Zellweger syndrome (PBD13A; 614887), Shimozawa et al.
(2004) identified a gln185-to-ter mutation in the PEX14 gene (Q185X;
601791.0001). Although PEX14 mutants had been identified in yeast and in
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, this was said to be the first
reported case of human PEX14 deficiency. Shimozawa et al. (2004) stated
that PEX14 is a member of the complementation group of peroxisome
biogenesis disorders, and designated it complementation group K. PEX14
rescued the import of a PTS1-dependent as well as a PTS2-dependent
protein into the peroxisomes in fibroblasts from the patient. The
patient's fibroblasts lacked PEX14, as determined by immunocytochemical
analysis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 13A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX14, GLN185TER

In an infant with Zellweger syndrome (PBD13A; 614887), Shimozawa et al.
(2004) identified a homozygous 553C-T transition in the PEX14 gene,
resulting in a gln185-to-ter (Q185X) substitution in a putative
coiled-coil region of the protein. At birth the patient showed typical
craniofacial dysmorphia of Zellweger syndrome, including large open
fontanels, high forehead, flat occiput, low/broad nasal bridge, and
micrognathia, as well as neurologic abnormalities including hypotonia.
Plasma analysis showed elevated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and
di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid, and a normal phytanic acid level.
Erythrocyte plasmalogens were undetectable. The patient died at 10 days
of age.

PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 13A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX14, 41-KB DEL

In a Pakistani patient with Zellweger syndrome (PBD13A; 614887), born of
related parents, Huybrechts et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 41-kb
deletion in the PEX14 gene, resulting in the deletion of exon 3,
frameshift, and premature protein truncation. Cultured skin fibroblasts
from the patient showed absence of PEX14 protein and absence of normal
peroxisomes. The patient had severe cholestasis and hepatomegaly,
neuronal migration defect, and progressive hypotonia.

;;NEUBLASTIN;;
ENOVIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Neurotrophic factors, such as GDNF (600837), NTN (602018), and PSPN
(602921), orchestrate multiple aspects of the development and
maintenance of the central and peripheral nervous systems. These GDNF
family ligands signal though a multicomponent receptor system composed
of a high affinity binding component, (GFRA1-GFRA4; see 601496) and a
common signaling component, the RET (164761) receptor tyrosine kinase.
By searching databases for sequences related to NTN, Baloh et al. (1998)
identified human and mouse genomic clones and cDNAs encoding a novel
member of the GDNF family, which they named Artemin. Northern blot
analysis revealed that Artemin is expressed at low levels in many
peripheral adult tissues. Using in situ hybridization analysis of rat
embryos at E14, the authors found that Artemin is expressed in regions
that are likely to influence the development of peripheral neurons, such
as the nerve roots, but not the developing neurons, of the dorsal root
ganglia. The predicted human Artemin protein contains a signal peptide
and a large proregion. The mature protein contains 113 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Baloh et al. (1998) demonstrated that Artemin, like GDNF and NTN,
supports the survival of neurons from all peripheral ganglia examined,
including sympathetic, neural crest, and placodally derived sensory
neurons. In addition, Artemin can support the survival of at least 1
population of central nervous system neurons, the dopaminergic midbrain
neurons. Artemin is a ligand for the GFR-alpha-3 (GRFA3; 605710)
coreceptor, which together with RET, represents the preferred
multicomponent receptor for Artemin signaling.

In a mouse model of neuropathic pain, Gardell et al. (2003) found that
systemic, intermittent administration of artemin produced dose- and
time-related reversal of nerve injury-induced pain behavior as well as
partial to complete normalization of multiple morphologic and
neurochemical features of the injury state. After spinal injury, there
was an increase in dorsal root ganglion cells that were GFR-alpha-3
reactive, the primary site of artemin action.

GENE STRUCTURE

Baloh et al. (1998) determined that the Artemin gene contains 3 introns.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Baloh et al. (1998) mapped the Artemin
gene to chromosome 1p33-p32.

ANIMAL MODEL

Honma et al. (2002) found that Artn- and Gfra3-deficient mice shared
abnormalities in the migration and axonal projection pattern of the
entire sympathetic nervous system, resulting in abnormal innervation of
target tissues and cell death due to lack of neurotrophic support. They
visualized Artn expression in transgenic mice expressing
fluorescence-tagged Artn in order to characterize these defects.
Fluorescence was detected along blood vessels and in cells nearby to
sympathetic axonal projections. Honma et al. (2002) confirmed the
chemoattractive properties of Artn by demonstrating that sympathetic
neuroblasts migrated and projected axons toward Artn-soaked beads
implanted into mouse embryos.

;;MANNOSIDASE, ALPHA B, LYSOSOMAL; MANB;;
LAMAN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Alpha-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24) is a lysosomal hydrolase that cleaves
alpha-linked mannose residues from the nonreducing end of N-linked
glycoproteins (Gotoda et al., 1998).

See also beta-mannosidase (MANBA; 609489).

CLONING

Nebes and Schmidt (1994) isolated and sequenced a cDNA for
alpha-mannosidase. Liao et al. (1996) used RT-PCR to clone 2 cDNAs
encoding human lysosomal alpha-mannosidase. The shorter of the 2 cDNAs
encodes a 3-kb open reading frame which, when expressed, produces a
functional alpha-mannosidase enzyme; the longer cDNA, encoding a 3.6-kb
open reading frame, produced no alpha-mannosidase activity when
expressed. Northern blot analysis identified a major 3-kb mRNA
transcript in all human tissues tested and a minor 3.6-kb mRNA
transcript in several adult tissues.

Nilssen et al. (1997) reported purification and characterization of
lysosomal alpha-mannosidase, which they symbolized LAMAN, from human
placenta. They found that the enzyme was synthesized as a single-chain
precursor which is processed into 3 glycopeptides of 70, 42, and 15 kD.
The 70-kD peptide is further partially proteolyzed into 3 more peptides
that are joined by disulfide bridges. The deduced amino acid sequence
contains a putative signal peptide of 48 amino acids followed by a
polypeptide sequence of 962 amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed
a single transcript of approximately 3.5 kb present in all tissues
examined, but at varying levels.

Berg et al. (1997) reported the purification of feline liver lysosomal
alpha-mannosidase and determination of its cDNA sequence. The active
enzyme consists of 3 polypeptides, with molecular masses of 72, 41, and
12 kD, joined by noncovalent forces. They demonstrated that the enzyme
is synthesized as a single-chain precursor with a putative signal
peptide of 50 amino acids followed by a polypeptide chain of 957 amino
acids, which is cleaved into the 3 polypeptides of the mature enzyme.
The deduced amino acid sequence was 81.1% and 83.2% identical with the
human and bovine sequences, respectively. Tollersrud et al. (1997)
purified the bovine kidney enzyme to homogeneity and cloned the gene.

GENE STRUCTURE

Riise et al. (1997) determined that the MANB gene spans 21.5 kb and
contains 24 exons. By primer extension analysis, the major transcription
initiation sites were mapped to positions -309, -196, and -191 relative
to the first in-frame ATG. No CAAT or TATA sequences were identified
within the 134 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, but the
5-prime flanking region contains several GC-rich regions with putative
binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 (189906), AP-2 (107580),
and ETF.

MAPPING

By analysis of human-mouse hybrid cells, Kaneda et al. (1987) assigned
the MANB gene to chromosome 19p13.2-q12. By PCR analysis of DNA from 2
human/rodent somatic cell hybrid mapping panels, Nebes and Schmidt
(1994) mapped the MANB gene to the proximal portion of chromosome 19. In
combination with earlier findings, the gene could be mapped to
19cen-q12.

Beccari et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Man2b1 gene to chromosome 8 using
the Jackson Laboratory interspecific panel DNA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 Palestinian sibs with alpha-mannosidosis (MANSA; 248500) originally
reported by Bach et al. (1978), Nilssen et al. (1997) identified a
homozygous mutation in the MAN2B1 gene (609458.0001).

In unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis, Gotoda et al. (1998)
identified 5 mutations in the MAN2B1 gene (609458.0001-609458.0005). All
mutations were either in the homozygous or compound heterozygous states.

In a screening of 43 patients with mannosidosis from 39 families, mainly
of European origin, Berg et al. (1999) identified 21 novel
disease-causing mutations in the MAN2B1 gene, and 4 polymorphic amino
acid variations. Disease-causing mutations were identified in 72% of the
patients' alleles and included 8 splicing, 6 missense, and 3 nonsense
mutations, as well as 2 small insertions and 2 small deletions. In
addition, Southern blot analysis indicated rearrangements in some
alleles. Most mutations were private or occurred in 2 or 3 families,
except for the R750W substitution (609458.0004), which was found in 13
patients from different European countries and accounted for 21% of the
disease alleles. No correlation between the types of mutations and the
clinical manifestations was evident.

Riise Stensland et al. (2012) identified 96 different pathogenic
mutations in the MAN2B1 gene, including 83 novel mutations, in 130
unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis from 30 countries. Most of
the mutations were private, but R750W was found in 50 patients from 16
countries and accounted for 27.3% of disease alleles. Haplotype analysis
indicated at least 4 independent events causing R750W, with 1 haplotype
accounting for 95% of the alleles. Population-based analysis suggested
that the mutant allele arose in eastern Europe. Other recurrent
mutations included a splice site mutation in intron 14 (609458.0006),
found in 13 disease alleles, and L809P (609458.0007), found in 8 disease
alleles. Twenty-nine novel missense mutations were identified. Most did
not show any residual enzyme activity when expressed in COS7 cells, but
10 showed some activity, including 5 with 30% or more residual activity.
There were no apparent genotype/phenotype correlations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Roces et al. (2004) reported correction of storage of neutral
oligosaccharides in a mouse model of alpha-mannosidosis after
intravenous administration of Man2b1 from bovine kidney and human and
mouse recombinant MAN2B1. The bovine and human enzymes were barely
phosphorylated, whereas the bulk of the mouse Man2b1 contained mannose
6-phosphate recognition markers. Clearance and apparent half-life of the
internalized enzyme was dependent on the enzyme source as well as tissue
type. The corrective effect was time-, tissue- and dose-dependent, and
the effects were observed to be transient. After a single dose injection
of MAN2B1, the maximum corrective effect was observed between 2 and 6
days. Injection of 250 microU of human MAN2B1 per gram of body weight
followed by a subsequent injection 3.5 days later was sufficient to
clear liver, kidney, and heart of neutral oligosaccharides. A decrease
in mannose-containing oligosaccharides was also observed in the brain,
with storage levels in treated mice less than 30% of levels found in
control mice.

Blanz et al. (2008) demonstrated that the neuropathology of a mouse
model for alpha-mannosidosis could be efficiently treated using
recombinant human alpha-mannosidase (rhLAMAN). After intravenous
administration of various doses (25-500 U/kg), rhLAMAN was widely
distributed among tissues, and immunohistochemistry revealed lysosomal
delivery of the injected enzyme. Whereas low doses (25 U/kg) led to a
greater than 70% clearance of stored substrates in visceral tissues and
doses of 250 U/kg were sufficient for clearance in peripheral neurons of
the trigeminal ganglion, repeated high-dose injections (500 U/kg) were
required to achieve a greater than 50% reduction of brain storage.
Successful transfer across the blood-brain barrier was evident as the
injected enzyme was found in hippocampal neurons, leading to nearly
complete disappearance of storage vacuoles. In addition, the decrease in
neuronal storage in the brain correlated with an improvement of the
neuromotor disabilities found in untreated alpha-mannosidosis mice.
Uptake of rhLAMAN seemed to be independent of mannose-6-phosphate
receptors, consistent with the low phosphorylation profile of the
enzyme.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, HIS71LEU

In 2 sibs with alpha-mannosidosis (MANSA; 248500), born of
consanguineous parents, Nilssen et al. (1997) identified a homozygous
212A-T transversion in exon 2 of the MANB gene, resulting in a
his71-to-leu (H71L) substitution. Residue his71 is conserved among
lysosomal alpha-mannosidases from several species. The sibs were thought
to be mildly affected and residual acidic alpha-mannosidase activity of
20% of normal was detected in the patient's fibroblasts, according to
the report of this family by Bach et al. (1978). Nevertheless, the
patients showed vacuolated leukocytes and fibroblasts consistent with
the disease phenotype. The authors suggested that mutant mannosidase
enzymes, even though containing residual activity upon testing at the
appropriate pH, may be mislocalized to nonlysosomal compartments and
therefore functionally inactive.

Gotoda et al. (1998) identified the same mutation, which they designated
HIS72LEU in keeping with the codon numbering system of Wakamatsu et al.
(1997). The patient, represented by cell line GM2051, was one of the
patients reported by Nilssen et al. (1997).

.0002
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, ARG760TER

In a 47-year-old Japanese woman with mannosidosis (248500), born to
first-cousin parents, Gotoda et al. (1998) identified a homozygous
C-to-T transition in exon 19 of the MAN2B1 gene, resulting in an
arg760-to-ter (R760X) substitution. The lysosomal alpha-mannosidase
activity of the peripheral leukocytes was decreased to less than 1% of
control values.

.0003
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, GLN639TER

In fibroblast cell lines from a 7-year-old Finnish boy with
alpha-mannosidosis (248500), who was originally described by Autio et
al. (1973), Gotoda et al. (1998) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the MAN2B1 gene: a C-to-T transition in exon 15,
resulting in a gln639-to-ter (Q639X) substitution, and a C-to-T
transition in exon 18, resulting in an arg750-to-trp substitution
(R750W; 609458.0004). Alpha-mannosidase activity was reduced to
approximately 2% of normal.

.0004
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, ARG750TRP

See 609458.0003 and Gotoda et al. (1998).

Berg et al. (1999) identified the arg750-to-trp (R750W) mutation in 13
patients with alpha-mannosidosis (248500) from different European
countries. R750W accounted for 21% of disease alleles.

Riise Stensland et al. (2012) identified the R750W mutation in 50 of 130
unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis from 30 countries. It was the
most common mutation, accounting for 27.3% of disease alleles. Haplotype
analysis indicated at least 4 independent events causing R750W, with 1
haplotype accounting for 95% of the alleles. Population-based analysis
suggested that the mutant allele arose in eastern Europe. The mutation
was found in patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease.

.0005
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, PRO356ARG

In a fibroblast cell line from a 2-year-old girl with severe
alpha-mannosidosis (248500), Gotoda et al. (1998) identified a
homozygous C-to-T transversion in exon 8 of the MAN2B1 gene, resulting
in a pro356-to-arg (P356R) substitution. The patient showed severe
growth failure with hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, and
hepatosplenomegaly.

.0006
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, IVS14DS, G-C, +1

In a study of 130 unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis (248500)
from 30 countries, Riise Stensland et al. (2012) found that a G-to-C
transversion in intron 14 (IVS14+1G-C) of the MAN2B1 gene (Berg et al.,
1999) was present on 13 disease alleles, making it the second most
common mutation after R750W (609458.0004).

.0007
ALPHA-MANNOSIDOSIS
MAN2B1, LEU809PRO

In a study of 130 unrelated patients with alpha-mannosidosis (248500)
from 30 countries, Riise Stensland et al. (2012) found that a 2426T-C
transition in exon 20 of the MAN2B1 gene (Berg et al., 1999) was present
on 8 disease alleles, making it the third most common mutation after
R750W (609458.0004) and a splice site mutation in intron 14
(609458.0006).

609867	TITLE *609867 UBIQUITIN-LIKE DOMAIN-CONTAINING CTD PHOSPHATASE 1; UBLCP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

During large-scale cDNA sequencing, Zheng et al. (2005) cloned a novel
phosphatase, which they named ubiquitin-like domain-containing CTD
phosphatase-1 (UBLCP1), from a human fetal brain cDNA library. UBLCP1
encodes a 318-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 36.8
kD. It has a CTD phosphatase catalytic domain containing several
residues essential for catalytic activity that are conserved with those
in the CTD phosphatases CTDSP1 (605323) and CTDP1 (604927). UBLCP1 also
contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain that harbors a
proteasome-interacting motif. RT-PCR detected relatively high expression
of UBLCP1 in placenta, lung, testis, and ovary, with weaker expression
in heart, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, colon, and peripheral blood
leukocytes. UBLCP1 expression was particularly high in breast, lung,
colon, prostate, ovarian, and pancreas tumor tissues. Immunofluorescence
analysis localized UBLCP1 to the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro phosphatase assays, Zheng et al. (2005) demonstrated that
UBLCP1 shows magnesium-dependent phosphatase activity towards the
substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate that is optimal at pH 5. In vitro
assays also showed that UBLCP1 dephosphorylates the C-terminal domain of
RNA polymerase II (180660), with highest activity at serine-5.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zheng et al. (2005) determined that the UBLCP1 gene contains 11 exons
spanning over 22.7 kb.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Zheng et al. (2005) mapped the UBLCP1 gene to
chromosome 5q33.3.

600442	TITLE *600442 AQUAPORIN 5; AQP5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aquaporin water channels, such as AQP5, play a fundamental role in
transmembrane water movement in plant and animal tissues (see AQP1;
107776).

CLONING

Since the molecular pathway by which water is secreted by salivary
glands was unknown, Raina et al. (1995) isolated cDNA from rat
submandibular gland by homology cloning. In vitro translation yielded a
27-kD polypeptide, and expression of the cRNA in Xenopus oocytes
conferred a 20-fold increase in osmotic water permeability, which was
reversibly inhibited by HgCl(2). Northern blot analysis demonstrated a
1.6-kb mRNA in submandibular, parotid, and sublingual salivary glands,
lacrimal gland, eye, trachea, and lung. In situ hybridization
demonstrated strong hybridization over the corneal epithelium of the eye
and over the secretory lobules in salivary glands. This member of the
mammalian aquaporin water channel family, designated AQP5, was
implicated in the generation of saliva, tears, and pulmonary secretions.

Lee et al. (1996) isolated and characterized the human AQP5 cDNA and
gene. The AQP5 cDNA from a human submaxillary gland library contained a
795-bp open reading frame encoding a 265-amino acid polypeptide. The
deduced amino acid sequences of human and rat AQP5 are 91% identical,
with 6 substitutions in the 22-amino acid COOH-terminal domain. Lee et
al. (1996) identified a transcription initiation site 518 bp upstream of
the initiating methionine.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lee et al. (1996) mapped the AQP5
gene to chromosome 12q13. The AQP5 gene resides within a 7.4-kb
SalI-EcoRI restriction fragment. The homologous mouse gene was localized
to distal chromosome 15.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (1996) showed that microinjection of human AQP5 in Xenopus
oocytes conferred mercurial-sensitive osmotic water permeability
equivalent to other aquaporins.

Tsubota et al. (2001) examined the distribution of AQP5 in lacrimal
gland biopsy specimens. Healthy controls and patients with either
Mikulicz disease or non-Sjogren syndrome dry eye had the expected apical
distribution of AQP5 in lacrimal acinar cells. Patients with Sjogren
syndrome, however, had diffuse cytoplasmic staining for AQP5, with
almost no labeling at the apical membrane. Sodium channel and
sodium-potassium ATPase distribution were normal in all groups. Tsubota
et al. (2001) concluded that there is a selective defect in lacrimal
gland AQP5 trafficking in Sjogren syndrome that might contribute to
decreased lacrimation and dry eye in these patients.

Sidhaye et al. (2006) observed a dose-responsive decrease in Aqp5
abundance in mouse lung epithelial cells exposed to hypotonic medium.
Hypotonic reduction of Aqp5 was augmented and reduced, respectively, by
conditions that activated or inhibited Trpv4 (605427). Hypotonic
reduction of Aqp5 required extracellular calcium and was associated with
increased intracellular calcium. The response to hypotonicity was
recapitulated by coexpression of TRPV4 and AQP5 in human embryonic
kidney cells. Sidhaye et al. (2006) concluded that AQP5 abundance is
tightly controlled along a spectrum of extracellular osmolalities and
that its abundance in hypotonic conditions can be regulated by TRPV4
activation.

By immunohistochemistry, Blaydon et al. (2013) observed strong
localization of AQP5 to the plasma membrane in keratinocytes of the
stratum granulosum. Levels of AQP5 in the palmar epidermis were much
lower than those seen in cells of the sweat glands.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using linkage data in combination with exome sequencing followed by
Sanger sequencing in families segregating autosomal dominant diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (PPKB; 600231), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for 5 different missense mutations in the AQP5 gene
(600442.0001-600442.0005) in affected members of 7 Swedish families, 3
British families, and a Scottish family. The mutations all segregated
with disease in the respective families and were not found in the dbSNP
or 1000 Genomes Project databases. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed
that the mutant AQP5 variants retained the ability to traffic to the
plasma membrane; the analyses also showed an increase in levels of
acetylated alpha-tubulin (see 602529) in a patient palm biopsy compared
to a control palm, suggesting increased levels of microtubule
stabilization in diffuse NEPPK palmar epidermis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ma et al. (2000) presented results from studies of Aqp5-null knockout
mice indicating that AQP5 is responsible for the majority of water
transport across the apical membrane of type I alveolar epithelial
cells. The unimpaired alveolar fluid clearance in Aqp5-null mice
indicated that high alveolar water permeability is not required for
active, near-isosmolar fluid transport. King et al. (2000) stated that 5
aquaporin-null phenotypes had been reported: AQP0, AQP1, AQP2, AQP4, and
AQP5.

Nejsum et al. (2002) studied the localization of AQPs 1 through 5 in rat
and mouse skin and sweat glands and investigated the potential roles of
AQPs in sweat secretion. The studies demonstrated that AQP5 resides in
plasma membranes of sweat secretory cells and is essential for sweat
secretion. Aqp5-null mice showed no apparent differences in the number
or morphologic appearance of sweat glands. However, these mice showed a
marked reduction in pilocarpine-induced sweat response. Nejsum et al.
(2002) raised the possibility that dysregulation of AQP5 in sweat glands
may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypohidrosis observed in patients
with Sjogren syndrome (270150) who show markedly decreased sweating in
response to methacholine stimulation. In contrast, hyperhidrosis
(144110) is a chronic idiopathic disorder of excessive sweating which
may affect the palms, axillae, soles, and face. They suggested that AQP5
inhibition may be a therapeutic option in these patients.

Two AQP water channels are expressed in mammalian cornea, AQP1 in
endothelial cells and AQP5 in epithelial cells. Thiagarajah and Verkman
(2002) examined the effect of Aqp1 or Aqp5 knockout in mice. Corneal
thickness in fixed sections was reduced in Aqp1 null mice and increased
in Aqp5 null mice. After exposure of the external corneal surface to
hypotonic saline, the rate of corneal swelling was reduced by Aqp5
deletion. After exposure of the endothelial surface to hypotonic saline
by anterior chamber perfusion, the rate of corneal swelling was reduced
by Aqp1 deletion. The recovery of corneal transparency and thickness
after hypotonic swelling was delayed in Aqp1 null mice. Thiagarajah and
Verkman (2002) concluded that AQP1 and AQP5 provide the principal routes
for corneal water transport across the endothelial and epithelial
barriers, respectively.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ALA38GLU

In affected individuals of 7 Swedish families with Bothnian-type diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (PPKB; 600231), including a family previously
studied by Lind et al. (1994), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.113C-A transversion in exon 1 of the AQP5 gene,
resulting in an ala38-to-glu (A38E) substitution at a residue located on
the extracellular surface of the protein. The mutation segregated with
disease in each family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes
Project databases. Affected individuals carrying the A38E mutation all
shared the same haplotype, indicating that A38E represents a founder
mutation. In 1 of the Swedish families, however, most affected
individuals carried a different missense mutation in AQP5 (R188C;
600442.0002); the A38E founder mutation was present in only 1 branch of
the family and was inherited from an affected individual who married
into the family.

.0002
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ARG188CYS

In affected individuals of a Swedish family with Bothnian-type diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (600231), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.562C-T transition in exon 3 of the AQP5 gene,
resulting in an arg188-to-cys (R188C) substitution at a highly conserved
residue lining the extracellular end of the water channel. The mutation,
which was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes Project databases,
segregated with disease in most of the family. In 1 branch of the
family, however, affected individuals carried the A38E founder mutation
(600442.0001), which was inherited from an affected individual who
married into the family.

.0003
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ILE45SER

In affected individuals of 2 families of British descent with
Bothnian-type diffuse nonepidermolytic PPK (600231), Blaydon et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a c.134T-G transversion in exon 1
of the AQP5 gene, resulting in an ile45-to-ser (I45S) substitution at a
residue lining the extracellular end of the water channel. The mutation
segregated with disease in both families and was not found in the dbSNP
or 1000 Genomes Project databases.

.0004
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ILE177PHE

In affected members of a large British family with Bothnian-type diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (600231), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.529A-T transversion in exon 3 of the AQP5 gene,
resulting in an ile177-to-phe (I177F) substitution at a residue lining
the extracellular end of the water channel. The mutation segregated with
disease in the family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes
Project databases.

.0005
PALMOPLANTAR KERATODERMA, BOTHNIAN TYPE
AQP5, ASN123ASP

In affected members of a family from Scotland with Bothnian-type diffuse
nonepidermolytic PPK (600231), Blaydon et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.367A-G transition in exon 2 of the AQP5 gene,
resulting in an asn123-to-asp (N123D) substitution at a residue located
on the extracellular surface of the protein. The mutation segregated
with disease in the family and was not found in the dbSNP or 1000
Genomes Project databases.

;;BNIP2-SIMILAR; BNIPS;;
BNIPL1;;
BNIPL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis using full-length BNIP2 (603292) or its BNIP2 and
CDC42GAP (ARHGAP1; 602732) homology (BCH) domain as probe, followed by
5-prime RACE of human kidney epithelial cells, Zhou et al. (2002) cloned
BNIPL, which they called BNIPS. They identified 2 alternative splicing
isoforms, a deduced 275-amino acid BNIPS-alpha isoform and a deduced
204-amino acid BNIPS-beta isoform. The BNIPS-alpha isoform shared 46%
identity with BNIP2 with higher similarity over the BCH domain, which is
predicted to comprise several alpha helices. PCR analysis detected
differing levels of expression of the BNIPS-alpha and BNIPS-beta
isoforms in a number of human cancer cell lines including breast cancer
MCF-7, HeLa cells, 293T embryonic transformed kidney epithelial cells,
and stomach and colon cancer cell lines. PCR analysis of mouse tissues
detected expression of BNIPS-alpha in all tissues examined.
Immunofluorescence studies localized the BNIPS-alpha isoform to the
cytosol and BNIPS-beta primarily to the nucleus.

Using a high-throughput transfection screen for suppressors of cell
growth from a human placental cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE,
Qin et al. (2003) independently cloned BNIPL. They identified 2
alternatively spliced isoforms that used different start codons: a
deduced 275-amino acid isoform, BNIPL1, isoform identical to the
BNIPS-alpha isoform isolated by Zhou et al. (2002) and a longer
357-amino acid isoform, BNIPL2, containing 82 additional N-terminal
amino acids, followed by the 275-amino acid sequence identical to
BNIPL1. By Northern blot analysis of human tissues, Shen et al. (2003)
detected a 2.4-kb BNIPL transcript in placenta and lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhou et al. (2002) showed that overexpression of the BNIPS-alpha isoform
in human breast cancer cells caused cell rounding, which was accompanied
by annexin V (ANXA5; 131230) binding, cell shrinkage, and detachment.
BNIPS-beta showed no change in cell morphology. The BCH domain was
required for proapoptotic activity. Zhou et al. (2002) concluded that
BNIPS-alpha induces apoptosis.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and pull-down affinity studies, Qin et al. (2003)
showed that the BCH domain of the BNIPL2 isoform interacted with Bcl2
(151430), Cdc42GAP, and with itself. They demonstrated that the BCH
domain was responsible for the ability of BNIPL2 to suppress GAP
activity of Cdc42GAP toward CDC42 (116952) and for the proapoptotic
function of BNIPL2. Shen et al. (2003) showed that overexpression of
BNIPL inhibited cell growth in human hepatocarcinoma cells. Using in
vivo and in vitro assays, they found that BNIPL interacted with MIF
(153620) and GFER (600924).

GENE STRUCTURE

Qin et al. (2003) determined that the BNIPL gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Qin et al. (2003) mapped the BNIPL gene to

191311	TITLE *191311 DISCOIDIN DOMAIN RECEPTOR FAMILY, MEMBER 2; DDR2
;;NEUROTROPHIC TYROSINE KINASE RECEPTOR-RELATED 3; NTRKR3;;
TYROSINE KINASE RECEPTOR RELATED TO NEUROTROPHIC TRK; TKT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a PCR-mediated approach, Karn et al. (1993) characterized cDNAs
from human and mouse representing a novel type of receptor protein
tyrosine kinase (RTK). The deduced 855-amino acid sequence of the
longest ORF has a unique extracellular region encompassing a factor
VIII-like domain, not previously described for RTKs. The most closely
related RTKs are members of the neurotrophin receptors (TRKs; see TRKA,
191315), which show 47 to 49% homology with the kinase domain of the
novel RTK. Therefore, Karn et al. (1993) called the novel gene TKT
(pronounced 'ticket') for 'tyrosine-kinase related to TRK.' TKT
orthologs from man and mouse are 98% similar. Northern blot analysis
detected a 10-kb transcript that was highly expressed in heart and lung,
with lower expression in brain, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and
kidney. In mouse, highest expression was also detected in heart and
lung, with lower expression in brain and testis.

Using in situ hybridization with 1-week-old mice, Labrador et al. (2001)
found that Ddr2 was expressed along chondrocyte columns in the
proliferative region of the growth plate. Ddr2 mRNA was also present,
although dispersed, at areas of calcified cartilage in the
cartilage-bone junction, as well as in the trabecular bone surface. Ddr2
protein was detected in most mouse tissues examined. Highest levels of
phosphorylated Ddr2 were detected in lung, ovary, and skin, which did
not correlate with Ddr2 protein levels.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/mouse somatic cell hybrids using PCR with primers
that amplified human but not mouse genomic DNA, Karn et al. (1993)
demonstrated that the TKT gene segregates with human chromosome 1 and is
located in the region 1q12-qter.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bargal et al. (2009) mapped the short limb-hand type of
spondyloepiphyseal-metaphyseal dysplasia (SMED-SL; 271665) to a region
on chromosome 1 that included that DDR2 gene. They considered DDR2 to be
a strong candidate for the disorder because of the similarity between
the phenotype of the Ddr2 knockout mouse and that of SMED-SL patients.
In 8 patients from 7 different consanguineous families with SMED-SL,
they identified homozygous missense mutations in exon 17 of the DDR2
gene: an R752C substitution (191311.0001) in 6 Arab Muslims living in
the Jerusalem area, an I726R (191311.0002) substitution in 1 Algerian,
and a T713I (191311.0003) substitution in 1 Pakistani. Bargal et al.
(2009) also identified a splice site mutation (191311.0004) in the DDR2
gene, which resulted in the skipping of exon 17, in one of the Jewish
families with SMED-SL originally reported by Borochowitz et al. (1993).
All of the mutations occurred in the active site of the DDR2 tyrosine
kinase domain.

Ali et al. (2010) reported homozygous DDR2 missense mutations in 2
consanguineous families with SMED-SL in the United Arab Emirates. One
was a novel mutation (E113K; 191311.0005) in 2 sibs from a family of
Pakistani origin, and the other the R752C mutation (191311.0001) in 2
Egyptian sibs. The authors expressed DDR2 constructs with the identified
point mutations in human cell lines and evaluated their localization and
functional properties. All SMED-SL missense mutants were defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation, and the 3 missense mutations
reported by Bargal et al. (2009) were retained in the endoplasmic
reticulum. In contrast, the novel mutation trafficked normally but
failed to bind collagen.

ANIMAL MODEL

Labrador et al. (2001) obtained Ddr2 -/- mice at the expected mendelian
ratio. Ddr2 -/- mice appeared normal at birth, but they failed to
thrive, resulting in proportionate smaller body size and reduced body
mass. They developed a progressive skeletal phenotype characterized by
shortening of long bones, irregular growth of flat bones, and shorter
snout. Reduced bone growth in Ddr2 -/- mice appeared to be due to
reduced chondrocyte proliferation rather than apoptosis or a defect in
chondrocyte differentiation. Ddr2 -/- embryonic fibroblasts and Ddr2 -/-
adult skin fibroblasts proliferated more slowly and showed a diminished
wounding response compared with wildtype fibroblasts.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPONDYLOMETAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, SHORT LIMB-HAND TYPE
DDR2, ARG752CYS

In 6 patients with the short limb-hand type of spondylometaepiphyseal
dysplasia (271665) from 5 Arab Muslim families living in the Jerusalem
area, Bargal et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for a 2254C-T
transition in exon 17 of the DDR2 gene, resulting in an arg752-to-cys
(R752C) substitution. All of the parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 200 chromosomes of matched healthy
unrelated individuals. Haplotype analysis indicated that this is a
founder mutation.

Ali et al. (2010) found that the 2 affected sibs from the consanguineous
Egyptian family originally reported by Al-Gazali et al. (1996) carried
the R752C mutation in homozygosity. Both sibs died, one of respiratory
failure at age 13 years and the other of cord compression at age 8
years. In severity the phenotype was similar to the patients described
by Bargal et al. (2009).

Ali et al. (2010) expressed R752C mutant protein in human cells and
found that it was retained in endoplasmic reticulum and was defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation.

.0002
SPONDYLOMETAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, SHORT LIMB-HAND TYPE
DDR2, ILE726ARG

In an Algerian patient with spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia, short
limb-hand type (271665), Bargal et al. (2009) identified homozygosity
for a 2177T-G transversion in exon 17 of the DDR2 gene, resulting in an
ile726-to-arg (I726R) substitution. The parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 200 chromosomes of matched healthy
unrelated individuals.

Ali et al. (2010) expressed I726R mutant protein in human cells and
found that it was retained in endoplasmic reticulum and was defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation.

.0003
SPONDYLOMETAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, SHORT LIMB-HAND TYPE
DDR2, THR713ILE

In a Pakistani patient with spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia, short
limb-hand type (271665), Bargal et al. (2009) identified homozygosity
for a 2138C-T transition in exon 17 of the DDR2 gene, resulting in a
thr713-to-ile (T713I) substitution. The parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 200 chromosomes of matched healthy
unrelated individuals.

Ali et al. (2010) expressed T713I mutant protein in human cells and
found that it was retained in endoplasmic reticulum and was defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation.

.0004
SPONDYLOMETAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, SHORT LIMB-HAND TYPE
DDR2, IVS17, G-A, +1

In the parents of the affected members of one of the original
consanguineous Jewish families with spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia,
short limb-hand type (271665), described by Borochowitz et al. (1993),
Bargal et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for an IVS17+1G-A
mutation in the DDR2 gene, which resulted in the skipping of exon 17.

.0005
SPONDYLOMETAEPIPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA, SHORT LIMB-HAND TYPE
DDR2, GLU113LYS

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous Pakistani family with
spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia, short limb-hand type (271665), Ali et
al. (2010) detected homozygosity for a c.337G-A transition in DDR2
resulting in a glu-to-lys substitution at codon 113 (E113K). The E113K
mutation is located in the extracellular discoidin domain and affects a
surface-exposed residue important in the DDR2 collagen-binding site. The
brothers had bowing of lower limbs in addition to short limbs and hands.
Both had repeated respiratory infections. Neurologic development was
normal in both.

Ali et al. (2010) expressed E113K mutant protein in human cells and
found that, while it trafficked normally, it was defective in
collagen-induced receptor activation and failed to bind collagen.

606397	TITLE *606397 CLARIN 1; CLRN1
;;USH3A GENE; USH3A;;
USH3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching and sequencing of the Usher syndrome type IIIA
(276902) critical region on chromosome 3q21-q25, Joensuu et al. (2001)
identified several genes, including CLRN1, which they called USH3A gene.
The USH3A protein has a cytosolic N terminus, 2 helical transmembrane
domains, and an endoplasmic reticulum membrane retention signal, TKGH,
in the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression
of 3 USH3A transcripts of 4.5 kb, 1.4 kb, and 2.0 kb in adult human
tissues. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in retina. No expression of
USH3A was detected in human lymphoblasts by either method.

Fields et al. (2002) found that the USH3A gene encodes a deduced
232-amino acid protein. The mature form of the protein is predicted to
contain 3 transmembrane domains and 204 residues.

Adato et al. (2002) assembled a 500-kb genomic interval spanning the
USH3A gene and determined the full-length coding sequence of the USH3A
gene, expected to encode a 232-amino acid protein with 4 transmembrane
domains, which they named clarin-1. Adato et al. (2002) detected
expression of USH3A in retina, skeletal muscle, testis, and olfactory
epithelium. In mouse inner ear, expression was specific to the inner and
outer hair cells of the organ of Corti and to the spiral ganglion cells.

By sequencing CLRN1 clones obtained from a human retina cDNA library,
Vastinsalo et al. (2011) identified 10 alternative splice variants in
addition to the main variant, which contains exons 0, 2, and 3 and
encodes a 232-amino acid protein. Other transcripts containing ORFs were
predicted to encode proteins of 30 to 245 amino acids, and all but the
30-amino acid peptide have 1 to 4 transmembrane segments. Some splice
variants include premature stop codons and may be untranslated. EST
database analysis suggested that exon 2 may also be spliced onto
additional downstream exons. PCR analysis detected weak expression of
the main CLRN1 variant in most tissues examined. The variant encoding
the 245-amino acid protein was detected in retina, cochlea, heart,
brain, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and ovary.

GENE STRUCTURE

Joensuu et al. (2001) determined that the CLRN1 gene contains 4 exons
spanning approximately 18 kb of genomic DNA. They also identified a
splice variant, designated isoform b, comprising an additional 87-bp
exon (exon 1b).

Fields et al. (2002) provided a revised structure of the CLRN1 gene,
including a new translation start site, 5-prime untranslated region, and
a transcript encoding a 232-amino acid protein. They stated that no
portion of exon 1, exon 1b, or exon 4 was present in their revised CLRN1
cDNA.

Adato et al. (2002) determined the genomic structure and alternative
transcripts of the CLRN1 gene. A longer transcript than those reported
by Joensuu et al. (2001) began with a newly identified exon 0, continued
with exon 2, had exons 3 and 4 transcribed together with their
intervening intron, but did not include the previously identified exons
1 and 1b.

Vastinsalo et al. (2011) determined that the CLRN1 gene contains at
least 8 exons, which they termed exons 0, 0b, 1, 1b, 2, 2b, 3a, and 3b.
Exons 3a and 3b are joined, along with the intervening intron, to form
exon 3 in the main splice variant. The region upstream of exon 1, which
is not transcribed in the main variant, contains a CpG island. Regions
upstream of exons 0, 1, 2, and 3 contain putative transcription
factor-binding sites. Functional analysis revealed that highest promoter
activity was associated with the region upstream of exon 0. A
pseudogene, CLRN1OS, is located on the opposite strand and has a 5-prime
UTR running in the opposite direction and overlapping the 5-prime UTR of
the CLRN1 gene.

GENE FAMILY

Adato et al. (2002) performed sequence database searches and identified
2 additional clarin-1 human paralogs: clarin-2 and clarin-3. No
orthologs were identified in the genomes of prokaryotes, yeast, plants,
nematodes, and insects, suggesting that this gene family is limited to
vertebrates. Four transmembrane domains, conserved sequence motifs, and
a single glycosylation consensus site between TM1 and TM2 characterized
the clarin family members, with a total of 14 identified clarins in
different species. In a wider context the clarins appeared to belong to
a large superfamily of small integral membrane glycoproteins with 4
transmembrane domains, including connexins and claudins, previously
shown to be involved in forms of deafness. The only protein showing
significant sequence similarity to the 3 clarins was stargazin, a
cellular synapse protein encoded by the CACNG2 gene (602911). Because of
the sequence homology to stargazin, Adato et al. (2002) suggested a role
for clarin-1 in hair cell and photoreceptor cell synapses.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Joensuu et al. (2001) mapped the CLRN1 gene to
chromosome 3q21-q25. Fields et al. (2002) stated 3q25 as the cytogenetic
location of the CLRN1 gene.

Fields et al. (2002) showed that the orthologous gene in the mouse is on
chromosome 3 and in rat on chromosome 2. They identified 2 human
paralogs on chromosomes 4 and 10.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Usher Syndrome Type IIIA

In 2 Finnish families reported by Sankila et al. (1995) and Joensuu et
al. (1996) and an Italian family reported by Gasparini et al. (1998)
with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902), Joensuu et al. (2001) identified
mutations in the USH3A gene (606397.0001-606397.0003).

Fields et al. (2002) described 4 novel disease-causing mutations in the
USH3A gene, including one that appeared to be relatively common in the
Ashkenazi Jewish population (N48K; 606937.0004).

Adato et al. (2002) detected 3 USH3A mutations among 11 affected
individuals from 6 families with Usher syndrome type IIIA. They were a
missense mutation (606397.0004), a nonsense mutation (606397.0006), and
a 23-bp deletion (606397.0007), likely rendering clarin-1 functionally
inactive.

Aller et al. (2004) screened for mutations in the USH3A gene in Spanish
patients with Usher syndrome and found mutations in only 2 families.
They identified 1 patient with Usher syndrome type IIIA who was
homozygous for a C40G mutation (606397.0008). They noted that only 1
other mutation had been reported in the USH3A gene in Spanish families
with Usher syndrome (606397.0006). These 2 families accounted for only
1.7% of Spanish families with Usher syndrome.

- Retinitis Pigmentosa 61

In affected members of 2 consanguineous Pakistani families segregating
nonsyndromic autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP61; 614180),
Khan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for missense mutations in the
CLRN1 gene (606397.0009-606397.0010), both of which occurred in a
transmembrane domain. Khan et al. (2011) concluded that these
RP-associated mutations might represent hypomorphic mutations, because
the substituted amino acids located in the transmembrane domains
remained polar, whereas more severe changes had been detected in
patients with USH3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Geng et al. (2009) developed a Clrn1 -/- mouse model for Usher syndrome
type IIIA. Clrn1 was expressed as early as embryonic day 16.5 in the
auditory and vestibular hair cells and associated ganglionic neurons,
with its expression being higher in outer hair cells than inner hair
cells. Clrn1 -/- mice showed early-onset hearing loss that rapidly
progressed to severe levels. Two to 3 weeks after birth (postnatal day
14 to 21), Clrn1-null mice showed elevated auditory-evoked brainstem
response (ABR) thresholds and prolonged peak and interpeak latencies. By
postnatal day 21, approximately 70% of Clrn1-null mice had no detectable
ABR, and by postnatal day 30, these mice were deaf. Distortion product
otoacoustic emissions were not recordable from Clrn1-null mice.
Vestibular function in Clrn1-null mice mirrored the cochlear phenotype,
although it deteriorated more gradually than cochlear function.
Disorganization of outer hair cell stereocilia was seen as early as
postnatal day 2 and by postnatal day 21 outer hair cell loss was
observed. Geng et al. (2009) concluded that CLRN1 is necessary for hair
cell function and associated neural activation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, TYR176TER

Fields et al. (2002) demonstrated that the Fin(major) USH3A mutation in
exon 3 of the USH3A gene, which had been identified by Joensuu et al.
(2001) as 300C-T (TYR100TER), should be referred to as 528T-G, resulting
in a tyr176-to-ter substitution. Joensuu et al. (2001) had identified
homozygosity for this mutation in a Finnish family segregating Usher
syndrome type IIIA (276902) and found it in a further 52 Finnish
patients. Fields et al. (2002) found this mutation in 11 of 28 mutated
alleles from affected individuals of Finnish and other northern European
ancestry.

.0002
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, MET120LYS

In 4 Finnish patients from 2 families segregating Usher syndrome type
IIIA (276902), Joensuu et al. (2001) identified heterozygosity for the
Fin(major) mutation (606397.0001) and a T-to-A transversion resulting in
a met-to-lys substitution. Whereas Joensuu et al. (2001) referred to
this mutation, designated Fin(minor), as 131T-A (MET44LYS), Fields et
al. (2002) showed that this mutation should be referred to as 359T-A
(met120 to lys; M120K). The mutation occurred in exon 1 of the USH3A
gene.

.0003
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, 3-BP DEL, 459ATT

In a consanguineous Italian family segregating Usher syndrome type IIIA
(276902), Joensuu et al. (2001) identified a 3-bp deletion in exon 3 of
the USH3A gene, resulting in the substitution of one methionine for
isoleucine and leucine. Fields et al. (2002) showed that this mutation,
referred to as 231-233delATT by Joensuu et al. (2001), should be
referred to as 459-461delATT.

.0004
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, ASN48LYS

Of a total of 28 mutated alleles of the USH3A gene detected by Fields et
al. (2002) in patients with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902), 11 had a
missense mutation, asn48 to lys (N48K), due to a 144T-G transversion in
exon 1. The mutation occurred only in Ashkenazi Jewish subjects and was
present in homozygous state in all except 1, in whom it was found in
compound heterozygous state with a leu150-to-pro mutation (L150P;
606397.0005).

Adato et al. (2002) detected the N48K missense mutation in 6 affected
individuals from 4 unrelated families of Eastern European Jewish origin.
Five patients were homozygous, while 1 patient carried the substitution
only on 1 allele and the second USH3A mutation was not detected. Shared
microsatellite and SNP haplotypes on carrier chromosomes suggested the
existence of a founder effect for this mutation.

In a cohort of 40 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with Usher syndrome, Ness et
al. (2003) found that the 16 (40%) who were clinically classified as
having Usher syndrome type III were homozygous for the N48K mutation.
The carrier frequency of N48K was 0.7% (95% CI = 0.0-1.6%) among
Ashkenazi Jews in the New York area, with a predicted Usher syndrome
type III prevalence of 1.2 per 100,000. Despite the genetic homogeneity
of Usher syndrome type III in this group, there was a wide range of
phenotypic severity displayed by the N48K homozygotes. Age at onset of
the auditory phenotype varied from infancy to more than 35 years. A
56-year-old woman had onset of the ocular phenotype in early childhood
ending with no useful vision, whereas hearing loss began after age 35
years, progressing to moderate to severe.

.0005
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, LEU150PRO

In an Ashkenazi Jewish subject with type IIIA Usher syndrome (276902)
who was living in the United States, Fields et al. (2002) found that the
common Jewish mutation asn48 to lys (606397.0004) was combined, in
compound heterozygous state, with a 449T-C transition in exon 3,
resulting in a leu150-to-pro (L150P) mutation.

.0006
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, TYR63TER

Adato et al. (2002) detected a 189C-A substitution, which was expected
to cause a tyr63-to-ter (Y63X) nonsense mutation in homozygous state in
3 sibs with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902) from a nonconsanguineous
Spanish family.

Aller et al. (2004) stated that the family with the Y63X mutation
reported by Adato et al. (2002) could be diagnosed clinically as Usher
syndrome type I because hearing impairment was profound and stable.
Aller et al. (2004) considered that progressive hearing loss is not the
definitive parameter in distinguishing Usher syndrome type III from
Usher syndrome types I and II.

.0007
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, 23-BP DEL, NT187

In 2 sibs with Usher syndrome type IIIA (276902) from a
nonconsanguineous family of Yemenite Jewish origin, Adato et al. (2002)
detected a 23-bp deletion in homozygous state. The deletion spanned
nucleotides 187-209 downstream from the first methionine codon, and was
predicted to cause a frameshift at amino acid 63 and stop codon after 25
amino acids.

.0008
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIA
CLRN1, CYS40GLY

In a patient with type IIIA Usher syndrome, Aller et al. (2004)
identified homozygosity for a 118T-G transversion, resulting in a
cys40-to-gly (C40G) mutation in the USH3A gene. Both parents and an
unaffected sister were heterozygous for the mutation.

.0009
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 61
CLRN1, LEU154TRP

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with
nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP61; 614180), Khan et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 461T-G transversion in exon 3 of the CLRN1
gene, resulting in a leu154-to-trp (L154W) substitution in a
transmembrane domain. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated
retention of the mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas
the wildtype protein was mainly present at the cell membrane. The
mutation was not found in 81 unrelated Pakistani RP patients or in 90
ethnically matched control individuals.

.0010
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 61
CLRN1, PRO31LEU

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with
nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP61; 614180), Khan et al. (2011)
identified homozygosity for a 92C-T transition in exon 1 of the CLRN1
gene, resulting in a pro31-to-leu (P31L) substitution in a transmembrane
domain. Subcellular localization studies demonstrated retention of the
mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the wildtype
protein was mainly present at the cell membrane. The mutation was not
found in 81 unrelated Pakistani RP patients or in 90 ethnically matched
control individuals.

185880	TITLE *185880 VESICLE-ASSOCIATED MEMBRANE PROTEIN 1; VAMP1
;;SYNAPTOBREVIN 1; SYB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Synaptobrevins 1 and 2 (185881) are small integral membrane proteins
specific for synaptic vesicles in neurons.

CLONING

Archer et al. (1990) isolated and characterized cosmid clones containing
the human genes encoding synaptobrevins 1 and 2. Their coding regions
are highly homologous, being interrupted at identical positions by
introns of different size and sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

The genes encoding synaptobrevins 1 and 2 have 5 exons whose boundaries
correspond to those of the protein domains (Archer et al., 1990). Exon 1
contains part of the initiator methionine codon, whereas exon 2 encodes
the variable and immunogenic amino-terminal domain. The third exon
comprises the highly conserved central domain, exon 4 encodes most of
the transmembrane region, and exon 5 contains the last residues of the
transmembrane region and the small intravesicular carboxyl terminus.

GENE FUNCTION

Neuronal exocytosis is triggered by calcium and requires 3 SNARE
proteins: synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicle, and syntaxin (e.g.,
186590) and SNAP25 (600322) on the plasma membrane. Neuronal SNARE
proteins form a parallel 4-helix bundle that is thought to drive the
fusion of opposing membranes. Hu et al. (2002) demonstrated that whereas
syntaxin and SNAP25 in target membranes are freely available for SNARE
complex formation, availability of synaptobrevin on synaptic vesicles is
very limited. Calcium at micromolar concentrations triggers SNARE
complex formation and fusion between synaptic vesicles and reconstituted
target membranes. Although calcium does promote interaction of SNARE
proteins between opposing membranes, it does not act by releasing
synaptobrevin from synaptic vesicle restriction. Hu et al. (2002)
concluded that their data suggests a mechanism in which
calcium-triggered membrane apposition enables syntaxin and SNAP25 to
engage synaptobrevin, leading to membrane fusion.

Tucker et al. (2004) investigated the effect of synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1;
185605) on membrane fusion mediated by neuronal SNARE proteins SNAP25,
syntaxin, and synaptobrevin, which were reconstituted into vesicles. In
the presence of calcium, the cytoplasmic domain of SYT1 strongly
stimulated membrane fusion when synaptobrevin densities were similar to
those found in native synaptic vesicles. The calcium dependence of
SYT1-stimulated fusion was modulated by changes in lipid composition of
the vesicles and by a truncation that mimics cleavage of SNAP25 by
botulinum neurotoxin A. Stimulation of fusion was abolished by
disrupting the calcium-binding activity, or by severing the tandem C2
domains, of SYT1. Thus, SYT1 and SNAREs are likely to represent the
minimal protein complement for calcium-triggered exocytosis.

By use of the large calyx of Held presynaptic terminal from rats, Sakaba
et al. (2005) demonstrated that cleavage of different SNARE proteins by
clostridial neurotoxins caused distinct kinetic changes in
neurotransmitter release. When elevating calcium ion concentration
directly at the presynaptic terminal with the use of caged calcium,
cleavage of SNAP25 by botulinum toxin A produced a strong reduction in
the calcium sensitivity for release, whereas cleavage of syntaxin using
botulinum toxin C1 and synaptobrevin using tetanus toxin produced an all
or nothing block without changing the kinetics of remaining vesicles.
When stimulating release by calcium influx through channels, a
difference between botulinum toxin C1 and tetanus toxin emerged, which
suggests that cleavage of synaptobrevin modifies the coupling between
channels and release-competent vesicles.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, Archer et al.
(1990) assigned the SYB1 gene to 12p; by analysis of DNA from Chinese
hamster-mouse somatic cell hybrids, they mapped the Syb1 gene to mouse
chromosome 6.

ANIMAL MODEL

The 'lethal-wasting' (lew) mouse is a spontaneous autosomal recessive
mutant that manifests as a neurologic phenotype characterized by
generalized lack of movement, wasting and prewean death by age 15 days.
By positional cloning, Nystuen et al. (2007) determined that the lew
phenotype results from a 190G-T transversion in the coding region of the
Vamp1 gene, predicted to result in truncation of nearly half of the
protein. Western blot analysis showed no detectable Vamp1 protein in
mutant mice. The authors noted that the phenotype was milder than that
of Vamp2 (185881)-null mice, which die at birth. By immunostudies of
normal mice, Nystuen et al. (2007) showed that Vamp1 is expressed
primarily in certain neuronal tissues, including the retina and areas of
the diencephalon and midbrain such as the zona incerta (subthalamus) and
rostral periolivary region. The findings suggested that Vamp1 has a
vital role in a subset of central nervous system tissues.

611088	TITLE *611088 COILED-COIL DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 65; CCDC65
;;NYD-SP28
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CCDC65 is a sperm tail protein that is posttranslationally modified
during sperm capacitation (Zheng et al., 2006).

CLONING

By differential display of genes upregulated in human adult versus fetal
testis, Zheng et al. (2006) cloned CCDC65, which they called NYD-SP28.
The deduced 484-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 57
kD and contains 2 potential sites for N-glycosylation, 2 for
N-myristoylation, and many potential phosphorylation sites. Western blot
analysis detected high CCDC65 expression in adult human testis, but no
detectable expression in fetal testis. Immunohistochemical studies of
CCDC65 expression in spermatozoa detected protein primarily in the
spermatocyte and spermatid, with weak expression in spermatogonia and no
signal in Leydig cells. Immunofluorescence analysis detected CCDC65
throughout the entire sperm tail in human noncapacitated, capacitated,
and acrosome-reacted spermatozoa. Using 2-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis
of proteins from human noncapacitated and capacitated sperm extracts,
Zheng et al. (2006) concluded that CCDC65 is posttranslationally
modified during capacitation. Transfection experiments in 7721 cells
localized CCDC65 to the cytoplasm.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zheng et al. (2006) determined that the CCDC65 gene contains 8 exons
spanning more than 17 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zheng et al. (2006) mapped the CCDC65 gene
to chromosome 12q13.12.

GENE FUNCTION

Austin-Tse et al. (2013) noted that the Chlamydomonas CCDC65 ortholog
Fap250 is a subunit of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC). The
Chlamydomonas ida6 motility mutant with inner arm dynein defects was
rescued by transformation with Fap250, and a causative mutation was
identified in the Fab250/Ccdc65 gene. Analysis of isolated ida6 axonemes
showed defects in the assembly of both the inner dynein arms and the
N-DRC. These data, together with the predicted size of the FAP250
polypeptide, strongly suggested that FAP250 corresponds to the DRC2
subunit of N-DRC and that DRC2/FAP250/CCDC65 plays a critical role in
the assembly of the N-DRC.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 Ashkenazi Jewish patients, including 2 brothers, with primary
ciliary dyskinesia-27 (CILD27; 615504), Austin-Tse et al. (2013)
identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the CCDC65 gene
(611088.0001). The patients were ascertained from a larger cohort of 295
individuals with CILD. The patients had recurrent bronchitis, sinusitis,
and/or otitis media, but no situs inversus. Fertility status could not
be ascertained. Cilia ultrastructure showed normal outer dynein arms,
radial spokes, and central pairs, but there was a reduction in inner
dynein arms and nexin links. Microtubule disorganization was also
observed in 5 to 15% of cilia cross sections, suggesting that the
reduction in nexin links may lead to overall structural instability in a
subset of cilia. Live imaging of patient nasal epithelial cilia showed a
stiff, dyskinetic cilia waveform.

ANIMAL MODEL

Austin-Tse et al. (2013) found that morpholino knockdown of the CCDC65
gene in zebrafish resulted in a strong ciliopathy phenotype, including
pronephric cysts, axis curvature, left-right asymmetry defects, and
hydrocephalus. Immunostaining for certain ciliary proteins did not
detect structural abnormalities, and ultrastructure analysis showed that
the outer dynein arms were not missing. High-speed video microscopy
showed stiff, dyskinetic cilia, consistent with a motility defect.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CILIARY DYSKINESIA, PRIMARY, 27, WITHOUT SITUS INVERSUS
CCDC65, 2-BP DEL, 877AT

In 2 brothers of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with primary ciliary
dyskinesia-27 without situs inversus (CILD27; 615504), Austin-Tse et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion (877delAT) in exon 6 of the
CCDC65 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination
(Ile293ProfsTer2). An unrelated girl of Ashkenazi Jewish descent was
also found to be homozygous for the mutation; her unaffected parents
were heterozygous for the mutation. The patients had recurrent
bronchitis, sinusitis, and/or otitis media. Fertility status could not
be ascertained. Cilia ultrastructure showed normal outer dynein arms,
radial spokes, and central pairs, but there was a reduction in inner
dynein arms and nexin links. Microtubule disorganization was also
observed in 5 to 15% of cilia cross sections, suggesting that the
reduction in nexin links may lead to overall structural instability in a
subset of cilia. Live imaging of patient nasal epithelial cilia showed a
stiff, dyskinetic cilia waveform.

609511	TITLE *609511 ZINC FINGER FYVE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 20; ZFYVE20
;;RABENOSYN 5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a gel overlay assay, Nielsen et al. (2000) identified ZFYVE20,
which they called rabenosyn-5, as a protein that directly interacts with
RAB5 (179512). By peptide analysis, EST database analysis, and PCR of a
HeLa cell cDNA library, they cloned rabenosyn-5 cDNA. The deduced
784-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal C2H2-type zinc finger
domain, a central FYVE finger domain, and 5 copies of the amino acid
motif NPF at its C terminus. SDS-PAGE showed rabenosyn-5 with an
apparent molecular mass of 110 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Nielsen et al. (2000) determined that rabenosyn-5 colocalized with EEA1
(605070) on RAB5-positive endosomes in HeLa cells. Recruitment of
rabenosyn-5 and EEA1 was dependent upon phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(see 601232). Mutation analysis indicated that the FYVE domain of
rabenosyn-5 was required for endosome targeting. Rabenosyn-5 was
complexed with the Sec1-like protein VPS45 (VPS45A; 610035), and
rabenosyn-5 appeared to serve as a molecular link between VPS45 and
RAB5. Both EEA1 and rabenosyn-5 were required for early endosomal
fusion, but only rabenosyn-5 overexpression inhibited processing of
procathepsin D (116840) to its 47-kD intermediate, suggesting that the 2
proteins play distinct roles in endosomal trafficking.

By immunofluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells, Naslavsky et al. (2004)
detected rabenosyn-5 partly colocalized with EHD1 (605888) in vesicular
and tubular structures. Depletion of either EHD1 or rabenosyn-5 in HeLa
cells by RNA interference (RNAi) delayed recycling of transferrin
(190000) and its receptor (TFRC; 190010), as well as major
histocompatibility complex class I (see HLA-A; 142800), to the plasma
membrane. Depletion of EHD1 caused accumulation of internalized cargo in
a compact juxtanuclear compartment, but depletion of rabenosyn-5 caused
retention of cargo within a dispersed peripheral compartment.
Simultaneous depletion of both rabenosyn-5 and EHD1 resulted in a
phenotype similar to that observed with rabenosyn-5 RNAi alone,
suggesting that rabenosyn-5 acts before EHD1 in the regulation of
endocytic recycling. Naslavsky et al. (2004) concluded that rabenosyn-5
and EHD1 act sequentially in the transport of proteins from early
endosomes to the endosomal recycling compartment and back to the plasma
membrane.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Using a structural proteomic approach, Eathiraj et al. (2005) determined
the specificity and structural basis underlying the interaction of the
multivalent effector rabenosyn-5 with the Rab family. The results
demonstrated that even the structurally similar effector domains in
rabenosyn-5 can achieve highly selective recognition of distinct subsets
of Rab GTPases exclusively through interactions with the switch and
interswitch regions. The observed specificity is determined at a
family-wide level by structural diversity in the active conformation,
which governs the spatial disposition of critical conserved recognition
determinants, and by a small number of both positive and negative
sequence determinants that allow further discrimination between Rab
GTPases with similar switch conformations.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ZFYVE20
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP STS-N59228).

612212	TITLE *612212 PLASMINOGEN-LIKE A; PLGLA
;;PLASMINOGEN-RELATED GENE A; PRGA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using primers based on PRGB (PLGLB1; 173340) for PCR amplification of
placental genomic DNA, Lewis et al. (1999) cloned PLGLA, which they
called PRGA. The deduced 96-amino peptide has a signal sequence followed
by a 77-amino acid stretch that is identical to the N terminus of
plasminogen (PLG; 173350) and differs from the homologous PRGB sequence
at only 4 positions. Northern blot analysis using a probe that did not
differentiate between PRGA and PRGB detected PRG only in liver and in a
lymphoblastic leukemia cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lewis et al. (1999) determined that the PLGLA gene contains 4 coding
exons.

Kida et al. (1997) characterized the 5-prime flanking region of the
human PLGLA gene and found 3 TATA boxes 550 to 600 bp upstream of the
transcription initiation site, a TATA-like sequence (TGTAA) at position
-16, and putative binding sites for several transcription factors. The
1.1-kb 5-prime flanking sequence directed basal liver-specific
expression in HepG2 cells, and deletion analysis identified 2 negative
elements in the PLGLA promoter.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PLGLA
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP D2S2643)

600641	TITLE *600641 SULFOTRANSFERASE FAMILY 1A, PHENOL-PREFERRING, MEMBER 3; SULT1A3
;;SULFOTRANSFERASE, MONOAMINE-PREFERRING; STM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sulfate conjugation is a key metabolic process controlled by a number of
genes. These include STD (125263), the dehydroepiandrosterone
(DHEA)-preferring sulfotransferase; STE (600043), the
estrogen-preferring form; STP1 (171150) and STP2 (601292), the
phenol-preferring forms; and STM, the monoamine-preferring form. STM,
the thermolabile or monoamine-metabolizing form of phenol
sulfotransferase, is responsible for the sulfate conjugation of
monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, over 95% of which is
sulfate conjugated (Aksoy and Weinshilboum, 1995).

CLONING

Zhu et al. (1993) and Wood et al. (1994) cloned the STM cDNA from brain
and liver libraries, respectively. The same cDNA was later isolated by
Jones et al. (1995). The 3 sequences were in agreement and predicted a
295-amino acid protein.

Aksoy et al. (1994) expressed the STM cDNA in COS-1 cells as a 35.5-kD
protein. Northern blots showed a 1.4-kb mRNA in liver, kidney, lung,
small intestine, spleen and leukocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Aksoy and Weinshilboum (1995) determined that the STM gene has a total
length of approximately 8.4 kb and includes 10 exons, the first 3 of
which are untranslated. Many of the exon-intron borders are at the same
positions as in the human DHEA sulfotransferase gene. The first 2 exons
are present in the 5-prime UTR of a longer mRNA expressed in brain and
liver, while exon 3 is present in the 5-prime UTR of a shorter mRNA also
present in these tissues.

Dooley and Huang (1996) determined the genomic organization of the human
STP1, STP2, and STM genes. These 3 genes each have 8 exons with the
initiator methionine on exon 2. All 3 colocalize on a single cosmid from
chromosome 16p12.1-p11.2 and have a high degree of sequence homology,
suggesting that these 3 genes arose by gene duplication. Dooley and
Huang (1996) stated that the previously identified PST gene sequences
HAST3 and M-PST are isolates of the STM gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Weinshilboum et al. (1997) reviewed the molecular biology of the
sulfotransferases. These enzymes catalyze sulfate conjugation of many
hormones, neurotransmitters, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds. They
stated that at that time the 5 known human cytosolic sulfotransferases
were STE (symbolized EST by them), a hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase
STD, and 3 phenol-preferring sulfotransferases (STP1, STP2, and STM).
The genes for these human enzymes, as well as those of other mammalian
cytosolic sulfotransferases that had been cloned, showed a high degree
of structural homology, with conservation of location of most
intron-exon splice junctions. Genetic polymorphisms of several of these
that have been demonstrated through family studies are suspected on the
basis of large differences among individuals in the expression.

MAPPING

Aksoy et al. (1994) used PCR screening of DNAs from human-rodent somatic
cell hybrid mapping panels to assign the STM gene to chromosome 16.
Regional localization to 16p11.2 was achieved by PCR analysis of a
high-resolution mouse-human somatic cell hybrid panel containing defined
portions of human chromosome 16.

Bernier et al. (1994) assigned the placental estrogen sulfotransferase
to chromosome 16 using DNA from panels of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids and PCR amplification. Weinshilboum (1995) pointed out that the
'placental estrogen sulfotransferase' gene that Bernier et al. (1994)
mapped to chromosome 16 is, in fact, the STM gene. Bernier et al. (1994)
reported, on the basis of expression data, that the mRNA encoded by
their gene can catalyze the sulfate conjugation of estrogens, although
with a much lower affinity than the mRNA encoded by the human STE gene
that is localized on 4q13.1 (600043).

The STM gene, a thermolabile phenol sulfotransferase, maps very near the
location of the thermostable phenol sulfotransferase, STP1. Her et al.
(1996) showed that a second thermolabile phenol sulfotransferase, STP2
(601292), also maps to chromosome 16.

607292	TITLE *607292 SEMAPHORIN 4A; SEMA4A
;;SEMAPHORIN B; SEMAB; SEMB
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SEMA4A is a member of the semaphorin family of soluble and transmembrane
proteins. Semaphorins are involved in guidance of axonal migration
during neuronal development and in immune responses.

CLONING

Using degenerate PCR primers based on motifs conserved in members of the
semaphorin family, Kumanogoh et al. (2002) identified mouse Sema4a,
which was originally identified as SemB (Puschel et al., 1995). RT-PCR
analysis detected prominent expression in adult mouse brain, spleen,
lung, kidney, and testis. Flow cytometric analysis showed expression in
B cells and dendritic cells (DCs) but not in resting T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Kumanogoh et al. (2002) showed that activation upregulated expression of
mouse Sema4a in both B and T cells, and proliferation and interleukin-2
(IL2; 147680) production by T cells were enhanced in the presence of
Sema4a. However, Sema4a, unlike CD100 (SEMA4D; 601866), did not enhance
the activation of B cells or DCs. Mice treated with Sema4a had enhanced
priming of antigen-specific T cells secreting both IL4 (147780) and
gamma-interferon (IFNG; 147570). Treatment of mice with anti-Sema4a
early after immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
suppressed the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
In these mice, infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells was
ablated by inhibition of the generation of antigen-specific T cells by
anti-Sema4a. Expression cloning determined that the high-affinity
receptor for Sema4a is Tim2. Sema4a stimulation of cells expressing Tim2
induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Tim2 but not of Tim3 (606652).
Kumanogoh et al. (2002) concluded that Sema4a and CD100 have crucial
roles in the reciprocal stimulation between T cell and
antigen-presenting cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Abid et al. (2006) screened 135 Pakistani patients with retinitis
pigmentosa (RP35; 610282), 25 with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD10; 610283),
and 30 with congenital blindness for mutations in the SEMA4A gene. They
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 substitutions
(607292.0001-607292.0002) in 2 RP and 2 CORD patients and heterozygosity
for another substitution (607292.0003) in 3 patients with RP and 1
patient with congenital blindness. No mutations in SEMA4A were found in
affected members of a Pakistani family with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD8;
605549) previously mapped to chromosome 1q12-q24 (Ismail et al., 2006).

In 2 Pakistani patients with retinitis pigmentosa-35 (610282) and 2 with
cone-rod dystrophy-10 (610282), Abid et al. (2006) identified compound
heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion in codon 345 and a T-to-G
transversion in codon 350 in exon 10 of the SEMA4A gene, resulting in an
asp345-to-his (D345H) and a phe350-to-cys (F350C; 607292.0002)
substitution in the conserved semaphorin domain, respectively. Sequence
analysis of the unaffected parents of 1 of the CORD patients revealed
that his father was heterozygous for the D345H mutation and his mother
was heterozygous for the F350C mutation. Neither mutation was found in
100 ethnically matched controls.

In 3 Pakistani patients with retinitis pigmentosa-35 (610282) and 1 with
congenital blindness of uncertain phenotype, Abid et al. (2006)
identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition in codon 713 of exon
15 of the SEMA4A gene, resulting in an arg713-to-gln (R713Q)
substitution in the cytoplasmic tail. Sequence analysis of family
members of 1 of the RP patients confirmed that the R713Q mutation
segregated with the disease phenotype in an autosomal dominant mode of
inheritance, and the mutation was not found in 100 ethnically matched
controls.

606238	TITLE *606238 IKAROS FAMILY ZINC FINGER 5; IKZF5
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN, SUBFAMILY 1A, MEMBER 5; ZNFN1A5;;
PEGASUS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the Ikaros (ZNFN1A1; 603023) family of transcription factors,
which includes Pegasus, are expressed in lymphocytes and are implicated
in the control of lymphoid development.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen on an erythroleukemia cDNA library with
the C-terminal dimerization domain of Aiolos (606221) as bait, followed
by RT-PCR, Perdomo et al. (2000) isolated cDNAs encoding Eos (606239)
and Pegasus. Sequence analysis predicted that the Pegasus protein
contains 419 amino acids. Like the other Ikaros family members, Pegasus
has a conserved C-terminal zinc finger cluster. However, Pegasus has
little homology in its other regions to Ikaros family proteins, and it
has 3 divergent N-terminal zinc fingers rather than the 4 N-terminal
fingers conserved in the other members. GST pull-down experiments showed
that the C-terminal zinc fingers of Pegasus interact with other Ikaros
proteins and with Pegasus itself, establishing the presence of
functional dimerization domains. DNA binding analysis indicated that
Eos, but not Pegasus, interacts with high affinity with sequences
similar to those bound by Ikaros and other family members. Pegasus was
found to preferentially recognize GnnTGTnG rather than the tGGGAatacc
site recognized by other Ikaros family members. Reporter analysis
demonstrated that Pegasus acts as a transcriptional repressor at its
sites but not at Eos sites. Northern blot analysis revealed broad
expression of 3 Pegasus transcripts in hemopoietic cell lines and in
tissues, a pattern that contrasts with the immune tissue-restricted
expression of other Ikaros family members.

;;MITOCHONDRIAL MALONYLTRANSFERASE;;
MT, MITOCHONDRIAL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MCAT (EC 2.3.1.39) is the catalytic subunit of the type II
malonyl-CoA-dependent system for biosynthesis of fatty acids in
mitochondria (Zhang et al., 2003).

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2003) cloned human MCAT, which they called mitochondrial
MT. The deduced 390-amino acid protein has an N-terminal cleavable
mitochondrial targeting signal, a GxSxG serine esterase active-site
motif, and conserved arg and his residues required for activity.
Fluorescence-tagged MCAT colocalized with a mitochondrial marker
following expression in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2003) found that human mitochondrial MT expressed in
insect cells had a narrower substrate specificity than cytosolic MT
(FASN; 600212) and transferred a malonyl moiety to the mitochondrial
malonyl acceptor ACP (NDUFAB1; 603836) only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2003) determined that the MCAT gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2003) mapped the MCAT gene
to chromosome 22q13.31.

611966	TITLE *611966 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 9; TRAPPC9
;;NIK- AND IKBKB-BINDING PROTEIN; NIBP;;
KIAA1882
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NIBP binds NIK (604655) and IKK-beta (IKBKB; 603258) and plays a role in
the neuronal NF-kappa-B (see 164011) signaling pathway (Hu et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from an adult amygdala cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (2001) cloned a partial cDNA encoding NIBP, which they
designated KIAA1882. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in all
tissues and specific brain regions examined.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library using
N-terminal NIK (MAP3K14; 604655) as bait, followed by database analysis,
Hu et al. (2005) cloned NIBP. The deduced 1,246-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 139.4 kD and shares 80 to 90% homology with
the corresponding rodent sequences. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 4.5-kb transcript with high expression in muscle and
kidney, and lower levels in brain, heart, and placenta; 2 smaller
transcripts of 2.1 and 1.5 kb were also detected. Immunohistochemical
studies detected NIBP protein in neuronal cells in mouse brain with
staining localized to cell bodies and neuronal processes in the
pyramidal layer of mouse cortex, spinal cord motor neurons, and white
matter neurons.

Mochida et al. (2009) noted that there are 2 transcript variants of
TRAPPC9 in humans. Variant 1 is the longer form and encodes a
1,246-amino acid protein. Variant 2 uses an alternate 5-prime exon
initiating translation at a downstream start codon and encodes a
1,148-amino acid protein. In situ hybridization showed low levels of
expression in mouse embryonic brain with strong expression in adult
brain. Trappc9 was found in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus,
and deep gray matter. Trappc9 immunoreactivity was widespread in the
cytoplasm, without specific localization to any particular organelle,
and was not found in the nucleus. In 11.5-week human embryonic brain,
there was higher expression in the developing cortical plate compared to
the ventricular zone, indicating higher expression in postmitotic
neurons than in progenitor cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hu et al. (2005) determined that the TRAPPC9 gene contains 23 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hu et al. (2005) mapped the TRAPPC9 gene
to chromosome 8q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, Hu et al. (2005)
showed that NIBP interacted with NIK and IKK-beta but showed no
interaction with IKK-alpha (CHUK; 600664) or IKK-gamma (IKBKG; 300248).
NIBP overexpression in HEK293T cells potentiated TNFA (191160)-induced
NF-kappa-B activation through increased phosphorylation of the IKK
complex and its downstream substrates IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008) and p65
(NFKB3; 164014). Mobility shift assays demonstrated increased NF-kappa-B
DNA binding. Knockdown of NIBP by siRNA reduced TNFA-induced NF-kappa-B
activation, prevented NGF (see 162030)-induced neuronal differentiation,
and decreased BCLXL (see BCL2L1; 600039) gene expression in PC12 cells.
Hu et al. (2005) suggested that NIBP may act as an adaptor to recruit
NIK or other kinases to the IKK complex, and that NIBP acts as a
downstream component of NGF in neuronal cells.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis, followed by candidate gene sequencing,
of an Israeli Arab family with nonsyndromic mental retardation (MRT13;
613192), Mochida et al. (2009) identified a homozygous truncating
mutation in the TRAPPC9 gene (R475X; 611966.0001).

Mir et al. (2009) identified the R475X mutation in affected members of a
Pakistani family with MRT13 and identified a 4-bp deletion (611966.0003)
in affected members of an Iranian family with MRT13, previously reported
by Najmabadi et al. (2007).

Philippe et al. (2009) identified a nonsense mutation in the TRAPPC9
gene (611966.0002) in 3 Tunisian brothers with autosomal recessive
mental retardation.

In 2 sisters, born of unrelated parents from southern Italy, with MRT13,
Marangi et al. (2013) identified a homozygous truncating mutation in the
TRAPPC9 gene (611966.0004).

In affected members of an Israeli Arab family with nonsyndromic
autosomal recessive mental retardation and postnatal microcephaly
(MRT13; 613192), Mochida et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1423C-T
transition in exon 7 of the TRAPPC9 gene, resulting in an arg475-to-ter
(R475X) substitution in TRAPPC9 variant 1. The same change represents
1129C-T, resulting in an arg377-to-ter (R377X) substitution, in TRAPPC9
variant 2. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the mutation, and
it was not identified in 306 control chromosomes. The protein was not
detected in patient lymphoblast cell lines.

Mir et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 1422C-T transition in the
TRAPPC9 gene, resulting in an R475X mutation, in affected members of a
large consanguineous Pakistani family with mental retardation. The
mutant protein was not expressed, consistent with nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay. Affected individuals had borderline microcephaly, delayed
walking, and white matter abnormalities on brain MRI.

Abou Jamra et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for the R475X mutation
in affected members of a large consanguineous Syrian family with
autosomal recessive mental retardation. The patients had neonatal
hypotonia, severe motor delay with walking between ages 5 and 7 years,
single words or no speech, growth retardation, stereotypic movements,
and hand flapping. They also shared some dysmorphic features, including
low frontal hairline, synophrys, and microcephaly.

In 3 brothers, born of consanguineous Tunisian parents, with autosomal

identified a homozygous 1708C-T transition in exon 9 of the TRAPPC9
gene, resulting in an arg570-to-ter (R570X) substitution. The mutation
was not found in 1,120 control chromosomes. The protein was not detected
in patient fibroblasts, and the authors postulated nonsense-mediated
mRNA decay. In cultured patient fibroblasts, stimulation with TNF-alpha
(191160) showed a defect in IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008) degradation,
suggesting impaired function of the NF-kappa-B (see 164011) signaling
pathway.

(2311delTGTT) in the TRAPPC9 gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination. Affected members had severe nonsyndromic mental

were no seizures or dysmorphic features.

transversion in intron 17 of the TRAPPC9 gene (2851-2A-C), resulting in
the skipping of exon 18, a frameshift, and premature termination
(Thr951TyrfsTer17). Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
mutation, which was identified by exome sequencing. PCR analysis of
patient cells did not show reduction of the TRAPPC9 transcript in the 2
sisters.

611596	TITLE *611596 SHORT-CHAIN DEHYDROGENASE/REDUCTASE FAMILY, MEMBER 4; DHRS4
;;SDR FAMILY, MEMBER 4;;
NADPH-DEPENDENT RETINOL DEHYDROGENASE/REDUCTASE; NRDR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes, like DHRS4, are
NAD/NADP-dependent oxidoreductases that function in the breakdown of
steroids, retinoids, prostaglandins, and xenobiotics. DHRS2 also has a
noncatalytic role in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis
(summary by Gabrielli and Tofanelli, 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of rat Dhrs4, Fransen et al. (1999)
identified 3 variants of human DHRS4, which they called SDR-SRL because
the protein belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR)
family and has a C-terminal SRL peroxisome-targeting sequence.
Fluorescence-tagged rat Dhrs4 localized to peroxisomes in transfected
Chinese hamster ovary cells.

By RT-PCR and RACE of a human liver cDNA library, Du et al. (2004)
cloned full-length DHRS4, which they called NRDR, and a shorter variant
lacking exons 4, 5, and 6. Both deduced proteins contain a classical
alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)-short domain, a short-chain ADH (SCAD)
motif, phosphorylation and fatty acylation sites, and a peroxisomal
targeting signal. RT-PCR detected variable expression of both
transcripts in most tissues examined.

By RT-PCR and RACE of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Song et al. (2007)
cloned full-length NRDR and a variant lacking exon 3, which they called
NRDRB1. The deduced NRDR and NRDRB1 proteins have calculated molecular
masses of 29 and 27 kD, respectively. Song et al. (2007) detected NRDRB1
mRNA expression in 14 (53.9%) of 26 cervical cancer tissues, but
expression was not detected in 12 normal cervical tissues.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected NRDRB1 protein only in tumor
tissues. The full-length NRDR mRNA was observed in both normal and
neoplastic cervical tissues, but NRDR protein was only expressed in
normal cervical epithelium, where it localized in peroxisomes.

Gabrielli and Tofanelli (2012) reported that the full-length DHRS4
protein contains 278 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Gabrielli and Tofanelli (2012) noted that differences in the
substrate-binding sites of DHRS2 (615194) and DHRS4 are associated with
different substrate specificities. In general, DHRS4 accepts a broader
range of substrates than DHRS2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Du et al. (2004) determined that the DHRS4 gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Du et al. (2004) mapped the DHRS4 gene to
chromosome 14q11.2.

EVOLUTION

Gabrielli and Tofanelli (2012) found that DHRS2 and DHRS4, which are
located within 315 kb of each other on chromosome 14, originated from a
duplication of the DHRS4 gene that took place before the formation of
the mammalian clade. DHRS2 evolved more rapidly and underwent positive
selection on more sites than the DHRS4 gene. DHRS2 sites under positive
selection were mainly located in the enzyme active site. Two other
duplicated DHRS4 genes, DHRS4L2 (615196) and DHRS4L1 (615195), are
located 20 and 47 kb downstream of DHRS4, respectively.

602120	TITLE *602120 CHROMODOMAIN HELICASE DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 3; CHD3
;;Mi2-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION See CHD1 (602118) for a description of this gene family.

CLONING

Anti-Mi2 autoantibody is strongly associated with dermatomyositis and is
found in sera of 20% of dermatomyositis patients. Mi2 antigen consists
of at least 8 components. By immunoscreening human thymocyte and HeLa
cell cDNA expression libraries with anti-Mi2 patient sera, Ge et al.
(1995) isolated a partial cDNA encoding Mi2-alpha, or CHD3. The deduced
partial protein contains 4 potential zinc finger domains. Antibodies
against recombinant Mi2-alpha reacted with a 240-kD HeLa cell protein.
Northern blot analysis detected a single 7.5- to 8.0-kb Mi2-alpha
transcript in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Seelig et al. (1996) noted that the Mi2-alpha and Mi2-beta (CHD4;
603277) proteins react with most or all dermatomyositis patient anti-Mi2
sera. While these proteins are distinct, they have stretches of
identical sequence that could result in shared epitopes.

Woodage et al. (1997) characterized the CHD3 gene. The predicted
1,944-amino acid protein shares 22.9% identity and 34.5% similarity
overall with the mouse Chd1 gene product.

MAPPING

Woodage et al. (1997) mapped the CHD3 gene to 17p13 by PCR screening of
the Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid mapping panel.

611430	TITLE *611430 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 21A; TTC21A
;;STRESS-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN 2; STI2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis to identify putative coding sequences in a region
of chromosome 3 associated with carcinomas, Protopopov et al. (2003)
identified TTC21A, which they called ST12. The deduced 1,320-amino acid
protein contains 10 N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats of about 34
amino acids each. Northern blot analysis detected strong expression of a
6.5-kb transcript only in testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Protopopov et al. (2003) determined that the TTC21A gene contains 27
exons and spans about 27 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH and a deletion cell hybrid panel, Protopopov et al. (2003)
mapped the TTC21A gene to chromosome 3p21.3.

607074	TITLE *607074 PROTEIN KINASE D2; PRKD2
;;PKD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the conserved C-terminal sequence of
serine kinases and screening of a human ductal pancreatic cDNA library,
Sturany et al. (2001) cloned a novel serine/threonine protein kinase,
which they called PKD2. The deduced 878-amino acid protein, which has a
predicted molecular mass of 97 kD, contains an N-terminal hydrophobic
area predicted to be a transmembrane region, 2 cysteine-rich motifs that
form zinc finger-like repeats, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a
putative kinase domain containing the ATP-binding consensus sequence. An
invariant aspartate essential for kinase activity is located within a
motif conserved in serine/threonine kinases. The first zinc finger-like
domain shares 88% identity to the corresponding domains in PKD/PKC-mu
(PRKCM; 605435) and PKC-nu (PRKCN; 607077). Northern blot analysis
detected constitutive low expression of a 4-kb transcript; higher levels
were observed in pancreas, heart, lung, smooth muscle, and brain, and
lower levels kidney and liver. SDS-PAGE revealed a protein with a
molecular mass of 105 kD, as did Western blot analysis of endogenous
PRKD2 or protein expressed following transfection.

GENE FUNCTION

Sturany et al. (2001) demonstrated phorbol ester binding to the duplex
zinc finger-like motif of PRKD2 as well as autophosphorylation following
phorbol ester stimulation. The addition of phosphatidyl-L-serine caused
synergistic stimulation. Phorbol ester-activated PRKD2 migrated more
slowly than inactive PRKD2 by SDS-PAGE, suggesting hyperphosphorylation
upon activation.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PRKD2
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP R67403).

;;EIF3-p110;;
EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 3, SUBUNIT 8, FORMERLY; EIF3S8,
FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic initiation factor-3 (eIF3) is the largest of the eIFs and
consists of at least 10 nonidentical subunits, including EIF2C (Asano et
al., 1997).

CLONING

Asano et al. (1997) demonstrated that the 115-kD component of HeLa cell
eIF3 is actually composed of 2 proteins, p116 (PRT1; 603917) and p110.
By screening a HeLa cell expression library with antibodies against the
115-kD band, these authors identified cDNAs encoding p110. The predicted
913-amino acid p110 protein has a pI of 5.8 and is unrelated to p116.
p110 shares 31% identity to the S. cerevisiae Nip1 protein, which is
thought to be involved in nuclear import and the initiation phase of
protein synthesis. Asano et al. (1997) found that the p116, p110, and
p36 (603911) subunits localize on 40S ribosomes in cells active in
translation and coimmunoprecipitate with p170 (602039), indicating that
these proteins are integral components of eIF3. Northern blot analysis
revealed that p110 is expressed as a 3-kb mRNA.

GENE FUNCTION

By reciprocal yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses of the
human STS26T malignant schwannoma cell line, Scoles et al. (2006) showed
that isoforms 1 and 2 of schwannomin (NF2; 607379) interacted with
EIF3C. Mutation analysis revealed that the FERM domain of schwannomin
interacted with the C-terminal half of EIF3C. Immunofluorescence
microscopy of STS26T cells showed that the 2 proteins partly colocalized
at punctate perinuclear structures and at some membranous structures.
Overexpression of EIF3C in STS26T cells elevated cell proliferation, and
schwannomin countered this effect. Western blot analysis revealed an
inverse abundance of schwannomin and EIF3C in human meningiomas.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the EIF3C gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the EIF3C sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC000533) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37). A nearly identical copy of EIF3C, designated
EIF3CL, also maps to chromosome 16p11.2.

608487	TITLE *608487 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 5; TRIM5
;;RNF88
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIM5 belongs to the large tripartite motif protein family, members of
which typically are composed of 3 zinc-binding domains, a RING, unique
B-box type 1 and B-box type 2 domains, followed by a coiled-coil (CC)
region. TRIM proteins use homomultimerization to identify specific cell
compartments.

CLONING

Using a consensus B-box domain to screen dbEST databases, Reymond et al.
(2001) identified 37 TRIM members in mammals, 21 of which were novel, as
well as 34 splice variants. TRIM5 has 6 variants termed alpha, beta,
gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta, all of which lack a B-box type 1
domain. Additional domains C-terminal to the CC region are variably
present. TRIM5-zeta lacks RING, B-box, and CC domains, but possesses 3
RFP-like domains. Northern blot analysis of adult human tissues detected
ubiquitous expression of TRIM5. Using interaction mating and mutation
analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) confirmed that TRIM5, like most TRIMs,
homointeracts through the CC region. Interaction was also detected with
TRIM6 (607564). Green fluorescent protein microscopy demonstrated
expression as cytoplasmic speckles, possibly in novel subcellular
compartments.

Stremlau et al. (2004) determined that human TRIM5-alpha contains 493
amino acids and includes a C-terminal b30.2 (SPRY) domain missing in
other TRIM5 isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

By fluorescence microscopy and mutation analysis, Xu et al. (2003)
showed that TRIM5-delta interacts with BTBD1 (608530) and BTBD2
(608531), apparently serving as a scaffold for the assembly of
endogenous BTBD1/2 proteins, dependent on the presence of the CC region
and a wildtype RING domain. TRIM5-delta exhibits ubiquitylation in the
presence of UBCH5B (UBE2D2; 602962), dependent on the presence of
zinc-coordinating cysteines in the RING domain.

Kaiser et al. (2007) reported the reconstruction of the core protein of
a 4-million-year-old endogenous virus from the chimpanzee genome
(PtERV1) and showed that the human variant of the intrinsic immune
protein TRIM5-alpha can actively prevent infection by this virus.
However, Kaiser et al. (2007) suggested that the selective changes that
have occurred in the human lineage during the acquisition of resistance
to this virus, and perhaps similar viruses, may have left our species
more susceptible to infection by HIV-1.

Pertel et al. (2011) demonstrated that TRIM5 promotes innate immune
signaling and that this activity is amplified by retroviral infection
and interaction with the capsid lattice. Acting with the heterodimeric
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A, TRIM5 catalyzes the synthesis
of unattached K63-linked ubiquitin chains that activate the TAK1
(602614) kinase complex and stimulate AP1 (see 165160) and NF-kappa-B
(see 164011) signaling. Interaction with the HIV-1 capsid lattice
greatly enhanced the UBC13-UEV1A-dependent E3 activity of TRIM5, and
challenge with retroviruses induced the transcription of AP1- and
NF-kappa-B-dependent factors with a magnitude that tracked with TRIM5
avidity for the invading capsid. Finally, TAK1 and UBC13-UEV1A
contributed to capsid-specific restriction by TRIM5. Pertel et al.
(2011) concluded that the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5 has 2
additional activities that are linked to restriction: it constitutively
promotes innate immune signaling, and it acts as a pattern recognition
receptor specific for the retrovirus capsid lattice.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM5
gene to chromosome 11p15, in a cluster with TRIM6, TRIM21 (109092),
TRIM22 (606559), TRIM34 (605684), and a TRIM pseudogene. The authors
noted that, apart from another cluster in the HLA region (chromosome
6p21-23), TRIM genes are dispersed throughout the genome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Stremlau et al. (2004) noted that HIV-1, the cause of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans, efficiently enters the cells
of Old World monkeys but encounters a block before reverse
transcription. The block acts on the HIV-1 capsid and is mediated by a
dominant repressive factor. By screening HeLa cell lines transduced with
a cDNA library from rhesus fibroblasts, Stremlau et al. (2004)
identified HeLa cells expressing rhesus TRIM5-alpha. These cells were
resistant to HIV-1 but not simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)
infection. PCR analysis indicated a disruption of viral cDNA synthesis
in rhesus TRIM5-alpha-expressing cells. Mutation analysis suggested that
both the N-terminal RING and C-terminal SPRY domains of rhesus
TRIM5-alpha contribute to its HIV-1 inhibitory activity. Short
interfering (si) RNA experiments reducing rhesus TRIM5-alpha expression
resulted in increased efficiency of HIV-1 infection. Stremlau et al.
(2004) concluded that monkey TRIM5-alpha is the repressive factor
inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcription and proposed that rhesus
TRIM5-alpha may directly bind and ubiquitinate the HIV-1 viral capsid.

Sayah et al. (2004) showed that knockdown of owl monkey CYPA (123840) by
RNA interference (RNAi) correlated with suppression of anti-HIV-1
activity. However, reintroduction of CYPA to RNAi-treated cells did not
restore antiviral activity. A search for additional RNAi targets
identified TRIMCYP, an RNAi-responsive mRNA encoding a TRIM5/CYPA fusion
protein. TRIMCYP accounts for post-entry restriction of HIV-1 in owl
monkeys and blocks HIV-1 infection when transferred to otherwise
infectable human or rat cells. Sayah et al. (2004) suggested that
TRIMCYP arose after the divergence of New and Old World primates when a
LINE-1 retrotransposon catalyzed the insertion of a CYPA cDNA into the
TRIM5 locus. They concluded that this was the first vertebrate example
of a chimeric gene generated by this mechanism of exon shuffling.

Sakuma et al. (2007) showed that rhesus Trim5-alpha, but not human
TRIM5-alpha, blocked late-phase HIV-1 production through rapid
degradation of HIV-1 Gag polyproteins. In agreement with Sakuma et al.
(2007), Zhang et al. (2008) found that rhesus Trim5-alpha could block
late-stage HIV-1, but not macaque SIV, production. However, the amount
of Trim5-alpha required for this effect was much higher than that
endogenously expressed, and they questioned the biologic significance of
the finding. In a reply, Sakuma et al. (2008) suggested that technical
differences, such as cell lines and capsid sequences, may explain the
need for high Trim5-alpha expression in the experiments of Zhang et al.
(2008).

ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 4; AF4
DESCRIPTION The ALL1 gene (MLL; 159555), located at 11q23, is rearranged in acute
leukemias with reciprocal translocations between this region and
chromosomes 1, 4, 6 (159559), 9 (159558), 10, or 19 (159556). Gu et al.
(1992) studied the t(4;11) translocation which results in 2 reciprocal
fusion products coding for chimeric proteins derived from ALL1 and from
a gene on chromosome 4. They referred to the latter as AF4 for
'ALL1-fused gene from chromosome 4.' Fused RNAs were found in the three
t(4;11) cells lines studied; therefore, Gu et al. (1992) could not
establish which of the 2 products is oncogenic.

Nakamura et al. (1993) found that the gene on chromosome 4q21 that is
fused with the ALL1 gene in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
and translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23) and the gene on chromosome 9 that is
fused with the ALL1 gene on chromosome 11 in patients with leukemia and
the t(9;11)(p22;q23) show high sequence homology with the ENL gene on
chromosome 19, which is fused to the ALL1 gene in patients with leukemia
and the translocation t(11;19)(q23;p13). They found further that the
protein products of the AF4, AF9 (MLLT3), and ENL (MLLT1) genes
contained nuclear targeting sequences as well as serine-rich and
proline-rich regions. Stretches abundant in basic amino acids were also
present in the 3 proteins. These results indicated that the different
proteins fused to ALL1 polypeptides in leukemia provide similar
functional domains.

Domer et al. (1993) independently demonstrated that the derivative
chromosome 11, carrying a translocated segment of chromosome 4, encodes
a fusion RNA which predicts a chimeric protein with features of the MLL
gene on 11q23 and the AF4 gene on 4q21. The sequence of the complete
open reading frame for this fusion transcript revealed that the MLL
protein is homologous with DNA methyltransferase, the Drosophila
trithorax gene product, and the 'AT-hook' motif of high mobility group
proteins. An alternative splice that deletes the AT-hook region of MLL
was identified. AF4 is a serine- and proline-rich putative transcription
factor with a glutamine-rich carboxyl terminus. The composition of the
complete MLL-AF4 fusion product argues that it may act through either a
gain-of-function or a dominant-negative mechanism in leukemogenesis.
This gene is also symbolized MLLT2.

Uckun et al. (1998) analyzed bone marrow leukemic cells of 17 infants
and 127 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), as
well as fetal liver and bone marrow and normal infant bone marrow
samples for the presence of a t(4;11) translocation, using standard
cytogenetic techniques and expression of an MLL-AF4 fusion transcript by
standard RT-PCR assays as well as nested RT-PCR that is 100-fold more
sensitive than the standard RT-PCR. Overall, 9 of the 17 infants and 17
of 127 noninfant pediatric ALL patients were positive for expression of
MLL-AF4 fusion transcripts. None of the MLL-AF4(+) cases were positive
for E2A-PBX1 (147141; 176310) or BCR-ABL (151410; 189980) fusion
transcript expression. Although 8 of 9 MLL-AF4(+) infants had
cytogenetically detectable t(4;11) translocation, 15 of the 17
MLL-AF4(+) noninfants were t(4;11) negative. Infants with MLL-AF4(+) ALL
had poor outcomes, whereas noninfant fusion-gene-positive,
translocation-negative patients has favorable outcomes similar to
MLL-AF4(-) patients. Notably, MLL-AF4 transcripts also were detected by
nested RT-PCR in 4 of 16 fetal bone marrows, 5 of 13 fetal livers, and 1
of 6 normal infant bone marrows, but not in any of the 44 remission bone
marrow specimens from pediatric ALL patients. These results represented
unprecedented evidence that MLL-AF4 fusion transcripts can be present in
normal hematopoietic cells, indicating that their expression is
insufficient for leukemic transformation of normal lymphocyte
precursors.

Isnard et al. (1998) isolated cDNA clones of the mouse Af4 gene. By
Northern analysis, they detected a single transcript of approximately 10
kb in all adult tissues examined, with highest expression in thymus,
lymph nodes, and kidney. They also studied expression in fetal thymus
and liver. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, they showed that the
Af4 gene maps to the E region of mouse chromosome 5, which is syntenic
with human 4q21.

To gain insight into the translocation mechanism and the relevant drug
exposure in treatment-related leukemia, Lovett et al. (2001) analyzed
the der(11) and der(4) genomic breakpoint junctions of a t(4;11)
translocation in the leukemia of a patient previously administered
etoposide and dactinomycin for the chemotherapy of primary alveolar
rhabdomyosarcoma (268220). The genomic breakpoint junctions involved
intron 6 of the MLL gene and intron 3 of the AF4 gene. Recombination was
precise at the sequence level except for the overall gain of a single
templated nucleotide. The translocation breakpoints in MLL and AF4 were
DNA topoisomerase II cleavage sites. Etoposide and its metabolites, but
not dactinomycin, enhanced cleavage at these sites on in vitro
incubation. The findings were inconsistent with a translocation
mechanism involving interchromosomal recombination by simple exchange of
DNA topoisomerase II subunits and DNA-strand transfer. Etoposide and/or
its metabolites were considered the relevant exposures in this patient.

HP1, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, BETA;;
HP1-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) is localized at heterochromatin sites,
where it mediates gene silencing.

CLONING

Some autoimmune sera recognize antigens located near the centromere
(CENPA, 117139; CENPB, 117140; CENPC1, 117141) as well as
heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1). Using human autoimmune serum to screen
a HepG2 library, Furuta et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding CBX1, a
human homolog of Drosophila HP1, which the authors called HP1-beta. CBX1
encodes a 185-amino acid protein that has 66% sequence identity and 80%
similarity to CBX5 (604478). CBX1 is 100% identical to mouse M31 and to
human HSM1, which was identified by Singh et al. (1991). CBX1 has a
conserved 37-amino acid region called the chromodomain, or chromobox, in
the N-terminal region. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that only
antibodies directed against the C terminus of CBX1 showed nucleoplasmic
and heterochromatin staining. N-terminal-specific antibodies were
nonreactive. The C-terminal domain antibodies were also reactive with
the centromeric region during metaphase and anaphase and with whole
chromosomes during telophase.

GENE FUNCTION

Lachner et al. (2001) showed that mammalian methyltransferases that
selectively methylate histone H3 (see 602810) on lysine-9 (Suv39h
HMTases; see SUV39H1, 300254) generate a binding site for HP1 proteins,
a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene
silencing and supranucleosomal chromatin structure. High-affinity in
vitro recognition of a methylated histone H3 peptide by HP1 requires a
functional chromodomain; thus, the HP1 chromodomain is a specific
interaction motif for the methyl epitope on lysine-9 of histone H3. In
vivo, heterochromatin association of HP1 proteins is lost in Suv39h
double-null primary mouse fibroblasts but is restored after
reintroduction of a catalytically active SUV39H1 HMTase. Lachner et al.
(2001) concluded that their data define a molecular mechanism through
which the SUV39H-HP1 methylation system can contribute to the
propagation of heterochromatic subdomains in native chromatin.

Bannister et al. (2001) demonstrated that HP1 can bind with high
affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine-9 but not at lysine-4. They
identified the chromodomain of HP1 as its methyl-lysine-binding domain.
A point mutation in the chromodomain, which destroys the gene silencing
activity of HP1 in Drosophila, abolished methyl-lysine-binding activity.
Genetic and biochemical analysis in S. pombe showed that the methylase
activity of Clr4 (the SUV39H1 homolog) is necessary for the correct
localization of Swi6 (the HP1 equivalent) at centromeric heterochromatin
and for gene silencing. Bannister et al. (2001) concluded that these
results provide a stepwise model for the formation of a
transcriptionally silent heterochromatin: SUV39H1 places a methyl marker
on histone H3, which is then recognized by HP1 through its chromodomain.
This model may also explain the stable inheritance of the
heterochromatic state.

Eukaryotic genomes are organized into discrete structural and functional
chromatin domains. Noma et al. (2001) demonstrated that distinct
site-specific histone H3 methylation patterns define euchromatic and
heterochromatic chromosomal domains within an 47-kb region of the mating
type locus in fission yeast. H3 methylated at lysine-9, and its
interacting Swi6 protein, are strictly localized to a 20-kb silent
heterochromatic interval. In contrast, H3 methylated at lysine-4 is
specific to the surrounding euchromatic regions. Two inverted repeats
flanking the silent interval serve as boundary elements to mark the
borders between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Deletions of these
boundary elements leads to spreading of H3 lys9 methylation and Swi6
into neighboring sequences. Furthermore, the H3 lys6 methylation and
corresponding heterochromatin-associated complexes prevent H3 lys4
methylation in the silent domain.

Festenstein et al. (2003) used fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching to demonstrate that a GFP-HP1-beta fusion protein is
highly mobile within both the euchromatin and heterochromatin of ex vivo
resting murine T cells. Moreover, T cell activation greatly increased
this mobility, indicating that such a process may facilitate
(hetero)chromatin remodeling and permit access of epigenetic modifiers
and transcription factors to the many genes that are consequently
derepressed.

Cheutin et al. (2003) demonstrated that maintenance of stable
heterochromatin domains in living cells involves the transient binding
and dynamic exchange of HP1 from chromatin. HP1 exchange kinetics
correlated with the condensation level of chromatin and were dependent
on the histone methyltransferase Suv39h (300254). The chromodomain and
the chromoshadow domain of HP1 are both required for binding to native
chromatin in vivo, but they contribute differentially to binding in
euchromatin and heterochromatin. Cheutin et al. (2003) suggested that
their data argue against HP1 repression of transcription by formation of
static, higher order oligomeric networks but support a dynamic
competition model, and demonstrate that heterochromatin is accessible to
regulatory factors.

Fischle et al. (2005) demonstrated that HP1-alpha (604478), HP1-beta,
and HP1-gamma (604477) are released from chromatin during the M phase of
the cell cycle even though trimethylation levels of histone H3 lys9
remain unchanged. However, the additional transient modification of
histone H3 by phosphorylation of ser10 next to the more stable
methyl-lys9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their binding
sites. Inhibition or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B (604970),
which phosphorylates histone H3 on ser10, causes retention of HP1
proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that H3 ser10
phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from chromatin
in M phase. Fischle et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
establish a regulatory mechanism of protein-protein interactions,
through a combinatorial readout of 2 adjacent posttranslational
modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic phosphorylation mark.

Smallwood et al. (2007) demonstrated that DNMT1 (126375) could interact
with HP1-alpha, HP1-beta, and HP1-gamma in a human colon carcinoma cell
line, resulting in stimulation of DNMT1 methyltransferase activity. The
HP1 proteins were sufficient to target DNMT1 activity in vivo, and
HP1-dependent repression required DNMT1. Smallwood et al. (2007)
demonstrated that HP1-alpha and HP1-beta were recruited to the survivin
(BIRC5; 603352) promoter in a DNMT1-dependent manner. They concluded
that direct interactions between HP1 proteins and DNMT1 mediate
silencing of euchromatic genes.

Ayoub et al. (2008) identified a dynamic change in chromatin that
promotes H2AX (601772) phosphorylation in mammalian cells. DNA breaks
swiftly mobilized HP1-beta, a chromatin factor bound to histone H3
methylated on lysine-9 (H3K9me; see 601128). Local changes in histone
tail modifications were not apparent. Instead, phosphorylation of
HP1-beta on amino acid thr51 accompanied mobilization, releasing
HP1-beta from chromatin by disrupting hydrogen bonds that fold its
chromodomain around H3K9me. Inhibition of casein kinase-2 (CK2; see
115442), an enzyme implicated in DNA damage sensing and repair,
suppressed thr51 phosphorylation and HP1-beta mobilization in living
cells. CK2 inhibition, or a constitutively chromatin-bound HP1-beta
mutant, diminished H2AX phosphorylation. Ayoub et al. (2008) concluded
that their findings revealed a signaling cascade that helps to initiate
the DNA damage response, altering chromatin by modifying a histone code
mediator protein, HP1, but not the code itself.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nielsen et al. (2002) showed that HP1 uses an induced-fit mechanism to
recognize the methylation of lys9, as revealed by the structure of its
chromodomain bound to a histone H3 peptide dimethylated at N-zeta of
lys9. The binding pocket for the N-methyl groups is provided by 3
aromatic side chains, tyr21, trp42, and phe45, which reside in 2 regions
that become ordered on binding of the peptide. The side chain of lys9 is
almost fully extended and surrounded by residues that are conserved in
many other chromodomains. The QTAR peptide sequence preceding lys9
performs most of the additional interactions with the chromodomain, with
HP1 residues val23, leu40, trp42, leu58, and cys60 appearing to be a
major determinant of specificity by binding the key buried ala7. Nielsen
et al. (2002) concluded that their findings predict which other
chromodomains will bind methylated proteins and suggest a motif that
they might recognize.

179490	TITLE *179490 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB3A; RAB3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The RAS gene superfamily is divided into 3 main branches according to
protein homology. In mammals the first branch includes the classic RAS
genes as well as RAL (179550) and RRAS (165090). The RHO genes (165370,
165380, 165390) belong to the second branch and the RAB genes to the
third. The RAB genes were so named because they were first isolated from
a rat brain library. Zahraoui et al. (1989) isolated cDNAs encoding
RAB3A and several other human RAB proteins. See RAB5A (179512). The
predicted 220-amino acid human RAB3A protein shares 99% and 78% identity
with rat Rab3A and human RAB3B (179510), respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Giovedi et al. (2004) found that interaction between mammalian synapsin
I (SYN1; 313440) and Rab3a regulated the activities of both proteins.
Synapsin I stimulated the Rab3a cycle by increasing GTP binding, GTPase
activity, and Rab3a recruitment to the synaptic vesicle membrane.
Conversely, Rab3a inhibited synapsin I binding to actin and synapsin
I-induced synaptic vesicle clustering.

Corticoamygdala long-term potentiation (LTP) and late-phase LTP at
hippocampal synapses are 2 forms of LTP that require both postsynaptic
NMDA receptor (see, e.g., 138249) activation and presynaptic protein
kinase A (PKA; see 176911) activation. By in vitro analysis of
transverse slices from the hippocampus and lateral amygdala of
Rab3a-null mice, Huang et al. (2005) found that Rab3a was necessary for
both forms of synaptic plasticity. Rim1-alpha (606629), a
Rab3a-interacting molecule, was also required for hippocampal late-phase
LTP. The findings indicated that presynaptic proteins also play a role
in plasticity that is dependent on postsynaptic activity, thus adding a
layer of complexity to synaptic interactions.

Ruediger et al. (2011) investigated how mossy fiber terminal complexes
at the entry of hippocampal and cerebellar circuits rearrange upon
learning in mice, and the functional role of the rearrangements.
Ruediger et al. (2011) showed that one-trial and incremental learning
lead to robust, circuit-specific, long-lasting, and reversible increases
in the numbers of filopodial synapses onto fast-spiking interneurons
that trigger feedforward inhibition. The increase in feedforward
inhibition connectivity involved a majority of the presynaptic
terminals, restricted the number of c-Fos (164810)-expressing
postsynaptic neurons at memory retrieval, and correlated temporally with
the quality of the memory. Ruediger et al. (2011) then showed that for
contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze learning, increased
feedforward inhibition connectivity by hippocampal mossy fibers has a
critical role for the precision of the memory and the learned behavior.
In the absence of mossy fiber long-term potentiation in Rab3a-null mice,
c-Fos ensemble reorganization and feedforward inhibition growth were
both absent in CA3 upon learning, and the memory was imprecise. By
contrast, in the absence of adducin-2 (ADD2; 102681), c-Fos
reorganization was normal, but feedforward inhibition growth was
abolished. In parallel, c-Fos ensembles in CA3 were greatly enlarged,
and the memory was imprecise. Feedforward inhibition growth and memory
precision were both rescued by re-expression of Add2 specifically in
hippocampal mossy fibers. Ruediger et al. (2011) concluded that their
results established a causal relationship between learning-related
increases in the numbers of defined synapses and the precision of
learning and memory in the adult. The results further related plasticity
and feedforward inhibition growth at hippocampal mossy fibers to the
precision of hippocampus-dependent memories.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sullivan et al. (1999) found that the RAB3A gene consists of 5 exons
spanning 7.9 kb, and is located 3.7 kb from PDE4C (600128).

MAPPING

Rousseau-Merck et al. (1989, 1989) used the cloned human RAB3A cDNA as a
probe to map the corresponding gene by hybridization to flow sorted
chromosomes and by in situ hybridization. They concluded that RAB3A is
located on 19p13.2. The RAB genes may serve a regulatory function in the
developing nervous system. No oncogenic activity has been demonstrated
as yet for any of the RAB branch family genes. It is noteworthy,
however, that the 19p13.2 site is involved in malignant processes such
as acute leukemias. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Trask et al.
(1993) assigned the RAB3A gene to 19p13.1-p12.

ANIMAL MODEL

In brain, RAB3A is found specifically in synaptic vesicles. Geppert et
al. (1997) generated Rab3a-deficient mice. They found that the size of
the readily releasable pool of vesicles was normal, but that
calcium-triggered fusion was altered in the absence of Rab3a such that a
greater number of exocytic events occurred within a brief time after
arrival of the nerve impulse. They concluded that RAB3A regulates a late
step in synaptic vesicle fusion.

Kapfhamer et al. (2002) identified a semidominant mouse mutation called
'earlybird' (Ebd) that shortens the circadian period of locomotor
activity. Sequence analysis of Rab3a identified a point mutation in the
conserved amino acid (asp77 to gly) within the GTP-binding domain of the
Rab3a protein in earlybird mutants, resulting in significantly reduced
levels of Rab3a protein. Phenotypic assessment of earlybird mice and a
null allele of Rab3a revealed anomalies in circadian period and sleep
homeostasis, providing evidence that Rab3a-mediated synaptic
transmission is involved in these behaviors.

610626	TITLE *610626 PPAP2 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1B; PPAPDC1B
;;HTPAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Previous studies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggested that
deletion of a region of human chromosome 8p contributes to HCC
metastasis. Using cDNA microarray analysis of chromosome 8 ESTs from HCC
cell lines to identify genes with downregulated expression in high
metastatic potential versus low metastatic potential cell lines,
followed by database analysis and RT-PCR, Wu et al. (2006) cloned
PPAPDC1B, which they called HTPAP. The 175-amino acid protein contains
an N-terminal transmembrane domain, an acid phosphatase homology region,
2 PKC phosphorylation sites, and a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site.
RT-PCR analysis of 16 metastatic HCC tissues paired with 16 primary HCC
tissues showed downregulation of PPAPDC1B expression in 11 of 16
metastatic lesions compared to primary HCC tissues, with 9 of 16
metastatic lesions showing significant downregulation of PPAPDC1B (P
less than 0.05).

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro matrigel assays, Wu et al. (2006) showed that
PPAPDC1B-transfected metastatic HCC cells showed significantly lower
invasion activity. Transfection and expression of PPAPDC1B in nude mice
bearing human HCC significantly decreased the incidence and degree of
pulmonary metastasis of HCC.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Wu et al. (2006) mapped the PPAPDC1B gene
to chromosome 8p12.

609590	TITLE *609590 QUAKING, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; QKI
;;QK1;;
QK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

QKI belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins that have an HNRNPK
(600712) homology (KH) domain embedded in a 200-amino acid region called
the GSG domain. Other members of this family include SAM68 (KHDRBS1;
602489) and SF1 (601516) (Chen and Richard, 1998). QKI proteins regulate
RNA splicing, export of target RNAs from the nucleus, translation of
proteins, and RNA stability (Lauriat et al., 2008).

CLONING

Ebersole et al. (1996) identified several splice variants of mouse Qki
that could be grouped into 2 classes based on size. The longer mRNAs (7,
6, and 5 kb) were abundant in mouse brain, whereas the shorter mRNAs
(1.5 to 1.9 kb) were less abundant. The longer variants encode deduced
proteins containing an N-terminal proline-rich domain, followed by 2 RG
boxes, a second proline-rich region, a central GSG/STAR domain, a third
proline-rich domain, and 5 tyrosines preceding alternative C-terminal
ends. The GSG domain consists of a KH domain flanked by evolutionarily
conserved quaking (QUA) domains 1 and 2. Qki also has 7 SH3-binding
sites dispersed throughout its sequence. Qki expression peaked in
16-day-old myelinating mouse brain. A splice variant was also detected
in newborn testis. In situ hybridization of normal mouse brain showed
Qki transcripts in myelinating tracts in the cerebellum. Ebersole et al.
(1996) identified multiple QKI transcripts in human, rodent, chicken,
and frog.

By Northern blot analysis, Hardy et al. (1996) found that the 5-, 6-,
and 7-kb Qki mRNAs, which they designated Qki-5, Qki-6, and Qki-7,
respectively, were variably expressed in developing and adult mouse
brain. Levels of Qki-5 declined dramatically after the second postnatal
week, whereas levels of Qki-6 and Qki-7 declined modestly thereafter.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected all 3 proteins in myelinating
cells of the central and peripheral nervous system and in astrocytes.
The isoforms showed distinct intracellular distributions, however, with
Qki-6 and Qki-7 localized to perikaryal cytoplasm and Qki-5 restricted
to nucleus.

Noveroske et al. (2002) found that Qki was expressed in the yolk sac
endoderm in mice, adjacent to developing blood islands.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) found that QKI-5 showed
no significant differences in expression across various age groups in
human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. However, QKI-5 was the
only QKI variant expressed at high levels in fetal PFC. QKI-6 expression
increased in PFC in a linear fashion with age, with a substantial
increase between 1 to 2 months and 1 to 2 years of age. In human
hippocampus, QKI-6 expression increased at 1 to 2 years of age, remained
high during childhood, and decreased in adulthood. QKI-7a generally
showed a linear trend toward increased expression in PFC with age, but
there was a peak at 1 to 2 years of age. QKI-7b expression in PFC did
not vary significantly with age due to greater variability between
individuals, but there was a trend toward an increase with age. In
hippocampus, QKI-7a and QKI-7b showed a trend toward decreased
expression in adulthood, similar to QKI-6, but there was greater
variability between individuals. Lauriat et al. (2008) noted that
expression of QKI-6 and QKI-7 in PFC increased during the period of
active myelination.

By sequencing mRNAs expressed in primary cultures of human astrocytes,
Radomska et al. (2013) identified QKI5, QKI6, QKI7, QKI7b, and a novel
variant that they called QKI6b. QKI6b differs from other QKI variants in
the 3-prime UTR and encodes a protein identical to that encoded by QKI6.
QKI6 and QKI6b were the most abundant QKI transcripts detected in human
astrocytes, and QKI5 was the least abundant. Immunohistochemical
analysis with isoform-specific antibodies revealed that QKI6 and QKI7
were uniformly distributed throughout the nucleus, cell body, and
processes, whereas QKI5 localized to nuclei and was excluded from
nucleoli. Western blot analysis detected QKI6 at an apparent molecular
mass of 38 kD. Both QKI5 and QKI7 had apparent molecular masses of about
40 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Backx et al. (2010) noted that the QKI gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Backx et al. (2010) stated that the QKI gene maps to chromosome 6q26.

The mouse Qki gene maps to chromosome 17 (Ebersole et al., 1996).

GENE FUNCTION

Chen and Richard (1998) showed that the mouse Qk1 proteins homodimerized
in vivo, and they determined that the GSG domain mediated dimerization
and RNA binding. Self-association was mediated by a region of QUA1
predicted to form coiled coils.

Larocque et al. (2002) found that mouse Qk1 proteins bound a short
element in the 3-prime UTR of Mbp (159430). The balance between the
nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms of Qk1 controlled the nuclear export of
Mbp mRNAs and the cellular localization of the 17- and 21.5-kD Mbp
isoforms. Overexpression of Qki-5 in cultured rodent oligodendrocytes
recreated the Mbp defects observed in qk(v) mice, with retention of Mbp
in the nucleus. Larocque et al. (2002) concluded that the QKI proteins
have a role in myelination.

In an mRNA analysis of 55 control human brains, Aberg et al. (2006)
found that QKI mRNA levels accounted for 47% of the coordinated
variation of mRNA levels of 6 oligodendrocyte-related genes, PLP1
(300401), MAG (159460), MBP, TF (190000), SOX10 (602229), and CDKN1B
(600778). In silico analysis identified potential QKI-binding sites in
all of the genes except TF. Variation in the relative expression of
splice variant QKI-7 explained a large fraction of additional mRNA
variation in 3 highly coexpressed genes, MAG, PLP1, and TF. Analysis of
55 brains from patients with schizophrenia (see 181500) showed
significantly decreased expression of MAG, PLP1, and TF compared to
control brains that was associated with decreased levels of QKI-7. Aberg
et al. (2006) concluded that QKI is a regulator of oligodendrocyte
differentiation and maturation in the human brain, and suggested that
splice variants of QKI may play a role in myelin and oligodendrocyte
dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Using yeast 2-hybrid screens, coaffinity purification analysis of
transfected HEK293 cells, and bioinformatic analysis, Lim et al. (2006)
developed an interaction network for 54 human proteins involved in 23
inherited ataxias. By database analysis, they expanded the core network
to include more distantly related interacting proteins that could
function as genetic modifiers. RBPMS (601558) was a main hub in the
network and interacted with many proteins, including the cerebellar
ataxia-associated proteins ATN1 (607462) and QK1.

Using a rat cell line and primary mixed glial cultures from neonatal rat
brain, Chen et al. (2007) showed that Qk1 was necessary and sufficient
for oligodendroglia progenitor cell differentiation. Qk1 isoforms 5, 6,
and 7 differed in their ability to promote oligodendroglia
differentiation, which was dependent on the RNA-binding ability of Qk1.
RNA interference-mediated Qk1 knockdown abrogated differentiation
without affecting proliferation capacity or cell cycle progression.

Using qualitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) examined expression of
putative QKI target mRNAs, including MAGI1 (602625), BCAS1 (602968),
CDKN1B, PLP1, and MAG, in human prefrontal cortex and hippocampus from
fetus to adulthood (up to 46 years of age). Most of the putative QKI
target mRNAs showed increased expression with increasing age in
prefrontal cortex. However, there was little evidence of developmental
regulation of these mRNAs in hippocampus.

Using small interfering RNA, Radomska et al. (2013) found that knockdown
of QKI7 in cultured human astrocytes reduced expression of an astrocyte
differentiation marker, GFAP (137780), but did not reduce cell
viability. The dominant GFAP variant expressed in the astrocytes,
GFAP-alpha, was the most highly downregulated. Radomska et al. (2013)
identified a core QKI regulatory element (QRE) in the 3-prime UTR of the
GFAP-alpha transcript and a potential upstream half-site. The QRE, but
not the half-site, was conserved in mouse Gfap. Exposure of astrocytes
to the antipsychotic drug haloperidol specifically increased expression
of QKI7 and GFAP transcripts.

CYTOGENETICS

Backx et al. (2010) reported a woman with borderline mental retardation
and dysmorphic features who had a de novo reciprocal balanced
translocation t(5;6)(q23.1;q26) disrupting the QKI gene. The 5q
breakpoint occurred in a gene desert. RNA studies showed a 50% reduction
in QKI expression, consistent with haploinsufficiency. She presented at
birth with hypotonia, short neck, genital hypoplasia with underdeveloped
labia majora, and facial dysmorphism including epicanthal folds, narrow
palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge with small nose and bulbous tip,
small mouth with downturned corners, a long philtrum, and small
protruding cupped ears. She attended special education schools.
Evaluation at age 23 years showed relative microcephaly,
microretrognathia, small mouth with high-arched palate, myopia, and
nasal speech. She also had inverted nipples and irregular menses.
Seizures and brain anomalies were not present.

Backx et al. (2010) provided a literature review of 18 patients reported
with chromosome 6qter deletions and 2 patients reported with
interstitial 6q deletion. All deletions included the QKI gene. They
noted that while the deletion sizes varied a common recognizable
phenotype of intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, seizures, brain
anomalies, and specific dysmorphic facial features could be distilled
for the chromosome 6qter deletion syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Recessive mutations in the mouse quaking gene affect myelination and
embryogenesis and can be embryonic lethal. A spontaneous, recessive
quaking mutation, qk(v), results in viable mice with a severe deficit in
myelin, leading to rapid tremor by postnatal day 10. By Northern blot
analysis, Ebersole et al. (1996) detected a truncated Qki message in
brains of qk(v) mice.

Hardy et al. (1996) found that Qki-6 and Qki-7 were absent from
myelin-forming cells in qk(v) mice. Qki-5 was absent only from
oligodendrocytes of tracts from severely affected qk(v) brain regions.

Wu et al. (2002) found misregulated alternative splicing of several
myelin genes in qk(v) mice.

Lu et al. (2003) presented evidence that the qk(v) mutation affects an
enhancer required for expression of Qki in myelinating cells but not in
other tissues.

Chen and Richard (1998) determined that a point mutation within the QUA1
region of Qk1 caused embryonic lethality in mice. The mutation abolished
Qk1 self-association but had no effect on RNA-binding activity.
Expression of wildtype Qk1 or a lethal mutant Qk1 deficient in
self-association but not RNA binding induced cell death by apoptosis in
a mouse fibroblast cell line. The lethal Qk1 mutant was more potent at
inducing apoptosis.

Noveroske et al. (2002) found that embryonic mice with a lethal point
mutation in Qki had defective yolk sac vascular remodeling and abnormal
vessels in the embryo proper at midgestation, coinciding with embryonic
death.

Noveroske et al. (2005) isolated qk(e5), an N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea-induced
viable allele of mouse Qki. Unlike qk(v)/qk(v) mice, qk(e5)/qk(e5) mice
had early-onset seizures, severe ataxia, and a dramatically reduced life
span. Ultrastructural analysis of qk(e5)/qk(e5) brains revealed severe
dysmyelination when compared with both wildtype and qk(v)/qk(v) brains.
Young adult qk(e5)/qk(e5) mice exhibited Purkinje cell axonal swellings
indicative of neurodegeneration, which is not seen in young adult
qk(v)/qk(v) mice. The molecular defect in the qk(e5) allele was not
evident, but protein expression studies showed that qk(e5)/qk(e5)
postnatal oligodendrocytes lacked Qki-6 and Qki-7 and had reduced Qki-5
levels. Several oligodendrocyte developmental markers were present in
qk(e5)/qk(e5) postnatal brain, but Cnp (123830) and Mbp levels were
considerably reduced. Noveroske et al. (2005) noted that qk(v) is a
large deletion that affects expression of Pacrg (608427) and Parkin
(PARK2; 602544) in addition to Qki, complicating interpretation of its
neuropathology. Thus, they suggested that qk(e5) may be useful in
studying QKI regulation in the developing central nervous system and its
role in myelination.

Wilson et al. (2010) noted that the qk(v) phenotype, which includes
dysmyelination of the central nervous system and male sterility, is due
to reduced expression of Qk and a complete lack of Pacrg expression,
respectively. Since Pacrg is required for correct development of the
spermatozoan flagella (a specialized type of motile cilia), Wilson et
al. (2010) analyzed qk(v) mutant mice for evidence of cilial
dysfunction. Histologic and magnetic resonance imaging analyses
demonstrated that qk(v) mutant mice were affected by acquired,
communicating hydrocephalus (HC). Structure of axonemal microtubules and
density of ciliated cells were normal, and cilia length was similar to
wildtype littermates. There was a reduction in ependymal cilial beat
frequency and cilial-mediated flow in qk(v) mutant mice compared with
wildtype littermate controls. Transgenic expression of Pacrg was
necessary and sufficient to correct this deficit and rescue the HC
phenotype in the qk(v) mutant. Wilson et al. (2010) concluded that Pacrg
is required for motile cilia function and may be involved in the
pathogenesis of human ciliopathies, such as HC, asthenospermia, and
primary ciliary dyskinesia.
