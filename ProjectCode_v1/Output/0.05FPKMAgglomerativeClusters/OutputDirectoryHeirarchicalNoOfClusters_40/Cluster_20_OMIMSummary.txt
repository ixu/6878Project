DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the lipocalin family, such as LCN10, have a common structure
consisting of an 8-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel that forms a
cup-shaped ligand-binding pocket or calyx. Lipocalins generally bind
small hydrophobic ligands and transport them to specific cells (Suzuki
et al., 2004).

CLONING

Suzuki et al. (2004) cloned mouse Lcn10, which encodes a deduced
182-amino acid protein. They identified human LCN10 by database
analysis. Northern blot analysis detected Lcn10 expression in mouse
epididymis only, and epididymal expression began at 3 weeks of age. In
situ hybridization detected Lcn10 in the epithelium lining the initial
segment and segment 2 of mouse epididymis.

GENE FUNCTION

Suzuki et al. (2004) found that expression of Lcn10 in mouse epididymis
disappeared after castration and was only partially restored by
testosterone administration.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Suzuki et al. (2004) mapped the LCN10 gene
to an LCN gene cluster on chromosome 9q34. They mapped the mouse Lcn10
gene to a syntenic region of mouse chromosome 2A3.

;;T-BOX EXPRESSED IN T CELLS; TBET
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Naive T helper (Th) cells differentiate into 2 subsets, Th1 and Th2,
each with distinct functions and cytokine profiles. TBX21 is a
Th1-specific T-box transcription factor that controls the expression of
the hallmark Th1 cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) (Szabo et
al., 2000).

CLONING

Using a yeast 1-hybrid approach, Szabo et al. (2000) isolated clones
encoding murine Tbx21, which they called 'T-box expressed in T cells,'
or Tbet. The murine Tbx21 gene encodes a deduced 530-amino acid protein
containing a 189-amino acid T-box DNA-binding domain that shows homology
to murine Tbr1 (604616) and Xenopus eomesodermin (EOMES; 604615). The
authors subsequently cloned human TBX21, which encodes a 535-amino acid
protein that shares 88% amino acid identity with murine Tbx21. Northern
blot analysis detected TBX21 expression in lung, thymus, and spleen.

Zhang and Yang (2000) also cloned and characterized TBX21. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of a 2.7-kb transcript in peripheral blood
leukocytes, spleen, and lung, as well as in NK cell lines. No expression
was detected in mouse embryonic tissue.

GENE FUNCTION

Szabo et al. (2000) showed that TBX21 expression correlates with IFNG
expression in Th1 and natural killer (NK) cells. Ectopic expression of
TBX21 both transactivated the IFNG gene and induced endogenous IFNG
production. Retroviral gene transduction of TBX21 into polarized Th2 and
Tc2 primary T cells redirected them into Th1 and Tc1 cells,
respectively, as evidenced by the simultaneous induction of IFNG and
repression of interleukin-4 (IL4; 147780) and interleukin-5 (IL5;
147850). Szabo et al. (2000) concluded that TBX21 initiates Th1 lineage
development from naive Th precursor cells both by activating Th1 genetic
programs and by repressing the opposing Th2 programs.

Differentiation of T helper cells into mature Th2 cells is associated
with chromatin remodeling of the IL4 and IL13 (147683) genes, whereas
differentiation into Th1 cells evokes chromatin remodeling of the IFNG
gene (Agarwal and Rao, 1998). Also, polarized Th2 cells do not express
IL12RB2 (601642) and therefore do not signal in response to IL12
(161560). However, Smits et al. (2001) found that anti-CD3/anti-CD28
stimulation of Th2 cells from either normal individuals or atopic
patients in the presence of IL12 restored IL12RB2 expression and
signaling. The change to a stable Th0/Th1 phenotype was accompanied by a
loss of GATA3 (131320) expression, a hallmark of the Th2 phenotype, and
the induction of TBX21 expression. Smits et al. (2001) proposed that the
human Th2 phenotype is less stable than that observed in the mouse and
that an IL12-promoting therapeutic approach might be beneficial for
Th2-mediated immune disorders.

Using real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR, Grogan et al. (2001) showed that
Tbet expression is optimal after stimulation with IL12 in wildtype but
not Stat4 (600558)-deficient mice.

Using RT-PCR, Mullen et al. (2001) showed that Tbet expression is
suppressed in the presence of IL4 and anti-IL12, but that Tbet is
expressed in the absence of IL12 and in the presence of anti-IL4.
Ectopic expression of Tbet restored Ifng expression in Stat4-deficient
cells, targeted the remodeling of the Ifng locus, and induced expression
of Il12rb2. Flow cytometric analysis showed that IL12 enhances and
prolongs Ifng expression in Tbet-differentiated Th1 cells through an
interaction with CREB-binding protein (see CREBBP; 600140). Mullen et
al. (2001) suggested that TBET is upstream of the STAT4 pathway. They
also proposed that cytokines may not induce differentiation of T helper
cells but may instead act as essential secondary stimuli that mediate
selective survival of a lineage.

Finotto et al. (2002) observed reduced expression of the T(H)1
transcription factor Tbet in T cells from airways of patients with
asthma compared with that in T cells from airways of nonasthmatic
patients, suggesting that loss of Tbet might be associated with asthma.

Tbet is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors that
appears to regulate lineage commitment in CD4 T helper cells in part by
activating the hallmark T(H)1 cytokine, IFN-gamma (147570). IFN-gamma is
also produced by NK cells and most prominently by CD8 cytotoxic T cells,
and is vital for the control of microbial pathogens. Although Tbet is
expressed in all these cell types, Szabo et al. (2002) demonstrated that
it is required for control of IFN-gamma production in CD4 and NK cells,
but not in CD8 cells. This difference is also apparent in the function
of these cell subsets. Thus, Szabo et al. (2002) concluded that the
regulation of a single cytokine, IFN-gamma, is controlled by distinct
transcriptional mechanisms within the T cell lineage. Szabo et al.
(2002) studied mice deficient in Tbet and established that Tbet is a
transcription factor required for T(H)1 lineage commitment.

Liu et al. (2003) noted that CpG dinucleotides have prophylactic and
therapeutic effects in allergies that have been associated with the
selective downregulation of IgE (147180 )and Th2 cytokine production in
mouse models and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from atopic
patients. CpG acts through TLR9 (605474), which is not expressed by T
cells. Liu et al. (2003) found that treatment of mouse splenocytes or
human B lymphocytes with CpG (ODN 2006) upregulated expression of TBET
in these cells by a mechanism dependent on TLR9 and independent of IFNG
and STAT1 (600555). CpG did not upregulate TBET in T cells. Using
specific inhibitors, the authors showed that TBET mRNA expression
required NFKB (see 164011), p38 (MAPK14; 600289), and IL12. Functional
analysis indicated that CpG completely inhibited IgE secretion induced
by IL4 and CD40 (109535) ligation and that IgG1 (147100) was severely
reduced. Liu et al. (2003) proposed that the K type of CpG (e.g., ODN
2006), which has a phosphorothioate backbone, may be a preferable
therapeutic CpG drug compared with the D type, which preferentially
stimulates IFNG and produces low levels of TNFA (191160), results
associated with inflammatory side effects.

Fields et al. (2002) noted that high levels of histone acetylation at
particular loci correlate with transcriptional activity, whereas reduced
levels correlate with silencing. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP), PCR, and green fluorescent protein analysis, they demonstrated
that histones in the cytokine loci (IFNG and IL4) of naive T cells are
unacetylated, but upon TCR stimulation, the loci are rapidly and
progressively acetylated on histones H3 and H4. The acetylation at the
IL4 locus occurs early, regardless of Th1/Th2 polarizing conditions,
correlating with early transcription. The maintenance of acetylation
depends on cytokine and STAT4 and STAT6 (601512) signaling and also on
the transactivator activity of TBET and GATA3, the putative 'master
regulators' of Th lineage determination.

Hwang et al. (2005) reported that TBET represses Th2 lineage commitment
through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between itself and GATA3
that interferes with the binding of GATA3 to its target DNA. Hwang et
al. (2005) concluded that their results provide a novel function for
tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in specifying
alternate fates of a common progenitor cell. Hwang et al. (2005) showed
that TBET phosphorylation is restricted to the TEC kinases ITK (186973)
and RLK (600058). Coexpression studies demonstrated that this was most
efficiently performed by ITK. In primary CD4 T cells isolated from ITK-,
RLK-, or double ITK/RLK-deficient mice, the greatest diminution of TBET
tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in the absence of ITK. Furthermore,
mutation of TBET at tyrosine residue 525, but not control tyrosine
residue 437, resulted in greatly reduced phosphorylation by ITK,
revealing that ITK phosphorylates TBET at residue Y525 after T cell
receptor stimulation.

Hohler et al. (2005) examined monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins
for cytokine production and transcription factors controlling Th1/Th2
differentiation and observed low intrapair variability in MZ compared
with DZ twins in expression of IFNG, TNF, and TBET. In contrast, MZ and
DZ twins were equally similar in terms of IL4 production and GATA3
expression. Hohler et al. (2005) proposed that Th1, but not Th2,
responses are genetically determined and that Th2-associated diseases in
humans may be due to genetic variations in Th1 cytokine regulation via
TBET.

Chen et al. (2006) noted that activated T cells, particularly Th1 cells,
express sialyl Lewis x, but resting T cells do not. Using reporter
analysis, they showed that TBET promoted and GATA3 repressed
transcription of FUT7 (602030), the rate-limiting enzyme for sialyl
Lewis x synthesis. TBET interfered with GATA3 binding to its target DNA,
but GATA3 also interfered with TBET binding to the FUT7 promoter. GATA3
regulated FUT7 transcription by recruiting, in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner, histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3; 605166)
and HDAC5 (605315) and by competing with CBP/p300 (EP300; 602700) in
binding to the N terminus of TBET. Maximal expression of FUT7 and sialyl
Lewis x in T cells was obtained by ROG (ZBTB32; 605859)-mediated
suppression of GATA3. Chen et al. (2006) concluded that the GATA3/TBET
transcription factor complex regulates cell lineage-specific expression
of lymphocyte homing receptors and that glycoconjugates are regulated by
this complex to attain cell lineage-specific expression in Th1 and Th2
lymphocyte subsets.

Intlekofer et al. (2008) demonstrated that CD8+ T cells deficient in the
transcription factors Tbet and eomesodermin (Eomes) (604615) fail to
differentiate into functional killers required for defense against
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Instead, virus-specific CD8+ T cells
lacking both Tbet and Eomes differentiated into an interleukin-17 (IL17;
603149)-secreting lineage, reminiscent of the helper T cell fate that
has been implicated in autoimmunity and extracellular microbial defense.
Upon viral infection, mice with T cells lacking both Tbet and Eomes
develop a CD8+ T cell-dependent, progressive inflammatory and wasting
syndrome characterized by multiorgan infiltration of neutrophils.
Intlekofer et al. (2008) concluded that Tbet and Eomes ensure that CD8+
T cells adopt an appropriate course of intracellular rather than
extracellular destruction.

CD4+ T helper cells that selectively produce interleukin-17 (Th17) are
critical for host defense and immunity. Ghoreschi et al. (2010) showed
that Th17 differentiation can occur in the absence of TGF-beta (190180)
signaling. Neither IL6 (147620) nor IL23 (see 605580) alone efficiently
generated Th17 cells; however, these cytokines in combination with
IL1-beta (147720) effectively induced IL17 production in naive
precursors, independently of TGF-beta. Epigenetic modification of the
IL17A (603149), IL17F (606496), and RORC (602943) promoters proceeded
without TGF-beta-1, allowing the generation of cells that coexpressed
ROR-gamma-t (encoded by RORC) and Tbet. Tbet+ROR-gamma-t+Th17 cells are
generated in vivo during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and
adoptively transferred Th17 cells generated with IL23 without TGF-beta-1
were pathogenic in this disease model. Ghoreschi et al. (2010) concluded
that their data indicated an alternative mode for Th17 differentiation,
and that, consistent with genetic data linking IL23R (607562) with
autoimmunity, their findings reemphasized the importance of IL23 and
therefore may have therapeutic implications.

Paley et al. (2012) found that 2 distinct states of virus-specific CD8+
T cells exist in chronically infected mice and humans. Differential
expression of the T-box transcription factors Tbet and Eomesodermin
(Eomes) facilitated the cooperative maintenance of the pool of antiviral
CD8+ T cells during chronic viral infection. Tbet(hi) cells displayed
low intrinsic turnover but proliferated in response to persisting
antigen, giving rise to Eomes(hi) terminal progeny. Genetic elimination
of either subset resulted in failure to control chronic infection, which
suggested that an imbalance in differentiation and renewal could
underlie the collapse of immunity in humans with chronic infections.

Klose et al. (2013) provided evidence that the transcription factor Tbet
determines the fate of a distinct lineage of CCR6 (601835)-negative
ROR-gamma-t (602943)-positive innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Postnatally
emerging CCR6-ROR-gamma-t+ ILCs upregulated Tbet, and this was
controlled by cues from the commensal microbiota and IL23 (605580). In
contrast, CCR6+ROR-gamma-t+ ILCs, which arise earlier during ontogeny,
did not express Tbet. Tbet instructed the expression of Tbet target
genes such as interferon-gamma (147570) and of the natural cytotoxicity
receptor NKp46 (604530). Mice genetically lacking Tbet showed normal
development of CCR6-ROR-gamma-t innate lymphoid cells, but these cells
could not differentiate into NKp46-expressing ROR-gamma-t+ ILCs (i.e.,
IL22 (605330)-producing natural killer cells) and failed to produce
interferon-gamma. The production of interferon-gamma by Tbet-expressing
CCR6-ROR-gamma-t+ ILCs was essential for the release of mucus-forming
glycoproteins required to protect the epithelial barrier against
Salmonella enterica infection. Klose et al. (2013) concluded that
coexpression of Tbet and ROR-gamma-t, which is also found in subsets of
IL17-producing T-helper cells, may be an evolutionarily conserved
transcriptional program that originally developed as part of the innate
defense against infections but that also confers an increased risk of
immune-mediated pathology.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang and Yang (2000) determined by genomic sequence analysis that the
mouse and human TBX21 genes contain 6 exons.

MAPPING

Zhang and Yang (2000) mapped the mouse Tbx21 gene to chromosome 11D in
an area showing homology of synteny with human chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Finotto et al. (2002) generated mice lacking the Tbet gene by targeted
disruption. Heterozygous or homozygous knockout mice exhibited airway
hyperresponsiveness in response to methacholine. Tbet homozygous
knockout mice showed peribronchial and perivenular infiltration with
eosinophils and lymphocytes compared with wildtype littermates. Tbet
heterozygotes, which display only 50% reduction of Tbet protein
expression, displayed a phenotype very similar to that of mice with a
complete absence of Tbet. Tbet heterozygotes and homozygote knockout
mice also demonstrated thickening of the airway subbasement membrane
collagen layer as well as increased expression of some cytokines.
However, the asthma-like phenotype in these mice was independent of
allergen exposure and was not altered by allergen exposure. Finotto et
al. (2002) concluded that mice with a targeted deletion of the Tbet gene
and severe combined immunodeficient mice receiving CD4(+) cells from
Tbet knockout mice spontaneously demonstrated multiple physiologic and
inflammatory features characteristic of asthma.

By replacing the C terminus of Tbet, which contains the trans-activation
domain, with the repression domain of the Drosophila 'engrailed' protein
(see 131290), Mullen et al. (2002) generated a dominant-negative (DN)
Tbet cDNA. Introduction of DN Tbet into cells developing under
Th1-inducing conditions, but not into mature Th1 cells, substantially
inhibited their capacity to express Ifng and resulted in defective
persistence of hypersensitivity site I chromatin within Ifng. Levels of
Il12rb2, however, were reduced in both developing and mature Th1 cells
by DN Tbet. Screening for homeobox factors expressed in Th1 cells by
oligonucleotide array and RT-PCR analysis determined that only Hlx
(142995) is expressed at higher levels in Th1 lymphocytes than in Th2
lymphocytes. Hlx appeared at a slower rate than Tbet and could be
induced by Tbet. Ectopic expression in Stat4 -/- Th2-like cells of both
Tbet and Hlx allowed maximal and synergistic expression of Ifng in these
cells. Introduction of DN Tbet into mature Th1 cells inhibited the
expression of Hlx.

Svensson et al. (2005) noted that both Il15 (600554) -/- mice, which
lack NK and NKT cells, and Ifng -/- mice are highly susceptible to
genital herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 infection. CD4-positive T cells and
IFNG are the most important components of acquired immunity to genital
HSV-2 infection, and impaired HSV-2-specific IFNG responses in humans
correlate with recurrent clinical disease. Svensson et al. (2005)
vaginally infected Tbet -/- mice with HSV-2. Tbet -/- mice had increased
vaginal and spinal cord viral titers, more severe disease, shorter time
to death, reduced NK-cell activity, impaired Ifng production, lower
specific antibody production, and fewer splenic B cells compared with
wildtype mice. These differences were even more marked in mice first
vaccinated with an attenuated HSV-2 strain and then challenged with
virulent HSV-2. However, CD8-positive T cell-mediated cytotoxicity was
actually stronger in Tbet -/- mice compared with wildtype mice. Svensson
et al. (2005) concluded that TBET is important in both innate defense
and for generation of protective Th1 immunity against genital HSV-2
infection, primarily through its control of NK and CD4-positive T-cell
function.

Ravindran et al. (2005) noted that Tbet-deficient mice resolve infection
with the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes despite having
only small numbers of Cd4-positive Ifng-producing T cells. In contrast,
they found that challenge of Tbet -/- mice with an attenuated Salmonella
strain resulted in death of most mice in less than a month. Tbet -/-
mice failed to produce Ifng and to switch immunoglobulin isotypes.
Spleen cells of infected Tbet -/- mice did not produce Ifng, but they
did secrete increased levels of Il10 (124092), but not Il4. Ravindran et
al. (2005) concluded that CD4-positive T cells expressing TBET are
required for development of Salmonella-specific Th1 cells, regulation of
IL10 production, and resistance to Salmonella infection.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Wang et al. (2006) found expression
of TBET in inflammatory infiltrates of human synovial tissue from
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300). Tbet -/- mice with the
collagen antibody-induced arthritis model of RA had markedly reduced
joint inflammation at both early and late time points. Mice lacking both
Rag2 (179616) and Tbet were resistant to disease. However, adoptive
transfer of dendritic cells expressing Tbet reconstituted inflammation
in both Tbet -/- and Tbet -/- Rag2 -/- mice. Wang et al. (2006)
concluded that TBET has a vital role in DCs that links innate and
adaptive immunity to regulate inflammatory responses.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ASTHMA, ASPIRIN-INDUCED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ASTHMA AND NASAL POLYPS, INCLUDED
TBX21, -1993T-C

Akahoshi et al. (2005) identified a -1993T-C SNP in the promoter region
of the TBX21 gene and found that the substitution increases the affinity
of an unknown nuclear protein for the binding site in that region,
resulting in increased transcriptional activity of the TBX21 gene. There
was a significant association between the promoter SNP and
aspirin-induced asthma (see 208550) in a Japanese cohort (p = 0.004),
with increased risk associated with a C allele (OR = 1.93; 95% CI,
1.22-3.06). The association was confirmed in additional independent
samples from patients with asthma and nasal polyposis (see 208550)
regardless of aspirin hypersensitivity (p = 0.008).

603960	TITLE *603960 CALICIN; CCIN
DESCRIPTION In mammalian sperm, the dense cytoplasmic webs surrounding the nuclei
contain a complex structure called the perinuclear theca. In bovine
sperm heads, the perinuclear theca is subdivided into the anterior
subacrosomal layer and the posterior calyx, a funnel-shaped, dense, and
stable structure tightly surrounding the posterior part of the nucleus
on its inner side and apposed to the plasma membrane on the outer side.
Longo et al. (1987) determined that 2 kinds of basic proteins are the
major constituents of the thecal structure: calicin, a 60-kD protein
localized almost exclusively to the calyx, and a group of multiple-band
polypeptides (MBPs or cylicins; see 300768) that are found both in the
calyx and the subacrosomal layer. They speculated that during
spermiogenesis, these insoluble basic proteins contribute to the
formation of the perinuclear theca as an architectural element involved
in the shape changes and the intimate association of the nucleus with
the acrosome and the plasma membrane.

Von Bulow et al. (1995) purified calicin from bull sperm and determined
a partial protein sequence. By PCR analysis of testis cDNA with
oligonucleotide primers based on the calicin protein sequence, they
isolated bovine and human cDNAs encoding calicin. The predicted bovine
protein contains 588 amino acids and has a calculated pI of 8.1. The
partial human cDNA encodes a protein that starts at a position
corresponding to the fourth amino acid of bovine calicin. Overall, the 2
calicins are 91% identical. There are 3 consecutive repeats in the
middle of the calicin protein. Sequence comparisons revealed that
calicin shares homology with the Drosophila kelch protein, which is
associated with the actin-rich intercellular bridges (ring canals) in
the egg chamber that connect the oocyte and the nurse cells. Von Bulow
et al. (1995) noted that calicin is missing or is arranged in a
dramatically different pattern in the heads of malformed human
spermatozoa such as teratozoospermias with 'round-headed' sperm or with
other 'postacrosomal sheath defects.'

604386	TITLE *604386 ZINC FINGER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TRPS1; TRPS1
;;TRPS1 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRPS1 is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor involved in the
regulation of chondrocyte and perichondrium development (Napierala et
al., 2008).

CLONING

Momeni et al. (2000) positionally cloned a gene that spanned the
chromosomal breakpoint in 2 patients with trichorhinophalangeal syndrome
type I (TRPS I; 190350) and was deleted in 5 patients with TRPS I
associated with an interstitial deletion. Northern blot analyses
revealed transcripts of 7 and 10.5 kb. The gene, designated TRPS1,
encodes a polypeptide of 1,281 amino acids. The predicted protein
sequence has 2 potential nuclear localization signals (LRRRRG and
RRRTRKR) and an unusual combination of different zinc finger motifs,
including IKAROS-like (see 603023) and GATA-binding (see 600576)
sequences. Kaiser et al. (2004) presented evidence that only one of the
basic amino acid sequences, the RRRTRKR motif (amino acids 946-952),
acts as a nuclear localization signal.

GENE STRUCTURE

Momeni et al. (2000) determined that the TRPS1 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Momeni et al. (2000) mapped the TRPS1 gene
to chromosome 8q24.

GENE FUNCTION

Kaiser et al. (2003) found that 2 distinct regions of the nuclear
transcription factor TRPS1 can physically interact with the dynein light
chain protein DNCL1 (601562). Region A covers 89 amino acids (635-723),
spanning 3 potential C2H2 zinc finger structures, and region B covers
the 100 most C-terminal amino acids (1182-1281) containing the
IKAROS-like motif. DNCL1 colocalized with TRPS1 in dot-like structures
in the cell nucleus. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that
the interaction of DNCL1 and TRPS1 lowered the binding of TRPS1 to the
GATA consensus sequence. In addition, a GATA-regulated reporter gene
assay indicated that DNCL1 could suppress the transcriptional repression
activity of TRPS1.

Radvanyi et al. (2005) performed a comprehensive differential gene
expression screen on a panel of 54 breast tumors and more than 200
normal tissue samples and identified 15 genes specifically overexpressed
in breast cancer, of which one of the most prevalent was TRPS1. The
microarray findings were confirmed by in situ hybridization as well as
immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis of breast tumor cell lines.
Immunohistochemistry analysis found TRPS1 protein expressed in greater
than 90% of early- and late-stage breast cancer, including ductal
carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal, lobular, and papillary
carcinomas.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Momeni et al. (2000) identified 6 different nonsense mutations in the
TRPS1 gene (604386.0001-604386.0006) in 10 unrelated patients with
trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I (TRPS1; 190350). The findings
suggested that haploinsufficiency for this putative transcription factor
causes TRPS I.

To investigate whether trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type III (190351)
is caused by TRPS1 mutations and to establish a genotype-phenotype
correlation in TRPS, Ludecke et al. (2001) performed extensive mutation
analysis and evaluated height and degree of brachydactyly in patients
with TRPS I or TRPS III. They found 35 different mutations in 44 of 51
unrelated patients. The detection rate (86%) indicated that TRPS1 is the
major locus for TRPS I and TRPS III. They found no mutation in the
parents of sporadic patients or in apparently healthy relatives of
familial patients, indicating complete penetrance of TRPS1 mutations.
Evaluation of skeletal abnormalities of patients with TRPS1 mutations
revealed a wide clinical spectrum. The phenotype was variable in
unrelated, age- and sex-matched patients with identical mutations, as
well as in families. Four of the 5 missense mutations altered the GATA
DNA-binding zinc finger, and 6 of the 7 unrelated patients with these
mutations could be classified as having TRPS III, because they had
severe brachydactyly, due to short metacarpals, and severe short
stature. The data indicated that TRPS III is at the severe end of the
TRPS spectrum and that it is most often caused by a specific class of
mutations in exon 6 the TRPS1 gene. In the study of Ludecke et al.
(2001), 5 mutations were recurrent, and 4 of these were identified in
patients of different ethnicities: 1 in patients of Norwegian, Turkish,
and Belgian extraction, and another in patients of Belgian, Turkish, and
Japanese extraction, for example.

Kobayashi et al. (2002) identified a missense mutation in exon 6 of the
TRPS1 gene (604386.0009) in type III TRPS, reinforcing the conclusion of
Ludecke et al. (2001).

In cases of type III TRPS, Hilton et al. (2002) found 2 missense
mutations in the GATA DNA-binding zinc finger: R908Q (now R921Q;
604386.0009), a recurrent mutation, and A919V (now A932V; 604386.0010),
a de novo mutation.

In cases of type I TRPS, Kaiser et al. (2004) identified the first 2
missense mutations that do not affect the GATA zinc finger
(604386.0011-604386.0012).

Ludecke et al. (1995) presented evidence that the trichorhinophalangeal
syndrome type II, or Langer-Giedion syndrome (150230), is a contiguous
gene syndrome due to loss of functional copies of both the TRPS1 and
EXT1 (608177) genes.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Investigations have demonstrated that most patients with nonsense
mutations in the TRPS1 gene have the less severe TRPS type I phenotype
(Momeni et al., 2000; Hatamura et al., 2001), while patients with
missense mutations in the GATA-type zinc-finger region of the TRPS1 gene
have the more severe TRPS type III phenotype (Ludecke et al., 2001;
Hilton et al., 2002). Piccione et al. (2009) presented evidence
supporting this hypothesis. They reported 2 unrelated patients with TRPS
types I and III who had heterozygous nonsense and missense mutations,
respectively, in the TRPS1 gene. The patient with type I TRPS had
haploinsufficiency of TRPS1, whereas the patient with type III TRPS had
an allele causing functional modification of the GATA-type motif,
possibly inducing a dominant-negative effect on DNA transcription
regulation and leading to a more severe phenotype.

CYTOGENETICS

Fantauzzo et al. (2008) analyzed the cytogenetic breakpoints of 3
patients with hypertrichosis universalis congenita, Ambras type (HTC1;
145701), including patients ME-1 and SS-1, originally reported by
Baumeister et al. (1993) and Balducci et al. (1998), respectively. They
identified a pericentric inversion in chromosome 8q23.1 that lies 7.3 Mb
downstream of the TRPS1 gene in patient ME-1, a 6.7-Mb deletion that
encompasses the TRPS1 gene in patient SS-1, and a 1.5-Mb deletion in
chromosome 8q24.1 that lies 2.1 Mb upstream of the TRPS1 gene in patient
BN-1. There was no overlap between the breakpoints in the 3 patients, so
the authors defined the entire 11.5-Mb interval between markers RH62506
and D8S269 containing 20 genes, including the TRPS1 gene, as the
candidate interval. Southern blot analysis was suggestive of deletion of
TRPS1 in patient SS-1, and no RNA was available for patient BN-1.
Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated significant downregulation of TRPS1 in
patient ME-1, suggesting that the inversion breakpoint 7.3 Mb downstream
from the TRPS1 gene reduced expression, consistent with a position
effect. Fantauzzo et al. (2008) suggested that position effect causing
downregulation of TRPS1 expression is the probable cause of
hypertrichosis in Ambras syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Malik et al. (2002) reported that mice heterozygous for deletion of the
DNA-binding GATA domain of Trps1 (delta-GT mutation) displayed facial
anomalies that overlapped with findings for TRPS, whereas mice
homozygous for the delta-GT mutation additionally showed a complete
absence of vibrissae. Unexpectedly, homozygous delta-GT mice died of
neonatal respiratory failure resulting from abnormalities of the
thoracic spine and ribs. Delta-GT heterozygotes also developed thoracic
kyphoscoliosis with age and had structural deficits in cortical and
trabecular bones. The findings directly implicated the GATA-type zinc
finger of TRPS1 in regulation of bone and hair development and suggested
that skeletal abnormalities emphasized in descriptions of TRPS are only
the extreme manifestations of a generalized bone dysplasia.

Napierala et al. (2008) found that mice homozygous for the Trps1
delta-GT mutation showed elongation of the growth plate due to delayed
chondrocyte differentiation and abnormal mineralization of
perichondrium. These abnormalities were accompanied by increased Runx2
(600211) and Ihh (600726) expression and increased Ihh signaling.
Cotransfection experiments showed that wildtype Trps1 bound Runx2 and
repressed Runx2-mediated activation of a reporter plasmid. Double
heterozygosity for Trps1 delta-GT and a Runx2-null mutation rescued the
opposite growth plate phenotypes found in single mutants. Napierala et
al. (2008) concluded that TRPS1 and RUNX2 interact to regulate
chondrocyte and perichondrium development.

Fantauzzo et al. (2008) analyzed koala ('Koa') mice, which represent a
mouse model of hypertrichosis and have a semidominant, radiation-induced
chromosomal inversion near the mouse ortholog of Trps1, and found that
the proximal breakpoint of the Koa inversion is located 791 kb upstream
of the Trps1 gene. Quantitative RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and
immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Trps1 expression levels are
reduced in Koa mutant mice at the sites of pathology for the phenotype,
including muzzle and dorsal skin and cells surrounding the developing
vibrissae follicles. Fantauzzo et al. (2008) determined that the Koa
inversion created a new Sp1 binding site and translocated additional Sp1
binding sites within a highly conserved stretch spanning the proximal
breakpoint, providing a potential mechanism for a position effect.

Kobayashi et al. (2002) reported a Japanese family in which
trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type III (190351) segregated with a
2723G-A substitution in exon 6 of the TRPS1 gene, resulting in an

In a father and daughter from Portugal with TRPS I (190350), Kaiser et
al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a 2854C-T transition in the
TRPS1 gene, resulting in an arg952-to-cys (R952C) substitution. The
mutation prevents the transport of the TRPS1 protein into the nucleus
and thus reduces the nuclear TRPS1 concentration, consistent with
haploinsufficiency.

TRICHORHINOPHALANGEAL SYNDROME, TYPE I
TRPS1, ARG952HIS

Based on a renumbering of the TRPS1 gene sequence, the mutation

610365	TITLE *610365 C1q- AND TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-RELATED PROTEIN 1; C1QTNF1
;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN; GIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the second intracellular loop of V2R (AVPR2; 300538) as bait in a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human kidney cDNA library, followed by RACE
of heart and HEK293 mRNA, Innamorati et al. (2002) cloned C1QTNF1, which
they called GIP. The deduced protein contains 379 amino acids. The
extracellular N terminus contains a TNF (see 191160) family
cysteine-rich region, followed by a transmembrane domain, a C-terminal
collagen-like sequence of 14 Gly-X-Y repeats, and a globular domain.
Northern blot analysis detected prominent expression in heart and lower
expression in placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, prostate and
ovary. Little to no expression was detected in other tissues examined.
In transfected HEK293 and COS cells, epitope-tagged GIP was expressed in
vesicular structures surrounding the nucleus and near the cell surface.
Western blot analysis detected epitope-tagged GIP at about 40 kD and 130
kD, suggesting GIP can form trimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay and pull-down experiments, Innamorati et
al. (2002) confirmed the interaction between the second intracellular
loop of V2R and the C-terminal portion of GIP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Innamorati et al. (2002) determined that the C1QTNF1 gene contains 3
coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Innamorati et al. (2002) mapped the
C1QTNF1 gene to chromosome 17q25.

194558	TITLE *194558 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 83; ZNF83
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Marine et al. (1994) assigned the ZNF83 gene (also known as HPF1) to
chromosome 19 by screening a human/rodent hybrid panel and localized the
gene further to 19q13.3-q13.4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and
digital imaging microscopy.

HISTORY

Conserved structural motifs define large families of nucleic acid
binding proteins in eukaryotes. The C2H2-type zinc finger motif,
conferring both specific RNA and DNA binding activities, was first
detected within the amino acid sequence of the Xenopus transcription
factor IIIA (Miller et al., 1985). Thereafter, vertebrate genomes were
shown to encode hundreds of so-called zinc finger proteins (ZFPs).
Subfamilies were defined on the basis of conserved sequence elements
outside the finger repeat, such as the KRAB domain. Several members of
these subfamilies were found to have a clustered genomic organization.

KIAA0238
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The absorption of vitamin C into the body and its distribution to organs
requires the sodium-coupled vitamin C transporters SVCT1 (603790) and
SVCT2. SVCT1 is largely confined to epithelial surfaces involved in bulk
transport, such as those of the intestine and kidney, and is involved in
maintenance of whole-body homeostasis, through dietary absorption and
renal reabsorption. SVCT2 appears to account for tissue-specific uptake
of vitamin C. SVCT2 expression is widespread, occurring in neurons, the
endocrine system, bone, and other tissues, thus protecting metabolically
active tissues from oxidative stress (Hediger, 2002 and Savini et al.,
2008).

CLONING

During investigation of the importance of L-ascorbic acid transport in
regulating the supply and metabolism of vitamin C, Tsukaguchi et al.
(1999) isolated a 6.5-kb cDNA encoding a 592-amino acid protein, SVCT2,
from a rat brain cDNA library. This protein exhibits 65% amino acid
identity with rat SVCT1. SVCT2 is expressed in a host of metabolically
active cells and specialized tissues in the brain, eye, and other
organs. SVCT2 has 12 transmembrane domains, 2 possible sites for
N-glycosylation, and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.

As part of a project of sequencing human cDNA clones that correspond to
relatively long and nearly full-length transcripts, Nagase et al. (1996)
cloned KIAA0238, a 5,608-bp cDNA encoding a protein of 330 amino acids.
Tsukaguchi et al. (1999) determined that rat SVCT2 shares 84% amino acid
identity with KIAA0238 and stated that KIAA0238 may represent the human
homolog of SVCT2.

By searching for sequences similar to Aspergillus nidulans purine
transporters, followed by 5-prime RACE of a human kidney cDNA library,
Faaland et al. (1998) cloned SLC23A2, which they called YSPL2. The
deduced 650-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 70 kD.
It has 12 transmembrane domains, 2 blocks of similarity with
xanthine/uracil transporters, 2 potential N-glycosylation sites, and 3
putative phosphorylation sites. The N and C termini are predicted to be
intracellular. Northern blot analysis detected an 8-kb transcript in
heart, brain, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas. EST database
analysis indicated that YSPL2 is expressed in other human tissues and
cell types, particularly in fetal tissues.

Using SVCT1 (SLC23A1) to probe a human placenta cell line cDNA library,
Rajan et al. (1999) cloned SVCT2. Northern blot analysis detected a
major transcript of 7.5 kb highly expressed in brain, placenta, and
liver and more weakly expressed in heart, but not in lung or skeletal
muscle. Placenta expressed an additional transcript of 4.0 kb.

By PCR of a human fetal brain cDNA library, Lutsenko et al. (2004)
cloned a splice variant of SVCT2 that encodes a truncated protein
lacking the last 115 amino acids, including intracellular domains 5 and
6 and part of domain 4. PCR analysis detected the short variant in all
adult and fetal tissues examined. The long and short SVCT2 variants were
expressed in transfected human embryonic kidney cells as proteins of
about 80 and 70 kD, respectively.

By RT-PCR, Rubin et al. (2005) showed that several human cell lines
preferentially expressed SVCT2 from the exon 1b promoter compared to the
exon 1a promoter but that the ratio of preference varied widely.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying transport activity in transfected human retinal pigment
epithelial cells, Rajan et al. (1999) showed that SVCT2 specifically
transported radiolabeled ascorbate, but not any other vitamin tested.
Transport was saturable and completely dependent upon extracellular Na+.
Kinetic analysis revealed that the relationship between ascorbate uptake
and Na+ concentration was sigmoidal, indicating that for every ascorbate
molecule transported, 2 Na+ ions were cotransported.

By cotransfection in human embryonic kidney cells, Lutsenko et al.
(2004) showed that the C-terminally truncated isoform of SVCT2 inhibited
ascorbic acid transport by the longer isoform in a dose-dependent manner
and that inhibition was due to direct protein-protein interaction
between the short and long variants. By examining the level of
endogenous short and long variants in human cell lines, Lutsenko et al.
(2004) found that the ability of cells to transport ascorbic acid was
inversely proportional to the amount of short isoform expressed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rubin et al. (2005) identified alternative exons 1a and 1b of the
SLC23A2 gene that are separated by about 8.8 kb and have upstream
promoter sequences. The promoter upstream of exon 1b is TATA- and
CAAT-less and has a GC content of 73%. Rubin et al. (2005) identified
several specific transcription factor binding sites in both promoter
regions and determined that translation start site is in exon 3.

Savini et al. (2008) stated that the SLC23A2 gene contains 17 exons and
spans 158.4 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nagase et al. (1996)
mapped the SLC23A2 gene to human chromosome 20. By genomic sequence
analysis, Faaland et al. (1998) mapped the SLC23A2 gene to chromosome
20p13-p12.

;;MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; MRP1;;
MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; MRP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cole et al. (1992) identified a transporter protein whose gene is
overexpressed in a multidrug-resistant variant of the small cell lung
cancer cell line NCI-H69. Unlike most tumor cell lines that are
resistant to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, it did not overexpress
the transmembrane transport protein P-glycoprotein (MDR1; 171050). Cole
et al. (1992) isolated cDNA clones corresponding to mRNAs overexpressed
in the resistant H69 cells. One cDNA hybridized to an mRNA of 7.8 to 8.2
kb that was expressed 100- to 200-fold higher in the resistant cells
than in the drug-sensitive H69 cells. Overexpression was associated with
amplification of the cognate gene. The cDNA contained a single open
reading frame of 1,522 amino acids encoding a protein that they
designated MRP, for 'multidrug resistance-associated protein.' (Cole and
Deeley (1993) corrected the predicted protein sequence to 1,531 amino
acids.) Database analyses demonstrated similarities in primary sequence
to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily
of transport systems. Included in this superfamily are the genes for
MDR1 and for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR; 602421). Northern blot analysis readily detected MRP transcripts
in lung, testis, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells; MRP transcripts
were below the level of detection in placenta, brain, kidney, salivary
gland, uterus, liver, and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Zaman et al. (1994) described experiments leading them to conclude that
MRP is a plasma membrane drug-efflux pump.

Lorico et al. (2002) showed that glutathione is a cofactor in
MRP-mediated resistance to heavy metal oxyanions: human fibrosarcoma
cells overexpressing MRP1 together with the heavy (catalytic) subunit of
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (606857) showed increased resistance
to sodium arsenite and antimony toxicity.

Using flow cytometric analysis, Muller et al. (2002) found that when a
FLAG epitope was introduced into the extracellular loops of
membrane-spanning domain-1 (MSD1) or MSD3 of MRP1, it was accessible on
the cell surface upon removal of N-glycosylation sites. In contrast,
FLAG epitope inserted into MSD2 was not accessible even after removal of
all 3 N-glycosylation sites, indicating that MSD2 is deeply buried in
the plasma membrane.

Using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, Pascolo et al. (2003) found that
MRP1 and MRP3 (ABCC3; 604323) were highly expressed in placenta, but
only MRP1 was highly expressed in a trophoblastic cell line. MRP2
(ABCC2; 601107) and MRP5 (ABCC5; 605251) were only weakly expressed in
placenta and the trophoblastic cell line. Third-trimester placenta
expressed more MRP1 than first-trimester placenta. MRP1 expression
increased markedly in the trophoblastic cell line upon polarization.
Pascolo et al. (2003) concluded that MRP1 expression increases with
trophoblast maturation.

In cultured mouse astrocytes, Gennuso et al. (2004) found that
unconjugated bilirubin induced increased expression and transient
redistribution of Mrp1 from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane
and throughout the cytoplasm. Blocking Mrp1 efflux pumps increased the
susceptibility of the cells to the toxic effects of unconjugated
bilirubin, suggesting that Mrp1 is an important protector in this
scenario. The authors noted the relevance of the findings to neonatal
encephalopathy caused by increased bilirubin.

Mitra et al. (2006) found that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) was
released from mast cells independently of degranulation. S1P secretion
was dependent on ABCC1, but not on ABCB1 (171050), and inhibition of
ABCC1 blocked both constitutive and antigen-stimulated S1P release.
Chemotaxis assays showed that ABCC1-mediated transport of S1P influenced
mast-cell migration, but not mast-cell degranulation.

The reactivation of latent human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection after
transplantation is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In
vivo, myeloid cells and their progenitors are an important site of HCMV
latency, whose establishment and/or maintenance require expression of
the viral transcript UL138. Weekes et al. (2013) used stable isotope
labeling by amino acids in cell culture-based mass spectrometry to
identify a dramatic UL138-mediated loss of cell surface MRP1 and the
reduction of substrate export by this transporter. Latency-associated
loss of MRP1 and accumulation of the cytotoxic drug vincristine, an MRP1
substrate, depleted virus from naturally latent CD14+ (158120) and CD34+
(142230) progenitors, all of which are in vivo sites of latency. Weekes
et al. (2013) concluded that the UL138-mediated loss of MRP1 provides a
marker for detecting latent HCMV infection and a therapeutic target for
eliminating latently infected cells before transplantation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grant et al. (1997) defined the intron/exon structure of MRP and
characterized a number of splicing variants of MRP mRNA. The gene spans
at least 200 kb. It contains 31 exons and a high proportion of class 0
introns, alternative splicing of which results in significant levels of
variant transcripts that maintain the original open reading frame of MRP
mRNA. (A class 0 splice occurs between 2 codons, e.g., ATG/ATG =
Met.Met. A class 1 splice would be ATGA/TG and a class 2 splice would be
ATGAT/G.) Analyses of the conservation of intron/exon organization and
protein primary structure suggested that the MRP-related transporters
evolved from a common ancestor shared with CFTR by fusion with 1 or more
genes encoding polytopic membrane proteins.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Cole et al. (1992) mapped the MRP1
gene to chromosome 16p13.1. Grant et al. (1997) located the MRP1 gene
close to the short arm breakpoint of the pericentric inversion
associated with the M4Eo subclass of acute myeloid leukemia and on the
telomeric side of the MYH11 gene (160745).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using PCR-SSCP analysis, Conrad et al. (2001) screened 36 Caucasian
volunteers for mutations in the coding exons of the MRP1 gene, including
the adjacent intron sequences. Among several changes found, 2 were
predicted to cause amino acid substitutions. One of these mutations,
G671V, was of special interest because it is located near the first
nucleotide-binding domain. To determine whether this mutation caused a
change in the MRP1 phenotype, a mutant MRP1 expression vector was
constructed and transfected into SV40-transformed human embryonic kidney
cells and the transport properties of the mutant protein were examined.
With the substrates studied, the mutant showed no differences in organic
anion transport activities compared to wildtype MRP1.

Wang et al. (2005) scanned for genomic signatures of recent positive
selection in MRP1 in approximately 480 individuals sampled from the
Chinese, Malay, Indian, European American, and African American
populations. The genetic profile of SNPs at this locus revealed high
haplotype diversity and weak linkage disequilibrium (LD). Despite this
weak LD, the G allele of the -260G-C SNP (dbSNP rs4148330) in the
promoter region of the MRP1 gene, which was contained within a
high-frequency haplotype, exhibited extended haplotype homozygosity
across 135 kb in European Americans. Long-range haplotype and F(st)
statistic tests showed evidence of positive selection for the G allele
in the European American population. An MRP1 promoter-reporter assay
showed significantly lower activity for the G allele-containing promoter
when compared with the C allele-containing promoter in all 4 cell lines
tested (P = less than 0.01). Wang et al. (2005) suggested that dbSNP
rs4148330 may account, in part, for interindividual variations and
population differences in drug response.

ANIMAL MODEL

Robbiani et al. (2000) showed that migration of dendritic cells (DCs)
from skin to lymph nodes utilizes the leukotriene C4 (LTC4; see 246530)
transporter MRP1. DC mobilization from the epidermis and trafficking
into lymphatic vessels was greatly reduced in Mrp1 -/- mice, but
migration was restored by exogenous cysteinyl leukotrienes LTC4 or LTD4.
In vitro, these cysteinyl leukotrienes promoted optimal chemotaxis to
the chemokine CCL19 (SCYA19; 602227) but not to other related
chemokines. Antagonism of CCL19 in vivo prevented DC migration out of
the epidermis. Thus, the authors concluded that MRP1 regulates DC
migration to lymph nodes, apparently by transporting LTC4, which in turn
promotes chemotaxis to CCL19 and mobilization of DCs from the epidermis.

Schultz et al. (2001) showed that Mrp1-deficient mice had diminished
outgrowth of Streptococcus pneumoniae and strongly reduced mortality
compared with wildtype mice after intranasal infection. This advantage
could be abrogated by treatment with a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Mutant
mice had low levels of LTC4 in lung because of accumulation of
intracellular LTC4 and inhibition of LTC4 synthase. On the other hand,
they had a reduced inflammatory response and high levels of LTB4 (see
LTB4R2; 605773), which was associated with increased LTA4 hydrolase
(151570) activity and was required for the protective effect. Schultz et
al. (2001) suggested that MRP1 may be a novel target for adjunctive
therapy in pneumonia.

Lorico et al. (2002) found resistance to heavy metal oxyanion toxicity
in cell cultures overexpressing MRP1, but no increase in sensitivity to
sodium arsenite and antimony in Mrp1 -/- knockout mice. The authors
stated that the redundancy of transmembrane export pumps suggests that
other pump(s) may effectively vicariate for MRP1-mediated transport of
heavy metal oxyanions.

602559	TITLE *602559 EXPORTIN 1; XPO1
;;REQUIRED FOR CHROMOSOME REGION MAINTENANCE; CRM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human CRM1, or XPO1, is the homolog of yeast crm1 (named for 'required
for chromosome region maintenance'), a nuclear protein essential for
proliferation and chromosome region maintenance. Fornerod et al. (1997)
used the oncogenic nucleoporin CAN (114350) to coprecipitate human CRM1.
The complete cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 1,071 amino acids with
a predicted molecular mass of 123 kD. The CRM1 protein migrates at 112
kD. Human CRM1 has 47% identity with S. cerevisiae crm1 and 52% identity
with S. pombe crm1+. The N terminus of human CRM1 shares significant
homology with the N terminus of importin-beta. Fornerod et al. (1997)
identified a group of largely uncharacterized yeast and vertebrate
proteins of similar size (110 to 120 kD) that share this homology
domain, which they proposed to call the CRIME domain (for 'CRM1,
importin-beta, etc.').

Kudo et al. (1997) cloned human CRM1 cDNA using sequence information
from EST databases and a PCR-based strategy based on the sequence of S.
pombe crm1+. Northern blot analysis using the C-terminal region of human
CRM1 cDNA as a probe revealed a major transcript of 5.6 kb expressed in
all tissues tested except kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Kudo et al. (1997) found that Human CRM1 weakly complemented the
cold-sensitive mutation of S. pombe crm1-809. Overproduction of human
CRM1 suppressed cell proliferation in wildtype S. pombe in an expression
level-dependent manner. Overexpression of native S. pombe crm1+ had the
same effect. Northern blot analysis with RNAs isolated from synchronized
mammalian cells showed that the expression of mammalian CRM1 was
initiated in the late G1 phase and reached a peak at G2/M, although the
protein level did not change during the cell cycle. Human CRM1 fused to
green fluorescent protein (GFP) and transiently expressed in NIH 3T3
cells showed that human CRM1 was localized preferentially in the nuclear
envelope, but was also detectable in the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.
A crm1 mutation of S. pombe caused nuclear import of a GFP fusion
protein containing a nuclear export signal (NES) but no change in the
distribution of a GFP fusion protein containing a nuclear localization
signal (NLS). These data suggested to Kudo et al. (1997) that CRM1 is a
novel cell cycle-regulated gene that is essential for the NES-dependent
nuclear export of proteins.

CRM1 protein binds CAN and NUP88 (602552), and its association with the
nuclear pore is dynamic (Fornerod et al., 1997). To test whether CRM1
could be a nuclear export receptor, Fornerod et al. (1997) used Xenopus
oocytes incubated in leptomycin B, a cytotoxin which blocks Rev export
and Rev-mediated RNA export in tissue culture cells. Leptomycin B
interacted directly with CRM1, as shown by gel shift assays, and blocked
export of Rev and U snRNAs from Xenopus oocyte nucleus. Overexpression
of CRM1 stimulated Rev and U snRNA export from the nucleus. Fornerod et
al. (1997) found that an NES/CRM1/Ran complex forms in the presence of
RanGTP. Leptomycin B blocks formation of this complex. Fornerod et al.
(1997) concluded that CRM1 is an export receptor for leucine-rich NESs.
Noting that CRM1 is a member of a family of proteins related to
importin-beta, Fornerod et al. (1997) suggested the descriptive name
'exportins' for those family members involved in nuclear export.

Stade et al. (1997) characterized CRM1 as an essential nuclear export
factor in S. cerevisiae and proposed that CRM1 be renamed 'exportin-1,'
symbolized XPO1. XPO1 protein is localized in the nucleus at steady
state but is capable of shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm.
Stade et al. (1997) constructed an NES-GFP-NLS substrate which shuttled
continuously between the nucleus and cytoplasm, but appeared largely
cytoplasmic, presumably due to a higher rate of export. In yeast
containing a temperature-sensitive mutation in CRM1, the substrate
became nuclear within 5 minutes at high temperature, indicating that the
mutation blocks NES export. High temperature also blocked mRNA export in
yeast. A 2-hybrid analysis showed an interaction between NES and CRM1
and between Ran and CRM1.

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) is
degraded during the cell cycle by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
Using NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Kamura
et al. (2004) found that a complex made up of Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472) and
Kpc2 (UBAC1; 608129) ubiquitinated cytoplasmic p27(KIP1) at G1 phase and
that cytoplasmic degradation of p27(KIP1) required p27(KIP1) nuclear
export by Crm1.

A single transcript in its unspliced and spliced forms directs synthesis
of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 proteins. Although nuclear
export of intron-containing cellular transcripts is restricted in
mammalian cells, HIV-1 has evolved the viral Rev protein to overcome
this restriction for viral transcripts. CRM1 is a cellular cofactor for
Rev-dependent export of intron-containing HIV-1 RNA. Yedavalli et al.
(2004) presented evidence that Rev/CRM1 activity uses the ATP-dependent
RNA helicase DDX3 (300160). They showed that DDX3 is a nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling protein that binds CRM1 and localizes to nuclear membrane
pores. Knockdown of DDX3 using either antisense vector or
dominant-negative mutants suppressed Rev-RRE (Rev response element)
function in the export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 RNAs. Yedavalli et
al. (2004) concluded that DDX3 is the human RNA helicase that functions
in the CRM1 RNA export pathway analogously to the postulated role for
Dbp5 (605812) in yeast mRNA export.

For a review of nuclear export receptors, see Ullman et al. (1997).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Dong et al. (2009) presented a 2.9-angstrom resolution crystal structure
of CRM1 bound to snurportin (SNUPN1; 607902). Snurportin-1 binds CRM1 in
a bipartite manner by means of an N-terminal leucine-rich nuclear export
signal (LR-NES) and its nucleotide-binding domain. The LR-NES is a
combined alpha-helical-extended structure that occupies a hydrophobic
groove between 2 CRM1 outer helices. The LR-NES interface explains the
consensus hydrophobic pattern, preference for intervening
electronegative residues, and inhibition by leptomycin B. The second
nuclear export signal epitope is a basic surface on the snurportin-1
nucleotide-binding domain, which binds an acidic patch on CRM1 adjacent
to the LR-NES site. Multipartite recognition of individually weak
nuclear export signal epitopes may be common to CRM1 substrates,
enhancing CRM1 binding beyond the generally low affinity LR-NES. Similar
energetic construction is also used in multipartite nuclear localization
signals to provide broad substrate specificity and rapid evolution in
nuclear transport.

Monecke et al. (2009) presented the crystal structure of the
SPN1-CRM1-RanGTP (see 601179) export complex at 2.5-angstrom resolution.
SPN1 is a nuclear import adapter for cytoplasmically assembled, m3G
(5-prime-2,2,7-terminal trimethylguanosine)-capped spliceosomal U
snRNPs. The structure showed how CRM1 can specifically return the
cargo-free form of SPN1 to the cytoplasm. The extensive contact area
includes 5 hydrophobic residues at the SPN1 amino terminus that dock
into a hydrophobic cleft of CRM1, as well as numerous hydrophilic
contacts of CRM1 to m3G cap-binding domain and carboxyl-terminal
residues of SPN1. Monecke et al. (2009) concluded that RanGTP promotes
cargo binding to CRM1 solely through long-range conformational changes
in the exportin.

MAPPING

The CRM1 gene maps to human chromosome 2p16 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (Fornerod et al., 1997).

614277	TITLE *614277 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME 2W; UBE2W
;;UBC16, ARABIDOPSIS, HOMOLOG OF; UBC16
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitination is a common posttranslational modification that plays
roles in many cellular pathways and in protein degradation. Conjugation
of ubiquitin to substrate proteins requires an E1 ubiquitin-activating
enzyme (e.g., UBE1; 314370), an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e.g.,
UBE2A; 312180), and an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (e.g., UBE3A;
601623). UBE2W is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (summary by Zhang
et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a human fetal brain cDNA library, Yin
et al. (2006) cloned UBE2W, which they called UBC16. The deduced
162-amino acid protein has an approximately 150-amino acid catalytic
core, termed the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) domain, which
contains 2 nuclear localization signals at its C-terminal end. Human
UBC16 shares 51% amino acid identity with Arabidopsis Ubc16. RT-PCR
detected ubiquitous UBC16 expression, with highest expression in heart,
brain, liver, and pancreas. Fluorescence-tagged UBC16 localized to
nuclei of transfected HEK293 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation analysis, Yin et al. (2006) showed that nuclear localization
of human UBC in transfected HEK293 cells required both the nuclear
localization signals and enzyme activity.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2011) showed that mouse
Ube2w interacted with Fancl (608111), an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in
DNA damage repair. They confirmed the interaction by protein pull-down
and coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Fancl showed a ubiquitous
intracellular localization in the absence of Ube2w and a nuclear
localization in the presence of Ube2w. Ube2w formed nuclear homodimers.
Ube2w exhibited ubiquitin-conjugating activity and monoubiquitinated the
PHD domain of Fancl in vitro. Ubiquitination by Ube2w required a
conserved active-site cysteine within its ubiquitin-conjugating domain.
Ube2w also monoubiquitinated Fancd2 (613984). Downregulation of UBE2W in
human cell lines markedly reduced FANCD2 monoubiquitination caused by
ultraviolet irradiation, but not FANCD2 monoubiquitination caused by the
DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C or FANCD2 monoubiquitination that
occurs normally during S phase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yin et al. (2006) determined that the UBE2W gene contains 7 exons and
spans 8.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yin et al. (2006) mapped the UBE2W gene to
chromosome 8q13-q21.1.

;;HPAII TINY FRAGMENTS LOCUS 9C; HTF9C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) cloned mouse Htf9c, which encodes a deduced
676-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 75 kD. Htf9c
has a putative N-terminal nuclear targeting signal and a C-terminal
domain similar to yeast and bacterial nucleic acid-modifying enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) found that mouse Htf9c and Ranbp1 (601180)
were divergently transcribed from a bidirectional promoter. Expression
of both genes was activated upon entry into the cell cycle, peaked in S
phase, and was downregulated during completion of the cell cycle. The
bidirectional promoter was downregulated in both orientations in
arrested cells. Activation of the promoter was specific, resulting in
more restricted Htf9c expression and a sharper peak of Htf9c expression
in S phase compared with Ranbp1 expression. A region containing an E2f
(189971) site was important for cell cycle control of Htf9c, and a
common region containing sites for Sp1 (189906) and E2f contributed to
activation in both orientations.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the HTF9C gene to chromosome 22q11.21 based on an
alignment of the TRMT2A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025106) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

614405	TITLE *614405 DEAH BOX POLYPEPTIDE 33; DHX33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the DEAD/DEAH box family of RNA helicases, such as DHX33,
modify the higher-order structure of RNA through hydrolysis of ATP or
other nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). These enzymes have a role in RNA
transcription, RNA editing, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and
RNA decay (summary by Zhang et al., 2011).

CLONING

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed by RNA polymerase I (see POLR1B;
602000) as a 47S polycistronic precursor that is processed into mature
18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs. Using an RNA interference screen to identify
DDX/DHX enzymes that perturb rRNA transcription in human fibroblasts,
Zhang et al. (2011) identified DHX33. The deduced protein contains an
N-terminal ATP/NTP-binding domain, a central ATP/NTPase domain, and
C-terminal helicase and ATP/NTP hydrolysis-dependent substrate
interaction motifs. Fractionation of a human breast cancer cell line and
human and mouse fibroblasts, as well as immunohistochemical analysis,
revealed that DHX33 localized predominantly with markers of nucleoli,
with some localization in nucleoplasm. Following dispersal of nucleoli
during the cell cycle, DHX33 followed nucleolar proteins to nucleolar
organizing regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2011) found that knockdown of DHX33 in human cell lines
inhibited rRNA transcription and processing, reduced the size of
nucleoli, caused nucleolar stress, and initiated a p53 (TP53;
191170)-dependent stress response that included cell cycle arrest and
induction of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899). Mutation analysis revealed that lys94
(K94) within the catalytic domain of DHX33 was crucial for rRNA
transcription. DHX33 deficiency reduced recruitment of the large RNA
polymerase subunit RPA194 (POLR1A) to rDNA loci and reduced
phosphorylation of UBF (UBTF; 600673), which is required for RNA
polymerase I activity. Overexpression of wildtype DHX33, but not DHX33
with a K94 mutation, in human cell lines stimulated 47S synthesis.
Overexpression of DHX33 with deletion of its putative DNA-binding domain
also reduced rRNA synthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of
human breast cancer cells revealed that DHX33, like RPA194, occupied the
entire rDNA promoter and transcribed regions, and binding required the
DNA-binding motif of DHX33. DHX33 also immunoprecipitated with UBF.
Zhang et al. (2011) concluded that DHX33 has a critical role in cell
growth and rRNA synthesis.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DHX33 gene to chromosome 17p13.2 based on an
alignment of the DHX33 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL359945) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

606767	TITLE *606767 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, SUBFAMILY G, MEMBER 3; KCNG3
;;KV6.3;;
KV10.1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-gated potassium channels play an essential role in controlling
cellular excitability in the nervous system. These channels are
multimeric proteins containing alpha subunits, which are directly
responsible for channel activity, and gamma subunits, which modify the
basic channel activity. Kv6.3 functions as a gamma subunit.

CLONING

Using primers derived from a genomic fragment showing homology to Kv6.2
(605696), Sano et al. (2002) cloned Kv6.3 from a human brain cDNA
library. Kv6.3 encodes a deduced 437-amino acid sequence with a
predicted molecular mass of 49 kD. It shares 34% sequence identity with
Kv6.2 and 95.1% identity with the rat ortholog, Kv6.3. The protein
contains a pore forming domain and 6 transmembrane domains. RT-PCR
analysis demonstrated high expression of human Kv6.3 in various regions
of the brain. RT-PCR analysis in rat demonstrated that Kv6.3 is
specifically expressed in neuronal cells.

By PCR, Ottschytsch et al. (2002) cloned KCNG3, which they called
Kv10.1, from a brain cDNA library. The deduced protein contains 436
amino acids. PCR analysis detected strongest expression in pancreas and
testis and lower levels in brain, lung, kidney, thymus, ovary, small
intestine, and colon.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation studies, Sano et al. (2002) demonstrated
interaction between Kv6.3 and Kv2.1 (600397) in cotransfected COS-7
cells. Electrophysiologic analysis of transiently transfected murine
fibroblasts showed that Kv6.3 does not form a functional voltage-gated
ion channel when expressed alone. When Kv6.3 is coexpressed with Kv2.1,
a heteromultimeric channel is formed that shows a decreased rate of
deactivation compared to the channel formed by Kv2.1 alone. Thus, Kv6.3
appears to function as a modulatory subunit.

Ottschytsch et al. (2002) found no potassium currents when KCNG3 was
expressed alone, while coexpression with Kv2.1 in mouse fibroblasts
resulted in altered Kv2.1 channel properties. By yeast 2-hybrid analysis
using the N-terminal segment of KCNG3 containing the NAB domain, which
regulates coassembly, Ottschytsch et al. (2002) found no
homotetramerization between KCNG3 molecules. Immunoprecipitation
analysis using full-length proteins confirmed interaction between KCNG3
and Kv2.1. By confocal microscopy, Ottschytsch et al. (2002) showed that
KCNG3 was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when expressed alone,
and it redistributed to the plasma membrane when expressed with Kv2.1.
Ottschytsch et al. (2002) concluded that Kv2.1 promotes the trafficking
of KCNG3 and other regulatory subunits to the cell surface, presumably
by forming heterotetrameric channels.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sano et al. (2002) determined that the Kv6.3 gene contains 2 exons
spanning 49 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Sano et al. (2002) mapped the Kv6.3 gene within a genomic clone
localized to chromosome 2. By genomic sequence analysis, Ottschytsch et
al. (2002) mapped the KCNG3 gene to chromosome 2p21.

CLONING

Varon et al. (1998) described the positional cloning of a gene encoding
a novel protein, termed nibrin, that mapped within a 300-kb critical
region for Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS; 251260) on chromosome 8q21.
Northern blot analysis revealed mRNA transcripts of 2.4 and 4.4 kb in
all tissues examined. The predicted 754-amino acid protein contains 2
domains found in cell cycle checkpoint proteins, a forkhead-associated
domain and an adjacent breast cancer carboxy-terminal domain.

Carney et al. (1998) independently isolated the gene for NBS. They
characterized the gene encoding p95, a member of the MRE11/RAD50
double-strand break (DSB) repair complex. Comparison of the p95 cDNA to
the NBS1 cDNA of Varon et al. (1998) indicated that the p95 and NBS1
genes are identical.

Matsuura et al. (1998) reported the positional cloning of the gene
responsible for the Nijmegen breakage syndrome, NBS1, from an 800-kb
candidate region. They found that the gene is expressed at high levels
in testis, suggesting that it may be involved in meiotic recombination.

GENE FUNCTION

The MRE11/RAD50 DSB repair complex consists of 5 proteins: p95 (NBS1),
p200, p400, MRE11, and RAD50 (604040). Carney et al. (1998) found that
p95 was absent from NBS cells established from NBS patients and that p95
deficiency in these cells completely abrogated the formation of
MRE11/RAD50 ionizing radiation-induced foci. The implication of the
MRE11/RAD50/p95 protein complex in NBS reveals a direct molecular link
between DSB repair and cell cycle checkpoint functions.

Zhong et al. (1999) demonstrated association of BRCA1 (113705) with the
RAD50/MRE11/p95 complex. Upon irradiation, BRCA1 was detected in the
nucleus, in discrete foci which colocalize with RAD50. Formation of
irradiation-induced foci positive for BRCA1, RAD50, MRE11, or p95 was
dramatically reduced in HCC/1937 breast cancer cells carrying a
homozygous mutation in BRCA1 but was restored by transfection of
wildtype BRCA1. Ectopic expression of wildtype, but not mutated, BRCA1
in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the DNA damage agent
methyl methanesulfonate. These data suggested to the authors that BRCA1
is important for the cellular responses to DNA damage that are mediated
by the RAD50-MRE11-p95 complex.

Wang et al. (2000) used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry
analyses to identify BRCA1-associated proteins. They found that BRCA1 is
part of a large multisubunit protein complex of tumor suppressors, DNA
damage sensors, and signal transducers. They named this complex BASC,
for 'BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex.' Among the DNA repair
proteins identified in the complex were ATM (607585), BLM (604610), MSH2
(609309), MSH6 (600678), MLH1 (120436), the RAD50-MRE11-NBS1 complex,
and the RFC1 (102579)-RFC2 (600404)-RFC4 (102577) complex. Confocal
microscopy demonstrated that BRCA1, BLM, and the RAD50-MRE11-NBS1
complex colocalize to large nuclear foci. Wang et al. (2000) suggested
that BASC may serve as a sensor of abnormal DNA structures and/or as a
regulator of the postreplication repair process.

Because of the similarities between ataxia-telangiectasia (AT; 208900)
and Nijmegen breakage syndrome, Lim et al. (2000) evaluated the
functional interactions between the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM;
607585) and NBS1 genes. Activation of the ATM kinase by ionizing
radiation and induction of ATM-dependent responses in NBS cells
indicated that NBS1 may not be required for signaling to ATM after
ionizing radiation. However, NBS1 was phosphorylated on serine-343 in an
ATM-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo after ionizing radiation. An
NBS1 construct mutated at the ATM phosphorylation site abrogated an
S-phase checkpoint induced by ionizing radiation in normal cells and
failed to compensate for this functional deficiency in NBS cells. These
observations linked ATM and NBS1 in a common signaling pathway and
provided an explanation for the phenotypic similarities between the 2
disorders.

Gatei et al. (2000) demonstrated that nibrin is phosphorylated within 1
hour of treatment of cells with ionizing radiation. This response was
abrogated in AT cells that either do not express ATM protein or express
near full-length mutant protein. Gatei et al. (2000) also showed that
ATM physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine-343
both in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation of this site appears to be
functionally important because mutated nibrin (S343A) does not
completely complement radiosensitivity in NBS cells. ATM phosphorylation
of nibrin does not affect nibrin-MRE11-RAD50 association, as revealed by
radiation-induced foci formation. Gatei et al. (2000) concluded that
their data provide a biochemical explanation for the similarity in
phenotype between AT and NBS.

Zhao et al. (2000) demonstrated that phosphorylation of NBS1, induced by
ionizing radiation, requires catalytically active ATM. Complexes
containing ATM and NBS1 exist in vivo in both untreated cells and cells
treated with ionizing radiation. Zhao et al. (2000) identified 2
residues of NBS1, serine-278 and serine-343, that are phosphorylated in
vitro by ATM and whose modification in vivo is essential for the
cellular response to DNA damage. This response includes S-phase
checkpoint activation, formation of the NBS1/Mre11/Rad50 nuclear foci,
and rescue of hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Zhao et al. (2000)
concluded that together, these results demonstrated a biochemical link
between cell cycle checkpoints activated by DNA damage and DNA repair in
2 genetic diseases with overlapping phenotypes.

Zhu et al. (2000) showed by coimmunoprecipitation that a small fraction
of RAD50, MRE11, and NBS1 is associated with the telomeric
repeat-binding factor TRF2 (602027). Indirect immunofluorescence
demonstrated the presence of RAD50 and MRE11 at interphase telomeres.
NBS1 was associated with TRF2 and telomeres in S phase, but not in G1 or
G2. Although the MRE11 complex accumulated in irradiation-induced foci
(IRIFs) in response to gamma-irradiation, TRF2 did not relocate to IRIFs
and irradiation did not affect the association of TRF2 with the MRE11
complex, arguing against a role for TRF2 in double-strand break repair.
Zhu et al. (2000) proposed that the MRE11 complex functions at
telomeres, possibly by modulating t-loop formation.

Lombard and Guarente (2000) showed that p95 and MRE11 are specifically
present on telomeres during meiosis. They suggested that p95 and MRE11
may have a role in telomere maintenance in mammals, analogous to the
role their homologs play in yeast.

Wu et al. (2000) reported that NBS is specifically phosphorylated in
response to gamma-radiation, ultraviolet light, and exposure to
hydroxyurea. Phosphorylation of NBS mediated by gamma-radiation, but not
that induced by hydroxyurea or ultraviolet light, was markedly reduced
in ATM cells. In vivo, NBS was phosphorylated on many serine residues,
of which serine-343, serine-397, and serine-615 were phosphorylated by
ATM in vitro. At least 2 of these sites were underphosphorylated in ATM
cells. Inactivation of these serines by mutation partially abrogated
ATM-dependent phosphorylation. Reconstituting NBS cells with a mutant
form of NBS that cannot be phosphorylated at selected ATM-dependent
serine residues led to a specific reduction in clonogenic survival after
gamma-radiation. Wu et al. (2000) concluded that phosphorylation of NBS
by ATM is critical for certain responses of human cells to DNA damage.

Wilda et al. (2000) studied the expression of Nbs1 in mouse embryos at
different developmental stages as well as in adult mice. Although a low
level of expression was observed in all tissues, highly specific
expression was observed in organs with physiologic DNA double-strand
breakage (DSB), such as testis, thymus, and spleen. Enhanced expression
was also found at sites of high proliferative activity: the
subventricular layer of the telencephalon and diencephalon, the liver,
lung, kidney, and gut, as well as striated and smooth muscle cells in
various organs. In the adult cerebellum, the postmitotic Purkinje cells
were marked specifically. The authors hypothesized that in addition to
the role of the Nbs1 gene product as part of a DNA DSB repair complex,
the Nbs1 gene product may serve further functions during development.

Chen et al. (2000) reported that the NBS1 protein and histone gamma-H2AX
(601772), which associate with irradiation-induced DNA DSBs, are also
found at sites of V(D)J (variable, diversity, joining)
recombination-induced DSBs. In developing thymocytes, NBS1 and
gamma-H2AX form nuclear foci that colocalize with the T-cell
receptor-alpha (TCRA; see 186880) locus in response to
recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG1; 179615) protein-mediated V(D)J
cleavage. Chen et al. (2000) concluded that their results suggest that
surveillance of T-cell receptor recombination intermediates by NBS1 and
gamma-H2AX may be important for preventing oncogenic translocations.

Class switch recombination (CSR) is a region-specific DNA recombination
reaction that replaces one immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant region
gene with another. This enables a single variable region gene to be used
in conjunction with different downstream heavy-chain genes, each having
a unique biologic activity. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID;
605257), a putative RNA editing enzyme, is required for this action.
Petersen et al. (2001) reported that the Nijmegen breakage syndrome
protein and gamma-H2AX, which facilitate DNA double-strand break repair,
form nuclear foci at the heavy-chain constant region in the G1 phase of
the cell cycle in cells undergoing class switch recombination. Class
switch recombination is impaired in H2AX -/- mice. Localization of NBS1
and gamma-H2AX to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus during class
switch recombination is dependent on AID. In addition, AID is required
for induction of switch region-specific DNA lesions that precede class
switch recombination. Petersen et al. (2001) concluded that AID
functions upstream of the DNA modifications that initiate class switch
recombination.

Falck et al. (2002) demonstrated that experimental blockade of either
the NBS1-MRE11 function or the CHK2 (604373)-triggered events leads to a
partial radioresistant DNA synthesis phenotype in human cells. In
contrast, concomitant interference with NBS1-MRE11 and the CHK2-CDC25A
(116947)-CDK2 (116953) pathways entirely abolishes inhibition of DNA
synthesis induced by ionizing radiation, resulting in complete
radioresistant DNA synthesis analogous to that caused by defective ATM.
In addition, CDK2-dependent loading of CDC45 (603465) onto replication
origins, a prerequisite for recruitment of DNA polymerase, was prevented
upon irradiation of normal or NBS1/MRE11-defective cells but not cells
with defective ATM. Falck et al. (2002) concluded that in response to
ionizing radiation, phosphorylation of NBS1 and CHK2 by ATM triggers 2
parallel branches of the DNA damage-dependent S-phase checkpoint that
cooperate by inhibiting distinct steps of DNA replication.

In mammalian cells, a conserved multiprotein complex of MRE11, RAD50,
and NBS1 (MRN) is important for double-strand break repair, meiotic
recombination, and telomere maintenance. In the absence of the early
region E4, the double-stranded genome of adenoviruses is joined into
concatemers too large to be packaged. Stracker et al. (2002)
investigated the cellular proteins involved in the concatamer formation
and how they are inactivated by E4 products during a wildtype infection.
They demonstrated that concatamerization requires functional MRE11 and
NBS1, and that these proteins are found at foci adjacent to viral
replication centers. Infection with wildtype virus results in both
reorganization and degradation of members of the MRN complex. These
activities are mediated by 3 viral oncoproteins that prevent
concatamerization. This targeting of cellular proteins involved in the
genomic stability suggested a mechanism for 'hit-and-run' transformation
observed for these viral oncoproteins.

Franchitto and Pichierri (2002) reviewed the roles of RECQL2 (604611)
and RECQL3 (604610) in resolution of a stall in DNA replication, as well
as their possible interaction with the MRN complex.

Tauchi et al. (2002) established an Nbs1 knockout cell line by using the
hyperrecombinogenic chick B-cell line DT40. Exon 4 of the 3 Nbs1 alleles
in DT40 cells was targeted. The Nbs1 -/-/- cells were still viable,
although they exhibited slow growth owing to a prolonged cell cycle
time. The disruption of Nbs1 reduced gene conversion and sister
chromatid exchanges, similar to other homologous recombination-deficient
mutants. In fact, a site-specific double-strand break repair assay
showed a notable reduction of homologous recombination events following
generation of such breaks in Nbs1-disrupted cells. The rare
recombinations observed in the Nbs1-disrupted cells were frequently
found to have aberrant structures, which possibly arose from unusual
crossover events, suggesting that the NBS1 complex might be required to
process recombination intermediates. Thus, Tauchi et al. (2002)
demonstrated that NBS1 is essential for homologous
recombination-mediated repair in higher vertebrate cells.

Zhong et al. (2005) tested whether the MRN complex has a global
controlling role over ATR (601215) through the study of MRN deficiencies
generated by RNA interference. The MRN complex was required for
ATR-dependent phosphorylation of SMC1A (300040), which acts within
chromatin to ensure sister chromatid cohesion and to effect several DNA
damage responses. Novel phenotypes caused by MRN deficiency that support
a functional link between this complex, ATR, and SMC1A, included
hypersensitivity to UV exposure, a defective UV responsive intra-S phase
checkpoint, and a specific pattern of genomic instability. Zhong et al.
(2005) concluded that there is a controlling role for the MRN complex
over the ATR kinase, and that downstream events under this control are
broad, including both chromatin-associated and diffuse signaling
factors.

Yuan et al. (2007) found that NBS1, the regulatory subunit of MRN, was
acetylated, and that its acetylation level was tightly regulated by
SIRT1 (604479). SIRT1 associated with the MRN complex in human cells via
binding to NBS1, and SIRT1 maintained NBS1 in a hypoacetylated state, a
requirement for ionizing radiation-induced phosphorylation of NBS1 on
ser343. Yuan et al. (2007) concluded that deacetylation of NBS1 by SIRT1
plays a key role in regulation of the DNA damage response and
maintenance of genomic stability.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

The human RAD50/MRE11)/NBS1 complex (R/M/N) has a dynamic molecular
architecture consisting of a globular DNA binding domain from which two
50-nanometer coiled coils protrude. The coiled coils are flexible and
their apices can self-associate. The flexibility of the coiled coils
allows their apices to adopt an orientation favorable for interaction.
However, this also allows interaction between the tips of the 2 coiled
coils within the same complex, which competes with and frustrates the
intercomplex interaction required for DNA tethering. Moreno-Herrero et
al. (2005) showed that the dynamic architecture of the R/M/N complex is
markedly affected by DNA binding. DNA binding by the R/M/N globular
domain leads to parallel orientation of the coiled coils; this prevents
intracomplex interactions and favors intercomplex associations needed
for DNA tethering. The R/M/N complex thus is an example of a biologic
nanomachine in which binding to its ligand, in this case DNA, affects
the functional conformation of a domain located 50 nanometers distant.

GENE STRUCTURE

Varon et al. (1998) determined that the NBS1 gene spans more than 50 kb
and contains 16 exons.

MAPPING

Varon et al. (1998) mapped the NBS1 gene to chromosome 8q21. Carney et
al. (1998) mapped the gene to chromosome 8q21.3.

By computer-assisted analysis of 5 BAC clones and an EST sequence,
Tauchi et al. (1999) defined the genomic organization of an 800-kb
region on chromosome 8q21 as 5-prime C8ORF1 (604598), 3-prime NBS1,
5-prime DECR1 (222745), and 3-prime CALB1 (114050).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Varon et al. (1998) identified a truncating 5-bp deletion (602667.0001)
in the NBS1 gene in the majority of NBS patients studied, all of whom
carried a conserved marker haplotype. Five additional truncating
mutations were identified in patients with other distinct haplotypes.
The domains found in nibrin and the NBS phenotype suggest that this
disorder is caused by defective responses to DNA double-strand breaks
(DSB).

Matsuura et al. (1998) detected the 5-bp deletion (602667.0001) in NBS1
in 13 individuals of Slavic or German origin and concluded that it is
likely to be a founder mutation.

The findings that the ataxia-telangiectasia gene is involved in the
pathogenesis of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and other forms of
leukemia, that there is a high predisposition of NBS patients to
lymphoid malignancy, and the fact that NBS and ATM are indistinguishable
at the cellular level, prompted Varon et al. (2001) to investigate
whether the NBS1 gene is involved in the pathogenesis of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and whether it influences the course of the
disease and so has its place among the tumor suppressor genes. They
analyzed samples from 47 children with first relapse of ALL for
mutations in all 16 exons of the NBS1 gene and identified 4 novel amino
acid substitutions in 7 children. Germline origin of an I171V
(602667.0007) mutation was confirmed in 3 patients, whereas another
change, D95N, was present only in leukemic cells. No additional
mutations were found on the second allele in any of these 7 patients.

Tanzarella et al. (2003) found that heterozygous individuals from 3
unrelated NBS families with distinct gene deletion mutations had
spontaneous chromosome instability (chromatid and chromosomal breaks as
well as rearrangements) in blood lymphocytes, but their lymphoblastoid
cell lines were not different from controls in x-ray G2 sensitivity.
Immunoprecipitation of nibrin detected the normal and variant proteins
in carriers from all 3 families.

Nakanishi et al. (2002) reported a patient diagnosed with Fanconi anemia
(FA; 227650) on the basis of chromosome breakage induced by mitomycin C.
The individual showed atypical FA features, including features of NBS.
The clinical syndrome was severe, and the child died at 3 years of age,
similar to an affected cousin. Immunoblot analysis of primary
lymphocytes indicated expression of both unubiquitinated and
monoubiquitinated isoforms of FANCD2 (227646); however, no NBS1 protein
was expressed. Sequence analysis indicated that the patient cells
contained a tyr363-to-ter mutation in NBS1 (602667.0008), which resulted
in a truncated protein. Genomic sequence analysis showed that the
mutation was homozygous. By coimmunoprecipitation, Nakanishi et al.
(2002) found constitutive interaction between FANCD2 and NBS1, and they
presented evidence that these proteins interact in 2 distinct assemblies
to mediate S-phase checkpoint and resistance to mitomycin C-induced
chromosome damage. NBS1, ATM, and MRE11 were required for FANCD2
phosphorylation in response to radiation-induced S-phase checkpoint. The
assembly of NBS1, MRE11, RAD50, and FANCD2 within nuclear foci was
required for mitomycin C resistance.

Plisiecka-Halasa et al. (2002) looked for NBS1 gene alterations and
changes in nibrin expression in 162 human gynecologic tumors, mostly
ovarian. They identified the so-called Slavic mutation, 657del5
(602667.0001), in 2 of 117 carcinomas studied (1.7%). In both cases it
was present in the germline, and in 1 of these tumors there was loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) for the 657del5 mutation and loss of nibrin
expression.

In monozygotic twin brothers with a severe form of NBS, Seemanova et al.
(2006) identified compound heterozygosity for the 657del5 mutation and a
missense mutation (602667.0009) in the NBS1 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhu et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in NBS1 by targeted
disruption. Nbs1 -/- mice suffered early embryonic lethality and had
poorly developed embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Blastocysts
showed greatly diminished expansion of the inner cell mass in culture,
suggesting that NBS1 mediates essential functions during proliferation
in the absence of externally induced damage. Zhu et al. (2001) concluded
that the complex phenotypes observed in NBS patients and cell lines may
not result from a complete inactivation of NBS1 but may instead result
from hypomorphic truncation mutations compatible with cell viability.

Demuth et al. (2004) used the Cre/loxP system to generate mice with an
inducible Nbs1-null mutation, allowing examination of DNA repair and
cell cycle checkpoints in the complete absence of nibrin. Induction of
the null mutation led to loss of the G2/M checkpoint, increased
chromosome damage, radiomimetic sensitivity, and cell death. In vivo,
lymphatic tissues, bone marrow, thymus, and spleen showed a dramatic
decrease in cell survival, whereas liver, kidney, and muscle showed no
effect on cell survival. In vitro, Nbs1-null murine fibroblasts could be
rescued from cell death by transfer of human NBS1 cDNA and, more
significantly, by a cDNA carrying the 5-bp deletion. Demuth et al.
(2004) concluded that the common human 5-bp deletion is hypomorphic and
that expression of a truncated protein may be sufficient to restore
nibrin's vital cellular functions.

Frappart et al. (2005) developed mice with Nbs1 inactivation targeted to
the central nervous system. Nbs1-deleted mice were viable and appeared
normal at birth, but growth retardation was evident by postnatal day 7,
and mutants were half the weight of control mice at weaning. All
Nbs1-deleted mice showed balance disorders, tremors, altered gait,
repetitive movements, and akinesis after postnatal day 7. Macroscopic
examination of brains from mutant mice showed reduced cerebella lacking
foliation. Histologic analysis indicated that Nbs1 loss caused
proliferation arrest of granule cell progenitors and apoptosis of
postmitotic cerebellar neurons. Nbs1-deficient neuroprogenitors showed
proliferation defects in culture, but no increase in apoptosis. They
also contained more chromosomal breaks, which were accompanied by Atm
(607585)-mediated p53 (TP53; 191170) activation. Depletion of p53
substantially rescued the neurologic defects of Nbs1 mutant mice.

Stracker et al. (2007) derived Nbs1 delta-C/delta-C mice in which the
C-terminal ATM interaction domain was deleted. Nbs1 delta-C/delta-C
cells exhibited intra-S-phase checkpoint defects, but were otherwise
indistinguishable from wildtype cells with respect to other checkpoint
functions, ionizing radiation sensitivity, and chromosome stability.
However, multiple tissues of Nbs1 delta-C/delta-C mice showed a severe
apoptotic defect, comparable to that of Atm- or Chk2 (604373)-deficient
animals. Analysis of p53 transcriptional targets and Atm substrates
showed that, in contrast to the phenotype of Chk2 -/- mice, Nbs1-deltaC
does not impair the induction of proapoptotic genes. Stracker et al.
(2007) concluded that instead, the defects observed in Nbs1
delta-C/delta-C mice resulted from impaired phosphorylation at ATM
targets including SMC1 (see 300040) and the proapoptotic factor BID
(601997).

Saidi et al. (2010) found that deletion of Nbs1 in T-cell precursors in
mice resulted in severe lymphopenia and hindered the transition of
double-negative-3 (DN3) thymocytes to DN4 due to abnormal Tcrb (see
186930) coding and signal joints, as well as the functions of Nbs1 in
T-cell expansion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of TCR loci
revealed that Nbs1 depletion compromised the loading of Mre11/Rad50 to
V(D)J-generated DNA DSBs and thereby affected resection of DNA termini
and chromatin conformation of the postcleavage complex. The DN3-to-DN4
transition in the mutant mice, but not T-cell loss, could be relieved by
p53 deficiency. Ectopic Tcra/Tcrb expression also failed to rescue
T-cell lymphopenia in the mutant mice. Saidi et al. (2010) concluded
that NBS1 functions in both repair of V(D)J-generated DSBs and in
proliferation and that both functions are essential for T-cell
development.

NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
OVARIAN CANCER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
NBN, 5-BP DEL, NT657

In patients of Slavic origin with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (251260),
Varon et al. (1998) identified a common deletion of 5 nucleotides in
exon 6 of the NBS1 gene (657del5), resulting in a frameshift and a
truncated protein. A total of 46 patients homozygous for this mutation
were identified. The mutation was found exclusively on a specific
'Slavic' haplotype of linked polymorphic markers.

Matsuura et al. (1998) found the same 5-bp deletion in the NBS1 gene in
13 NBS patients of Slavic or German origin. Twelve patients were
homozygous for the deletion and 1 was heterozygous. The deletion
introduced a premature termination signal at codon 218, which was
predicted to result in a severely truncated polypeptide. Matsuura et al.
(1998) concluded that they had identified the gene involved in NBS
because complementation was effected by a YAC that contained the gene
and because no (or extremely reduced) expression of the gene was found
in a patient without the deletion but with the NBS phenotype. The
presence of a founder mutation in 13 of 14 cases, with no demonstration
of the deletion in 50 normal individuals of the same ethnic origin or in
7 normal chromosomes from NBS parents, supported this conclusion.

The truncating 657del5 had been identified in 90% of NBS patients. NBS
shares a number of features with ataxia-telangiectasia (208900), the
most notable being high sensitivity to ionizing radiation and
predisposition to cancer. Patients who are heterozygous for the ATM
mutation are predisposed to breast cancer. Since the NBS phenotype at
the cellular level is very similar to that of ataxia-telangiectasia,
Carlomagno et al. (1999) screened 477 German breast cancer patients,
aged under 51 years, and 866 matched controls for the common NBS
mutation. They identified 1 carrier among the cases and 1 among the
controls, indicating that the population frequency of this NBS mutation
is 1 in 866 persons (95% CI = 1 in 34,376 to 1 in 156) and the estimated
prevalence of NBS is thus 1 in 3 million persons. The proportion of
breast cancer attributable to this mutation is less than 1%.

Kleier et al. (2000) reported a 5-year-old Bosnian boy with severe
microcephaly. Because of multiple structural aberrations involving
chromosomes 7 and 14 typical for ataxia-telangiectasia, that disorder
was diagnosed. However, the diagnosis of NBS was suggested by the boy's
remarkable microcephaly, his facial appearance, and the absence of
ataxia and telangiectasia. DNA analysis demonstrated homozygosity for
the major mutation in the NBS1 gene, 657del5.

Maser et al. (2001) tested the hypothesis that the NBS1 657del5 mutation
was a hypomorphic defect. They showed that NBS cells harboring the
657del5 mutation contained a predicted 26-kD N-terminal protein,
NBS1(p26), and a 70-kD NBS1 protein, NBS1(p70), lacking the native N
terminus. The 26-kD protein is not physically associated with the MRE11
complex (600814), whereas the 70-kD species is physically associated
with it. NBS1(p70) is produced by internal translation initiation within
the NBS mRNA using an open reading frame generated by the 657del5
frameshift. Maser et al. (2001) proposed that the common NBS1 allele
encodes a partially functional protein that diminishes the severity of
the NBS phenotype.

Tekin et al. (2002) reported a consanguineous Turkish family whose first
son died of anal atresia and whose second son, the proband, presented
with severe pre- and postnatal growth retardation as well as striking
microcephaly, immunodeficiency, congenital heart disease, chromosomal
instability, and rhabdomyosarcoma in the anal region. The patient was
homozygous for the 657del5 mutation in the NBS1 gene, which is
responsible for NBS in most Slav populations. The family was the first
diagnosed with NBS in the Turkish population and was one of the most
severely affected examples of the syndrome.

Drabek et al. (2002) presented PCR with sequence specific primers as a
method for detection of the 657del5 mutation. They confirmed a high
carrier frequency in the Czech population (1 in 106 persons; 95% CI = 1
in 331 to 1 in 46).

In Russian children, Resnick et al. (2003) screened for the 657del5 NBS1
mutation in 548 controls and 68 patients with lymphoid malignancies. No
carrier of the mutation was found in the control group. The mutation was
found in heterozygous form in 2 of the 68 patients from the group of
lymphoid malignancies, 1 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (see 159555)
and 1 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (605027). Several relatives of the
patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who carried the same mutation had
cancer (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, breast cancer, gastrointestinal
cancers), suggesting that heterozygosity may predispose to malignant
disorders.

In monozygotic twin brothers with a severe form of NBS (251260) without
chromosomal instability, Seemanova et al. (2006) identified compound
heterozygosity for the 657del5 mutation and a 643C-T transition in exon
6 of the NBS1 gene, resulting in an arg215-to-trp (R215W) substitution
(602667.0009). Both infants showed reduced expression of full-length
nibrin, and radiation response processes were strongly reduced in their
cells. Their mother and father were heterozygous for the 657del5
mutation and the R215W mutation, respectively, as were their respective
grandfathers.

In a 3-month-old boy with NBS, Varon et al. (2007) identified
homozygosity for the 657del5 mutation; the patient's mother carried the
mutation, whereas his father was homozygous for the wildtype allele.
Analysis of 27 microsatellite markers covering all of chromosome 8
revealed that the patient had a homozygous haplotype for all of the
markers, whereas the mother carried the same haplotype in heterozygous
state. The authors stated that this was the first patient with NBS due
to maternal isodisomy of chromosome 8.

Porhanova et al. (2008) reported a 52-year-old Russian woman with
ovarian cancer (see 604370) who was found to be compound heterozygous
for a mutation in the BRCA1 gene (113705.0018) and the common Slavic
657del5 mutation in the NBN gene. Investigation of the ovarian cancer
tissue showed somatic loss of heterozygosity for NBN, but retention of
heterozygosity for BRCA1. The patient did not have a particularly severe
cancer-prone phenotype, and her parents did not have cancer, although 3
sibs developed cancer as adults. Porhanova et al. (2008) commented that
haploinsufficiency of the BRCA1 gene may contribute to cancer
progression without somatic changes.

NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, 4-BP DEL, NT698

In a patient of English origin with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (251260),
Varon et al. (1998) identified a deletion of 4 nucleotides in exon 6 of
the NBS1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein.

.0003
NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, 4-BP DEL, NT835

In a patient of Italian origin with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (251260),
Varon et al. (1998) identified a deletion of 4 nucleotides in exon 7 of
the NBS1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein.

.0004
NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, 1-BP INS

In a patient of Mexican origin with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (251260),
Varon et al. (1998) identified an insertion of 1 nucleotide in exon 7 of
the NBS1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein.

.0005
NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, 1-BP DEL, 1142C

In a patient of Canadian origin with Nijmegen breakage syndrome
(251260), Varon et al. (1998) identified a deletion of 1 nucleotide in
exon 10 of the NBS1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated
protein.

.0006
NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, GLN326TER

In a patient of Dutch origin with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (251260),
Varon et al. (1998) identified a nonsense mutation, gln326 to ter, in
exon 10 of the NBS1 gene, resulting in a truncated protein.

APLASTIC ANEMIA
LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA, ACUTE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
NBN, ILE171VAL

In 3 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Varon et al. (2001)
found germline heterozygosity for an A-to-G change at nucleotide 511,
resulting in an ile171-to-val (I171V) mutation occurring in a domain of
nibrin that is probably involved in protein-protein interactions.

In an 11-year-old Japanese girl with aplastic anemia (609135) and no
features of Nijmegen breakage syndrome (251260), Shimada et al. (2004)
identified homozygosity for the I171V mutation in the NBS1 gene. Genetic
analysis of the patient and her healthy parents indicated that she
inherited the germline I171V mutation from her father and the wildtype
allele from her mother, and that the second I171V hit occurred on the
wildtype allele early in embryonic development. Cytogenetic analysis of
lymphoblastic cell lines from the patient showed a marked increase in
numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations in the absence of
clastogens, suggesting genomic instability. Shimada et al. (2004) also
screened 413 normal controls and found heterozygosity for I171V in 5
individuals, corresponding to 1.2% of the Japanese population.

.0008
NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, TYR363TER

Nakanishi et al. (2002) reported a patient diagnosed with Fanconi anemia
(FA; 227650) on the basis of chromosome breakage induced by mitomycin C.
The individual showed atypical FA features, including features of NBS
(251260). The clinical syndrome was severe, and the child died at 3
years of age, similar to an affected cousin. In this patient, Nakanishi
et al. (2002) identified a homozygous C-to-A mutation at nucleotide 1089
of the NBS1 gene, resulting in a tyr363-to-ter mutation and a truncated
protein.

.0010
NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, 2-BP INS, 742GG

In a 53-year-old woman with a mild form of Nijmegen breakage syndrome
(251260) originally reported by Maraschio et al. (1986), Varon et al.
(2006) identified a homozygous 2-bp insertion (742insGG) in exon 7 of
the NBN gene, predicted to result in premature termination. RT-PCR
analysis identified 2 transcripts in both the patient and her parents:
the expected transcript carrying the 2-bp insertion and a second
transcript with in-frame deletion of exons 6 and 7. The skipping of
exons 6 and 7 results in a 650-amino acid protein with a molecular mass
of 73 kD; it also eliminates the 742insGG mutation in exon 7. The 73-kD
(del6-del7) transcript was observed at levels 100-fold lower in controls
than in the patient and her parents, and the del6-del7 transcript was
detected as minor product in RNA from patients with the 657del5 mutation
(602667.0001). The open reading frame of the del6-del7 transcript
predicts a partially functional protein, which was confirmed by studies
in mouse cells. ESE prediction analysis suggested that 742insGG may
affect an ESE sequence, possibly resulting in decreased splicing
enhancer activity. Because the NBN transcript can only remain in-frame
if both exons 6 and 7 are deleted, the authors hypothesized that the
presence of the del6-del7 transcript results from an active mechanism in
which reestablishment of the reading frame requires elimination of the 2
exons. The patient had no immunodeficiency and had not had frequent
infections. Varon et al. (2006) concluded that the unusually mild
phenotype in this patient resulted from residual nibrin activity.

604776	TITLE *604776 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS II, DR BETA-5; HLA-DRB5
DESCRIPTION Three subregions of the human major histocompatibility (HLA) complex on
6p21.3, DP, DQ, and DR, determine class II molecules, which are
essential in the cellular recognition interactions involved in the
generation of an immune response. Several class II antigens are also
associated with disease states. The extremely high polymorphism of HLA
class II transmembrane heterodimers is due to a few hypervariable
segments present in the most external domain of their alpha and beta
chains. The alpha chain of HLA-DR is not polymorphic, whereas the beta
chain is highly so. Some changes in amino acid sequence are critical in
disease susceptibility associations as well as the ability to present
processed antigens to T cells. By screening an HLA-DR5-homozygous cell
line cDNA library with a HLA-DRB1 (142857) probe, Tieber et al. (1986)
obtained an HLA-DRB5 cDNA encoding a 266-amino acid protein, of which
the first 29 amino acids constitute a signal peptide. Sequence
comparisons with other HLA-DRB sequences revealed regions of variability
at amino acid positions 9-13, 26-38, and 67-74 in the mature protein,
all of which are in the first external domain. The average amino acid
sequence difference between HLA-DRB5 and HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB2, and
HLA-DRB4 is 13.5%.

Lang et al. (2002) examined the association of multiple sclerosis (MS;
126200) with HLA-DRB1*1501 and -DRB5*0101 polymorphisms by determining
the antigen-recognition profile of an MS patient with a
relapsing-remitting disease course. A T-cell receptor (TCR) from the
patient recognized both DRB1*1501-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP;
159430) (residues 85 to 99) and DRB5*0101-restricted Epstein-Barr virus
DNA polymerase peptide. The crystal structure of both DRB-antigen
complexes revealed a marked degree of structural equivalence at the
surface presented for TCR recognition, with 4 identical TCR-peptide
contacts. Lang et al. (2002) concluded that these similarities support
the concept of molecular mimicry (in structural terms, a similarity of
charge distribution) involving HLA molecules and suggested that these
structural details may explain the preponderance of MHC class II
associations in HLA-associated diseases. They noted the findings of
Madsen et al. (1999) with transgenic mice, which also showed that MBP(85
to 99) associated with HLA-DRB1*1501 was involved in the development of
an MS-like disease.

611191	TITLE *611191 MICRO RNA 125A; MIR125A
;;MIRN125A;;
miRNA125A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN125A, are small noncoding RNAs that
control translation of target mRNAs by binding to sites of antisense
complementarity in 3-prime UTRs (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002).

CLONING

Lagos-Quintana et al. (2002) cloned mouse miRNA125a. Mouse miRNA125a and
miRNA125b (see 610105) differ only by a central diuridine insertion and
a U-to-C change in miRNA125a. Both miRNAs are similar to the C. elegans
lin-4 small temporal RNA. Northern blot analysis detected miRNA125a
expression in all mouse brain regions examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Laneve et al. (2007) found that MIRN9 (see 611186), MIRN125A, and
MIRN125B were upregulated in a human neuroblastoma cell line by retinoic
acid. They identified the mRNA encoding t-NTRK3, a truncated isoform of
NTRK3 (191316), as a target of the 3 miRNAs. The 3-prime UTR of the
t-NTRK3 transcript has a binding site for MIRN9 and another for both
MIRN125A and MIRN125B, which share the same seed sequence. These miRNAs
repressed t-NTRK3 expression in an additive manner, and downregulation
of t-NTRK3 was critical for regulating neuroblastoma cell growth.
Consistent with their function, MIRN9, MIRN125A, and MIRN125B were
downmodulated in primary neuroblastoma tumors.

MAPPING

Duan et al. (2007) stated that the MIR125A gene maps to chromosome
19q13.41.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By searching a human SNP database, Duan et al. (2007) identified a
G-to-U SNP at nucleotide +8 (+8G-U) in the mature MIR125A sequence.
Northern blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses of transfected HEK293
cells detected the mature form of the major +8G allele of MIR125A, but
not the mature form of the minor +8U allele. The +8G-U SNP was predicted
to introduce a base-pairing mismatch, alter free energy values, and
create an enlarged RNA bulge in pri-MIR125A. In vivo analysis showed
that +8G-U blocked processing of pri-MIR125A to pre-MIR125A. Expression
of a vector containing MIR125A +8G, but not MIR125A +8U, could suppress
a MIR125A target reporter, LIN28 (611043). Duan et al. (2007) concluded
that the +8G-U SNP alters MIR125A processing and reduces
MIR125A-mediated translational suppression.

238310	TITLE *238310 AMINOMETHYLTRANSFERASE; AMT
;;GLYCINE CLEAVAGE SYSTEM T PROTEIN; GCST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The enzyme system for cleavage of glycine (glycine cleavage system; EC
2.1.2.10), which is confined to the mitochondria, is composed of 4
protein components: P protein (a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent glycine
decarboxylase; GLDC, 238300), H protein (a lipoic acid-containing
protein; GCSH, 238330), T protein (a tetrahydrofolate-requiring enzyme),
and L protein (a lipoamide dehydrogenase; DLD, 238331).

Mutations in the T, P, and H proteins have been found to cause glycine
encephalopathy (GCE; 605899).

CLONING

The T protein of the glycine cleavage system is also known as
aminomethyltransferase (AMT). Nanao et al. (1994) isolated the AMT gene
from a human placenta cosmid library. They found that the gene is about
6 kb long and contains 9 exons. They identified 2 putative
glucocorticoid-responsive elements and a putative thyroid
hormone-responsive element. By dot-blot analysis, Kure et al. (2001)
detected expression of AMT in all tissues tested except stomach and bone
marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakata et al. (2001) reported the structure and expression of the
glycine cleavage system in rat central nervous system.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nanao et al. (1994) assigned the
AMT gene to 3p21.2-p21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with glycine encephalopathy, Nanao et al. (1994) identified
mutations in the AMT gene (238310.0001-238310.0002).

Toone et al. (2000) studied 14 unrelated patients with glycine
encephalopathy and identified mutations in 4 cases. In 2 patients,
mutations were identified in the T protein: 1 patient was homozygous for
an arg320-to-his mutation (R320H; 238310.0006), and the other patient
was heterozygous for a novel glutamine-to-termination substitution at
codon 192 (238310.0007).

Applegarth and Toone (2001) reviewed the laboratory diagnosis of glycine
encephalopathy and confirmed 9 mutations in the T protein and 8
mutations in the P protein. They also reviewed the 7 cases of transient
NKH known at that time.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY269ASP

Nanao et al. (1994) found that a patient with typical glycine
encephalopathy (605899) was homozygous for a missense mutation in the
AMT gene, a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-asp substitution at
amino acid 269 (G269D).

.0002
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY47ARG

In 2 sisters with atypical glycine encephalopathy (605899), Nanao et al.
(1994) found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the T
protein gene: a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-arg substitution
at amino acid 47 (G47R) in 1 allele, and a G-to-A transition leading to
an arg-to-his substitution at amino acid 320 (R320H; 238310.0006) in the
other allele. Nanao et al. (1994) pointed out that gly269, which was
mutant in the typically severe case they studied (see 238300.0001), is
conserved in T proteins of various species, even in E. coli, whereas
gly47 and arg320, which were mutant in the atypical and milder cases,
are replaced by ala and leu, respectively, in E. coli. Thus, mutation
occurring in more conservative amino acid residues results in more
deleterious damage to the T protein and a more severe clinical
phenotype.

.0003
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, HIS42ARG

Kure et al. (1998) reported a large Israeli-Arab kindred with glycine
encephalopathy (605899). Enzymatic analysis demonstrated that T-protein
activity was deficient in the liver from 1 affected person in the
family. Mutation detection revealed a missense mutation in exon 2
resulting in an amino acid substitution from histidine to arginine at
position 42 (his42 to arg). Homozygosity for the H42R mutation was seen
in all affected members of the family.

.0004
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, 1-BP DEL, 183C

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899), Kure et al.
(1998) described a 1-bp deletion (183delC) and a missense mutation,
asp276 to his (238310.0005).

.0005
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ASP276HIS

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899) of neonatal
onset, Kure et al. (1998) found a G-to-C substitution at position 955 in
exon 7, resulting in an amino acid change from aspartate to histidine at
position 276.

.0006
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ARG320HIS

See 238310.0001 and Nanao et al. (1994).

Toone et al. (2001) screened a DNA bank from 50 patients with
enzymatically confirmed NKH and identified the arg320-to-his (R320H)
mutation in 7% of alleles.

.0007
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLN192TER

In a patient with neonatal-onset NKH (605899), Toone et al. (2000)
identified a C-to-T transition resulting in a glutamine-to-termination
codon substitution at residue 192 (Q192X). The other mutation in this
patient was not identified.

.0008
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, IVS7, G-A, -1

Toone et al. (2001) reported a novel splice site mutation at the -1
position of intron 7 of the AMT gene: G was converted to A. This
mutation was found in 3 unrelated families and was not found in any
normal controls.

138760	TITLE *138760 HYDROXYACYL GLUTATHIONE HYDROLASE; HAGH
;;GLYOXALASE II; GLO2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6), otherwise known as hydroxyacyl-glutathione
hydrolase, converts the intermediate substrate S-lactoyl-glutathione to
reduced glutathione and D-lactate (summary by Honey and Shows, 1981).

CLONING

Ridderstrom et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA coding for glyoxalase II from
human liver. The 1,011-bp sequence contains a full-length coding region
of 780 basepairs, corresponding to a 260-amino acid polypeptide. The
calculated molecular mass of the protein is 28,861 Da. They expressed
the gene in bacteria and the recombinant enzyme showed a kinetic
behavior indistinguishable from that of the native enzyme.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Honey and Shows (1981) concluded that
the gene for glyoxalase II is on chromosome 16. Mulley and Callen (1986)
confirmed the assignment of HAGH to chromosome 16 by studies of a
human-mouse hybrid panel. They found that both HAGH and phosphoglycolate
phosphatase (PGP; 172280) were present only in those cell lines
containing 16p13.

Mulley et al. (1990) assigned the HAGH locus to 16p13.3 by
electrophoretic detection of enzymes from a mouse/human somatic cell
panel, the members of which carried portions of human chromosome 16 with
precisely defined breakpoints.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Board (1980) described rare polymorphism of glyoxalase II, observed only
in a Micronesian population, in which a new variant allele had a
frequency of 0.016. In the heterozygotes, the electrophoretic pattern
was a double band, suggesting that the structure of glyoxalase II is
monomeric. The enzyme shows a high degree of polymorphism in anthropoid
primates (Board et al., 1981).

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

602123	TITLE *602123 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE II-GAMMA; CAMK2G
;;CaM KINASE II GAMMA SUBUNIT;;
CAMKG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is a
ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in
diverse effects of hormones and neurotransmitters that utilize Ca(2+) as
a second messenger. The enzyme is an oligomeric protein composed of
distinct but related subunits, alpha (114078), beta (607707), gamma, and
delta (607708), each encoded by a separate gene. Each subunit has
alternatively spliced variants.

CLONING

Breen and Ashcroft (1997) cloned and sequenced a novel CaM kinase
II-gamma cDNA from human islet cell RNA. This isoform, designated
gamma-SRP by the authors, encodes a truncated gamma CaM kinase II in
which the 3-prime end consists of 804 basepairs of the human SRP72 gene
(602122).

Tombes and Krystal (1997) identified a number of CAMKG variants
expressed by neuronal cells. Two variants were consistently expressed in
nonneuronal cell lines, and another was preferentially expressed in
tumor cells.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Li et al. (1994) mapped the CAMK2G gene to human
chromosome 10q22. Ahmed et al. (2001) stated that CAMK2G is 1 of 3 genes
that are nested in the introns of PCDH15 (605514).

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse cardiomyocytes, Zhu et al. (2003) demonstrated that
beta-1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1; 109630)-induced apoptosis was
resistant to inhibition of PKA (see 176911). Rather, the Adrb1
proapoptotic effect was associated with non-Pka-dependent increases in
intracellular Ca(2+) and Camk2 activity. Blocking the L-type Ca(2+)
channel (see 114205), buffering intracellular Ca(2+), or inhibiting
Camk2 activity fully protected cardiomyocytes against Adrb1-induced
apoptosis; overexpressing the c splice variant of Camk2d markedly
exaggerated the Adrb1 apoptotic effect. Zhu et al. (2003) concluded that
CAMK2 constitutes a PKA-independent linkage of ADRB1 stimulation to
cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Among 304 Swiss individuals tested and genotyped, de Quervain and
Papassotiropoulos (2006) found a significant association (p = 0.00008)
between short-term episodic memory performance and genetic variations in
a 7-gene cluster consisting of the ADCY8 (103070), PRKACG (176893),
CAMK2G, GRIN2A (138253), GRIN2B (138252), GRM3 (601115), and PRKCA
(176960) genes, all of which have well-established molecular and
biologic functions in animal memory. Functional MRI studies in an
independent set of 32 individuals with similar memory performance showed
a correlation between activation in memory-related brain regions,
including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and genetic
variability in the 7-gene cluster. De Quervain and Papassotiropoulos
(2006) concluded that these 7 genes encode proteins of the memory
formation signaling cascade that are important for human memory
function.

To study the role of CaMKII in T cells, Bui et al. (2000) generated
transgenic mice expressing a partially calcium-independent mutant form
of CAMKG (thr287 to asp). The size of the thymus was increased 1.5- to
2-fold in these mice, at least in part due to an increase in the life
span of double-positive thymocytes. There was an increase in the number
of T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs that had acquired an
antigen-dependent memory phenotype. These T cells were bona fide memory
cells as assessed by a variety of criteria. In addition, T cells from
wildtype mice acquired calcium-independent CaMKII activity after several
rounds of antigen-stimulated division. The authors proposed that CaMKII
controls a distinct process of activation-induced cellular
differentiation.

Using gene targeting, Zhang et al. (2005) developed a mouse model of
cardiac Camk2 inhibition and demonstrated substantial prevention of
maladaptive remodeling from excessive beta-adrenergic receptor
stimulation and myocardial infarction, and induction of balanced changes
in excitation-contraction coupling that preserved baseline and
beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated physiologic increases in cardiac
function. Zhang et al. (2005) concluded that CAMK2 is a determinant of
clinically important heart disease phenotypes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CAMK2G, ARG292PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to intellectual disability has not been confirmed.

In a boy with severe intellectual disability with self mutilation,
myopia, strabismus, mitochondrial dysfunction without mitochondrial gene
defects, short stature, flat face with narrow forehead, long palpebral
fissures, arched eyebrows, sacral dimple, short hands, brachydactyly,
and short feet, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous
875G-C transversion resulting in an arg29-to-pro (R29P) substitution.
The patient had normal array and MLL2 testing.

602731	TITLE *602731 FYN-BINDING PROTEIN; FYB
;;SLAP130;;
p120/130;;
ADHESION AND DEGRANULATION ADAPTOR PROTEIN; ADAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

T-cell receptor signaling involves activation of the src
protein-tyrosine kinases LCK (153390) and FYN (137025), leading to the
phosphorylation of various substrates including SLP76 (LCP2; 601603). Da
Silva et al. (1993) identified FYB (called p120/130 by them), a 120- and
130-kD protein doublet that associates with the SH2 domain of FYN.
T-cell receptor ligation led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
FYB. Da Silva et al. (1997) showed that the 120- and 130-kD doublet is
composed of 2 related isoforms of FYB. In T cells from FYN mutant mice,
the phosphorylation of FYB was reduced, but not abolished, suggesting to
da Silva et al. (1997) that FYB could be phosphorylated by another
kinase. By screening a Jurkat T-cell line expression library with
antibodies against FYB, da Silva et al. (1997) identified FYB cDNAs.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the 4.5-kb FYB mRNA is expressed
only in myeloid and T cells. Expression of FYB in mammalian cells
yielded a protein that migrated at 120 kD on SDS-PAGE. By Western
blotting, da Silva et al. (1997B) showed that FYB coimmunoprecipitated
with FYN and with SLP76 in mammalian cell lysates. They concluded that
FYB acts as a component of the FYN and SLP76 signaling cascades in T
cells.

Musci et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding SLAP130, a 130-kD
phosphoprotein that is associated with SLP76. Da Silva et al. (1997)
stated that SLAP130 is identical to FYB except for 2 conservative and 1
nonconservative amino acid substitutions. Musci et al. (1997) attributed
the difference between the calculated mass of SLAP130 (86 kD) and the
observed mass by SDS-PAGE (130 kD) to posttranslational modifications or
the abundance of charged amino acids.

Da Silva et al. (1997) used the human FYB cDNA to clone the mouse
homolog. The sequence of the predicted 783-amino acid human FYB protein
shares 77% identity with that of mouse FYB.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoblot analysis, Geng et al. (2001) showed that FCER1A (147140)
aggregation induces rapid FYB tyrosine phosphorylation in rat basophilic
leukemia mast cells and the release of beta hexosaminidase (see 606873).
Confocal microscopy demonstrated that FYB colocalizes with actin (see
ACTA1; 102610) in membrane ruffles. FYB overexpression enhanced mast
cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN1; 135600) and SH3 domain-mediated
release of beta hexosaminidase, implying increased histamine release as
well. Mast cell adhesion had no effect on FYB phosphorylation but
enhanced beta hexosaminidase release.

Medeiros et al. (2007) presented evidence for a previously unrecognized
function for ADAP in regulating T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated
activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011).
Stimulation of ADAP-deficient mouse T cells with antibodies to CD3 (see
186740) and CD28 (186760) resulted in impaired nuclear translocation of
NF-kappa-B, a reduced DNA binding, and delayed degradation and decreased
phosphorylation of I-kappa-B (see 164008). TCR-stimulated assembly of
the CARMA1 (607210)-BCL10 (603517)-MALT1 (604860) complex was
substantially impaired in the absence of ADAP. Medeiros et al. (2007)
further identified a region of ADAP that is required for association
with the CARMA1 adaptor and NF-kappa-B activation but is not required
for ADAP-dependent regulation of adhesion.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting strategies, Griffiths et al. (2001) and Peterson et
al. (2001) each generated mice lacking Fyb expression in mature T
lymphocytes. Although lymphocyte development was normal in these mice,
splenic CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
numbers were reduced, suggesting that Fyb may be required for peripheral
T-cell homeostasis. T-cell proliferation in response to phorbol ester
was normal in Fyb-deficient cells, but responses to anti-CD3E (186830),
with or without anti-CD28 (186760), were reduced, as were cytokine
production and activation marker upregulation. These results
demonstrated that Fyb acts as a positive regulator of T-cell activation.
Fyb-deficient mice also had reduced antibody production to T-dependent
antigens in vivo. Although downstream signaling pathways and antigen
receptor clustering were normal, clustering of the integrin LFA1 (see
153370 and 600065) was not. Flow chamber analysis demonstrated that
anti-CD3E-stimulated but not phorbol ester-stimulated Fyb-deficient T
cells were defective in adhering to mouse Icam1 (147840), to human ICAM2
(146630), and to other substrates mediated by integrins, although
integrin expression was not reduced. Using confocal microscopy, Peterson
et al. (2001) showed that Fyb-deficient T cells had normal clustering of
actin but no polarization of LFA1, whereas LFA1 clustering was markedly
increased in wildtype T cells. Griffiths et al. (2001) concluded that
the T-cell receptor-induced adhesion defect in integrin activation was
due to a block in 'inside-out' signaling between the T-cell receptor and
integrins. Peterson et al. (2001) and Griffiths et al. (2001) proposed
that on the basis of these findings and studies by Geng et al. (2001),
which implicated FYB in vasoactive mediator release, that FYB be
redesignated 'adhesion and degranulation adaptor protein,' or ADAP.

600481	TITLE *600481 STEROL REGULATORY ELEMENT-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2; SREBF2
;;STEROL REGULATORY ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 2; SREBP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding protein-2 (SREBP2) is
structurally related to SREBP1 (SREBF1; 184756), and both control
cholesterol homeostasis by stimulating transcription of sterol-regulated
genes (summary by Osborne, 2001).

CLONING

Hua et al. (1993) cloned SREBF2 from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The
deduced 1,141-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 124
kD. SREBF2 has an acidic N-terminal domain, a basic helix-loop-helix
leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) motif, and a long C terminus. It also has
histidine, glutamic acid, and arginine residues implicated in DNA
recognition by other bHLH-ZIP proteins. SREBF2 and SREBF1 share 47%
amino acid identity overall and 71% identity in the bHLH-ZIP region.
Northern blot analysis revealed a major SREBF2 transcript of 5.2 kb in
all tissues examined. A minor transcript of about 4.2 kb was also
observed.

Miserez et al. (1997) found that SREBP2 was expressed ubiquitously as 2
mRNAs (4.2 and 5.2 kb) that differ in their 3-prime untranslated regions
because of different polyadenylation signals.

GENE STRUCTURE

Miserez et al. (1997) found that the SREBF2 gene contains 19 exons and
spans 72 kb, with a sterol regulatory element in the promoter region.

MAPPING

Hua et al. (1995) isolated a genomic cosmid clone for SREBF2 and mapped
the gene to 22q13 by analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

By transfection of human 293 cells, Hua et al. (1993) found that SREBF2,
like SREBF1, drove transcription from a reporter gene containing SRE1 in
both the presence or absence of sterols.

Cholesterol homeostasis in animal cells is achieved by regulated
cleavage of SREBPs, membrane-bound transcription factors. Proteolytic
release of the active domains of SREBPs from membranes requires a
sterol-sensing protein called SCAP (601510), which forms a complex with
SREBPs. In sterol-depleted cells, DeBose-Boyd et al. (1999) found that
SCAP escorts SREBPs from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi,
where SREBPs are cleaved by site-1 protease (S1P; 603355). The authors
showed that sterols block this transport and abolish cleavage.
Relocating active S1P from Golgi to ER by treating cells with brefeldin
A or by fusing the ER retention signal KDEL to S1P obviated the SCAP
requirement and rendered cleavage insensitive to sterols. DeBose-Boyd et
al. (1999) concluded that transport-dependent proteolysis may be a
common mechanism to regulate the processing of membrane proteins.

Shimano et al. (1997) concluded that SREBP2 can replace SREBP1 in
regulating cholesterol synthesis in livers of mice and that the higher
potency of SREBP2 leads to excessive hepatic cholesterol synthesis in
these animals.

See review by Osborne (2001).

Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) and Rayner et al. (2010) found that the
microRNA miR33 (612156) embedded within intron 16 of the SREBP2 gene
plays a role in control of cholesterol homeostasis through
posttranscriptional repression of the adenosine triphosphate-binding
cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1; 600046).

Jeon et al. (2008) found that the nuclear level of hepatic Srebp2 was
elevated in mice fed a diet supplemented with lovastatin and ezetimibe
(L/E) to limit dietary sterol absorption and reduce HMG-CoA reductase
(HMGCR; 142910) activity. Genomic promoter-wide ChIP-chip analysis
revealed that Srebp2 bound a number of promoters for genes encoding
bitter taste-responding type-2 taste receptors (T2Rs; see 604867), which
are expressed in gut enteroendocrine cells and in the tongue and oral
cavity. Sterol depletion in the mouse enteroendocrine cell line STC-1,
or expression of human SREBP2 in STC-1 cells, led to increased T2R
expression. T2R expression was also increased in the proximal small
intestine of L/E-treated mice. In contrast, T2R expression in the tongue
was not induced by L/E feeding. Jeon et al. (2008) proposed that a low
cholesterol diet may induce SREBP2-mediated activation of bitter
signaling in the gut to prevent absorption of potentially toxic bitter
substances in plant-derived foods, in addition to maximizing lipid
uptake.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lee et al. (2003) showed the crystal structure of importin-beta (see
602738) complexed with the active form of SREBP2. Importin-beta uses
characteristic long helices like a pair of chopsticks to interact with
an SREBP2 dimer. Importin-beta changes its conformation to reveal a
pseudo-2-fold symmetry on its surface structure so that it can
accommodate a symmetric dimer molecule.

EVOLUTION

Najafi-Shoushtari et al. (2010) identified the MIR33A gene within intron
16 of the SREBP2 gene. Brown et al. (2010) noted that the precursor for
mature miR33A is found within the same intron of SREBP2 from many animal
species, including large and small mammals, chickens, and frogs. There
is even a perfectly conserved mature form of miR33A in the single
SREBP-like gene of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The latter is
most remarkable because insects do not synthesize sterols; their single
SREBP gene controls fatty acid production. Moreover, the fruit fly
genome does not contain ABCA1. While miR33A exhibits uniform
conservation, miR33B (613486), present in intron 17 of the SREBP1 gene
(184756), is present only in large mammals.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Yang et al. (1994) found a mutation in SREBF2 in a mutant CHO cell line
that is resistant to transcriptional repression by
25-hydroxycholesterol. The truncated gene product activates the LDL
receptor (606945) and HMG-CoA synthase (142940) genes independent of
sterols. The authors speculated that mutations or polymorphisms in
SREBF1 or SREBF2 could explain in part the wide variation in levels of
LDL-cholesterol seen in the general population.

Muller and Miserez (2002) presented evidence suggesting that mutations
in the SREBF2 gene are associated with hypercholesterolemia in man.

ANIMAL MODEL

In Abcg5 (605459)/Abcg8 (605460)-deficient mice, Yang et al. (2004)
demonstrated that accumulation of plant sterols perturbed cholesterol
homeostasis in the adrenal gland, with a 91% reduction in its
cholesterol content. Despite very low cholesterol levels, there was no
compensatory increase in cholesterol synthesis or in lipoprotein
receptor expression. Adrenal cholesterol levels returned to near-normal
levels in mice treated with ezetimibe, which blocks phytosterol
absorption. In cultured adrenal cells, stigmasterol but not sitosterol
inhibited SREBF2 processing and reduced cholesterol synthesis;
stigmasterol also activated the liver X receptor (see LXRA; 602423) in a
cell-based reporter assay. Yang et al. (2004) concluded that selected
dietary plant sterols disrupt cholesterol homeostasis by affecting 2
critical regulatory pathways of lipid metabolism.

Lens opacity-13 (lop13) is a spontaneous autosomal recessive mouse
mutant that exhibits nuclear cataracts. Merath et al. (2011) found that
mature cataracts developed in lop13 mice by 10 weeks of age and that
hypermature cataracts developed by 3 months of age. Histologic analysis
of lop13 eyes revealed swollen lens fiber cells and the presence of
bladder cells within the lens cortex, as well as morgagnian globules and
liquefied material at the lens posterior. Lens epithelial cells at the
anterior of the lens were normal. Lop13 mice also developed persistent
skin wounds at around 3 months of age, although lop13 skin was
indistinguishable from wildtype. Sequence analysis revealed a 3112C-T
mutation in exon 18 of the Srebf2 gene in lop13 mice, resulting in the
substitution of a highly conserved arginine within the Srebf2 regulatory
domain with cysteine (R1038C). Biochemical analysis revealed
significantly decreased cholesterol levels in lop13 brain and liver
compared with wildtype; however, serum cholesterol levels were normal.
Knockout of Srebf2 resulted in early embryonic lethality, but Srebf2 +/-
mice appeared normal. Since the adult ocular lens is nonvascularized,
Merath et al. (2011) hypothesized that SREBF2 and de novo cholesterol
synthesis are essential for normal lens function.

;;UBC4/5, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME UBCH5B; UBCH5B;;
UBC4
DESCRIPTION See UBE2D1 (602961) for general information about ubiquitination and the
UBC4/5 subfamily of E2 enzymes.

CLONING

By PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved
regions of S. cerevisiae UBC5 and the related Drosophila UbcD1, Jensen
et al. (1995) identified a human peripheral blood lymphocyte cDNA
encoding UBCH5B, or UBE2D2. The predicted 147-amino acid UBCH5B and
UBCH5C (UBE2D3; 602963) proteins have only 4 amino acid differences, 3
of which are conservative changes; the nucleotide sequences of their
cDNAs are 87% identical within the coding region and 23% conserved
within the 3-prime untranslated region. The UBCH5B protein has 95%
sequence identity with the Drosophila UbcD1 protein, 93% identity with
C. elegans ubc2, 89% identity with human UBCH5A (UBE2D1), and 79%
identity with S. cerevisiae UBC4 and UBC5, and Arabidopsis thaliana UBC8
and UBC9. Recombinant UBCH5B expressed in E. coli had a molecular mass
of 16 kD by SDS-PAGE. Quantitative PCR detected UBCH5B expression in all
human tissues examined.

Independently, Rolfe et al. (1995) isolated a HeLa cell cDNA encoding
UBE2D2, which they called UBC4. Jensen et al. (1995) noted that the
coding sequences of this UBC4 cDNA and the UBCH5B cDNA isolated by them
have 3 nucleotide differences, 1 of which results in an amino acid
substitution.

GENE FUNCTION

Jensen et al. (1995) demonstrated that UBCH5B could conjugate ubiquitin
to target proteins in an E6AP (UBE3A; 601623)-dependent manner.

Rolfe et al. (1995) showed that UBC4 specifically ubiquitinated E6AP and
that in vivo inhibition of UBC4 led to inhibition of E6-stimulated p53
(TP53; 191170) degradation.

Kim et al. (2005) noted that the ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme
UBCH5B is part of a ubiquitin-ligating (E3) complex with CULLIN1 (CUL1;
603134), SKP1 (601434), ROC1 (RBX1; 603814), and BTRC (603482). By yeast
2-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and Western blot analyses, Kim et al.
(2005) found that the Shigella flexneri effector protein OspG interacted
with a number of E2 enzymes, including UBCH5B. Transfection experiments
showed that OspG prevented phosphorylated IKBA (NFKBIA; 164008)
degradation and NFKB (164011) activation mediated by the
UBCH5B-containing E3 complex. Inactivation of OspG, on the other hand,
increased IKBA degradation in infected epithelial cells and increased
the inflammatory response in vivo. Kim et al. (2005) concluded that OspG
negatively controls the host innate immune response induced by S.
flexneri invasion of the epithelium.

612027	TITLE *612027 GRP1-ASSOCIATED SCAFFOLD PROTEIN; GRASP
;;TAMALIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nevrivy et al. (2000) cloned mouse Grasp. The deduced 392-amino acid
protein has an alanine/proline-rich N-terminal region containing an Src
(190090) homology-3 domain-binding site (PxxP), followed by a PDZ domain
and a leucine-rich domain. It shares substantial similarity with
proteins of the MAGUK family (see 606959) and with RGS12 (602512).
RT-PCR detected high expression in mouse brain, moderate expression in
lung and heart, and low expression in kidney, ovary, and embryo.
Epitope-tagged Grasp localized to the plasma membrane of transfected
human embryonic kidney cells.

By searching databases, Kitano et al. (2003) identified orthologs of rat
Grasp, which they called tamalin, in several species, including human.
Human tamalin contains 395 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Using subtractive hybridization, Nevrivy et al. (2000) found that
all-trans retinoic acid upregulated expression of Grasp in a mouse
embryo cell line. Yeast 2-hybrid screening and in vitro pull-down assays
showed that the leucine-rich region of Grasp interacted with the
N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Grp1 (PSCD3; 605081). Grasp also
interacted with the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of cytohesin-2 (PSCD2;
602488) in pull-down assays. In transfected HEK293 cells, Grasp enhanced
Grp1 association with the plasma membrane and also colocalized with
endogenous ADP-ribosylation factors (see ARF1, 103180) at the plasma
membrane. Mutation analysis showed the alanine/proline-rich region
and/or the PDZ domain of Grasp directed membrane localization.

Kitano et al. (2003) showed that rat tamalin interacted with multiple
neuronal proteins through its protein-binding domains. The PDZ domain of
tamalin bound to the PDZ-binding motifs of Sap90/Psd95-associated
protein (DLGAP3; 611413) and tamalin itself, whereas the PDZ-binding
motif of tamalin interacted with the PDZ domain of Sscam (MAGI2;
606382). Tamalin formed a complex with Psd95 (DLG4; 602887) and Mint2
(APBA2; 602712) by mechanisms other than PDZ-mediated interactions.
Tamalin assembled with these proteins in vivo, and the tamalin protein
complex was verified by coimmunoprecipitation of rat brain lysates.
Kitano et al. (2003) concluded that tamalin forms a protein complex with
multiple postsynaptic and protein-trafficking scaffold proteins.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GRASP
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP STS-AA024848).

ANIMAL MODEL

Ogawa et al. (2007) obtained tamalin-knockout mice in the expected
mendelian ratio, and these mice were viable and fertile with normal
physical, behavioral, and emotional characteristics. However, tamalin
deficiency reduced both acute and adaptive responses to morphine and
cocaine.

TRIAD DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; TRIAD1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinc-binding cysteine and histidine residues that form a 3-dimensional
structure, stabilized by zinc, are found in protein-interacting motifs
in LIM (e.g., LMO1; 186921), RING (e.g., RING1; 602045), or LAP (e.g.,
AF10; 602409) finger-containing proteins. Van der Reijden et al. (1999)
identified ARIH2, which they termed TRIAD1, a 493-amino acid nuclear
protein upregulated during retinoic acid-induced granulocytic
differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. ARIH2 contains 2
RING fingers flanking a conserved cysteine-rich (C6HC) domain the
authors designated DRIL (double RING finger-linked domain); 2 C-terminal
coiled-coil domains; and an acidic N-terminal region. The DRIL domain
with its 2 flanking RING fingers, collectively referred to by the
authors as the TRIAD (2 RING fingers and DRIL) domain, spans
approximately 200 amino acids and was identified, with a preserved order
and distance, in more than 20 eukaryotic proteins.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ARIH2
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP WI-11545).

604846	TITLE *604846 HEPARAN SULFATE 6-O-SULFOTRANSFERASE 1; HS6ST1
;;HS6ST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heparan sulfate (HS) 6-O-sulfotransferase catalyzes the transfer of
sulfate from 3-prime-phosphoadenosine 5-prime-phosphosulfate to position
6 of the N-sulfoglucosamine residue of heparan sulfate (Habuchi et al.,
1998).

CLONING

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library with a Chinese hamster
Hs6st cDNA, Habuchi et al. (1998) isolated human HS6ST cDNAs. The
predicted 401-amino acid human HS6ST protein is a type II transmembrane
protein, with an N-terminal transmembrane domain. A putative cleavage
site occurs near the C-terminal end of the transmembrane domain. HS6ST
contains 2 potential N-glycosylation sites. It does not share
significant sequence similarity to other known sulfotransferases,
including HS2ST. HS6ST does not contain a conserved
3-prime-phosphoadenosine 5-prime-phosphosulfate-binding site sequence,
or a 'P-loop,' which is found in most sulfotransferases and has been
implicated as an ATP- or GTP-binding site. Northern blot analysis of
human fetal brain RNA detected a 3.9-kb HS6ST transcript.

Habuchi et al. (2000) cloned Hs6st1 from a mouse brain cDNA library. The
deduced 401-amino acid protein has characteristics of a type II
transmembrane protein, with a short N-terminal segment followed by a
hydrophobic sequence. It also contains 2 N-glycosylation sites. Northern
blot analysis detected a 3.9-kb Hs6st1 transcript in most mouse tissues
examined, with predominant expression in liver.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HS6ST1
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH78052).

GENE FUNCTION

Habuchi et al. (1998) found that recombinant HS6ST expressed in
mammalian cells exhibited HS6ST activity.

Habuchi et al. (2000) demonstrated elevated 6-O-sulfotransferase
activity in the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells transfected with mouse Hs6st1.
Hs6st1 was also secreted into the medium. Hs6st1 showed
6-O-sulfotransferase activity against HS, N-sulfated heparosan, heparin,
and some HS derivatives. It did not show sulfotransferase activity
toward other glycosaminoglycans examined.

In experiments in C. elegans, Tornberg et al. (2011) observed that HS
cell-specifically regulates neural branching in vivo in concert with
other genes that are associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (see
147950), including KAL1 (300836), FGF8 (600483), and FGFR1 (136350). The
findings were consistent with a model in which KAL1 acts as a modulatory
coligand with FGF to activate the FGF receptor in an HS-dependent
manner.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 7 probands with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with or without anosmia
(HH15; 614880), Tornberg et al. (2011) identified 5 heterozygous
missense mutations (604846.0001-604846.0005). All of the HS6ST1 variants
affected highly conserved residues, exhibited reduced activity compared
to wildtype, and were not found in 500 controls or the SNP database.
Because clinical variability was evident both within and across families
carrying the same genetic variant, Tornberg et al. (2011) analyzed 8
additional HH-associated genes to test whether other genetic factors
were contributing to the observed variability, and identified
heterozygous variants in the FGFR1 gene (136350.0025) and in the NELF
gene (608137.0001) in 2 of the HH families, respectively. The authors
concluded that the identified HS6ST1 missense mutations might not be
sufficient to cause disease, and suggested that HS6ST1 represents an
important gene contributing pathogenic alleles to the genetic network
responsible for the neuroendocrine control of human reproduction.

In the HH family in which Tornberg et al. (2011) had identified
mutations in both the HS6ST1 (604846.0002) and FGFR1 (136350.0025)
genes, Miraoui et al. (2013) analyzed 7 genes involved in the FGF8
(600483)-FGFR1 (136350) network and identified additional mutations in 2
more genes, FGF17 (603725.0001) and FLRT3 (604808.0001 and 604808.0002).
Miraoui et al. (2013) concluded that mutations in genes encoding
components of the FGF pathway are associated with complex modes of
congenital HH (CHH) inheritance and act primarily as contributors to an
oligogenic genetic architecture underlying CHH.

HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 15 WITH OR WITHOUT ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY
TO
HS6ST1, ARG372TRP

In 1 female and 2 male probands from 3 unrelated families with
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH15; 614880), 1 with anosmia and 2 with
a normal sense of smell, Tornberg et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 1114C-T transition in the HS6ST1 gene, resulting in
an arg372-to-trp (R372W) substitution at a highly conserved residue. In
vitro functional analysis demonstrated a 25 to 35% reduction in
enzymatic activity with the R372W mutant compared to wildtype, and in an
in vivo assay involving C. elegans, the R372W mutant displayed a reduced
capacity to rescue a kal1 (300836)-dependent axon branching phenotype
compared to wildtype HS6ST1. The mutation was not found in the SNP
database or in 500 ethnically and age-matched controls. The female HH
proband had absent puberty whereas the 2 male probands had partial
puberty, and 1 male patient, who was anosmic, had osteoporosis, whereas
the other male patient had osteopenia. In addition, the female proband
had a brother with delayed puberty who did not carry the HS6ST1 R372W
mutation, whereas the anosmic male proband had an unaffected brother who
did carry the mutation. Analysis of 8 known HH-associated genes in these
families revealed that the anosmic male proband carried an additional
heterozygous missense mutation in the NELF gene (608137.0001); no other
mutations were identified. Tornberg et al. (2011) concluded that
mutations in HS6ST1 might not be sufficient to cause disease, but rather
contribute to HH via oligogenic interactions with other genes in the
genetic network responsible for neuroendocrine control of human
reproduction.

.0002
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 15 WITH ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
HS6ST1, ARG296TRP

In a 55-year-old woman with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with anosmia
(HH15; 614880) from a large French Canadian pedigree with several
consanguineous loops, previously reported by White et al. (1983) and in
which affected individuals displayed variable phenotypes, Tornberg et
al. (2011) identified homozygosity for an 886C-T transition in the
HS6ST1 gene, resulting in an arg296-to-trp (R296W) substitution at a
highly conserved residue. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated an
approximately 50% reduction in enzymatic activity with the R296W mutant
compared to wildtype, and in an in vivo assay involving C. elegans, the
R296W mutant displayed a reduced capacity to rescue a kal1
(300836)-dependent axon branching phenotype compared to wildtype HS6ST1.
The mutation was not found in the SNP database or in 500 ethnically and
age-matched controls. Additional features in the proband included
bilateral genu valgus and osteoporosis with multiple vertebral and
tibial fractures. The proband's brother, who also had anosmic HH, was
heterozygous for the R296W mutation, as was their unaffected father and
3 other family members, including 1 with anosmic HH, 1 with anosmic HH
and cleft palate, and 1 unaffected individual. Other phenotypes among
untested family members included normosmic HH in 1 individual and
isolated cleft palate in 3. Analysis of 8 known HH-associated genes
revealed that the proband, her brother, and their unaffected father all
carried an additional heterozygous missense mutation in the FGFR1 gene
(R250Q; 136350.0025), as did 2 other family members, 1 with anosmic HH
and 1 with anosmic HH and cleft palate. The FGFR1 mutation was also
found in heterozygosity in an unaffected family member who did not carry
the R296W HS6ST1 mutation. No mutations were identified in the other
HH-associated genes. Tornberg et al. (2011) concluded that mutations in
HS6ST1 might not be sufficient to cause disease, but rather contribute
to HH via oligogenic interactions with other genes in the genetic
network responsible for neuroendocrine control of human reproduction.

In the French Canadian pedigree in which Tornberg et al. (2011) had
identified mutations in both the FGFR1 and HS6ST1 genes, Miraoui et al.
(2013) identified additional mutations in 2 FGF-network genes, FGF17
(I108T; 603725.0001) and FLRT3 (E97G, 604808.0001 and S144I,
604808.0002).

.0003
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 15 WITH ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
HS6ST1, ARG296GLN

In a 10.5-year-old boy with anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH15;
614880), born of consanguineous parents, Tornberg et al. (2011)
identified heterozygosity for an 887G-A transition in the HS6ST1 gene,
resulting in an arg296-to-gln (R296Q) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated an approximately 15
to 30% reduction in enzymatic activity with the R296Q mutant compared to
wildtype, and in an in vivo assay involving C. elegans, the R296Q mutant
displayed a reduced capacity to rescue a kal1 (300836)-dependent axon
branching phenotype compared to wildtype HS6ST1. The mutation was not
found in the SNP database or in 500 ethnically and age-matched controls.
MRI at 11 months of age revealed a normal hypothalamic area and small
pituitary, although the olfactory bulbs and nerves could not be
assessed. The proband's mother, who had only delayed puberty and a
normal sense of smell, was also heterozygous for the mutation. Tornberg
et al. (2011) proposed that mutations in HS6ST1 contribute to HH via
oligogenic interactions with other genes in the genetic network
responsible for neuroendocrine control of human reproduction.

.0004
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 15 WITH ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
HS6ST1, ARG313GLN

In a 30-year-old man who was born with anosmic hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (HH15; 614880), cleft palate, and bilateral genu valgus,
Tornberg et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a 938G-A transition
in the HS6ST1 gene, resulting in an arg313-to-gln (R313Q) substitution
at a highly conserved residue. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated
an approximately 30% reduction in enzymatic activity with the R313Q
mutant compared to wildtype when HS was the acceptor substrate, whereas
mutant activity was similar to wildtype when completely desulfated
re-N-sulfated heparin was used as the substrate. In an in vivo assay
involving C. elegans, the R313Q mutant displayed a reduced capacity to
rescue a kal1 (300836)-dependent axon branching phenotype compared to
wildtype HS6ST1. The mutation was not found in the SNP database or in
500 ethnically and age-matched controls. MRI in the proband showed
absent olfactory bulbs and a normal pituitary. The proband's father, who
had only delayed puberty, and an asymptomatic, fertile sister were both
also heterozygous for the mutation, whereas another sister with anosmia
did not carry the mutation. In addition, the paternal grandmother had
delayed puberty, and the paternal grandfather was anosmic. Tornberg et
al. (2011) proposed that mutations in HS6ST1 contribute to HH via
oligogenic interactions with other genes in the genetic network
responsible for human reproduction.

.0005
HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM 15 WITH ANOSMIA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
HS6ST1, MET394VAL

In a 36-year-old man who had anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(HH15; 614880), Tornberg et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a
1180A-G transition in the HS6ST1 gene, resulting in a met394-to-val
(M394V) substitution at a highly conserved residue. In vitro functional
analysis demonstrated a 30 to 70% reduction in enzymatic activity with
the M394V mutant compared to wildtype, and in an in vivo assay involving
C. elegans, the M394V mutant displayed a reduced capacity to rescue a
kal1 (300836)-dependent axon branching phenotype compared to wildtype
HS6ST1. The mutation was not found in the SNP database or in 500
ethnically and age-matched controls. At 21 years of age, the proband
presented for failure to undergo puberty. He was overweight and
eunuchoidal, with Tanner II pubic hair and small testes, and had severe
bilateral genu valgus. While the patient was on replacement testosterone
therapy, his wife conceived. Later, he was found to have a normal adult
serum testosterone level and normal sperm count after having
discontinued his replacement therapy, indicating reversal of his
GnRH-deficiency HH. Fourteen years later, repeat neuroendocrine
evaluation confirmed a sustained reversal of his GnRH deficiency; MRI
scan showed absent olfactory bulbs and a small pituitary gland.

605590	TITLE *605590 SPLICING FACTOR 3B, SUBUNIT 1; SF3B1
;;SF3B, 155-KD SUBUNIT; SF3B155;;
SPLICEOSOME-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 155-KD; SAP155
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Introns are removed from nuclear pre-mRNA in 2 transesterification
reactions. Splicing takes place in a large ribonucleoprotein particle,
the spliceosome. Spliceosomal intermediate complexes form on pre-mRNA in
the order E, A, B, and C, with the catalytic reactions occurring in
complex C. U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs; see 180690) are
among the proteins essential for spliceosome assembly and mRNA splicing.
Functional U2 snRNP is composed of a 12S unit and 2 splicing factors,
SF3A, which is composed of 3 proteins (see SF3A1; 605595), and SF3B,
which is composed of 4 proteins, including SF3B1 (summary by Kramer et
al. (1995), Wang et al. (1998), and Isono et al. (2001)).

CLONING

By SDS-PAGE fractionation of spliceosomal complex A, micropeptide
sequence analysis, database searching, and cDNA library screening, Wang
et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA encoding SF3B1, which they called SAP155.
Sequence analysis predicted that the 1,304-amino acid protein is 50%
identical to the yeast sequence. The C-terminal two-thirds of SF3B1 can
align into 22 PP2A (PPP2R1B; 603113)-like repeats, and the nonconserved
N terminus contains multiple TPGH and RWDETP motifs but lacks SR
domains. Western blot analysis detected the 155-kD protein in the
spliceosomal A/B complex and a larger phosphorylated protein in the C
complex. The authors showed that the phosphorylation occurs concomitant
with the catalytic steps of splicing.

Isono et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding the 146-kD mouse homolog.
The amino acid sequence of Sf3b1 was very highly conserved among
homologs from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (52.4% identity) to human
(99.6%), and the C-terminal 825 residues of these homologs showed even
higher identities.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Golas et al. (2003) determined the 3-dimensional structure of the human
SF3B complex by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at a resolution
of less than 10 angstroms, allowing identification of protein domains
with known structural folds. The best fit of a modeled RNA recognition
motif indicates that the protein p14 (607835) is located in the central
cavity of the complex. The 22 tandem helical repeats of the protein
SF3B155 are located in the outer shell of the complex enclosing p14.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and pull-down assays of mouse nuclear
extracts, Isono et al. (2005) found that Sf3b1 interacted directly with
the Polycomb group proteins Pcgf2 (600346) and Rnf2 (608985).
Furthermore, Sf3b1 colocalized with Polycomb proteins on the 5-prime
regions of individual Hox genes.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SF3B1
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP stSG34935).

Isono et al. (2001) mapped the mouse homolog of human SF3B1 to the
central part of chromosome 1 by interspecific backcross analysis. This
location was also consistent with the mapping data obtained by using a
radiation hybrid panel.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutations

Using whole-exome sequencing of bone marrow cells, Papaemmanuil et al.
(2011) found that 6 of 9 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS;
614286) carried 1 of 2 somatic heterozygous mutations in the SF3B1 gene:
a lys700-to-glu (K700E) substitution or a his662-to-gln (H662Q)
substitution, in addition to somatic mutations in several other genes.
Targeted resequencing of this gene found that 72 (20%) of 354 patients
with MDS had mutations in the SF3B1 gene. The majority of the patients
(68%) with mutations had refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts,
although 6% had refractory anemia with excess blasts. Mutations in the
SF3B1 gene were also found less frequently in bone marrow from patients
with other chronic myeloid disorders, such as primary myelofibrosis
(254450), essential thrombocythemia (187950), and chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia (CMML; see 607785), as well as in acute myeloid leukemia (AML;
601626). Somatic mutations were also found in about 1% of primary solid
tumors. The mutations occurred throughout the gene, but were clustered
in exons 12 to 15; K700E was the most common mutation, accounting for 59
(55%) of the 108 variants observed. Alignment and in silico studies
indicated that the mutations were not severely deleterious, suggesting
that the mutant proteins retain structural integrity and some function.
Gene expression profiling studies suggested a disturbance of
mitochondrial gene networks in stem cells from MDS patients with SF3B1
mutations. Clinically, MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations had higher
median white cell count, higher platelet count, higher erythroid
hyperplasia, lower proportion of bone marrow blasts, and overall longer
survival compared to those without SF3B1 mutations, suggesting a more
benign phenotype.

Using whole-exome sequencing of matched tumor and normal samples from
105 individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; 151400) followed
by expansion studies in an additional 174 CLL patients, Quesada et al.
(2012) found that 27 (9.7%) of the 279 patients had somatic mutations in
the SF3B1 gene. All SF3B1 mutations occurred in the nonidentical HEAT
domains, and SF3B1-mutant cases showed enhanced expression of truncated
mRNAs of various genes. Clinically, patients with SF3B1 mutations had
faster disease progression and poorer overall survival compared to those
with other mutations. No SF3B1 mutations were found in 156 cases of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (605027).

Harbour et al. (2013) described mutations occurring exclusively at codon
625 of the SF3B1 gene in low-grade uveal melanoma (155720) with good
prognosis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Isono et al. (2005) found that homozygous Sf3b1-null mouse embryos died
during preimplantation development around the 16- to 32-cell stage.
Heterozygous animals appeared normal and healthy; however, they
exhibited various skeletal alterations along the anterior-posterior
axis. Consistent with the axial changes, expression of several Hox genes
was anteriorly extended in the paraxial mesoderm and second branchial
arch. Isono et al. (2005) concluded that Sf3b1 regulates Hox gene
expression in association with Polycomb group proteins.

604567	TITLE *604567 DOUBLE C2-LIKE DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN, ALPHA; DOC2A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

C2-like domains that interact with Ca(2+) and phospholipid are found in
synaptotagmin (see 600103) and rabphilin-3A (RPH3A; 612159), proteins
implicated in neurotransmitter release. By screening a human brain cDNA
library with a fragment showing homology to rabphilin-3A, Orita et al.
(1995) isolated a novel cDNA which they named DOC2 for 'double C2.' The
cDNA predicts a 400-amino acid protein with relative mass of 44,071 Da
and 2 repeated C2-like domains in the C-terminal region. Northern blot
analysis showed high levels of a 2.2-kb DOC2 transcript in brain.
Expression of a recombinant DOC2 protein in E. coli showed that it
interacts with Ca(2+) and phospholipid.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DOC2A
gene to chromosome 16 (TMAP RH99266).

601430	TITLE *601430 UPF1, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; UPF1
;;HUPF1;;
REGULATOR OF NONSENSE TRANSCRIPTS 1; RENT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

UPF1 is a helicase that shows RNA-dependent ATPase and
5-prime-to-3-prime RNA helicase activities. The ATPase activity of UPF1
is critical to the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway, which
targets mRNAs with premature termination codons for rapid degradation
(summary by Franks et al., 2010).

CLONING

Perlick et al. (1996) noted that at least 3 transacting factors (Upf1-3)
are required for NMD in yeast. They identified a human cDNA encoding a
protein with strong homology to Upf1 that they termed RENT1. Although
divergence exists at the extreme N and C termini of the human and yeast
polypeptides, the large central region of the protein shows 58% residue
identity and 80% conservation. Perlick et al. (1996) stated that RENT1
is the first identified mammalian protein that contains all of the
putative functional elements found in Upf1, including zinc finger-like
nucleotide-binding domains and all the motifs common to members of
helicase superfamily I. By cloning of the mouse gene and subsequent
alignment of the sequences for all related helicases, Perlick et al.
(1996) demonstrated that RENT1, Upf1, Mov10, and Sen1 define a distinct
subset within the superfamily. As expected for an essential component of
the apparently ubiquitous NMD pathway, RENT1 was detected in all tissues
tested.

Independently, Applequist et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs encoding RENT1,
which they named HUPF1 (human Upf1 protein). They stated that HUPF1
encodes a predicted 1,118-amino acid protein. Western blot analysis of
human cell extracts showed that HUPF1 migrated as a 130-kD protein.
Using immunofluorescence, Applequist et al. (1997) found that human and
mouse HUPF1, like yeast Upf1, localized in the cytoplasm but not in the
nucleus. Northern blot analysis detected a predominant 5.5-kb HUPF1 mRNA
and a minor 3.7-kb HUPF1 mRNA in various human cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Perlick et al. (1996) found that expression of a chimeric protein
containing the central region of human RENT1 flanked by the extreme N
and C termini of yeast Upf1 complemented the Upf1-deficient growth
phenotype in yeast. These data demonstrated that RENT1 is a mammalian
ortholog of Upf1.

Sun et al. (1998) provided evidence for a factor that functions to
eliminate the production of nonsense-containing RNAs in mammalian cells.
They identified the factor, variously referred to as RENT1 and HUPF1, by
isolating cDNA for a human homolog of S. cerevisiae Upf1p, which is a
group I RNA helicase that functions in the nonsense-mediated decay of
mRNA in yeast. Using monkey COS cells and human HeLa cells, Sun et al.
(1998) demonstrated that expression of human Upf1 protein harboring an
arginine-to-cysteine mutation at residue 844 within the RNA helicase
domain acts in a dominant-negative fashion to abrogate the decay of
nonsense-containing mRNA that takes place in association with nuclei or
in the cytoplasm. These findings provided evidence that
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is related mechanistically in yeast and in
mammalian cells, regardless of the cellular site of decay.

Mendell et al. (2002) assessed the role of factors essential for NMD in
nonsense-mediated altered splicing (NAS) with the use of RNA
interference in mammalian cells. Inhibition of RENT1 expression
abrogated both NMD and NAS of nonsense T-cell receptor beta (TCRB; see
186930) transcripts. In contrast, inhibition of RENT2 (UPF2; 605529)
expression did not disrupt NAS despite achieving comparable
stabilization of nonsense transcripts. Mendell et al. (2002) also
demonstrated that NAS and NMD are genetically separable functions of
RENT1. Mendell et al. (2002) demonstrated that RENT1 enters the nucleus,
where it may directly influence early events in mRNA biogenesis. Mendell
et al. (2002) concluded that their results provide compelling evidence
that NAS relies on a component of the nonsense surveillance machinery
but is not an indirect consequence of NMD.

Using immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments, Ohnishi et
al. (2003) showed that SMG5 (610962) and SMG7 (610964) associated with a
hyperphosphorylated form of UPF1, and that SMG5 was involved in UPF1
dephosphorylation by the protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915)
complex. SMG5 mutants that interfered with UPF1 dephosphorylation also
inhibited nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in a dominant-negative manner.

Amrani et al. (2004) used a primer extension inhibition (toeprinting)
assay to delineate ribosome positioning and found that premature
translation termination in yeast extracts is indeed aberrant. Ribosomes
encountering premature UAA or UGA codons in the Can1 mRNA failed to
release and, instead, migrated to upstream AUGs. This anomaly depended
upon prior nonsense codon recognition and was eliminated in extracts
derived from cells lacking the principal NMD factor Upf1p, or by
flanking the nonsense codon with a normal 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR). Tethered poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1p), used as a mimic of a
normal 3-prime UTR, recruited the termination factor Sup35p (eRF3) and
stabilized nonsense-containing mRNAs. Amrani et al. (2004) concluded
that efficient termination and mRNA stability are dependent on a
properly configured 3-prime UTR.

Staufen-1 (STAU1; 601716) is an RNA-binding protein that is thought to
function in mRNA transport and translational control. Kim et al. (2005)
described an mRNA decay mechanism involving STAU1, UPF1, and a
termination codon. Unlike nonsense-mediated decay, this mechanism did
not involve pre-mRNA splicing and occurred when UPF2 or UPF3X (UPF3B;
300298) was downregulated. STAU1 bound directly to UPF1 and elicited
mRNA decay when tethered downstream of a termination codon. STAU1 also
interacted with the 3-prime UTR of ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (ARF1;
103180) mRNA. Accordingly, downregulation of either STAU1 or UPF1
increased ARF1 mRNA stability. These findings suggested that ARF1 mRNA
is a natural target for STAU1-mediated decay, and data indicated that
other mRNAs are also natural targets.

In crosslinking and coimmunoprecipitation experiments on HeLa cell
nuclear extracts, Agranat et al. (2008) showed that ADAR1 (146920)
associated with the RNA surveillance protein HUPF1 in the
supraspliceosome, a 21-megadalton nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex. The
interaction did not depend on RNA. Knockdown of ADAR1 with small
interfering RNA upregulated the expression of 4 of 6 genes that undergo
both A-to-I editing by ADARs and degradation via HUPF1.

Cellular mRNAs exist as messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes
containing the mRNA and associated proteins. Franks et al. (2010) found
that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of UPF1 in HeLa cells or
expression of an ATPase-deficient UPF1 mutant caused accumulation of an
NMD mRNP in cytoplasmic processing bodies. In the absence of UPF1 ATPase
activity, the NMD factors SMG5, SMG6 (610963), and SMG7 colocalized with
a partially degraded 3-prime mRNA intermediate in cytoplasmic processing
bodies. ATPase-deficient UPF1 copurified with multiple NMD factors,
including XRN1 (607994) and PABPC1 (604679), in addition to SMG5, SMG6,
and SMG7, and with exon junction complex components (see 608546). Franks
et al. (2010) concluded that UPF1 ATPase activity is required for
disassembly of mRNP complexes, and that disassembly of these complexes
is required for degradation of mRNA by XRN1.

MAPPING

Perlick et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Rent1 gene to mouse chromosome 8
by analysis of the Jackson Laboratory BSS backcross DNA panel. The
region of mouse chromosome 8 was known to have homology of synteny to
19p13.2-p13.11; the human probe detected human chromosome 19-specific
restriction fragments within the NIGMS human/rodent somatic cell hybrid
panel. Perlick et al. (1996) noted that although tumorigenic or
accelerated aging phenotypes might be predicted to result from the
somatic accumulation of nonsense or frameshift mutations on an
NMD-deficient background, no apparently relevant phenotypes have been
linked to the map positions for the murine or human genes on syntenic
regions of chromosomes 8 and 19p13.2-p13.11, respectively.

ANIMAL MODEL

Medghalchi et al. (2001) explored the consequences of loss of NMD
function in vertebrates through targeted disruption of the Rent1 gene,
which encodes a mammalian ortholog of Upf1p, in murine embryonic stem
cells. Mice heterozygous for the targeted allele showed no apparent
phenotypic abnormalities but homozygosity was never observed,
demonstrating that Rent1 is essential for embryonic viability.
Homozygous targeted embryos showed complete loss of NMD and were viable
in the preimplantation period, but resorbed shortly after implantation.
Furthermore, Rent1 -/- blastocysts isolated at 3.5 days postcoitum
underwent apoptosis in culture following a brief phase of cellular
expansion. The authors hypothesized that NMD is essential for mammalian
cellular viability and supports a critical role for the pathway in the
regulated expression of selected physiologic transcripts.

609731	TITLE *609731 CYSTATIN 11; CST11
;;CST8L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using subtractive hybridization to identify genes expressed in Macaca
mulatta epididymis, Hamil et al. (2002) identified a novel member of the
cystatin type 2 family of competitive reversible cysteine protease
inhibitors, which they called cystatin 11. By database searching, Hamil
et al. (2002) also identified a human homolog of CST11. An additional
CST11 cDNA, missing exon 2, was amplified by PCR from a human
caput/corpus library, indicating the presence of an alternatively
spliced mRNA. Northern blot analysis of multiple M. mulatta tissues
detected abundant expression of an 0.8-kb CST11 mRNA in all 3 regions of
the epididymis but not in any other tissues tested. Imunnohistochemical
staining of human epididymis localized the CST11 protein in epithelial
cell cytoplasm and nuclei and in the lumen throughout the epididymis.
Immuonofluorescence studies showed that CST11 is also found on
ejaculated human sperm, where it is localized to the postacrosomal and
tail regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Hamil et al. (2002) found that a 3-dimensional model of CST11, based on
x-ray crystallography data for chicken CST, suggested that the 3 regions
corresponding to the protease inhibitory wedge of cystatin-3 (CST3;
604312) are similarly juxtaposed in CST11, consistent with protease
inhibitory function.

Using Northern blot analysis to study the level of CST11 mRNA in M.
Mulatta epididymis after castration and with or without androgen
replacement, Hamil et al. (2002) found that expression of CST11 is
dependent on testosterone. Consistent with this result, they showed that
the putative CST11 promoter contains a potential androgen response
element and at least 2 half sites.

Hamil et al. (2002) demonstrated that a 2-hour incubation of E. coli
with recombinant CST11 or exon 2-deleted CST11 protein resulted in a 30%
loss of colony-forming units, indicating that both forms have
antimicrobial activity.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Hamil et al. (2002) mapped the CST11 gene to
chromosome 20p11.21 near 3 other CST genes that are predominantly
expressed in the male reproductive tract.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hamil et al. (2002) demonstrated that the structure of CST11 is well
conserved with other CST2 family genes, having 3 exons and 2 identically
positioned introns.

608122	TITLE *608122 PARVIN, GAMMA; PARVG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the parvin family, including PARVG, are actin-binding
proteins associated with focal contacts.

CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to mouse Parva
(608120), followed by RT-PCR of a human T-cell line cDNA library, Olski
et al. (2001) cloned human PARVG. Mouse and human PARVG encode a deduced
331-amino acid protein that contains a single actin-binding domain made
up of 2 calponin (600806) homology domains separated by a linker region.
Unlike PARVA and PARVB (608121), the N terminus of PARVG does not
contain nuclear localization signals or SH3-binding domains.

By analyzing PARVG ESTs, Korenbaum et al. (2001) identified
alternatively spliced sequences and a single polyadenylation site.
Northern blot analysis revealed a strong smeared signal in heart, liver,
and several other tissues. Bands of about 1.6 and 4.0 kb were detected
in peripheral blood and spleen. RNA dot blot analysis detected highest
expression in lymphatic organs (spleen, thymus, lymph node, bone marrow,
and peripheral blood leukocytes) and moderate expression in the
digestive tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, ileocecum, and
appendix), lung, and liver. In contrast, mouse Parvg showed highest
expression in testis, where there were at least 6 mRNA species. A 2.8-kb
Parvg transcript was expressed highly in spleen, moderately in lung, and
weakly in brain and heart. Parvg was expressed throughout mouse
embryonic development, with downregulation at embryonic day 11.
Korenbaum et al. (2001) stated that fluorescence-tagged PARVG, like
PARVA, localized at focal contacts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Korenbaum et al. (2001) determined that the PARVG gene contains 15 exons
and spans about 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Korenbaum et al. (2001) mapped the PARVG
gene to chromosome 22q13.31, where it lies head to tail about 12 kb
telomeric to the PARVB gene.

;;RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE SMALL SUBUNIT 2-LIKE, p53-INDUCIBLE; P53R2;;
p53-INDUCIBLE AND RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE SMALL SUBUNIT 2-LIKE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RRM2B gene encodes the small subunit of p53 (191170)-inducible
ribonucleotide reductase, a heterotetrameric enzyme responsible for de
novo conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates into the corresponding
deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates that are essential for DNA synthesis
(Bourdon et al., 2007).

CLONING

The p53 gene is frequently inactivated in human cancers. By using
differential display to examine mRNAs in a human colon cancer cell line
carrying a highly regulated wildtype p53 expression system, Tanaka et
al. (2000) detected a 5.5-kb transcript that was inducible by wildtype
p53 but not mutant p53. Using the differential display fragment
representing this transcript as a probe to screen a skeletal muscle cDNA
library, they isolated a cDNA sequence that incorporated an open reading
frame of 351 amino acids with 80% identity to the small subunit of human
ribonucleotide reductase (R2; 180390). Comparison of this sequence,
which they called p53R2 for 'p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase
small subunit 2 homolog,' with those of yeast RNR2 and RNR4 revealed 60%
and 40% identity, respectively. Tanaka et al. (2000) considered p53R2 to
be a human counterpart of yeast RNR2. The protein has a ribonucleotide
reductase small subunit signature and 2 putative nuclear localization
signal sequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tanaka et al. (2000) found that the p53R2 gene consists of 9 exons and
spans a 30-kb genomic region. Electromobility shift assays identified a
20-nucleotide region in intron 1 as the p53 binding site.

MAPPING

Tanaka et al. (2000) mapped the p53R2 gene to chromosome 8q23.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanaka et al. (2000) found that expression of p53R2, but not R2, was
induced by ultraviolet and gamma-irradiation and adriamycin treatment in
a wildtype p53-dependent manner. Induction of p53R2 in p53-deficient
cells caused G2/M arrest and protected cells from death in response to
adriamycin. Inhibition of endogenous p53R2 expression in cells that had
an intact p53-dependent DNA damage checkpoint reduced ribonucleotide
reductase activity, DNA repair, and cell survival after exposure to
various genotoxins. Tanaka et al. (2000) demonstrated nuclear
accumulation of p53R2 protein in response to genotoxic stress induced by
gamma-irradiation. Tanaka et al. (2000) concluded that p53R2 encodes a
ribonucleotide reductase that is directly involved in the p53 checkpoint
for repair of damaged DNA. The discovery of p53R2 clarified a
relationship between a ribonucleotide reductase activity involved in
repair of damaged DNA and tumor suppression by p53. Tanaka et al. (2000)
proposed that inactivation of p53 directly interferes with the
transcription of p53R2 in response to DNA damage, with the result that
ribonucleotide reductase activity is insufficient for normal DNA repair.
Faulty regulation of p53R2 might also enhance misincorporation of
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and dysregulation of DNA
repair machinery and thereby increase the frequency of mutations. Tanaka
et al. (2000) suggested that the genomic instability often seen in
tumors lacking wildtype p53 may reflect dysfunction of ribonucleotide
reductase due to the failure of p53R2 induction.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome 8A (Encephalomyopathic
Type with Renal Tubulopathy)

In 7 patients from 4 families with severe autosomal recessive
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome-8A (MTDPS8A; 612075),
associated with renal tubulopathy, Bourdon et al. (2007) identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the RRM2B gene (see,
e.g., 604712.0001-604712.0005). All patients had 1 to 2% residual mtDNA
in skeletal muscle and died in the first months of life with severe
lactic acidosis. Respiratory chain complex activities were severely
decreased in muscle from these patients. The findings indicated that
RRM2B plays a crucial role in dNTP supply, especially for the synthesis
of mtDNA.

- Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome 8B (MNGIE Type)

Shaibani et al. (2009) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the RRM2B gene (R110H, 604712.0008; R121H, 604712.0009) in
a 42-year-old woman with mtDNA depletion syndrome-8B, manifest as a
neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (see 612075). The authors stated
that this was the oldest reported patient with RRM2B mutations and that
her clinical course was different from that reported previously in
patients with MNGIE.

- Autosomal Dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia
5

By linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing in a large
North American family with mild autosomal dominant progressive external
ophthalmoplegia-5 (PEOA5; 613077), Tyynismaa et al. (2009) identified a
heterozygous mutation in the RRM2B gene (R327X; 604712.0006) that
segregated with the disorder. Affected members of an unrelated Hungarian
family carried the same mutation, but there was no evidence of a common
origin.

By direct sequencing of the RRM2B gene in 75 unrelated probands with PEO
in whom mutations in other known PEO-related genes had been excluded,
Fratter et al. (2011) identified 3 different heterozygous truncating
mutations in the RRM2B gene (see, e.g., 604712.0010 and 604712.0011) in
7 (9.3%) patients. The findings suggested that truncating RRM2B
mutations are rather frequent in familial PEO with mtDNA deletions.
Three additional patients were found to carry 3 different heterozygous
missense variants, but the pathogenicity of the variants was considered
provisional in the absence of further supporting evidence.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine whether ribonucleotide reductase is involved in DNA repair
by supplying deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) for resting cells in vivo,
Kimura et al. (2003) generated a strain of mice lacking Rrm2b. These
mice developed normally until they were weaned but from then on had
growth retardation and early mortality. Pathologic examination indicated
that multiple organs had failed, and all Rrm2b-null mice died from
severe renal failure by the age of 14 weeks. TUNEL staining showed a
greater number of apoptotic cells in kidneys of 8-week-old null mice
relative to wildtype. p53 (191170) was activated in kidney tissues of
the null mice, leading to transcriptional induction of p53 target genes.
Embryonic fibroblasts from null mice became immortal much earlier than
wildtype embryonic fibroblasts. dNTP pools were severely attenuated in
embryonic fibroblasts from null mice under oxidative stress. Rrm2b
deficiency caused higher rates of spontaneous mutation in the kidneys of
null mice. The results suggested that p53R2 has a pivotal role in
maintaining dNTP levels for repair of DNA in resting cells. Impairment
of this pathway may enhance spontaneous mutation frequency and activate
p53-dependent apoptotic pathways in vivo, causing severe renal failure,
growth retardation, and early mortality.

Bourdon et al. (2007) found that 12-week-old Rrm2b-null mice had
markedly decreased mtDNA content in kidney (5.57% of controls), muscle
(5.24%), and liver (21%).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, GLN284TER

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Moroccan parents, with mitochondrial
DNA depletion syndrome-8A (MTDPS8A; 612075), manifest as
encephalomyopathy and renal tubulopathy, Bourdon et al. (2007)
identified a homozygous 850C-T transition in the RRM2B gene, resulting
in a gln284-to-ter (Q284X) substitution. The substitution resulted in
the deletion of the last 68 C-terminal residues of the protein,
including part of the an alpha-helix as well as the heptapeptide
involved in the binding to R1. The sibs had hypotonia and lactic
acidosis and died within the first months of life. Severe mtDNA
depletion (less than 1% of controls) was found in muscle of 1 the sibs.

.0002
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH

RRM2B, IVS3AS, A-G, -2

In 2 French infants with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome-8A
(612075), manifest as encephalomyopathy with renal tubulopathy, Bourdon
et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
RRM2B gene: an A-to-G transition in intron 3 and E194K (604712.0003).
The sibs had lactic acidemia, hypotonia, tubulopathy, and seizures. Only
2% of normal mtDNA levels was detected in the muscle of 1 of the sibs.
Both died at 2 months of age.

.0003
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH

RRM2B, GLU194LYS

In 2 French infants with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome-8A
(612075), manifest as encephalomyopathy with renal tubulopathy, Bourdon
et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
RRM2B gene: a 580G-A transition, resulting in a glu194-to-lys (E194K)
substitution, and a splice site mutation (604712.0002). Residue 194 is
involved in iron binding.

.0004
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, 3-BP DEL, 253GAG

In a French infant with severe mitochondrial DNA depletion with renal
tubulopathy (612075), Bourdon et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RRM2B gene: a 3-bp deletion
(253delGAG), resulting in an in-frame deletion of glu85, and C236F
(604712.0005). The patient had neonatal hypotonia and increased plasma
and CSF lactate; she died at age 3 months. Muscle histology showed
ragged-red fibers, and mtDNA content was about 1% of normal. The
deletion of glu85 was predicted to disrupt the local subdomain structure
and the dimerization interface between R1 and R2.

.0005
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, CYS236PHE

In a French infant with severe mitochondrial DNA depletion with renal
tubulopathy (612075), Bourdon et al. (2007) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RRM2B gene: a 707G-T transversion,
resulting in a cys236-to-phe (C236F) substitution, and a 3-bp deletion
(604712.0004).

.0006
PROGRESSIVE EXTERNAL OPHTHALMOPLEGIA WITH MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DELETIONS,
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, 5
RRM2B, ARG327TER

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with autosomal dominant
progressive external ophthalmoplegia-5 (PEOA5; 613077), Tyynismaa et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous 979C-T transition in the last exon of
the RRM2B gene, resulting in an arg327-to-ter (R327X) substitution. The
substitution was predicted to result in a protein lacking the last 25
amino acids. One family was North American of European origin, and the
second was Hungarian. The mutation was not observed in 380 control
European chromosomes, and there was no evidence of a founder effect. The
phenotype was characterized by late-onset of mild ophthalmoplegia and
mild muscle weakness. Skeletal muscle biopsies showed mtDNA deletions,
but normal mtDNA copy numbers. RNA studies showed that the R328X mRNA
escaped nonsense-mediated decay, and that the mutant protein was
expressed and stable. The findings suggested that the mutant RRM2B
protein can compete with wildtype in binding to ribonucleotide
reductase, causing a dominant-negative or gain-of-function effect.

.0007
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8A (ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIC TYPE WITH
RENAL TUBULOPATHY)
RRM2B, GLY229VAL

In 2 Sudanese brothers, born of consanguineous parents, with
encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (612075),
Kollberg et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 686G-T transversion in
exon 7 of the RRM2B gene, resulting in a gly229-to-val (G229V)
substitution in the diferric iron center of the protein. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation. The phenotype was severe, with
hypotonia, seizures, poor visual contact, and lactic acidosis, and both
patients died by 5 months of age. One boy developed a proximal renal
tubulopathy. Southern blot analysis of patient cells showed severe mtDNA
depletion, about 1 to 4% of normal controls.

.0008
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROME 8B (MNGIE TYPE)
RRM2B, ARG110HIS

In a 42-year-old woman with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome-8B,
manifest as mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome
(MNGIE; see 612075), Shaibani et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RRM2B gene: a 329G-A transition
resulting in an arg110-to-his (R110H) substitution, and a 362G-A
transition resulting in an arg121-to-his (R121H; 604712.0009)
substitution. Both mutations occurred in highly conserved residues. The
patient developed recurrent nausea, vomiting, and weight loss at age 30
years. At age 37, she developed restriction of eye movements, ptosis,
dysarthria, unsteady gait, muscle weakness, and areflexia consistent
with a peripheral neuropathy. Skeletal muscle showed mtDNA depletion
(12% of controls). Shaibani et al. (2009) noted that this was the oldest
reported patient with RRM2B mutations and that her clinical course was
different from that reported previously in patients with MNGIE. The
findings also broadened the phenotype associated with RRM2B mutations to
include an MNGIE-like picture.

RRM2B, 1-BP DEL, 950T

In 3 unrelated patients with PEOA5 (613077), Fratter et al. (2011)
identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (950delT) in the RRM2B gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination at leu317. The
patients had onset at ages 30, 53, and 46 years, and all had a family
history of the disorder. All had PEO and ptosis, but additional variable
features in 2 patients included fatigue, ataxia, proximal myopathy,
dysphagia, and glaucoma. Skeletal muscle biopsies of the probands showed
a mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase activity and multiple mtDNA
deletions. The mutation was not found in 352 control alleles.

RRM2B, 1-BP DUP, 965A

In 3 unrelated patients with PEOA5 (613077), Fratter et al. (2011)
identified a heterozygous 1-bp duplication (965dupA) in the RRM2B gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The patients had
onset at ages 30, 54, and 26 years, and all had a family history of the
disorder. All had PEO and fatigue, but additional features were variable
and included diabetes, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysphagia, dysphonia,
and proximal myopathy. Skeletal muscle biopsies of the probands showed a
mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase activity and multiple mtDNA
deletions. The mutation was not found in 352 control alleles.

.0012
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
RRM2B, PHE202LEU

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to progressive external ophthalmoplegia has not been
confirmed.

In a 14-year-old patient with early-onset progressive external
ophthalmoplegia at age 4 and hearing loss, Fratter et al. (2011)
identified compound heterozygous changes in the RRM2B gene: a 606T-A
transversion resulting in a phe202-to-leu (F202L) substitution, and an
817G-A transition resulting in a gly273-to-ser (G273S; 604712.0013)
substitution. Functional studies of the variants were not performed.
Skeletal muscle biopsy showed a mosaic defect of cytochrome c oxidase
activity and multiple mtDNA deletions. Neither variant was found in 352
control alleles, and both occurred in conserved residues. There was no
family history of a similar disorder, but information on the parents was
not provided. The findings suggested recessive inheritance of the
disorder.

.0013
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
RRM2B, GLY273SER

See 604712.0012 and Fratter et al. (2011).

.0014
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
RRM2B, PRO33SER

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to progressive external ophthalmoplegia has not been
confirmed.

In a 43-year-old Japanese man, born of consanguineous parents, with
adult-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia, Takata et al. (2011)
identified a homozygous 341G-A transition in the RRM2B gene, resulting
in a pro33-to-ser (P33S) substitution in a highly conserved residue in
the N terminus. The variant was found by whole-exome sequencing in
combination with runs of homozygosity analysis. Each unaffected parent
was heterozygous for the mutation, which was found in 1 of 718 control
chromosomes of Japanese origin. Functional studies of the variant were
not performed. The patient presented with hearing loss at age 16 years,
and later developed ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and muscle weakness. He
also had pigmentary degeneration of the retina and gonadal atrophy.
Other features included depressed mood, anxiety, and hypochondriacal
complaints. Muscle biopsy showed marked variation of fiber size,
ragged-red fibers, COX-negative fibers, and multiple mtDNA deletions.
There was no family history of a similar disorder. Mutations in other
candidate genes were excluded. Takata et al. (2011) suggested that this
was the first case of recessive inheritance of PEO due to RRM2B
mutations.

Frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial iron chaperone involved in
iron-sulfur biogenesis and heme biosynthesis. Some studies have also
suggested that frataxin functions as an iron storage molecule, an
antioxidant, and a tumor suppressor (summary by Schmucker et al.
(2008)).

CLONING

By searching the candidate region defined by analysis of recombination
events in families with Friedreich ataxia (229300), Montermini et al.
(1995) reported that they had located a 150-kb region in chromosome 9q13
that represented the FRDA locus. Campuzano et al. (1996) identified
potential exons in the region in chromosome 9q13 using cDNA selection
and sequence analysis. The FXN gene was isolated by this method and
called X25 by the authors. It encodes a 210-amino acid protein, termed
frataxin. It was shown to be expressed in a range of tissues, most
abundantly in heart. High levels of expression were also found in the
spinal cord; lower levels were detected in the cerebellum, and no
expression was demonstrated in the cerebral cortex.

Koutnikova et al. (1997) cloned the complete coding region of mouse
frataxin and studied its pattern of expression in developing and adult
tissues. Frataxin mRNA was predominantly expressed in tissues with a
high metabolic rate, including liver, kidney, brown fat, and heart. They
showed that mouse and yeast frataxin homologs contain a potential
mitochondrial targeting sequence in their N-terminal domains and that
disruption of the yeast gene results in mitochondrial dysfunction.

GENE STRUCTURE

Campuzano et al. (1996) found that the FXN gene contains 6 exons.

Baralle et al. (2008) stated that the FXN gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 80 kb. The GAA repeat, which when expanded is associated
with disease, is located in the middle of an Alu sequence in the
approximately 11-kb first intron.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Campuzano et al. (1996) mapped the FXN gene to
chromosome 9q13.

GENE FUNCTION

To study frataxin function, Campuzano et al. (1997) developed monoclonal
antibodies raised against different regions of the frataxin protein.
These antibodies detected a processed 18-kD protein in various human and
mouse tissues and cell lines that is severely reduced in Friedreich
ataxia patients. By immunocytofluorescence and immunocytoelectron
microscopy, Campuzano et al. (1997) demonstrated that frataxin is
located in mitochondria, associated with the mitochondrial membranes and
crests. Analysis of cellular localization of various truncated forms of
frataxin expressed in cultured cells and evidence of removal of an
N-terminal epitope during protein maturation demonstrated that the
mitochondrial targeting sequence is encoded by the first 20 amino acids.
Given the shared clinical features between Friedreich ataxia, vitamin E
deficiency, and some mitochondriopathies, Campuzano et al. (1997)
suggested that their data indicate that a reduction in frataxin results
in oxidative damage.

Using the yeast 2-hybrid assay (Fields and Song, 1989), Koutnikova et
al. (1998) identified mitochondrial processing peptidase-beta (MPPB;
603131) as a frataxin protein partner. In in vitro assays, MPPB bound
frataxin which is cleaved by the reconstituted MPP heterodimer. MPP
cleavage of frataxin results in an intermediate form (amino acids 41 to
210) that is processed further to the mature form. In vitro and in vivo
experiments suggested that 2 C-terminal missense mutations found in FRDA
patients, I151F (606829.0004) and G127V (606829.0005), modulate
interaction with MPP-beta, resulting in a slower maturation process at
the normal cleavage site. The slower processing rate of frataxin
carrying such missense mutations may therefore contribute to frataxin
deficiency, in addition to an impairment of its function. Similar
studies were reported by Gordon et al. (1999), with conflicting results.
They performed in vitro experiments with MPP, wildtype and I154F human
frataxin or its mutant yeast homolog, and purified mammalian or yeast
mitochondria. These authors concluded that MPP was capable of 1-step
processing of frataxin to the mature form, and that the I154F mutation
had no effect on mitochondrial import and/or maturation of frataxin.

Schmucker et al. (2008) found that the 210-amino acid FXN precursor
could be processed into several forms in vitro depending upon the assay
conditions. They determined that the physiologically relevant mature
peptide corresponds to amino acids 81 through 210, which is generated by
MPPB in 2 cleavage steps.

Ristow et al. (2000) demonstrated that overexpression of frataxin in
mammalian cells causes a Ca(2+)-induced upregulation of tricarboxylic
acid cycle flux and respiration, which, in turn, leads to an increased
mitochondrial membrane potential and results in an elevated cellular ATP
content. Thus, frataxin appears to be a key activator of mitochondrial
energy conversion and oxidative phosphorylation.

Santos et al. (2001) examined the role of frataxin in neuronal
differentiation by transfecting the P19 embryonic carcinoma cell line
with antisense or sense frataxin constructs. During retinoic
acid-induced neurogenesis of frataxin-deficient cells there was a
striking rise in cell death, while cell division remained unaffected.
However, frataxin deficiency did not affect cell survival in cells
induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Frataxin deficiency
enhanced apoptosis of retinoic acid-stimulated cells, and the number of
neuronal-like cells expressing MAP2 (157130) was dramatically reduced in
these clones. In addition, antisense clones induced to differentiate
into neuroectoderm with retinoic acid had increased production of
reactive oxygen species, and only cells noncommitted to the neuronal
lineages could be rescued by the addition of the antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine (NAC). However, NAC treatment had no effect in
increasing the number of terminally differentiated neuronal-like cells
in frataxin-deficient clones. The authors suggested that frataxin
deficiency may render cells susceptible to apoptosis after exposure to
appropriate stimuli.

Adinolfi et al. (2002) compared the properties of 3 proteins from the
frataxin family (bacterial CyaY from Escherichia coli, yeast Yfh1, and
human frataxin) as representative of organisms of increasing complexity.
The 3 proteins have the same fold but different thermal stabilities and
iron-binding properties. While human frataxin has no tendency to bind
iron, CyaY forms iron-promoted aggregates with a behavior similar to
that of yeast frataxin. Mutants produced to identify the protein surface
involved in iron-promoted aggregation demonstrated that the process is
mediated by a negatively charged surface ridge. Mutation of 3 of these
residues was sufficient to convert CyaY into a protein with properties
similar to those of human frataxin. On the other hand, mutation of the
exposed surface of the beta sheet, which contains most of the conserved
residues, did not affect aggregation, suggesting to the authors that
iron binding is a nonconserved part of a more complex cellular function
of frataxins.

Cavadini et al. (2002) showed that the mature form of human frataxin,
when expressed in E. coli, assembles into a stable homopolymer that can
bind approximately 10 atoms of iron per molecule of frataxin. As
analyzed by gel filtration and electron microscopy, the homopolymer
consists of globular particles of approximately 1 megadalton and orders
rod-shaped polymers of these particles that accumulate small
electron-dense cores. When the human frataxin precursor was expressed in
S. cerevisiae, the mitochondrially-generated mature form was separated
by gel filtration into monomer and a high molecular weight pool of
approximately 600 kD, which was also present in mouse heart. In
radiolabeled yeast cells, human frataxin was recovered by
immunoprecipitation with approximately 5 atoms of iron bound per
molecule. The authors suggested that FRDA may result from decreased
mitochondrial iron storage due to frataxin deficiency, which may impair
iron metabolism, promote oxidative damage, and lead to progressive iron
accumulation.

Shoichet et al. (2002) demonstrated that transgenic overexpression of
human frataxin in murine 3T3-L1 cells increased cellular antioxidant
defense. Subsequent activation of glutathione peroxidase and elevation
of reduced thiols reduced the incidence of malignant transformation
induced by reactive oxygen species, as observed by tumor formation in
nude mice. The authors tentatively suggested a role for frataxin
mutations in the early induction of cancer.

Tan et al. (2003) analyzed gene expression in 3 human cell types using
microarrays and identified 48 transcripts whose expression was
significantly frataxin-dependent in at least 2 cell types. Significant
decreases in 7 transcripts occurred in the sulfur amino acid (SAA)
biosynthetic pathway and the iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biosynthetic
pathway to which it is connected. Expression of ISC-S and rhodanese
(TST; 180370) transcripts was lower in mutants. Homocystine, cysteine,
cystathionine, and serine were significantly decreased in
frataxin-deficient cell extracts and mitochondria. Succinate
dehydrogenase and aconitase, whose activities require ISCs, were less
active. The ISC-U scaffold protein was specifically decreased in
frataxin-deficient cells, and sodium sulfide partially rescued the
oxidant sensitivity of the FRDA cells. Multiple transcripts involved in
the Fas (134637)/TNF (191160)/INF apoptosis pathway were upregulated in
frataxin-deficient cells, consistent with a multistep mechanism of
Friedreich ataxia pathophysiology and suggesting alternative
possibilities for therapeutic intervention.

By RNA interference (RNAi) of frataxin in HeLa cells, Stehling et al.
(2004) found that the enzyme activity of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins
aconitase (ACO1/IRP1; 100880) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA; 600857)
was decreased, while the activity of non-Fe/S proteins remained
constant. Fe/S cluster association with cytosolic IRP1 was diminished.
In contrast, no alterations in cellular iron uptake, iron content, and
heme formation were found, and no mitochondrial iron deposits were
observed upon frataxin depletion. Iron accumulation in FRDA mitochondria
appeared to be a late consequence of frataxin deficiency. Stehling et
al. (2004) concluded that frataxin is a component of the human Fe/S
cluster assembly machinery and that it plays a role in the maturation of
both mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S proteins.

Bulteau et al. (2004) found that aconitase (100850) activity can undergo
reversible citrate-dependent modulation in response to prooxidants.
Frataxin interacted with aconitase in a citrate-dependent fashion,
reduced the level of oxidant-induced inactivation, and converted the
inactive [3Fe-4S]1+ enzyme to the active [4Fe-4S]2+ form of the protein.
Bulteau et al. (2004) concluded that frataxin is an iron chaperone
protein that protects the aconitase [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster from disassembly
and promotes enzyme reactivation.

To further discern the role of oxidative stress in FRDA pathophysiology,
Seznec et al. (2005) tested the potential effect of increased
antioxidant defense using an MnSOD mimetic (SOD2; 147460) and Cu-Zn SOD
(SOD1; 147450) overexpression on murine FRDA cardiomyopathy. No positive
effect was observed, suggesting that increased superoxide production
could not solely explain the cardiac pathophysiology associated with
FRDA. Complete frataxin deficiency neither induced oxidative stress in
neuronal tissues nor altered MnSOD expression and induction in early
stages of neuronal and cardiac pathology. Cytosolic ISC aconitase
activity of IRP1 progressively decreased, whereas its apo-RNA binding
form increased despite the absence of oxidative stress, suggesting that
in a mammalian system the mitochondrial ISC assembly machinery is
essential for cytosolic ISC biogenesis. Seznec et al. (2005) concluded
that in FRDA, mitochondrial iron accumulation does not induce oxidative
stress, and FRDA is not associated with oxidative damage.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of mitochondria from human lymphoblasts
and transfected COS-7 cells, Shan et al. (2007) showed that FXN
interacted directly with several mitochondrial proteins, including the
iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis complex component ISD11 (LYRM4; 613311),
the mitochondrial chaperones HSPA9 (600548) and HSP60 (HSPD1; 118190),
the ATP synthase subunit ATP5L, the ATPase ATAD3A (612316), succinate
dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA; 600857), AFG3L2 (604581), and FXN itself.
Reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interactions of
FXN with ISD11 and HSPA9 in transfected HEK293 cells. The interaction
between FXN and ISD11 was reversed by EDTA and by several cations at
physiologic concentration, including Fe(3+). However, Ni(2+)
strengthened the interaction between FXN and ISD11. RT-PCR analysis of
lymphoblasts from Friedreich ataxia patients revealed that reduced FXN
mRNA was associated with reduced ISD11 mRNA. Shan et al. (2007) proposed
that FXN deficiency causes transcriptional corepression of genes
involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis.

Using hybrid reporter minigenes with 100 GAA or TTC repeats transfected
into COS or HeLa cells, Baralle et al. (2008) found that both repeats
were efficiently transcribed and inserted into nascent pre-mRNAs that
bound multiple splicing factors. However, the GAA repeats, but not TTC
repeats, caused aberrant splicing of the pre-mRNA. The type of aberrant
splicing depended on the position used for insertion of the GAA repeat,
and the length of the repeat affected the severity of the splicing
abnormality. GAA repeats inserted in a frataxin minigene reduced
splicing efficiency without affecting the abundance of the nascent
transcript. The pathologic expansion induced a block in the processing
of 1 splicing intermediate that accumulated in the nucleus. Baralle et
al. (2008) proposed that the block caused by GAA expansion results from
interference from multiple splicing factors bound to the nascent GAA
repeat-containing transcript, resulting in degradation of the pre-RNA
and lower abundance of mature frataxin mRNA.

To address the physiologic function of human extramitochondrial
frataxin, Condo et al. (2010) searched for ISC-dependent interaction
partners. The authors demonstrated that the extramitochondrial form of
frataxin directly interacted with cytosolic aconitase/iron regulatory
protein-1 (ACO1/IRP1; 100880), a bifunctional protein alternating
between an enzymatic and an RNA-binding function through the
'iron-sulfur switch' mechanism. The cytosolic aconitase defect and
consequent IRP1 activation occurring in FRDA cells were reversed by the
action of extramitochondrial frataxin.

- Studies Using the Yeast Frataxin Homolog

Babcock et al. (1997) characterized a gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
whose predicted gene product had high sequence similarity to the human
frataxin protein. The yeast gene (yeast frataxin homolog, YFH1) encodes
a mitochondrial protein involved in iron homeostasis and respiratory
function. Human frataxin also was shown to be a mitochondrial protein.

Wilson and Roof (1997) showed that YFH1 localizes to mitochondria and is
required to maintain mitochondrial DNA. They showed that the
YFH1-homologous domain of frataxin functions in yeast and that a
disease-associated missense mutation of this domain, or the
corresponding domain in YFH1, reduces function.

Adamec et al. (2000) expressed a mature form of the YFH1 protein in E.
coli and analyzed its function in vitro. The isolated protein is a
soluble monomer that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency
to self-associate. Aerobic addition of ferrous iron to the protein
resulted in assembly of regular spherical multimers. Each multimer
consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester more than 3,000
atoms of iron. Titration of the yeast protein with increasing iron
concentrations supported a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly.
Sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent resulted in
quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer,
indicating that the yeast frataxin protein sequesters iron in an
available form. Adamec et al. (2000) proposed that iron-dependent
self-assembly of recombinant yeast frataxin protein reflects a
physiologic role for frataxin in mitochondrial iron sequestration and
bioavailability.

Cavadini et al. (2000) showed that wildtype FRDA cDNA can complement the
YFH1 protein-deficient yeast (YFH1-delta) by preventing the
mitochondrial iron accumulation and oxidative damage associated with
loss of YFH1. The G130V mutation (606829.0005) affected protein
stability and resulted in low levels of mature frataxin, which were
nevertheless sufficient to rescue YFH1-delta yeast. The W173G
(606829.0007) mutation affected protein processing and stability and
resulted in severe mature frataxin deficiency. Expression of the FRDA
W173G cDNA in YFH1-delta yeast led to increased levels of mitochondrial
iron which were not as elevated as in YFH1-deficient cells but were
above the threshold for oxidative damage of mitochondrial DNA and
iron-sulfur centers, causing a typical YFH1-delta phenotype. The authors
concluded that frataxin functions like YFH1 protein, providing
additional experimental support for the hypothesis that FRDA is a
disorder of mitochondrial iron homeostasis.

Gordon et al. (2001) mapped the 2 cleavage sites of the YFH1 protein
precursor. Mutations blocking the first or the second cleavage of YFH1
protein did not interfere with its import from the cytoplasm or with its
ability to complement phenotypes of the YFH1-delta mutant yeast strain.
The first cleaved domain (domain I), consisting of 20 N-terminal amino
acids, was able to import a nonmitochondrial passenger fusion protein.
However, neither domain I nor other matrix-targeting signals alone could
support efficient import of mature YFH1 protein. The second cleaved
domain (domain II), consisting of an additional 31 N-terminal amino
acids, was required as a spacer between a targeting signal and mature
YFH1 protein. Likewise, when YFH1 protein constructs lacking domain I or
II were expressed in vivo, they failed to attain appreciable
steady-state amounts in mitochondria and could not complement phenotypes
of the YFH1-delta mutant.

Karthikeyan et al. (2002) found that the absence of frataxin in yeast
leads to nuclear damage, as evidenced by inducibility of a nuclear DNA
damage reporter, increased chromosomal instability including
recombination and mutation, and greater sensitivity to DNA-damaging
agents, as well as slow growth. Addition of a human frataxin mutant did
not prevent nuclear damage, although it partially complemented the YFH1
mutant in preventing mitochondrial DNA loss. The effects in YFH1 mutants
appeared to result from reactive oxygen species, since (1) YFH1 cells
produce more hydrogen peroxide, (2) the effects are alleviated by the
radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine, and (3) the glutathione peroxidase
gene (GPX1; 138320) prevents an increase in mutation rates. The authors
concluded that the frataxin protein has a protective role for the
nucleus as well as the mitochondria.

Muhlenhoff et al. (2002) constructed a yeast strain (Gal-YFH1) that
carried the YFH1 gene under the control of a galactose-regulated
promoter. Yfh1p-deficient Gal-YFH1 cells were far less sensitive to
oxidative stress than delta-yfh1 mutants, maintained mitochondrial DNA,
and synthesized heme at wildtype rates. Yfh1p depletion caused a strong
reduction in the assembly of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins, which may
explain the respiratory deficiency of Gal-YFH1 cells. Yfh1p-depleted
Gal-YFH1 cells show decreased maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins and
accumulation of mitochondrial iron, which may be seen secondary to
defects in cytosolic Fe/S protein assembly. The authors proposed a
specific role of frataxin in the biosynthesis of cellular Fe/S proteins
which excluded most of the previously suggested functions.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking the Yfh1 gene showed very low
cytochrome content. Lesuisse et al. (2003) showed that in delta-yfh1
strains, the level of ferrochelatase (612386) was very low as a result
of transcriptional repression of HEM15. However, the low amount of
ferrochelatase was not the cause of heme deficiency in delta-yfh1 cells.
Ferrochelatase, a mitochondrial protein able to mediate insertion of
iron or zinc into the porphyrin precursor, made primarily the zinc
protoporphyrin product. Yfh1p and ferrochelatase were shown to interact
in vitro by BIAcore studies. Lesuisse et al. (2003) concluded that Yfh1
mediates iron use by ferrochelatase.

Karthikeyan et al. (2003) developed a highly regulatable promoter system
for expressing frataxin in yeast to address the consequences of
chronically reduced amounts of this protein. Shutting off the promoter
resulted in changes normally associated with loss of frataxin, including
iron accumulation within the mitochondria and the induction of
mitochondrial 'petite' phenotype mutants. While there was considerable
oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins, the 'petites' were likely
due to accumulation of mitochondrial DNA lesions and subsequent DNA
loss. Chronically reduced frataxin levels resulted in similar response
patterns. Furthermore, nuclear DNA damage was detected in a rad52 (see
600392) mutant, deficient in double-strand break repair. Karthikeyan et
al. (2003) concluded that reduced frataxin levels, which may be more
representative of the disease state in Friedreich ataxia, resulted in
considerable oxidative damage in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA.

Campanella et al. (2004) expressed human mitochondrial ferritin (FTMT;
608847) in frataxin-deficient yeast cells. The human FTMT precursor was
efficiently imported by yeast mitochondria and processed to functional
ferritin that actively sequestered iron in the organelle. FTMT
expression rescued the respiratory deficiency caused by the loss of
frataxin protecting the activity of iron-sulfur enzymes and enabling
frataxin-deficient cells to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources.
Furthermore, FTMT expression prevented the development of mitochondrial
iron overload, preserved mitochondrial DNA integrity, and increased cell
resistance to H2O2. Campanella et al. (2004) concluded that FTMT can
substitute for most frataxin functions in yeast, suggesting that
frataxin may be directly involved in mitochondrial iron-binding and
detoxification.

Gonzalez-Cabo et al. (2005) showed that Yfh1 interacted physically with
succinate dehydrogenase complex subunits Sdh1 (SDHA; 600857) and Sdh2
(SDHB; 185470) of the yeast mitochondrial electron transport chain and
also with electron transfer flavoprotein complex ETF-alpha (608053) and
ETF-beta (130410) subunits from the electron transfer flavoprotein
complex. Genetic synthetic interaction experiments confirmed a
functional relationship between Yfh1 and Sdh1/Sdh2, and
coimmunoprecipitation showed physical interaction between human frataxin
and SDH1/SDH2, suggesting also a key role of frataxin in the
mitochondrial electron transport chain in humans. Gonzalez-Cabo et al.
(2005) suggested a direct participation of the respiratory chain in the
pathogenesis of Friedreich ataxia, and proposed that it be considered as
an OXPHOS disease.

Yfh1 interacts functionally and physically with Isu1 (ISCU; 611911), the
scaffold protein on which the Fe/S clusters are assembled. Leidgens et
al. (2010) generated 12 yeast Yfh1 mutants in conserved residues of the
frataxin beta-sheet. The Q129A, I130A, W131A(F), and R141A mutations,
which reside in surface-exposed residues of beta-strands, resulted in
severe cell growth inhibition on high-iron media and low aconitase
activity, indicating that Fe/S cluster biosynthesis was impaired. In
contrast, gln129, trp131, and arg141 residues (which are spatially
closely clustered) defined a patch important for protein function.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that W131A, unlike W131F, was
the sole mutation that strongly decreased the interaction with Isu1.
Leidgens et al. (2010) concluded that trp131, which is the only strictly
conserved frataxin residue in all sequenced species, appears essential
for interaction with Isu1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutation in the FXN gene has been shown to cause one form of Friedreich
ataxia (229300). Most patients with Friedreich ataxia have a GAA-repeat
expansion in the FXN gene. Delatycki et al. (1999) stated that 2% of
cases of Friedreich ataxia are due to point mutations, the other 98%
being due to expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1. They
indicated that 17 mutations had been described.

Campuzano et al. (1996) screened 184 patients with Friedreich ataxia for
point mutations by PCR amplification of exons. Three different point
mutations were found (606829.0002- 606829.0004). Seventy-nine unrelated
FRDA patients, including 5 with point mutations, were screened for the
GAA repeat expansion in the first intron (606829.0001). In the group of
74 patients without a point mutation, 71 were found to be homozygous for
expanded alleles, and 3 were heterozygous for the expanded repeat. The 5
patients shown to carry point mutations were all found to be
heterozygous for the repeat, and the repeat and the polymorphism had
different parental origin. Repeat expansions in the patients were
typically between 200 and 900 copies. In controls, the repeat expansion
varied from 7 to 22 copies.

Delatycki et al. (1998) studied FRDA mutations in 66 Australian
patients. One of 56 parents had a premutation with 1 normal allele and 1
allele of approximately 100 repeats in leukocyte DNA. His sperm showed
an expanded allele in a tight range centering on a size of approximately
320 repeats. His affected son had repeat sizes of 1,040 and 540. Of 33
other father-to-offspring transmissions, 17 showed a definite decrease
in allele size and 4 showed a decrease or no change; in 12 cases it was
not possible to say if the allele had expanded or contracted in size.
The authors stated that in all informative carrier father-to-affected
child transmissions, other than in the premutation carrier, the
expansion size decreased. Delatycki et al. (1998) concluded that
expansion of the FRDA gene occurs in 2 stages, the first during meiosis
followed by a second mitotic expansion.

Gacy et al. (1998) showed that the GAA instability in Friedreich ataxia
is a DNA-directed mutation caused by improper DNA structure at the
repeat region. Unlike CAG or CGG repeats, which form hairpins, GAA
repeats form a YRY triple helix containing non-Watson-Crick pairs. As
with hairpins, triplex mediates intergenerational instability in 96% of
transmissions. In families with Friedreich ataxia, GAA instability is
not a function of the number of long alleles, ruling out homologous
recombination or gene conversion as a major mechanism. The similarity of
mutation pattern among triple repeat-related diseases indicates that all
trinucleotide instability occurs by a common, intraallelic mechanism
that depends on DNA structure. Secondary structure mediates instability
by creating strong polymerase pause sites at or within the repeats,
facilitating slippage or sister chromatid exchange.

De Castro et al. (2000) analyzed DNA samples from a cohort of 241
patients with autosomal recessive or isolated spinocerebellar ataxia for
the GAA triplet expansion. They found 7 compound heterozygous patients.
In 4 patients, a point mutation that predicted a truncated frataxin was
detected. Three of them were associated with classic early-onset
Friedreich ataxia with an expanded GAA allele greater than 800 repeats.
The fourth patient had disease onset at the late age of 29 years with a
350-GAA repeat expansion. In 2 patients manifesting the classic
phenotype, no changes were observed by SSCP analysis. Linkage analysis
in a family with 2 affected children with an ataxic syndrome, one of
them showing heterozygosity for the GAA expansion, confirmed no linkage
to the FRDA locus. Most point mutations in compound heterozygous
Friedreich patients are null mutations. In their collection of compound
heterozygotes, clinical phenotypes seemed to be related to the GAA
repeat number in the expanded allele.

To investigate the genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic
cerebellar ataxia, Schols et al. (2000) tested for CAG/CTG trinucleotide
repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2 (SCA2; 183090), 3
(SCA3; 109150), 6 (SCA6; 183086), 7 (SCA7; 164500), 8 (SCA8; 608768),
and 12 (SCA12; 604326), and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124
patients, including 20 patients with the clinical diagnosis of multiple
system atrophy. Patients with a positive family history, atypical
Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic (secondary) ataxia were excluded.
Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10
patients with an age of onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation
was present in 9 patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of
age. The CTG repeat associated with SCA8 was expanded in 3 patients. One
patient had SCA2 attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally
transmitted, intermediate allele. Schols et al. (2000) did not identify
the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7, or SCA12 mutations in this group of idiopathic
sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected
in the multiple system atrophy subgroup. This study revealed the genetic
basis in 19% of apparently idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 was the most
frequent mutation in late-onset cerebellar ataxia. The authors concluded
that the frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in all
sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the
phenotype is atypical for Friedreich ataxia.

Sharma et al. (2002) used small-pool PCR to analyze somatic variability
among 7,190 individual FRDA molecules from peripheral blood DNA of
subjects carrying 12 different expanded alleles. Expanded alleles showed
a length-dependent increase in somatic variability, with mutation loads
ranging from 47 to 78%. There was a strong contraction bias among long
alleles (more than 500 triplets), which showed a 4-fold higher frequency
of large contractions versus expansions. Of all somatic mutations
scored, 5% involved contractions of more than 50% of the original allele
length, and 0.29% involved complete reversion to the normal/premutation
length (60 triplets or fewer). These observations contrasted sharply
with the strong expansion bias seen in CTG triplet repeats in myotonic
dystrophy (DM1; 160900). No somatic variability was detected in more
than 6000 individual FRDA molecules analyzed from 15 normal alleles (8
to 25 triplets). A premutation allele with 44 uninterrupted GAA repeats
was found to be unstable, ranging in size from 6 to 113 triplets, thus
establishing the threshold for somatic instability between 26 and 44 GAA
triplets. The authors concluded that expanded GAA alleles in Friedreich
ataxia are highly mutable and have a natural tendency to contract in
vivo, and that these properties may depend on multiple factors,
including DNA sequence, triplet-repeat length, and unknown cell
type-specific factors.

Sharma et al. (2004) reported 2 unrelated patients with late-onset
Friedreich ataxia who were compound heterozygous for a large clearly
pathogenic GAA expansion and a smaller 'borderline' GAA expansion in the
FXN gene. The first patient, who had expansions of 700 and 44 GAA
repeats, developed ataxia symptoms in her early forties. The second
patient, who had expansions of 915 and 66 GAA repeats, developed
symptoms in his late twenties. Genomic analysis of several different
tissues, including hair, skin, buccal cells, peripheral leukocytes, and
fibroblasts, showed somatic instability of both the 44 and 66 repeat
alleles. Cells from both patients showed an increase in mutation load,
the proportion of individual FRDA molecules that differed in length from
the constitutional allele by greater than 5%. Fifteen percent of the
GAA-44 and 75% of the GAA-66 cells contained alleles with greater than
66 repeats. The 53-year-old asymptomatic brother of the first patient
had alleles of 730 and 37 GAA repeats; the GAA-37 allele was somatically
stable. Sharma et al. (2004) concluded that borderline expanded FRDA
alleles ranging from 44 to 65 uninterrupted triplet repeats show somatic
variability and may result in a disease phenotype if a large enough
proportion of cells bear disease-causing expansions in pathologically
affected tissues. Thus, persons who are compound heterozygous for a
large repeat expansion and a borderline expansion have an increased risk
of disease development.

In order to gain insight into GAA triplet repeat instability, Clark et
al. (2004) analyzed all triplet repeats in the human genome. They
determined that the GAA triplet repeat has a significant tendency to
expand compared with all other triplet repeats. Eighty-nine percent of
GAA repeats of 8 or more map to the G/A islands of Alu elements, and 58%
map to Alu element poly(A) tails. Clark et al. (2004) found that only 2
other GAA repeats of 8 or more share the central Alu location seen at
the FRDA locus. Clark et al. (2004) theorized that the GAA repeat
coevolved with Alu elements during primate genomic evolution.

Pathogenic GAA repeat expansions in the FXN gene cause decreased mRNA
expression of FXN by inhibiting transcription. In peripheral blood cells
of 67 FRDA patients, Castaldo et al. (2008) used pyrosequencing to
perform a quantitative analysis of the methylation status of 5 CpG sites
located within intron 1 of the FXN gene, upstream of expanded GAA
repeats. FRDA patients had increased methylation compared to controls.
Significant differences were found for each CpG site tested, but the
largest differences were found for CpG1 and CpG2 (84.45% and 76.80%
methylation in patients compared to 19.65% and 23.34% in controls).
There was a direct correlation between triplet expansion size and
methylation at CpG1 and CpG2. In addition, a significant inverse
correlation was observed between methylation at CpG1 and CpG2 and age of
disease onset. Castaldo et al. (2008) concluded that epigenetic changes
in the FXN gene may cause or contribute to gene silencing in FRDA.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Filla et al. (1996) studied the relationship between the trinucleotide
(GAA) repeat length and clinical features in Friedreich ataxia. The
length of the FA alleles ranged from 201 to 1,186 repeat units. There
was no overlap between the size of normal alleles and the size of
alleles found in FA. The lengths of both the larger and the smaller
alleles varied inversely with the age of onset of the disorder. Filla et
al. (1996) reported that the mean allele length was significantly higher
in FA patients with diabetes and in those with cardiomyopathy. They
noted that there was meiotic instability with a median variation of 150
repeats. Isnard et al. (1997) examined the correlation between the
severity of left ventricular hypertrophy in Friedreich ataxia and the
number of GAA repeats. Left ventricular wall thickness was measured in
44 patients using M-mode echocardiography and correlated with GAA
expansion size on the smaller allele (267 to 1200 repeats). A
significant correlation was found (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001),
highlighting an important role for frataxin in the regulation of cardiac
hypertrophy.

In a study of 187 patients with autosomal recessive ataxia, Durr et al.
(1996) found that 140, with ages at onset ranging from 2 to 51 years,
were homozygous for a GAA expansion that had 120 to 1,700 repeats of the
trinucleotides. About one-quarter of the patients, despite being
homozygous, had atypical Friedreich ataxia; they were older at
presentation and had intact tendon reflexes. Larger GAA expansions
correlated with earlier age at onset and shorter times to loss of
ambulation. The size of the GAA expansions (and particularly that of the
smaller of each pair of alleles) was associated with the frequency of
cardiomyopathy and loss of reflexes in the upper limbs. The GAA repeats
were unstable during transmission. Thus, the clinical spectrum of
Friedreich ataxia is broader than previously recognized, and the direct
molecular test for the GAA expansion is useful for the diagnosis,
prognosis, and genetic counseling.

Pianese et al. (1997) presented data suggesting that (1) the FRDA GAA
repeat is highly unstable during meiosis, (2) contractions outnumber
expansions, (3) both parental source and sequence length are important
factors in variability of FRDA expanded alleles, and (4) the tendency to
contract or expand does not seem to be associated with particular
haplotypes. Thus, they concluded that FRDA gene variability appears to
be different from that found with other triplet diseases.

Bidichandani et al. (1997) found an atypical FRDA phenotype associated
with a remarkably slow rate of disease progression in a Caucasian
family. It was caused by compound heterozygosity for a G130V missense
mutation (606829.0005) and the GAA expansion of the X25 gene. The
missense mutation G130V was the second mutation to be identified in the
X25 gene and the first to be associated with a variant FRDA phenotype.
This and the other reported missense mutation (I154F; 229300.0004)
mapped within the highly conserved sequence domain in the C terminus of
the frataxin gene. Since the G130V mutation was unlikely to affect the
ability of the first 16 exons of the neighboring STM7 gene to encode a
functional phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase, Bidichandani et al.
(1997) questioned the role of STM7 in Friedreich ataxia.

Since Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disease, it does not
show typical features observed in other dynamic mutation disorders, such
as anticipation. Monros et al. (1997) analyzed the GAA repeat in 104 FA
patients and 163 carrier relatives previously defined by linkage
analysis. The GAA expansion was detected in all patients, most (94%) of
them being homozygous for the mutation. They demonstrated that clinical
variability in FA is related to the size of the expanded repeat: milder
forms of the disease (late-onset FA and FA with retained reflexes) were
associated with shorter expansions, especially with the smaller of the 2
expanded alleles. Absence of cardiomyopathy was also associated with
shorter alleles. Dynamics of the GAA repeat were investigated in 212
parent-offspring pairs. Meiotic instability showed a sex bias:
paternally transmitted alleles tended to decrease in a linear way that
depended on the paternal expansion size, whereas maternal alleles either
increased or decreased in size. All but 1 of the patients with
late-onset FA were homozygous for the GAA expansion; the exceptional
individual was heterozygous for the expansion and for another unknown
mutation. All but 1 of the FA patients with retained reflexes exhibited
an axonal sensory neuropathy. However, preservation of their tendon
reflexes suggested that the physiologic pathways of the reflex arch
remained functional. A close relationship was found between late-onset
disease and absence of heart muscle disease.

Delatycki et al. (1999) studied FRDA1 mutations in FA patients from
Eastern Australia. Of the 83 people studied, 78 were homozygous for an
expanded GAA repeat, while the other 5 had an expansion in one allele
and a point mutation in the other. The authors presented a detailed
study of 51 patients homozygous for an expanded GAA repeat. They
identified an association between the size of the smaller of the 2
expanded alleles and age at onset, age into wheelchair, scoliosis,
impaired vibration sense, and the presence of foot deformity. However,
no significant association was identified between the size of the
smaller allele and cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, loss of
proprioception, or bladder symptoms. The larger allele size was
associated with bladder symptoms and the presence of foot deformity.

Gellera et al. (2007) reported 13 FA patients from 12 unrelated Italian
families who were compound heterozygous for the GAA expansion and a
small mutation in the FXN gene. Two missense and 5 frameshift or
truncating mutations were identified (see, e.g., 606829.0007;
606829.0008). In all 13 patients, there was a significant inverse
correlation between GAA size and age at onset. In 6 patients, age at
onset correlated with residual protein level, and GAA size inversely
correlated with residual protein level. Clinical data were consistent
with the hypothesis that FXN mutations are more severe than GAA
expansions. In patients with a null mutation and the GAA expansion, age
at onset was strongly dependent on the size of the expansion, indicating
that residual protein function derived from the expanded allele.

HISTORY

Duclos et al. (1993) identified a transcript containing the conserved
sequences around the D9S5 locus. The 7-kb transcript corresponded to a
gene designated X11 (APBA1; 602414) which extended at least 80 kb in a
direction opposite D9S15. The gene was expressed in the brain, including
the cerebellum, but was not detectable in several nonneuronal tissues
and cell lines. In situ hybridization of adult mouse brain sections
showed prominent expression in the granular layer of the cerebellum.
Expression was also found in the spinal cord. The cDNA contained an open
reading frame encoding a 708-amino acid sequence that showed no
significant similarity to other known proteins but contained a unique,
24-residue, putative transmembrane segment. On the basis of these
findings, Duclos et al. (1993) suggested that this 'pioneer' gene
represents the FRDA gene. Further studies by Rodius et al. (1994)
excluded X11 as a candidate for the Friedreich ataxia gene.

Carvajal et al. (1995) reported the isolation of a gene from the FRDA
critical region. Although no evidence of mutation was detected in the
transcript, the sequence, which they designated STM7 (602745),
represented only one of the shorter alternatively spliced species
identified by Northern analysis and direct sequencing. Carvajal et al.
(1995) still considered the gene a strong candidate for FRDA. Carvajal
et al. (1996) reported that the X25 gene (frataxin-encoding gene)
described by Campuzano et al. (1996) comprises part of STM7. They
reported that the transcription of both STM7 and X25 occurs from the
centromere toward the telomere, that the reported sequences of STM7 and
X25 did not represent a full-length transcript, that multiple
transcripts for each of these genes are present in Northern blots, and
that several of these transcripts are of similar size. Carvajal et al.
(1996) also reported that less than 10 kb separates the CpG island
identified in the X25/exon 1 from the 3-prime end of STM7/exon 16. They
further demonstrated that the recombinant protein corresponding to the
STM7.1 transcript has phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase
activity. They noted that the ataxia-telangiectasia gene (607585) has
C-terminal similarity to the catalytic domains of phosphatidylinositol
phosphate 3-kinases. This homology, and the observation by Matsumoto et
al. (1996) of an ataxia phenotype in mice lacking the type 1
inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (147265), provided support for a
defect in the phosphoinositide pathway constituting the pathogenetic
basis of Friedreich ataxia.

Cossee et al. (1997) concluded that there was no strong argument for a
role of STM7 in Friedreich ataxia, while the presence of mutations in
the frataxin gene fulfilled all criteria required of the FRDA gene. In
reply, Chamberlain et al. (1997) presented additional data and stated
the opinion that 'Cossee et al. have failed to present either a
plausible explanation for our original observations or a definitive
argument to contradict our interpretation of the data.' In rebuttal,
Pandolfo (1997) pointed out that no data have been presented showing the
existence of STM7/frataxin transcripts with methods other than RT-PCR,
the existence of a defect in PIP kinase activity in Friedreich patients,
or the existence of disease-causing mutations in STM7. In a review
article, Koenig and Mandel (1997) stated that there was strong evidence
negating the claim that the frataxin exons are alternative 3-prime STM7
exons, namely, the structure of frataxin cDNAs and mouse intronless
pseudogenes, the nature of point mutations found in some patients, and
the size of the endogenous frataxin protein.

ANIMAL MODEL

Koutnikova et al. (1997) cloned the complete coding region of mouse
frataxin and studied its pattern of expression in developing and adult
tissues. They found by in situ hybridization analyses that mouse
frataxin expression correlated well with the main site of
neurodegeneration in Friedreich ataxia, but the expression pattern was
broader than expected from the pathology of the disease. Frataxin mRNA
was predominantly expressed in tissues with a high metabolic rate,
including liver, kidney, brown fat, and heart. They showed that mouse
and yeast frataxin homologs contain a potential mitochondrial targeting
sequence in their N-terminal domains and that disruption of the yeast
gene results in mitochondrial dysfunction.

Cossee et al. (2000) generated a mouse model of Friedreich ataxia by
deletion of exon 4 of the Frda gene, leading to inactivation of the Frda
gene product. Homozygous deletions caused embryonic lethality a few days
after implantation; no iron accumulation was observed during embryonic
resorption, suggesting that cell death may be due to a mechanism
independent of iron accumulation. The authors suggested that the milder
phenotype in humans may be due to residual frataxin expression
associated with the expansion mutations.

Through a conditional gene targeting approach, Puccio et al. (2001)
generated in parallel a striated muscle frataxin-deficient mouse line
and a neuron/cardiac muscle frataxin-deficient line, which Seznec et al.
(2004) showed that in frataxin-deficient mice, Fe-S enzyme deficiency
occurred at 4 weeks of age, prior to cardiac dilatation and concomitant
development of left ventricular hypertrophy, while mitochondrial iron
accumulation occurred at a terminal stage. The antioxidant idebenone
delayed the cardiac disease onset, progression and death of
frataxin-deficient animals by 1 week, but did not correct the Fe-S
enzyme deficiency. The authors concluded that frataxin is a necessary,
albeit nonessential, component of the Fe-S cluster biogenesis, and that
idebenone acts downstream of the primary Fe-S enzyme deficit.

Thierbach et al. (2005) disrupted expression of frataxin specifically in
murine hepatocytes to generate mice with impaired mitochondrial function
and decreased oxidative phosphorylation. These animals had a reduced
life span and developed multiple hepatic tumors. Livers also showed
increased oxidative stress, impaired respiration, and reduced ATP levels
paralleled by reduced activity of iron-sulfur cluster (Fe/S)-containing
proteins, which all led to increased hepatocyte turnover by promoting
both apoptosis and proliferation. Accordingly, phosphorylation of the
stress-inducible p38 MAP kinase (600289) was specifically impaired
following disruption of frataxin. The authors hypothesized that frataxin
may act as a mitochondrial tumor suppressor protein in mammals.

Schoenfeld et al. (2005) microarrayed murine frataxin-deficient heart
tissue, liver tissue, and cardiocytes and observed a transcript
downregulation to upregulation ratio of nearly 2:1 with a mitochondrial
localization of transcriptional changes. Combining all mouse and human
microarray data for frataxin-deficient cells and tissues, the most
consistently decreased transcripts were mitochondrial coproporphyrinogen
oxidase (CPOX; 121300) of the heme pathway and mature T-cell
proliferation 1, a homolog of yeast COX23, which is thought to function
as a mitochondrial metallochaperone. Quantitative RT-PCR studies
confirmed the significant downregulation of Isu1 (ISCU; 611911), CPOX,
and ferrochelatase at 10 weeks in mouse hearts. Mutant cells were
resistant to aminolevulinate-dependent toxicity, and there was increased
cellular protoporphyrin IX levels, reduced mitochondrial heme a and heme
c levels, and reduced activity of cytochrome oxidase, suggesting a
defect between protoporphyrin IX and heme a. Fe-chelatase activities
were similar in mutants and controls, whereas Zn-chelatase activities
were slightly elevated in mutants, supporting the idea of an altered
metal-specificity of ferrochelatase. The authors suggested that frataxin
deficiency may cause defects late in the heme pathway. Since ataxic
symptoms occur in other diseases of heme deficiency, the authors
suggested that the heme defect observed in frataxin-deficient cells
could be primary to the pathophysiological process.

Anderson et al. (2005) used RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the
Drosophila frataxin homolog (Dfh) and observed. distinct phenotypes in
larvae and adults, leading to giant long-lived larvae and to conditional
short-lived adults. Drosophila frataxin silencing differentially
dysregulated ferritin expression in adults but not in larvae, Silencing
of Dfh in the peripheral nervous system, a specific focus of Friedreich
pathology, permitted normal larval development but imposed a marked
reduction in adult life span. In contrast, Dfh silencing in motor
neurons had no deleterious effect in either larvae or adults. Finally,
overexpression of Sod1 (147450), Sod2 (147460), or Cat (115500) did not
suppress the failure of Dfh-deficient flies to successfully complete
eclosion, suggesting a minimal role of oxidative stress in this
phenotype.

Clark et al. (2007) found that transgenic mice carrying expanded human
FXN GAA repeats (190 or 82 triplets) showed tissue-specific and
age-dependent somatic instability specifically in the cerebellum and
dorsal root ganglia. The GAA(190) allele showed some instability by 2
months and significant expansion by 12 months, slightly greater than
that of GAA(82), suggesting that somatic instability was also repeat
length-dependent. There were lower levels of repeat expansion in
proliferating tissues, indicating that DNA replication per se was
unlikely to be a major cause of age-dependent expansion.

Anderson et al. (2008) showed that ectopic expression of H2O2 scavengers
suppressed the deleterious phenotypes associated with frataxin
deficiency in a Drosophila model of FRDA. In contrast, augmentation with
superoxide scavengers had no effect. Augmentation of endogenous catalase
(CAT; 115500) restored the activity of reactive oxygen species-sensitive
mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2; 100850) and enhanced resistance to H2O2
exposure, both of which were diminished by frataxin deficiency. Anderson
et al. (2008) concluded that H2O2 is an important pathologic substrate
underlying the phenotypes arising from frataxin deficiency in
Drosophila.

Coppola et al. (2009) performed microarray analysis of heart and
skeletal muscle in a mouse model of frataxin deficiency, and found
molecular evidence of increased lipogenesis in skeletal muscle, and
alteration of fiber-type composition in heart, consistent with insulin
resistance and cardiomyopathy, respectively. Since the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG; 601487) pathway is known
to regulate both processes, the authors hypothesized that dysregulation
of this pathway could play a key role in frataxin deficiency. They
demonstrated a coordinate dysregulation of the PPARG coactivator Pgc1a
(PPARGC1A; 604517) and transcription factor Srebp1 (SREBF1; 184756) in
cellular and animal models of frataxin deficiency, and in cells from
FRDA patients, who have marked insulin resistance. Genetic modulation of
the PPAR-gamma pathway affected frataxin levels in vitro, supporting
PPAR-gamma as a potential therapeutic target in FRDA.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA WITH RETAINED REFLEXES, INCLUDED
FXN, (GAA)n EXPANSION

GAA triplet repeat expansions between 200 and 900 copies in the first
intron of the frataxin gene occurred in 71 of 74 FRDA (229300) patients
studied by Campuzano et al. (1996). In unaffected individuals, the
triplet repeat expansion numbered between 7 and 20 units.

Among 101 FRDA patients homozygous for GAA expansion within the X25
gene, Coppola et al. (1999) found that 11 patients from 8 families had
FRDA with retained reflexes in the lower limbs (FARR; see 229300). The
mean size of the smaller allele was significantly less (408 +/- 252 vs
719 +/- 184 GAA triplets) in FARR patients.

.0002
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, LEU106TER

In 2 affected members of a French family with Friedreich ataxia
(229300), Campuzano et al. (1996) identified compound heterozygosity for
the FRDA expansion repeat (606829.0001) and a T-to-G transversion in
exon 3 that changed a leucine (TTA) to a stop (TGA). The L106X mutation
came from the father; the other allele carrying the expansion was from
the mother.

.0003
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, IVS3, A-G, -2

Campuzano et al. (1996) found compound heterozygosity in a member of a
Spanish family with Friedreich ataxia (229300) for the FRDA expansion
repeat (606829.0001) and an A-to-G transition which disrupted the
acceptor splice site at the end of the third intron.

.0004
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, ILE154PHE

Campuzano et al. (1996) studied 5 patients with Friedreich ataxia
(229300) from 3 different Italian families and identified a change from
isoleucine-154 to phenylalanine in exon 4. These patients were
heterozygous for the FRDA expansion repeat (606829.0001). This I154F
mutation was found to occur in 1 out of 417 chromosomes examined from
the same Southern Italian population. Isoleucine at this position was
highly conserved across species. (Koutnikova et al. (1998) referred to
this mutation as ILE151PHE.)

Shan et al. (2007) showed that the I145F mutation did not affect FXN
protein expression following transfection of HEK293T cells. However,
I145F interfered with the interaction of FXN with ISD11 (LYRM4; 613311).

.0005
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, GLY130VAL

Bidichandani et al. (1997) found compound heterozygosity for the GAA
triplet-repeat expansion (606829.0001) and a novel missense mutation,
G130V, in 3 sibs with variant Friedreich ataxia (229300). Three of 6
sibs were affected: a male age 42, a male age 39, and a female age 35.
Onset of disease was in the early teens, starting with weakness in the
lower limbs and followed by gradual progression over the ensuing 20
years. Two brothers were still ambulatory, using either a walking stick
or walker, and led fully productive working lives. Their upper limbs
were affected to a lesser extent than their legs and lacked several key
signs. They had sensory loss over the distal limbs, mild to moderate
motor weakness, impaired position and vibratory sense, and hypo- or
areflexia. Bilateral Babinski sign was also present in 1 brother. There
was no atrophy, and muscle tone was normal. Notably, there was no
dysarthria, and coordination was either very mildly affected or normal.
Nerve conduction studies revealed slowing of motor-conduction velocities
and absent sensory-evoked responses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
revealed cervical spinal cord atrophy. No cardiac abnormalities were
detected. Blood glucose levels were borderline elevated, and mild
glucose intolerance was revealed in a 5-hour glucose-tolerance test. The
sister was somewhat more physically incapacitated than her older 2
brothers. (Koutnikova et al. (1998) referred to this mutation as
GLY127VAL.)

By haplotype analysis in the 4 families that had been described with the
G130V mutation, Delatycki et al. (1999) found results suggesting a
common founder.

Using transfected HEK293T cells, Shan et al. (2007) showed that the
G130V mutation interfered with FXN protein expression.

.0006
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, MET1ILE

In 3 independent families, Zuhlke et al. (1998) found that affected
individuals with Friedreich ataxia (229300) were compound heterozygotes
for the repeat expansion (606829.0001) and an ATG-to-ATT (met1-to-ile;
M1I) mutation of the start codon of the FXN gene. Haplotype analysis
using 6 polymorphic chromosome 9 markers showed complete identity of
haplotype in 2 of the 3 chromosomes with the point mutation; the third
case showed partial conformity and may represent a single recombination
event. A common ancestor was suspected. An M1I start codon mutation has
been described in the HBB gene (141900.0430) as the cause of
beta-0-thalassemia, in the OAT gene (258870.0001) as the cause of gyrate
atrophy, in the PAH gene (261600.0048) as the cause of phenylketonuria,
and in the PLP gene (312080.0015) as the cause of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher
disease, but in all of these instances the nucleotide change represented
an ATG-to-ATA transition.

.0007
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, TRP173GLY

In 2 unrelated patients with Friedreich ataxia (229300), Cossee et al.
(1999) identified a TGG-to-GGG change in exon 5a of the FXN gene,
resulting in a trp173-to-gly (W173G) substitution.

Gellera et al. (2007) identified a 517T-G transversion, resulting in a
W173G substitution, in compound heterozygosity with the GAA expansion
(606829.0001) in FA patients from 3 unrelated families of Italian
origin. All patients had a severe form of the disorder with relatively
early onset and presence of cardiomyopathy.

Using transfected HEK293T cells, Shan et al. (2007) showed that the
W173G mutation interfered with FXN protein expression.

.0008
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, 1-BP DEL, 157C

Gellera et al. (2007) identified a 1-bp deletion (157delC) in the FXN
gene in compound heterozygosity with the GAA expansion (606829.0001) in
patients with Friedreich ataxia (229300) from 4 unrelated families of
Italian origin. The 1-bp deletion resulted in a frameshift and premature
termination of the protein at codon 75. Three of the patients who had
greater than 700 repeat expansions had onset by age 10 years. The fourth
patient, with 170 repeats, had onset at age 32 years.

.0009
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, 6-BP DEL/15-BP INS, NT371

In 2 sibs with a rapidly progressive and severe Friedreich ataxia
(229300), Evans-Galea et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity
for a GAA expansion of 1,010 repeats in the FXN gene (606829.0001) and a
deletion-insertion mutation in exon 3 (c.371_376del6ins15). The
deletion-insertion mutation was predicted to change amino acid positions
124 through 127 from DVSF to VHLEDT, increasing frataxin from 211 to 214
residues. The mutant protein, if expressed, would have an altered acidic
patch, impairing the interaction of FXN with iron and with the
iron-sulphur cluster assembly factor. One sib had onset at age 4 years
and was wheelchair-bound by age 8. The other had onset at age 5 years
and was wheelchair-bound by age 10. Both had hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, dysarthria, kyphoscoliosis, decreased joint range,
spasticity, and reduced hand function. Other features included diabetes
mellitus and abnormal ocular function. One patient died at age 20 years.

613620	TITLE *613620 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 10B; TBC1D10B
;;RAB27AGAP-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Small G proteins of the RAB family (see 179508) function in
intracellular vesicle trafficking by switching from the GTP-bound state
to the GDP-bound state with the assistance of guanine nucleotide
exchange factors (GEFs; see 609700) and GTPase-activating proteins
(GAPs). TBC1D10B functions as a GAP for several proteins of the Rab
family (Ishibashi et al., 2009).

CLONING

By database analysis, Itoh and Fukuda (2006) determined that the deduced
533-amino acid TBC1D10B protein, which they called RAB27AGAP-beta,
contains a central TRE2 (USP6; 604334)/yeast Bub2/CDC16 (603461) (TBC)
domain and a C-terminal DAYF motif. The TBC domain is predicted to
function as a RabGAP, and the DAYF motif is predicted to interact with
PDZ domains. TBC1D10B shares highest sequence similarity with EPI64
(TBC1D10A; 610020). The TBC domains of TBC1D10B and TBC1D10A are 81%
identical, and both contain a highly conserved catalytic arginine.
Fluorescence-tagged TBC1D10B localized to the plasma membrane of
transfected mouse melanoma cells.

Ishibashi et al. (2009) found that fluorescence-tagged TBC1D10B
localized near the plasma membrane of differentiated rat PC12
pheochromocytoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening human and mouse cDNAs encoding putative RabGAPs for the
ability to catalyze GTP exchange in Rab proteins, Itoh and Fukuda (2006)
found that both TBC1D10A and TBC1D10B functioned as GAPs for mouse
Rab27a (603868) and induced melanosome aggregation in a mouse melanocyte
cell line. Both TBC1D10A and TBC1D10B increased the GTPase activity of
Rab27a and reduced the amount of GTP-Rab27a when coexpressed with
Rab27a.

Endogenous Rab3a (179490) is present on dense-core vesicles in the
distal portion of neurites in differentiated rat PC12 cells. By
overexpressing TBC1D10B in PC12 cells, Ishibashi et al. (2009) found
that TBC1D10B functioned as a GAP for Rab3a, reducing association of
Rab3a with neurites. Mutation of the catalytic arg134 in the TBC domain
of TBC1D10B completely inhibited its GAP activity against Rab3a in PC12
and transfected COS-7 cells. TBC1D10B also showed significant GAP
activity toward Rab22a (612966), Rab27a, and Rab35 (604199), but not
Rab2a (RAB2; 179509) or Rab6a (179513).

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the TBC1D10B gene to chromosome 16p11.2 based on an
alignment of the TBC1D10B sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC063112) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

601426	TITLE *601426 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR SUBFAMILY 2, GROUP C, MEMBER 2; NR2C2
;;NUCLEAR HORMONE RECEPTOR TR4 TESTICULAR NUCLEAR RECEPTOR 4; TR4;;
TAK1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, such as NR2C2, act as
ligand-activated transcription factors. The proteins have an N-terminal
transactivation domain, a central DNA-binding domain with 2 zinc
fingers, and a ligand-binding domain at the C terminus. The activated
receptor/ligand complex is translocated to the nucleus where it binds to
hormone response elements of target genes (Yoshikawa et al., 1996).

CLONING

Chang et al. (1994) cloned NR2C2, or TR4, a member of the nuclear
hormone receptor superfamily, using degenerate PCR on RNA from the
supraoptic nucleus of the brain with primers based on the conserved
DNA-binding domain of these genes. They isolated TR4 cDNAs from both
human and rat libraries. The cDNAs encode a predicted 615-amino acid
human protein and a 596-amino acid rat protein that are 98% identical.
The TR4 sequence is similar to that of the TR2 orphan receptor (Chang et
al., 1994). Together they appear to form a distinct subfamily.

Hirose et al. (1994) cloned the TR4 gene, which they designated TAK1,
from a human lymphoblastoma cDNA library. They stated that the predicted
protein is 596 amino acids long. On SDS-PAGE, TR4 migrated as a 65-kD
protein. Using Northern blot analysis, Hirose et al. (1994) found that
TR4 is expressed as a 9.4-kb mRNA in many tissues, and as a 2.8-kb mRNA
primarily in testis. The 2 transcripts appeared to differ in the length
of the 3-prime untranslated region. In mouse and rat testis, TR4 was
expressed most abundantly in spermatocytes.

Yoshikawa et al. (1996) used RT-PCR to show that in rat and human, 2
isoforms (with and without a 19 codon exon) could be detected; in human,
they were both expressed widely in tissues including brain, placenta,
and ovary. However, in the PA1 human ovarian cancer cell line only the
short form was detected. The difference in cDNA length is a consequence
of alternative splicing.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakajima et al. (2004) stated that TAK1 binds as a homodimer to direct
repeats of the consensus sequence AGGTCA. They identified TIP27 (JAZF1;
606246) as a repressor of TAK1 transcriptional activity. Yeast and
mammalian 2-hybrid analyses revealed that TIP27 interacted with TAK1,
but not with other nuclear receptors, either in the presence or absence
of their respective ligands. Protein pull-down and immunoprecipitation
analyses confirmed the interaction between TAK1 and TIP27. Deletion
analysis revealed that an N-terminal domain of TIP27 interacted with a
portion of the ligand-binding domain of TAK1. Reporter gene assays
showed that TIP27 repressed TIP1 transcriptional activity in a
dose-dependent manner. TIP27 did not interfere with TIP1
homodimerization or with binding of TIP1 to DNA, suggesting that
interaction of TIP27 with TAK1 may inhibit recruitment of a coactivator.

MAPPING

Yoshikawa et al. (1996) mapped the human NR2C2 gene to chromosome 3
using a somatic cell hybrid panel and refined the localization to 3p25
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Collins et al. (2004) found that Nr2c2-null mice were born at lower than
mendelian ratios, with a significantly lower proportion of female than
male knockout mice. A growth defect was apparent early in postnatal life
in affected mice, and their fertility was greatly reduced. Additionally,
female mice lacking Nr2c2 exhibited behavioral abnormalities, including
defects in maternal behavior.

Independently, Mu et al. (2004) found that Tr4 -/- mice were smaller
than wildtype. Tr4 -/- mice exhibited varying degrees of behavioral
defects, such as hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli. Male
fertility was reduced in Tr4 -/- mice and was associated with delayed
spermatogenesis and decreased sperm production.

Chen et al. (2005) reported that behavioral abnormalities in Tr4 -/-
mice included mild trembling, unsteady gait, hyperreactivity upon
manipulation, hind limb grasping, decreased tendency to explore
surroundings, and impaired motor coordination and balance. Histologic
examination of postnatal Tr4 -/- cerebellum revealed gross abnormalities
in foliation, with loss of lobule VII in the anterior vermis.
Laminations of Tr4 -/- cerebellar cortex were abnormal, and Purkinje
cells showed aberrant dendritic arborization and loss of calbindin (see
CALB1, 114050) staining. Developing Tr4 -/- cerebellum exhibited reduced
expression of genes involved in cerebellar morphologic development.

130500	TITLE *130500 ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN BAND 4.1; EPB41
;;PROTEIN 4.1, RED BLOOD CELL TYPE; 4.1R;;
EL1 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Conboy et al. (1986) reported the molecular cloning and characterization
of human erythrocyte protein 4.1 cDNA and the complete amino acid
sequence of the protein. Probes prepared from the cloned erythrocyte
protein 4.1 cDNA hybridized with distinct mRNA species from a wide
variety of nonerythroid tissues, including brain, liver, placenta,
pancreas, and intestine, implying substantial homology between erythroid
and nonerythroid protein 4.1. Brain protein 4.1, also known as synapsin
I (313440), is the best characterized of the nonerythroid forms.

Tang et al. (1988) compared nucleotide sequences of mRNA encoding
erythroid and lymphoid protein 4.1 isoforms. The lymphoid protein 4.1
isoforms exhibited several nucleotide sequence motifs that appeared
either to be inserted into or deleted from the mRNA by alternative
splicing of a common mRNA precursor. One of the motifs, located within
the spectrin-actin binding domain, was found only in erythroid cells and
was specifically produced during erythroid cell maturation. Conboy et
al. (1988) demonstrated that alternative splicing accounts for multiple
isoforms of protein 4.1 in red cells. In his Figure 2, Conboy (1993)
provided a map of the alternative splicing of protein 4.1 mRNA,
emphasizing the total chromosome relative to many combinatorial splicing
possibilities among the exons of the EPB41 gene. There are, furthermore,
2 AUG initiation codons, 1 of which accounts for an N-terminal extension
on the 80-kD gene product.

By tissue screening, Baklouti et al. (1997) examined the complex pattern
of alternative splicing variants of the protein 4.1 gene. They noted
that many splicing variations occur in the spectrin/actin binding (SAB)
domain. In particular, they found a 51-bp exon that was expressed almost
exclusively in muscle.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Baklouti et al. (1997) determined that 22
exons spanning approximately 200 kb contain the entire erythroid and
nonerythroid coding sequences of the human protein 4.1 gene.

MAPPING

The protein 4.1 gene was mapped to chromosome 1pter-p32 (Conboy et al.,
1985, 1986) by hybridization to chromosomes sorted onto nitrocellulose
filters using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Studies of
translocations also localized the gene to chromosome 1pter-p32, the
region of the Rh gene (Kan, 1986). Thus, it seemed certain that the
protein 4.1 gene is mutant in Rh-linked elliptocytosis-1 (EL1; 611804).

Tang and Tang (1991) concluded that the EL1 gene is located in band
1p34.2-p33 on the basis of the FLpter value (the fractional length of
the total chromosome relative to the terminus of the short arm).

Parra et al. (1998) stated that the EPB41 gene is located on chromosome
1p33-p32.

Bahary et al. (1991) assigned the mouse Epb41 gene to chromosome 4.

GENE FUNCTION

The red cell membrane cytoskeletal network consists of spectrin (bands 1
and 2; see 182860 and 182870), actin (band 5; see 102630), and protein
4.1. Actin and protein 4.1 interact with spectrin at the junction of
spectrin heterotetramers. The resulting complex plays a critical role in
erythrocyte shape and deformability. (The protein band nomenclature
given here is that of Fairbanks et al., 1971.) Correas et al. (1986)
determined the complete primary structure of the functional site of
protein 4.1 involved in spectrin-actin associations. Antibodies against
2 different synthetic peptides of this portion of the protein inhibited
association between protein 4.1, spectrin, and actin.

Ponthier et al. (2006) stated that the 4.1R protein in early erythroid
progenitors, derived from transcripts in which exon 16 is skipped,
exhibits low affinity for spectrin and actin. In contrast, late-stage
erythroblasts include exon 16 and express a high-affinity isoform. This
stage-specific repression of exon 16 inclusion is mediated in part by
the binding of HNRNPA/B (602688) proteins to exonic splicing silencer
elements located within the exon. Ponthier et al. (2006) also found that
FOX1 (A2BP1; 605104) and FOX2 (RBM9; 612149) stimulate exon 16 splicing
into a 4.1R pre-mRNA minigene via specific binding to UGCAUG splicing
enhancer motifs downstream of exon 16.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Conboy et al. (1986) showed by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA
from an Algerian family that in affected members the mutant protein 4.1
gene had a DNA rearrangement upstream from the initiation codon for
translation. The mRNA from the mutant gene was aberrantly spliced.

Lambert et al. (1988) reported an elliptocytosis family in which an
apparent rearrangement of the coding region of the protein 4.1 gene led
to restriction fragment length polymorphism when DNA was tested using a
fragment of the cDNA that encompassed the coding region of the gene.

McGuire et al. (1988) described a distinct variant of protein 4.1 in
each of 3 families with elliptocytosis. Affected members of family C, of
Italian ancestry, had red cells with reduced content of protein 4.1 of
normal molecular mass (approximately 80 kD).

EVOLUTION

Tan et al. (2005) found that the EPB41 and EPB41L3 (605331) genes from
fish, bird, amphibian, and mammalian genomes exhibit shared features,
including alternative first exons and differential splicing acceptors in
exon 2. In all cases, the most 5-prime exon, exon 1A, splices
exclusively to a weaker internal acceptor site in exon 2, skipping a
fragment designated exon 2-prime. Conversely, alternative first exons 1B
and 1C always splice to the stronger first acceptor site, retaining exon
2-prime. These correlations were independent of cell type or species of
origin. Since exon 2-prime contains a translation initiation site,
splice variants generate protein isoforms with distinct N termini. Tan
et al. (2005) calculated that coupling between upstream promoters and
downstream splicing in EPB41 and EBP41L3 has been conserved for at least
500 million years.

ANIMAL MODEL

The complex EPB41 gene on human chromosome 1p encodes a diverse family
of protein 4.1R isoforms. The prototypic 80-kD 4.1R in mature
erythrocytes is a key component of the erythroid membrane skeleton that
regulates red cell morphology and mechanical stability. To study the
function of 4.1R in nucleated cells, Shi et al. (1999) generated mice
with complete deficiency of all 4.1R protein isoforms. These 4.1R-null
mice were viable, with moderate hemolytic anemia but no gross
abnormalities. Platelet morphology and function were essentially normal.
Nonerythroid 4.1R expression patterns revealed focal expression in
specific neurons in the brain and in select cells of other major organs,
challenging the view that 4.1R expression is widespread among
nonerythroid cells.

Epb41-knockout mice have fragmented red blood cells that lack
glycophorin C (GPC; see 110750). In Epb41-null murine erythroblasts,
Salomao et al. (2010) found that GPC distributed exclusively to the
nuclei, whereas in enucleating erythroblasts from wildtype bone marrow,
GPC partitioned almost exclusively to nascent reticulocytes, with little
or no GPC observed in plasma membranes of extruding nuclei. In contrast,
glycophorin A (GPA; see 111300) partitioning was not perturbed, and GPA
sorted to nascent reticulocytes in both Epb41-null and wildtype
enucleating erythroblasts. The findings indicated that GPC deficiency in
Epb41-null erythroblasts is attributable to markedly abnormal protein
partitioning during enucleation, and suggested that reticulocytes in
hereditary elliptocytosis may differ from normal reticulocytes in their
biophysical properties of membrane cohesion or membrane deformability.
The results also showed that cytoskeletal attachments are an important
factor in regulating transmembrane protein sorting to reticulocytes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
EPB41, 318-BP DEL

This mutation was first reported by Feo et al. (1980) and Tchernia et
al. (1981) in homozygotes and heterozygotes and by Alloisio et al.
(1985) in heterozygotes. In this form of elliptocytosis (611804),
Takakuwa et al. (1986) demonstrated restitution of normal membrane
stability by incorporation of purified protein 4.1 into deficient red
cells by exchange hemolysis.

In an Algerian family with hereditary elliptocytosis caused by
deficiency of erythroid protein 4.1 (described by Tchernia et al., 1981;
defect partially characterized by Conboy et al., 1986), Conboy et al.
(1993) delineated the defect by study of erythroid and nonerythroid
cells in 1 of the homozygously affected sibs. The molecular lesion was
shown to involve deletion of the downstream AUG initiation codon in 4.1
mRNA, thus leading to the absence of protein 4.1 in red cells. In
contrast, isoforms that use the upstream AUG were detected in
nonerythroid cells, thus explaining the absence of manifestations in
other organ systems. The lesion consisted of a 318-nucleotide deletion
that encompassed the downstream AUG but left the upstream AUG intact.
Normally, multiple protein 4.1 isoforms are expressed in a variety of
tissues through complex alternative pre-mRNA splicing events, one
function of which is to regulate use of 2 alternative translation
initiation signals. Late erythroid cells express mainly the downstream
initiation site for synthesis of prototypic 80-kD isoforms; nonerythroid
cells in addition use an upstream site to encode higher molecular mass
isoform(s).

ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
PROTEIN 4.1(95)
EPB41, 369-BP DUP

In affected members of family N of Scottish-Irish descent, McGuire et
al. (1988) found heterozygosity for a high molecular weight form of
protein 4.1 at approximately 95 kD, referred to as protein 4.1(95).
Marchesi et al. (1990) described the site and nature of the insertion
resulting in protein 4.1(95) and the functional consequences of the
mutation. The elliptocytosis (611804) was mild without anemia. Protein
4.1(95) was found to contain an insertion of about 15 kD adjacent to the
spectrin/actin domain of the protein comprised, at least in part, of
repeated sequence. Conboy et al. (1990) used polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) techniques to clone and sequence mutant reticulocyte mRNAs and
correlate the duplication end points with exon boundaries of the gene.
Protein 4.1(95) mRNA was found to encode a protein with 2 spectrin/actin
binding domains by virtue of a 369-nucleotide duplication from the codon
for lys407 to that for gln529.

ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
PROTEIN 4.1(68/65)
EPB41, 240-BP DEL

In affected members of family G, of Italian descent, McGuire et al.
(1988) found heterozygosity for normal 4.1(80) and 2 low molecular
weight forms of protein 4.1 at about 68 and 65 kD, referred to as
protein 4.1(68/65). The mutation was associated with moderate
elliptocytosis (611804) and anemia. Protein 4.1(68/65) was found to lack
the entire spectrin/actin binding domain. Conboy et al. (1990)
demonstrated that protein 4.1(68/65) mRNA lacked sequences encoding the
functionally important spectrin-actin binding domain due to a
240-nucleotide deletion spanning the codons for lys407 to gly486.
Marchesi et al. (1990) described the site and nature of the deletions
resulting in protein 4.1(68/65) and the functional consequences of these
mutations.

ELLIPTOCYTOSIS 1
PROTEIN 4.1 MADRID
EPB41, MET1ARG

Dalla Venezia et al. (1992) studied homozygous hereditary elliptocytosis
(611804) in a Spanish patient whose parents were second cousins. He had
had intermittent jaundice and pallor since birth. During aplastic crisis
at the age of 31 years, the spleen was very large and was removed and
cholecystectomy for gallstones was also performed. Remarkable
hematologic improvement followed. The mother of the propositus was
healthy, although her blood smear showed elliptocytosis; the father was
deceased. Glycophorin C was sharply reduced. This finding, as in other
homozygous elliptocytosis cases, indicates that protein 4.1 stabilizes
glycophorin C (110750) in the membrane. Spectrin and actin were
slightly, yet significantly, diminished. Dalla Venezia et al. (1992)
demonstrated an abnormality in 4.1 cDNA, specifically an AUG-to-AGG
transversion in the downstream translation initiation codon, changing
methionine to arginine. No obvious disorders were noted in cell types
other than red cells or possibly sperm cells. The propositus, born in
1948, had infertility associated with azoospermia and a right
ureterocele. Whereas heterozygous 4.1(-) HE accounts for one-fourth to
one-third of all HE in Caucasians, the incidence of homozygous 4.1(-) HE
was, in the opinion of Dalla Venezia et al. (1992), lower than
anticipated. They suggested that some 4.1(-) HE alleles may not be
viable in the homozygous state by virtue of affecting all isoforms of
the protein and leaving all cells deficient in protein 4.1. This was the
first identification of a specific point mutation.

;;CALCIUM CHANNEL, L TYPE, ALPHA-1 POLYPEPTIDE, ISOFORM 5; CACNL1A5;;
CaV2.2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels are multisubunit complexes found in
the membrane of many excitable cells that regulate calcium entry (see
601011). N-type calcium channels, which control neurotransmitter release
from neurons, are dihydropyridine-insensitive and
omega-conotoxin-sensitive. The alpha-1 subunit forms the pore through
which calcium enters the cell, and is encoded by a family of at least 5
genes.

CLONING

Williams et al. (1992) cloned the neuronal alpha-1B subunit by probing
brain cDNA libraries with a rabbit probe. RT-PCR revealed 2
alternatively spliced isoforms, encoding predicted products of 2,339
(alpha-1B-1) and 2,237 (alpha-1B-2) amino acids, with 64% and 73%
identity to the rabbit gene product, respectively. Both isoforms are
transcribed only in central nervous system tissue.

MAPPING

Diriong et al. (1995) and Kim et al. (1997) mapped the CACNA1B gene to
chromosome 9q34 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Williams et al. (1992) used transient expression studies in HEK293 cells
to demonstrate that CACNA1B had N-type calcium channel activity.

Using binding and immunoprecipitation assays on adult rat cortical
tissue, Maeno-Hikichi et al. (2003) showed that the enigma-like LIM
domain protein (ENH; 605904) interacts specifically with protein kinase
C-epsilon (PRKCE; 176975) and the C terminus of CACNA1B to form a
macromolecular complex. Functional studies in Xenopus oocytes indicated
that expression of ENH resulted in increased rapid and specific
modulation of N-type calcium channels by PKCE. The authors concluded
that through interactions with a common adaptor protein, the formation
of a kinase-substrate complex is the molecular basis for the specificity
and efficiency of cellular signaling.

The CaV2.2 calcium channel interacts with and is modulated by CRMP2
(602463). Overexpression of CRMP2 leads to increased surface expression
of CaV2.2 on neurons, enhanced calcium currents, and an increase in
stimulated release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide
(CGRP; 114130) from dorsal root ganglia (summary by Brittain et al.,
2011).

ANIMAL MODEL

Kim et al. (2001) found that CaV2.2-null mice were viable and fertile
and showed normal motor coordination. CaV2.2-null mice exhibited reduced
responses to certain pain stimuli, suggesting that CaV2.2 plays a role
in pain perception at the spinal level, but not at the supraspinal
level.

Kim et al. (2009) observed elevated aggression in CaV2.2-null mice.
CaV2.2 is highly expressed in the dorsal raphe nucleus of adult rats,
and injection of an N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker into the dorsal raphe
nucleus of wildtype mice resulted in increased aggressive behavior. Kim
et al. (2009) concluded that N-type Ca(2+) channels in the dorsal raphe
nucleus have a role in the control of aggression.

In rats, Brittain et al. (2011) demonstrated that inflammatory and
neuropathic hypersensitivity can be suppressed by a synthetic 15-mer
peptide (CBD3) that uncouples Crmp2 and CaV2.2 calcium channels in
neurons. Studies in cultured neurons and spinal cord slices showed that
CBD3 peptide bound CaV2.2, interfered with the interaction of Crmp2 and
CaV2.2, and reduced channel function, as evidenced by decreased CGRP
neuropeptide release from sensory neurons and decreased excitatory
synaptic transmission in dorsal horn neurons. In rats, treatment with
CBD3 also reduced meningeal blood flow and reduced nocifensive behavior
induced by peripheral formalin injection or corneal capsaicin
application, as well as reversed neuropathic hypersensitivity produced
by an antiretroviral drug. The peptide was mildly anxiolytic without
affecting memory retrieval, sensorimotor function or depression.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the ZAS family, such as ZAS2 (HIVEP2), are large proteins
that contain a ZAS domain, a modular protein structure consisting of a
pair of C2H2 zinc fingers with an acidic-rich region and a
serine/threonine-rich sequence. These proteins bind specific DNA
sequences, including the kappa-B motif (GGGACTTTCC), in the promoters
and enhancer regions of several genes and viruses, including human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). ZAS genes span more than 150 kb and
contain at least 10 exons, one of which is longer than 5.5 kb (summary
by Allen and Wu, 2004).

CLONING

Using the DNA-binding domain of HIVEP1 (194540) as probe, Nomura et al.
(1991) cloned HIVEP2 from T-cell and umbilical vein endothelial cell
cDNA libraries. The deduced 1,833-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 202.1 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 9.5-kb
transcript in a human T-cell line and in some tumor cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Nomura et al. (1991) found that expression of HIVEP2 increased about
10-fold following mitogen or phorbol ester stimulation of the Jurkat
human T-cell line. HIVEP2 bound to the HIV enhancer and other related
sequences. Similar to HIVEP1, HIVEP2 showed higher affinity for the
major histocompatibility enhancer than for the HIV enhancer.

Dorflinger et al. (1999) showed that rodent Mibp1 bound specifically to
a TC box in the human SSTR2 (182452) promoter and could activate
transcription. Mibp1 interacted with Sef2 (TCF4; 602272) to enhance
transcription from the basal Sstr2 promoter in murine brain.

Jin et al. (2006) found that Shn2 entered the nucleus of mouse embryonic
fibroblasts upon Bmp2 (112261) stimulation and that, in cooperation with
Smad1 (601595)/Smad4 (600993) and Cebp-alpha (CEBPA; 116897), Shn2
induced the expression of Ppar-gamma-2 (PPARG; 601487), a key
transcription factor for adipocyte differentiation. Shn2 directly
interacted with both Smad1/Smad4 and Cebpa on the Pparg2 promoter. Jin
et al. (2006) concluded that Shn2-mediated BMP signaling is critical for
adipogenesis.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Shukla et al.
(2009) showed that Clic4 (606536) and Schnurri-2 interacted in cultured
mouse keratinocytes. TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180) induced association
between cytoplasmic Clic4 and Schnurri-2, leading to their translocation
to the nucleus. Knockdown of Clic4 or Schnurri-2 abrogated
TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition. Nuclear Clic4 associated with
phosphorylated Smad2 (601366) and Smad3 (603109) and protected them from
dephosphorylation by nuclear protein phosphatase-1a (PPM1A; 606108).
Direct targeting of Clic4 to the nucleus following Schnurri-2 depletion
revealed that Schnurri-2 was required for Clic4 nuclear translocation,
but not for Clic4-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis or growth
inhibition.

In mice, Staton et al. (2011) showed that repression of T-cell antigen
receptor-induced (TCR) death pathways is critical for proper
interpretation of positive selecting signals in vivo, and identified
Schnurri-2 as a crucial death dampener. Staton et al. (2011) showed that
Schnurri-2 null double-positive thymocytes inappropriately undergo
negative selection in response to positive selecting signals, thus
leading to disrupted T-cell development. Schnurri-2 null double-positive
thymocytes are more sensitive to TCR-induced death in vitro and die in
response to positive selection interactions in vivo. However,
Schnurri-2-deficient thymocytes can be positively selected when
TCR-induced death is genetically ablated. Shn2 levels increase after TCR
stimulation, indicating that integration of multiple TCR-MHC-peptide
interactions may fine-tune the death threshold. Mechanistically,
Schnurri-2 functions downstream of TCR proximal signaling components to
dampen Bax (600040) activation and the mitochondrial death pathway.
Staton et al. (2011) concluded that their findings uncover a critical
regulator of T-cell development that controls the balance between death
and differentiation.

MAPPING

Using Southern analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrid DNA with a
specific HIVEP2 cDNA probe, Sudo et al. (1992) assigned the gene to
chromosome 6 and further localized it to 6q23-q24 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization.

ANIMAL MODEL

Jin et al. (2006) found that Shn2 -/- mice were slightly smaller than
wildtype mice postnatally and at 9 weeks of age. The fat mass in Shn2
-/- mice was markedly reduced compared to wildtype mice. Other tissues,
including liver, heart, and kidney, had weights similar to wildtype
controls, and there were no gross abnormalities. There was no
significant difference in brown adipose tissue between Shn2 -/- and
wildtype mice. In culture, Shn2 -/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts did not
efficiently differentiate into adipocytes.

Jones et al. (2010) stated that Shn2 -/- mice display a modest
low-turnover osteopenia due to reduced osteoclast and osteoblast
function, whereas Shn3 (HIVEP3; 606649) -/- mice show severe
osteosclerosis due to increased osteoblast activity and elevated rate of
bone formation. Jones et al. (2010) found that Shn2 -/- Shn3 -/-
double-knockout mice displayed severe growth retardation resulting in
dwarfism and did not survive beyond 3 weeks of age. Shn2 -/- Shn3 -/-
skeletal defects were due to shortening of both axial and appendicular
skeletons, incomplete formation of thoracic vertebrae, impaired sternum
development, and shortening of proximal and distal limb bones. Increased
bone mass in Shn2 -/- Shn3 -/- mice was similar to that observed in Shn3
-/- mice and was due to elevated osteoblast activity. Complete ablation
of both Shn2 and Shn3 was necessary to perturb growth plate maturation,
whereas deletion of a single Shn3 allele was sufficient to cause
increased bone mass, which could be augmented by deletion of an Shn2
allele.

;;CREBBP-ASSOCIATED FACTOR; CAF;;
p300/CBP-ASSOCIATED FACTOR; PCAF;;
P/CAF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CBP (600140) and p300 (602700) are large nuclear proteins that bind to
many sequence-specific factors involved in cell growth and/or
differentiation, including c-jun (see 165160) and the adenoviral
oncoprotein E1A. Based on its homology to yeast GCN5, which interacts
with yeast GCN4 (a counterpart of c-Jun), Yang et al. (1996) identified
a protein, designated P/CAF, that associates with p300/CBP. P/CAF
encodes a predicted 832-amino acid protein that Yang et al. (1996)
showed by RNA blotting to be expressed in all tissues, most strongly in
heart and skeletal muscle. Yang et al. (1996) showed P/CAF to have in
vitro and in vivo binding activity with CBP and p300. P/CAF competes
with E1A for binding sites in p300/CBP. Yang et al. (1996) found that
P/CAF has histone acetyl transferase activity with core histones and
nucleosome core particles, which indicates that P/CAF plays a direct
role in transcriptional regulation.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhong et al. (1998) reported that the transcriptional activity of
NF-kappa-B is stimulated upon phosphorylation of its p65 subunit
(164014) on serine-276 by protein kinase A (PKA). The transcriptional
coactivator CBP/p300 associates with NF-kappa-B p65 through 2 sites, an
N-terminal domain that interacts with the C-terminal region of
unphosphorylated p65, and a second domain that only interacts with p65
phosphorylated on serine-276. Phosphorylation by PKA both weakens the
interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions of p65 and creates an
additional site for interaction with CBP/p300. Therefore, PKA regulates
the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa-B by modulating its interaction
with CBP/p300.

Sartorelli et al. (1999) showed that MYOD (159970) is directly
acetylated by PCAF at evolutionarily conserved lysines (positions 99,
102, and 104). Acetylated MYOD displayed an increased affinity for its
DNA target. Conservative substitutions of acetylated lysines with
nonacetylatable arginines impaired the ability of MYOD to stimulate
transcription and to induce conversion, indicating that acetylation of
MYOD is functionally critical.

To elucidate the molecular basis of assembling the multiprotein
activation complex, Demarest et al. (2002) undertook a structural and
thermodynamic analysis of the interaction domains of CBP and the
activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors (TRAM1; 601937).
Demarest et al. (2002) demonstrated that although the isolated domains
are intrinsically disordered, they combine with high affinity to form a
cooperatively folded helical heterodimer. The authors concluded that
their study uncovers a unique mechanism, which they termed 'synergistic
folding,' through which p160 coactivators recruit CBP to allow
transmission of the hormone signal to the transcriptional machinery.

Okumura et al. (2006) showed that PCAF interacted physically and
functionally with PTEN (601728). PCAF acetylated PTEN on lys125 and
lys128 within the catalytic cleft essential for phosphoinositol
phosphate specificity, and this acetylation depended on the presence of
growth factors. Reduction of endogenous PCAF in human embryonic kidney
cells using short hairpin RNA resulted in loss of PTEN acetylation in
response to growth factors, and restored PTEN- mediated downregulation
of PI3K signaling and induction of G1 cell cycle arrest.
Acetylation-resistant PTEN mutants retained the ability to regulate PI3K
and induce cell cycle arrest following PCAF overexpression.

Triboulet et al. (2007) showed that suppression of the polycistronic
miRNA cluster miR17-92 (see 609416) by HIV-1, required for efficient
viral replication, was dependent on the histone acetyltransferase Tat
cofactor PCAF. The authors concluded that their results highlighted the
involvement of the miRNA silencing pathway in HIV-1 replication and
latency.

Xenaki et al. (2008) found that PCAF functioned as a cofactor for HIF1A
(603348) in human osteosarcoma cell lines treated with desferrioxamine
(DSFX), a hypoxia-mimicking compound. PCAF and HIF1A interacted in
DSFX-treated cells, resulting in PCAF-dependent acetylation of HIF1A.
PCAF was recruited to the hypoxia response element of a subset of HIF1A
targets, including the proapoptotic gene BID (601997) and the angiogenic
gene VEGF (192240). DSFX-treated cells also showed HIF1A-dependent
apoptosis. DSFX treatment also reduced PCAF-dependent acetylation of the
tumor suppressor p53 (TP53; 191170), which directed p53 toward induction
of the cell cycle regulator p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and away from
proapoptotic p53 targets. Xenaki et al. (2008) concluded that PCAF
functions as a coordinating factor in the regulation of HIF1A-mediated
apoptosis and p53-dependent cell cycle progression.

Using mass spectrometry to identify subunits of the SPT3 (SUPT3H;
602947)-TAF9 (600822)-GCN5 (KAT2A; 602301)/PCAF acetylase (STAGA) and
ADA2A (TADA2A; 602276)-containing (ATAC) histone acetyltransferase
complexes in HeLa cells, Wang et al. (2008) showed that both complexes
could incorporate either GCN5 or PCAF as acetyltransferase. Both
complexes shared the common subunits ADA3 (TADA3; 602945) and STAF36
(CCDC101; 613374), but differed by the inclusion of several subunits,
including ADA2B (TADA2B; 608790) in STAGA and ADA2A and the scaffolding
protein YEATS2 (613373) in ATAC. Human ATAC and STAGA specifically
acetylated nucleosomal histone H3 (see 602812), and ATAC repressed
transcription of a reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner. Wang et al.
(2008) concluded that STAGA and ATAC complexes link extracellular
signals to modification of chromatin structure and regulation of the
basal transcriptional machinery.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the KAT2B gene to chromosome 3p24.3 based on an
alignment of the KAT2B sequence (GenBank GENBANK U57317) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

By linkage analysis with an interspecific backcross panel, Xu et al.
(1998) mapped the mouse Pcaf gene to the centromeric region of
chromosome 17.

600694	TITLE *600694 INTERLEUKIN 6 SIGNAL TRANSDUCER; IL6ST
;;GP130 TRANSDUCER CHAIN; GP130
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Initially described as the interleukin-6 signal transducer, gp130 is a
transducer chain shared by many cytokines, including IL6 (147620), IL11
(147681), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; 159540), oncostatin M (OSM;
165095), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; 118945), as reviewed by
Kishimoto et al. (1994). All of these cytokines act via a bi- or
tripartite receptor complex in which signaling is triggered by
homodimerization (IL6) or heterodimerization with LIF-Rb/gp190 protein
(IL11, LIF, OSM, and CNTF) of gp130. These cytokines thus mediate
similar biologic activities in various tissues. See also IL6RA (147880).

CLONING

By immunoscreening a placenta cDNA expression library with antibodies to
human gp130, followed by screening a myeloma cell line cDNA library,
Hibi et al. (1990) cloned gp130. The deduced 918-amino acid protein has
an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a 597-amino acid extracellular
region, a transmembrane domain, and a 277-amino acid cytoplasmic domain.
It also contains 14 potential N-glycosylation sites. The mature
896-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 101 kD. Part
of the extracellular region, including 4 conserved cysteines and a WSxWS
motif, shows significant homology with cytokine receptors. Gp130 is most
closely related to GCSFR (CSF3R; 138971). Both receptors contain 6
fibronectin (135600) type III modules in the extracellular region. The
intracellular domain has a consensus nucleotide-binding domain, but it
has no protein kinase catalytic domain. Four sequences in the
intracellular domain are similar to GTP-binding motifs of RAS
(190020)-related proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.0-kb
transcript in all cell lines examined. Gp130 showed an apparent
molecular mass of 130 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Saito et al. (1992) cloned mouse gp130. The deduced 917-amino acid
protein has a domain structure equivalent to that of human gp130,
including 4 conserved cysteines and the 4 GTP-binding motif-like
sequences. Mouse and human gp130 share 76.8% amino acid homology,
including 100% identity in a 116-amino acid stretch that spans the
transmembrane domain. Northern blot analysis detected 7.0- and 10.0-kb
transcripts expressed in varying ratios in all tissues examined. Lowest
expression was in spleen. During mouse embryonic development, robust
expression of both gp130 transcripts was detected on day 6, and
expression peaked on day 8.

Narazaki et al. (1993) purified 2 soluble forms of gp130 (sgp130) from
human serum. These proteins had apparent molecular masses of 90 and 110
kD.

Diamant et al. (1997) cloned sgp130 from a peripheral blood mononuclear
cell cDNA library. The deduced protein contains 624 amino acids. Diamant
et al. (1997) determined that the sgp130 transcript results from
alternative splicing and includes an 85-bp exon just before the
transmembrane-coding exon. This insertion results in a frameshift, and
the sequence following the insertion encodes 4 amino acids not found in
full-length membrane-bound gp130, followed by a stop codon 1 bp from the
transmembrane-coding region. PCR analysis detected expression of sgp130
in all myeloma cell lines tested except 1 line growing independent of
IL6 stimulation. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with
sgp130 secreted the protein into the medium. Some sgp130 was also
secreted by CHO cells transfected with cDNA encoding full-length gp130,
but at a much lower concentration. Diamant et al. (1997) concluded that
sgp130 could be generated both by shedding and by expressing an
alternatively spliced transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Hibi et al. (1990) determined that cells transfected with IL6RA
expressed mainly low-affinity IL6-binding sites. Cotransfection of gp130
cDNA increased the number of high-affinity binding sites, but gp130 did
not directly bind IL6 or several other cytokines. Mouse IL3
(147740)-dependent pre-B cells proliferated when cultured with IL6 plus
soluble IL6RA only following transfection with human gp130. Hibi et al.
(1990) concluded that gp130 is involved in the formation of
high-affinity IL6-binding sites and in IL6 signal transduction.

Murakami et al. (1991) analyzed C-terminal truncation mutants of gp130.
Mutants retaining only the last 10 amino acids of the 277-amino acid
C-terminal region proximal to the transmembrane domain were capable of
binding the IL6/IL6R complex; however, these mutants were unable to
transduce the growth signal following IL6/IL6R complex binding. Signal
transduction required a 61-amino acid region containing 2 short segments
that share homology with other cytokine receptor family members. Gp130
molecules with mutations in either of these segments could not transduce
a growth signal. Loss of signal-transducing ability coincided with loss
of IL6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130.

Saito et al. (1992) determined that administration of IL6 in mice caused
upregulation of gp130 mRNA in several tissues. In liver, both gp130 and
Il6ra mRNA were upregulated by IL6.

Narazaki et al. (1993) determined that sgp130 within human serum or
exogenous recombinant sgp130 inhibited growth of transfected mouse pre-B
cells induced by the IL6/IL6R complex. Recombinant sgp130 also inhibited
growth in erythroleukemia cells stimulated by OSM or the CNTF/CNTFR
(118946) complex in a dose-dependent manner. Recombinant sgp130 was less
inhibitory to growth induced by LIF or the IL6/IL6R complex. Narazaki et
al. (1993) concluded that sgp130 has a role in modulating signals
transduced by membrane-bound gp130.

Chow et al. (2001) noted that cytokines that activate gp130 share a
common 4-helix bundle fold and that gp130 recognition of ligands occurs
through its cytokine-binding homology region, located at domains 2 and
3. In addition, activation occurs through a separate N-terminal, Ig-like
domain (domain 1). Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, or
HHV-8) encodes a functional homolog of IL6 (termed vIL6; 25% sequence
homology) that is expressed in KSHV-infected cells and is able to induce
angiogenesis and hematopoiesis in IL6-dependent cell lines. In contrast
to IL6, which binds to gp130 only after it forms a complex with IL6RA,
vIL6 directly activates gp130. By crystal structure analysis, Chow et
al. (2001) demonstrated that in the extracellular signaling assembly
between vIL6 and gp130, 2 complexes are cross-linked into a tetramer
through direct interactions between the Ig domain of gp130 and site III
of vIL6, which is necessary for gp130 activation. Unlike IL6, vIL6 uses
mainly hydrophobic residues to contact gp130, enhancing the
complementarity of the vIL6-gp130 binding interfaces. Identical
positions of 2 disulfide bonds in IL6 and vIL6 and the high conservation
of the hydrophobic core residues account for the reproduction of the
helical scaffold by vIL6, enabling gp130 contact.

Pflanz et al. (2004) found that transfection of WSX1 (605350) into a
cell line expressing gp130 but only low levels of WSX1 resulted in IL27
(see 605816)-dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 (600555) and STAT3
(102582). In addition, they showed that anti-gp130 blocked IL27-mediated
cellular effects. Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that, in addition
to naive CD4 (186940)-positive T cells, numerous cell types expressed
both gp130 and WSX1, including mast cells. IL27 stimulation of mast
cells resulted in upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression.
Pflanz et al. (2004) concluded that IL27 not only contributes to the
development of an adaptive immune response through its action on
CD4-positive T cells, but also directly acts on cells of the innate
immune system.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

IL6 is an immunoregulatory cytokine that activates a cell-surface
signaling assembly composed of IL6, IL6RA, and the shared signaling
receptor gp130. Boulanger et al. (2003) solved the crystal structure of
the extracellular signaling complex to 3.65-angstrom resolution, which
revealed a hexameric, interlocking assembly mediated by a total of 10
symmetry-related, thermodynamically coupled interfaces. Assembly of the
hexameric complex occurs sequentially: IL6 is first engaged by
IL6R-alpha and then presented to gp130 in the proper geometry to
facilitate a cooperative transition into the high affinity,
signaling-competent hexamer. The quaternary structures of other IL6/IL12
family signaling complexes are likely constructed by means of a similar
topologic blueprint.

GENE STRUCTURE

Szalai et al. (2000) determined that the IL6ST gene contains 17 exons
and spans about 51 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Rodriguez et al. (1995) assigned
the functional IL6ST gene to chromosome 5q11 and its nontranscribed
pseudogene to 17p11.

Hartz (2010) mapped the IL6ST gene to chromosome 5q11.2 based on an
alignment of the IL6ST sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB015706) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

- Pseudogenes

Kidd et al. (1992) concluded that there are 2 functional genes for
IL6ST. Rodriguez et al. (1995) showed, however, that the 2 localizations
correspond to a pseudogene (on chromosome 17) and the functional gene on
chromosome 5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Rebouissou et al. (2009) demonstrated a marked activation of the IL6
(147620) signaling pathway in inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas.
Sequencing candidate genes pinpointed the response to somatic
gain-of-function mutations in the IL6ST gene, which encodes the
signaling coreceptor gp130. Rebouissou et al. (2009) found that 60% of
inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas harbor small in-frame deletions
that target the binding sites of gp130 for IL6, and expression of 4
different gp130 mutants in hepatocellular cells activated STAT3 (102582)
in the absence of ligand. Furthermore, analysis of hepatocellular
carcinomas revealed that rare gp130 alterations are always accompanied
by beta-catenin (116806)-activating mutations, suggesting a cooperative
effect of these signaling pathways in the malignant conversion of
hepatocytes. The recurrent gain-of-function gp130 mutations in these
human hepatocellular adenomas fully explains activation of the acute
inflammatory phase observed in tumorous hepatocytes, and suggests that
similar alterations may occur in other inflammatory epithelial tumors
with STAT activation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Cre-loxP-mediated recombination to generate mice harboring a
ventricular-restricted knockout of the gp130 cytokine receptor, Hirota
et al. (1999) demonstrated a critical role for a gp130-dependent myocyte
survival pathway in the transition to heart failure. Such conditional
mutant mice have normal cardiac structure and function, but during
aortic pressure overload, these mice displayed rapid onset of dilated
cardiomyopathy and massive induction of myocyte apoptosis compared with
the control mice, which exhibited compensatory hypertrophy. Thus,
cardiac myocyte apoptosis is a critical point in the transition between
compensatory cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Hirota et al. (1999)
suggested that gp130-dependent cytokines may represent a novel
therapeutic strategy for preventing in vivo heart failure.

Tebbutt et al. (2002) noted that gp130 contains at least 2
cell-signaling modules. One encompasses 4 phosphotyrosine-binding sites
for the SH2 domains of STAT1 and STAT3, whereas the other includes a
phosphotyrosine that activates SHP2 (176876) upstream of the RAS
(190020)-ERK (see 601795) pathway. Tebbutt et al. (2002) generated mice
carrying targeted mutations in each of these modules. Mice homozygous
for a truncated version of gp130 lacking all Stat-binding sites
spontaneously developed intestinal ulceration at sites associated with
repeated mechanical trauma (gastric pylorus and rectum). Unlike wildtype
mice, those with the Stat-binding domain mutation were unable to recover
from trauma induced by ingestion of sodium dextran sulfate. Tebbutt et
al. (2002) noted that impaired wound healing occurs in Tff3
(600633)-null mice, and biochemical analysis confirmed reduced levels of
Tff3 in the mice with the Stat-binding domain mutation. Mice homozygous
for a tyr757-to-phe (Y757F) mutation, which inactivated the Shp2-binding
domain of gp130, developed normally into superficially healthy adults,
but they showed age-dependent enlargement of the stomach, proximal small
intestine, and spleen. Histologic examination revealed
hyperproliferative lesions within the antropyloric mucosa, often
circumferential, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction. Tebbutt et al.
(2002) noted that the gastric pathology was essentially phenocopied in
Tff1 (113710) null mice, and biochemical analysis of gastric Tff1 levels
in mice with the Shp2-binding domain mutation confirmed a 75% reduction
in comparison with wildtype mice; levels of Tff3 were elevated in the
mutant mice. Using a luciferase reporter assay with cells transiently
transfected with gp130 carrying the Stat- and Shp2-binding domain
mutations, Tebbutt et al. (2002) confirmed simultaneous activation of
the Stat1/Stat3 and Shp2-Ras-Erk pathways in response to IL6 activation,
resulting in enhanced luciferase activity of Tff1-luc and Tff3-luc
reporter constructs. Tebbutt et al. (2002) concluded that the
pathologies observed in the gp130 mutant mice resulted from disruption
of the normally simultaneous and coordinated activation of the
Stat1/Stat3 and Shp2-Ras-Erk signaling cascades.

Atsumi et al. (2002) generated mice with a tyr759-to-phe mutation in the
Shp2-binding site of gp130. These mice developed a rheumatoid arthritis
(RA; 180300)-like joint disease at about 1 year of age, accompanied by
autoantibody production and accumulation of memory/activated T cells and
myeloid cells. Before disease onset, T cells were hyperresponsive in
vitro. Mutant mice that were also Rag2 (179616) deficient did not
develop disease, indicating the importance of lymphocytes in this model.
Atsumi et al. (2002) concluded that point mutation in the gp130 cytokine
receptor can induce autoimmune disease.

Jenkins et al. (2005) assessed the contribution of exaggerated Stat3
activation to the phenotype of mice homozygous for Y757F, which disrupts
the negative feedback mechanism on gp130-dependent Stat signaling
(Tebbutt et al., 2002). They found that development of abnormalities
associated with gp130(Y757F) homozygosity, including reduced life span,
splenomegaly, exaggerated hepatic acute-phase response, and spontaneous
gastric adenomas while young, was attenuated when gp130(Y757F)
homozygosity was expressed on a Stat3 +/- background.

Both bone formation and resorption are altered significantly in gp130
-/- mice. Although the mutation results in neonatal lethality, reduced
trabecular bone mass, associated with an increase in osteoclastogenesis,
is a feature of the neonatal skeleton (Kawasaki et al., 1997; Shin et
al., 2004). Sims et al. (2004) found that mouse strains homozygous for
gp130 mutations in the Stat activation sites had normal trabecular bone
volume and bone turnover, but reduced bone length and premature growth
plate closure, suggesting a role for gp130-STAT1/3 signaling in
chondrocyte differentiation. In contrast, mice with mutations in the
gp130 Shp2-Ras-Mapk (see 176948) activation sites showed normal bone
size, but reduced trabecular bone volume and high bone turnover,
associated with increased osteoclastogenesis. Sims et al. (2004)
concluded that gp130 controls balanced regulation of bone growth and
mass depending on selective activation of distinct downstream signaling
pathways.

312173	TITLE *312173 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L10; RPL10
;;QM GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10) is a highly conserved component of the
large ribosome subunit (60S) that plays a crucial role in protein
synthesis (summary by Gong et al., 2009).

CLONING

In an attempt to isolate a suppressor gene in Wilms tumor (see 194070),
Dowdy et al. (1991) performed a subtractive hybridization assay with a
tumorigenic Wilms tumor cell line and its nontumorigenic derivative,
which contained an extra t(X;11) translocation chromosome. A single
novel cDNA clone, designated QM, was identified. The QM mRNA was
modulated between tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cell lines, making QM
gene an attractive tumor suppressor candidate gene.

In the course of investigating disease genes in the Xqter region, van
den Ouweland et al. (1992) found a cosmid that appeared to harbor the QM
gene, as it demonstrated 100% identity with the cDNA sequence published
by Dowdy et al. (1991).

As an essential step toward an exhaustive analysis of the coding
potential of a large region of the genome, Korn et al. (1992) developed
a protocol allowing the rapid isolation of transcripts defined by
overlapping clone libraries. The technique was applied to the analysis
of transcripts from 2 cosmid contigs, which together encompassed a
region of 900 kb in Xq28. They identified 81 cDNA clones, of which 54
clones were mapped back to the cosmid contigs. Of the 54 clones placed
on the contig maps, 12 cDNA clones were shown to belong to 2 genes that
had previously been reported, L1CAM (308840) and QM.

In the process of characterizing cosmid clones from the Xq28 region,
Kaneko et al. (1992) identified a sequence conserved across species in a
particular clone. Using the conserved sequence as a probe, they isolated
cDNA clones and demonstrated that the nucleotide sequence was the same
as that of the QM cDNA. Dowdy et al. (1991) had demonstrated that the QM
cDNA encodes a predicted hydrophilic 25-kD basic protein primarily
consisting of alpha helices. Southern blot analysis of a somatic cell
hybrid panel suggested that the QM gene belongs to a multigene family
with other representatives on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 14, 16, and possibly
other chromosomes. Northern blot analysis detected QM expression in all
adult tissues examined, as well as in cell lines, including HeLa cells,
fibroblasts, and somatic cell hybrids, with increased expression in
liver, spleen, testis, and adrenal gland.

QM is a 214-amino acid polypeptide encoded by a gene previously
designated DXS648. It contains a high percentage of charged amino acids
and binds to the JUN oncogene (165160) and to DNA. Although they found
no matches between QM and any other known transcription factors in
searches of DNA databases, Farmer et al. (1994) found a high degree of
conservation throughout the first 175 residues of the protein when
studies were performed on a diverse array of eukaryotes. Most notable
was the considerable conservation of charged amino acids within specific
regions. The rate of sequence divergence of the various homologs was
found to be slow, of the order of 1% change every 22 million years,
consistent with a critical role of QM in eukaryotic cells. Farmer et al.
(1994) suggested that QM belongs to a novel class of transcription
regulatory proteins.

Oh et al. (2002) determined that the 213-amino acid QM protein contains
4 alpha helices, 2 PKC (see 176960) phosphorylation sites, 2
N-myristoylation sites, and 2 amidation sites. QM colocalized with YES1
(164880) in the cytoplasm of several tumor cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay of a HeLa cell library, Oh et al. (2002)
showed that QM interacted with YES1. Immunoprecipitation analysis and
protein pull-down assays showed that QM interacted with the SRC (190090)
homology-3 (SH3) domain of YES1. QM also interacted with other SRC
family members, including SRC, FYN (137025), HCK (142370), and LYN
(165120). Mutation analysis revealed 2 regions within QM that were
required for YES1 binding, and neither region contained a canonical
SH3-binding motif. Full-length QM suppressed the kinase activity of YES1
by suppressing its autophosphorylation activity. This inhibitory
activity was due predominantly to the C-terminal domain of QM, with
smaller contributions by the 2 SH3-binding regions. QM was not a YES
substrate. Overexpression of QM resulted in increased YES1 mRNA and
protein expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kaneko et al. (1992) demonstrated that the QM gene contains at least 7
exons.

MAPPING

Using exon-specific PCR, van den Ouweland et al. (1992) demonstrated
that the QM gene maps to chromosome Xq28 in the region of the G6PD
(305900) and color vision genes (e.g., OPN1LW; 300822).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Klauck et al. (2006) identified 2 missense mutations (L206M, 312173.0001
and H213Q, 312173.0002) in conserved residues at the end of exon 7 of
the RPL10 gene in patients with autism (AUTSX5; 300847). Chiocchetti et
al. (2011) identified an additional family with the H213Q mutation.

- Somatic Mutation in T-cell ALL

De Keersmaecker et al. (2013) identified mutations affecting the
ribosomal proteins RPL5 (603634) and RPL10 (312173) in 12 of 122 (9.8%)
pediatric T-ALLs, with recurrent alterations in RPL10 of arg98, an
invariant residue from yeast to human. Yeast and lymphoid cells
expressing the RPL10 arg98 to ser mutant showed a ribosome biogenesis
defect.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AUTISM, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, X-LINKED 5
RPL10, LEU206MET

In autistic dizygotic male twins from a German family (AUTSX5; 300847),
Klauck et al. (2006) identified a C-to-A transversion at nucleotide 616
in exon 7 of the RPL10 gene, resulting in a leu-to-met substitution at
codon 206 (L206M). This mutation was found in heterozygosity in the
mother. Leucine at position 206 is conserved through yeast, but an
isoleucine occurs at this codon in Drosophila. The mutation was not
identified in 408 control chromosomes.

.0002
AUTISM, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, X-LINKED 5
RPL10, HIS213GLN

In a German family with 2 brothers affected with autism (AUTSX5;
300847), Klauck et al. (2006) identified a C-to-G transversion at
nucleotide 693 in exon 7 of the RPL10 gene, resulting in a his-to-glu
substitution at codon 213 (H213Q). This mutation was found in both
affected sons, was not identified in the unaffected son or father, and
was identified in heterozygosity in the mother. Histine-213 is conserved
through all vertebrate species tested, including mouse, chicken,
Xenopus, and zebrafish. The mutation was not identified in 408 control
chromosomes.

Chiocchetti et al. (2011) identified another occurrence of this mutation
in an autistic male from a German family. The mother, older sister, and
maternal grandmother all carried the mutation. This family did not
appear to be related to the family reported by Klauck et al. (2006).
Chiocchetti et al. (2011) found normal RPL10 expression in probands with
H213Q mutant alleles, non-RPL10 mutated autism patients, and healthy
controls.

;;CHROMOSOME 22 OPEN READING FRAME 1; C22ORF1;;
ADULT BRAIN PROTEIN 239; 239AB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Schwartz and Ota (1997) described a cDNA sequence and expression profile
of a gene, designated 239AB by them, that was isolated from adult brain
library and shares 79% identity with 239FB (600911) isolated from fetal
brain. The deduced amino acid sequence of 239AB was 302 amino acids long
and contained 8 additional amino acids at its N terminus compared to
239FB. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb transcript in all adult
human tissues analyzed that was most prominent in pancreas, liver,
skeletal muscle, heart, and testis. An intensely hybridizing 3.6-kb
message was detected only in brain, and was the most abundant transcript
in this tissue. Both genes are highly conserved from C. elegans to birds
and mammals. Schwartz and Ota (1997) concluded that the 239FB and 239AB
genes belong to an ancient family of genes. Phylogenetic analysis
suggested that 239FB and 239AB have origins dating back to a time before
the emergence of modern animals.

MAPPING

Schwartz and Ota (1997) mapped the MPPED1 gene to chromosome 22 by PCR
analysis of monochromosomal human/rodent somatic cell hybrids.

611905	TITLE *611905 FIBRONECTIN TYPE III DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; FNDC4
;;FRCP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Teufel et al. (2002) cloned the genomic region for a predicted
fibronectin type III repeat-containing protein, Fndc4, from a mouse BAC
clone. The putative 219-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal signal
peptide, a fibronectin type III domain, and a transmembrane domain. By
database analysis, they identified human FNDC4, which encodes a protein
that shares over 95% homology with the mouse protein. They also
identified a second mouse gene, Fndc5 (611906), that shares 60% identity
in the FNIII domain and 86% identity in the transmembrane domain with
mouse Fndc4. They found no homologs in invertebrates. Northern blot
analysis of multiple mouse tissues detected 2 Fndc4 transcripts of
approximately 2 and 3 kb, with highest expression in adult brain and
liver, and low expression in heart, lung, kidney, and testis. The
transcripts were expressed at similar levels in most tissues except
liver, where the 2-kb transcript was expressed much more strongly.
Northern blot analysis of mouse embryonic mRNA revealed strongest
expression of Fndc4 at embryonic day 11 and decreasing expression at
E17. In situ hybridization demonstrated expression of Fndc4 in the fore-
and midbrain, and extending into the hindbrain. Overexpression of a
GFP-Fndc4 fusion protein in COS cells showed localization predominantly
in the endoplasmic reticulum, with small amounts in the plasma membrane.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the FNDC4
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH102212). Teufel et al. (2002) mapped the
mouse Fndc4 gene to chromosome 5.

612760	TITLE *612760 SNF-RELATED KINASE; SNRK
;;SNF1-RELATED KINASE;;
KIAA0096
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNRK is a member of the sucrose nonfermenting (SNF)-related kinase
family of serine/threonine kinases (Kertesz et al., 2002).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated KG-1 immature
myeloid cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1995) obtained a partial
SNRK clone, which they designated KIAA0096. The deduced protein has a
prenylation site. Northern blot analysis detected SNRK expression in all
tissues and cell lines examined, with highest expression in peripheral
blood leukocytes.

Using the partial cDNA clone KIAA0096 isolated by Nagase et al. (1995)
and the corresponding rat Snrk cDNA for 5-prime RACE, Kertesz et al.
(2002) cloned full-length human SNRK from KG-1 cell RNA. The deduced
766-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 84.27 kD and
shares 88% identity with mouse Snrk. Human, rat, and mouse SNRK proteins
share a conserved serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain, a bipartite
nuclear targeting signal, and an SNF1 homology domain (SNH), the latter
being characteristic of some SNF1-related proteins and also found within
a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain in ubiquitin pathway enzymes.

By RT-PCR of CD34+ cell subsets sorted by FACS analysis, Kertesz et al.
(2002) detected significantly lower SNRK expression in quiescent
CD34+/CD38- cells compared to highly proliferating CD34+/CD38+ cells and
suggested that SNRK may be involved in hematopoietic proliferation. In
addition, they detected SNRK expression in numerous leukemic cell lines
with the exception of TF-1 cells. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of
mouse embryos detected Snrk expression at 8-8.5 days postcoitum
extending dorsally along the epithelium of the differentiating neural
tube. After 12.5 days postcoitum, Snrk expression became more restricted
to the caudal neurotube and neuropore. Snrk expression was also detected
in developing primitive gut endoderm, and pericardium of the developing
heart, aorta, and endothelial and hematopoietic cells of the yolk-sac
blood islands and vessels. Later in development, 12.5-14.5 days
postcoitum, Snrk expression persisted in the endocardium and heart
septum with decreased neural tube and gut expression. RT-PCR of adult
mouse tissues detected strong Snrk expression in kidney, liver, testis,
thymus, lymph node, and spleen with lower expression in brain, heart,
and lung.

Of 9 rat tissues studied by immunoprecipitation, immunoblot, and
activity assay, Jaleel et al. (2005) detected Snrk protein and enzymatic
activity only in testis.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro kinase assay of recombinant SNRK, Kertesz et al. (2002)
demonstrated that SNRK acts as a kinase and displays autophosphorylation
activity.

Jaleel et al. (2005) identified SNRK as a substrate for the LKB1 tumor
suppressor (STK11; 602216), which phosphorylated SNRK at residue thr173.
LKB1 is required for phosphorylation and activation of SNRK in HeLa
cells and required STRAD (608626) and MO25 (see CAB39, 612174) LKB1
complex-associated subunits.

Using morpholino-mediated gene knockdown in zebrafish, Pramanik et al.
(2009) showed that Dusp5 (603069) and Snrk1 targeted a common signaling
pathway and coordinately functioned in controlling angioblast numbers at
the lateral plate mesoderm.

Using gain- and loss-of-function studies, Chun et al. (2009) showed that
Snrk1 played an essential role in the migration, maintenance, and
differentiation of angioblasts in zebrafish. The kinase function of
Snrk1 was critical for migration and maintenance, but not for
differentiation of angioblasts. In vitro, Snrk1-knockdown endothelial
cells showed only defects in migration. Snrk1 acted downstream or
parallel to Notch (NOTCH1; 190198) and upstream of gridlock (HEY2;
604674) during artery-vein specification. The human SNRK gene
compensated for zebrafish Snrk1 knockdown, suggesting conservation of
function.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kertesz et al. (2002) determined that the SNRK gene contains 6 exons
spanning 39.8 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the SNRK gene
to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Kertesz et al. (2002)
mapped the SNRK gene to chromosome 3p21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Somatic Mutations

Pramanik et al. (2009) identified a somatic arg248-to-gln (R248Q)
mutation in the SNRK gene in 8 of 24 vascular anomaly samples, including
venous and lymphatic malformations, but not infantile hemangiomas
(602089). Six of the 8 samples also carried a somatic ser147-to-pro
(S147P) mutation in the DUSP5 gene. Since studies in zebrafish
implicated a role for the Dusp5/Snrk signaling pathway in vascular
development, the findings suggested that variation in these genes may
provide susceptibility to the development of vascular anomalies in
humans.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS; 194190) is a malformation syndrome
associated with a hemizygous deletion of the distal short arm of
chromosome 4 (4p16.3). The shortest region of overlap of the deletions
observed in WHS patients, the WHS critical region, has been confined to
a region of 165 kb (Wright et al., 1997). This region was sequenced
completely during the search for the Huntington disease gene (Baxendale
et al., 1993). Stec et al. (1998) described a novel developmental gene,
two-thirds of which maps in the distal part of the WHS critical region.
They designated the gene WHSC1 (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate-1).
The WHSC1 gene was identified initially through its high similarity to
the translation product of an expressed sequence tag, located in the
165-kb WHCR, with the SET domain (see 600960) of the Drosophila protein
ASH1 (607999). The SET domain is found in proteins that are involved in
embryonic development. The WHSC1 gene was found to be expressed
ubiquitously in early development and to undergo complex alternative
splicing and differential polyadenylation. It encodes a 136-kD protein
containing 4 domains present in other developmental proteins: a PWWP
domain, an HMG box, a SET domain also found in the Drosophila dysmorphy
gene ash-encoded protein, and a PHD-type zinc finger. It is expressed
preferentially in rapidly growing embryonic tissues, in a pattern
corresponding to affected organs in WHS patients. The nature of the
protein motifs, the expression pattern, and its mapping to the critical
region led Stec et al. (1998) to propose WHSC1 as a good candidate gene
to be responsible for many of the phenotypic features of WHS.

GENE FUNCTION

Nimura et al. (2009) showed that the H3K36me3-specific histone
methyltransferase Whsc1 functions in transcriptional regulation together
with developmental transcription factors whose defects overlap with the
human disease Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS). Nimura et al. (2009) found
that mouse Whsc1, 1 of 5 putative Set2 homologs, governed H3K36me3 along
euchromatin by associating with the cell type-specific transcription
factors Sall1 (602218), Sall4 (607343), and Nanog (607937) in embryonic
stem cells, and Nkx2-5 (600584) in embryonic hearts, regulating the
expression of their target genes. Whsc1-deficient mice showed growth
retardation and various WHS-like midline defects, including congenital
cardiovascular anomalies. The effects of Whsc1 haploinsufficiency were
increased in Nkx2-5 heterozygous mutant hearts, indicating their
functional link. Nimura et al. (2009) proposed that WHSC1 functions
together with developmental transcription factors to prevent the
inappropriate transcription that can lead to various pathophysiologies.

Pei et al. (2011) found that H4K20 methylation actually increases
locally upon the induction of double-strand breaks and that methylation
of H4K20 at double-strand breaks is mediated by the histone
methyltransferase MMSET in mammals. Downregulation of MMSET
significantly decreases H4K20 methylation at double-strand breaks and
the subsequent accumulation of 53BP1 (605230). Furthermore, Pei et al.
(2011) found that the recruitment of MMSET to double-strand breaks
requires the gamma-H2AX (601772)-MDC1 (607593) pathway; specifically,
the interaction between the MDC1 BRCT domain and phosphorylated ser102
of MMSET. Thus, Pei et al. (2011) proposed that a pathway involving
gamma-H2AX-MDC1-MMSET regulates the induction of H4K20 methylation on
histones around double-strand breaks, which, in turn, facilitates 53BP1
recruitment.

GENE STRUCTURE

The WHSC1 gene contains 25 exons (Stec et al., 1998).

MAPPING

Stec et al. (1998) mapped the WHSC1 gene to chromosome 4p16.3 based on
genomic sequence analysis.

CYTOGENETICS

Stec et al. (1998) noted that the t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.3) translocations
described in a significant fraction of multiple myelomas (Richelda et
al., 1997; Chesi et al., 1997) have breakpoints located less than 100 kb
centromeric of the FGFR3 gene (134934) on 4p16.3. They found that at
least 3 of the breakpoints merged the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene
(IGHG1; 147100) on chromosome 14 with the WHSC1 gene. This fusion of
genes and their untimely expression in the myeloid lineage driven from
the 5-prime IgH enhancer may indicate that WHSC1-encoded proteins are
involved in the clinical heterogeneity of multiple myeloma.

602949	TITLE *602949 SIN3-ASSOCIATED POLYPEPTIDE, 18-KD; SAP18
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

An important event in gene expression is the modification of histone
proteins. Hyperacetylation of core histones has been correlated with
gene activation, and hypoacetylation with gene repression. SIN3 (see
607776)-mediated repression of transcription involves the modification
of histone polypeptides. Zhang et al. (1997) purified a SIN3-containing
complex from HeLa cells and found that SIN3 was associated with SAP18,
SAP30 (603378), RBBP4 (602923), RBBP7 (300825), and the histone
deacetylases HDAC1 (601241) and HDAC2 (605164). By searching sequence
databases with SAP18 peptide sequences, the authors identified several
human SAP18 expressed sequence tags from which they constructed a
full-length hybrid SAP18 cDNA. The predicted 153-amino acid SAP18
protein is 49% identical to a C. elegans SAP18 homolog. SAP18 has a
molecular mass of 18 kD by SDS-PAGE. SAP18 was expressed in all tissues
analyzed.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (1997) demonstrated that SAP18 directly interacts with SIN3
and enhances SIN3-mediated transcriptional repression. They observed
that SAP18 directs the formation of a repressive complex when tethered
to the promoter.

608938	TITLE *608938 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S6 KINASE, 70-KD, 1; RPS6KB1
;;S6K1;;
p70 S6 KINASE, ALPHA;;
p70(S6K)-ALPHA;;
p70-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RPS6KB1 mediates the rapid phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6
(180460) on multiple serine residues in response to insulin or several
classes of mitogens (Grove et al., 1991).

CLONING

By screening fibroblast and hepatoma cell line cDNA libraries using a
rat Rps6kb1 probe, Grove et al. (1991) cloned 2 splice variants of human
RPS6KB1, which they designated alpha-I and alpha-II. The deduced
proteins contain 525 and 502 amino acids, respectively, and are
identical except for the 23 additional N-terminal residues present in
alpha-I. Exogenous expression of alpha-I cDNA in COS-7 cells resulted in
closely-spaced ladders of polypeptides between 65 and 70 kD and between
85 and 90 kD, whereas expression of the alpha-II cDNA resulted in
peptides between 65 and 70 kD only. Grove et al. (1991) determined that
alpha-I produced both polypeptide clusters by utilizing 2 initiator
methionine codons, the second of which is present in the alpha-II
transcript. The laddering within the 2 clusters was caused
posttranslational modification of the kinase polypeptide by
phosphorylation at multiple sites.

Gout et al. (1998) described the domain organization of the p70 alpha-1
protein, which includes an N-terminal noncatalytic region, a catalytic
domain, a kinase extension domain, an autoinhibitory domain, and a
C-terminal tail. The p70 alpha-1 protein shares 70% amino acid identity
with the p70 beta protein (RPS6KB2; 608939), and 7 serine or threonine
phosphorylation sites are completely conserved. Northern blot analysis
detected 3.4- and 7.4-kb transcripts in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Grove et al. (1991) found that transient expression of p70 S6K alpha-I
and alpha-II in COS-7 cells resulted in a 2.5- to 4.0-fold increase in
overall S6 kinase activity. Immunoblot analysis detected alpha-I and
alpha-II as closely spaced ladders of polypeptides between 85 and 90 kD
and between 65 and 70 kD, respectively. Only the alpha-I and alpha-II
proteins of slowest mobility were associated with S6 kinase activity.
The slower mobility and higher enzymatic activity of the rat p70 S6K
proteins were due to serine/threonine phosphorylation, since
phosphatase-2A inactivated the kinase activity and increased the
mobility of the bands on polyacrylamide gels. Grove et al. (1991)
concluded that acquisition of S6 protein kinase catalytic function is
restricted to the most extensively phosphorylated polypeptides.

Gout et al. (1998) examined the catalytic activity of p70 alpha-1
transiently expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing
human insulin receptor (147670). S6 kinase activity was stimulated by
insulin, serum, phorbol ester, and PDGF (see 190040). In transfected
human embryonic kidney cells, serum-activated kinase activity was
potently inhibited by rapamycin and wortmannin in a dose-dependent
manner, suggesting that MTOR (601231) and PI3 kinase (see 602925) are
involved in p70 alpha-1 activation.

Saitoh et al. (1998) characterized p70 S6K-alpha expressed by human
embryonic kidney cells. A 32-mer S6 peptide was phosphorylated by the
wildtype kinase, but not by a catalytically inactivated lys100-to-arg
mutant kinase.

In mammals, MTOR cooperates with PI3K-dependent effectors in a
biochemical signaling pathway to regulate the size of proliferating
cells. Fingar et al. (2002) presented evidence that rat S6k1 alpha-II,
Eif4e (133440), and Eif4ebp1 (602223) mediate Mtor-dependent cell size
control.

Holz et al. (2005) showed that MTOR and S6K1 maneuvered on and off the
EIF3 (see 602039) translation initiation complex in HEK293 cells in a
signal-dependent, choreographed fashion. When inactive, S6K1 associated
with the EIF3 complex, while the S6K1 activator MTOR, in association
with its binding partner RAPTOR (607130), did not. Hormone- or
mitogen-mediated cell stimulation promoted MTOR/RAPTOR binding to the
EIF3 complex and phosphorylation of S6K1. Phosphorylation resulted in
S6K1 dissociation and activation, followed by phosphorylation of S6K1
targets, including EIF4B (603928), which, upon phosphorylation, was
recruited into the EIF3 complex. Holz et al. (2005) concluded that the
EIF3 preinitiation complex acts as a scaffold to coordinate responses to
stimuli that promote efficient protein synthesis.

Dorrello et al. (2006) found that the tumor suppressor programmed cell
death protein-4 (PDCD4; 608610) inhibits the translation initiation
factor EIF4A (see 602641), an RNA helicase that catalyzes the unwinding
of secondary structure at the 5-prime untranslated region of mRNAs. In
response to mitogens, PDCD4 was rapidly phosphorylated on ser67 by the
protein kinase S6K1 and subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin ligase
SCF-beta(TRCP) (603482). Expression in cultured cells of a stable PDCD4
mutant that was unable to bind beta-TRCP inhibited translation of an
mRNA with a structured 5-prime untranslated region, resulted in smaller
cell size, and slowed down cell cycle progression. Dorrello et al.
(2006) proposed that regulated degradation of PDCD4 in response to
mitogens allows efficient protein synthesis and consequently cell
growth.

Robitaille et al. (2013) found that mTORC1 indirectly phosphorylates the
trifunctional protein CAD (carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-2/aspartate
transcarbamoylase/ dihydroorotase; 114010), which catalyzes the first 3
steps in de novo pyrimidine synthesis, on residue S1859 through S6K.
CAD-S1859 phosphorylation promoted CAD oligomerization and thereby
stimulated de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and progression through S
phase of the cell cycle in mammalian cells. Ben-Sahra et al. (2013)
independently showed that activation of mTORC1 led to the acute
stimulation of metabolic flux through the de novo pyrimidine synthesis
pathway. mTORC1 signaling posttranslationally regulated this metabolic
pathway via its downstream target S6K1, which directly phosphorylates
S1859 on CAD. Growth signaling through mTORC1 thus stimulates the
production of new nucleotides to accommodate an increase in RNA and DNA
synthesis needed for ribosome biogenesis and anabolic growth.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RPS6KB1
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-34099).

ANIMAL MODEL

Shima et al. (1998) generated mice deficient in S6k1 by targeted
disruption. These mice were viable and fertile, but exhibited a
conspicuous reduction in body size during embryogenesis, an effect that
was mostly overcome by adulthood. Shima et al. (1998) hypothesized that
the weak penetrance of the phenotype may arise from increased expression
in S6k1-deficient mice of the highly homologous gene S6k2.

Pende et al. (2000) showed that mice deficient for S6k1, a known
effector of the phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase signaling pathway,
were hypoinsulinemic and glucose intolerant. Whereas insulin resistance
was not observed in isolated muscle, such mice exhibited a sharp
reduction in glucose-induced insulin secretion and in pancreatic insulin
content. This was not due to a lesion in glucose sensing or insulin
production, but to a reduction in pancreatic endocrine mass, which was
accounted for by a selective decrease in beta-cell size. Pende et al.
(2000) concluded that the observed phenotype closely parallels those of
preclinical type II diabetes mellitus, in which malnutrition-induced
hypoinsulinemia predisposes individuals to glucose intolerance.

Pende et al. (2004) found that mice deficient in S6k1 or S6k2 were born
at expected mendelian ratios. Compared with wildtype mice, S6k1 -/- mice
were significantly smaller, and S6k2 -/- mice tended to be slightly
larger. Mice lacking both genes showed a sharp reduction in viability
due to perinatal lethality. Analysis of S6 phosphorylation in the
cytoplasm and nucleoli of cells derived from each S6k genotype suggested
that both kinases are required for full S6 phosphorylation, but that
S6k2 may contribute more to the response. Despite the impairment of S6
phosphorylation in cells from double-knockout mice, cell cycle
progression and translation of 5-prime terminal oligopyrimidine mRNAs
were still modulated by mitogens in a rapamycin-dependent manner.
Double-knockout cells also showed persistence of S6 phosphorylation on
the first 2 serines phosphorylated in response to mitogens, and this
step was catalyzed by a MAPK-dependent kinase. Pende et al. (2004)
concluded that a redundancy exists between the S6K and MAPK pathways in
mediating early S6 phosphorylation in response to mitogens.

Um et al. (2004) reported that S6k1-deficient mice are protected against
obesity due to enhanced beta-oxidation; however, on a high-fat diet,
levels of glucose and free fatty acids still rose in S6k1-deficient
mice, resulting in insulin receptor desensitization. Nevertheless,
S6k1-deficient mice remained sensitive to insulin due to the apparent
loss of a negative feedback loop from S6k1 to insulin receptor
substrate-1 (IRS1; 147545), which blunts phosphorylation of serines at
positions 307, 636, and 639, all sites involved in insulin resistance.
Moreover, wildtype mice on a high-fat diet as well as K/K A(y) and ob/ob
mice had markedly elevated S6k1 activity and, unlike S6k1-deficient
mice, increased phosphorylation of Irs1 serines at positions 307, 636,
and 639. Um et al. (2004) concluded that under conditions of nutrient
satiation, S6K1 negatively regulates insulin signaling.

Selman et al. (2009) demonstrated in mice that deletion of S6K1, a
component of the nutrient-responsive mTOR signaling pathway, led to
increased life span and resistance to age-related pathologies such as
bone, immune, and motor dysfunction and loss of insulin sensitivity.
Deletion of S6K1 induced gene expression patterns similar to those seen
in caloric restriction or with pharmacologic activation of adenosine
monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a conserved
regulator of the metabolic response to caloric restriction.

608686	TITLE *608686 RAB3A-INTERACTING PROTEIN; RAB3IP
;;RABIN8;;
RABIN3, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; RABIN3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using SSX2 (300192) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a testis cDNA
library, de Bruijn et al. (2002) cloned RAB3IP. They identified 6
alternatively spliced RAB3IP transcripts, the longest of which encodes a
deduced 476-amino acid protein containing a central coiled-coil domain,
a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and a C-terminal endoplasmic
reticulum retention motif. RAB3IP has several sites for N-glycosylation
and phosphorylation. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.1-kb transcript
in brain, kidney, heart, placenta, and pancreas, but not in skeletal
muscle and liver. Transcripts of 3.8 and 10.2 kb were also detected in
brain and kidney. EST database analysis revealed that RAB3IP was also
expressed in retina, fetal thymus, and B-cell germinal centers. In vitro
transcription and translation of RAB3IP cDNA resulted in a protein that
migrated at an apparent molecular mass of 56 kD by SDS-PAGE.
Immunofluorescence analysis of transfected HeLa cells localized RAB32IP
in the cytoplasm; however, coexpression of RAB3IP with SSX2 led to
colocalization of both proteins in the nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

By in vitro pull-down assays, de Bruijn et al. (2002) confirmed the
interaction between RAB3IP and SSX2. RAB3IP specifically interacted with
an N-terminal domain of SSX2, and it did not interact with SSX1
(312820), SSX3 (300325), or SSX4 (300326).

GENE STRUCTURE

De Bruijn et al. (2002) determined that the RAB3IP gene contains 12
exons and spans almost 77 kb. The 5-prime end lacks canonical CAAT and
TATA boxes, but has a high GC content, characteristics of a housekeeping
gene.

MAPPING

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Microtubule-associated proteins MAP1A (600178) and MAP1B (157129)
constitute nearly half of the mass of all the microtubule associated
proteins that copurify with brain microtubules. MAP1A and MAP1B are each
composed of a heavy chain and multiple light-chain subunits. Two of
these light-chain subunits, LC1 and LC2, are encoded within the 3-prime
end of the same open reading frames that encode the MAP1B and MAP1A
heavy chains, respectively (Hammarback et al., 1991; Langkopf et al.,
1992). Mann and Hammarback (1996) examined the expression of another
light chain, LC3, which is a component of both MAP1A and MAP1B
microtubule-binding complexes. They found that, although LC3 was
expressed exclusively in cells expressing heavy chains, developmental
changes in the total amount of LC3 protein were not proportional to the
amounts of either heavy chain MAP1A or MAP1B. Using LC3-specific
oligonucleotides, Mann and Hammarback (1996) amplified a 300-bp LC3
fragment from a human retina cDNA library.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to rat Map1lc3,
followed by PCR of a heart cDNA library, He et al. (2003) cloned
MAP1LC3A. The deduced 121-amino acid protein shares 81% identity with
rat Map1lc3. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.1-kb transcript in most
tissues examined, with highest expression in heart, brain, liver,
skeletal muscle, and testis. No MAP1LC3A expression was detected in
thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes. Western blot analysis of
transfected human embryonic kidney cells detected MAP1LC3A proteins of
about 18 and 15 kD. Following fractionation of transfected HeLa cells,
the 15-kD form associated with the membrane pellet and the 18-kD form
associated with both the membrane and cytosolic fractions.

GENE FUNCTION

Rat Lc3 is processed into cytosolic and membrane-bound forms termed Lc3
I and Lc3 II, respectively. Kabeya et al. (2000) found that the
autophagic vacuole fraction prepared from starved rat liver was enriched
with Lc3 II. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed specific labeling of
autophagosome membrane in addition to cytoplasmic labeling. Lc3 II was
present both inside and outside autophagosomes. Mutation analysis
indicated that Lc3 I was formed by removal of the C-terminal 22 amino
acids from newly synthesized Lc3, leaving a C-terminal glyc120 residue.
A fraction of Lc3 I was then converted into Lc3 II. The amount of Lc3 II
produced correlated with the extent of autophagosome formation.

He et al. (2003) found that MAP1LC3A underwent C-terminal cleavage,
resulting in a protein with the conserved gly120 as its terminal
residue. Gly120 was required for posttranslational modification of
MAP1LC3A.

Behrends et al. (2010) reported a proteomic analysis of the autophagy
interaction network (AIN) in human cells under conditions of ongoing
(basal) autophagy, revealing a network of 751 interactions among 409
candidate interacting proteins with extensive connectivity among
subnetworks. Many new AIN components have roles in vesicle trafficking,
protein or lipid phosphorylation, and protein ubiquitination, and affect
autophagosome number or flux when depleted by RNA interference. The 6
human orthologs of yeast autophagy-8 (ATG8), MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B
(609604), MAP1LC3C (609605), GABARAP (605125), GABARAPL1 (607420), and
GABARAPL2 (607452), interact with a cohort of 67 proteins, with
extensive binding partner overlap between family members, and frequent
involvement of a conserved surface on ATG8 proteins known to interact
with LC3-interacting regions in partner proteins. Behrends et al. (2010)
concluded that their studies provided a global view of the mammalian
autophagy interaction landscape and a resource for mechanistic analysis
of this critical protein homeostasis pathway.

Choy et al. (2012) found that the intracellular pathogen Legionella
pneumophila could interfere with autophagy by using the bacterial
effector protein RavZ to directly uncouple Atg8 proteins attached to
phosphatidylethanolamine on autophagosome membranes. RavZ hydrolyzed the
amide bond between the carboxyl-terminal glycine residue and an adjacent
aromatic residue in Atg8 proteins, producing an Atg8 protein that could
not be reconjugated by Atg7 (see 608760) and Atg3 (see 609606). Thus,
Choy et al. (2012) concluded that intracellular pathogens can inhibit
autophagy by irreversibly inactivating Atg8 proteins during infection.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Microtubule-associated protein light chain-3, a mammalian homolog of
yeast Atg8, plays an essential role in autophagy, which is involved in
the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components by the lysosomal system.
Sugawara et al. (2004) described the crystal structure of LC3 at
2.05-angstrom resolution; it has a ubiquitin fold at the C-terminal
region and 2 helices at the N-terminal region.

MAPPING

Mann and Hammarback (1996) mapped the LC3 gene to chromosome 20cen-q13
using a human/rodent hybrid cell mapping panel.

613056	TITLE *613056 LUC7, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 2; LUC7L2
;;LUC7-LIKE 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Howell et al. (2007) cloned Luc7l2 from an embryonic mouse cDNA library.
The deduced full-length Luc7l2 protein contains 392 amino acids and has
an N-terminal CCCH-type zinc finger, followed by a coiled-coil domain, a
C2H2-type zinc finger, an arginine- and glutamine-rich (RE) region, an
arginine- and serine-rich (RS) region, and a C-terminal arginine-rich
(R) region. It also has 3 nuclear localization signals in the RS region.
Howell et al. (2007) also identified Luc7l2 variants that used an
alternative polyadenylation site in intron 9, resulting in a truncated
335-amino acid protein lacking the C-terminal R region, as well as
variants exhibiting alternative splicing of exon 8, which removes the
5-prime end of the RS region. Northern blot analysis detected 2 major
transcripts in mouse brain, kidney, heart, thymus, stomach, skeletal
muscle, and testis. RT-PCR showed that all Luc7l2 variants were
ubiquitously expressed in mouse tissues. EST database analysis suggested
highest expression in lymph node, sympathetic ganglia, and midgestation
embryos. Fluorescence-tagged Luc7l2 was expressed in a speckled nuclear
pattern in transfected 293T cells.

GENE FUNCTION

The yeast ortholog of LUC7L2 is a spliceosomal protein involved in
recognition of nonconsensus splice donor sites. Using a yeast 2-hybrid
assay, Howell et al. (2007) showed that mouse Luc7l2 interacted with the
C terminus of Scnm1 (608095), a protein involved in splicing at
nonconsensus donor sites.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Howell et al. (2007) mapped the LUC7L2
gene to chromosome 7q34. They mapped the mouse Luc7l2 gene to a region
of chromosome 6 that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
7q34.

609849	TITLE *609849 CORONIN 1B; CORO1B
;;CORONIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the coronin family, such as CORO1B, are WD repeat-containing
actin-binding proteins that regulate cell motility (Cai et al., 2005).

CLONING

Okumura et al. (1998) cloned mouse Coro1b, which they called coronin-2,
and identified its human homolog by EST database analysis. Northern blot
analysis showed highest expression of mouse Cor1b in spleen, lung,
liver, and kidney.

Cai et al. (2005) cloned human CORO1B. The deduced 489-amino acid
protein contains WD40 repeats in its N-terminal half and a coiled-coil
region at its C terminus. Fluorescence-tagged CORO1B localized
predominantly to the leading edge of transfected fibroblasts, with some
localization along actin stress fibers.

GENE FUNCTION

Cai et al. (2005) found that CORO1B could homodimerize, but it did not
form complexes with other coronins. CORO1B was phosphorylated by protein
kinase C (PKC; see 176960) in vitro and in vivo. Using tryptic peptide
mapping and mutagenesis, Cai et al. (2005) identified ser2 as the major
CORO1B residue phosphorylated by PCK in vivo. Rat fibroblasts expressing
human CORO1B with a ser2-to-ala mutation showed enhanced ruffling in
response to phorbol esters and increased speed in single-cell tracking
assays. Cells expressing a constitutively active CORO1B mutant (ser2 to
asp) had attenuated ruffling and slower cell speed in response to
phorbol esters. CORO1B interacted with the ARP2/3 complex (604221), and
the interaction was regulated by PKC phosphorylation of CORO1B. Cai et
al. (2005) concluded that CORO1B regulates leading edge dynamics and
cell motility in fibroblasts and that its interaction with the ARP2/3
complex is regulated by PKC phosphorylation at ser2.

MAPPING

Hartz (2006) mapped the CORO1B gene to chromosome 11q13.2 based on an
alignment of the CORO1B sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000860) with the
genomic sequence (build 35). Okumura et al. (1998) mapped the mouse
Coro1b gene to chromosome 19.

300393	TITLE *300393 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 101; GPR101
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, or GPRs) contain 7 transmembrane
domains and transduce extracellular signals through heterotrimeric G
proteins.

CLONING

Lee et al. (2001) identified GPR101 within a genomic database using
sequences of the histamine receptor H1 (600167) as query. PCR primers
were designed to amplify and clone GPR101 from a genomic library.
Full-length GPR101 encodes a deduced 508-amino acid protein that shares
approximately 30% sequence identity in the transmembrane regions with
the G protein-coupled receptor RE2, the serotonin 5HT1A receptor (HTR1A;
109760), and the alpha-1A-adrenergic receptor (104221). Northern blot
analysis of human brain tissues revealed expression of 9.5- and 4.2-kb
transcripts in the caudate putamen and hypothalamus. No expression was
detected in cortex, thalamus, hippocampus and pons.

MAPPING

Lee et al. (2001) mapped the GPR101 gene to the X chromosome based on
sequence similarity between the GPR101 sequence and a genomic clone
(GenBank GENBANK AL390879) localized to the X chromosome.

614301	TITLE *614301 ATAXIN 1-LIKE; ATXN1L
;;BROTHER OF ATAXIN 1; BOAT; BOAT1;;
BROTHER OF ATXN1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATXN1 (601556) and ATXN1L are chromatin-binding factors that suppress
signaling within the Notch pathway (see 190198) in the absence of Notch
activation (Tong et al., 2011).

CLONING

By searching databases for proteins with ATXN1 and HBP1 (AXH) domains,
followed by RT-PCR of cerebellum mRNA, Mizutani et al. (2005) cloned
human ATXN1L, which they called BOAT. The deduced 689-amino acid protein
has an N-terminal BOAT and ATXN1 (NBA) domain and a C-terminal AXH
domain. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a
transcript of about 9 kb in all brain regions examined, with highest
expression in cerebellum and cerebral cortex. RNA dot blot analysis
revealed widespread BOAT expression. Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed similar expression patterns for Boat and Atxn1 in various
regions of mouse brain. Boat and Atxn1 were primarily expressed as
nuclear proteins in most brain cells, but they were also expressed in
cell bodies and dendrites in Purkinje cells and inferior olive cells.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ATXN1L gene to chromosome 16q22.2 based on an
alignment of the ATXN1L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025113) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Mizutani et al. (2005) showed that BOAT
interacted with itself and with ATXN1, and they confirmed the
interaction between BOAT and ATXN1 in human cell culture and Drosophila.
Truncation analysis showed that the NBA domain of BOAT mediated its
self-association and interaction with ATXN1, whereas the SAR and NBA
domains of ATXN1 mediated its self-association and interaction with
BOAT. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis revealed that BOAT also interacted with
SMRT (NCOR2; 600848), NCOR1 (600849), and the Drosophila SMRT ortholog,
Smrter. Truncation analysis showed that the AHX domain of BOAT mediated
its interactions with SMRT, NCOR1, and Smrter, and that the NBA domain
of BOAT also interacted with SMRT. Truncation analysis and reporter gene
assays revealed that ATXN1 contains a C-terminal transcriptional
repressive domain only, whereas BOAT contains independent N- and
C-terminal transcriptional repressive domains. Immunoprecipitation
analysis showed that endogenous BOAT, SMRT, and ATXN1 interacted in a
complex in HeLa cells. Overexpression of BOAT in MCF-7 cells caused
nuclear foci and altered the nuclear localization of endogenous SMRT and
HDAC3 (605166). Expression of ATXN1 with an SCA1 (164400)-associated
polyglutamine expansion (82Q) caused an abnormal eye phenotype in
Drosophila, and this phenotype was reversed by coexpression of BOAT.
SCA1 mice, which express human mutant ATXN1 in Purkinje cells, showed
reduced expression of Boat and Smrt compared with wildtype mice.
Mizutani et al. (2005) hypothesized that BOAT inhibits mutant ATXN1
toxicity by dimerizing with ATXN1 and reducing mutant ATXN1
self-association.

Notch signaling involves proteolytic release of the Notch intracellular
domain (NICD), followed by NICD-dependent gene activation. Tong et al.
(2011) found that expression of human BOAT1 in Drosophila wing disrupted
Notch signaling, leading to wing defects. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis
of HEK293 cells revealed that both BOAT1 and ATXN1 precipitated CBF1
(RBPJ; 147183), which functions as a transcriptional activator when
associated with NICD. Protein pull-down and yeast 2-hybrid analyses
confirmed the interactions and showed that BOAT1 and ATXN1 competed for
CBF1 binding. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that NICD
disrupted CBF1-BOAT/ATXN1 interactions. Reporter gene assays revealed
that both BOAT1 and ATXN1 inhibited CBF1 activity at the HEY1 (602953)
promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Boat1 and
Atxn1, in addition to Smrt, occupied the Hey1 promoter in
differentiating mouse C2C12 myoblasts. Atxn1 bound the Hey1 promoter
transiently, whereas Boat1 and Smrt remained bound to the Hey1 promoter
under the same conditions. Tong et al. (2011) concluded that BOAT1 and
ATXN1 are chromatin-binding factors that repress Notch signaling in the
absence of NCID by acting as CBF1 corepressors.

ANIMAL MODEL

Studies of the pathogenesis of SCA1 have supported a model in which the
expanded glutamine tract in the ATXN1 gene causes toxicity by modulating
the normal activities of that gene. To explore native interactions that
modify the toxicity of ATXN1, Bowman et al. (2007) generated a targeted
duplication of mouse Ataxn1l and tested the role of this protein in SCA1
pathology. Using a knockin mouse model of SCA1 that recapitulates the
selective neurodegeneration seen in affected individuals, Bowman et al.
(2007) found that elevated Atxn1l levels suppressed neuropathology by
displacing mutant Atxn1 from its native complex with Capicua (CIC;
612082). The results provided genetic evidence that the selective
neuropathology of SCA1 arises from modulation of a core functional
activity of ATXN1, and they underscored the importance of studying the
paralogs of genes mutated in neurodegenerative diseases to gain insight
into mechanisms of pathogenesis.

606886	TITLE *606886 RNA-BINDING MOTIF PROTEIN 6; RBM6
;;DEF3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Gure et al. (1998) identified RBM6, which they called NY-LU-12, by
immunoscreening a recombinant lung cancer cDNA expression library with
autologous patient serum. They cloned the full-length cDNA from normal
testis mRNA through a combination of 5-prime RACE and direct PCR. In
addition to the dominant transcript, they identified 3 minor forms that
contain additional exon(s). The deduced 1,123-amino acid major protein
contains 20 inexact 6-amino acid repeats close to the N terminus; 2
RNA-binding domains; 2 zinc finger motifs; a bipartite nuclear
localization signal; and a 4-residue nuclear localization pattern. They
noted that all of the predicted functional domains in RBM6 are also
present in RBM5 (606884), with which it shares 30% identity. Northern
blot analysis detected several RBM6 transcripts, ranging from
approximately 3 to 4.4 kb, in all tissues examined. Highest expression
was in liver, with intermediate expression in placenta, lung, skeletal
muscle, and kidney. Southern blot analysis showed no evidence of
homozygous deletion of RBM6 in tumor cell lines, the gene being
partially deleted in only 1 of 9 lung cancer cell lines.

Drabkin et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA encoding RBM6, which they called
DEF3, by positional cloning from a small cell lung carcinoma homozygous
deletion region on chromosome 3p21.3. The human and mouse RBM6 proteins
share 89% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis indicated highest
expression in heart, intermediate levels in brain, placenta, liver,
skeletal muscle, and pancreas, and low expression in lung and kidney. In
hematopoietic tissues, highest expression was in lymph node and thymus,
with lower expression in bone marrow. Two bands were observed in
peripheral blood leukocytes and fetal liver. Northern blot analysis
showed constitutive expression of mouse Rbm6 during embryogenesis, as
well as expression in all adult mouse tissues examined.

Timmer et al. (1999) identified a YAC clone corresponding to chromosome
3p21.3 that is deleted in the small cell lung cancer cell line GLC20.
They isolated and cloned RBM6 by direct hybridization of this YAC clone
to a lung cDNA library. Northern blot analysis identified RBM6
transcripts of 4.7, 3.9, and 2.1 kb in all tissues tested. Although RBM6
maps to the critical region homozygously deleted in a small cell lung
carcinoma cell line, the authors found that the 5-prime end crosses the
telomeric breakpoint of the deletion. Northern and Southern analyses of
a number of lung cancer cell lines revealed no patterns of aberrant RBM6
expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Drabkin et al. (1999) found that recombinant proteins containing the RNA
recognition motifs of RBM5 or RBM6 specifically bind poly(G) RNA
homopolymers in vitro.

GENE STRUCTURE

Timmer et al. (1999) determined that the RBM6 gene contains 20 exons.

MAPPING

Timmer et al. (1999) identified the RBM5 gene within a YAC clone
corresponding to chromosome 3p21.3. By FISH, Heng et al. (2000) mapped
the mouse gene to chromosome 9F1-F2.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Interstitial deletions of the short arm of chromosome 3 are found in a
large number of tumors. By comparative genomic hybridization, deletions
of 3p are frequently detected in breast, cervix, bladder, renal cell,
and small cell lung carcinomas. Microscopically detectable interstitial
deletions of 3p21 are found in a variety of tumors. Loss of
heterozygosity studies have shown frequent deletions of the 3p21.3
region in carcinomas of lung, kidney, head and neck, breast, and
bladder. Following up on these strong suggestions of the presence of 1
or more tumor suppressor genes on 3p, Szeles et al. (1997) used an
experimental system, the elimination test, to identify a 1-Mb segment,
referred to as the chromosome 3 common eliminated region-1, or C3CER1.
C3CER1 was also covered by a PAC contig. Using the sequence of 2
overlapping PACs from C3CER1, Kiss et al. (1999) localized the cDNA
encoding the precursor of mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LARS2;
604544). They also characterized a novel human LIM domain-containing
gene, LIMD1, and its mouse ortholog. LIM domains consist of a
cysteine-rich consensus sequence containing 2 distinct zinc-binding
subdomains, which mediate protein-protein interactions. The predicted
protein sequences of the human and mouse genes show 3 LIM domains
located at the C-terminal end, indicating that these genes belong to
group 3 of the gene family encoding the LIM motifs. The predicted human
LIMD1 protein contains 676 amino acids. Northern blot analysis indicated
that both the mouse and human genes are ubiquitously expressed, with
human LIMD1 being expressed predominantly as a 7.5-kb transcript. The
LIM motif had been previously identified in many developmentally
important factors from various eukaryotes. These factors had been shown
to play a role in intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation,
and cellular differentiation during development. Thus, the
C3CER1-located LIMD1 gene deserves further study for its possible role
in tumor suppression.

By immunofluorescence microscopy of a human osteoblast cell line, Sharp
et al. (2004) localized LIMD1 predominantly to the cytoplasm, with
strongest staining in a punctate perinuclear distribution. Some LIMD1
localized to the nucleus, but not to nucleoli. Using a nuclear export
blocker, Sharp et al. (2004) showed that LIMD1 shuttles between the
cytoplasm and nucleus.

GENE FUNCTION

Sharp et al. (2004) found that LIMD1 specifically interacted with the
retinoblastoma protein (RB1; 614041) in HeLa cells, and the interaction
required amino acids 404 through 442, just prior to the 3 C-terminal LIM
domains. The interaction between LIMD1 and RB1 inhibited E2F (see E2F1;
189971)-mediated transcription and suppressed expression of a majority
of genes with E2F1-responsive elements. LIMD1 blocked tumor growth in
vitro and in vivo, and was downregulated in a majority of human lung
cancer samples examined.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kiss et al. (1999) characterized the genomic structure of the human
LIMD1 gene and found that the coding region of LIMD1 contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Kiss et al. (1999) mapped the LIMD1 gene to 3p21. They assigned
the mouse homolog to the chromosome 9F subtelomeric region using FISH.

124050	TITLE *124050 D-AMINO ACID OXIDASE; DAO
;;DAMOX;;
DAAO
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DAO gene encodes D-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3), one of the
principal and characteristic flavoenzymes of peroxisomes found in the
liver, kidney, and brain of many mammalian species. DAO has a flavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as the prosthetic group and catalyzes the
oxidative deamination of a wide range of D-amino acids but is inactive
on naturally occurring L-amino acids (summary by Barker and Hopkinson,
1977).

CLONING

Fukui and Miyake (1992) isolated genomic clones for the entire DAO gene
from human placental genomic libraries, with the aid of a previously
cloned cDNA with human DAO as a probe. The 347-amino acid protein has a
molecular mass of 39.4 kD. They noted that DAO has been intracellularly
localized to peroxisomes.

Mitchell et al. (2010) found expression of the DAO gene in gray matter
of the spinal cord and cerebellum, including motor neurons and Purkinje
cells, respectively. DAO was also expressed in glial cells but not in
the motor cortex. DAO contains FAD binding and dimer interaction
domains, as well as a TrkA potassium uptake signature, an aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetase class I signature, and a D-amino acid oxidase signature.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fukui and Miyake (1992) determined that the DAO gene contains 11 exons
and spans 20 kb.

MAPPING

With the use of genomic DNAs prepared from human/Chinese hamster somatic
hybrid cells as templates for PCR, Fukui and Miyake (1992) localized the
DAO gene to human chromosome 12.

The DAO gene maps to chromosome 12q24 (Mitchell et al., 2010).

GENE FUNCTION

Barker and Hopkinson (1977) found neither polymorphisms nor rare genetic
variants of the DAO gene, which they abbreviated DAMOX. The biologic
role of DAO and DDO (124450) has been thought to be protection against
L-amino acids of fungi, bacteria and insects, or contribution to
acid-base balance in the kidney. Alternatively, they may be merely
fossil enzymes, i.e., relics of our evolutionary past.

DAAO is expressed in human brain, where it oxidizes D-serine, a potent
activator of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor (see
602717). Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Chumakov et al. (2002)
identified DAAO as an interacting partner of the G72 protein (607408).
The interaction between G72 and DAAO was confirmed in vitro and shown to
result in activation of DAAO.

Molla et al. (2006) characterized recombinant human DAAO expressed in E.
coli. The recombinant protein was catalytically active and converted the
oxidized form of the FAD cofactor to the reduced state following
addition of D-alanine under anaerobic conditions. Gel permeation
chromatography revealed that native DAAO was a dimer in solution, and
each monomer noncovalently bound FAD. DAAO showed higher catalytic
efficiency and substrate affinity toward D-alanine and D-proline than
D-serine. It also oxidized D-aspartate and glycine, but it had low
affinity for these substrates. Steady-state and presteady-state
measurements indicated that DAAO followed a sequential kinetic
mechanism.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association With Schizophrenia

Chumakov et al. (2002) found 4 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
markers from DAAO that were associated with schizophrenia (181500) in
the same Canadian case/control samples that led to the identification of
G72. Logistic regression revealed genetic interaction between associated
SNPs in the vicinity of 2 genes. Chumakov et al. (2002) concluded that
association of both DAAO and G72 with schizophrenia, together with
activation of DAAO by a G72 protein product, pointed to the involvement
of this N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor regulation pathway in
schizophrenia.

- Possible Association With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

In a 3-generation kindred with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS; 105400), Mitchell et al. (2010) found linkage to markers D12S1646
and D12S354 on chromosome 12q24 (2-point lod score of 2.7). Screening of
candidate genes identified a heterozygous arg199-to-trp (R199W) mutation
in exon 7 of the DAO gene in 3 affected members and in 1 obligate
carrier who died at age 73 years of cardiac failure and reportedly had
right-sided weakness and dysarthria. The proband had onset at age 40,
and the mean age at death in 7 cases was 44 years (range, 42 to 55
years). The R199W mutation was also present in 3 at-risk individuals of
33, 44, and 48 years of age, respectively. Arg199 is highly conserved
between mammalian and lower organisms such as yeast, fungi, and
bacteria, and lies close to the FAD-binding site. The mutation was not
found in 780 Caucasian controls. Postmortem examination of the obligate
carrier showed some loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and
degeneration of 1 of the lateral corticospinal tracts. There was
markedly decreased DAO enzyme activity in the spinal cord compared to
controls. Coexpression of mutant protein with wildtype protein in COS-7
cells indicated a dominant-negative effect of the mutant protein. Rat
neuronal cell lines expressing mutant protein showed decreased viability
and increased ubiquitinated aggregates compared to wildtype. A
pathogenic role for the accumulation of D-serine was postulated.
Mitchell et al. (2010) suggested a role for the DAO gene in ALS but
noted that a causal role for the R199W-mutant protein remained to be
unequivocally established.

Millecamps et al. (2010) sequenced the DAO gene in 126 unrelated French
patients with familial ALS and identified a heterozygous arg38-to-his
(R38H) variant in exon 2 in a mother and daughter with classic
adult-onset ALS. The variant was also found in 1 of 1,016 control
chromosomes, indicating that it is a rare polymorphism. They did not
find the R199W variant in their patients. Millecamps et al. (2010)
stated that their data neither confirmed nor excluded the possibility
that DAO mutations may be associated with ALS in rare families. In a
reply, de Belleroche and Morris (2010) noted that the data reported by
Millecamps et al. (2010) should not alter the interpretation of their
previous findings (Mitchell et al., 2010), which showed that the R199W
mutation segregated with disease, promoted formation of ubiquitinated
protein aggregates, and reduced motor neuron survival.

ANIMAL MODEL

Inhibition or disruption of Dao leads to increased levels of D-serine in
the mouse brain, serum, and spinal cord, and is associated with
increased NMDA-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents. Zhang et al.
(2011) found that Dao-null mice had enhanced prepulse inhibition (PPI)
compared to controls. When treated with a competitive NMDA antagonist,
the mutant mice had increased sensitivity to the PPI-disruptive effect.
Mutant mice also showed increased learning and exploratory behavior that
was not related to anxiety. The findings suggested that Dao-null mice
might have altered functioning of NMDA receptors due to increased
amounts of D-serine, but there was only modest support for manipulations
of DAO activity as a potential therapeutic approach to treat
schizophrenia.

611240	TITLE *611240 G PROTEIN-REGULATED INDUCER OF NEURITE OUTGROWTH 2; GPRIN2
;;GRIN2;;
KIAA0514
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned GPRIN2, which they designated
KIAA0514. The transcript contains repetitive elements in its 3-prime
UTR, and the deduced 461-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 66 kD. RT-PCR of human tissues detected low expression in kidney
and lung.

By database analysis using mouse Gprin1 (611239) as probe, Chen et al.
(1999) identified human GPRIN2, which they called GRIN2. The deduced
461-amino acid sequence shares high homology with GPRIN1 and GPRIN3
(611241) over the C-terminal region (Iida and Kozasa, 2004). Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues detected expression in brain only, and
Northern blot analysis of human brain regions found expression
restricted to the cerebellum.

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant GPRIN2 expressed in insect cells, as well as
immunoprecipitation studies from transfected COS cells, Chen et al.
(1999) and Iida and Kozasa (2004) showed that GPRIN2 interacted
specifically with G-alpha-o (GNAO1; 139311) and G-alpha-z (GNAZ; 139160)
bound to GTP-gamma-S and GDP-AlF4(-), but did not interact with
GDP-bound forms of either G protein subunit. Chen et al. (1999) showed
that coexpression of GPRIN1 or GPRIN2 with activated G-alpha-o caused
formation and extension of neurite-like processes in mouse neuroblastoma
cells.

POPULATION GENETICS

By analyzing short-read mapping depth for 159 human genomes, Sudmant et
al. (2010) demonstrated accurate estimation of absolute copy number for
duplications as small as 1.9 kb pairs, ranging from 0 to 48 copies.
Sudmant et al. (2010) identified 4.1 million 'singly unique nucleotide'
positions informative in distinguishing specific copies and used them to
genotype the copy and content of specific paralogs within highly
duplicated gene families. These data identified human-specific
expansions in genes associated with brain development, such as GPRIN2
and SRGAP2 (606524), which have been implicated in neurite outgrowth and
branching. Also included were the brain-specific HYDIN2 gene (610813),
associated with micro- and macrocephaly; DRD5 (126453), a dopamine D5
receptor; and the GTF2I (601679) transcription factors, whose deletion
has been associated with visual-spatial and sociability deficits among
Williams-Beuren syndrome (194050) patients, among others. The data of
Sudmant et al. (2010) also revealed extensive population genetic
diversity, especially among the genes NPEPPS (606793), UGT2B17 (601903),
and NBPF1 (610501), as well as LILRA3 (604818), which is the most highly
stratified gene by copy number in the human genome. In addition, Sudmant
et al. (2010) detected signatures consistent with gene conversion in the
human species.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the GPRIN2
gene to chromosome 10.

603033	TITLE *603033 COLLAGENIC TAIL OF ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE; COLQ
;;ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE-ASSOCIATED COLLAGEN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The COLQ gene encodes a collagen-like strand that associates into a
triple helix to form a tail that anchors catalytic subunits of
acetylcholinesterase (ACHE; 100740) to the basal lamina.

Asymmetric AChE is the major form of AChE at the endplate of the
neuromuscular junction in higher vertebrates. Asymmetric AChE is
composed of the T isoform of ACHE, ACHE(T), linked to a triple helical
COLQ tail. AChE rapidly hydrolyzes acetylcholine released at cholinergic
synapses in the nervous system, thus limiting the number of collisions
between ACh and the ACh receptor (AChR), and the duration of the
synaptic response (Ohno et al., 1998).

CLONING

Krejci et al. (1991) cloned ColQ from Torpedo. Krejci et al. (1997)
cloned the rat and mouse ColQ genes, and found that the ColQ subunits
form homotrimers and attach to AChE. Northern blot analysis detected
ColQ expression in cholinergic tissues, brain, muscle, and heart, as
well as in noncholinergic tissues such as lung and testes.

Ohno et al. (1998) used mouse ColQ primers to isolate human COLQ cDNA
from a human adult skeletal muscle cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a
deduced 455-amino acid protein with 89% homology to the rodent ColQ
peptide. Conserved domains include a secretion signal peptide, a
proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) that interacts with AChE(T), 2
cysteines that form disulfide bonds with AChE(T), a collagen domain,
conserved cysteines that stabilize the tripal helical domain, and
proteoglycan binding domains that anchor the tripal helical domain to
the basal lamina. Several alternative transcripts were identified.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ohno et al. (1998) determined that the COLQ gene spans approximately 50
kb and comprises 17 constitutive exons and 2 alternatively transcribed
exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Ohno et al. (1998) mapped the
COLQ gene to chromosome 3p25. By radiation hybrid analysis, Donger et
al. (1998) mapped the COLQ gene to chromosome 3p24.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with endplate AChE deficiency (EAD; 603034), Ohno et al.
(1998) identified 6 recessive mutations in the COLQ gene
(603033.0001-603033.0006). Coexpression of each of the 6 ColQ mutants
with wildtype AChE(T) in SV40-transformed monkey kidney fibroblast (COS)
cells showed that a mutation proximal to the ColQ attachment domain for
AChE(T) prevented association of ColQ with AChE(T); mutations distal to
the attachment domain generated a mutant species of acetylcholinesterase
composed of 1 AChE(T) tetramer and a truncated ColQ strand. The authors
concluded that the mutations prevented the insertion of the gene product
into the basal lamina.

In 6 sibs with a mild form of endplate AChE deficiency, Donger et al.
(1998) identified a homozygous mutation in the COLQ gene (603033.0007).

Shapira et al. (2002) reported 3 novel mutations in the COLQ gene in 8
patients with variable features of EAD: 1 patient was a compound
heterozygote; the other 7 patients, 6 Palestinian Arabs and 1 Iraqi Jew,
were all homozygous for a gly240-to-ter mutation (G240X; 603033.0010),
suggesting a founder mutation. Expression studies of the 3 mutations in
COS-7 cells showed that each prevented formation of insertion competent
asymmetric AChE.

ANIMAL MODEL

Feng et al. (1999) generated ColQ -/- mice to study the roles played by
ColQ and AChE in synapses and elsewhere. Such mice failed to thrive and
most died before reaching maturity. They completely lacked asymmetric
AChE in skeletal and cardiac muscles, specifically at the neuromuscular
junction and in the brain. Nonetheless, neuromuscular function was
present. A compensatory mechanism appeared to be a partial ensheathment
of nerve terminals by Schwann cells. Such mice also lacked the
asymmetric forms of Bche (177400). Surprisingly, globular AChE tetramers
were absent as well, suggesting a role for the ColQ gene in assembly or
stabilization of AChE forms that do not contain a collagenous subunit.

ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, 215-BP DEL, NT107

In a patient with endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency (603034),
Ohno et al. (1998) found deletion of 215 basepairs following nucleotide
107 of the COLQ gene. The deletion was caused by skipping of exons 2 and
3, causing a frameshift after codon 35. The mutation abolished the
proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) and predicted 25 missense codons
followed by a stop codon. The mutation was present in compound
heterozygous state with the E214X mutation (603033.0002). The deletion
mutation was inherited from the mother and the truncating mutation from
the father.

In a patient with EAD (603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified a

In a patient with EAD (603034), Ohno et al. (1998) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the COLQ gene: an arg282-to-ter
(R282X) mutation and a 1-bp deletion (1082delC). The R282X mutation
truncated COLQ 10 codons upstream to the C-terminal end of the collagen
domain. The 1-bp deletion caused a frameshift after codon 360,
predicting 64 missense codons followed by a stop codon; 1082delC spared
the entire collagen domain but abolished the C-terminal domain of COLQ.

frameshift after codon 262, predicting 36 missense codons followed by a

asymptomatic parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

In 6 affected sibs in a consanguineous Spanish family with EAD (603034),
Donger et al. (1998) identified a homozygous tyr431-to-ser (Y431S)
substitution in the conserved C-terminal domain of COLQ. The mutation
was predicted to disturb the attachment of collagen-tailed
acetylcholinesterase to the neuromuscular junction. Donger et al. (1998)
referred to the disorder in these patients as CMS Ic (for congenital
myasthenic syndrome type Ic). The authors noted that most previously
described CMS Ic patients had a marked decrease in total muscle
acetylcholinesterase with essentially no collagen-tailed forms. These
forms were present in affected members of the Spanish family but the
defect interfered with attachment to the neuromuscular junction.

(1999) found that the splice site mutation resulted in skipping of exon
16. The mutant splice donor site of intron 16 harbors 5 discordant
nucleotides (at -3, -2, +3, +4, and +6) that do not basepair with U1
small nuclear (sn) RNA (RNU1; 180680), the RNA responsible for splice
donor site recognition. Versions of the minigene harboring, at either +4
or +6, nucleotides complementary to U1 snRNA restored normal splicing.
Analysis of 1,801 native splice donor sites revealed that the presence
of a G nucleotide at +3 is associated with preferential usage, at
positions +4 to +6, of nucleotides concordant to U1 snRNA. Analysis of
11 disease-associated IVS+3A-G mutations indicated that, on average, 2
of 3 nucleotides at positions +4 to +6 failed to basepair, and that the
nucleotide at +4 never basepaired, with U1 snRNA. Ohno et al. (1999)
concluded that, with G at +3, normal splicing generally depends on the
concordance that residues at +4 to +6 have with U1 snRNA, but other
cis-acting elements may also be important in assuring the fidelity of
splicing.

ENDPLATE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE DEFICIENCY
COLQ, GLY240TER

In 6 Palestinian Arabs and 1 Iraqi Jew with variable features of EAD
(603034), Shapira et al. (2002) identified a homozygous 718G-T
transition in a splice acceptor consensus sequence of exon 12 of the
COLQ gene, resulting in a gly240-to-ter (G240X) mutation and causing
premature termination of the protein. The mutation prevented proper
formation of asymmetric AChE in COS-7 cells. The patients demonstrated
phenotypic variability, including differences in age of onset, disease
progression, respiratory and feeding difficulties, severity of weakness,
and ophthalmoplegia.

611914	TITLE *611914 TSC22 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 4; TSC22D4
;;TSC22 HOMOLOGOUS GENE 1; THG1;;
TSC22-LIKE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSC22D4 is a member of the TSC22 domain family of leucine zipper
transcriptional regulators (see TSC22D3; 300506) (Kester et al., 1999;
Fiorenza et al., 2001).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse brain cDNA library using TSC22D1
(607715) as bait, followed by database analysis, Kester et al. (1999)
cloned human and mouse TSC22D4, which they called THG1. The deduced
395-amino acid human protein contains a TSC box and leucine zipper
region and has a calculated molecular mass of 41 kD. TSC22D4 shares
similarity with TSC22D1, TSC22D3, KIAA0669, and Drosophila
'shortsighted' shs over the TSC box leucine zipper domain.

Fiorenza et al. (2001) used differential screening by subtractive
hybridization of cDNAs isolated from embryonic day 12.5 wildtype and
Lhx3 (LHX4; 602146) mutant mouse pituitaries to clone mouse Tsc22d4,
which they called Thg-1pit. The 387-amino acid mouse protein shares 79%
amino acid identity with human TSC22D4.

Fiorenza et al. (2001) showed that mouse Tsc22d4 expression in the
pituitary cell line GH3 was induced in response to TGF-beta (TGFB1;
190180). RT-PCR assays detected Tsc22d4 expression during mouse
embryonic development with expression first detected at stage 98.5
followed by a sharp increase during the next 24 hours that coincided
with initiation of Lhx3 expression and preceded formation of the
pituitary rudiment. A second increase in Tsc22d4 expression at embryonic
day 12.5 coincided with development of Rathke's pouch. Tsc22d4
expression was also detected in the entire central nervous system. In
contrast, Tsc22d4 expression in Lhx3 mutant mouse embryos showed an
absence of pituitary expression of Tsc22d4 although expression in the
rest of the brain was no different from wildtype. Fiorenza et al. (2001)
concluded that Tsc22d4 is regulated by Lhx3 during pituitary
organogenesis.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, gel shift assay, and GST pull-down
experiments, Kester et al. (1999) confirmed that TSC22D4 interacts with
TSC22D1 by forming heterodimers. They demonstrated that TSC22D4 has
transcriptional repressor activity.

;;KENAE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using Isaac syndrome patient serum to immunoscreen an NB-1 human
neuroblastoma cell cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE, Araya et al.
(2009) cloned full-length CCDC125, which they called Kenae. The deduced
511-amino acid protein has 4 coiled-coil domains. Real-time PCR detected
variable Ccdc125 expression in all mouse tissues examined, with highest
expression in thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. Epitope-tagged CCDC125
localized to the cytoplasm of transfected HEK293 cells. Orthologs of
CCDC125 were detected only in vertebrates.

GENE FUNCTION

By overexpression in HEK293 cells, Araya et al. (2009) showed that
CCDC125 inhibited migration in a wound healing cell migration assay.
CCDC125 both increased constitutive activation of the small GTPases RHOA
(165390), RAC1 (602048), and CDC42 (116952) and reduced their
responsiveness to extracellular stimuli. CCDC125 did not appear to
directly bind the small GTPases.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the CCDC125 gene to chromosome 5q13.2 based on an
alignment of the CCDC125 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL832658) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;NUDIX MOTIF 2;;
AP4A HYDROLASE 1; APAH1
DESCRIPTION AP4A hydrolase is the enzyme responsible for maintaining the
intracellular level of the dinucleoside AP4A (diadenosine
5-prime,5-triple prime-P(1),P(4)-tetraphosphate). Human AP4A hydrolase
is a member of the MutT (600312) motif, or 'nudix,' family of nucleotide
hydrolases, whose function may be to rid the cell of toxic nucleotide
metabolites. Thorne et al. (1995) isolated an AP4A hydrolase cDNA from a
human fetal liver and spleen normalized cDNA library. The gene,
designated APAH1, encodes a 147-amino acid polypeptide containing a MutT
sequence motif.

McLennan et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map
the APAH1 gene to human chromosome 9p13. They further localized the gene
relative to other genes and markers in the region and obtained the order
tel--D9S165--D9S1878--CNTFR (118946)--IL11RA (600939)--APAH1--GALT
(606999)--D9S163--CHH (250250)--D9S50--cen.

McLennan et al. (1998) suggested that, in light of evidence for the
existence of several tumor suppressor genes in the 9p13 region, and also
given that the mammalian AP3A hydrolase gene (FHIT; 601153) is a
possible tumor suppressor gene, APAH1 may be a candidate tumor
suppressor gene as well.

612927	TITLE *612927 AVL9, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; AVL9
;;KIAA0241
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from an immature myeloid leukemia cell
line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned partial AVL9, which they
designated KIAA0241. Northern blot analysis detected low expression in
brain, lung, testis, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas,
spleen, ovary, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes.

By database analysis, Harsay and Schekman (2007) identified AVL9, which
shares 31% and 27% identity across 2 conserved regions with yeast Avl9.
They identified a protein superfamily, which they designated Avl
nine-related (ANR), that includes ANR1 (DUF1630/FAM116A), ANR2
(KIAA1147), and ANR3 (FAM45A).

GENE FUNCTION

Using a synthetic lethal screen designed to identify new secretory
mutants in yeast, Harsay and Schekman (2007) identified S. cerevisiae
Avl9 as a protein whose absence confers a lethal phenotype in a yeast
Vps1/Apl2 double-null mutant. By subcellular fractionation and other
studies, Harsay and Schekman (2007) showed that loss of S. cerevisiae
Avl9p caused a general transport or sorting defect at the Golgi
characterized by disruption of secretory vesicle generation and defects
in actin polarization/polarized growth. Overexpression of Avl9p resulted
in vesicle accumulation and a post-Golgi secretory defect.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the AVL9 gene
to chromosome 7.

300560	TITLE *300560 PHD FINGER PROTEIN 8; PHF8
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 422; ZNF422;;
KIAA1111
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned PHF8, which they designated
KIAA1111. The deduced 1,084-amino acid protein contains a PHD finger
motif. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest PHF8 expression in ovary.
Expression was intermediate in all other adult and fetal tissues and
specific brain regions examined.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped the PHF8 gene
to chromosome X.

GENE FUNCTION

Loenarz et al. (2010) reported that recombinant PHF8 is an Fe(II) and
2-oxoglutarate-dependent N-epsilon-methyl lysine demethylase, which acts
on histone substrates. PHF8 is selective in vitro for N-epsilon-di- and
monomethylated lysine residues and does not accept trimethyl substrates.
Clinically observed mutations to the PHF8 gene cluster in exons encoding
for the double-stranded beta-helix fold and are expected to disrupt
catalytic activity. The PHF8 F279S mutation (300560.0004), which is
associated with mild MR, mild dysmorphic features, and cleft lip and
palate, modifies a conserved hydrophobic region, rendering the enzyme
catalytically inactive. Loenarz et al. (2010) hypothesized that
dependence of PHF8 activity on oxygen availability may explain an
association between maternal hypoxia and facial clefting.

Qi et al. (2010) provided multiple lines of evidence establishing PHF8
as the first monomethyl histone H4 lysine-20 (H4K20me1) demethylase,
with additional activities towards histone H3K9me1 and me2. PHF8 is
located around the transcriptional start sites of approximately 7,000
RefSeq genes and in gene bodies and intergenic regions. PHF8 depletion
resulted in upregulation of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 at the transcriptional
start site and H3K9me2 in the nontranscriptional start sites,
respectively, demonstrating differential substrate specificities at
different target locations. PHF8 positively regulates gene expression,
which is dependent on its H3K4me3-binding PHD and catalytic domains.
Importantly, patient mutations significantly compromised PHF8 catalytic
function. PHF8 regulates cell survival in the zebrafish brain and jaw
development, thus providing a potentially relevant biologic context for
understanding the clinical symptoms associated with PHF8 patients.
Lastly, genetic and molecular evidence supported a model whereby PHF8
regulates zebrafish neuronal cell survival and jaw development in part
by directly regulating the expression of the homeodomain transcription
factor MSX1/MSXB (605558), which functions downstream of multiple
signaling and developmental pathways. Qi et al. (2010) concluded that
their findings indicated that an imbalance of histone methylation
dynamics has a critical role in X-linked mental retardation.

Liu et al. (2010) reported that PHF8, while using multiple substrates,
including H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me2, also functions as an H4K20me1
demethylase.

PHF8 is recruited to promoters by its PHD domain based on interaction
with H3K4me2/3 and controls G1-S transition in conjunction with E2F1,
HCF1 (300019), and SET1A (611052), at least in part, by removing the
repressive H4K20me1 mark from a subset of E2F1-regulated gene promoters.
Phosphorylation-dependent PHF8 dismissal from chromatin in prophase is
apparently required for the accumulation of H4K20me1 during early
mitosis, which might represent a component of the condensin II loading
process. Accordingly, the HEAT repeat clusters in 2 non-structural
maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) condensin II subunits, NCAPD3 (609276)
and NCAPG2 (608532), are capable of recognizing H4K20me1, and ChIP-Seq
analysis demonstrated a significant overlap of condensin II and H4K20me1
sites in mitotic HeLa cells. Thus, Liu et al. (2010) concluded that the
identification and characterization of an H4K20me1 demethylase, PHF8,
has revealed an intimate link between this enzyme and 2 distinct events
in cell cycle progression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In the affected males with Siderius X-linked mental retardation syndrome
(300263) reported by Siderius et al. (1999), Laumonnier et al. (2005)
identified a deletion in the PHF8 gene (300560.0001). Subsequent
screening of another family with mental retardation and similar clinical
features revealed a nonsense mutation in PHF8 (300560.0002).

Koivisto et al. (2007) identified a mutation in the PHF8 gene
(300560.0004) in 2 Finnish brothers with X-linked mental retardation and
cleft lip/cleft palate.

607754	TITLE *607754 MAKORIN 1; MKRN1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Makorin ring finger protein-1 gene (MKRN1) is a highly transcribed,
intron-containing source for a family of intronless mammalian genes
encoding a novel class of zinc finger proteins. Phylogenetic analyses
indicate that the MKRN1 gene is the ancestral founder of this gene
family (Gray et al., 2000).

CLONING

Gray et al. (2000) cloned MKRN1 orthologs from human, mouse, wallaby,
chicken, fruit fly, and nematode, underscoring the age and conservation
of this gene. The human MKRN1 cDNA contains a contiguous sequence of
3,026 basepairs including an open reading frame (ORF) from nucleotide
121 to 1567 that encodes a putative protein of 482 amino acids. Mouse
and Drosophila Mkrn1 proteins share 92% and 27% with the human protein,
respectively, with Drosophila Mkrn1 reaching 63% identity over 123 amino
acids spanning from upstream of the RING finger through the C-terminal
C3H zinc finger. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a
single prominent 3.2-kb transcript, suggesting that the MKRN1 gene is
highly and uniformly expressed in all tissues, including different
regions of the brain. High levels were observed in murine embryonic
nervous system and adult testis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system, Kim et al. (2005) found that MKRN1
interacts with a C-terminal domain of TERT (187270), the catalytic
subunit of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein. They demonstrated that
MKRN1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting TERT ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation. Mutation of his307 of MKRN1 or deletion of
its C-terminal RING finger domain inactivated the enzyme. Overexpression
of MKRN1 in telomerase-positive human cells decreased telomerase
activity and reduced telomere length. Kim et al. (2005) concluded that
MKRN1 plays a negative role in telomere homeostasis.

GENE FAMILY

The MKRN gene family encodes putative ribonuclear proteins with a
distinctive array of zinc finger motifs, including 2 to 4 C3H zinc
fingers, an unusual cys/his arrangement that may represent a novel zinc
finger structure, and a highly conserved RING zinc finger. Gray et al.
(2000) provided a summary of 9 MKRN family loci distributed throughout
the human genome.

GENE STRUCTURE

The MKRN1 gene consists of 8 exons and spans approximately 28 kb (Gray
et al., 2000).

MAPPING

By FISH and interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, Gray et al.
(2000) determined that the human and mouse MKRN1 loci map to a conserved
syntenic group proximal to the T-cell receptor-beta cluster (TCRB; see
186930) in chromosome 7q34-q35 in human and chromosome 6A in mouse.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hirotsune et al. (2003) reported that transgenic disruption of a
putative pseudogene, Mkrn1-p1, resulted in destabilization of Mkrn1 mRNA
in trans and generated a phenotype with polycystic kidneys and bone
deformity. Gray et al. (2006) were unable to replicate the findings of
Hirotsune et al. (2003). They showed that 5-prime Mkrn1-p1 is fully
methylated on both alleles, indicative of silenced chromatin, and that
Mkrn1-p1 is not transcribed and therefore cannot stabilize Mkrn1
transcripts in trans. They determined that the putative Mkrn1-p1
reported by Hirotsune et al. (2003) is actually a short splice variant
of the Mkrn1 gene. Mice in which Mkrn1 had been directly disrupted
showed none of the phenotypes attributed by Hirotsune et al. (2003) to a
partial reduction of an Mkrn1 isoform. In addition, Gray et al. (2006)
found that Mkrn1-p1 appeared specific to mouse; it was not found in any
other species, including rat.

610591	TITLE *610591 RHO GTPase-ACTIVATING PROTEIN 27; ARHGAP27
;;CIN85-ASSOCIATED MULTIDOMAIN-CONTAINING RhoGAP1; CAMGAP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Rho (see ARHA; 165390)-like small GTPases are involved in many cellular
processes, and they are inactive in the GDP-bound state and active in
the GTP-bound state. GTPase-activating proteins, such as ARHGAP27,
inhibit Rho-like proteins by stimulating their intrinsic GTPase activity
(Katoh and Katoh, 2004).

CLONING

Sakakibara et al. (2004) cloned rat Arhgap27, which they called Camgap1,
and by database analysis, they identified human ARHGAP27. Both deduced
proteins contain an N-terminal SH3 domain, followed by 3 WW motifs, a
proline-rich region, a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal
RhoGAP domain. Northern blot analysis of murine tissues detected highest
expression in kidney, lung, small intestine, and thymus.

By searching databases for sequences similar to ARHGAP12 (610577), Katoh
and Katoh (2004) cloned 2 variants of ARHGAP27 that differed in their
5-prime sequences due to utilization of alternative first exons. The
deduced proteins differed at their N-terminal ends. The full-length
protein contains 889 amino acids, and the N-terminally truncated protein
contains 548 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

By biochemical analysis, Sakakibara et al. (2004) determined that the
recombinant RhoGAP domain of rat Camgap1 induced the GTPase activity of
Rac1 (602048) and Cdc42 (116952), but not RhoA. Protein binding and
expression studies indicated that the second SH3 domain of CIN85
(SH3KBP1; 300374) bound to the proline-rich region of Camgap1.
Overexpression of the 3 WW domains of rat Camgap1, but not the
full-length protein, interfered with receptor (TFRC; 190010)-mediated
endocytosis of transferrin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the ARHGAP27 gene contains 18
exons and spans over 36.3 kb. Alternate first exons provide alternative
promoters.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the ARHGAP27
gene to chromosome 17q21.

614428	TITLE *614428 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR AP2-EPSILON; TFAP2E
;;AP2-EPSILON
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the AP2 family of transcription factors, such as TFAP2E,
contain an N-terminal activation domain and a C-terminal basic
helix-loop-helix dimerization and DNA-binding domain. AP2 proteins bind
to and regulate the promoters and enhancers of numerous genes involved
in a wide spectrum of physiologic processes during development, cell
cycle, and differentiation (summary by Tummala et al., 2003).

CLONING

Tummala et al. (2003) cloned full-length mouse Tfap2e, which they called
Ap2-epsilon, from skin RNA. They identified human AP2-epsilon by
database analysis. The mouse and human AP2-epsilon proteins both contain
442 amino acids, and they share 92% identity. Both have domain
structural characteristics of AP2 proteins, including a PY motif in the
N-terminal activation domain. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues
showed strong expression of an approximately 2.1-kb Ap2-epsilon
transcript in skin, with weak expression in stomach, and no expression
in other tissues examined. RT-PCR analysis detected AP2-epsilon
expression in human skin, primary human keratinocytes, and human
keratinocyte and cervical cancer cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Tummala et al. (2003) found that recombinant mouse Ap2-epsilon, like all
other AP2 proteins tested, bound the consensus AP2-binding site
(CCTGCAGGC) in the promoter regions of keratin-1 (KRT1; 139350) and
keratin-14 (KRT14; 148066). An N-terminally truncated Ap2-epsilon
protein also bound these keratin promoter sequences.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tummala et al. (2003) determined that the TFAP2E gene contains 7 exons
and spans over 23 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tummala et al. (2003) mapped the TFAP2E
gene to chromosome 1p34.3.

602845	TITLE *602845 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 3C; KIF3C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library with probes based on a
sequence in the expressed sequence tag (EST) database, Telford et al.
(1998) cloned a novel kinesin-related gene. The full-length cDNA
sequence predicted a 793-amino acid polypeptide that was 98% identical
to that of the mouse Kif3c gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that
KIF3C expressed a 5.0-kb mRNA in brain and 3 smaller mRNAs in all tested
tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR and DNA sequence analysis of PAC clones, Telford et al. (1998)
found that the human KIF3C gene consists of 8 exons spanning 12 kb.

MAPPING

Telford et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
KIF3C gene to human chromosome 2p23. They used interspecific backcross
analysis to map the gene to mouse chromosome 12.

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF3C belongs to the
kinesin-2 family.

603460	TITLE *603460 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 5, REGULATORY SUBUNIT 1; CDK5R1
;;NEURONAL CDK5 ACTIVATOR; NCK5A;;
CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 5, REGULATORY PARTNER, 35-KD; p35(NCK5A);;
p35
p25, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are CDC2 (116940)-related kinases that
bind to cyclin to form active holoenzymes that play a pivotal role in
the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5
(CDK5; 123831) is found in several tissues in adult mouse, but brain is
the only tissue that shows Cdk5 histone H1 kinase activity, suggesting
that a CDK5 regulatory subunit is responsible for the activation of CDK5
in brain. Lew et al. (1994) determined the protein sequence of bovine
brain p25, a regulatory subunit of Cdk5. Tsai et al. (1994) isolated
p35, a 35-kD protein in rat neuronal cells that acts a regulatory
subunit for Cdk5. They found that p35 is a phosphoprotein and a
potential substrate for the Cdk5 kinase.

By screening a human fetal brain cDNA library with a partial bovine p25
cDNA, Tsai et al. (1994) isolated p35 cDNAs. Sequence analysis of the
predicted 307-amino acid protein revealed that it is nearly identical to
p25. The authors stated that it seems likely that p25 is a proteolytic
fragment of p35. The p35 protein activated CDK5 histone H1 kinase
activity in vitro and in vivo. In situ hybridization indicated that p35
and Cdk5 are expressed in similar patterns in embryonic mouse brains.
Based on the overlapping expression patterns and association of p35 and
CDK5, and the observation that p35 is a potent and specific activator of
CDK5 kinase, Tsai et al. (1994) concluded that p35 is a regulatory
subunit for CDK5. However, p35 appears to be a novel type of regulatory
partner for the CDKs, because its primary structure is only marginally
similar to that of vertebrate cyclins and p35 is expressed at the
highest level in terminally differentiated, rather than proliferating,
cells.

CDK5 is required for proper development of the mammalian central nervous
system. To be activated, CDK5 must associate with its regulatory
subunit, p35. Patrick et al. (1999) showed that p25, a truncated form of
p35, accumulates in neurons in the brains of patients with Alzheimer
disease (104300). This accumulation correlated with an increase in CDK5
kinase activity. Unlike p35, p25 was not readily degraded, and binding
of p25 to CDK5 constitutively activated CDK5, changed its cellular
location, and altered its substrate specificity. In vivo, the p25/CDK5
complex hyperphosphorylated tau (157140), which reduced tau's ability to
associate with microtubules. Moreover, expression of the p25/CDK5
complex in cultured primary neurons induced cytoskeletal disruption,
morphologic degeneration, and apoptosis. Patrick et al. (1999) concluded
that cleavage of p35, followed by accumulation of p25, may be involved
in the pathogenesis of cytoskeletal abnormalities and neuronal death in
neurodegenerative diseases.

Lee et al. (2000) described the mechanism of conversion of p35 to p25.
In cultured primary cortical neurons, excitotoxins, hypoxic stress, and
calcium influx induced the production of p25. In fresh brain lysates,
addition of calcium can stimulate cleavage of p35 to p25. Specific
inhibitors of calpain (see 114220), a calcium-dependent cysteine
protease, effectively inhibit the calcium-induced cleavage of p35. In
vitro, calpain directly cleaves p35 to release a fragment with relative
molecular mass 25,000. The sequence of the calpain cleavage product
corresponds precisely to that of p25. Application of amyloid beta
peptide A-beta(1-42) (see 104760) induced the conversion of p35 to p25
in primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, inhibition of cdk5 or calpain
activity reduced cell death in amyloid beta-treated cortical neurons.
Lee et al. (2000) concluded that cleavage of p35 to p25 by calpain may
be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.

By inclusion within a mapped clone (GENBANK AC002119), the p35 gene maps
to human chromosome 17 (Rasooly, 1999). Ohshima et al. (1996) mapped the
Cdk5r gene to mouse chromosome 11.

Ohshima et al. (1996) isolated genomic clones and cDNAs encoding Cdk5r,
the mouse p35 homolog. The mouse gene had no introns in the coding
region.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chae et al. (1997) found that mice lacking p35 displayed severe cortical
lamination defects and suffered from sporadic adult lethality and
seizures. Neuronal birth-dating experiments indicated a reversed packing
order of cortical neurons such that earlier-born neurons resided in
superficial layers and later-generated neurons occupied deep layers.
Kwon and Tsai (1998) reported that the migration of the earliest-born
cortical plate neurons is normal in p35 mutant mice, but cortical
neurons subsequently generated remain underneath these neurons. They
suggested that the p35/Cdk5 kinase is required for cortical plate
neurons to migrate past preexisting neurons and take up superficial
positions to constitute the inside-outside layering order of cortical
lamination.

Mice deficient in p35 show abnormal development of the neocortex,
characterized by inverted layering. In p35 null mice, Gupta et al.
(2003) found that the classic modes of radial neuronal migration, somal
translocation and locomotion, were largely replaced by a distinct mode
of migration, called branched migration. Branched migration is cell
autonomous and associated with impaired neuronal-glial interactions. The
authors noted that mice deficient for reelin (600514) and Dab1 (603448),
which also show disrupted cortical layering, do not show branching
morphology, suggesting distinct signaling pathways.

Pareek et al. (2006) found high expression of Cdk5 and p35 in primary
afferent nociceptive C fibers in mouse dorsal root ganglia. Induction of
inflammation in peripheral nerves resulted in increased levels of Cdk5,
p35, and p25. P35-null mice showed delayed responses to painful thermal
stimulation, whereas transgenic mice overexpressing p35 were
hypersensitive to painful stimuli compared to controls. Pareek et al.
(2006) concluded that Cdk/p35 plays a role in primary afferent
nociceptive signaling.

612168	TITLE *612168 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 39 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 3; SLC39A3
;;ZRT- AND IRT-LIKE PROTEIN 3; ZIP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequences of fungal and plant zinc
transporters, Gaither and Eide (2000) identified 3 human members of the
ZIP superfamily: ZIP1 (SLC39A1; 604740), ZIP2 (SLC39A2; 612166), and
ZIP3 (SLC39A3). The 3 deduced human proteins share greater than 49%
similarity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SLC39A3
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH81024).

GENE FUNCTION

Desouki et al. (2007) noted that normal human prostate glandular
epithelium has the unique function of accumulating high levels of zinc
and that in prostate cancer this capability is lost as an early event in
the development of the malignant cells. By immunohistochemistry analysis
of human normal and malignant prostate tissue sections, they determined
that, like SLC39A1, both SLC39A2 and SLC39A3 are downregulated in
malignant cells in situ along with the depletion of zinc levels. SLC39A2
and SLC39A3 were localized predominantly at the apical cell membrane,
which is in contrast to the SLC39A1 localization at the basolateral
membrane. Desouki et al. (2007) suggested that SLC39A1 is important for
the extraction of zinc from circulation as the primary source of
cellular zinc, whereas SLC39A2 and SLC39A3 are important for retention
of the zinc in the cellular compartment. They proposed that zinc is a
tumor suppressor agent and that SLC39A1, SLC39A2, and SLC39A3 are tumor
suppressor genes.

490000	TITLE *490000 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN, Y-LINKED; ZFY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ZFY gene is actively transcribed in males and appears to be involved
in sperm or testis maturation (summary by Dorit et al., 1996).

CLONING

Page et al. (1987) identified a Y-encoded zinc finger protein,
designated ZFY, which they thought might represent the
testis-determining factor (TDF). They cloned a 230-kb segment of the
human Y chromosome thought to contain some or all of the TDF gene. The
cloned region spanned the deletion in a female who carried all but 160
kb of the Y. Homologous sequences were found within this sex-determining
region of the mouse Y chromosome. The nucleotide sequence of this
conserved DNA on a human Y chromosome suggested that it encodes a
protein with multiple 'finger' domains, as first described in frog
transcription factor IIIA. The encoded protein was thought to bind to
nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner and to regulate
transcription.

GENE FUNCTION

Using PCR, Palmer et al. (1990) showed close similarity of ZFY and ZFX
(314980). They demonstrated the expression of both genes in a wide range
of adult and fetal human tissues and showed that ZFX is expressed from
an inactive X chromosome present in human-mouse hybrids. Palmer et al.
(1989) presented genetic evidence that ZFY is not the testis-determining
factor (see SRY, 480000): they observed XX males lacking ZFY. In 4 XX
males lacking ZFY, they found an exchange of Y-specific sequences next
to the pseudoautosomal boundary, thereby defining the region in which
TDF must lie.

MAPPING

Muller and Schempp (1989) assigned the ZFY gene to Yp11.32 by in situ
hybridization.

CYTOGENETICS

Models of sex determination must accommodate the finding of a
ZFY-related locus on the X chromosome. The presence of similar sequences
in birds suggested a possible role not only in the XX/XY sex
determination system of mammals, but also in the ZZ/ZW system of birds.
Mapping studies by hybridization to DNA from somatic cell hybrids
containing various fragments of the X chromosome suggested that the
sequence on the X chromosome maps to region Xp22.3-p21. Page et al.
(1987) advanced several hypotheses to explain the existence of the
X-linked locus. One hypothesis was inconsistent with the prevailing
notion of a dominantly acting sex-determining factor unique to the Y
chromosome. This model suggested that the X and Y loci are functionally
interchangeable, that both are testis determining, and that the X locus
is subject to X-chromosome inactivation. According to this model, sex is
determined by the total number of expressed X and Y loci: a single dose
is female-determining, while a double (or greater) dose is
male-determining. The addition of an X-derived transgene to the genome
of an XX embryo should result in testis differentiation, as long as that
transgene is not subject to X inactivation. Increased expression of the
X-chromosomal locus could explain the presence of testicular tissue in
XX hermaphrodites and the rare Y-negative XX males, who lack the TDF
locus of the Y chromosome. Although some XY females lack TDF as judged
by Y-DNA analysis, others do not have discernible deletions. These
unexplained XY females may have point mutations in TDF or in genes that
function in conjunction with or downstream of TDF. The model mentioned
above suggests that mutation in the X-chromosomal locus (at Xp22.3-p21)
could cause XY embryos to develop as females.

EVOLUTION

Sinclair et al. (1988) showed that in marsupials sequences homologous to
ZFY (and ZFX) map not to the X and Y but to autosomes. This implies that
ZFY is not the primary sex-determining gene in marsupials.

Mahaffey et al. (1997) concluded that the human ZFY gene has 2 mouse
homologs, designated Zfy1 and Zfy2, which apparently arose by an
intrachromosomal duplication of an ancestral gene on the Y chromosome.
Zambrowicz et al. (1994) characterized the promoters of the murine Zfy1
and Zfy2 genes.

Dorit et al. (1995) found no polymorphism of the 729-bp intron located
immediately upstream of the ZFY zinc finger exon in a sample of 38
individuals chosen to represent a cross-section of geographic origins.
This was surprising to the authors because interspecific comparisons
with other nonhuman primates revealed phylogenetically informative
sequence changes. The invariance likely resulted from either a recent
selective sweep, a recent origin for modern homo sapiens, recurrent male
population bottlenecks, or historically small affected male population
sizes. Fu and Li (1996) used what they called a more rigorous method and
showed that the most recent common ancestor of present humans may have
been only half as long ago as the estimate made by Dorit et al. (1995):
270,000 years, with 95% confidence limits of 0 to 800,000. Three other
groups (Donnelly et al., 1996; Weiss and von Haeseler, 1996; and Rogers
et al., 1996) also commented on the question of the age of the most
recent common ancestor (MRCA), and Dorit et al. (1996) offered a
response. They commented that, given the small number of changes taking
place along the branches and nodes of this gene tree, their original
data should not be used as a 'molecular clock.'

Genes located on the mammalian Y chromosome outside the pseudoautosomal
region do not recombine with those on the X chromosome and are predicted
to either undergo selection for male function or gradually degenerate
because of an accumulation of deleterious mutations. Slattery et al.
(2000) performed phylogenetic analyses of X-Y homologs Zfx and Zfy among
26 felid species, which indicated 2 ancestral episodes of directed
genetic exchange (ectopic gene conversion) from X to Y: once during the
evolution of the pallas cat and once in a common predecessor of ocelot
lineage species. Replacement of the more rapidly evolving Y homolog with
the evolutionarily constrained X copy may represent a mechanism for
adaptive editing of functional genes on the nonrecombining region of the
mammalian Y chromosome.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Le Coniat et al. (1992) cloned a cDNA encoding a nuclear 43-kD
glycoprotein, identified as the G hnRNP protein. They designated the
gene HNRPG. The HNRPG cDNA has 60% homology with RBMY1A1.

Mazeyrat et al. (1999) isolated and sequenced 2 Rbmx mouse cDNA clones,
which they named Rbmx1 and Rbmx2, with distinct 3-prime ends. RT-PCR
showed that both Rbmx transcripts are ubiquitously expressed. Mazeyrat
et al. (1999) concluded that, based on the absence of intronic sequence,
the mouse Hnrpg gene is a retroposon derived from Rbmx.

GENE FUNCTION

The genes on the human Y chromosome fall into 2 classes with distinct
evolutionary origins. Widely expressed, single-copy genes with X
homologs that escape inactivation (X-Y shared genes) derive from the
ancient proto X-Y chromosome pair. Testis-specific, multicopy genes with
no X homologs originate from autosomes and have accumulated on a
'selfish Y' because of their male-specific function. Copies of genes in
the RBMY gene family (see RBMY1A1, 400006) are candidate spermatogenesis
genes because they are found in all 3 azoospermia factor (AZF) deletion
intervals on the human Yq, which are associated with oligospermia or
azoospermia (Vogt et al., 1997). An active X-borne homolog of the
Y-borne RBMY gene was demonstrated in humans and marsupials by Delbridge
et al. (1999) and in the mouse by Mazeyrat et al. (1999). Delbridge et
al. (1999) stated that, like other gene pairs on the X and Y chromosomes
(e.g., DFFRX/DFFRY; see 400005), RBMX retained a widespread function and
RBMY evolved a male-specific function in spermatogenesis. Thus, RBMY1A1,
far from belonging to a 'second class' of testis-specific elements, is a
diverged X-Y shared gene.

Venables et al. (2000) used a yeast 2-hybrid system to show that the
RBMY gene product hnRNPG and a novel testis-specific relative (termed
hnRNPG-T) interact with Tra2-beta (TRA2B; 602719), an activator of
pre-mRNA splicing that is ubiquitous but highly expressed in testis. The
RBMY gene product and Tra2-beta colocalized in 2 major domains in human
spermatocyte nuclei. Incubation with the protein interaction domain of
the RBMY gene product inhibited splicing in vitro of a specific pre-mRNA
substrate containing an essential enhancer bound by Tra2-beta. The
RNA-binding domain of RBM affected 5-prime splice site selection. The
authors concluded that the hnRNPG family of proteins is involved in
pre-mRNA splicing and hypothesized that RBM may be involved in
Tra2-beta-dependent splicing in spermatocytes.

Using in vivo splicing assays, Hofmann and Wirth (2002) identified
hnRNPG and its paralog RBM as splicing factors that promoted the
inclusion of SMN2 (601627) exon 7. Both hnRNPG and RBM nonspecifically
bound RNA, but directly and specifically bound Htra2-beta1, an SR-like
splicing factor which stimulates inclusion of exon 7 through a direct
interaction with SMN2 exon 7 pre-mRNA. Using deletion mutants of hnRNPG,
the authors demonstrated a specific protein-protein interaction of
hnRNPG with Htra2-beta1, which mediated the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7
rather than the nonspecific interaction of hnRNPG with SMN pre-mRNA.
These trans-acting splicing factors were also effective on endogenous
SMN2 transcripts and increased the endogenous SMN protein level. The
authors presented a model of how exon 7 mRNA processing may be regulated
by these splicing factors.

Nasim et al. (2003) showed that HNRNPG and the splicing activator
protein TRA2B have opposite effects upon the incorporation of several
exons, and that both are capable of acting as either an activator or a
repressor. HNRNPG acts via a specific sequence to repress the skeletal
muscle-specific exon (SK) of human slow skeletal alpha-tropomyosin
(TPM3; 191030), and stimulates inclusion of the alternative nonmuscle
exon. The binding of HNRNPG to the exon is antagonized by TRA2B. The 2
proteins also have opposite effects upon a dystrophin (300377)
pseudoexon. This exon was incorporated to a higher level in patient
heart muscle than skeletal muscle, causing X-linked dilated
cardiomyopathy. Cotransfection with HNRNPG repressed incorporation in
cardiac myoblasts, whereas TRA2B increased it in skeletal myoblasts. The
authors proposed that the HNRNPG/TRA2B ratio may contribute to cellular
splicing preferences, and that the higher proportion of HNRNPG in
skeletal muscle may play a role in preventing the incorporation of the
pseudoexon and thus in preventing skeletal muscle dystrophy.

MAPPING

Delbridge et al. (1999) mapped the RBMX gene to human Xq26 by FISH. By
PCR analysis of human/mouse hybrid cell lines, Mazeyrat et al. (1999)
demonstrated mapping of the HNRPG-homologous structural gene to the
human X chromosome. By FISH, they mapped the mouse Rbmx gene to XA3-XA5,
a region sharing homology of synteny with human Xq26. Mazeyrat et al.
(1999) localized the Hnrpg retroposon, which they renamed Rbmxrt, to
mouse chromosome 14.

- PSEUDOGENES

Le Coniat et al. (1992) had mapped the HNRPG gene to chromosome 6p12 by
radioactive in situ hybridization. Delbridge et al. (1999) found that
the HNRPG locus on 6p12 represents a processed pseudogene and considered
it likely that this and other intronless copies with nucleotide homology
to the HNRPG cDNA on chromosomes 1, 4, 9, 11, and the X chromosome were
derived by retrotransposition from RBMY-like sequence on the human X
chromosome. They suggested that the erroneous localization of the HNRPG
cDNA probably occurred because of the preferential hybridization of the
cDNA clone to the processed pseudogene on chromosome 6. Delbridge et al.
(1999) proposed that the HNRPG locus be renamed RBMXP1.

601683	TITLE *601683 COQ7, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; COQ7
;;CLK1, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the nematode C. elegans, the activity of clk1 controls the rate of
worm development, the pace of behaviors, and the time of death. Ewbank
et al. (1997) identified the C. elegans clk1 gene. They showed that the
predicted 187-amino acid clk1 protein is conserved among eukaryotes,
including humans, and they cloned partial cDNAs representing the human
and mouse homologs. The clk1 protein is structurally similar to the S.
cerevisiae metabolic regulator Cat5 (also called Coq7). These proteins
contain a tandem duplication of a core 82-residue domain.

Asaumi et al. (1999) cloned the mouse homolog of clk1, designated Coq7.
They cloned the human COQ7 cDNA by screening a liver cDNA library with
the mouse cDNA as probe. Human COQ7 encodes a deduced 217-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 24.3 kD. The protein shares
85%, 89%, 53%, and 37% sequence identity with orthologs from mouse, rat,
C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae, respectively. COQ7 transfected into COS-7
cells shows a single band of about 25 kD by Western blot analysis.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 0.9-kb COQ7 transcript
in heart and skeletal muscle, with barely detectable expression in
brain, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas.

Takahashi et al. (2001) cloned Coq7 from a mouse diaphragm cDNA library
and found that the deduced 217-amino acid protein has an N-terminal,
38-residue mitochondria targeting sequence. Immunofluorescence
localization of Coq7 revealed punctate staining in the cytoplasm of
skeletal muscle and heart muscle, in smooth muscle cells surrounding
small blood vessels, and in renal tubule cells. Coq7 transfected into
COS-7 cells gave a punctate staining pattern consistent with
mitochondrial localization, and transfection with Coq7 lacking the
putative mitochondria targeting sequence led to diffuse cytoplasmic
staining.

Vajo et al. (1999) cloned COQ7 from human heart. They found that the
predicted protein contains 179 amino acids, is mostly helical, and
contains an alpha-helical membrane insertion. It has a potential
N-glycosylation site, a phosphorylation site for protein kinase C and
another for casein kinase II, and 3 N-myristoylation sites. Northern
blot analysis detected 3 transcripts; a 1-kb transcript was predominant
in heart, and a 3-kb transcript was predominant in skeletal muscle,
kidney, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Ewbank et al. (1997) noted that the timing of a wide range of
physiologic processes is deregulated and the life span is extended in C.
elegans clk1 mutants. Mutations in clk1, clk2 (TELO2; 611140), clk3, and
gro1 interact genetically to affect developmental rate and longevity.
They demonstrated that the clk1 gene complemented the clk1 phenotypes
and restored normal longevity. They also showed that clk1 complements
the phenotype of S. cerevisiae Cat5/Coq7 null mutants, demonstrating
that the 2 genes share biochemical function and that clk1 acts at the
level of cellular physiology.

In yeast, Coq7/Cat5 is essential for several metabolic pathways,
including ubiquinone biosynthesis, respiration, and gluconeogenic gene
activation. Jonassen et al. (1998) demonstrated that the Coq7/Cat5 gene
product is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein directly involved in
ubiquinone biosynthesis. They showed that the defect in gluconeogenic
gene activation in coq7/cat5 null mutants is a general consequence of a
defect in respiration. Jonassen et al. (1998) stated that these results
obtained in the yeast model suggest that the effects on development and
life span in C. elegans clk1 mutants may relate to changes in the amount
of ubiquinone, an essential electron transport component and a
lipid-soluble antioxidant.

Guarente (1997) discussed the relevance of the studies in yeast and
nematode to the understanding of human aging.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR amplification and Southern blot analysis on human genomic DNA,
Asaumi et al. (1999) determined that the COQ7 gene contains 6 exons and
spans 11 kb. Analysis of the putative promoter region revealed an Alu-J
subfamily consensus sequence, and CAAT box- and TATA box-like sequences.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and radiation
hybrid analysis, Asaumi et al. (1999) mapped the COQ7 gene to chromosome
16p12.3-p11. By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Vajo et al. (1999)
mapped the gene to 16p13.1-p12.

601789	TITLE *601789 PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS FACTOR 13; PEX13
;;PEROXIN 13
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PEX13 gene encodes peroxisome biogenesis factor-13, a peroxisomal
membrane protein that acts as an essential docking factor for the import
of peroxisomal matrix proteins containing the C-terminal peroxisomal
uptake-targeting signal PTS1 (Gould et al., 1996).

CLONING

By studying yeast mutants deficient in import of peroxisomal proteins,
Gould et al. (1996) identified a novel integral peroxisomal membrane
protein in both yeast and humans that binds the PTS1 receptor via a
cytoplasmically oriented SH3 domain. They designated the protein Pex13p
(PEX13).

Elgersma et al. (1996) identified the same protein in S. cerevisiae.

Bjorkman et al. (1998) determined that human PEX13 cDNA encodes a
deduced 403-residue protein product with a calculated molecular mass of
44.3 kD.

By EST database searching, Fransen et al. (1998) identified a second
isoform of PEX13 containing an additional 39 proline-rich amino acids at
the N terminus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bjorkman et al. (1998) reported that the PEX13 gene spans approximately
11 kb and contains 4 exons, 1 more than previously thought.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Bjorkman et al. (1998) mapped the
PEX13 gene to chromosome 2p15.

GENE FUNCTION

Gould et al. (1996) concluded that PEX13 functions as a docking factor
for the predominantly cytoplasmic PTS1 receptor.

Elgersma et al. (1996) showed that a point mutation in the C-terminal
SH3 domain of the Pex13p protein inactivated the protein but did not
affect its membrane targeting. A 2-hybrid screen with the SH3 domain of
Pex13p identified Pex5p (600414), a receptor for proteins with a PTS1
signal as its ligands. Pex13p SH3 interacted specifically with Pex5p in
vitro. They found that Pex5p was present mainly in the cytosol and only
a small fraction was associated with peroxisomes. Therefore, Elgersma et
al. (1996) proposed that Pex13p is a component of the peroxisomal
protein import machinery onto which the mobile pex5p receptor docks for
the delivery of the selected PTS1 protein. Erdmann and Blobel (1996)
showed that cells deficient in Pex13p are unable to import peroxisomal
matrix proteins containing PTS1 and, surprisingly, also those containing
PTS2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Shimozawa et al. (1999) reported that the complete human cDNA encoding
PEX13 rescued peroxisomal matrix protein import and its assembly in
fibroblasts from peroxisome biogenesis disorder patients of
complementation group H. They detected mutations in the human PEX13 cDNA
in 2 patients of group H (see, e.g., 601789.0001 and 601789.0002).

Liu et al. (1999) characterized the sole representative of
complementation group 13 of the PBDs, a patient with neonatal
adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD; see 614885). The fibroblasts of this patient
(designated PBD222) displayed defects in the import of multiple
peroxisomal matrix proteins. However, residual matrix protein import
could be detected in the cells from the patient, consistent with the
relatively mild phenotype. PEX13 encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein
with a cytoplasmically exposed SH3 domain, and Liu et al. (1999) found
that expression of human PEX13 restored peroxisomal matrix protein
import in cells from patient PBD222. Furthermore, these cells were found
to be homozygous for an I326T mutation (601789.0002), which Shimozawa et
al. (1999) had independently and simultaneously demonstrated.

In 2 unrelated Saudi patients with Zellweger syndrome (PBD11A; 614883),
Al-Dirbashi et al. (2009) identified different homozygous deletions
involving the PEX13 gene (601789.0003, 601789.0004).

ANIMAL MODEL

Maxwell et al. (2003) found that Pex13 null mouse pups exhibited many of
the clinical features of Zellweger syndrome, including intrauterine
growth retardation, severe hypotonia, failure to feed, and neonatal
death. These mice lacked morphologically intact peroxisomes and showed
deficient import of matrix proteins containing either type-1 or type-2
peroxisome targeting signals. Biochemical analysis of tissue and
cultured skin fibroblasts from these animals indicated severe impairment
of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and plasmalogen synthesis. The
brains of these mice showed disordered lamination in the cerebral
cortex, consistent with a neuronal migration defect.

In a patient with a severe Zellweger syndrome phenotype (PBD11A;
614883), Shimozawa et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a nonsense
mutation, trp234-to-ter (W234X), which resulted in the loss of not only
the SH3 domain but also the putative transmembrane domain of the PEX13
protein.

614885), whose fibroblasts showed the temperature-sensitive phenotype,
Shimozawa et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a missense mutation,
ile326 to thr (I326T), in the SH3 domain of the PEX13 protein.
Expression studies of this mutant PEX13 cDNA in a PEX13-defective CHO
mutant showed I326T to be a temperature-sensitive mutation and thus
suggested that the PEX13 protein with the I326T mutation in the SH3
domain is stable at 30 degrees C but is somewhat unstable at 37 degrees
C.

Liu et al. (1999) independently identified homozygosity for the I326T
mutation in the cells of patient PBD222. This patient was described by
Shimozawa et al. (1998).

PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 11A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX13, 147-KB DEL

In a Saudi boy, born of consanguineous parents, with Zellweger syndrome
(PBD11A; 614883), Al-Dirbashi et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
147-kb deletion that included the PEX13 gene in addition to 70-kb
upstream and 45.7-kb downstream regions, predicted to disrupt the
hypothetical genes FLJ32312 and KIAA1841. Both deletion breakpoints
occurred within Alu repeats. The patient was admitted to the neonatal
intensive care unit after birth with severe hypotonia. He had a large
anterior fontanel and high forehead. Brain MRI showed polymicrogyria,
lissencephaly, and poor myelination, and EEG showed cortical dysfunction
and seizure activity. He died at 6 weeks of age of cardiopulmonary
arrest. Fibroblast peroxisomes showed a classic 'ghost' appearance due
to abnormal protein import, and complementation studies indicated
complementation group H (group 13). The deletion was predicted to result
in complete loss of PEX13 function.

PEROXISOME BIOGENESIS DISORDER 11A (ZELLWEGER)
PEX13, 14-BP DEL, EXON 2

In a Saudi boy, born of consanguineous parents, with Zellweger syndrome
(PBD11A; 614883), Al-Dirbashi et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
14-bp deletion in exon 2 of the PEX13 gene, resulting in a frameshift
and premature termination. The patient was admitted to the neonatal
intensive care unit shortly after birth because of severe hypotonia,
where he showed recurrent apnea, seizures, and elevated liver enzymes.
Renal ultrasound showed multiple cysts. He had dysmorphic facies with
anteverted nostrils, a depressed nasal bridge, and a large, triangular
face. At age 6 months, he showed severe failure to thrive, progressive
hepatic dysfunction, and global developmental delay. Fibroblast
peroxisomes showed a classic 'ghost' appearance due to abnormal protein
import, and complementation studies indicated complementation group H
(group 13). The deletion was predicted to result in complete loss of
PEX13 function.

604698	TITLE *604698 A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN 12; AKAP12
;;A-KINASE ANCHOR PROTEIN, 250-KD; AKAP250;;
GRAVIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A-kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449) direct the activity of
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911) by tethering the enzyme near its
physiologic substrates.

CLONING

By screening an endothelial cDNA expression library with serum from a
myasthenia gravis (MG; 254200) patient, Gordon et al. (1992) isolated a
partial cDNA encoding a 250-kD cytoplasmic protein, which the authors
termed gravin. They found that gravin is expressed in endothelial cells,
cultured fibroblasts, and osteosarcoma cells, but not in platelets,
leukocytes, or monocytic cell lines. In erythroleukemic cell lines,
gravin is expressed after phorbol ester induction. Indirect
immunofluorescence of permeabilized cells revealed a trabecular network
of gravin staining. Anti-gravin antibodies were present in the sera of
22 of 72 MG patients but were absent in the sera of 50 normal
individuals and present in the sera of only 1 of 72 patients with other
autoimmune diseases.

By screening fetal brain and adult heart cDNA libraries with
radiolabeled regulatory (R) II subunit PKA as a probe, Nauert et al.
(1997) isolated a cDNA fragment that showed sequence similarity to
gravin. Using this fragment to screen a human heart cDNA library, they
determined that gravin is a novel member of the AKAP family (AKAP12).
The AKAP12 protein has 1,780 amino acids and contains an amphipathic
alpha helix, the structure that binds RII, at residues 1540 to 1553.
Binding studies with fragments of gravin confirmed the binding to RII
and also determined that AKAP12 binds to and inhibits protein kinase C
(PKC; see 176960) in a phosphatidylserine-dependent manner.
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy of permeabilized cells showed
that RII PKA and AKAP12 are colocalized at the cell periphery.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium assigned the
AKAP12 gene to chromosome 6q24-q25 (TMAP stSG30260).

GENE FUNCTION

The blood-brain barrier is essential for maintaining brain homeostasis
and low permeability. Both astrocytes and oxygen tension are believed to
play a role in the development of the blood-brain barrier.

By use of cDNA representational difference analysis to identify
blood-brain barrier maturation factors regulated by oxygen in
astrocytes, Lee et al. (2003) found that expression of the rat gene
SSeCKS (AKAP12), an ortholog of human gravin, was decreased by hypoxia
and upregulated by reoxygenation at the transcriptional level.
SSeCKS-overexpressing astrocytes decreased the expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 192240) via reduction of the AP1
transcription factor (165160), and stimulated expression of
angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1; 601667), an antipermeability factor in
astrocytes, resulting in repression of angiogenesis in vitro and in
vivo. SSeCKS increased the expression of tight junction proteins in
endothelial cells. Lee et al. (2003) concluded that SSeCKS regulates
blood-brain barrier differentiation by modulating both brain
angiogenesis and tight junction formation.

162641	TITLE *162641 NEUROPEPTIDE Y RECEPTOR Y1; NPY1R
;;NPYR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Neuropeptide Y (NPY; 162640) is one of the most abundant neuropeptides
in the mammalian nervous system and exhibits a diverse range of
important physiologic activities, including effects on psychomotor
activity, food intake, regulation of central endocrine secretion, and
potent vasoactive effects on the cardiovascular system. Two major
subtypes of NPY (Y1 and Y2) have been defined by pharmacologic criteria.
NPY receptors, such as NPY1R, have been identified in a variety of
tissues, including brain, spleen, small intestine, kidney, testis,
placenta, and aortic smooth muscle (Herzog et al., 1992).

CLONING

Herzog et al. (1992) reported cloning of a cDNA encoding a human NPY
receptor which they confirmed to be a member of the G protein-coupled
receptor superfamily.

Larhammar et al. (1992) independently cloned and characterized the
neuropeptide Y receptor.

GENE FUNCTION

Herzog et al. (1992) found that, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) or human embryonic kidney cells, the NPY receptor exhibited
characteristic ligand specificity. In the kidney cell line, the receptor
was coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein that mediated the
inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation. In the CHO cell line, on the
other hand, the receptor was coupled not to inhibition of adenylate
cyclase but rather to the elevation of intracellular calcium. Thus the
second messenger coupling of the NPY receptor was cell type specific,
depending on the specific repertoire of G proteins and effector systems
present in the cell type.

Wild social strains of C. elegans aggregate the presence of specific
sensory cues, but solitary strains do not. Macosko et al. (2009)
identified the RMG inter/motor neuron as the central site of action of
the neuropeptide receptor gene npr-1, which distinguishes solitary
strains (high npr-1 activity) from wild social strains (low npr-1
activity). High RMG activity is essential for all aspects of social
behavior.

GENE STRUCTURE

Herzog et al. (1993) determined the molecular organization and
regulation of the human NPY Y1 receptor gene. In contrast to the
contiguous structure of most G protein-coupled receptor genes, they
found that the NPY Y1 receptor gene has 3 exons. They also identified a
common PstI polymorphism in the first intron of the gene.

MAPPING

By high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization, Herzog et al.
(1993) localized the NPY1R gene to chromosome 4q31.3-q32.

Herzog et al. (1997) found that the NPY1R and NPY5R (602001) genes are
colocalized on chromosome 4q31-q32. The 2 genes are transcribed in
opposite directions from a common promoter region. One of the
alternately spliced 5-prime exons of the Y1 receptor gene is a part of
the coding sequence of the Y5 receptor. This unusual arrangement
suggested to Herzog et al. (1997) that the 2 genes arose by a gene
duplication event and that they may be coordinately expressed.

By interspecific backcross analysis, Lutz et al. (1997) mapped the Npy1r
and Npy2r genes to conserved linkage groups on mouse chromosomes 8 and
3, respectively, which correspond to the distal region of human
chromosome 4q.

ANIMAL MODEL

Naveilhan et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in NPY1R by targeted
disruption. Npy1r -/- mice developed hyperalgesia to acute thermal,
cutaneous, and visceral chemical pain, and exhibited mechanical
hypersensitivity. Neuropathic pain was increased and the mice showed a
complete absence of the pharmacologic analgesic effects of NPY. In the
periphery, Y1 receptor activation was sufficient and required for
substance P release and the subsequent development of neurogenic
inflammation and plasma leakage. Naveilhan et al. (2001) concluded that
the Y1 receptor is required for central physiologic and pharmacologic
NPY-induced analgesia and that its activation is both sufficient and
required for the release of substance P and initiation of neurogenic
inflammation.

Cavadas et al. (2006) found that Npy caused secretion of catecholamine
in primary cultures of mouse adrenal chromaffin cells and that this
controlled release was abolished in cultures from Npy1r-null mice.
Adrenal catecholamine content and constitutive release of catecholamine
were increased in Npy1r-null mice. Catecholamine plasma concentrations
were higher in resting Npy1r-null mice than in resting wildtype mice.
Analysis of the adrenal glands of both genotypes revealed no differences
in the medulla, cortex, and X zone. The high turnover of adrenal
catecholamine in Npy1r-null mice was explained by enhanced tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH; 191290) activity, although no change in the affinity of
the enzyme was observed. In a human neuroblastoma cell line expressing
NPY1R, NPY markedly inhibited expression of a reporter gene driven by a
rat TH promoter sequence, suggesting molecular interaction between NPY1R
and TH. Cavadas et al. (2006) concluded that NPY controls the release
and synthesis of catecholamine from the adrenal medulla and consequently
contributes to sympathoadrenal tone.

306250	TITLE *306250 COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR 2 RECEPTOR, ALPHA; CSF2RA
;;GRANULOCYTE-MACROPHAGE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR RECEPTOR, LOW AFFINITY,
ALPHA SUBUNIT; GMCSFR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF, or CSF2;
138960) activates STAT5 (601511) and other signaling pathways via
binding to a cell surface receptor composed of a ligand-binding alpha
subunit, encoded by CSF2RA, and a nonbinding affinity-enhancing beta
subunit, encoded by CSF2RB (138981) (Suzuki et al., 2008).

CLONING

Using an expression cloning strategy, Gearing et al. (1989) isolated a
cDNA encoding CSF2RA, which they called GMCSFR, from a human placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 400-amino acid precursor protein has a
22-amino acid signal peptide. The 378-amino acid mature protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 43.7 kD and contains a single transmembrane
domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain, and a short
intracytoplasmic tail. Northern blot analysis detected GMCSFR expression
in a variety of hemopoietic cells displaying GMCSF binding.

Raines et al. (1991) identified a truncated, soluble form of the
low-affinity GMCSF receptor in choriocarcinoma cells. Clones encoding
the soluble receptor were identical in sequence to the membrane-bound
form except for a 97-nucleotide deletion. The amino acid sequence of
this deleted cDNA predicted a protein that lacks the 84 C-terminal amino
acids of the membrane-bound receptor, including the transmembrane and
cytoplasmic domains, and contains 16 different amino acids at its C
terminus. RNase protection analysis indicated that this variant cDNA was
derived from a naturally occurring mRNA. Soluble receptors had been
identified for several other hematopoietin receptors and may be a
general feature of this class. It is likely that alternative mRNA
splicing is the mechanism by which the soluble counterparts are
generated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rappold et al. (1992) found that the CSF2RA gene spans at least 45 kb.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of a panel of mouse-human somatic cell
hybrids, Gough et al. (1990) demonstrated that the CSF2R gene is on the
X chromosome. The possibility that an allele also maps to the Y
chromosome was suggested by the observation that many DNA samples from
normal males carry 2 alleles of this gene. Among 65 normal persons, 23
females and 20 males were homozygous for an allele of fragment A,
whereas 8 females and 14 males were heterozygous. By in situ
hybridization, Gough et al. (1990) showed that the CSF2R gene maps to
the tip of the short arm of the X chromosome and the short arm of the Y
chromosome (see 425000), with the most likely localization being
Xpter-p21 and Ypter-p11.2. Although this information was consistent with
its location in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), conclusive proof
required study of segregation of the locus with respect to sexual
phenotype. They found in a total of 14 informative male meioses, 3
recombination events; i.e., in 2 cases a daughter had inherited the
allele from the paternal Y chromosome, and in 1 instance a son had
inherited the allele from the paternal X chromosome. Thus, the CSF2R
locus is distal to the MIC2 locus (313470), which shows only about 2.5%
recombination and maps close to the PAR boundary. This was the first
localization of a gene of known function to this region, which
encompasses about 2,500 kb.

By pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Rappold et al. (1992) localized the
CSF2RA gene 1,180 to 1,300 kb from the telomere, in close proximity to
the CpG island B5. The gene showed abundant hypervariable sequences, and
a number of informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms were
defined. Rappold et al. (1992) suggested that these polymorphisms might
be useful in proving the pseudoautosomal inheritance of apparently
autosomal traits, as has been suggested for schizophrenia (Crow, 1988),
cerebral dominance (Crow, 1989), and Kabuki make-up syndrome (Niikawa et
al., 1988; 147920), among others.

Rappold (1993) discussed in detail the pseudoautosomal regions that
exist at the tips of the short and long arms of the X and Y chromosomes
and cover 2.6 and 0.4 Mb, respectively.

By both in situ hybridization and linkage analysis, Disteche et al.
(1992) found that the murine Csf2ra gene maps to chromosome 19.

GENE FUNCTION

DiPersio et al. (1988) studied the binding of GMCSF, over a wide range
of concentrations, to normal human peripheral blood cells, bone marrow,
acute and chronic myeloid leukemia cells, and a number of established
human myeloid and nonmyeloid cell lines; thereby, they defined the
receptors.

Gearing et al. (1989) found that transfection of GMCSFR cDNA into COS
cells directed expression of a GMCSF receptor showing a single class of
affinity and specificity for human GMCSF, but not interleukin-3 (IL3;
147740).

Hayashida et al. (1990) showed that the high-affinity GMCSF receptor is
composed of at least 2 components in a manner analogous to the IL2
receptor (see 147730). They proposed to designate the low-affinity GMCSF
receptor as the alpha subunit, and the 'new' protein that they
identified and called KH97 as the beta subunit (see 138981). The 2
subunits are approximately 80 and 120 kD, respectively.

Raines et al. (1991) found that expression of the variant cDNA encoding
the truncated, soluble CSF2R isoform produced a secreted protein that
retained its capacity to bind CSF2 in solution.

Kondo et al. (2000) showed that a clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor,
a bone marrow-resident cell that gives rise exclusively to lymphocytes
(T, B, and natural killer cells), can be redirected to the myeloid
lineage by stimulation through exogenously expressed interleukin-2
receptor (146710) and GMCSF receptor. Analysis of mutants of the
beta-chain of the IL2 receptor revealed that the granulocyte and
monocyte differentiation signals are triggered by different cytoplasmic
domains, showing that the signaling pathways responsible for these
unique developmental outcomes are separable. Finally, Kondo et al.
(2000) showed that the endogenous myelomonocytic cytokine receptors for
GMCSF and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1R; 164770) are
expressed at low to moderate levels on the more primitive hematopoietic
stem cells, are absent on common lymphoid progenitors, and are
upregulated after myeloid lineage induction by IL2 (147680). Kondo et
al. (2000) concluded that cytokine signaling can regulate cell fate
decisions and proposed that a critical step in lymphoid commitment is
downregulation of cytokine receptors that drive myeloid cell
development.

Loss of either the X or the Y chromosome is apparent in 25% of acute
myeloid leukemias of the M2 subtype (AML-M2), compared with only 1 to 6%
in other AML subtypes, suggesting the involvement of a 'recessive
oncogene' in the genesis of M2 AMLs. The presumed gene is likely to be
in the PAR, because if it were located in the portion of the X
chromosome not shared with the Y, then similar loss of the Y chromosome
would not be predicted, and vice versa. Gough et al. (1990) suggested
that CSF2R may be the gene in question. Loss or inactivation of both
copies of the gene in a myeloid progenitor cell would be expected to
result in a clone of cells unable to respond to GMCSF, and hence in the
relatively undifferentiated phenotype of the M2 form of leukemia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder in which
surfactant-derived lipoproteins accumulate excessively within pulmonary
alveoli, causing severe respiratory distress. It is a disorder of
surfactant metabolism. The importance of CSF2 in the pathogenesis of PAP
has been confirmed in humans and mice, wherein CSF2 signaling is
required for pulmonary alveolar macrophage catabolism of surfactant.
Using flow cytometry, Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) found that
CSF2RA was absent on monocytes from a 4-year-old girl with PAP due to
pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction (SMDP4; 300770). The
patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas the
patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation of
monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 induced upregulation of
CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the patient. Karyotypic
analysis showed that the patient had 1 X chromosome of apparently normal
length and 1 X chromosome with a truncated Xp arm that did not hybridize
with a PAR1 probe. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in
leukocytes from the patient's family members, but not in those from the
patient. PCR analysis of the 11 coding exons of the CSF2RA gene revealed
a deletion of exons 5 through 13 (306250.0001) in the patient's DNA,
providing a genetic basis for the absence of CSF2RA mRNA and protein.

Using flow cytometry, Suzuki et al. (2008) found that both CSF2RA and
CSF2RB were present on leukocytes from 2 sisters with PAP, as well as
all family members tested. However, Western blot analysis showed that
the affected sisters expressed only a truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas
their father was heterozygous for the normal and truncated forms, and
their mother expressed only normal CSF2RA. CSF2 binding and
CSF2-dependent signaling were severely reduced, but not abolished, in
the sisters, and their CD11B stimulation test was abnormal. Suzuki et
al. (2008) identified a mutation in the CSF2RA gene in the affected
sisters that resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R; 306250.0002)
substitution. The father was heterozygous for the G174R mutation, but
the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed that CSF2RA
copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but not in the
father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of PAR1, including
the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome of the sisters and mother. Suzuki et
al. (2008) concluded that PAP may be caused by compound heterozygous
abnormalities affecting the CSF2RA gene, and that CSF2 signaling is
critical for surfactant homeostasis in humans.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schweizerhof et al. (2009) presented evidence that GCSF (CSF3; 138970)
and GMCSF mediate bone cancer pain and tumor-nerve interactions.
Increased levels of both factors were detected in bone marrow lysates
and adjoining connective tissue in a mouse sarcoma model of bone
tumor-induced pain compared to controls. The functional receptors GCSFR
(CSF3R; 138971) and GMCSFR were expressed on peripheral nerves in the
bone matrix and in dorsal root ganglia. GMCSF sensitized nerves to
mechanical stimuli in vitro and in vivo, potentiated CGRP (114130)
release, and caused sprouting of sensory nerve endings in the skin. RNA
interference of GCSF and GMCSF signaling in the mouse sarcoma model led
to reduced tumor growth and nerve remodeling, and abrogated bone cancer
pain.

In a 4-year-old girl with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (300770),
Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) identified a deletion of exons 5
through 13 in the CSF2RA gene. Karyotypic analysis showed that the
patient's other X chromosome had a truncated Xp arm that did not
hybridize with a probe for pseudoautosomal region-1, which contains
CSF2RA. The patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas
the patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation
of monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 (1389060) induced
upregulation of CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the
patient. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in leukocytes
from the patient's family members, but not in those from the patient.

CSF2RA, GLY174ARG

Suzuki et al. (2008) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the
CSF2RA gene in genomic DNA from 2 sisters with pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis (300770), one 6 years of age and the other 8 years of age.
The mutation resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R) substitution that
altered 1 of 11 potential N-glycosylation sites in the CSF2RA protein.
Western blot analysis showed that the affected sisters expressed only a
truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas their father was heterozygous for the
normal and truncated forms, and their mother expressed only normal
CSF2RA. CSF2 (138960) binding and CSF2-dependent signaling were severely
reduced, but not abolished, in the sisters, and their CD11B (120980)
stimulation test was abnormal. The father was heterozygous for the G174R
mutation, but the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed
that CSF2RA copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but
not in the father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of
pseudoautosomal region-1, including the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome
of the sisters and mother. Transfection of CSF2RA with the G174R
mutation into 293 cells reproduced the CSF2 signaling defect at
physiologic CSF2 concentrations. At high CSF2 concentrations, similar to
those observed in the index patient, signaling was partially rescued,
thereby providing a molecular explanation for the slow disease
progression in the 2 sisters.

608058	TITLE *608058 GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATASE, CATALYTIC, 2; G6PC2
;;ISLET-SPECIFIC GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATASE CATALYTIC SUBUNIT-RELATED PROTEIN;
IGRP;;
ISLET-SPECIFIC G6CP-RELATED PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Arden et al. (1999) cloned 2 splice variants of mouse Igrp. The longer
cDNA, which includes exon 4, encodes a 355-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of about 40.7 kD. This variant shares about
50% amino acid identity with the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit
(G6PC; 613742) from several species, including human, and has a similar
transmembrane topology, conservation of catalytically important
residues, and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal. The
shorter transcript, which lacks exon 4, encodes 2 putative proteins,
neither of which are likely to be catalytically active. Northern blot
analysis detected expression in mouse pancreatic islets, and expression
was higher in pancreatic beta-cell lines than in pancreatic alpha-cell
lines. No expression was detected in non-islet neuroendocrine tissue or
in any other tissue tested.

By RT-PCR of cadaveric pancreatic islet total RNA, Martin et al. (2001)
cloned IGRP. The deduced 355-amino acid protein contains 9 major
hydrophobic stretches, 8 of which may span the membrane as an alpha
helix, and a C-terminal ER membrane retention motif. It also has 3
potential N-glycosylation sites, 1 of which, located in the putative
second luminal domain, is conserved with mouse Igrp. Human and mouse
IGRP share about 85% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis
detected a 3.1-kb transcript in pancreas and weaker expression of 2.4-
and 1.0-kb transcripts in testis. Northern blot analysis detected Igrp
expression in mouse islets, but not in rat islets. RT-PCR analysis of
human islets and beta cell-derived cell lines revealed several splice
variants, the most prominent of which had a deletion of exon 4. Western
blot analysis of human islets showed a protein of about 38 kD. In vitro
translation from 2 alternate start codons, which predict proteins of
40.6 and 33.8 kD, resulted in proteins with apparent molecular masses of
about 37 and 28 kD, respectively.

IGRP was identified as the antigen that serves as the major target of
cell-mediated autoimmunity in diabetes by DiLorenzo et al. (1998). The
IGRP protein was first identified from a subtractive hybridization
screen that was performed to identify beta cell-specific proteins that
could be potential diabetes autoantigens or regulators of insulin
stimulus-secretion coupling (Neophytou et al., 1996). IGRP was initially
investigated as a possible islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)
that had long been postulated as a key component of a glucose substrate
cycle and control of energy metabolism in the beta cell (Arden et al.,
1999).

GENE FUNCTION

IGRP has 50% sequence identity with liver G6Pase (G6PC; 613742), spans
the membrane in the same way, and has the conserved acid phosphatase
signature but no discernable catalytic activity (Ebert et al., 1999).
Similar to insulin and islet amyloid polypeptide (147940), it is
expressed in a highly pancreatic beta-cell manner, yet seems to be
controlled by a different set of transcription factors. IGRP and mRNA
are abundant in mouse and human islets but are not expressed in the rat,
where the single-copy gene has an altered transcriptional start site and
a series of frameshift mutations and deletions relative to the human and
mouse genes (Martin et al., 2001).

GENE STRUCTURE

Martin et al. (2001) determined that the human, mouse, and rat IGRP
genes contain 5 exons. The promoter regions from all 3 species contain
an HNF3 (see 602294)-binding site and 2 E boxes. The human and mouse
genes, but not the rat gene, also have a TATA box.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Martin et
al. (2001) mapped the IGRP gene to chromosome 2q28-q32; however, as
there is no band 2q28, the presumed location is 2q24-q32. It is located
adjacent to the myosin heavy chain 1B gene.

Pociot and McDermott (2002) noted that the human IGRP gene maps to a
diabetes susceptibility locus on 2q31 (IDDM7; 600321). Hutton and
Eisenbarth (2003) noted that the IGRP gene resides a short distance from
GAD1 (605363) and Bardet-Biedl syndrome 5 (603650) at 2q31; from the
NEUROD1 gene (601724), which is involved in NIDDM (125853) at 2q32; and
from CTLA4 (123890), which is a candidate gene for IDDM12 (601388) at
2q33. Glucagon (138030) also maps nearby (2q32-q37).

Using interspecific backcross analysis, Ebert et al. (1999) mapped the
mouse Igrp gene to the proximal portion of chromosome 2.

ANIMAL MODEL

The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a widely studied model of human
type I diabetes (IDDM; 222100), an autoimmune disease characterized by
inflammation of pancreatic islets (insulitis) followed by T
cell-mediated destruction of insulin (176730)-producing beta cells. Both
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are required for this pathogenic process; however,
CD8+ T cells appear to be responsible for the initial beta cell insult.
Lieberman et al. (2003) demonstrated that the autoantigen targeted by a
prevalent population of pathogenic CD8+ T cells in NOD mice is IGRP.
Using tetramer technology, IGRP-reactive T cells were readily detected
in islets and peripheral blood directly ex vivo.

609590	TITLE *609590 QUAKING, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; QKI
;;QK1;;
QK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

QKI belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins that have an HNRNPK
(600712) homology (KH) domain embedded in a 200-amino acid region called
the GSG domain. Other members of this family include SAM68 (KHDRBS1;
602489) and SF1 (601516) (Chen and Richard, 1998). QKI proteins regulate
RNA splicing, export of target RNAs from the nucleus, translation of
proteins, and RNA stability (Lauriat et al., 2008).

CLONING

Ebersole et al. (1996) identified several splice variants of mouse Qki
that could be grouped into 2 classes based on size. The longer mRNAs (7,
6, and 5 kb) were abundant in mouse brain, whereas the shorter mRNAs
(1.5 to 1.9 kb) were less abundant. The longer variants encode deduced
proteins containing an N-terminal proline-rich domain, followed by 2 RG
boxes, a second proline-rich region, a central GSG/STAR domain, a third
proline-rich domain, and 5 tyrosines preceding alternative C-terminal
ends. The GSG domain consists of a KH domain flanked by evolutionarily
conserved quaking (QUA) domains 1 and 2. Qki also has 7 SH3-binding
sites dispersed throughout its sequence. Qki expression peaked in
16-day-old myelinating mouse brain. A splice variant was also detected
in newborn testis. In situ hybridization of normal mouse brain showed
Qki transcripts in myelinating tracts in the cerebellum. Ebersole et al.
(1996) identified multiple QKI transcripts in human, rodent, chicken,
and frog.

By Northern blot analysis, Hardy et al. (1996) found that the 5-, 6-,
and 7-kb Qki mRNAs, which they designated Qki-5, Qki-6, and Qki-7,
respectively, were variably expressed in developing and adult mouse
brain. Levels of Qki-5 declined dramatically after the second postnatal
week, whereas levels of Qki-6 and Qki-7 declined modestly thereafter.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected all 3 proteins in myelinating
cells of the central and peripheral nervous system and in astrocytes.
The isoforms showed distinct intracellular distributions, however, with
Qki-6 and Qki-7 localized to perikaryal cytoplasm and Qki-5 restricted
to nucleus.

Noveroske et al. (2002) found that Qki was expressed in the yolk sac
endoderm in mice, adjacent to developing blood islands.

Using quantitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) found that QKI-5 showed
no significant differences in expression across various age groups in
human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. However, QKI-5 was the
only QKI variant expressed at high levels in fetal PFC. QKI-6 expression
increased in PFC in a linear fashion with age, with a substantial
increase between 1 to 2 months and 1 to 2 years of age. In human
hippocampus, QKI-6 expression increased at 1 to 2 years of age, remained
high during childhood, and decreased in adulthood. QKI-7a generally
showed a linear trend toward increased expression in PFC with age, but
there was a peak at 1 to 2 years of age. QKI-7b expression in PFC did
not vary significantly with age due to greater variability between
individuals, but there was a trend toward an increase with age. In
hippocampus, QKI-7a and QKI-7b showed a trend toward decreased
expression in adulthood, similar to QKI-6, but there was greater
variability between individuals. Lauriat et al. (2008) noted that
expression of QKI-6 and QKI-7 in PFC increased during the period of
active myelination.

By sequencing mRNAs expressed in primary cultures of human astrocytes,
Radomska et al. (2013) identified QKI5, QKI6, QKI7, QKI7b, and a novel
variant that they called QKI6b. QKI6b differs from other QKI variants in
the 3-prime UTR and encodes a protein identical to that encoded by QKI6.
QKI6 and QKI6b were the most abundant QKI transcripts detected in human
astrocytes, and QKI5 was the least abundant. Immunohistochemical
analysis with isoform-specific antibodies revealed that QKI6 and QKI7
were uniformly distributed throughout the nucleus, cell body, and
processes, whereas QKI5 localized to nuclei and was excluded from
nucleoli. Western blot analysis detected QKI6 at an apparent molecular
mass of 38 kD. Both QKI5 and QKI7 had apparent molecular masses of about
40 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Backx et al. (2010) noted that the QKI gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Backx et al. (2010) stated that the QKI gene maps to chromosome 6q26.

The mouse Qki gene maps to chromosome 17 (Ebersole et al., 1996).

GENE FUNCTION

Chen and Richard (1998) showed that the mouse Qk1 proteins homodimerized
in vivo, and they determined that the GSG domain mediated dimerization
and RNA binding. Self-association was mediated by a region of QUA1
predicted to form coiled coils.

Larocque et al. (2002) found that mouse Qk1 proteins bound a short
element in the 3-prime UTR of Mbp (159430). The balance between the
nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms of Qk1 controlled the nuclear export of
Mbp mRNAs and the cellular localization of the 17- and 21.5-kD Mbp
isoforms. Overexpression of Qki-5 in cultured rodent oligodendrocytes
recreated the Mbp defects observed in qk(v) mice, with retention of Mbp
in the nucleus. Larocque et al. (2002) concluded that the QKI proteins
have a role in myelination.

In an mRNA analysis of 55 control human brains, Aberg et al. (2006)
found that QKI mRNA levels accounted for 47% of the coordinated
variation of mRNA levels of 6 oligodendrocyte-related genes, PLP1
(300401), MAG (159460), MBP, TF (190000), SOX10 (602229), and CDKN1B
(600778). In silico analysis identified potential QKI-binding sites in
all of the genes except TF. Variation in the relative expression of
splice variant QKI-7 explained a large fraction of additional mRNA
variation in 3 highly coexpressed genes, MAG, PLP1, and TF. Analysis of
55 brains from patients with schizophrenia (see 181500) showed
significantly decreased expression of MAG, PLP1, and TF compared to
control brains that was associated with decreased levels of QKI-7. Aberg
et al. (2006) concluded that QKI is a regulator of oligodendrocyte
differentiation and maturation in the human brain, and suggested that
splice variants of QKI may play a role in myelin and oligodendrocyte
dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Using yeast 2-hybrid screens, coaffinity purification analysis of
transfected HEK293 cells, and bioinformatic analysis, Lim et al. (2006)
developed an interaction network for 54 human proteins involved in 23
inherited ataxias. By database analysis, they expanded the core network
to include more distantly related interacting proteins that could
function as genetic modifiers. RBPMS (601558) was a main hub in the
network and interacted with many proteins, including the cerebellar
ataxia-associated proteins ATN1 (607462) and QK1.

Using a rat cell line and primary mixed glial cultures from neonatal rat
brain, Chen et al. (2007) showed that Qk1 was necessary and sufficient
for oligodendroglia progenitor cell differentiation. Qk1 isoforms 5, 6,
and 7 differed in their ability to promote oligodendroglia
differentiation, which was dependent on the RNA-binding ability of Qk1.
RNA interference-mediated Qk1 knockdown abrogated differentiation
without affecting proliferation capacity or cell cycle progression.

Using qualitative RT-PCR, Lauriat et al. (2008) examined expression of
putative QKI target mRNAs, including MAGI1 (602625), BCAS1 (602968),
CDKN1B, PLP1, and MAG, in human prefrontal cortex and hippocampus from
fetus to adulthood (up to 46 years of age). Most of the putative QKI
target mRNAs showed increased expression with increasing age in
prefrontal cortex. However, there was little evidence of developmental
regulation of these mRNAs in hippocampus.

Using small interfering RNA, Radomska et al. (2013) found that knockdown
of QKI7 in cultured human astrocytes reduced expression of an astrocyte
differentiation marker, GFAP (137780), but did not reduce cell
viability. The dominant GFAP variant expressed in the astrocytes,
GFAP-alpha, was the most highly downregulated. Radomska et al. (2013)
identified a core QKI regulatory element (QRE) in the 3-prime UTR of the
GFAP-alpha transcript and a potential upstream half-site. The QRE, but
not the half-site, was conserved in mouse Gfap. Exposure of astrocytes
to the antipsychotic drug haloperidol specifically increased expression
of QKI7 and GFAP transcripts.

CYTOGENETICS

Backx et al. (2010) reported a woman with borderline mental retardation
and dysmorphic features who had a de novo reciprocal balanced
translocation t(5;6)(q23.1;q26) disrupting the QKI gene. The 5q
breakpoint occurred in a gene desert. RNA studies showed a 50% reduction
in QKI expression, consistent with haploinsufficiency. She presented at
birth with hypotonia, short neck, genital hypoplasia with underdeveloped
labia majora, and facial dysmorphism including epicanthal folds, narrow
palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge with small nose and bulbous tip,
small mouth with downturned corners, a long philtrum, and small
protruding cupped ears. She attended special education schools.
Evaluation at age 23 years showed relative microcephaly,
microretrognathia, small mouth with high-arched palate, myopia, and
nasal speech. She also had inverted nipples and irregular menses.
Seizures and brain anomalies were not present.

Backx et al. (2010) provided a literature review of 18 patients reported
with chromosome 6qter deletions and 2 patients reported with
interstitial 6q deletion. All deletions included the QKI gene. They
noted that while the deletion sizes varied a common recognizable
phenotype of intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, seizures, brain
anomalies, and specific dysmorphic facial features could be distilled
for the chromosome 6qter deletion syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Recessive mutations in the mouse quaking gene affect myelination and
embryogenesis and can be embryonic lethal. A spontaneous, recessive
quaking mutation, qk(v), results in viable mice with a severe deficit in
myelin, leading to rapid tremor by postnatal day 10. By Northern blot
analysis, Ebersole et al. (1996) detected a truncated Qki message in
brains of qk(v) mice.

Hardy et al. (1996) found that Qki-6 and Qki-7 were absent from
myelin-forming cells in qk(v) mice. Qki-5 was absent only from
oligodendrocytes of tracts from severely affected qk(v) brain regions.

Wu et al. (2002) found misregulated alternative splicing of several
myelin genes in qk(v) mice.

Lu et al. (2003) presented evidence that the qk(v) mutation affects an
enhancer required for expression of Qki in myelinating cells but not in
other tissues.

Chen and Richard (1998) determined that a point mutation within the QUA1
region of Qk1 caused embryonic lethality in mice. The mutation abolished
Qk1 self-association but had no effect on RNA-binding activity.
Expression of wildtype Qk1 or a lethal mutant Qk1 deficient in
self-association but not RNA binding induced cell death by apoptosis in
a mouse fibroblast cell line. The lethal Qk1 mutant was more potent at
inducing apoptosis.

Noveroske et al. (2002) found that embryonic mice with a lethal point
mutation in Qki had defective yolk sac vascular remodeling and abnormal
vessels in the embryo proper at midgestation, coinciding with embryonic
death.

Noveroske et al. (2005) isolated qk(e5), an N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea-induced
viable allele of mouse Qki. Unlike qk(v)/qk(v) mice, qk(e5)/qk(e5) mice
had early-onset seizures, severe ataxia, and a dramatically reduced life
span. Ultrastructural analysis of qk(e5)/qk(e5) brains revealed severe
dysmyelination when compared with both wildtype and qk(v)/qk(v) brains.
Young adult qk(e5)/qk(e5) mice exhibited Purkinje cell axonal swellings
indicative of neurodegeneration, which is not seen in young adult
qk(v)/qk(v) mice. The molecular defect in the qk(e5) allele was not
evident, but protein expression studies showed that qk(e5)/qk(e5)
postnatal oligodendrocytes lacked Qki-6 and Qki-7 and had reduced Qki-5
levels. Several oligodendrocyte developmental markers were present in
qk(e5)/qk(e5) postnatal brain, but Cnp (123830) and Mbp levels were
considerably reduced. Noveroske et al. (2005) noted that qk(v) is a
large deletion that affects expression of Pacrg (608427) and Parkin
(PARK2; 602544) in addition to Qki, complicating interpretation of its
neuropathology. Thus, they suggested that qk(e5) may be useful in
studying QKI regulation in the developing central nervous system and its
role in myelination.

Wilson et al. (2010) noted that the qk(v) phenotype, which includes
dysmyelination of the central nervous system and male sterility, is due
to reduced expression of Qk and a complete lack of Pacrg expression,
respectively. Since Pacrg is required for correct development of the
spermatozoan flagella (a specialized type of motile cilia), Wilson et
al. (2010) analyzed qk(v) mutant mice for evidence of cilial
dysfunction. Histologic and magnetic resonance imaging analyses
demonstrated that qk(v) mutant mice were affected by acquired,
communicating hydrocephalus (HC). Structure of axonemal microtubules and
density of ciliated cells were normal, and cilia length was similar to
wildtype littermates. There was a reduction in ependymal cilial beat
frequency and cilial-mediated flow in qk(v) mutant mice compared with
wildtype littermate controls. Transgenic expression of Pacrg was
necessary and sufficient to correct this deficit and rescue the HC
phenotype in the qk(v) mutant. Wilson et al. (2010) concluded that Pacrg
is required for motile cilia function and may be involved in the
pathogenesis of human ciliopathies, such as HC, asthenospermia, and
primary ciliary dyskinesia.

300144	TITLE *300144 GLUTAMATE DEHYDROGENASE 2; GLUD2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) catalyzes the reversible oxidative
deamination of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate using NAD and/or NADP as
cofactors. See also GLUD1 (138130).

CLONING

Since blindness due to neuroretinal degeneration occurs in some types of
multiple system atrophy, Shashidharan et al. (1994) searched for
retinal-specific GLUD mRNA(s) by screening a retinal cDNA library. A
novel cDNA encoded by an X-linked intronless gene was cloned. Reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of human tissues
demonstrated that the novel cDNA is expressed in human retina, testis,
and, at a lower level, brain. In vitro translation of mRNAs derived from
GLUD1 and the new gene, called GLUD2, generated proteins with distinct
electrophoretic characteristics. The retinal cDNA was expressed in the
baculovirus heterologous system, producing a protein capable of
catalyzing the oxidative deamination of glutamate. Expression of the
GLUD2 gene in human retina was of particular interest in view of the
finding that glutamate is an important retinal excitatory transmitter.

GENE FUNCTION

Partial deficiency of glutamate dehydrogenase has been found in patients
with various neurodegenerative disorders and a deficiency has been
thought to cause neuroexcitotoxic nerve cell death (Plaitakis et al.,
1982, 1984). The brains of these patients show loss of glutamate
receptors and a selective atrophy of regions that receive glutamatergic
terminals and are normally rich in glutamate dehydrogenase
immunoreactivity. In these regions, the enzyme is localized in
astrocytic processes associated with glutamatergic terminals and is
thought to be involved in the detoxification of transmitter glutamate.
Given the extensive nature of the glutamatergic pathways in the brain,
glutamate dehydrogenase might play a role in a number of human
neurodegenerations.

GENE STRUCTURE

The GLUD2 gene consists of 11 exons (Wan and Francke, 1998).

MAPPING

Shashidharan et al. (1994) mapped the GLUD2 gene to the X chromosome by
PCR amplification of DNA derived from hamster/human hybrid lines that
contained human chromosome 10 or X. Southern blot analysis of the
amplified products, using oligonucleotide probes capable of
discriminating between the GLUD1 and GLUD2 genes, revealed that the
GLUD2 gene is linked to the human X chromosome, whereas the GLUD1 gene
is linked to the human chromosome 10. Also, Southern blot analysis of
genomic DNA from males and females showed that females possess a double
dose of the GLUD2 gene.

Jung et al. (1989) and Anagnou et al. (1993) mapped the GLUD2 gene to
Xq. Online information in the dbSTS database was cited by Wan and
Francke (1998) as indicating that the GLUD2 gene is located at Xq25.
Francke (1998) stated that the GLUD2 gene was indirectly mapped to Xq25
by sequence identity to a radiation hybrid mapped STS.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wan and Francke (1998) examined the GLUD2 gene as the possible site of
mutations causing Rett syndrome (RTT; 312750), an X-linked dominant
neurodevelopmental disorder lethal in hemizygous males. The intronless
gene GLUD2 is involved in the metabolism of glutamate, a
neurotransmitter reported to be elevated in the spinal fluid of RTT
individuals. No mutations in the GLUD2 gene were found in 22 RTT
patients.

Plaitakis et al. (2010) identified a 1492T-G polymorphism in the GLUD2
gene, resulting in a ser445-to-ala (S445A; 300144.0001) substitution,
that was associated with earlier age of onset in 2 cohorts of patients
with Parkinson disease (PD; 168600). Among 584 Greek patients, 1492G
hemizygous males developed PD 8 to 13 years earlier than did patients
with the T (p = 0.003), the G/T (p less than 0.001), or the T/T (p =
0.01) genotype. Among 224 North American patients, 1492G hemizygotes
also developed PD earlier than those with other genotypes, but the mean
age differences reached statistical significance only when G hemizygotes
were compared to G/T heterozygotes (mean age difference: 13.1 years, p
less than 0.05). The substitution was demonstrated to confer a gain of
function, which Plaitakis et al. (2010) postulated may increase
glutamate oxidation and the production of reactive oxygen species in the
brain.

EVOLUTION

Shashidharan et al. (1994) noted that several other functionless
intronless genes generated by reverse transcription and insertion into
the human genome as retroposons have been identified. Some of these are
expressed in neural tissues, encoding for G protein-linked receptors, or
in testis, encoding for the metabolic enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase and
phosphoglycerate kinase. In contrast, the GLUD2 intronless gene is
expressed in both neural and testicular tissues. The localization of the
GLUD2 gene to the X chromosome and of GLUD1 to chromosome 10 represents
a reversal of the chromosomal loci of the 2 forms of pyruvate
dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase; the intronless genes of
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA2; 179061) and phosphoglycerate kinase
(PGK2; 172270) map to autosomal chromosomes, while their
intron-containing genes (PDHA1, 300502; PGK1, 311800) map to the X
chromosome. Retroposition of the latter 2 genes to autosomal chromosomes
may have occurred in order to serve the metabolic needs of sperm cells,
only half of which contain an X chromosome.

The enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase is important for recycling the chief
excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, during neurotransmission. It
exists in housekeeping and brain-specific isotypes encoded by GLUD1
(138130) and GLUD2, respectively. Burki and Kaessmann (2004) showed that
GLUD2 originated by retroposition from GLUD1 in the hominoid ancestor
less than 23 million years ago. The amino acid changes responsible for
the unique brain-specific properties of the enzyme derived from GLUD2
occurred during a period of positive selection after the duplication
event. The genes ASPM (605481) and MCPH1 (607117), determinants of brain
size, also showed accelerated evolution during that time. Thus higher
neuronal activity may have coevolved with greater brain size and other
changes. GLUD2 probably contributed to enhanced brain function in humans
and apes by permitting higher neurotransmitter flux. In a commentary on
the work of Burki and Kaessmann (2004), Varki (2004) discussed the
apparent role of the retrotransposed gene duplicate GLUD2, which
acquired brain-specific expression and functions affecting the
neurotransmitter glutamate.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PARKINSON DISEASE, AGE OF ONSET, MODIFIER
GLUD2, SER445ALA

Plaitakis et al. (2010) identified a 1492T-G polymorphism in the GLUD2
gene, resulting in a ser445-to-ala (S445A) substitution in the
regulatory domain, that was associated with earlier age of onset in 2
cohorts of patients with Parkinson disease (PD; 168600). Among 584 Greek
patients, 1492G hemizygous males developed PD 8 to 13 years earlier than
did patients with the T (p = 0.003), the G/T (p less than 0.001), or the
T/T (p = 0.01) genotype. Among 224 North American patients, 1492G
hemizygotes also developed PD earlier than those with other genotypes,
but the mean age differences reached statistical significance only when
G hemizygotes were compared to G/T heterozygotes (mean age difference:
13.1 years, p less than 0.05). Gender did not affect the age at
development of PD. The frequency of the G allele was rare (3.6% in the
Greek and 4.3% in the American populations). In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the variant ala445 enzyme had increased
basal activity and thermal stability compared to wildtype. The variant
protein showed resistance to suppression by GTP, but was sensitive to
inhibition by estrogen. The findings suggested an overall gain of
function and explained the lack of effect in female heterozygous PD
patients. Plaitakis et al. (2010) postulated that increased glutamate
oxidation in the brain may increase reactive oxygen species, which would
accelerate a degenerative process.

ALG2-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; AIP1;;

KIAA1375
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PDCD6IP interacts with proteins associated with apoptosis, including
PDCD6 (601057), and with endophilins, which regulate membrane shape
(Chatellard-Causse et al., 2002).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned PDCD6IP, which they designated
KIAA1375. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in all adult and
fetal tissues tested except adult lung, spleen, and pancreas and fetal
brain, which all showed low expression. Moderate expression was detected
in all individual brain regions examined.

Wu et al. (2001) cloned full-length PDCD6IP, which they designated p95,
by searching databases for sequences similar to YNK1, the C. elegans
PDCD6IP homolog, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a placenta cDNA
library. The deduced 868-amino acid PDCD6IP protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 96 kD. It has a proline-rich C terminus containing
several PxxP motifs, which are SRC (190090) homology domain-3
(SH3)-binding domains. PDCD6IP also contains a tyrosine
autophosphorylation consensus sequence that is conserved with SRC family
members, as well as several additional conserved tyrosines. PDCD6IP
shares significant homology with proteins from mouse, Xenopus,
Drosophila, several yeast species, and Arabidopsis. Northern blot
analysis detected an endogenous 3.5-kb transcript in HeLa cell RNA.
Western blot analysis of HeLa cell lysates determined that the PDCD6IP
protein has an apparent molecular mass of 95 kD.

Missotten et al. (1999) cloned mouse Pdcd6ip, which they called Alix, in
a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library using Alg2 (PDCD6) as
bait. The deduced 869-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass
of about 96 kD. The authors noted that, in addition to several
SH3-binding domains, the C terminus of Alix contains a WW-binding
domain. Northern blot analysis detected 3.5- and 6.5-kb transcripts in
all adult mouse tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Normal epithelial cells stop proliferating in culture following
cell-cell contact due to induction of G1 phase arrest in the cell cycle.
However, malignant HeLa cells do not inhibit proliferation upon
cell-cell contact and proceed toward multilayer growth. Wu et al. (2001)
determined that overexpression of PDCD6IP restored the ability of HeLa
cells to undergo G1 phase arrest and form a monolayer culture after
confluence. Overexpression of PDCD6IP did not inhibit HeLa cell growth
in sparse cultures.

Wu et al. (2002) found that overexpression of PDCD6IP in HeLa cells
promoted detachment-induced apoptosis, inhibited detachment of viable
cells from the substratum, and reduced tumorigenicity following
injection into nude mice. Overexpression in mouse fibroblasts promoted
flat cell morphology and slowed cell proliferation. Transfection of
antisense PDCD6IP had the opposite effects, with more rounded fibroblast
morphology and dense growth.

Missotten et al. (1999) determined that interaction between mouse Alix
and Alg2 is calcium-dependent.

Vito et al. (1999) determined that mouse Alix and Alg2 colocalized in
the cytosol of fibroblasts and required calcium for their association.
Overexpression of the C terminus of Alix protected HeLa and COS cells
from apoptosis induced by withdrawal of trophic factors.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Chatellard-Causse et al. (2002) determined
that mouse Alix binds to the endophilins Sh3p4 (604465), Sh3p8 (601768),
and Sh3p13 (603362). Coimmunoprecipitation and overlay experiments with
truncation mutants demonstrated that the SH3 domains of endophilins bind
to the C terminus of Alix, specifically within a 14-amino acid region
containing a PxRPPPP consensus sequence. Upon overexpression in human
embryonic kidney cells, full-length Alix and the N terminus of Alix
concentrated in the perinuclear region and at the cell periphery in
lamellipodia and filopodia. Overexpression of the C terminus of Alix in
several cell lines led to concentration around perinuclear vesicles and
to cytoplasmic vacuolization into tubulovesicular structures.
Immunolocalization revealed that the structures were lined by Alix and
endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. Vacuolization was enhanced upon
coexpression of with Sh3p4, and Alix lacking the proline-rich domain did
not cause vacuolization when overexpressed alone or with Sh3p4.

Matsuo et al. (2004) found that the unconventional phospholipid
lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) could induce the formation of
multivesicular liposomes that resembled the multivesicular endosomes
that exist where this lipid is found in vivo. This process depended on
the same pH gradient that exists across endosome membranes in vivo and
was selectively controlled by Alix. In turn, Alix regulated the
organization of LBPA-containing endosomes in vivo.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation analysis, and in vitro
protein pull-down assays, Katoh et al. (2003) showed that CHMP4B
(610897) interacted with ALIX. Overexpression of CHMP4B in HeLa cells
caused redistribution of ALIX from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear
area, where the 2 proteins colocalized. Transient overexpression of the
ALIX N-terminal region in HEK293 cells stably expressing CHMP4B induced
formation of vesicle-like structures in which CHMP4B and truncated ALIX
colocalized. A dominant-negative form of the AAA-type ATPase SKD1
(VPS4B; 609983), which plays critical roles in the endocytic pathway,
coimmunoprecipitated with CHMP4B. Furthermore, both CHMP4B and ALIX
colocalized with dominant-negative SKD1 in perinuclear dot-like
distributions in transfected HeLa cells, suggesting that the 3 proteins
are involved in formation of multivesicular bodies.

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis and in vitro pull-down assays,
Katoh et al. (2004) showed that ALIX interacted with all 3 CHMP4
proteins, although the interaction was stronger between ALIX and CHMP4B
than between ALIX and CHMP4A (610051) or CHMP4C (610899).

Carlton and Martin-Serrano (2007) found that 2 proteins involved in
HIV-1 budding--tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101; 601387), a subunit
of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport 1 (ESCRT-1), and
ALIX, an ESCRT-associated protein--were recruited to the midbody during
cytokinesis by interaction with centrosome protein 55 (CEP55; 610000), a
centrosome and midbody protein essential for abscission. TSG101, ALIX,
and possibly other components of ESCRT-1 were required for the
completion of cytokinesis. Carlton and Martin-Serrano (2007) concluded
that thus, HIV-1 budding and cytokinesis use a similar subset of
cellular components to carry out topologically similar membrane fission
events.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human T-cell cDNA library, followed by
coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses, Chen et al.
(2009) identified ALIX as a binding partner for GAL3 (LGALS3; 153619)
and showed that ALIX translocated to the immunologic synapse in
activated T cells. Chen et al. (2009) concluded that GAL3 is an
inhibitory regulator of T-cell activation and that it functions
intracellularly by promoting T-cell receptor downregulation, possibly
through modulation of ALIX function at the immunologic synapse.

Feng et al. (2013) showed that hepatitis A virus (HAV) released from
cells is cloaked in host-derived membranes, thereby protecting the
virion from antibody-mediated neutralization. The enveloped viruses
(eHAV) resemble exosomes, small vesicles that are important in
intercellular communications. They are fully infectious, sensitive to
extraction with chloroform, and circulate in the blood of infected
humans. Their biogenesis is dependent on host proteins associated with
endosomal-sorting complexes required for transport, namely VPS4B and
ALIX. Feng et al. (2013) concluded that while the hijacking of membranes
by HAV facilitates escape from neutralizing antibodies and probably
promotes virus spread within the liver, anti-capsid antibodies restrict
replication after infection with eHAV, suggesting a possible explanation
for prophylaxis after exposure.

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PDCD6IP
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP sts-R60314).

;;T2R30;;
T2R47
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TAS2R30 belongs to a family of intronless genes that encode highly
related bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs). TAS2Rs are G protein-coupled
receptors, which are characterized by 7 transmembrane domains (summary
by Fischer et al., 2005). For further information on the TAS2R gene
family, see 604791.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fischer et al. (2005) mapped the TAS2R30
gene, which they called T2R47, to a small TAS2R gene cluster on
chromosome 1. However, Hartz (2011) mapped the TAS2R30 gene to
chromosome 12p13.2 based on an alignment of the TAS2R30 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AY724940) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608736	TITLE *608736 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 39 (ZINC TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 14; SLC39A14
;;ZIP14;;
KIAA0062
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Zinc is an essential cofactor for hundreds of enzymes. It is involved in
protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, as well as in
the control of gene transcription, growth, development, and
differentiation. SLC39A14 belongs to a subfamily of proteins that show
structural characteristics of zinc transporters (Taylor and Nicholson,
2003).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated immature myeloid
cell line cDNA library, Nomura et al. (1994) cloned SLC39A14, which they
designated KIAA0062. The deduced 531-amino acid protein contains
possible transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis detected SLC39A14
expression in all tissues and cell lines examined. Highest expression
was in liver, and lowest expression was in spleen, thymus, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By searching databases for sequences similar to a unique motif within
LIV-1 (SLC39A6; 608731), Taylor and Nicholson (2003) identified
SLC39A14, which they designated LZT-Hs4. SLC39A14 contains a long N
terminus, followed by 8 putative transmembrane domains and a short C
terminus. It also has a motif similar to the catalytic zinc-binding site
of matrix metalloproteases. Expression of SLC39A14 in Chinese hamster
ovary cells showed an apparent molecular mass of 53 kD and suggested
SLC39A14 has up to 3 N-linked carbohydrate side chains. Under
nonreducing conditions, SLC39A14 migrated as a trimer, consistent with
the formation of an ion channel. SLC39A14 was expressed on the plasma
membrane, colocalized with F-actin, and concentrated on lamellipodiae in
a manner similar to membrane-type matrix metalloproteases.

GENE FUNCTION

Liuzzi et al. (2005) found that Zip14 was the most upregulated zinc
transporter in response to turpentine-induced inflammation or
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse liver. Il6 (147620) -/- mice exhibited
neither hypozincemia nor Zip14 induction with turpentine-induced
inflammation, and the hypozincemic response was milder in Il6 -/- mice
exposed to LPS than in wildtype mice. Northern blot analysis revealed
liver-specific upregulation of a single Zip14 transcript.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased expression of Zip14 on the
plasma membrane of hepatocytes in response to both LPS and turpentine.
Il6 also produced increased expression of Zip14 in primary hepatocyte
cultures and localization of the Zip14 protein to the plasma membrane.
Transfection of mouse Zip14 cDNA into human embryonic kidney cells
increased zinc uptake. Liuzzi et al. (2005) concluded that ZIP14 is a
zinc importer upregulated by IL6 that plays a major role in the
hypozincemia accompanying the acute-phase response to inflammation and
infection.

Liuzzi et al. (2006) analyzed the capability of mouse Zip14 to mediate
uptake of non-transferrin (190000)-bound iron following expression in
human and insect cells. Zip14 localized to the plasma membrane, and its
overexpression increased uptake of both radiolabeled zinc and iron. Iron
was taken up as Fe(2+), and uptake was inhibited by zinc. Suppression of
endogenous Zip14 in mouse hepatocytes by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
reduced uptake of both iron and zinc. Zip14 siRNA also decreased
metallothionein (see 156350) mRNA levels, suggesting that compensatory
mechanisms were not sufficient to restore intracellular zinc.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human/rodent hybrid panel, Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the
SLC39A14 gene to chromosome 8.

606055	TITLE *606055 PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE TRANSFER PROTEIN; PCTP
;;START DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; STARD2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphatidylcholine (PC) transfer protein (PCTP) is a cytosolic protein
first purified from bovine and rat liver that catalyzes intermembrane
transfer of PC. By searching an EST database for homologs of bovine
Pctp, followed by 5-prime RACE and PCR of a kidney cDNA library, Cohen
et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding human PCTP. The deduced 214-amino
acid human protein is 76% and 80% identical to bovine and rat Pctp,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed wide expression of an
approximately 2.3-kb PCTP transcript in all tissues tested except
thymus. Highest expression was detected in liver, placenta, testis,
kidney, and heart, and lowest levels were found in brain and lung.

Van Helvoort et al. (1999) cloned human and mouse PCTP. They noted that
the sn2 fatty acyl-binding domain is 100% identical in the rodent,
bovine, and human proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using Southern blot analysis, van Helvoort et al. (1999) determined that
PCTP is a single-copy gene. By genomic sequence analysis, Cohen et al.
(1999) showed that the PCTP gene contains 6 exons and spans 13 to 23 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Cohen et al. (1999) mapped the PCTP gene
to 17q21-q22. They localized the mouse gene to the central portion of
chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Van Helvoort et al. (1999) disrupted the Pctp gene in mice. Pctp
knockout mice showed no defects in the secretion of PC into bile or lung
surfactant, and the lipid content and composition of bile and surfactant
was normal. The authors concluded that PCTP does not play a major role
in transporting PC from the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is
synthesized, to the hepatocyte canalicular membrane.

191329	TITLE *191329 UBIQUINOL-CYTOCHROME c REDUCTASE CORE PROTEIN II; UQCRC2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The UQCRC2 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex III (Duncan
et al., 1993). See also UQCRC1 (191328).

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes, Duncan et al. (1993)
assigned the UQCRC2 gene to human chromosome 16p12, thus confirming that
it is encoded by the nuclear rather than the mitochondrial genome. Two
other subunits of mitochondrial complex III (CYC1, 123980; UQPC, 191330)
map to chromosome 8.

GENE FUNCTION

Wisloff et al. (2005) hypothesized that artificial selection of rats
based on low and high intrinsic exercise capacity would yield models
that also contrast for cardiovascular disease risk. After 11
generations, rats with low aerobic capacity scored higher on
cardiovascular risk factors that constitute the metabolic syndrome. The
decrease in aerobic capacity was associated with decreases in the
amounts of transcription factors required for mitochondrial biogenesis
and in the amounts of oxidative enzymes in skeletal muscle. Wisloff et
al. (2005) found that the amount of PPARG (601487), PPARG
coactivator-1-alpha (PPARGC1A; 604517), ubiquinol-cytochrome c
oxidoreductase core 2 subunit (UQCRC2), cytochrome c oxidase subunit I
(MTCO1; 516030), uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2; 601693), and ATP synthase
H(+)-transporting mitochondrial F1 complex (F1-ATP synthase; see 108729)
were markedly reduced in the low capacity runner rats in comparison with
the high capacity runners. The uniform decline in these proteins was
consistent with the hypothesis that reduced aerobic metabolism plays a
causal role in the development of the differences between the low
capacity runner and high capacity runner rats. Wisloff et al. (2005)
concluded that impairment of mitochondrial function may link reduced
fitness to cardiovascular and metabolic disease.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected individuals from a large consanguineous Mexican kindred
with mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type 5 (MC3DN5;
615160), Miyake et al. (2013) identified a homozygous mutation in the
UQCRC2 gene (R183W; 191329.0001). Structural analysis indicated that the
substitution would disrupt the hydrophobic core at the interface of the
UQCRC2-containing complex, resulting in destabilization of complex III.
In vitro studies showed that the mutant protein localized properly to
the mitochondria but had decreased expression compared to wildtype,
suggesting protein instability. Complex III activity in one of the
patient's cells was decreased to 50% of normal, whereas complex I
activity was increased and complex IV activity was normal. The patient's
cells also showed severely decreased levels of complex III assembly and
decreased levels of the supercomplex formed from complexes I, III, and
IV. The patients had neonatal onset of severe metabolic acidosis
associated with hyperammonemia and hypoglycemia. Physical signs included
tachypnea and poor sucking. Two of the patients showed normal growth and
development by early childhood despite multiple episodes of metabolic
decompensation, usually associated with illness. The third patient had a
similar disease course, but showed mild development delay at age 18
months.

UQCRC2, ARG183TRP

In 3 affected individuals from a large consanguineous Mexican kindred
with mitochondrial complex III deficiency, nuclear type 5 (MC3DN5;
615160), Miyake et al. (2013) identified a homozygous 547C-T transition
in the UQCRC2 gene, resulting in an arg183-to-trp (R183W) substitution
at a highly conserved residue. The mutation, which was found by exome
sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, was not present in 80
Mexican or 750 Japanese control alleles. Three unaffected family members
were heterozygous for the mutation. Structural analysis indicated that
the substitution would disrupt the hydrophobic core at the interface of
the UQCRC2-containing complex, resulting in destabilization of complex
III. In vitro studies showed that the mutant protein localized properly
to the mitochondria but had decreased expression compared to wildtype,
suggesting protein instability. Complex III activity in one of the
patient's cells was decreased to 50% of normal, whereas complex I
activity was increased and complex IV activity was normal. Patients
cells also showed severely decreased levels of complex III assembly and

IV.

IKAROS; IK1;;
LYF1
IKAROS/BCL6 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ikaros proteins are lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription
factors that are considered master regulators of lymphocyte
differentiation. Klug et al. (1998) noted that there are at least 8
alternatively spliced transcripts of the Ikaros gene that encode
isoforms with common N-terminal and C-terminal domains. By screening a
Jurkat T-cell cDNA library with a mouse Ikaros cDNA, Molnar et al.
(1996) isolated human Ikaros cDNAs. The deduced human and mouse Ikaros
proteins are 95% identical. RT-PCR of human thymus and peripheral blood
leukocyte mRNAs detected 6 Ikaros splicing variants which were expressed
at similar levels and ratios as the corresponding mouse leukocyte Ikaros
transcripts. The authors found that Ikaros proteins are conserved in
sequence composition and relative expression between human T cells and
mouse thymocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of
7.5- and 4.5-kb Ikaros transcripts in human thymus, spleen, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By PCR using primers based on a conserved nucleotide sequence of various
zinc finger proteins, Nietfeld and Meyerhans (1996) cloned human bone
marrow cDNAs encoding Ikaros, which they designated IK1. The deduced
519-amino acid protein is 93% identical to the mouse Ikaros isoform
1/LyF1 isoform VI and contains 4 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal zinc finger
domains. The authors detected 3 human mRNA species by Northern blot
analysis: a 4.4-kb transcript, which was prominent in peripheral blood
leukocytes; a 6.0-kb transcript, which was strongly expressed in spleen,
thymus, lymph node, and bone marrow; and a 7.0-kb transcript. They
stated that the human and mouse Ikaros genes have similar overall
transcription patterns.

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger
domain of Ikaros proteins is involved in DNA binding, while the
C-terminal zinc finger domain mediates homo- or heterodimerization with
other Ikaros proteins. Alternative splicing of exons 3 to 6 produces
Ikaros isoforms with 0 to 4 N-terminal zinc fingers, and those with at
least 3 efficiently bind DNA. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms include
IK1, IK2, IK3, and IKX, and IK4 can bind DNA on palindromic sequences.
IK5, IK6, IK7, and IK8 are considered dominant-negative isoforms due to
their capacity to bind other isoforms and their inefficiency in binding
DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Harker et al. (2002) showed that Ikaros may play an important role in
CD4 (186940) versus CD8 (see CD8A; 186910) lineage commitment decisions
by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements in the
endogenous CD8A locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin
immunoprecipitations; (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect
variegation of transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements; and (3)
that mice with reduced levels of Ikaros and Aiolos (606221) show an
apparent increase in CD4 populations with immature phenotype, i.e.,
cells that fail to activate the CD8A gene. The authors proposed that
Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8A gene and that
their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin
remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage
commitment.

Ezzat et al. (2005) demonstrated that Ikaros is expressed in the
hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells of mice, where it
binds the proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene
expression. Ikaros-null mice had contraction of the pituitary
corticomelanotroph population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic
hormone levels, and adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency. Hematopoietic
reconstitution failed to correct this hormonal deficit, but the
phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished survival was rescued by
systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Ezzat et al. (2005)
concluded that Ikaros plays a role in orchestrating immune-endocrine
development and function.

Yap et al. (2005) identified Ikaros-binding elements in the 5-prime
flanking regions of pufferfish, mouse, and human STAT4 (600558).

analyses showed that Ikaros bound to the STAT4 promoter and was involved
in regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

Dijon et al. (2008) found that purified CD34 (142230)-positive human
cord blood cells and adult peripheral blood cells that were cultured
under erythroid conditions expressed the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms IK1
through IK4, but not the dominant-negative isoform IK6.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that expression of IK6 in these
cells resulted in complex formation between IK6 and IK1, and IK6
decreased cell number and increased cell death. IK6 overexpression
disturbed erythroid differentiation and expression of erythroid-specific
genes, although it had no effect on Ikaros expression, and favored
myelopoiesis by promoting expression of myeloid-specific genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the IKZF1 gene contains 7 translated
exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Molnar et al. (1996) mapped the human
Ikaros gene to 7p13-p11.1, near the EGFR gene (131550). They mapped the
mouse Ikaros gene to chromosome 11 by interspecific backcross analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ikaros is required for normal lymphocyte development. Germline mutant
mice that express only non-DNA-binding dominant-negative 'leukemogenic'
Ikaros isoforms lacking critical N-terminal zinc fingers develop an
aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia 3 to 6 months after birth (see
'Animal Model' below). These facts prompted Sun et al. (1999) to seek
molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL2; 613067) in infants. In leukemic cells from 12 ALL
infants less than 1 year of age, Sun et al. (1999) found high-level
expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal
subcellular compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide
sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect
Ikaros gene mutations in these cells. Leukemic cells from 7 of 7 infants
with ALL, including 5 of 5 MLL-AF4-positive (159557) infants, expressed
dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms IK4, IK7, and IK8 that lack critical
N-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 7 patients, Sun et al. (1999) detected
an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the
transcription-activation domain adjacent to the C-terminal zinc fingers
of IK2, IK4, IK7, and IK8. In contrast, only wildtype IK1 and IK2
isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in normal infant
bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicated the
expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of
normal Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.

Nakase et al. (2000) found overexpression of the dominant-negative IK6
isoform in 14 of 41 B-cell patients with adult B-cell ALL. None of the
other dominant-negative isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by
RT-PCR analysis. Southern blot analysis with PstI digestion revealed
that those patients with the dominant-negative IK6 isoform might have
small mutations in the Ikaros locus. The results suggested that Ikaros
plays a key role in human B-cell malignancies through the
dominant-negative isoform IK6.

Using RT-PCR to detect Ikaros isoforms with the 30-base deletion in exon
6, Payne et al. (2001) showed that transcripts for IK1 and IK1 with the
deletion were present in normal cord blood and bone marrow, as well as
in 3 ALL cell lines. In addition, they identified an isoform, IKX, that
was identical to IK3 except that it included exon 6; IKX was generated
from a novel exon combination with and without the 30-base deletion.
Payne et al. (2001) detected multiple DNA-binding and nonbinding
isoforms with a 60-base insertion linked to leukemia expressed at the
RNA level in normal hemopoietic cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that the predominant isoform in normal cells is IKX, while the
predominant form in leukemic cells is IK1.

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in IKZF1, IKZF3 (606221),TCF3 (147141), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes
BCR-ABL1 (see 151410, 189980), is the defining lesion of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to
induce ALL, Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of
diagnostic leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43
BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the
transcription factor Ikaros, was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but
not in chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an
acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid
blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency,
expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss
of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested
that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for
the deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Mullighan et al. (2009) identified deletions involving the IKZF1 gene in
leukemic cells of 63 (28.6%) of 221 children with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Cells from 20 patients had a deletion of coding
exons 3 through 6, resulting in the expression of a dominant-negative
form of IKZF1. IKZF1 deletions were associated with an increased risk of
relapse and adverse effects in the original cohort and in an independent
cohort of 258 patients (p values ranging from less than 0.001 to 0.004).

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
IKZF1 gene and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, see ALL2 (613067).

CYTOGENETICS

The BCL6 gene (109565), isolated from the breakpoints of 3q27-associated
chromosomal translocations, is implicated in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBL). Hosokawa et al. (2000) described the molecular
characterization of novel t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations in 2 patients
with DLBL. Molecular genetic analysis of the breakpoint area involving
BCL6 revealed the presence of the Ikaros gene. As a molecular
consequence of the translocation, the 5-prime regulatory region of BCL6
was replaced by the putative 5-prime regulatory region of the Ikaros
gene, probably leading to deregulated expression of the BCL6 gene
throughout B-cell differentiation. RT-PCR and FISH analyses of a patient
sample established that the translocation resulted in fusion of the
Ikaros and BCL6 genes. The clinical features of the 2 patients with DLBL
and t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations were reported by Ichinohasama et al.
(1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice homozygous for a germline mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain
lack not only T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but also
their earliest defined progenitors (Georgopoulos et al., 1994). In
contrast, the erythroid and myeloid lineages are intact in these mutant
mice. Klug et al. (1998) showed that the DNA-binding isoforms of mouse
Ikaros are localized in the nucleus of the most primitive hematopoietic
stem cell subset. They found that Ikaros localizes to heterochromatin in
Abelson-transformed pre-B lymphocytes. Changes in the RNA splicing
pattern of Ikaros occurred at 2 stages of lymphoid differentiation.

O'Neill et al. (1999, 2000) described the structure of a chromatin
remodeling complex associated with Ikaros that is present only in adult
hematopoietic cells. This complex binds to Ikaros-like DNA-binding
sites, including a long polypyrimidine-rich sequence upstream of the
human delta-globin gene (142000), and was thus called PYR complex.
Deletion of this sequence in a human beta locus-containing cosmid
(carrying sequences from the human gamma-A gene, 142200, through the
adult beta-globin gene, 141900) in transgenic mice resulted in delayed
switching from gamma-globin to beta-globin. Lopez et al. (2002) showed
that homozygous Ikaros-null mice lacked the PYR complex, demonstrating a
requirement for Ikaros in the formation of the complex on DNA.
Heterozygous Ikaros-null mice had about half as much PYR complex,
indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and PYR complex. They also
showed that Ikaros-null mice had multiple hematopoietic cell defects,
including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to
lymphoid and stem cell defects. The null mice also had a delay in murine
embryonic-to-adult beta-globin switching and a delay in human
gamma-to-beta switching, consistent with the suggested role for PYR
complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicated that
several hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages were
either up- or downregulated in 14-day embryos from Ikaros-null mice
compared with wildtype mice. These results indicated that Ikaros and PYR
complex function together in vivo at many adult hematopoietic
cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites, affecting their expression
and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized dendritic cells that
produce high levels of type I interferon (see IFNA1; 147660) upon viral
infection. Allman et al. (2006) showed that mice expressing low levels
of Ikaros lacked peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not other
dendritic cell subsets. Loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was
associated with inability to produce type I interferon after challenge
with Tlr7 (300365) or Tlr9 (605474) ligands or murine cytomegalovirus.
Conventional dendritic cells were present in normal numbers and
exhibited normal responses to in vivo challenge with murine
cytomegalovirus or inactivated toxoplasma antigen.

600983	TITLE *600983 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR SUBFAMILY 3, GROUP C, MEMBER 2; NR3C2
;;MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR; MLR; MCR; MR;;
ALDOSTERONE RECEPTOR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, are mainly involved in the
maintenance of water and salt homeostasis by regulating vectorial sodium
transport in tight epithelia. Aldosterone has also been implicated in
other physiologic processes, including development of cardiac fibrosis
and differentiation of brown adipose tissue. NR3C2, or mineralocorticoid
receptor (MR), belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and functions
as a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates the effects of
aldosterone on a variety of target tissues, including the distal parts
of the nephron, the distal colon, the cardiovascular and central nervous
systems, and brown adipose tissue. MR possesses the same affinity for
glucocorticoids as for mineralocorticoids, suggesting that it may also
function as a high-affinity glucocorticoid receptor (summary by Zennaro
et al., 2001).

CLONING

By low-stringency Southern analysis of placenta DNA using human
glucocorticoid receptor (GR, or GCCR; 138040) cDNA as probe, followed by
screening human kidney cDNA libraries, Arriza et al. (1987) cloned
NR3C2, which they called MR. The deduced 984-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 107 kD. Like glucocorticoid receptor,
mineralocorticoid receptor has an N-terminal cysteine-rich DNA-binding
region and a C-terminal steroid-binding domain separated by a putative
hinge region. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues detected Mr
expression in classic mineralocorticoid target tissues, such as kidney
and gut, as well as in brain, pituitary, and heart. It was also highly
expressed in hippocampus.

Using Western blot analysis, Alnemri et al. (1991) showed that human MR
was expressed in insect cells as 3 proteins with apparent molecular
masses of 115, 119, and 125 kD. These proteins were highly
phosphorylated. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that MR was primarily
cytoplasmic in the absence of aldosterone, and that activation by
aldosterone provoked translocation of the receptor to the nucleus.
Analytical gel filtration and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation
revealed that MR associated in a complex of 9S to 10S, which was reduced
to about 4S following activation by aldosterone.

Zennaro et al. (1995) identified 2 splice variants of MR, called
MR-alpha and -beta, that contain alternative first exons. The coding
region beginning in exon 2 is identical in MR-alpha and -beta. Using in
situ hybridization with exon-specific probes, Zennaro et al. (1997)
detected expression of both variants in all typical human MR-expressing
cells and tissues analyzed. MR-alpha and -beta were present in distal
tubules of kidney, in cardiomyocytes, in enterocytes of colonic mucosa,
and in keratinocytes and sweat glands. Zennaro et al. (1997)
demonstrated that MR-alpha and -beta were coexpressed in aldosterone
target tissues.

Bloem et al. (1995) identified an MR splice variant in both human and
rat that contains an additional 12 nucleotides at the 3-prime end of
exon 3, resulting in a 4-amino acid insertion in the DNA-binding domain.
RT-PCR detected the short and long MR variants in all rat tissues
examined and in human white blood cell mRNA. The long transcript was
less abundant in all rat tissues except liver, where both transcripts
appeared equally expressed.

Using RT-PCR, Zennaro et al. (2001) identified 3 splice variants of MR
that were variably expressed in human tissues and cell lines:
full-length MR, a variant lacking exon 5, and a variant lacking both
exons 5 and 6, which they called MR-delta-5,6. The variant lacking exon
5 encodes a protein lacking part of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain
and all of the hinge region. Skipping of both exons 5 and 6 in
MR-delta-5,6 introduces a frameshift and a premature stop codon,
resulting in a 706-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass
of 75 kD. MR-delta-5,6 includes the complete N-terminal DNA-binding
region of full-length MR, but it has a novel 35-amino acid tail
replacing the hinge region and hormone-binding domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zennaro et al. (1995) determined that the human MR gene spans over
approximately 400 kb and contains 10 exons. Exons 1-alpha and 1-beta are
composed only of 5-prime untranslated sequence and splice into a common
translated region. The N-terminal part of the receptor is encoded by
exon 2; small exons 3 and 4 encode each of the 2 zinc fingers of the
DNA-binding domain. The hormone-binding domain is encoded by exons 5
through 9.

MAPPING

Arriza et al. (1987) mapped the NR3C2 gene to chromosome 4 by testing
their cDNA against a panel of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids. To
confirm the assignment to chromosome 4, they tested a restricted set of
microcell hybrids, each of which carries 1 to 3 human chromosomes. By in
situ hybridization using a biotinylated cDNA clone, Morrison et al.
(1989, 1990) regionalized the NR3C2 gene to 4q31.1; by the same method,
Fan et al. (1989) assigned NR3C2 gene to 4q31.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Expression studies by Arriza et al. (1987) demonstrated the ability of
MR to bind aldosterone with high affinity and to activate gene
transcription in response to aldosterone. MR also showed high affinity
for glucocorticoids. Arriza et al. (1987) speculated that, since the
circulating level of glucocorticoids is several times higher than those
of aldosterone, the primary mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid activation
of MR may be functionally significant.

By assaying human MR overexpressed in insect cells, Alnemri et al.
(1991) showed that MR bound aldosterone, cortisol, cortexolone, and
progesterone with high affinity. MR bound immobilized DNA even as a
large inactive complex, and activation did not increase its DNA-binding
capacity.

Zennaro et al. (1995) found that expression of MR-beta was reduced in
sweat glands of 2 patients with mineralocorticoid abnormalities, one
with Conn syndrome and the other with Liddle syndrome (177200). However,
MR expression was not altered in a patient with type I
pseudohypoaldosteronism (see 177735).

The hormone-binding domain (HBD) of MR contains 4 cysteine residues,
C808, C849, C910, and C942, and Lupo et al. (1998) mutated each of these
into serine in an MR construct containing only the DNA-binding domain
(DBD), the hinge region, and the HBD. Most of these mutations altered
substrate affinity, but not substrate specificity, of the construct. The
C849S substitution reduced binding to aldosterone, and the C942S
substitution abrogated binding to all substrates tested. The wildtype
DBD-hinge-HBD construct showed about 20% of the transcriptional activity
of full-length MR in reporter gene assays. The C849S substitution
reduced the transcriptional activity of the construct, and the C942S
substitution inactivated the construct. Lupo et al. (1998) concluded
that C849 and C943 are critical for ligand binding of MR.

Using alanine scanning mutagenesis, Hellal-Levy et al. (2000) studied
the role of the residues of the loop connecting H11 and H12 in the
activation of the human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). H950A retained
the ligand binding and transcriptional activities of the wildtype
receptor and interacted with coactivators. In contrast, F956A had no
receptor functions. Aldosterone bound to the mutant MRs (L952A, K953A,
V954A, E955A, P957A) with nearly the same affinity as to the wildtype
receptor and caused a receptor conformational change in these mutant MRs
as it does for the wildtype receptor. The authors proposed that the
integrity of the H11-H12 loop is crucial for folding the receptor into a
ligand-binding competent state and for establishing the network of
contacts that stabilize the active receptor conformation.

Zennaro et al. (2001) showed that in vitro-translated MR-delta-5,6
lacked the ability to bind aldosterone or dexamethasone. MR-delta-5,6
bound DNA and functioned as a ligand-independent transactivator of the
consensus glucocorticoid response element (GRE) from the mouse mammary
tumor virus promoter. MR-delta-5,6 did not interact with full-length MR,
but coexpression of MR-delta-5,6 increased the transactivation potential
of full-length MR or GR at high doses of hormone. In addition,
MR-delta-5,6 recruited the coactivators SRC1 (NCOA1; 602691), RIP140
(NRIP1; 602490), and TIF1-alpha (TRIM24; 603406), which enhanced its
transcriptional activity. Zennaro et al. (2001) concluded that
MR-delta-5,6 may modulate corticosteroid effects in target tissues.

Aldosterone enhances angiotensin II (see 106150)-induced PAI1 (173360)
expression in vitro. Sawathiparnich et al. (2003) tested the hypothesis
that angiotensin II type 1 and aldosterone receptor antagonism interact
to decrease PAI1 in humans. Effects of candesartan, spironolactone, or
combined candesartan/spironolactone on mean arterial pressure,
endocrine, and fibrinolytic variables were measured in 18 normotensive
subjects in whom the renin (179820)-angiotensin-aldosterone system was
activated by furosemide. This study evidenced an interactive effect of
endogenous angiotensin II and aldosterone on PAI1 production in humans.

Shibata et al. (2008) showed that a constitutively active RAC1 (602048)
mutant potentiated aldosterone-induced mineralocorticoid receptor
nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity in HEK293 cells
transfected with human constructs. In cultured rat podocytes, activated
RAC1 facilitated mineralocorticoid receptor nuclear accumulation via
p21-activated kinase (PAK; see 602590) phosphorylation. Shibata et al.
(2008) found that mice lacking Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor-alpha
(ARHGDIA; 601925) developed progressive renal disease characterized by
heavy albuminuria and podocyte damage. These renal changes were
associated with increased Rac1 and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling
in the kidney without alteration in systemic aldosterone status.
Pharmacologic intervention with a Rac-specific small molecule inhibitor
diminished mineralocorticoid receptor overactivity and renal damage.
Furthermore, mineralocorticoid receptor blockade suppressed albuminuria
and histologic changes in Arhgdia -/- mice. Shibata et al. (2008)
concluded that RAC1 modulates mineralocorticoid receptor activity, and
that activation of the RAC1-mineralocorticoid receptor pathway has a
major role in the pathogenesis of renal damage.

Jeong et al. (2009) noted that aldosterone interacts with MR to activate
transcription of proinflammatory genes, in addition to activating
inflammatory signaling pathways in an MR-independent manner. They showed
that aldosterone triggered exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies from human
aortic endothelial cells, causing the release of proinflammatory
mediators. Small interfering RNA directed against MR reduced the effect
of aldosterone on exocytosis. Exocytosis also required calcium
signaling.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Some evidence has been presented that the mutation causing autosomal
recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) type I (264350) is located in
the MLR gene; however, this possibility was excluded by Chung et al.
(1995) by linkage analysis which demonstrated lod scores less than -2
over the whole region from D4S192 to D4S413 encompassing MLR. The
analysis was carried out in 10 inbred families using 3 simple sequence
length (SSL) polymorphisms spanning the MLR region; the approach
represented homozygosity mapping.

Although the studies of Chung et al. (1995) excluded MLR as the site of
the mutation causing autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism type I,
Geller et al. (1998) presented evidence that the autosomal dominant form
of the disorder (177735) can be caused by mutations in the MLR gene.
Autosomal dominant or sporadic PHA1 is a milder disease than the
autosomal recessive form and remits with age. Among 6 dominant and 7
sporadic PHA1 kindreds, Geller et al. (1998) found no mutations in the
epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) genes (600228, 600760) in which
mutations have been found in the autosomal recessive form of PHA1. As
ENaC activity in the kidney is regulated by aldosterone acting through
the mineralocorticoid receptor, Geller et al. (1998) screened the MLR
gene for variants and identified heterozygous mutations in 1 sporadic
and 4 dominant kindreds. These included 2 frameshift mutations (1 a de
novo mutation), 2 premature termination codons, and a splice donor
mutation.

Geller et al. (2000) screened the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in 75
patients with early onset of severe hypertension (605115). A 15-year-old
boy with severe hypertension, suppressed plasma renin activity, low
serum aldosterone, and no other underlying cause of hypertension was
heterozygous for a missense mutation, resulting in substitution of a
leucine for serine at codon 810 (600983.0005). Of 23 relatives of the
proband, 11 were diagnosed with severe hypertension before age 20 years,
and the MR S810L mutation precisely cosegregated with early-onset
hypertension in this family. This mutation resulted in constitutive MR
activity and altered receptor specificity, with progesterone and other
steroids lacking 21-hydroxyl groups, normally MR antagonists, becoming
potent agonists.

In a Japanese patient with sporadic PHA, Arai et al. (2003) found 3
homozygous substitutions in the MR gene that had previously been
reported to occur in healthy populations. Luciferase activities induced
by MR were significantly lower for each of the 3 substitutions than
those for wildtype MR with aldosterone at 3 different concentrations..
Arai et al. (2003) suggested that 2 or more 'functional' polymorphisms,
any of which exhibits only slight effects on MR function alone and is
incapable of causing PHA, may in the right allelic combination induce
the negative salt conservation characteristic of PHA.

Sartorato et al. (2003) analyzed the NR3C2 gene in 14 families with
autosomal dominant or sporadic PHA1. They detected 6 heterozygous
mutations that differently affected protein structure and function. The
authors concluded that NR3C2 mutations are a common feature of autosomal
dominant PHA1, being found in 70% of their familial cases. Sartorato et
al. (2003) used the numbering of Arriza et al. (1987) to refer to the
mutations.

Pujo et al. (2007) identified 22 abnormalities of the NR3C2 gene in 33
patients with type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism. Altogether, 68% of the
mutations were dominantly transmitted, while 18% were de novo mutations.

Riepe et al. (2006) detected 6 heterozygous NR3C2 mutations in 7
pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) patients from 6 unrelated
families. Two frameshift mutations, 1131dupT (600983.0008) and 2871dupC
(600983.0006) had been reported. They also reported 2 novel nonsense
mutations and 2 missense mutations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Berger et al. (1998) generated MLR-deficient mice by gene targeting.
These mice had a normal prenatal development. During the first week of
life, the MLR-deficient mice developed symptoms of
pseudohypoaldosteronism. They lost weight and eventually died at
approximately 10 days after birth from dehydration by renal sodium and
water loss. At day 8, MLR -/- mice showed hyperkalemia, hyponatremia,
and a strong increase in renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone plasma
concentrations. The fractional renal Na+ excretion was elevated more
than 8-fold. The glomerular filtration rate in MLR -/- mice was not
different from that in controls. The effect of amiloride on renal Na+
excretion in colonic transepithelial voltage reflected the function of
amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channels.

Le Menuet et al. (2001) generated transgenic (TG) mice with the proximal
human MR promoter to drive expression of human MR in aldosterone target
tissues. Ribonuclease protection analysis revealed human MR expression
in mineralocorticoid-sensitive tissues, notably kidney and heart.
Histologic analysis showed that enlarged kidneys were associated with
renal tubular dilation and cellular vacuolization, the prevalence of
which increased with aging. Urinary potassium excretion rates were
decreased in the TG mice. Although blood pressure was normal, the TG
mice developed mild dilated cardiomyopathy accompanied by a significant
heart rate increase and an increase in cardiac ANP (NPPA; 108780), renal
and cardiac serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK; 602958), and
early growth response-1 (EGR1; 128990).

Berger et al. (2006) conditionally deleted the MR gene in the forebrain
of mice and screened them in various learning and exploration tests.
Mutant mice showed impaired learning of the water maze task and deficits
in measures of working memory on the radial maze due to behavioral
perseverance and stereotypy. They showed hyperactive exploration toward
novel objects but normal anxiety-like behavior. The behavioral changes
were associated with abnormalities of the mossy fiber projection and
upregulated glucocorticoid receptor (GCCR; 138040) expression in the
hippocampus. Adult mutant mice showed normal basal circadian
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, 1-BP DEL, 1226G

In a sporadic case of type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (177735), Geller et
al. (1998) found heterozygosity for a de novo single-bp deletion,
introducing a frameshift at codon 335 and resulting in premature
termination at codon 337.

.0002
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT

In a mother and son with type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (177735), Geller
et al. (1998) found heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion, introducing a
frameshift at codon 459 and resulting in premature termination at codon
474.

NR3C2, ARG537TER

In multiple subjects affected with type I pseudohypoaldosteronism
(177735) in each of 2 presumably unrelated families, Geller et al.
(1998) found heterozygosity for a C-to-T transition that converted codon
537 from CGA (arg) to TGA (stop).

.0004

NR3C2, IVS5, 1-BP DEL, A, +3

In affected subjects in a kindred with type I pseudohypoaldosteronism
(177735), Geller et al. (1998) found heterozygosity for a single-bp
deletion in the donor splice site following exon 5. The third basepair
of the splice donor site was deleted in the mutant allele so that gtagg
became gtgg.

.0005
HYPERTENSION, EARLY-ONSET, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, WITH EXACERBATION IN
PREGNANCY
NR3C2, SER810LEU

Geller et al. (2000) screened the mineralocorticoid receptor in 75
patients with early onset of severe hypertension (605115). In a
15-year-old boy with severe hypertension, a C-to-T substitution,
changing codon 810 of the hormone-binding domain from a serine to a
leucine, was identified. The ser810-to-leu (S810L) mutation was
identified in heterozygous state in 11 family members of this proband
who had been diagnosed with severe hypertension before the age of 20
years, resulting in constitutive MR activity and altered receptor
specificity, with progesterone and other steroids lacking 21-hydroxyl
groups, normally MR antagonists, becoming potent agonists. This resulted
in profound exacerbation of hypertension during 5 pregnancies in 2
affected women in this kindred. Structural and biochemical studies
indicated that S810L results in the gain of a van der Waals interaction
between helix 5 and helix 3 that substitutes for interaction of the
steroid 21-hydroxyl group with helix 3 in the wildtype receptor. This
helix 5-helix 3 interaction is highly conserved among diverse nuclear
hormone receptors, suggesting its general role in receptor activation.
The effect of the S810L mutation was to invert the mineralocorticoid
receptor from aldosterone-responsive to progesterone-responsive, with
development of hypertension during pregnancy. This was the first
mendelian form of preeclampsia to be identified. Ordinarily, blood
pressure goes down during early stages of pregnancy.

.0006
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, 1-BP INS, 2871C

In a sporadic case of type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (177735), Viemann
et al. (2001) found a heterozygous insertion of a cytosine at position
2871 in exon 9. This mutation leads to a frameshift, which results in a
nonsense protein from codon 958 and a first stop codon at position 1012.

Riepe et al. (2006) detected this mutation in a patient with PHA1. They
showed that the receptor lacked aldosterone-binding and transactivation
capabilities because of a major change in receptor conformation.

.0007
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, LEU924PRO

Tajima et al. (2000) studied the molecular mechanisms of 1 Japanese
family with a renal form of PHA1 (177735). PCR and direct sequencing of
the mineralocorticoid receptor gene identified a heterozygous point
mutation changing codon 924, leucine (CTG) to CCG (proline) (L924P), in
all affected members. In vitro expression studies demonstrated that the
L924P mutation results in complete absence of MR function.

.0008
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, 1-BP INS, 1354T

In twins and their brother and mother in a family with PHA1 (177735),
Sartorato et al. (2003) found insertion of a thymine at nucleotide
position 1345 in exon 2 of the MR gene, resulting in frameshift and
premature termination of the receptor at amino acid 378 (E378X).

Riepe et al. (2006) detected this mutation in an Italian family. They
referred to the mutation as 1131dupT, with numbering beginning at the A
of the initiation codon.

.0009
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, 8-BP DEL, NT537

In a family with PHA1 (177735), Sartorato et al. (2003) found in 2 sibs
and their mother a deletion of 8 bp in exon 2 of the MR gene
(del8bp537). The frameshift resulted in a truncated protein with 8 novel
residues after ser104, followed by a premature stop codon.

.0010
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, CYS645TER

In a patient with PHA1 (177735), Sartorato et al. (2003) found a C-to-A
transversion at nucleotide 2157 in exon 4 of the MR gene that caused a
cys645-to-ter (C645X) truncation in the second zinc finger of the MR
DNA-binding domain. The mutation was apparently sporadic.

.0011
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, GLN776ARG

In a proband, her mother, and maternal grandfather with PHA1 (177735),
Sartorato et al. (2003) found an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 2549 in
exon 5 of the MR gene, changing gln776 to arg (Q776R) in the
ligand-binding domain of the mineralocorticoid receptor. Q776R mutant
protein displayed only 30% of maximal aldosterone binding.

.0012
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, GLY633ARG

In 2 brothers and all 4 of their offspring with PHA1 (177735), Sartorato
et al. (2003) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 2119, the last
nucleotide of exon 3, that caused substitution of gly633 with arg
(G633R). The G633R mutation exhibited reduced maximal transactivation,
although its binding characteristics and ED50 of transactivation were
comparable with those of wildtype MR.

.0013
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, LEU979PRO

In a proband and her mother with PHA1 (177735), Sartorato et al. (2003)
found a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 3158 in exon 9 of the MR gene,
resulting in a leu-to-pro change at codon 979 (L979P) in the
ligand-binding domain. L979P was shown to exert a transdominant-negative
effect on wildtype MR activity, and mutant protein demonstrated no
aldosterone-binding activity.

.0014
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, SER163TER

In a German patient with a renal form of PHA1 (177735), Riepe et al.
(2003) detected a heterozygous point mutation, 488C-G in exon 2 of the
NR3C2 gene, that resulted in substitution of a premature termination
codon for serine-163 (S163X). Segregation analysis revealed the same
mutation in the patient's father, who had shown no symptoms of PHA.
Riepe et al. (2003) sought polymorphisms in the amiloride-sensitive
epithelial sodium channel (ENaC; see 600228) as the basis of the
phenotypic differences within the family; sequencing revealed identical
ENaC haplotypes in the patient and his father, indicating that these
polymorphisms could not be responsible for the difference in clinical
presentation.

.0015
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C2, ARG947TER

In a Turkish infant with a renal form of PHA1 (177735), Riepe et al.
(2004) detected a heterozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 3055 in
exon 9 of the NR3C2 gene that caused premature termination of the
mineralocorticoid receptor at arginine-947 (R947X). The truncated
receptor was free of aldosterone binding. Segregation analysis revealed
the identical mutation in the patient's father, who was clinically free
of symptoms and showed normal plasma electrolytes and aldosterone
urinary metabolites and only slightly elevated plasma renin and
aldosterone levels. The authors concluded that their findings supported
the hypothesis that PHA1 due to NR3C2 mutations can show incomplete
penetrance, although a mild salt loss might have been overlooked in the
father's childhood.

In 2 families with autosomal dominant PHA1, unrelated to the family
described by Riepe et al. (2004), Fernandes-Rosa et al. (2006)
identified the R947X mutation. Different haplotypes segregated with the
mutation in each family, suggested that codon 947 is a mutation hotspot.

.0016
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C1, CYS436TER

In the index patient of a 5-generation Swedish family with 15 affected
members with autosomal dominant PHA1 (177735), Nystrom et al. (2004)
found a heterozygous T-to-A transversion at nucleotide 1308 in exon 2 of
the NR3C1 gene that caused premature termination of the
mineralocorticoid receptor at codon 436 (C436X). The mutation was found
to segregate with PHA1 in the family. Complete abrogation of the DNA-
and hormone-binding domains was predicted in the truncated mutant
protein. Interestingly, neuropathy was found in 2 of 5 affected
individuals. It was unclear whether the neuropathy was associated with
the mutation found.

.0017
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C1, ARG673TER

In a proband and her mother with PHA1 (177735), Riepe et al. (2006)
found a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2017 in exon 5 of the NR3C1
gene, resulting in premature termination of the protein at arg673
(R673X). The mutation deleted the ligand-binding domain. While plasma
aldosterone and renin activity were elevated in the mother, she had no
recollection of treatment or hospitalization related to this condition.

.0018
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C1, SER675TER

In a patient with PHA1 (177735), Riepe et al. (2006) detected a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 2024 in exon 5 of the NR3C1 gene that caused
termination of the protein at ser675 (S675X). The mutation deleted the
ligand-binding domain.

.0019
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C1, SER181LEU

In 2 sibs with PHA1 (177735) and their father, Riepe et al. (2006)
detected a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 2453 in exon 6 of the NR3C1
gene, resulting in substitution of leu for ser at codon 181 (S181L).
This mutation had been reported by Geller et al. (2006). The S181L
mutant showed no aldosterone binding, transcription activation, or
translocation to the nucleus. Based on in vitro studies Riepe et al.
(2006) hypothesized that substitution of the bulky apolar leucine for
serine-818 displaces beta-sheet-1, which severely disturbs the
interaction of the receptor with its ligand.

.0020
PSEUDOHYPOALDOSTERONISM, TYPE I, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
NR3C1, GLU972GLY

In a patient with PHA1 (177735) and his mother, Riepe et al. (2006)
detected a 2915A-G transition in exon 9 of the NR3C1 gene that resulted
in substitution of gly for glu972 (E972G). The novel E972G mutation
showed a significantly lower ligand-binding affinity and only 9% of
wildtype transcriptional activity caused by major changes in receptor
conformation. The mutation was predicted to open the hydrophobic core of
the protein and displace helix H10, disturbing the interaction of the
receptor with its ligand.

604460	TITLE *604460 FAS-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 1; FAF1
;;HFAF1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Interaction of Fas ligand (TNFSF6; 134638) with the FAS antigen
(TNFRSF6; 134637) mediates programmed cell death, also called apoptosis,
in a number of organ systems, notably the immune and nervous systems.
Although these molecules are in the same family as TNF-alpha (191160)
and TNFR (191190), the latter function to activate not only apoptosis
but also NFKB1 (164011), a key transcription factor in chronic
inflammatory diseases. By screening tumor-related proteins derived from
a HeLa cDNA library in a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Ryu et al. (1999)
isolated a truncated version of FAS-associated factor-1 (FAF1), which
can enhance but not initiate apoptosis. Using PCR as well as sequence
information from an EST database to screen HeLa as well as brain and
kidney cDNA libraries, they derived a product corresponding to the
expected size of the complete coding region of 1,970 bp. The deduced
amino acid sequence was 96% and 85% homologous to mouse and quail Faf1,
respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed a single FAF1 mRNA
transcript of 2.8 kb to be most abundant in testis, slightly less
abundant in skeletal muscle and heart, followed by prostate, thymus,
ovary, small intestine, and colon. Expression was detected in all other
tissues tested with the exception of peripheral blood leukocytes. By
immunoblotting with a mouse polyclonal antibody to FAF1, a 74-kD protein
was detected in 6 of 8 tumor cell lines. A 40-kD protein was detected in
1 of the 2 remaining cell lines. Interaction of FAF1 and FAS was shown
in both the yeast 2-hybrid and the GST pull-down assay systems. The
N-terminal 201 amino acids of FAF1, containing a ubiquitin homology
domain, bound to the FAS death domain but not to a death domain mutant
in the yeast 2-hybrid system.

Using whole-mount in-situ hybridization in zebrafish embryos,
Ghassibe-Sabbagh et al. (2011) detected faf1 transcripts at 24 and 30
hours postfertilization (hpf) in the pharyngeal arch primordia. At 56
hpf, when the pharyngeal cartilages were forming, faf1 was strongly
expressed in all arches, with the most prominent expression in the first
(mandibular) and second (hyoid) arch. Knockdown of zebrafish faf1 led to
pharyngeal cartilage defects and jaw abnormalities as a result of a
failure of the cranial neural crest to differentiate and to express
cartilage-specific markers, such as sox9a (see 608160) and col2a1 (see
120140). Administration of faf1 mRNA rescued the phenotype.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the FAF1 gene to chromosome 1p32.3 based on an
alignment of the FAF1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF136173) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607103	TITLE *607103 ARGINYLTRANSFERASE 1; ATE1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the
identity of its N-terminal residue. N-terminal arginine is a primary
destabilizing residue for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, while
N-terminal aspartate and glutamate are secondary destabilizing residues
due to their role as substrates for arginylation by ATE1.

CLONING

Based on sequence similarity to mouse Ate1, Kwon et al. (1999)
identified human ATE1 within an EST clone and subsequently cloned 2
forms of ATE1 cDNA from human embryonic kidney cells. They determined
that the 2 variants of ATE1, which they termed ATE1-1 and ATE1-2, are
found in both human and mouse and result from the use of alternate
second exons. In mouse, both variants encode deduced 516-amino acid
proteins with calculated molecular masses of about 59 kD. The 43-residue
sequences encoded by the alternate exons are 31% identical. Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues revealed a 5-kb transcript in all tissues
tested except testis, where the major transcript was 2 kb. Restriction
digests of the transcripts suggested that the ratio of Ate1-1 to Ate1-2
varies between tissues. Transfection of fluorescence-tagged Ate1-1 into
mouse fibroblasts resulted in both nuclear and cytosolic localization,
whereas Ate1-2 localization was exclusively cytosolic.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kwon et al. (2002) generated mice lacking ATE1. Ate1 -/- embryos died
with defects in heart development and in angiogenic remodeling of the
early vascular plexus. Through biochemical analyses, Kwon et al. (2002)
demonstrated that the N-terminal cysteine, in contrast to N-terminal
aspartate and glutamate, is oxidized before its arginylation by
R-transferase, suggesting that the arginylation branch of the N-end rule
pathway functions as an oxygen sensor. Ate1 +/- mice were apparently
normal, but Ate1 knockout embryos were pale and had thinner blood
vessels and frequent skin edema in embryonic days 9.5 to 12.5.
Hemorrhages were a consistent feature of homozygous mutant embryos and
were the likely proximal cause of death. Of 22 Ate1 -/- hearts examined
at embryonic days 13.5 to 15.5, about 85% had an atrial septal defect.
The atria were thin-walled with sparse trabeculae and a large atrial
septal defect. About 90% of examined Ate1-knockout embryonic hearts
exhibited hypoplasia of both the right and left ventricular myocardium.
The compact zone of the left ventricular myocardium was 2 or 3 cells
thick, in contrast to 7 to 10 cells in wildtype embryos. About 70% of
knockout Ate1 knockout mice had persistent truncus arteriosus, with the
common root of the aorta and pulmonary artery straddling a large ventral
septal defect. Vasculogenesis was normal at embryonic day 9.5, but
angiogenic remodeling was suppressed. Kwon et al. (2002) identified a
physiologic function for the posttranslational conjugation of arginine
to N-termini of proteins, a reaction first described by Kaji et al.
(1963). Kwon et al. (2002) also showed that the N-terminal cysteine
undergoes 2 covalent modifications, oxidation and arginylation, by the
N-end rule pathway. Methionine-aminopeptidases cleave off the N-terminal
methionine of the newly formed protein if a second residue is small
enough. Among the arginylatable residues, only cysteine satisfies this
condition.

In immunoprecipitation studies of embryonic fibroblasts from wildtype
and knockout mice deficient in the arginylation enzyme Ate1, Karakozova
et al. (2006) found that approximately 40% of intracellular beta-actin
(102630) is arginylated in vivo. In both wildtype and Ate1-null cells
beta-actin was stable, suggesting that arginylation does not induce
beta-actin degradation. Karakozova et al. (2006) found that arginylation
of beta-actin regulates cell motility. The majority of Ate1-null cells
appeared smaller than wildtype cells and were apparently unable to form
lamellae during movement along the substrate. Ate-null cells failed to
form normal lamellae during motility, resulting in their inability to
cover the same distance or occupy the same area of th substrate as the
control cells. In addition, Ate1-null cells exhibited apparent defects
in ruffling activity and cortical flow. Karakozova et al. (2006)
concluded that arginylation of beta-actin apparently represents a
critical step in the actin N-terminal processing needed for actin
functioning in vivo.

GENE FUNCTION

By stabilization assays and N-terminal sequencing of beta-galactosidase
substrate proteins, Kwon et al. (1999) found that both mouse Ate1-1 and
Ate1-2 conferred instability on asp-beta-galactosidase through
arginylation of the N-terminal asp. Cys-beta-galactosidase was a
less-efficient substrate.

The conjugation of arginine to proteins is a part of the N-end rule
pathway of protein degradation. Three N-terminal residues--aspartate,
glutamate, and cysteine--are arginylated by ATE1-encoded
arginyl-transferases. Hu et al. (2005) reported that oxidation of
N-terminal cysteine is essential for its arginylation. They showed that
the in vivo oxidation of N-terminal cysteine, before its arginylation,
requires nitric oxide, and reconstituted this process in vitro as well.
The levels of regulatory proteins bearing N-terminal cysteine, such as
RGS4 (602516), RGS5 (603276), and RGS16 (602514), were greatly increased
in mouse Ate1-null embryos, which lack arginylation. Stabilization of
these proteins, the first physiologic substrates of mammalian N-end rule
pathway, may underlie cardiovascular defects in Ate1-null embryos. Hu et
al. (2005) concluded that their findings identify the N-end rule pathway
as a new nitric oxide sensor that functions through its ability to
destroy specific regulatory proteins bearing N-terminal cysteine, at
rates controlled by nitric oxide and apparently by oxygen as well.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kwon et al. (1999) determined that the mouse Ate1 gene contains 3 exons.
Two alternate 129-bp regions, which are separated by 0.8 kb, are used as
exon 2.

614471	TITLE *614471 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 19; USP19
;;KIAA0891
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

USP19 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (EC 3.4.19.12) with a role in
regulating cell cycle progression (Lu et al., 2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned USP19, which they designated
KIAA0891. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the ubiquitin protease UNPH (USP4; 603486). RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression in fetal liver, followed by adult spinal
cord. All other tissues, including adult and fetal brain, showed much
lower expression, and no expression was detected in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that
regulates the G1/S transition. Using rat myoblast and fibroblast cell
lines, Lu et al. (2009) showed that Usp19 regulated p27(KIP1) levels by
deubiquitinating and stabilizing Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that ubiquitinates cytosolic p27(KIP1) and targets it for
proteasomal degradation at G1 phase. Immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that Usp19 interacted directly with Kpc1. Knockdown of Usp19
resulted in loss of Kpc1, accumulation of p27(KIP1), inhibition of cell
proliferation, and slower progression from G0/G1 to S phase.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the USP19 gene
to chromosome 3.

Hartz (2011) mapped the USP19 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the USP19 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020698) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By examining regions of chromosomes 7 and 12 containing low-copy repeats
of a sequence similar to C. elegans Dpy19, Carson et al. (2006)
identified DPY19L1 (613892), DPY19L2 (613893), and 6 related
pseudogenes. Database analysis revealed 2 additional human genes,
DPY19L3 (613894) and DPY19L4, as well as mouse orthologs of all 4
functional human genes. The deduced 723-amino acid human DPY19L4 protein
contains at least 9 transmembrane domains. RT-PCR of human tissues
revealed variable but ubiquitous DPY19L4 expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Carson et al. (2006) determined that the DPY19L4 gene contains 18 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Carson et al. (2006) mapped the DPY19L4
gene to chromosome 8q22.1.

;;ZRT- AND IRT-LIKE PROTEIN 3; ZIP3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching with the sequences of fungal and plant zinc
transporters, Gaither and Eide (2000) identified 3 human members of the
ZIP superfamily: ZIP1 (SLC39A1; 604740), ZIP2 (SLC39A2; 612166), and
ZIP3 (SLC39A3). The 3 deduced human proteins share greater than 49%
similarity.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SLC39A3
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH81024).

GENE FUNCTION

Desouki et al. (2007) noted that normal human prostate glandular
epithelium has the unique function of accumulating high levels of zinc
and that in prostate cancer this capability is lost as an early event in
the development of the malignant cells. By immunohistochemistry analysis
of human normal and malignant prostate tissue sections, they determined
that, like SLC39A1, both SLC39A2 and SLC39A3 are downregulated in
malignant cells in situ along with the depletion of zinc levels. SLC39A2
and SLC39A3 were localized predominantly at the apical cell membrane,
which is in contrast to the SLC39A1 localization at the basolateral
membrane. Desouki et al. (2007) suggested that SLC39A1 is important for
the extraction of zinc from circulation as the primary source of
cellular zinc, whereas SLC39A2 and SLC39A3 are important for retention
of the zinc in the cellular compartment. They proposed that zinc is a
tumor suppressor agent and that SLC39A1, SLC39A2, and SLC39A3 are tumor
suppressor genes.

;;VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 22, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; VPS22;;
ELL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 30-KD; EAP30
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNF8, VPS25 (610907), and VPS36 (610903) form ESCRT-II (endosomal
sorting complex required for transport II), a complex involved in
endocytosis of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. SNF8, VPS25, and VPS36
are also associated in a multiprotein complex with RNA polymerase II
elongation factor (ELL; 600284) (Slagsvold et al., 2005; Kamura et al.,
2001).

CLONING

Schmidt et al. (1999) purified the Ell-containing complex from rat liver
extracts, and by peptide sequencing and EST database analysis, they
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding SNF8, which they called EAP30. The
deduced protein contains 258 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Schmidt et al. (1999) found that recombinant EAP30 could interact with
recombinant ELL in vitro and derepress the inhibitory activity of ELL
against RNA polymerase II (see 180660).

Using mouse proteins expressed in mammalian and insect cells, Kamura et
al. (2001) found that Eap30 and Eap20 (VPS25) could be
coimmunoprecipitated in the absence of Eap45 (VPS36), and that Eap20 and
Eap45 could be coimmunoprecipitated in the absence of Eap30. However,
little Eap30 was coimmunoprecipitated with Eap45 in the absence of
Eap20. Kamura et al. (2001) concluded that EAP20 bridges EAP30 and EAP45
and thereby nucleates assembly of the EAP complex.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Embryologic experiments in both vertebrates and invertebrates provide
evidence that developing axons are guided to their targets in the
nervous system by the combined actions of attractive and repulsive
guidance cues (Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996). One family of
putative guidance cues for developing axons are the netrins, large
(approximately 70-80 kD), soluble proteins that show homology in their
amino termini to portions of the extracellular matrix molecule laminin
(see 150320) and that have been implicated in axon guidance through
distinct and complementary lines of evidence in worms, flies, and
vertebrates. Netrin-1 is a diffusible protein made by floor plate cells;
it can attract spinal commissural axons and repel trochlear axons in
vitro (summary by Serafini et al., 1996).

CLONING

Serafini et al. (1996) isolated cDNA clones comprising the entire coding
region of murine netrin-1. PCR was performed on reverse-transcribed
mouse brain poly(A)+ RNA using primers based upon sequence homologies
between chick netrin-1 and C. elegans Unc6.

Using degenerate PCR primers derived from highly conserved C-terminal
domains of chicken netrin-1, netrin-2 (see 602349), and Unc6 proteins,
followed by screening of a human brainstem cDNA library, Meyerhardt et
al. (1999) isolated NTN1 cDNA. The NTN1 gene encodes a 604-amino acid
protein with 98% identity to mouse netrin-1 and 50% identity to C.
elegans Unc6. Northern blot analysis detected a 5.0-kb NTN1 transcript
in most normal adult human tissues studied. Markedly reduced or absent
NTN1 expression was seen in approximately 50% of brain tumors and
neuroblastomas by RNase protection assays.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Xenopus, Hopker et al. (1999) demonstrated that laminin-1-beta
(150240) from the extracellular matrix converts netrin-mediated
attraction into repulsion. A soluble peptide fragment of laminin-1-beta
(YIGSR) mimicked this laminin-induced conversion. Low levels of cAMP in
growth cones also led to the conversion of netrin-induced attraction
into repulsion, and Hopker et al. (1999) showed that the amount of cAMP
decreases in the presence of laminin-1 or YIGSR, suggesting a possible
mechanism for laminin's effect. At the netrin-1-rich optic nerve head,
where axons turn sharply to leave the eye, laminin-1 is confined to the
retinal surface. Repulsion from the region in which laminin and netrin
are coexpressed may help to drive axons into the region where only
netrin is present, providing a mechanism for their escape from the
retinal surface. Hopker et al. (1999) concluded that extracellular
matrix molecules not only promote axon outgrowth, but also modify the
behavior of growth cones in response to diffusible guidance cues.

Meyerhardt et al. (1999) showed that netrin-1 protein could be
crosslinked to DCC (120470) protein on the cell surface, but did not
immunoprecipitate with DCC in the absence of crosslinking and failed to
bind to a soluble fusion protein containing the entire DCC extracellular
domain. Meyerhardt et al. (1999) concluded that the binding of netrin-1
to DCC appears to depend on the presence of a coreceptor or accessory
proteins.

The axonal chemoattractant netrin-1 guides spinal commissural axons by
activating its receptor DCC. Galko and Tessier-Lavigne (2000) found that
chemical inhibitors of metalloproteases potentiate netrin-mediated axon
outgrowth in vitro. Galko and Tessier-Lavigne (2000) also found that DCC
is a substrate for metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding, and
that the inhibitors block proteolytic processing of DCC and cause an
increase in DCC protein levels on axons within spinal cord explants.
Thus, Galko and Tessier-Lavigne (2000) suggested that potentiation of
netrin activity by inhibitors may result from stabilization of DCC on
the axons, and proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration by
controlling the number of functional extracellular axon guidance
receptors.

Corset et al. (2000) showed that DCC interacts with the
membrane-associated adenosine A2b receptor (600466), a G protein-coupled
receptor that induces cAMP accumulation on binding adenosine. Corset et
al. (2000) showed that adenosine A2b receptor is actually a netrin-1
receptor and induces cAMP accumulation on binding netrin-1, and that
netrin-1-dependent outgrowth of dorsal spinal cord axons directly
involves A2b. Corset et al. (2000) concluded that the growth-promoting
function of netrin-1 may require a receptor complex containing DCC and
A2b.

Stein et al. (2001) demonstrated that netrin-1 binds DCC and that the
DCC cytoplasmic domain fused to a heterologous receptor ectodomain can
mediate guidance through a mechanism involving derepression of
cytoplasmic domain multimerization. Activation of the adenosine A2B
receptor, proposed to contribute to netrin effects on axons, is not
required for rat commissural axon outgrowth or Xenopus spinal axon
attraction to netrin-1. Thus, Stein et al. (2001) concluded that DCC
plays a central role in netrin signaling of axon growth and guidance
independent of A2B receptor activation.

Axonal growth cones that cross the nervous system midline change their
responsiveness to midline guidance cues: they become repelled by the
repellent Slit (603746) and simultaneously lose responsiveness to the
attractant netrin. These mutually reinforcing changes help to expel
growth cones from the midline by making a once-attractive environment
appear repulsive. Stein and Tessier-Lavigne (2001) provided evidence
that these 2 changes are causally linked: in the growth cones of
embryonic Xenopus spinal axons, activation of the Slit receptor
Roundabout (Robo; 602430) silences the attractive effect of netrin-1,
but not its growth-stimulatory effect, through direct binding of the
cytoplasmic domain of Robo to that of the netrin receptor DCC.
Biologically, this hierarchical silencing mechanism helps to prevent a
tug-of-war between attractive and repulsive signals in the growth cone
that might cause confusion. Molecularly, silencing is enabled by a
modular and interlocking design of the cytoplasmic domains of these
potentially antagonistic receptors that predetermines the outcome of
their simultaneous activation.

In a 'whole-optic pathway' preparation in Xenopus devised to assess the
behavior of retinal growth cones at 4 defined points along the optic
pathway, Shewan et al. (2002) found a gradual change in axonal response
to netrin-1, from attraction to repulsion at progressively distal points
along the pathway. Axons aged in culture underwent similar changes which
correlated with a decline in cAMP and netrin-1 receptor (ADORA2B;
600446) expression, suggesting that responsiveness is intrinsically and
developmentally regulated, and also suggesting a possible molecular
basis for the altered responsiveness.

Forcet et al. (2002) showed that in embryonic kidney cells expressing
full-length, but not cytoplasmic domain-truncated, DCC (120470), NTN1
causes increased transient phosphorylation and activity of ERK1 (601795)
and ERK2 (176948), but not of JNK1 (601158), JNK2 (602896), or p38
(MAPK14; 600289). This phosphorylation was mediated by MEK1 (MAP2K1;
176872) and/or MEK2 (MAP2K2; 601263). NTN1 also activated the
transcription factor ELK1 (311040) and serum response element-regulated
gene expression. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed interaction of
full-length DCC with MEK1/2 in the presence or absence of NTN1. Forcet
et al. (2002) showed that activation of Dcc by Ntn1 in rat embryonic
day-13 dorsal spinal cord stimulates and is required for the outgrowth
of commissural axons and Erk1/2 activation. Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated expression of activated Erk1/2 in embryonic commissural
axons, and this expression was diminished in Dcc or Ntn1 knockout
animals. Forcet et al. (2002) concluded that the MAPK pathway is
involved in responses to NTN1 and proposed that ERK activation affects
axonal growth by phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins and
neurofilaments.

Ming et al. (2002) found that axonal growth cones of cultured frog
spinal neurons exhibit adaptation during chemotactic migration,
undergoing consecutive phases of desensitization and resensitization in
the presence of increasing basal concentrations of the guidance factors
Ntn1 or Bdnf1 (113505). Ntn1- or Bdnf1-specific desensitization was
accompanied by a reduction of calcium signaling, whereas resensitization
required activation of Mapk and local protein synthesis. Ming et al.
(2002) suggested that the protracted nature of this process allows
adaptive changes in the sensitivity of the growth cone and that the
adaptive behavior exemplifies the image of the growth cone as a
chemotaking amoeba, as proposed in the 19th century by Ramon y Cajal.

Nishiyama et al. (2003) reported that the ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic
GMP activities sets the polarity of netrin-1-induced axon guidance: high
ratios favor attraction, whereas low ratios favor repulsion. Whole-cell
recordings of calcium currents in Xenopus spinal neuron growth cones
indicated that cyclic nucleotide signaling directly modulates the
activity of L-type calcium channels in axonal growth cones. Furthermore,
cyclic GMP signaling activated by an arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase
metabolite suppressed L-type calcium channel activity triggered by
netrin-1, and was required for growth cone repulsion mediated by the
DCC-UNC5 (see 603610) receptor complex. By linking cyclic AMP and cyclic
GMP signaling and modulation of calcium channel activity in growth
cones, these findings delineated an early membrane-associated event
responsible for signal transduction during bidirectional axon guidance.

Mehlen et al. (1998) showed that DCC induces apoptosis conditionally: by
functioning as a dependence receptor, DCC induces apoptosis unless it is
engaged by its ligand netrin-1. Mazelin et al. (2004) demonstrated that
inhibition of cell death by enforced expression of netrin-1 in mouse
gastrointestinal tract led to the spontaneous formation of hyperplastic
and neoplastic lesions. Moreover, in the adenomatous polyposis coli
mutant background associated with adenoma formation, enforced expression
of netrin-1 engendered aggressive adenocarcinomatous malignancies.
Mazelin et al. (2004) concluded that netrin-1 can promote intestinal
tumor development, probably by regulating cell survival. Thus, a
netrin-1 receptor or receptors function as conditional tumor
suppressors.

Blood vessels and nerves often follow with parallel trajectories,
suggesting that distal targets use common cues that induce
vascularization and innervation. Netrins are secreted by the floor plate
and attract commissural axons toward the midline of the neural tube.
Park et al. (2004) showed that netrin-1 is also a potent vascular
mitogen. Netrin-1 stimulates proliferation, induces migration, and
promotes adhesion of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells
with a specific activity comparable to vascular endothelial growth
factor (PEGF; 192240) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF; see
173430). The authors presented evidence indicating that the netrin
receptor neogenin (NEO1; 601907) mediates netrin signaling in vascular
smooth muscle cells, but suggested that an unidentified receptor
mediates the proangiogenic effects of netrin-1 on endothelial cells.
Netrin-1 also stimulates angiogenesis in vivo and augments the response
to vascular endothelial growth factor. Park et al. (2004) concluded that
netrin-1 is a secreted neural guidance cue with the unique ability to
attract both blood vessels and axons and that other cues may also
function as vascular endothelial growth factors.

Netrin proteins play a role in the developing nervous system by
promoting both axonal outgrowth and axonal guidance in pathfinding. Liu
et al. (2004), Li et al. (2004), and Ren et al. (2004) simultaneously
reported a complex network of intracellular signaling downstream from
netrin-1 involving DCC (120470), focal adhesion kinase (FAK; 600758),
and FYN (137025), a member of the SRC family kinases (see 190090). In
neurons cultured from rat cerebral cortex, Liu et al. (2004) found that
netrin-1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and FYN, and
coimmunoprecipitation studies showed direct interaction of FAK and FYN
with DCC. Inhibition of FYN inhibited FAK phosphorylation, and FYN
mutants inhibited the attractive turning responses to netrin. Neurons
lacking the FAK gene showed reduced axonal outgrowth and attractive
turning responses to netrin. In cultured neurons from chick and mouse,
Li et al. (2004) found that netrin increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
DCC and FAK. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that DCC interacted
directly with FAK and SRC to form a complex and that FAK and SRC
cooperated to stimulate DCC phosphorylation by SRC. Li et al. (2004)
suggested that phosphorylated DCC acts as a kinase-coupled receptor and
that FAK and SRC act downstream of DCC in netrin signaling. Ren et al.
(2004) found that inhibition of FAK phosphorylation inhibited
netrin-1-induced axonal outgrowth and guidance. The authors suggested
that FAK may also function as a scaffolding protein and play a role in
cytoskeletal reorganization that is necessary for neurite outgrowth and
turning.

Lu et al. (2004) showed that the repulsive netrin receptor UNC5B
(607870) is expressed by endothelial tip cells of the vascular system.
Disruption of the Unc5b gene in mice or of Unc5b or netrin-1A in
zebrafish led to aberrant extension of endothelial tip cell filopodia,
excessive vessel branching, and abnormal navigation. Netrin-1 caused
endothelial filopodial retraction, but only when Unc5b was present.
Thus, Lu et al. (2004) concluded that UNC5B functions as a repulsive
netrin receptor in endothelial cells controlling morphogenesis of the
vascular system.

Larrivee et al. (2007) found that Unc5b was downregulated in quiescent
adult mouse vasculature, but it was reexpressed during sprouting
angiogenesis in 3-dimensional gels and in tumor implants. Stimulation of
Unc5b-expressing neovessels with netrin-1 inhibited sprouting
angiogenesis, and genetic loss of Unc5b reduced netrin-1-mediated
inhibition of angiogenesis. Expression of Unc5b triggered endothelial
cell repulsion in response to netrin-1 in vitro, whereas a truncated
Unc5b lacking the intracellular signaling domain failed to induce
repulsion. Larrivee et al. (2007) concluded that activation of UNC5B by
netrin-1 inhibits sprouting angiogenesis.

Wang and Poo (2005) reported that TRP (transient receptor
potential)-like channel activity exists in the growth cones of cultured
Xenopus neurons and can be modulated by exposure to netrin-1 and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505), 2 chemoattractants for
axon guidance. Whole-cell recording from growth cones showed that
netrin-1 induced a membrane depolarization, part of which remained after
all major voltage-dependent channels were blocked. Furthermore, the
membrane depolarization was sensitive to blockers of TRP channels.
Pharmacologic blockade of putative TRP currents or downregulation of
Xenopus TRP1 (xTRPC1) expression with a specific morpholino
oligonucleotide abolished the growth cone turning and calcium ion
elevation induced by a netrin-1 gradient. Thus, Wang and Poo (2005)
concluded that TRPC currents reflect early events in the growth cone's
detection of some extracellular guidance signal, resulting in membrane
depolarization and cytoplasmic calcium ion elevation that mediates the
turning of growth cones.

Wilson et al. (2006) demonstrated that netrins stimulate proliferation,
migration, and tube formation of human endothelial cells in vitro and
that this stimulation is independent of known netrin receptors.
Suppression of netrin-1a mRNA in zebrafish inhibited vascular sprouting,
implying a proangiogenic role for netrins during vertebrate development.
Wilson et al. (2006) also showed that netrins accelerate
neovascularization in an in vivo model of ischemia and that they reverse
neuropathy and vasculopathy in a diabetic murine model. Wilson et al.
(2006) found that vectors expressing netrin-1 and netrin-4 (NTN4;
610401) are comparable in effectiveness to vectors expressing VEGF
(192240) and promoting neovascularization and reperfusion.

Colon-Ramos et al. (2007) showed that connectivity between 2
interneurons in C. elegans, AIY and RIA, is orchestrated by a pair of
glial cells that express UNC6 (netrin-1). In the postsynaptic neuron
RIA, the netrin receptor UNC40 (DCC; 120470) plays a conventional
guidance role, directing outgrowth of the RIA process ventrally toward
the glia. The authors demonstrated that in the presynaptic neuron AIY,
UNC40 plays an unexpected and theretofore uncharacterized role: it
cell-autonomously promotes assembly of presynaptic terminals in the
immediate vicinity of the glial cell endfeet. Colon-Ramos et al. (2007)
concluded that netrin can be used both for guidance and local
synaptogenesis and suggested that glial cells can function as guideposts
during the assembly of neural circuits in vivo.

Using cultured rat and frog spinal neurons, Ly et al. (2008) showed that
Dscam (602523) could mediate the turning response to netrin-1 both alone
and in collaboration with the netrin receptor Dcc.

Using primary neurons derived from rat, mouse, and chicken embryos,
Furne et al. (2008) showed that Ntn1, in addition to behaving as an
attractive cue, functioned in cell survival by inhibiting the
proapoptotic activity of Dcc.

By quantitative RT-PCR of 51 primary breast tumors, Fitamant et al.
(2008) found significantly increased expression of netrin-1 in a high
proportion of lymph node-positive tumors and tumors from metastatic
patients. Netrin-1-expressing mammary metastatic tumor cell lines
underwent apoptosis when netrin-1 expression was experimentally
decreased or when decoy soluble netrin receptor ectodomains were added.
Such treatments prevented lung metastasis of a mammary cancer cell line
and a xenografted human breast tumor in mice. Fitamant et al. (2008)
concluded that netrin-1 expression confers a selective advantage for
tumor cell survival.

Moore et al. (2009) showed that traction on immobilized netrin-1 was
sufficient to reorient axons.

Delloye-Bourgeois et al. (2009) showed that autocrine production of NTN1
conveyed a selective advantage in tumor growth and dissemination in
aggressive forms of neuroblastoma (NB; see 256700) by blocking the
proapoptotic activity of the UNC5H receptors. NTN1 upregulation appeared
to be a marker for poor prognosis in infants with stage 4S and stage 4
NB. NTN1 disruption blocked NB metastasis in animals, and
Delloye-Bourgeois et al. (2009) proposed disrupting NTN1 expression as
an anticancer strategy.

MAPPING

Meyerhardt et al. (1999) mapped the human NTN1 gene to chromosome
17p13-p12 by FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Serafini et al. (1996) used the method of Skarnes et al. (1995) in
embryonic stem cells to selectively recover mutations in genes encoding
proteins with signal sequences by virtue of creating fusions of
N-terminal portions of these proteins with an exogenous transmembrane
domain. In this way Serafini et al. (1996) isolated a mutated murine
netrin-1 gene and transmitted it through the germline. Homozygotes were
born but apparently did not suckle and died within a few days.
Netrin-1-deficient mice exhibited defects in spinal commissural axon
projections that were considered consistent with netrin-1 guiding these
axons. Defects in several forebrain commissures were also observed,
suggesting additional guidance roles for netrin-1.

Poon et al. (2008) demonstrated that the axon guidance cue unc6/netrin
and its receptor unc5 (607869) act throughout development to exclude
synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins from the dendrite of the C.
elegans motor neuron DA9, which is proximal to a source of unc6/netrin.
In unc6/netrin and unc5 loss-of-function mutants, presynatic components
mislocalized to the DA9 dendrite. In addition, ectopically expressed
unc6/netrin, acting through unc5, was sufficient to exclude endogenous
synapses from adjacent subcellular domains within the DA9 axon.
Furthermore, this antisynaptogenic activity was interchangeable with
that of lin44/Wnt despite being transduced through different receptors,
suggesting that extracellular cues such as netrin and Wnts not only
guide axon navigation but also regulate the polarized accumulation of
presynaptic components through local exclusion.

;;LBA;;
CELL DIVISION CYCLE 4-LIKE PROTEIN; CDC4L;;
CDC4-LIKE PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS1; 214500) suffer from a
systemic immunodeficiency involving defects in polarized trafficking of
vesicles in a number of immune system cell types. In mouse, this
syndrome is reproduced in strains with a mutation in the 'beige' gene
that results in proteins lacking the BEACH (beige and CHS1) domain and
C-terminal WD repeats. LRBA contains key features of both beige/CHS1 and
A kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs; see 602449).

CLONING

Using a differential screening strategy to identify chimeric cDNA clones
derived from long-terminal repeat-promoted transcripts, Feuchter et al.
(1992) obtained a partial cDNA encoding LRBA, which they termed CDC4L
due to its homology to the yeast cell division cycle gene Cdc4.

By gene trapping of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible clone, PCR of a
mouse B-lymphocyte cDNA library, 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, and searching
sequence databases, Wang et al. (2001) obtained cDNAs encoding human
LRBA and 3 isoforms of mouse Lrba. Sequence analysis predicted that the
2,856-, 2,792-, and 2,579-amino acid mouse proteins (designated alpha,
beta, and gamma, respectively) all have a WD repeat-like (WDL) domain, a
BEACH domain with an SH3-binding site, and a unique C terminus. The
alpha isoform has 5 WD repeats, while the beta isoform has 3 and the
gamma isoform lacks WD repeats. The 2,863-amino acid human LRBA protein
is 85% identical to the mouse protein, and they have homology to a
Drosophila anchor protein, Akap550. Northern blot analysis using a mouse
Lrba probe revealed that expression of a 10-kb transcript was
upregulated in LPS-induced B-cell and macrophage lines. Simultaneous
multiplex RT-PCR analysis detected variable expression of the 3 Lrba
isoforms in cell lines and mouse tissues. Fluorescent, confocal, and
immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated upregulated expression of
the BEACH-WD region of Lrba in cytosolic vesicles after LPS stimulation;
it specifically colocalized with lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus. Wang
et al. (2001) proposed that LRBA is part of a WDL-BEACH-WD (WBW) gene
family. They concluded that LRBA is constitutively associated with
protein kinase A (PKA; see 176911), which, upon LPS stimulation and
BEACH phosphorylation, binds to intracellular vesicles that are
transported to the plasma membrane.

Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) found expression of the LRBA gene in
multiple human tissues, both immune-related and nonimmune-related.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LRBA
gene to chromosome 4 (TMAP stSG9931).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 patients from 4 unrelated consanguineous families with common
variable immunodeficiency-8 with autoimmunity (CVID8; 614700),
Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified 4 different homozygous mutations
in the LRBA gene (606453.0001-606453.0004). The first mutation was found
by linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing. Heterozygous
mutation carriers were unaffected. Affected individuals had
early-childhood onset of recurrent infections, particularly respiratory
infections, and also developed variable autoimmune disorders, including
idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and
inflammatory bowel disease. Laboratory studies showed decreased numbers
of switched memory B cells, hypogammaglobulinemia, and variable other
defects. Cultured patient B cells showed a failure to proliferate,
differentiate into plasma cells, or produce antibodies under inducible
conditions. Patient cells also showed an increased susceptibility to
apoptosis, most likely due to impaired autophagy and abnormal
accumulation of cellular organelles. No LRBA mutations were found in 12
additional families with suspected autosomal recessive CVID.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 8, WITH AUTOIMMUNITY
LRBA, ILE2657SER

In 2 sibs, born of consanguineous Arab parents, with common variable
immunodeficiency syndrome-8 with autoimmunity (CVID8; 614700),
Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified a homozygous 7970T-G transversion
in exon 54 of the LRBA gene, resulting in an ile2657-to-ser (I2657S)
substitution in a highly conserved residue. Each unaffected parent and 4
unaffected sibs were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found
in 128 controls. The mutation was identified by linkage analysis
followed by candidate gene sequencing. Immunoblot analysis of patient
cells showed complete absence of the LRBA protein, suggesting that the
mutant protein was unstable. Naive B cells from the patients showed
extremely low levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody production and
lymphocyte proliferation when stimulated. Patient cells also showed
increased apoptosis under serum depletion compared to controls, and this
was associated with defects in autophagy.

.0002
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 8, WITH AUTOIMMUNITY
LRBA, ARG1683TER

In a boy, born of consanguineous Sicilian parents, with CVID8 with
autoimmunity (614700), Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 5047C-T transition in exon 30 of the LRBA gene, resulting in
an arg1683-to-ter (R1683X) substitution. No LRBA protein was detected in
patient cells. The mutation was not found in 200 control alleles. Naive
B cells from the patient showed extremely low levels of IgG production
and lymphocyte proliferation when stimulated. Patient cells also showed
increased apoptosis under serum depletion compared to controls, and this
was associated with defects in autophagy.

.0003
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 8, WITH AUTOIMMUNITY
LRBA, GLU59TER

In a boy, born of consanguineous Iranian parents, with CVID8 with
autoimmunity (614700), Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 175G-T transversion in exon 3 of the LRBA gene, resulting in
a glu59-to-ter (E59X) substitution. The mutation was not found in 233
Iranian controls. Naive B cells from the patient showed low lymphocyte
proliferation when stimulated. Patient cells showed increased areas of
Golgi apparatus and accumulation of autophagosomes, suggesting impaired
autophagy.

.0004
IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 8, WITH AUTOIMMUNITY
LRBA, 111.1-KB DEL

In a boy, born of consanguineous Iranian parents, with CVID8 with
autoimmunity (614700), Lopez-Herrera et al. (2012) identified a
homozygous 111.1-kb deletion on chromosome 4q including exons 1 and 2 of
the LRBA gene and about 60 kb upstream and 50 kb downstream of these
exons.

607189	TITLE *607189 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 8; RGS8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are regulatory and
structural components of G protein-coupled receptor complexes. RGS
proteins are GTPase-activating proteins for Gi (see GNAI1; 139310) and
Gq (see GNAQ; 600998) class G-alpha proteins. They accelerate transit
through the cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis and thereby accelerate
signaling kinetics and termination.

CLONING

Using a combination of exon trapping, cDNA library screening, and
shotgun sample sequencing, Sood et al. (2001) identified RGS8 within a
prostate cancer susceptibility region on chromosome 1 (HPC1; 601518).
They identified 2 RGS8 splice variants. The shorter variant contains
exons 3 through 7, while the longer variant lacks exon 3. The larger
transcript encodes a deduced 198-amino acid protein. Northern blot
analysis revealed a 6.5-kb transcript expressed only in brain. Dot blot
analysis of mRNA showed expression was stronger in several subregions of
the brain, particularly pons, putamen, thalamus, caudate nucleus, and
cerebellum. Low-level expression was detected in fetal brain, testis,
and thyroid gland.

Saitoh et al. (2002) cloned Rgs8 from a rat brain cDNA library and
identified 2 splice variants, one of which contains an N terminus of 7
amino acids, while the other contains an N terminus of 9 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Saitoh et al. (2002) found that the longer Rgs8 variant in rat
accelerated the cycling of Gi/Go-mediated modulation of G protein-gated
inward-rectifying K(+) channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The
longer form also decreased the amplitude of the Gq-coupled response to
activation of M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1; 118510) or substance P
receptor (TACR1; 162323), but did not inhibit signaling from the M3
muscarinic receptor (CHRM3; 118494). The shorter variant showed weakened
modulation of Gi/o- and Gq-coupled signaling in all assays.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sood et al. (2001) determined that the RGS8 gene contains 7 exons.
Sierra et al. (2002), however, determined that RGS8 contains 6 exons and
spans more than 26 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sierra et al. (2002) mapped the RGS8 gene
to chromosome 1q25.3. They mapped the mouse Rgs8 gene to chromosome 1 by
interspecific backcross mapping.

115440	TITLE *115440 CASEIN KINASE II, ALPHA-1; CSNK2A1
;;CASEIN KINASE II, ALPHA SUBUNIT; CK2A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Casein kinase II is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates acidic
protein such as casein. It has a tetrameric a(2)/b(2) structure. The
alpha subunit of molecular mass 40 kD possesses catalytic activity,
whereas the beta subunit (115441), molecular mass 25 kD, is
autophosphorylated in vitro. Meisner et al. (1989) reported the
identification and nucleotide sequencing of a complete human cDNA for
the alpha subunit. Using the full-length cDNA probe, Meisner et al.
(1989) found 2 bands with restriction enzymes that have no recognition
sites within the cDNA and 3 to 6 bands with enzymes having single
internal sites. These results were considered consistent with the
existence of 2 genes encoding alpha subunits. See 115442.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wirkner et al. (1994) demonstrated that the CSNK2A1 gene contains 8
exons whose sequences comprise bases 102 to 824 of the coding region of
the human casein kinase II alpha subunit. Three of the 9 introns are
located at positions corresponding to those of the homologous gene in
the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The introns contain 8 complete and
8 incomplete Alu repeats.

GENE FUNCTION

Phosphorylation of the human p53 protein (191170) at ser392 is
responsive to ultraviolet (UV) but not gamma irradiation. Keller et al.
(2001) identified and purified a mammalian UV-activated protein kinase
complex that phosphorylates ser392 in vitro. This kinase complex
contains CK2 and the chromatin transcriptional elongation factor FACT, a
heterodimer of SPT16 (605012) and SSRP1 (604328). In vitro studies
showed that FACT alters the specificity of CK2 in the complex such that
it selectively phosphorylates p53 over other substrates, including
casein. In addition, phosphorylation by the kinase complex was found to
enhance p53 activity. These results provided a potential mechanism for
p53 activation by UV irradiation.

Doray et al. (2002) demonstrated that the Golgi-localized,
gamma-ear-containing adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-binding
proteins (GGA1, 606004 and GGA3, 606006) and the coat protein adaptor
protein-1 (AP-1) complex (see AP1G2, 603534) colocalize in
clathrin-coated buds of the trans-Golgi networks of mouse L cells and
human HeLa cells. Binding studies revealed a direct interaction between
the hinge domains of the GGAs and the gamma-ear domain of AP-1. Further,
AP-1 contained bound casein kinase-2 that phosphorylated GGA1 and GGA3,
thereby causing autoinhibition. Doray et al. (2002) demonstrated that
this autoinhibition could induce the directed transfer of mannose
6-phosphate receptors (see 154540) from the GGAs to AP-1. Mannose
6-phosphate receptors that were defective in binding to GGAs were poorly
incorporated into adaptor protein complex containing clathrin coated
vesicles. Thus, Doray et al. (2002) concluded that GGAs and the AP-1
complex interact to package mannose 6-phosphate receptors into
AP-1-containing coated vesicles.

Lin et al. (2002) identified a Drosophila circadian mutant, Timekeeper
(Tik), that behaved in a dominant manner. Tik homozygotes do not live to
adulthood, and heterozygotes have a circadian rhythm lengthened by about
3 hours. Lin et al. (2002) showed that the catalytic subunit of
Drosophila casein kinase-2 (CK2-alpha) is expressed predominantly in the
cytoplasm of key circadian pacemaker neurons. CK2-alpha mutant flies
showed lengthened circadian period, decreased CK2 activity, and delayed
nuclear entry of Per (see 602260). Lin et al. (2002) suggested that
these are probably direct, as CK2-alpha specifically phosphorylates Per
in vitro. Lin et al. (2002) proposed that CK2 is an evolutionary link
between the divergent circadian systems of animals, plants, and fungi.

Loizou et al. (2004) showed that CK2 phosphorylates the scaffold protein
XRCC1 (194360) and thereby enables the assembly and activity of DNA
single-strand break repair protein complexes in vitro and at sites of
chromosome breakage. Inhibition of XRCC1 phosphorylation by mutation of
the CK2 phosphorylation sites or by preventing CK2 activity using a
highly specific inhibitor ablated the rapid repair of cellular DNA
single-strand breaks by XRCC1. These data identified a direct role for
CK2 in the repair of chromosome DNA strand breaks and in maintaining
genetic integrity.

Downstream core promoter elements (DPE) are regulatory sequences that
add diversity to the promoter architecture of RNA polymerase
II-transcribed genes. Despite a functional correlation between the
presence of TFIID (313650) and DPE, Lewis et al. (2005) found that TFIID
was insufficient for DPE-specific transcription in HeLa cells. Using a
functional transcription assay coupled with conventional biochemistry,
they found that protein kinase CK2, in conjunction with the coactivator
PC4 (600503), established DPE-specific transcription.

MAPPING

By segregation analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids and
chromosomal in situ hybridization, Yang-Feng et al. (1991) identified 2
loci for the alpha subunit of casein kinase II: 11p15.5-p.15.4 and
20p13. Whether one of these is a pseudogene remained to be determined.
Boldyreff et al. (1992) likewise found 2 assignments by in situ
hybridization: 11pter-p15.1 and 20p13. Only the locus on chromosome 11
was confirmed by somatic cell hybrid analysis, based on the presence of
a CK2A1-specific 20-kb fragment. However, Wirkner et al. (1992)
demonstrated that the sequence that maps to 11p15 by in situ
hybridization has the characteristics of a processed pseudogene.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization using an 18.9-kb genomic clone
representing the central portion of the gene, Wirkner et al. (1994)
mapped CSNK2A1 to 20p13. Using the genomic clone, no hybridization
signal was obtained in 11p15 as had previously been the case when the
cDNA was used as probe (Yang-Feng et al., 1991).

similarity with the mouse Azi1 protein and with the troponin family (see
191041). RT-PCR ELISA detected highest AZI1 expression in spinal cord,
followed by testis, ovary, amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus. Lower
expression was detected in all other adult and fetal tissues and
specific adult brain regions examined.

Aoto et al. (1995) cloned mouse Az1 from a testis cDNA library. The
deduced 947-amino acid protein has 2 proline-rich regions in its
N-terminal half, 5 potential N-glycosylation sites, and several putative
nuclear targeting sequences. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.7-kb
transcript in all mouse tissues examined, with highest expression in
testis, followed by ovary, brain, and adipose tissue. In mouse testis,
expression began in pachytene spermatocytes beginning at 16 days of age,
when meiosis occurs. Testis of jsd/jsd mice, in which germ cells are
arrested in an early stage of spermatogenesis, did not express Az1.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Az1 expression in the preacrosome
region of round and elongated spermatids in seminiferous tubules, but
not in more differentiated spermatids.

GENE FUNCTION

Aoto et al. (1995) found that the expression of Az1 was induced by
5-azacytidine, a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (see 126375)
that causes differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mouse mesenchymal cells into
chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myotubes, or induces transformation.

MAPPING

By analyzing a human-rodent hybrid panel, Kikuno et al. (1999) mapped
the AZI1 gene to chromosome 17. Gross (2011) mapped the AZI1 gene to
chromosome 17q25.3 based on an alignment of the AZI1 sequence (GenBank
GENBANK BC136578) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;BREAST BASIC CONSERVED GENE 1; BBC1;;
D16S444E
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Adams et al. (1992) identified a novel cDNA representing an mRNA showing
significantly higher levels of expression in benign breast lesions than
in carcinomas. In both tissues, expression was highest in epithelial
cells, as determined by in situ hybridization to tissue sections. The
protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence was highly basic with no
signal or transmembrane sequence, but 2 potential nuclear localization
signals. The cDNA hybridized to multiple sequences within both human and
other mammalian genomes and to single genomic sequences in Drosophila,
Physarum, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Thus the cDNA represents a
highly conserved gene sequence. Only 1 major transcript was identified
in human cells, but the existence of several pseudogenes was suspected.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Kenmochi et al.
(1998) mapped the RPL13 gene to chromosome 16.

609557	TITLE *609557 PROLYL ENDOPEPTIDASE-LIKE; PREPL
;;KIAA0436
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PREPL belongs to the prolyl oligopeptidase subfamily of serine
peptidases (Parvari et al., 2005).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1997) cloned PREPL, which they designated
KIAA0436. The deduced 689-amino acid protein had an apparent molecular
mass of 72 kD by SDS-PAGE. RT-PCR detected high expression in all
tissues examined except spleen, where expression was low.

Parvari et al. (2001) identified PREPL as one of the genes affected by a
homozygous deletion of 179 kb on chromosome 2, which results in the 2p21
deletion syndrome (606407). By EST database analysis, Parvari et al.
(2005) identified 9 PREPL splice variants predicted to produce 4
different proteins. The longest deduced protein contains 727 amino acids
and has a propeller domain in its N-terminal half and a catalytic
domain, including the catalytic triad (ser, asp, his) essential for
serine peptidases, in its C-terminal half. EST database analysis and
RT-PCR showed tissue-specific expression of each PREPL variant.

GENE FUNCTION

PREPL is localized in the cytosol and shows homology with prolyl
endopeptidase (PREP; 600400) and oligopeptidase B (EC 3.4.21.83). Jaeken
et al. (2006) found that substitution of the predicted catalytic
residues (ser470, asp556, and his601) by alanines resulted in loss of
reactivity with a serine hydrolase-specific probe. In sharp contrast to
PREP and oligopeptidase B, which require both amino- and
carboxy-terminal sequences for activity, PREPL activity appeared to
depend only on the carboxy-terminal domain. Jaeken et al. (2006)
concluded that PREPL is a novel oligopeptidase with unique structural
and functional characteristics.

GENE STRUCTURE

Parvari et al. (2005) determined that the PREPL gene contains 14 coding
exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1997) mapped the PREPL
gene to chromosome 2.

By genomic sequence analysis, Parvari et al. (2001) mapped the PREPL
gene to chromosome 2p16. Parvari et al. (2005) refined the mapping to
chromosome 2p21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Parvari et al. (2001, 2005) identified PREPL as one of the genes deleted
in the homozygous 2p21 deletion syndrome (606407).

Jaeken et al. (2006) studied 11 patients with the hypotonia-cystinuria
syndrome, also known as the 2p21 deletion syndrome. They found
microdeletion of part of the SLC3A1 (104614) and PREPL genes on 2p21.
Since loss-of-function mutations in SLC3A1 were known to cause isolated
cystinuria type I (220100), and since the expression of the flanking
genes, C2orf34 (609559) and PPM1B (603770), was normal, the extended
phenotype could be attributed to deletion of PREPL.

185630	TITLE *185630 SURFEIT 2; SURF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Surf2 cDNA to screen placenta and HeLa cell cDNA libraries,
followed by database analysis and 3-prime RACE of a HeLa cDNA library,
Lennard et al. (1994) cloned human SURF2. The deduced 256-amino acid
protein shares 69% identity with mouse Surf2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lennard et al. (1994) found that the major start sites of the SURF1
(185620) and SURF2 genes are separated by 97 bp, although both genes
have multiple transcription start sites. The intergenic region is
expected to have bidirectional promoter activity, as is found in mouse.
This region lacks a TATA box, but is GC-rich. DNase footprint analysis
showed 4 regions that interacted with HeLa cell nuclear factor
complexes.

Duhig et al. (1998) stated that the 5-prime end of each of the surfeit
genes, including SURF2, is contained within a CpG island. Although the
mouse Surf2 and Surf4 (185660) genes overlap at their 3-prime ends,
human SURF2 and SURF4 are separated by 302 bp due to a much shorter
3-prime UTR in the human SURF2 gene.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Yon et al. (1993) mapped the SURF2 gene within the surfeit
gene cluster on chromosome 9q34. They stated that the mouse surfeit gene
cluster maps to the proximal portion of chromosome 2.

Duhig et al. (1998) determined that the human surfeit gene cluster spans
60 kb on chromosome 9q34.

613293	TITLE *613293 SH3 AND PX DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2B; SH3PXD2B
;;TYROSINE KINASE SUBSTRATE WITH 4 SH3 DOMAINS; TKS4;;
KIAA1295
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) obtained a partial SH3PXD2B clone, which
they designated KIAA1295. The transcript contains repetitive elements in
its 3-prime end, and the deduced protein contains putative SH3 domains.
RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in ovary, followed by testis,
liver, adult and fetal brain, and all specific adult brain regions
examined. Lower expression was detected in adult heart and lung and
fetal liver, and little to no expression was detected in skeletal
muscle, kidney, pancreas, and spleen.

Using PCR, Buschman et al. (2009) cloned full-length SH3PXD2B, which
they called TKS4, from mouse fibroblast and human brain cDNA libraries.
The deduced human SH3PXD2B protein contains 911 amino acids and has a
calculated molecular mass of 101.6 kD. It has an N-terminal Phox
homology (PX) domain, 4 SRC (190090) homology-3 (SH3) domains, numerous
PxxP motifs, and 3 putative tyrosine phosphorylation motifs.
Quantitative PCR analysis detected highest expression in mouse embryo
samples, with lower and variable expression in all adult mouse tissues
examined.

Mao et al. (2009) noted that the deduced 908-amino acid mouse Sh3pxd2b
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 102 kD and contains an
N-terminal PX domain and 4 SH3 domains. Endogenous Sh3pxd2b localized to
the cytoplasm of mouse fibroblasts, with concentration at podosome
clusters and rosettes. Western blot analysis detected variable
expression of Sh3pxd2b at an apparent molecular mass of 120 kD, with
highest expression in brain, lung, spleen, and stomach, but no
expression in kidney or bone marrow.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Buschman et al. (2009) mapped the human
and mouse SH3PXD2B genes to chromosomes 5 and 11, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Buschman et al. (2009) showed that the isolated PX domain of TKS4 bound
phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and PtdIns3P. It
also bound more weakly to phosphatidic acid. Knockdown or knockout of
Tks4 in mouse fibroblasts resulted in cells unable to form pseudopods
and with an inhibited ability to degrade a gelatin film, which was due
to reduced pseudopod recruitment of membrane type-1 matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP14; 600754). These functions were rescued by
reintroduction of wildtype Tks4, but not by Tks4 with mutations at the
putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites.

Using a protein pull-down assay, Mao et al. (2009) found that the fourth
SH3 domain of mouse Sh3pxd2b interacted with Adam15 (605548), a
metalloprotease involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Mao et al.
(2009) hypothesized that Sh3pxd2b may function as an adaptor protein
involved in targeting of Adam15 to podosomes for extracellular matrix
remodeling.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Lebanese family of Syrian origin with Frank-ter Haar syndrome
(FTHS; 249420), originally reported by Megarbane et al. (1997), Iqbal et
al. (2010) analyzed SNP array data for copy number variation and
identified a homozygous deletion on chromosome 5q in affected
individuals. The smallest interval overlapping a region of shared
homozygosity identified with other FTHS families contained only the
SH3PXD2B gene. Iqbal et al. (2010) screened SH3PXD2B in probands from 12
FTHS families and identified 4 homozygous mutations in 6 families
(613293.0001-613293.0004).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mao et al. (2009) found that mice homozygous for the spontaneous nee
mutation had a normal life span, but they exhibited runted growth,
craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities, ocular anterior segment
dysgenesis, and hearing impairment. Adults also exhibited infertility
and a form of lipodystrophy depleting white adipose tissue. Mao et al.
(2009) identified the nee mutation as a 1-bp deletion in the Sh3pxd2b
gene that was predicted to cause a frameshift and protein truncation,
altering a portion of the third SH3 domain and deleting all of the
fourth SH3 domain. Unlike wildtype Sh3pxd2b, mutant Sh3pxd2b localized
within the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm.

Iqbal et al. (2010) used a gene-trap strategy to generate Sh3pxd2b-null
mice and observed pronounced skeletal, eye, and cardiac abnormalities
that phenocopied the majority of the defects associated with Frank-ter
Haar syndrome (249420).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FRANK-TER HAAR SYNDROME
SH3PXD2B, 1-BP INS, 147T

In 2 Dutch families with Frank-ter Haar syndrome (249420), including the
family originally described by ter Haar et al. (1982), Iqbal et al.
(2010) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (147insT) in the
SH3PXD2B gene, predicted to create an immediate stop at that codon
(phe49-to-ter; F49X) within the phox homology (PX) domain. The
unaffected parents from both families were heterozygous carriers of the
mutation, which was not found in at least 50 controls. Immunoblot
analysis showed no TKS4 signal in patient fibroblasts, demonstrating
that Frank-ter Haar syndrome can be caused by homozygous
loss-of-function mutations of SH3PXD2B. Quantitative PCR analysis in
patient fibroblasts showed normal levels of SH3PXD2B transcript, even
though no TKS4 protein was detected, indicating that the premature stop
codon likely results in a truncated unstable protein.

.0002
FRANK-TER HAAR SYNDROME
SH3PXD2B, 1-BP DEL, 969G

In the Turkish family originally reported by Maas et al. (2004) and
another family of Arabic origin with Frank-ter Haar syndrome (249420),
Iqbal et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion
(969delG) in the SH3PXD2B gene, predicted to cause a frameshift followed
by a premature stop codon. The unaffected parents from both families
were heterozygous carriers of the mutation, which was not found in at
least 50 controls.

.0003
FRANK-TER HAAR SYNDROME
SH3PXD2B, ARG43TRP

In a male Turkish patient with Frank-ter Haar syndrome (249420), Iqbal
et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 129C-T transition in the
SH3PXD2B gene, resulting in an arg43-to-trp (R43W) substitution at a
highly conserved residue within the phox homology (PX) domain that was
predicted to abolish binding to phosphoinositides. The unaffected
parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 210
control chromosomes.

.0004
FRANK-TER HAAR SYNDROME
SH3PXD2B, 76, A-C, -2

In a male Israeli patient with Frank-ter Haar syndrome (249420), Iqbal
et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 76-2A-C splice site mutation
in the SH3PXD2B gene, disrupting the strictly conserved adenosine of the
splice acceptor site. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 210 control chromosomes.

603750	TITLE *603750 AQUAPORIN 8; AQP8
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Aquaporins (AQPs) are water channels that are important for the
transport of water through high water-permeable membranes. The aquaporin
family has been divided into 2 groups based on sequence and function.
The first group is water-selective and includes AQP2 (107777) and AQP4
(600308), and the second group is permeable to both water and small
molecules and includes AQP3 (600170) and AQP7 (602974). Using a rat Aqp8
cDNA, Koyama et al. (1998) cloned human AQP8 genomic DNA. They isolated
human testis AQP8 cDNAs using the AQP8 genomic sequence. The predicted
261-amino acid AQP8 protein contains 6 membrane-spanning domains, 2
highly conserved asn-pro-ala (NPA) motifs, and 3 N-linked glycosylation
sites. The human AQP8 protein is 40.4% identical to the plant water
channel gamma-TIP, 76.0% identical to mouse Aqp8, 74.9% identical to rat
Aqp8, 29.5% identical to human AQP2, and 28.9% identical to human AQP3.
Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected a 1.35-kb AQP8 mRNA
only in pancreas and colon. Koyama et al. (1998) demonstrated that human
AQP8 is permeable to water but not to urea or glycerol. They suggested
that AQP8 is a member of a third group of aquaporins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koyama et al. (1998) determined that, like the genes of
non-water-selective aquaporins, the AQP8 gene contains 6 exons; however,
its exon-intron boundaries are different from the boundaries of those
other aquaporin genes.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Viggiano et al. (1999) mapped
the AQP8 gene to chromosome 16p12. They mapped the mouse ortholog to
chromosome 7F3 in a region showing conserved synteny with human
16p12-p11.2.

600960	TITLE *600960 SET TRANSLOCATION, MYELOID LEUKEMIA-ASSOCIATED; SET
;;INHIBITOR OF GZMA-ACTIVATED DNase; IGAAD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The translocation (6;9)(p23q34) is the hallmark of a specific subtype of
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by a poor prognosis and a
young age of onset. It is classified in the French-American-British
(FAB) system mostly as M2/M4 and rarely as M1 or refractive anemia with
excess of blast cells (RAEB). On chromosome 9, breakpoints take place in
a specific intron, denoted icb-9, of a large gene named Cain (CAN;
114350). On chromosome 6, breakpoints occur in a single intron, icb-6,
of a gene named DEK (125264). In a patient with acute undifferentiated
leukemia and an apparently normal karyotype, von Lindern et al. (1992)
found a breakpoint in icb-9 of the CAN gene in a bone marrow sample but
detected no breakpoint in DEK. They isolated and characterized a novel
gene, named SET (suppressor of variegation, enhancer of zeste, and
Trithorax), that was fused to CAN in the leukemic cells of this patient.
A chimeric SET-CAN transcript whose sequence predicted a fusion protein
of 155 kD was detected. The SET gene encodes transcripts of 2.0 and 2.7
kb that result from the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Both
transcripts contained the open reading frame for a putative protein with
a predicted molecular mass of 32 kD. The SET sequence showed homology
with the yeast nucleosome assembly protein NAP-I. The only common
sequence motif of SET and DEK proteins is an acidic region. SET has a
long acidic tail, of which a large part is present in the predicted
SET-CAN fusion protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Carlson et al. (1998) studied the role of SET in the regulation of renal
cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The mRNA encoding SET was
expressed at much higher levels in transformed human and rodent cell
lines than in cultured renal epithelial and primary endothelial cells.
Consistent with a role for SET in cell proliferation, SET mRNA
expression was markedly reduced in cells rendered quiescent by serum
starvation, contact inhibition, or differentiation. Previous findings
during renal development were extended by demonstrating that SET protein
expression is also much greater in developing rat and human kidney than
in fully differentiated, mature kidney. Finally, high levels of SET mRNA
and SET protein expression were found in Wilms tumor but not in renal
cell carcinoma, adult polycystic kidney disease, or in transitional cell
carcinoma. The SET domain (Tschiersch et al., 1994) is found in proteins
that are involved in embryonic development (Tripoulas et al., 1996).

Granzyme A (GZMA; 140050) induces a caspase-independent cell death
pathway characterized by single-stranded DNA nicks and other features of
apoptosis. A GZMA-activated DNase (GAAD) is in an endoplasmic
reticulum-associated complex containing pp32 (600832) and the GZMA
substrates SET, HMG2 (163906), and APE1 (107748). Fan et al. (2003)
showed that GAAD is NM23H1 (156490), a nucleoside diphosphate kinase
implicated in suppression of tumor metastasis, and its specific
inhibitor (IGAAD) is SET. NM23H1 bound SET and was released from
inhibition by GZMA cleavage of SET. After GZMA loading or cytotoxic T
lymphocyte attack, SET and NM23H1 translocated to the nucleus and SET
was degraded, allowing NM23H1 to nick chromosomal DNA. GZMA-treated
cells with silenced NM23H1 expression were resistant to GZMA-mediated
DNA damage and cytolysis, while cells overexpressing NM23H1 were more
sensitive.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis using the N-terminal 277 amino acids of SET
as bait, Minakuchi et al. (2001) identified SET-binding protein-1
(SETBP1; 611060). Deletion and mutagenesis analysis revealed that amino
acids 182 to 223 of SET interacted with amino acids 1238 to 1434 of
SETBP1. Immunoprecipitation analysis verified that SETBP1 interacted
with endogenous SET in a human osteosarcoma cell line.

Ischemia and seizure cause excessive neuronal excitation that is
associated with brain acidosis and neuronal cell death. Liu et al.
(2008) found that the neurotoxin kainic acid activated lysosomal
asparagine endopeptidase (AEP, or LGMN; 602620) in mouse brain and
triggered degradation of Set, followed by DNA nicking and neuronal cell
death. Pike-L (CENTG1; 605476) strongly bound Set in the nucleus and
protected Set from proteolytic cleavage by Aep in vitro and in vivo,
thereby diminishing DNA damage and neuronal cell death. Kainic acid or
stroke failed to provoke DNA nicking and neuronal cell death in
Aep-deficient mice.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, von Lindern et al. (1992)
assigned the SET gene to 9q34, centromeric of ABL (189980).

603873	TITLE *603873 PHOSPHOLIPASE A2-ACTIVATING PROTEIN; PLAA
;;PLAP
DESCRIPTION Phospholipase A2-activating protein (PLAP) is potentially important in
regulating the inflammatory response through its activation of
phospholipase A2 (e.g., 600522), which catalyzes the release of
arachidonic acid. By screening a human monocyte cDNA library with a
mouse Plap cDNA, Chopra et al. (1999) isolated human PLAP cDNAs. The
738-amino acid human PLAP protein predicted by the cDNA sequence has a
molecular mass of 80,826 kD; however, immunoblot analysis using
antibodies against PLAP detected a 72- to 74-kD protein in human
monocyte cell lysates. In mouse macrophages, an antisense Plap
oligonucleotide blocked cholera toxin-induced arachidonic acid release,
indicating a role for PLAP in the regulation of phospholipase A2
activation.

608604	TITLE *608604 RETINOL-BINDING PROTEIN 7; RBP7
;;CELLULAR RETINOL-BINDING PROTEIN 4; CRBP4;;
CRBPIV
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Due to its chemical instability and low solubility in aqueous solution,
vitamin A requires cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs), such as
RBP7, for stability, internalization, intercellular transfer,
homeostasis, and metabolism.

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to CRBPs, Folli et
al. (2002) identified a full-length cDNA encoding RBP7, which they
called CRBPIV, from a lung carcinoma cDNA library. The deduced 134-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 15.5 kD. CRBPIV shares
57%, 58%, and 49% amino acid identity with CRBPI (RBP1; 180260), CRBPII
(RBP2; 180280), and CRBPIII (RBP5; 611866), respectively. RNA dot-blot
analysis detected CRBPIV in nearly all tissues and cell lines examined,
with highest abundance in adult kidney, followed by heart, transverse
colon, fetal heart, fetal spleen, lymph node, appendix, and ascending
colon.

GENE FUNCTION

Folli et al. (2002) demonstrated that recombinant CRBPIV bound
all-trans-retinol. CRBPIV showed a lower binding affinity for retinol
than those shown by other CRBPs, and the binding stoichiometry suggested
that about 0.5 retinol-binding sites were utilized per CRBPIV molecule.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Folli et al. (2002) determined the crystal structure of apo-CRBPIV to
2-angstrom resolution and found that the structure of CRBPIV was similar
to those of other CRBPs. The absorption spectrum of all-trans-retinol
bound to CRBPIV, however, was distinct from those of retinol bound to
other CRBPs, suggesting a different mode of vitamin binding.

GENE STRUCTURE

Folli et al. (2002) determined that the RBP7 gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

Folli et al. (2002) stated that the RBP7 gene maps to chromosome 1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Piantedosi et al. (2005) generated Rbp7-null mice that were viable and
healthy, but displayed impaired retinoid incorporation into milk during
lactation. They suggested that mouse Rbp7 plays a role in retinol
metabolism in the mammary gland.

612548	TITLE *612548 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 50; TRIM50
;;TRIM50A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching EST databases for sequences mapping to the region of
chromosome 7 deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050), followed
by 5-prime RACE, Micale et al. (2008) cloned TRIM50. The deduced
487-amino acid protein has an N-terminal RING domain, followed by a
B-box type-2 domain, a coiled-coil region, and an RFP (TRIM27;
602165)-like/B30.2 domain. Micale et al. (2008) also cloned mouse
Trim50, which encodes a protein 88% identical to human TRIM50. Northern
blot analysis of several mouse tissues detected high Trim50 expression
in stomach, much weaker expression in testis, and little to no
expression in other tissues examined. Ectopically expressed mouse Trim50
localized to discrete cytoplasmic foci that partly colocalized with
peroxisomes. Expression and mutation analyses revealed that the RING and
RFP domains of Trim50 include nuclear localization and export signals,
respectively. Crosslinking experiments showed Trim50 trimerized to form
a complex of about 250 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

Micale et al. (2008) found that mouse Trim50 interacted with E2
ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and autoubiquitinated following expression
in HEK293 cells. Immunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses showed
that Trim50 interacted preferentially with the E2 enzymes Ubch8 (UBE2L6;
603890), Ubch6 (UBE2E1; 602916), and Ubch9 (UBE2E3; 604151). Mutation
analysis showed that the RING domain of Trim50 was necessary and
sufficient for binding to E2 enzymes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Micale et al. (2008) determined that the TRIM50 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Micale et al. (2008) mapped the TRIM50
gene to chromosome 7q11.23 within the interval deleted in WBS. They
mapped the mouse Trim50 gene to a syntenic region of chromosome 5G1.

142370	TITLE *142370 HEMOPOIETIC CELL KINASE; HCK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HCK is an SRC (190090) family tyrosine kinase that is expressed
predominantly in granulocytic and monocytic cells. It has proposed
functional roles in phagocytosis and receptor-mediated signaling
(summary by Scott et al., 2002).

CLONING

During a search for a cDNA clone representing human SRC (190090),
Quintrell et al. (1987) encountered a previously unrecognized gene that
appeared to encode a protein-tyrosine kinase similar to SRC. Ziegler et
al. (1987) found the same gene by a different route. Expression of this
gene may be limited to certain hemopoietic cells and is especially
prominent in cells of myeloid lineage, particularly mature granulocytes
and monocytes. Therefore, Quintrell et al. (1987) designated the gene
HCK (pronounced 'hick') for hemopoietic cell kinase. They described the
nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone representing most or all of the mRNA
for HCK, the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by HCK,
and the distribution of RNA transcribed from HCK among various
hemopoietic cells. The deduced HCK protein contains 505 amino acids and
has a calculated molecular mass of about 57 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mass spectrometric analysis, Scott et al. (2002) identified 25
potential binding partners in a human monocyte cell line for the SH3
domain of HCK. Analysis with purified proteins and in intact cells
confirmed the interactions with WIP (WIPF1; 602357), WASP (WAS; 300392),
and ELMO1 (606420). ELMO1 was heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in cells
coexpressing HCK and ELMO1, suggesting that ELMO1 is a HCK substrate.
Pull-down analysis showed that binding of ELMO1 to the HCK SH3 domain
could be inhibited by polyproline peptides, indicating that an ELMO1
polyproline motif interacts with HCK. Scott et al. (2002) concluded that
WIP, WASP, and ELMO1 may be activators or effectors of HCK.

MAPPING

By spot-blot analysis of sorted chromosomes and by in situ
hybridization, Quintrell et al. (1987) assigned the HCK gene to
chromosome 20q11-q12. Since this region is affected by interstitial
deletions in some acute myeloid leukemias and myeloproliferative
disorders, they suggested that damage to HCK may contribute to the
pathogenesis of these conditions.

607929	TITLE *607929 CCM2 GENE; CCM2
;;MALCAVERNIN;;
CHROMOSOME 7 OPEN READING FRAME 22; C7ORF22;;
OSMOSENSING SCAFFOLD FOR MEKK3; OSM
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CCM complex, which includes CCM1 (KRIT1; 604214), CCM2, and CCM3
(PDCD10; 609118), is associated with cytoskeletal elements, signal
transduction components, and cell junctions (Hogan et al., 2008).

CLONING

In a study of cerebral cavernous malformations type 2 (603284), Liquori
et al. (2003) performed mutational analysis on a positional candidate
gene, MGC4607 (CCM2), located in the critical linkage region in the UCSC
human genome assembly. The gene was chosen because its translation
product contains a putative PTP domain. The same domain had been found
in ICAP1-alpha (607153), a binding partner of the CCM1 product KRIT1
(604214), which is mutant in cerebral cavernous malformations type 1
(116860).

Liquori et al. (2003) named the novel protein encoded by the CCM2 gene
malcavernin. They suggested that it may be part of the complex pathway
of integrin signaling that, when perturbed, causes abnormal vascular
morphogenesis in the brain, leading to CCM formation. Liquori et al.
(2003) found, from Northern blot analysis of human tissues, using the
entire cDNA as a probe, that MCG4607 is most highly expressed in
skeletal muscle, heart, and liver, with minimal or no expression in the
colon and lung. MGC4607 is also expressed in the brain.

Using Western blot analysis, Uhlik et al. (2003) found that CCM2, which
they called OSM, was expressed in the majority of mouse and human cell
types tested. Northern blot and in situ hybridization of mouse tissues
showed highest Osm expression in nervous system and lymphoid tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Liquori et al. (2003) determined that the CCM2 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 77.6 kb. It contains LINE and SINE elements, including Alu
sequences, within intron 1 and the 3-prime region distal to exon 10.

MAPPING

By linkage analysis, Craig et al. (1998) mapped the CCM2 gene to
chromosome 7p15-p13.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse T-cell cDNA library, Uhlik et al.
(2003) showed that a C-terminal fragment of mouse Osm interacted with
Mekk3 (MAP3K3; 602539), a p38 (MAPK14; 600289) activator that responds
to sorbitol-induced hyperosmotic conditions. Mekk3 and Osm colocalized
in the cytoplasmic compartment of cotransfected cells, and the Mekk3-Osm
complex was recruited to Rac1 (602048)- and cytoskeletal actin (see
102560)-containing membrane ruffles in response to sorbitol treatment.
Protein interaction assays showed that Osm interacted directly with the
Mekk3 substrate Mkk3 (MAP2K3; 602315), with actin, and with both GDP-
and GTP-loaded Rac1. Uhlik et al. (2003) concluded that the
RAC1-OSM-MEKK3-MKK3 complex is required for regulation of p38 activity
in response to osmotic shock.

Zawistowski et al. (2005) used coimmunoprecipitation, fluorescence
resonance energy transfer, and subcellular localization strategies to
show that KRIT1 interacted with CCM2. Analogous to the established
interactions of KRIT1/ITGB1 (135630) and KRIT1/ICAP1, the KRIT1/CCM2
association was dependent upon phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of
CCM2. A familial CCM2 L198R mutation (607929.0007) abrogated the
KRIT1/CCM2 interaction, suggesting that loss of this interaction may be
critical in CCM pathogenesis. CCM2 and ICAP1, when bound to KRIT1 via
their respective PTB domains, differentially influenced KRIT1
subcellular localization. The authors expanded upon the established
involvement of CCM2 in the p38 MAPK signaling module by demonstrating
that KRIT1 associated with CCM2 and MEKK3 in a ternary complex.
Zawistowski et al. (2005) proposed that the genetic heterogeneity
observed in familial CCM may reflect mutation of different molecular
members of a coordinated signaling complex.

By GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Voss et al. (2007)
demonstrated that CCM2 coprecipitated and colocalized with CCM3 (PDCD10;
609118). Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that CCM3 directly bound to
STK25 (602255) and the phosphatase domain of FAP1 (600267). CCM3 was
phosphorylated by STK25, whereas the C-terminal domain of FAP1
dephosphorylated CCM3. Further experiments showed that STK25 and CCM2
formed a protein complex. The findings linked CCM3 and STK25 with CCM2,
which is part of signaling pathways that are essential for vascular
development. Voss et al. (2007) hypothesized that CCM3 is part of the
KRIT1/CCM2 protein complex through its interaction with CCM2, and
therefore may participate in CCM1-dependent modulation of ITGB1
signaling.

Using RNA interference, Crose et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of
Ccm2 in mouse brain endothelial cells led to increased monolayer
permeability, decreased tubule formation, and reduced cell migration
following wounding. These effects were associated with elevated levels
of RhoA (165390), a small GTPase necessary for cytoskeletal turnover and
migration. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that both Ccm2 and
Mekk3 directly bound the RhoA ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 (605568). Domain
analysis revealed that the PTB domain of Ccm2 directly bound the HECT
domain of Smurf1, and the interaction targeted Smurf1 to Ccm2 complexes
localized primarily at the cell periphery. Coexpression of Ccm2 and
Smurf1 led to cell rounding, likely due to loss of RhoA. Crose et al.
(2009) concluded that CCM2 contributes to endothelial cell integrity by
regulating SMURF1-directed RHOA degradation

Kleaveland et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of CCM2 in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via small hairpin RNA had no
effect on cell size, proliferation, migration, or formation of branching
structures. However, branched cords formed by CCM2-knockdown HUVECs
often lacked visible lumens, suggesting a defect in endothelial tube
formation. Using mice and zebrafish lacking Ccm2 and/or Heg1 (614182)
and CCM2-knockdown HUVECs, Kleaveland et al. (2009) showed that
CCM2-HEG1 signaling regulated endothelial tube formation and endothelial
junction formation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and pull-down
assays in transfected HEK293T cells suggested a model in which HEG1
coupled with CCM2 primarily through interaction with KRIT1 at
endothelial cell-cell junctions.

Borikova et al. (2010) showed that knockdown of Ccm1, Ccm2, or Ccm3 in
mouse embryonic endothelial cells induced RhoA overexpression and
persistent RhoA activity at the cell edge, as well as in the cytoplasm
and nucleus. RhoA activation was especially pronounced following Ccm1
knockdown. Knockdown of Ccm1, Ccm2, or Ccm3 inhibited formation of
vessel-like tubes and invasion of extracellular matrix. Knockdown or
inhibition of Rock2 countered these effects and was associated with
inhibition of RhoA-stimulated phosphorylation of myosin light chain-2
(MLC2; see 160781). Borikova et al. (2010) concluded that the CCM
protein complex regulates RhoA activation and cytoskeletal dynamics.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Liquori et al. (2003) screened a cohort of 37 probands with cerebral
cavernous malformations for KRIT1 mutations and found mutations of this
gene in 10. Among the panel of 27 probands without a KRIT1 mutation,
they detected 8 different mutations in MGC4607. One mutation, a 4-bp
deletion (607929.0004), was found in 2 separate families which, as
suggested by a further investigation into ethnic background, may be
distantly related.

Denier et al. (2004) likewise identified the MGC4607 gene as the CCM2
gene. They narrowed the CCM2 linkage interval from 22 cM to 7.5 cM. They
then hypothesized that large deletions might be involved in the
disorder, as already reported in other hamartomatous conditions such as
tuberous sclerosis (191100) and neurofibromatosis (162200). They
performed a high density microsatellite genotyping of this 7.5-cM
interval in search of putative null alleles in 30 unrelated families. In
this way, they identified, in 2 families, null alleles that were the
result of deletions within a 350-kb interval. Additional microsatellite
and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping showed that these 2
distinct deletions overlapped and that both of them deleted the first
exon of MGC4607. In both families, 1 of the 2 MGC4607 transcripts was
not detected. They then identified 8 additional point mutations within
MGC4607 in 8 of the remaining families. One of them led to the
alteration of the initiation codon and 5 of them to a premature
termination, including 1 nonsense, 1 frameshift, and 3 splice-site
mutations. The findings in cerebral cavernous malformations strongly
suggest that MGC4607 has a role in vascular morphogenesis.

Liquori et al. (2007) commented that DNA sequence analysis of the genes
CCM1 (KRIT1), CCM2, and CCM3 (PDCD10) in a cohort of 63 CCM-affected
families showed that 40% of these lacked any identifiable mutation. The
data suggested either that another CCM gene exists or that a significant
fraction of CCM mutations are not found by routine DNA sequence
analysis. Potential mutations that would be undetected by sequence
analysis included mutations within regulatory regions not included in
routine sequencing, as well as larger genomic insertions, deletions, or
duplications. Liquori et al. (2007) used multiplex ligation-dependent
probe analysis to screen 25 probands who were negative for CCM1, -2, and
-3 mutations for potential deletions or duplications within these 3
genes. They identified 15 deletions: 1 in the CCM1 gene, none in the
CCM3 gene, and 14 in the CCM2 gene. In this cohort, mutation screening
that included sequence and deletion analyses gave disease-gene
frequencies of 40% for CCM1, 38% for CCM2, 6% for CCM3, and 16% with no
mutation detected. The data indicated that the prevalence of CCM2 is
much higher than previously predicted, nearly equal to CCM1, and that
large genomic deletions in the CCM2 gene represent a major component of
this disorder. A common 77.6-kb deletion spanning CCM2 exons 2 through
10 was identified, which was present in 13% of the entire CCM cohort
(607929.0008). Liquori et al. (2007) hypothesized that these deletions
occurred in a hypermutable region because of surrounding repetitive
sequence elements and may catalyze the formation of intragenic
deletions.

In 2 (14%) of 14 unrelated patients with sporadic CCM and multiple
lesions, Felbor et al. (2007) identified a respective deletion in the
CCM2 gene using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. One of
the deletions involved the entire coding region of the CCM2 gene.

Among 24 Italian families with CCM, Liquori et al. (2008) identified 4
deletions and 1 duplication in the CCM2 gene.

For each of the 3 CCM genes, Pagenstecher et al. (2009) showed complete
localized loss of either KRIT1, CCM2/malcavernin, or PDCD10 protein
expression depending on the respective inherited mutation. Cavernous but
not adjacent normal or reactive endothelial cells of known germline
mutation carriers displayed immunohistochemical negativity only for the
corresponding CCM protein, but stained positively for the 2 other
proteins. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated endothelial cell
mosaicism as neoangiogenic vessels within caverns from a CCM1 patient,
normal brain endothelium from a CCM2 patient, and capillary endothelial
cells of vessels in a revascularized thrombosed cavern from a CCM3
patient stained positively for KRIT1, CCM2/malcavernin, and PDCD10
respectively. Pagenstecher et al. (2009) suggested that complete lack of
CCM protein in affected endothelial cells from CCM germline mutation
carriers supports a 2-hit mechanism for CCM formation.

Through repeated cycles of amplification, subcloning, and sequencing of
multiple clones per amplicon, Akers et al. (2009) identified somatic
mutations that were otherwise invisible by direct sequencing of the bulk
amplicon. Biallelic germline and somatic mutations were identified in
CCM lesions from all 3 forms of inherited CCMs. The somatic mutations
were found only in a subset of the endothelial cells lining the
cavernous vessels and not in interstitial lesion cells. Although widely
expressed in the different cell types of the brain, the authors also
suggested a unique role for the CCM proteins in endothelial cell
biology. Akers et al. (2009) suggested that CCM lesion genesis may
require complete loss of function for 1 of the CCM genes.

Gallione et al. (2011) identified a founder mutation in the Ashkenazi
Jewish population that affects mRNA splicing of the CCM2 gene causing
cerebral cavernous malformations (607929.0010).

ANIMAL MODEL

Hogan et al. (2008) found that deletion of Ccm1 in zebrafish caused
dilation of embryonic vessels. Vascular dilation was associated with
progressive spreading of endothelial cells and thinning of vessel walls.
Determination of cell fate, cell number, and endothelial cell-cell
contacts appeared normal. Ccm1 mutants, Ccm2 mutants, and Ccm1/Ccm2
double mutants had indistinguishable vascular phenotypes, suggesting
conservation of function.

Boulday et al. (2011) noted that deletion of Ccm1, Ccm2, or Ccm3 in mice
is embryonic lethal. They generated mice with an endothelial-specific
Ccm2 deletion at postnatal day 1, which resulted in vascular lesions
mimicking human CCM lesions. Deletion of Ccm1 or Ccm3 at postnatal day 1
resulted in similar cerebellar and retinal lesions. Ccm2 lesion
development was restricted to the venous bed. Boulday et al. (2011)
concluded that the consequences of Ccm2 deletion depend on the
developmental timing of the ablation and are associated with a
developmental stage with intense angiogenesis.

CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2
CCM2, 1-BP DEL, 23G

In a family in which 4 members had type 2 cerebral cavernous
malformations (603284), Liquori et al. (2003) found a 1-bp deletion in
exon 1 of the CCM2 gene (23delG), causing a frameshift at amino acid 23
and premature termination at amino acid 22.

CCM2, GLN107TER

In a family in which 2 members had type 2 cerebral cavernous
malformations (603284), Liquori et al. (2003) found a 319C-T transition
in exon 4 of the CCM2 gene, resulting in the nonsense mutation gln107 to
ter (Q107X).

.0003
CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2
CCM2, IVS5, G-A, -1

In a family in which 5 members had type 2 cerebral cavernous
malformations (603284), Liquori et al. (2003) found a splice junction
mutation (610-1G-A), involving the invariant G residue at the splice
acceptor site adjacent to exon 6.

.0004
CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2
CCM2, 4-BP DEL, NT169

In one family with 5 affected individuals and a second family with 4
affected individuals, Liquori et al. (2003) found that type 2 cerebral
cavernous malformations (603284) were associated with a 4-bp deletion in
exon 2 of the CCM2 gene (169-172delAGAC). The deletion caused a
frameshift at amino acid 57 with a premature stop at amino acid 58. Two
families were thought to be distantly related because they came from the
same ethnic background.

.0005
CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2
CCM2, MET1VAL

In affected members of a family with cerebral cavernous malformations
(603284), Denier et al. (2004) found a mutation in the initiating ATG
codon changing nucleotide 1 from A to G. In this family, 2 sisters and
the daughter of 1 of them were affected.

In a family with cerebral cavernous malformations (603284), Denier et

In a family with cerebral cavernous malformations (603284), Denier et
al. (2004) found that affected individuals had a leu198-to-arg (L198R)
mutation in exon 5 due to a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 593. In
this family, a brother and sister were affected as well as a daughter
and son.

.0008
CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2
CCM2, 2-BP DEL, 1248AG

In a family with cerebral cavernous malformations (603284) in 3
successive generations, Denier et al. (2004) found deletion of 2
nucleotides, 1248_1249delAG in exon 10 of the CCM2 gene.

.0009
CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2
CCM2, 77.6-KB DEL

Among a cohort of 63 families with cerebral cavernous malformations
(603284), Liquori et al. (2007) identified a 77.6-kb deletion in the
CCM2 gene in 8 probands (13%). The deletion encompassed exons 2 through
10, with the proximal breakpoint within an AluSx repeat in intron 1 and
the distal breakpoint within an AluSg repeat distal to exon 10.
Haplotype analysis suggested that this deletion may have occurred
independently at least twice in their cohort, although the evidence was
not conclusive.

Liquori et al. (2008) reported 6 additional CCM families from the United
States with the 77.6-kb CCM2 deletion. Haplotype analysis, which
included the previously reported families with this deletion, indicated
a founder effect. This deletion was not present in 24 Italian families
with CCM, indicating that it is specific to a certain cohort of
patients.

CEREBRAL CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS 2
CCM2, IVS1, GC-TT, +5

In 7 apparently unrelated probands from 10 different kindreds of
Ashkenazi Jewish descent segregating CCM2 (603284), Gallione et al.
(2011) identified a 2-bp change in the CCM2 gene caused by deletion of a
GC pair and insertion of a TT pair near the splice donor site of exon 1
(30+5_6delinsTT). The 2-bp change segregated with affected status in the
study families. Transcripts arising from the normal and mutant alleles
were examined by RT-PCR from affected and unaffected Ashkenazi Jewish
cerebral cavernous malformation family members. A synthetic splicing
system using a chimeric exon was used to visualize the effects of the
change on splice donor site utilization. The 2-bp change, when tested in
this in vitro synthetic splicing system, altered splice donor site
utilization. RT-PCR revealed loss of the transcript allele that was in
phase with the mutation. Gallione et al. (2011) concluded that this 2-bp
change in CCM2 disruted proper splice donor utilization leading to a
degraded transcript. Resequencing of the genomic region proximal and
distal to the CCM2 gene mutation revealed a common SNP haplotype in
affected individuals that demonstrated that this mutation was due to a
founder in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.

615051	TITLE *615051 ANKYRIN REPEAT- AND SOCS BOX-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6; ASB6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins of the ASB family, such as ASB6, contain central tandem ankyrin
(see 612641) repeats and a C-terminal suppressor of cytokine signaling
(SOCS) box. SOCS box proteins are predicted to be involved in protein
degradation by acting as a bridge between substrate proteins and E3
ubiquitin protein ligases (see 601623) (review by Kile et al., 2002).

CLONING

Kile et al. (2001) showed that the deduced 418-amino acid mouse Asb6
protein has 8 tandem ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal SOCS box.

GENE FUNCTION

Kohroki et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged ASB6 and several other
ASB family members interacted with endogenous CUL5 (601741) and RBX2
(RNF7; 603863) in immunoprecipitated HEK293 cells. The ASB proteins did
not interact with CUL2 (603135) or RBX1 (603814).

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ASB6 gene to chromosome 9q34.11 based on an
alignment of the ASB6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000555) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I; EC 1.6.5.3) catalyzes the
first step in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, in which transfer of
electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) is accompanied by
translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane.
B17.2L, or mimitin, is a complex I assembly factor (Ogilvie et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By searching for genes upregulated by MYC (190080) in a human
glioblastoma cell line, followed by database analysis and 5-prime and
3-prime RACE of a human erythroid leukemia cell cDNA library, Tsuneoka
et al. (2005) cloned mimitin. The deduced 169-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 19.9 kD. Mimitin contains a central domain
found in the complex I B17.2 protein (NDUFA12; 614530) and a C-terminal
ATP/GTP-binding site motif A. Human and mouse mimitin share 80% amino
acid identity. Western blot analysis detected endogenous mimitin at an
apparent molecular mass of 20 kD. Immunolocalization and Western blot
analysis of fractionated cells confirmed that mimitin is a mitochondrial
protein.

By database analysis, Ogilvie et al. (2005) identified B17.2L, a paralog
of the B17.2 gene of the aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. Human B17.2L
shares 20% and 17% amino acid identity with yeast B17.2L and human
B17.2, respectively. Western blot analysis detected B17.2L expression in
human fibroblasts, heart, skeletal muscle, and liver.
Immunoprecipitation of B17.2L from normal human heart mitochondria
coimmunoprecipitated other complex I subunits. By transient transfection
of fluorescence-tagged B17.2L in human embryonic kidney cells, Ogilvie
et al. (2005) confirmed that B17.2L is targeted to mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Tsuneoka et al. (2005) found that MYC induced mimitin expression in a
human glioblastoma cell line without necessarily stimulating cell
proliferation. Serum stimulation of starved cells increased MYC
expression, which was followed by increased mimitin expression.
Conversely, downregulation of MYC by phorbol esters was followed by
downregulation of mimitin expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis indicated that MYC bound an E box in the promoter region of the
mimitin gene during cell proliferation. Downregulation of mimitin
expression by small interfering RNA in a variety of human cancer cell
lines suppressed proliferation in a cell type-specific manner, with
greatest suppression in an esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)
cell line. Tsuneoka et al. (2005) found that mimitin was highly
expressed in 28 (80%) of 35 primary ESCC tumors. Mimitin expression
correlated with MYC expression and cell proliferation, but not with
histopathologic grade, stage of cancer, or age of patients.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tsuneoka et al. (2005) mapped the mimitin
gene to chromosome 5q12.1. Ogilvie et al. (2005) identified a pseudogene
on chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010), Ogilvie
et al. (2005) identified a homozygous mutation in the B17.2L gene
(609653.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFAF2, ARG45TER

In a patient with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010), Ogilvie
et al. (2005) identified a homozygous 182C-T transition in exon 2 of the
B17.2L gene, resulting in an arg45-to-ter (R45X) substitution.
Transduction of the patient's fibroblasts with a retroviral vector
expressing the wildtype B17.2L cDNA resulted in complete rescue of the
biochemical defect. The patient presented with a severe childhood-onset
progressive encephalopathy leading to death at age 13 years. Complex I
activity was less than 20% control values.

.0002
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFAF2, 1-BP DEL, 103A

In 2 sibs with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (252010) and Leigh
syndrome (256000), Calvo et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1-bp
deletion (103delA) in the NDUFAF2 gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination (Ile35SerfsTer17). Protein blot analysis did not
detect any NDUFAF2 protein, suggesting instability of the mutant protein
product.

;;INTERLEUKIN 18 RECEPTOR, BETA CHAIN; IL18RB;;
ACCESSORY PROTEIN-LIKE; ACPL
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Interleukin-18 (IL18; 600953) binds to IL18R1 (604494), a receptor with
sequence homology to IL1 receptors. Signaling by IL1 (147760, 147720)
through IL1R1 (147810) also requires the presence of the IL1 receptor
accessory protein (IL1RACP; 602626) to increase the affinity of IL1R for
IL1. By searching the EST database for a molecule homologous to IL1RACP,
Born et al. (1998) identified the interleukin-18 receptor accessory
protein (IL18RAP), which they called ACPL (accessory protein-like).
IL18RAP was unable to mediate signaling by IL1 but did play a role in
signaling by IL18. By screening an EL46.1 cDNA library with an IMAGE
clone, Born et al. (1998) obtained the full-length open reading frame
for the 600-amino acid protein. IL18RAP shares 65% amino acid identity
with the homologous mouse protein and 25 to 27% identity with members of
the IL1R family. IL18RAP is predicted to contain a 14-amino acid signal
peptide, a 342-amino acid extracellular (Ig superfamily-like) segment, a
single transmembrane region, and a 222-amino acid cytoplasmic domain
that is 32% identical to IL1R1. Northern blot analysis revealed that
IL18RAP mRNA, present predominantly as a 3.8-kb product, was expressed
strongly in peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, lung, and, to a lesser
extent, in colon, but not in any other tissue tested.

By Western blot analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Koskinen
et al. (2009) detected full-length IL18RAP as a band at 70 kD and a
second band at 37 kD, suggesting a putative alternative isoform of
IL18RAP.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Born et al. (1998) mapped the IL18RAP gene
to chromosome 2, near the IL18R1 and IL1R1 loci.

GENE FUNCTION

Born et al. (1998) found that although IL18RAP did not bind IL18 in
vitro, coexpression of IL18R1 and IL18RAP was required for IL18
responsiveness in terms of NF-kappa-B (see 164011) and JNK (see 601158)
activation. Furthermore, a mutant version of IL18RAP lacking the
cytoplasmic domain inhibited IL18 signaling.

IL18RAP gene and susceptibility to celiac disease, see CELIAC8 (612006).

;;BENZODIAZEPINE RECEPTOR, PERIPHERAL; BZRP; PBR;;
BENZODIAZEPINE PERIPHERAL BINDING SITE; PBS; BPBS;;
ISOQUINOLINE CARBOXAMIDE-BINDING PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSPO has channel-like properties and is primarily located in the outer
mitochondrial membrane. It is involved in a variety of functions,
including immunologic responses, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis. The
proapoptotic function of TSPO appears to involve modulation of the
mitochondrial transition pore (MPTP), a channel formed by the
voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC; see 604492) and the adenine
nucleotide transporter (ANT; see 103220). In steroidogenesis, TSPO
appears to operate as a translocator to transfer cholesterol into
mitochondria, where it is converted to pregnenolone (review by Veenman
et al., 2007).

CLONING

Benzodiazepines are psychoactive drugs with sedative, anxiolytic, and
anticonvulsant properties. They exert these actions through receptors
located in the central nervous system; however, some benzodiazepines
also interact with a different type of receptor present mainly in the
mitochondrial compartment of peripheral tissues. Riond et al. (1991)
found that the peripheral receptor is similar in rat, Chinese hamster,
and human. Based on these results, they screened a human cDNA library
with oligonucleotide probes derived from the Chinese hamster sequence.
One clone contained a full-length representation of human peripheral
binding site (PBS) mRNA. The amino acid sequence of human benzodiazepine
PBS deduced from the cDNA was 79% identical to that of rat Pbs.

GENE FUNCTION

Chang et al. (1992) found that the benzodiazepine receptor expressed in
COS-1 cells had remarkably different affinities than did the endogenous
human benzodiazepine receptor. They interpreted this finding as
indicating that the host cell and/or posttranslational modification had
important influences on function of the receptor protein.

Shoukrun et al. (2008) found that knockdown of TSPO with antisense TSPO
or small interfering RNA in HT29 human colorectal cancer cells increased
the rate of cell proliferation compared with controls and reduced the
rate of apoptosis. In contrast, pharmacologic activation of TSPO reduced
the tumorigenicity of HT29 xenografts in immunodeficient mice and
increased their rate of survival. Shoukrun et al. (2008) noted that
their results confirmed previous findings in mouse and rat, and they
concluded that TSPO is a proapoptotic factor.

- Reviews

Veenman et al. (2007) reviewed the roles of TSPO in immunologic
responses, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis. They suggested that the
involvement of TSPO in such disparate biologic functions may indicate a
multidimensional role for TSPO in the host-defense response to disease
and injury.

GENE STRUCTURE

Using a cloned human PBR cDNA as probe, Lin et al. (1993) cloned the
gene, which they found covers 13 kb and is divided into 4 exons, with
exon 1 encoding only a short 5-prime untranslated segment.

MAPPING

Using the cDNA of human BZRP as a probe, Riond et al. (1991) localized
the BSRP gene to chromosome 22q13.3 by in situ hybridization. Chang et
al. (1992) mapped the BZRP gene to chromosome 22 by hybridization to DNA
from a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel. With a regional panel for
chromosome 22, they localized the gene within band 22q13.31.

Bucan et al. (1993) mapped the mouse Bzrp gene to chromosome 15.

612647	TITLE *612647 RADIAL SPOKE HEAD 4, CHLAMYDOMONAS, HOMOLOG OF, A; RSPH4A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Radial spokes are regularly spaced along cilia, sperm, and flagella
axonemes and have a multisubunit 'stalk' and 'head' that form a signal
transduction scaffold between the central microtubule pair and dynein
(see 603297) arms. RSPH4A is predicted to be a component of the radial
spoke head based on homology with proteins in the biflagellate alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and other ciliates (Castleman et al., 2009).

CLONING

By genomewide linkage analysis and positional candidate gene analysis in
5 families with primary ciliary dyskinesia linked to chromosome 6q22
(CILD11; 612649) and central microtubule pair abnormalities, Castleman
et al. (2009) identified the RSPH4A and RSPH9 genes (612648). The
deduced RSPH4A protein contains 716 amino acids and shares about 30%
identity with the Chlamydomonas radial spoke head proteins Rsp4 and
Rsp6.

GENE STRUCTURE

Castleman et al. (2009) determined that the RSPH4A gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Castleman et al. (2009) mapped the RSPH4A
gene to chromosome 6q22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In affected members of 4 Pakistani families with CILD11, Castleman et
al. (2009) identified a homozygous mutation in the RSPH4A gene
(612647.0001). In affected members of a family of northern European
descent with CILD11, they identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the RSPH4A gene (612647.0001; 612647.0002). The patients
had classic respiratory features of CILD, but no situs abnormalities.
Electron microscopic studies showed complete absence of the central
microtubule pair of the ciliary axoneme. These findings suggested that
radial spoke proteins are not essential for embryonic nodal ciliary
function, which is important in the determination of left-right axis
development.

Kott et al. (2013) identified pathogenic mutations in the RSPH4A gene
(see, e.g., 612647.0004-612647.0005) in 7 (14%) of 48 families with with
a specific CILD phenotype characterized by ciliary central complex and
radial spoke defects. None of the patients had situs inversus.

In all 10 affected members of 4 Pakistani families with primary ciliary
dyskinesia-11 (612649), Castleman et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
460C-T transition in exon 1 of the RSPH4A gene, resulting in a
gln154-to-ter (Q154X) substitution. The patients had classic respiratory
features of CILD, but no situs abnormalities. Electron microscopic
studies showed complete absence of the central microtubule pair of the
ciliary axoneme.

RSPH4A, GLN109TER

In affected individuals in a family of northern European descent with
CILD11 (612649), Castleman et al. (2009) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the RSPH4A gene: a 325C-T transition
in exon 1 resulting in a gln109-to-ter (Q109X) substitution, and a
1468C-T transition in exon 3 resulting in an arg490-to-ter (R490X;
612647.0003) substitution. The patients had classic respiratory features
of CILD, but no situs abnormalities. Electron microscopic studies showed
complete absence of the central microtubule pair of the ciliary axoneme.

In a family with primary CILD11 (612649) without situs inversus, Kott et
al. (2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the RSPH4A
gene: a 1-bp deletion (667delA), resulting in premature termination
(Ser223AlafsTer15), and a 1-bp deletion (c.1720delA; 612647.0005),
resulting premature termination (Thr424GlnfsTer19). Transmission
electron microscopy showed that a variable proportion of cilia on
respiratory epithelial cells had central complex defects. Radial spokes
were absent in cilia with no central microtubule complex.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By examining genes arising from intra- and interchromosomal duplications
involving the ancestral chromosome 2 fusion site, Fan et al. (2002)
identified FOXD4L1 (611084), FOXD4L2, and FOXD4L3 (611086). The deduced
416-amino acid FOXD4L2 protein contains a central forkhead domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fan et al. (2002) determined that FOXD4L2 is a single-exon gene, and
they identified a TATA box in the promoter region.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fan et al. (2002) mapped the FOXD4L2 gene
to chromosome 9p11.2.

605394	TITLE *605394 BTB AND CNC HOMOLOGY 2; BACH2
;;BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the small Maf family are basic region leucine zipper (bZIP)
proteins that can function as transcriptional activators or repressors
(see MAFK; 600197). Small Maf proteins can switch from transcriptional
repressors to activators, depending on the proteins with which they form
heterodimers. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify MafK
heterodimerization partners, Oyake et al. (1996) identified mouse cDNAs
encoding Bach1 (602751) and Bach2. Both Bach proteins contain a BTB
(broad complex-tramtrack-bric-a-brac) or POZ (poxvirus and zinc finger)
protein-interaction domain and a CNC (Cap'n'collar)-type bZIP domain.

By screening a K562 erythroleukemia cell line with mouse Bach2 cDNA as
the probe, Sasaki et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding BACH2. The
deduced 841-amino acid protein is 89.5% identical to mouse Bach2, with
97% identity shared in the BTB and bZIP functional domains and 94%
identity shared in the serine-rich region. Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of an approximately 11.0-kb BACH2 transcript
restricted to thymus, spleen, and leukocytes; low levels were also
detected in small intestine and brain. Sasaki et al. (2000) found mRNA
and protein expression primarily in B-lymphoid rather than other
hematopoietic cell lines. RT-PCR analysis showed that BACH2, like mouse
Bach2, is expressed in primary B cells at the progenitor, precursor,
immature, and mature B-cell stages. Mouse Bach2 is not expressed in
plasma cells (Muto et al., 1998).

GENE FUNCTION

Oyake et al. (1996) demonstrated that mouse Bach1 and Bach2 form
heterodimers with MafK. Bach1 and Bach2 functioned as transcription
repressors in transfection assays using fibroblast cells, but they
functioned as a transcriptional activator and repressor, respectively,
in cultured erythroid cells. Therefore, the authors suggested that the
Bach proteins play important roles in coordinating transcription
activation and repression by MafK.

Gel shift analysis by Sasaki et al. (2000) showed that when
overexpressed, BACH2 binds to MAF recognition elements (MARE).
Overexpression also resulted in a loss of clonogenic activity.
BACH2/CA-1 microsatellite analysis indicated that loss of heterozygosity
occurred in 5 of 25 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (605027) patients.

MAPPING

By FISH, Sasaki et al. (2000) mapped the BACH2 gene to chromosome 6q15.
Southern blot analysis determined that BACH2 is a single-copy gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Muto et al. (2004) found that Bach2 -/- mice had high levels of serum
IgM but diminished concentrations of IgG subclasses and IgA compared
with wildtype mice. The Bach2 -/- mice also had deficient T
cell-independent and T cell-dependent IgG responses associated with
defective class switch recombination (CSR), somatic hypermutation, and
germinal center formation. While IgM plasma cell development was normal
in mutant mice, class-switched plasma cells were significantly lower
after spleen cell stimulation. Bach2-deficient B cells had reduced Aid
(Aicda; 605257) expression and deregulation of other CSR-associated
genes, notably Blimp1 (PRDM1; 603423), Xbp1 (194355), Irf4 (601900), and
Pax5 (167414). Muto et al. (2004) concluded that BACH2 is a regulator of
the antibody response.

Roychoudhuri et al. (2013) reported that Bach2-deficient mice appear
normal at birth but develop a progressive wasting disease with
diminished survival. Increased levels of autoantibodies were present,
and severe pulmonary and less severe intestinal inflammation was
accompanied by increased levels of Ccr4 (604836) and Ccr9 (604738) on
CD4+ T cells that home to lung and gut, respectively. Analysis of
reconstituted Rag1 (179615)-knockout mice indicated that Bach2 is
required for the formation of both thymic and induced regulatory T
(tTreg and iTreg) cells expressing Foxp3 (300292). ChIP and sequence
analysis determined that Bach2 represses numerous genes in effector
lineage cells, including Ccr4 and Ccr9. In the absence of Bach2, cells
stimulated under conditions to promote iTreg differentiation instead
differentiated into Foxp3-negative cells expressing Tbet (TBX21;
604895), Gata3 (131320), or Ror-gamma-t (RORC; 602943), characteristic
of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, respectively. Roychoudhuri et al. (2013)
concluded that BACH2 represses the differentiation programs of multiple
effector lineages in CD4+ T cells, stabilizes the development of Treg
cells, and constrains immune activation to promote immune homeostasis.

;;LEUKOSIALIN; LSN;;
LEUKOCYTE LARGE SIALOGLYCOPROTEIN;;
CD43;;
GPL115
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sialophorin (leukosialin) is a major sialoglycoprotein on the surface of
human T lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and some B lymphocytes,
which appears to be important for immune function and may be part of a
physiologic ligand-receptor complex involved in T-cell activation.

CLONING

Pallant et al. (1989) stated that sialophorin had been identified by the
L10 monoclonal antibody. Pallant et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA clone
encoding leukosialin from a library constructed from human peripheral
blood cells. Southern blot analysis suggested that the gene is present
in single copy.

Shelley et al. (1988, 1989) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones for
sialophorin. The longest sequenced clone was 1.7 kb and encoded 5 of 7
isolated tryptic peptides. Northern blot analysis indicated that the
sialophorin transcript is 2.5 kb long. The nucleotide sequence of the
1.7-kb clone showed that the sialophorin transcript has a
3-prime-noncoding region of 587 nucleotides, is polyadenylated, and has
the AATAAA polyadenylation signal. The derived sequence of 341 amino
acids showed that the sialophorin protein has 3 domains: an
extracellular domain of 195 amino acids, a hydrophobic transmembrane
domain of 23 amino acids, and a C-terminal intracellular domain of 123
amino acids which contains a number of sites that might be
phosphorylated by protein kinase C.

GENE FUNCTION

By introducing a cDNA encoding the human CD43 protein into an
antigen-responsive murine T-cell hybridoma, Park et al. (1991) found
that the antigen-specific activation of T cells was enhanced. The
intracellular domain of CD43, which is hyperphosphorylated during T-cell
activation, was required for this function.

Schmid et al. (1992) presented evidence that the galactoglycoprotein of
plasma represents the extracellular portion of CD43 derived by
proteolytic cleavage from the transmembrane portion. Bazil and
Strominger (1993) showed that CD43 is proteolytically cleaved from the
surface of stimulated lymphocytes and granulocytes. They suggested that
induced enzymatic cleavage of leukocyte receptors may represent a
general mechanism regulating surface expression of these molecules.

Using immunoprecipitation and cell-binding analyses, van den Berg et al.
(2001) showed that both the 240-kD SELPLG (600738) and the 130-kD CD43
proteins bind to macrophage-restricted SIGLEC1 (SN; 600751) in solution.
However, only T cell-bound CD43, and not SELPLG, in either the branched
or unbranched glycoform binds when expressed on the cell surface. Thus,
CD43 is the T-cell counterreceptor for SN.

The immunologic synapse is the T cell-APC (antigen-presenting cell)
contact site where T-cell receptors (TCRs), coreceptors, signaling
molecules, and adhesion receptors polarize upon antigen recognition. The
formation of the immunologic synapse is thought to be important for
receptor signal transduction and full T-lymphocyte activation. CD43 is a
large sialoprotein diffusely expressed in unactivated T cells. Using
antigen-activated T cells and confocal microscopy, Delon et al. (2001)
demonstrated that moesin (309845) is excluded from the region of T
cell-APC contact and colocalizes with CD43. Western blot and
immunocytochemical analyses showed that moesin is rapidly
dephosphorylated upon antigen recognition and then rephosphorylated on
threonine residues. Only phosphorylated moesin was able to bind CD43.
Delon et al. (2001) concluded that T-cell activation requires the
removal of CD43 from the immunologic synapse to allow efficient
engagement of the TCR with molecules on the APC.

Using mouse helper T cell lines and confocal microscopy, Allenspach et
al. (2001) determined that the cytoplasmic tail of CD43 is necessary and
sufficient for CD43 removal from the immunologic synapse. In at least
some cells, CD43 is located at the distal pole of the T cell together
with ezrin (123900) and moesin. No differences in the behavior of ezrin
and moesin were noted throughout the study. Using cells from Cd43 -/-
mice, Allenspach et al. (2001) observed that ezrin-radixin
(179410)-moesin (ERM) family proteins move independently of the large
CD43 mucin. Overexpression of a dominant-negative ERM mutant containing
the N-terminal 320 amino acids of ezrin inhibited the activation-induced
movement of CD43 without affecting conjugate formation. The
dominant-negative mutant reduced cytokine production but not the
expression of T-cell activation markers.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shelley et al. (1990) reported that the CD43 gene has a single intron of
378 bp that interrupts the sequence specifying the 5-prime untranslated
region of the mRNA. The gene is, therefore, unusual in that the discrete
extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular regions of the protein,
including repeat sequences in the extracellular region, are not encoded
by separate exons.

MAPPING

Shelley et al. (1989) determined that the human sialophorin gene appears
to be unique within the haploid genome, and they assigned it to
chromosome 16 by Southern blot analysis of DNA from rodent-human cell
hybrids. By study of somatic cell hybrids, Pallant et al. (1989)
demonstrated that the leukosialin gene is not X-linked; by in situ
hybridization, they mapped the gene to 16p11.2. Baecher et al. (1990)
demonstrated that the mouse leukosialin gene, designated Ly48, is
encoded by chromosome 7.

PATHOGENESIS

Sialophorin is defective in lymphocytes of patients with Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome (301000). Since the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is X-linked, its
primary cause must reside in a defect of a gene other than the
structural gene for sialophorin. (The existence of an autosomal form of
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome has been suggested (277970).) Specific
interaction of CD43 with a ligand on the surface of T cells appears to
contribute to T-cell activation. Rosenstein et al. (1991) presented
evidence that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1, or CD54; 147840)
is a ligand for CD43. Rosenstein et al. (1991) suggested that the defect
in T-cell function in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome may result from defective
CD43/ICAM1 interaction. Many patients with HIV infection have

613907	TITLE *613907 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 652; ZNF652
;;KIAA0924
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned ZNF652, which they designated
KIAA0924. The deduced protein contains 606 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected moderate ZNF652 expression in all tissues and specific brain
regions examined except spleen, where expression was low.

Using a sequence from CBFA2T3 (603870) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a human breast cDNA library, Kumar et al. (2006) cloned
ZNF652. The deduced 606-amino acid protein contains 7 central C2H2-type
zinc finger motifs. RNA dot-blot analysis revealed ubiquitous ZNF652
expression, with highest levels in breast, vulva, prostate, and
pancreas. ZNF652 expression was reduced in a number of cancers compared
with matched normal tissue. Western blot analysis detected ZNF652 at an
apparent molecular mass of 85 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis of cotransfected HEK293T cells, Kumar et
al. (2006) confirmed that ZNF652 interacted with CBFA2T3. Deletion
analysis revealed that the C-terminal 109-amino acids of ZNF652 were
required for the interaction, and inclusion of the ZNF652 central zinc
finger domain stabilized the interaction. Reporter gene assays showed
that ZNF652 functioned as a transcriptional repressor. CBFA2T3 enhanced
the repressor activity of ZNF652 in a dose-dependent manner.

Kumar et al. (2008) found that ZNF652 alone or in complex with CBFA2T3
bound the consensus ZNF652 response element (AAGGGTTAA) found in the
promoter region of the HEB (TCF12; 600480) gene. In HEK293T cells, which
express endogenous ZNF652 and CBFA2T3, overexpression of either
repressor downregulated HEB expression, and repression was enhanced by
coexpression of both ZNF652 and CBFA2T3. Mutation analysis revealed that
the NHR3 and NHR4 motifs of CBFA2T3 interacted with the proline-rich
stretch in the C terminus of ZNF652.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1999) mapped the ZNF652
gene to chromosome 17. Kumar et al. (2006) mapped the ZNF652 gene to
chromosome 17q21.32 by database analysis.

603420	TITLE *603420 CALUMENIN; CALU
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Many calcium-binding proteins are reported to be localized in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in such ER functions as protein
folding and sorting. Among these are RCN1 (602735), RCN2 (602584), and
calumenin (CALU), which form a novel family of calcium-binding proteins
in the ER and Golgi apparatus. By searching sequence databases with a
mouse Calu cDNA sequence (Yabe et al., 1997), Yabe et al. (1998)
identified a human CALU EST, which they used to clone a full-length CALU
cDNA. The cDNA encodes a deduced 315-amino acid protein containing 6
EF-hand motifs, 1 potential N-glycosylation site, and a C-terminal ER
retention signal. The human and mouse CALU proteins are 98% identical.
Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the 3.4-kb CALU mRNA is
ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Southern blot analysis using a
human CALU cDNA probe detected bands in a variety of species.

MAPPING

Yabe et al. (1997) mapped the mouse Calu gene to the proximal portion of
chromosome 7. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Yabe et al. (1998)
localized the human CALU gene to 7q32, which was an unexpected result
due to the homology of synteny between proximal mouse chromosome 7 and
human 19q13.2-q13.3.

612603	TITLE *612603 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 1A; LCE1A
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 1; LEP1
LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE GENE CLUSTER, INCLUDED;;
LCE GENE CLUSTER, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LCE1A belongs to the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster within
the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1. The LCE
cluster contains multiple conserved genes that encode stratum corneum
proteins, and these genes are expressed relatively late during fetal
assembly of the skin cornified envelope (Jackson et al., 2005). For
further information on the LCE gene cluster, see GENE FAMILY below.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified human
LCE1A, which they called LEP1. RT-PCR analysis detected LEP1 in human
skin, but not in heart or esophagus. In situ hybridization of mouse
embryos showed that group 1 LEP genes, such as Lep1, were expressed just
before barrier formation in the epidermal barrier formation pattern.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) found that LCE1A, like other
LCE1 genes, was predominantly expressed in human fetal, arm, penal, and
abdominal skin. Little to no LCE1A expression was detected in vulva,
tongue, and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE1 genes, including
LCE1A, was upregulated in cultured normal human keratinocytes by
ultraviolet irradiation, but not by calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that the LCE1A gene, like most LCE
genes, contains 2 exons. Exon 1 is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE1A
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) stated that the mouse Lce1a gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene
cluster on chromosome 3F1.

GENE FAMILY

- LCE Gene Cluster

Jackson et al. (2005) stated that the LCE gene cluster spans over 320 kb
within the EDC on chromosome 1q21 and can be divided into 3 gene groups,
designated LCE1, LCE2, and LCE3, based on chromosomal position and
protein homology. The LCE1, LCE2, and LCE3 subclusters are interspersed
with 2 individual LCE genes, LCE4A (612618) and LCE5A (612619), 4 LCE
pseudogenes, and several non-LCE genes. The LCE genes appear to have
arisen by gene amplification. Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005)
found that the LCE1 and LCE2 genes were expressed in skin, whereas the
LCE3 genes showed low-level, tissue-specific expression in all
barrier-forming epithelia tested, including internal epithelia. The LCE
genes responded in a group-specific manner to calcium and ultraviolet
light, with calcium causing upregulation of LCE2 genes, and ultraviolet
light causing upregulation of LCE1 and LCE2 genes.

De Guzman Strong et al. (2010) used a computational approach to identify
conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the EDC queried for regulatory
function. Coordinate expression of EDC genes during mouse embryonic skin
development and a striking degree of synteny and linearity in the EDC
locus across a wide range of mammalian (placental and marsupial) genomes
suggested an evolutionary conserved regulatory milieu in the EDC. CNEs
identified by comparative genomics exhibited dynamic regulatory activity
(enhancer or repressor) in differentiating or proliferating conditions.
Epidermal-specific, developmental in vivo enhancer activities (DNaseI
and transgenic mouse assays) were demonstrated in CNEs, including one
within the psoriasis-associated LCE3C (612615)_LCE3B (612614) deletion
(see 603935).

120650	TITLE *120650 COMPLEMENT COMPONENT RECEPTOR 2; CR2
;;COMPLEMENT COMPONENT 3d RECEPTOR; C3DR;;
EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS RECEPTOR;;
EBV RECEPTOR;;
CD21
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Complement component receptor-2 (CR2, CD21) is the membrane protein on B
lymphocytes to which the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) binds during infection
of these cells. See also CR1 (120620). Yefenof et al. (1976) found
complete overlapping of EBV receptors and C3 (120700) receptors on human
B lymphocytes.

CD21, together with CD19 (107265), CD81 (186845), and CD225 (IFITM1;
604456), forms the B-cell coreceptor complex, which lowers the
activation threshold of the B-cell antigen receptor (summary by Thiel et
al., 2012).

CLONING

Rodriguez de Cordoba and Rubinstein (1986) demonstrated that
quantitative variations of the C3b/C4b receptor (CR1) in human
erythrocytes are controlled by genes within the regulator of complement
activation (RCA) gene cluster. Rodriguez de Cordoba and Rubinstein
(1986) symbolized this gene as C3bRQ. Moore et al. (1987) presented the
nucleotide and derived amino acid sequence of the CR2 gene. They pointed
out the close similarity to CR1 and to factor H, which are closely
linked loci in 1q32.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Szakonyi et al. (2001) described the x-ray structure of CR2 in complex
with its ligand C3d at 2.0 angstroms. The structure revealed extensive
main chain interactions between C3d and only 1 short consensus repeat
(SCR) of CR2 and substantial SCR side-to-side packing.

The 2 N-terminal SCRs (SCR1-SCR2) of CD21 interact with the EBV
glycoprotein gp350/220 and also with the natural CD21 ligand, C3d. Prota
et al. (2002) described the crystal structure of the CD21 SCR1-SCR2
fragment in the absence of ligand and demonstrated that it is able to
bind EBV. Based on a functional analysis of wildtype and mutant CD21 and
molecular modeling, they identified a likely region for EBV attachment
and demonstrated that this region is not involved in the interaction
with C3d. A comparison with the structure of CD21 SCR1-SCR2 in complex
with C3d showed that, in both cases, CD21 assumes compact V-shaped
conformations. However, the analysis revealed a surprising degree of
flexibility at the SCR1-SCR2 interface, suggesting that the interactions
between the 2 domains are not specific.

GENE FUNCTION

Using surface plasmon resonance analysis and ELISA, Asokan et al. (2006)
showed that IFNA (IFNA1; 147660) bound CR2 in the same affinity range as
the CR2 ligands EBV-gp350, C3d/iC3b, and CD23 (FCER2; 151445). IFNA
interacted with SCR1 and SCR2 within the same region of CR2 that serves
as the binding site for the other CR2 ligands. Treatment of B cells with
anti-CR2 diminished induction of IFNA-responsive genes. Asokan et al.
(2006) proposed that the roles of CR2 and IFNA in development of
autoimmunity may be mechanistically linked to pathogenesis of systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700).

MAPPING

Weis et al. (1987) demonstrated by Southern analysis of DNA from somatic
cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization using partial cDNA clones that
the CR2 gene is located on band 1q32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Susceptibility to Systemic Lupus Erythematosis

Wu et al. (2007) found evidence of linkage at chromosome 1q32.2 in a
targeted genome scan of 1q21-q43 in 126 SLE multiplex families (see
SLEB9, 610927) containing 151 affected sib pairs (nonparametric linkage
score, 2.52; p = 0.006). The authors then analyzed the CR2 gene in 1,416
individuals from 258 Caucasian and 142 Chinese SLE simplex families and
demonstrated that a common 3-SNP haplotype (120650.0001) was associated
with SLE susceptibility (p = 0.00001) with a 1.54-fold increased risk
for development of disease. Wu et al. (2007) concluded that the CR2 gene
is likely a susceptibility gene for SLE.

- Common Variable Immunodeficiency-7

In a patient with a mild form of combined variable immunodeficiency-7
(CVID7; 614699), Thiel et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygous
mutations in the CD21 gene (120650.0002 and 120650.0003). Both mutations
caused functionally null alleles, with lack of CD21 expression on the
patient's B cells. The patient had hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent
infections. However, antibodies against recall antigens, such as
measles, mumps, and varicella, were normal, and he had antibodies
against EBV, suggesting that CD21 is not absolutely required for EBV
entry. The B cells showed a mature antigen phenotype, but there was a
reduction in class-switched memory B cells. Together with the
demonstrated defects in CD19 (107265) and CD81 (186845), this CD21
deficiency was the third genetic defect affecting the B-cell coreceptor
complex in humans. All 3 defects share the features of severely
decreased memory B-cell numbers, hypogammaglobulinemia, and recurrent
infections.

ANIMAL MODEL

Fairweather et al. (2006) found that mice deficient in both Cr1 and Cr2
had increased acute myocarditis and pericardial fibrosis due to
coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), leading to early progression to dilated
cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Increased inflammation was not
associated with increased viral replication. Immunofluorescence
microscopy demonstrated increased numbers of macrophages, higher Il1b
(147720) levels, and immune complex deposition in the heart. The mouse
complement regulatory protein, Crry, was increased in cardiac
macrophages, while immature B cells were increased in mutant mice after
CVB3 infection. Fairweather et al. (2006) concluded that CR1/CR2
expression is not necessary for CVB3 clearance, but it is involved in
protection against immune-mediated damage to the heart.

Wu et al. (2007) analyzed the CR2 gene in 1,416 individuals from 258
Caucasian and 142 Chinese SLE simplex (610927) families and demonstrated
that the major allele 3-SNP haplotype (+21T-C, dbSNP rs3813946; a
synonymous G-A SNP, dbSNP rs1048971; and a G-A SNP resulting in an S639N
substitution, dbSNP rs17615) was associated with SLE susceptibility (p =
0.00001) with a 1.54-fold increased risk for development of disease.
Studies using luciferase constructs revealed that the +21T-C SNP located
in the 5-prime untranslated region alters transcriptional activity.

IMMUNODEFICIENCY, COMMON VARIABLE, 7
CR2, IVS6DS, G-C, +1

In a 28-year-old man with common variable immunodeficiency-7 (CVID7;
614699), Thiel et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the CR2 gene: a G-to-C transversion in the donor site of
exon 6 (1225+1G-C), resulting in the in-frame skipping of exon 6, and a
2297G-A transition in exon 13, resulting in a trp766-to-ter (W766X;
120650.0003) substitution, which was demonstrated to result in
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The splice site mutation resulted in a
shorter mRNA that putatively codes for a truncated CD21 protein
predicted to lack the extracellular short consensus repeats 5 and 6.
Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, neither
of which were found in 100 controls. Transfection of the mutations in
293T cells showed absence of CD21 expression at the cell surface,
consistent with complete absence of CD21 on the patient's B cells. The
patient had recurrent infections, splenomegaly, and
hypogammaglobulinemia affecting mainly IgG. IgA values were slightly
reduced and IgM levels were low-normal. Antibodies against recall
antigens, such as measles, mumps, and varicella, were normal, and he had
antibodies against EBV, suggesting that CD21 is not absolutely required
for EBV entry. The B cells showed a mature antigen phenotype, but there
was a reduction in class-switched memory B cells. Patient B cells showed
reduced binding to a C3d (see 120700)-containing immune complex and to
EBV compared to control cells, and also showed no costimulatory activity
via the B-cell receptor complex. Patient cells showed normal
proliferative response and production of immunoglobulin upon stimulation
with anti-IgM and anti-CD40 (109535), and the patient mounted a normal
antibody response to protein vaccination, although his response to
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination was somewhat impaired.

604780	TITLE *604780 ABHYDROLASE DOMAIN-CONTAINING 5; ABHD5
;;COMPARATIVE GENE IDENTIFICATION 58; CGI58;;
NCIE2 GENE; NCIE2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ABHD5 functions as an acyltransferase for the synthesis of phosphatidic
acid, the major intermediate in membrane and storage lipid biosynthesis.
It also functions as a coactivator of adipocyte triglyceride lipase
(ATGL, or PNPLA2; 609059) (Ghosh et al., 2008).

CLONING

By examining the critical region for Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS;
275630), a rare autosomal recessive form of NCIE (see 242300), on
chromosome 3p21, Lefevre et al. (2001) identified several candidate
genes, one of which, designated CGI58, was identified by Lai et al.
(2000) as having homology to a protein from C. elegans. Lefevre et al.
(2001) determined that CGI58 encodes a 349-amino acid protein of
approximately 39 kD that has strong homology with several members of a
large family defined by an alpha/beta hydrolase fold. CGI58 contains 3
sequence motifs that correspond to a catalytic triad found in the
esterase/lipase/thioesterase subfamily but differs in that its putative
catalytic triad contains an asparagine in place of the usual serine
residue. Database analysis showed wide expression of CGI58 in various
tissues, including skin, lymphocytes, liver, skeletal muscle, and brain.
Database analysis also revealed conservation of CGI58 from bacteria to
human.

Ghosh et al. (2008) noted that human CGI58 contains esterase,
hydrolase/acyltransferase, and lysophospholipase domains.

Using Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of differentiated
mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Yamaguchi et al. (2004) detected Cgi58
predominantly at the surface of lipid droplets, where it colocalized
with perilipin (PLIN1; 170290) and Adrp (PLIN2; 103195). Some Cgi58 was
also detected in the cytosol of differentiated adipocytes, but it was
not detected prior to differentiation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lefevre et al. (2001) determined that the ABHD5 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

Lefevre et al. (2001) identified the ABHD5 gene in the critical region
for Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome on chromosome 3p21.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid and protein pull-down assays, Yamaguchi et al. (2004)
found that rat Cgi58 bound directly to mouse perilipin and Adrp.

Ghosh et al. (2008) found that purified recombinant human CGI58 had
acyltransferase activity and converted lysophosphatidic acid to
phosphatidic acid using palmitoyl-CoA or oleoyl-CoA as acyl donors.
CGI58 did not use any other lysophospholipid as acyl acceptor; rather,
its activity was inhibited by all other lysophospholipids or
phospholipids examined, predominantly lysophosphatidylcholine.
Biochemical and Western blot analyses of mouse white adipose tissue
suggested that Cgi58 functions in the cytosol as well as on lipid
droplets. Expression of human CGI58 complemented the metabolic defect in
yeast lacking the acyltransferase Ict1. Overexpression of CGI58 in yeast
increased the amount of all major phospholipids examined and reduced the
amount of triacylglycerol. The CGI58 mutations gln130 to pro (Q130P;
604780.0004) and glu260 to lys (E260K; 604780.0007), which eliminate the
ability of CGI58 to activate ATGL, had no effect on CGI58
acyltransferase activity. Ghosh et al. (2008) concluded that CGI58 has
independent ATGL coactivation and acyltransferase activities.

Using a cell culture model and various biochemical approaches, Wang et
al. (2011) investigated the mechanisms by which PLIN1, PLIN2, and PLIN5
(613248) control lipolysis by ATGL and its colipase, CGI58. PLIN5
exerted a negative regulatory role in lipid droplet hydrolysis by
binding and inhibiting ATGL activity at the lipid droplet surface under
basal conditions. Even after protein kinase A (PKA; see 188830)
activation, release of fatty acid was only modestly increased. In
contrast, recruitment of CGI58, followed by interaction with ATGL,
increased lipolysis. Neither PLIN1 nor PLIN2 directly interacted with
ATGL. Wang et al. (2011) proposed that PLIN5 plays a critical role in
oxidative tissues (e.g., heart and skeletal muscle) to protect
mitochondria from a rapid increase of fatty acid during lipolysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 9 families from the Mediterranean basin segregating Chanarin-Dorfman
syndrome (275630), Lefevre et al. (2001) identified 8 different
haplotypes and homozygous mutations in the ABHD5 gene
(604780.0001-604780.0008).

ANIMAL MODEL

Radner et al. (2010) obtained Cgi58 -/- mice at the expected mendelian
frequency, but they died within 16 hours after birth. Cgi58 -/- newborns
were smaller and weighed less than wildtype littermates, and they showed
abnormally low plasma lipid and glucose levels, ectopic lipid
accumulation, granulocyte vacuolization, and hepatic steatosis. Cgi58
-/- epidermis exhibited characteristics of lamellar ichthyosis with
impaired barrier function. Isolated fibroblasts from Cgi58 -/- embryos
showed excessive lipid storage due to impaired activation of
Atgl-mediated triglyceride hydrolysis. Immunohistochemical analysis of
Cgi58 -/- epidermis revealed delayed keratinocyte differentiation and
corneocyte formation. Unlike wildtype epidermis, Cgi58 -/- epidermis
transplanted onto nude mice exhibited severe growth retardation and
lacked fur development, suggesting that the skin defect in Cgi58 -/-
mice is inherent to the skin and not due to systemic Cgi58 deficiency.
Acylceramides are obligatory precursors for the covalent binding of
omega-OH-ceramides to corneocyte proteins. Characterization of the
corneal lipid envelope revealed reduced abundance of covalently bound
omega-OH-ceramides, elevated levels of free omega-OH-ceramides, and
undetectable acylceramides in Cgi58 -/- skin compared with wildtype or
Atgl -/- samples. Radiolabeled oleic acid was not released from the
triglyceride pool and was not converted to phospholipids or
acylceramides. The function of Cgi58 in skin appeared to be independent
of Atgl. Radner et al. (2010) concluded that CGI58 has a crucial role in
epidermal triglyceride catabolism for acylceramide synthesis, in
addition to its role in triglyceride homeostasis and energy catabolism.

Yamaguchi et al. (2004) found that expression of the corresponding
mutation in rat Cgi58 (Q132P) in 3 different cell lines caused
mistargeting of Cgi58 away from lipid droplets and toward a diffuse
cytoplasmic distribution. The mutant protein did not interact with

droplets.

Yamaguchi et al. (2004) found that expression of the corresponding
mutation in rat Cgi58 (E262K) in 3 different cell lines caused
mistargeting of Cgi58 away from lipid droplets and toward a diffuse
cytoplasmic distribution. The mutant protein did not interact with
perilipin (PLIN1; 170290) or colocalize with perilipin on lipid
droplets.

613939	TITLE *613939 SPERMATOGENESIS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 20; SPATA20
;;SPERM-SPECIFIC PROTEIN 411; SSP411
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Shi et al. (2004) cloned rat Spata20, which they called Ssp411, and they
identified human SSP411 by database analysis. The deduced 787-amino acid
human protein shares 87% identity with rat Ssp411. SSP411 contains an
N-terminal CxxC thioredoxin (TXN; 187700)-like motif (CHWC) that is
conserved in human, mouse, and rat. Rat Ssp411 also has putative sites
for N- and O-glycosylation and phosphorylation. The N-terminal region of
rat Ssp411 was predicted to assume a thioredoxin fold with a potential
active-site disulfide bond between the cysteines of the CHWC motif.
Northern blot and semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses of rat tissues
detected Ssp411 in testis only, where it was expressed in spermatids,
but not in spermatocytes or spermatogonia. In situ hybridization of
adult rat testis detected Ssp411 in round spermatids and early elongated
spermatids. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Ssp411 protein
predominantly in elongated spermatids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Shi et al. (2004) determined that the SPATA20 gene contains 16 exons and
spans 8.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Shi et al. (2004) mapped the SPATA20 gene
to chromosome 17. They mapped the mouse Spata20 gene to chromosome 11.

Hartz (2011) mapped the SPATA20 gene to chromosome 17q21.33 based on an
alignment of the SPATA20 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025000) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

615295	TITLE *615295 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 34; USP34
;;KIAA0570
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin (191339)-specific proteases, like USP34, remove ubiquitin
modifications from ubiquitinated proteins and thereby rescue these
proteins from proteasomal degradation (Lui et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) obtained a partial USP34 clone, which they
designated KIAA0570. RT-PCR detected variable USP34 expression in all
tissues examined.

Lui et al. (2011) stated that full-length USP34 contains 3,546 amino
acids and possesses a central ubiquitin hydrolase domain characteristic
of deubiquitinating enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

AXIN1 (603816) functions within a 'destruction complex' to inhibit
signaling through the Wnt (see 164820)-beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)
pathway, which modulates multiple cellular processes during embryonic
development and adult tissue homeostasis. Lui et al. (2011) found that
USP34 interacted directly with ubiquitinated AXIN1 in AXIN1-containing
complexes in human cell lines. USP34 conferred deubiquitinating activity
to AXIN1 complexes and promoted AXIN1 nuclear accumulation. Knockdown of
USP34 reduced AXIN1 content and beta-catenin signaling, and AXIN1 levels
could be rescued by inhibition of the proteasome. In vitro, the isolated
recombinant USP34 hydrolytic core region exhibited robust ubiquitin
isopeptidase activity that required the catalytic residue cys1903. Lui
et al. (2011) concluded that nuclear AXIN1 has a positive regulatory
role in Wnt-beta-catenin signaling that is controlled by USP34.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the USP34 gene
to chromosome 2.

Hartz (2013) mapped the USP34 gene to chromosome 2p15 based on an
alignment of the USP34 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB011142) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

608360	TITLE *608360 LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 8A; LRRC8A
;;LRRC8;;
KIAA1437
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned LRRC8, which they designated
KIAA1437. The deduced 811-amino acid protein shares 30% identity with
rat densin-180. RT-PCR ELISA detected expression within all tissues and
specific brain regions examined. Highest expression was found in adult
brain, followed by adult kidney, ovary, lung, liver, heart, and fetal
brain and liver. Within specific adult brain regions, highest expression
was detected in amygdala and caudate nucleus.

Kubota et al. (2004) noted that the human LRRC8A gene contains 810 amino
acids and shares 99% amino acid sequence identity with the mouse
ortholog. They identified 4 N-terminal transmembrane domains and 16
C-terminal extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRRs).

GENE FUNCTION

Using semiquantitative PCR, Kubota et al. (2004) observed that mRNA
expression of LRRC8A in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was
eventually decreased by long-term stimulation by phytohemagglutinin,
contrary to the expression of other LRRC8 family members.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LRRC8
gene to chromosome 9 (TMAP SGC34869).

Kubota et al. (2004) mapped the LRRC8A gene to chromosome 9q34.11 by
genomic sequence analysis. They localized the orthologous mouse gene to
chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Sawada et al. (2003) studied a girl with a balanced translocation,
t(9;20)(q33.2;q12), who had congenital agammaglobulinemia (AGM5; 613506)
and minor facial anomalies; she lacked B cells in peripheral blood and
showed epicanthic folds, mild hypertelorism, high-arched palate, and
lowered ears. Sawada et al. (2003) isolated the LRRC8 gene at the
translocation site on chromosome 9. The LRRC8 gene has 4 transmembrane
helices with 1 isolated and 8 sequentially located leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs). It was expressed on T cells as well as on B-lineage cells. The
translocation truncated the LRRC8 gene, resulting in deletion of the
eighth, ninth, and half of the seventh LRR domains (608360.0001) located
close to the C terminus. Protein products derived from the truncated
gene were coexpressed on white blood cells with the intact LRRC8 protein
from the untranslocated allele. Transplantation experiments with murine
bone marrow cells that were forced to express the truncated LRRC8 showed
that expression of the truncated protein inhibited B cell development,
producing a dominant-negative effect. The results indicated that LRRC8
is required for B cell development.

Conley (2003) commented on the variety of genes in which mutations can
cause congenital agammaglobulinemia through failure of B-cell
development. The genes encode components of the pre-B cell receptor or
proteins that are activated by crosslinking of the pre-B cell receptor.
Defects in these genes result in a block in B-cell differentiation at
the pro-B to pre-B cell transition. The defect in the LRRC8 gene in the
patient described by Sawada et al. (2003) caused a block at exactly the
same point in B-cell differentiation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
AGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA 5 (1 family)
LRRC8A, 1-BP INS, 2681T, TRANSLOCATION 20

In a patient with agammaglobulinemia-5 (613506), Sawada et al. (2003)
identified a reciprocal translocation, t(9;20)(q33.2;q12), and
demonstrated truncation of the LRRC8A gene, which was located at the
chromosome 9 breakpoint. The truncation resulted in deletion of the
eighth, ninth, and half of the seventh LRR domains located close to the
C terminus. The truncated gene encoded 754 amino acides, including 719
derived from exon 1 of the LRCC8A gene. In white cells, protein products
derived from the truncated gene were coexpressed with the intact LRRC8A
protein from the untranslocated allele. Experiments in mouse bone marrow
cells indicated that the truncated protein inhibited B-cell development.
A dominant-negative mechanism for expression of the defect in the
heterozygote was proposed.

C-terminal residues of Erbb2 (164870) as bait, Borg et al. (2000) cloned
Erbb2ip, which they called Erbin. They cloned human ERBB2IP by RT-PCR of
a human B-lymphocyte cell line. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein
contains 16 canonical LRR (leucine-rich repeat) motifs at the N
terminus, followed by an LRR-like domain, proline-rich stretches that
may represent binding sites for SH3 and WW domains, and a C-terminal PDZ
domain. Northern blot analysis revealed a 7.2-kb transcript in most
human and mouse tissues. Western blot analysis indicated a 180-kD
doublet in all tissues tested.

Favre et al. (2001) cloned ERBB2IP in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human
keratinocyte cDNA library with the N terminus of bullous pemphigoid
antigen-1 (BPAG1; 113810) as bait. They observed several splice
variants. ERBB2IP was expressed as a doublet of about 6.9 to 7.4 kb in
human keratinocytes and in a keratinocyte cell line. Semiquantitative
RT-PCR indicated numerous transcripts expressed in most tissues. Western
blot analysis showed a 200-kD in differentiated cells but not in
undifferentiated keratinocytes.

Huang et al. (2001) cloned Erbb2ip from mouse muscle, brain, and heart
cDNA libraries in a yeast 2-hybrid screen using Erbb2 as bait. Erbb2ip
was expressed as a 180-kD protein in brain, skeletal muscle, primary
muscle cultures, and muscle cell lines. Erbb2ip expression was found at
a similar level in myoblasts and myotubes, suggesting that expression is
not differentially regulated in muscle. By immunolocalization studies,
they colocalized Erbb2ip with the acetylcholine receptor at the
neuromuscular junction. Both Erbb2 and Erbb2ip were also found in
synaptosomes from adult mouse brain and copurified with postsynaptic
densities.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation, mutation analysis, and GST pull-down
experiments, Borg et al. (2000) determined that ERBB2IP interacts with
nonactivated ERBB2 and that the interaction requires the PDZ domain of
ERBB2IP. They further showed by immunolocalization studies that the 2
proteins colocalize to the basolateral surface of polarized human colon
carcinoma cells and that mutation of the PDZ domain of ERBB2IP causes
mislocalization of ERBB2 in stably transfected canine kidney cells.

By mutation analysis and in vitro binding assays, Favre et al. (2001)
determined that ERBB2IP interacts specifically with BPAG1 and integrin
beta-4 (147557).

Huang et al. (2001) found that mouse Erbb2ip associates with Psd95
(602887). Mutation analysis indicated that the interaction is dependent
upon the PDZ domain of Psd95.

GENE STRUCTURE

Favre et al. (2001) determined that the ERBB2IP gene contains at least
26 exons. Sequence comparison of ERBB2IP variants indicated that the
variants are likely caused by alternate splicing between exons 21 and
26.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ERBB2IP
gene to chromosome 5 (TMAP WI-31186). Favre et al. (2001) stated that
sequence analysis places the ERBB2IP gene on the long arm of chromosome
5 between D5S427 and D5S647.

176740	TITLE *176740 PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN; PCNA
;;DNA POLYMERASE DELTA AUXILIARY PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Travali et al. (1989) isolated a cDNA clone of the entire human PCNA
gene and flanking sequences.

PCNA was originally identified by immunofluorescence as a nuclear
protein whose appearance correlated with the proliferative state of the
cell. A cell cycle-dependent protein described by Bravo (1986) and
called cyclin was shown to be identical to PCNA. The PCNA protein has
been highly conserved during evolution; the deduced amino acid sequences
of rat and human differ by only 4 of 261 amino acids. The human
anti-PCNA autoantibodies react not only with the nuclei of proliferating
cells of all experimental animals so far examined but also with the
nuclei of plant cells. Suzuka et al. (1989) demonstrated the presence of
the PCNA/cyclin-related genes in higher plants.

GENE FUNCTION

PCNA is required for replication of SV40 DNA in vitro and has been
identified as the auxiliary protein (cofactor) for DNA polymerase delta
(174761). Unlike DNA polymerases alpha (312040), beta (174760), and
gamma (174763), DNA polymerase delta has exonuclease activity. Since the
exonuclease activity is in the 3-prime-to-5-prime direction, DNA
polymerase delta has a proofreading activity and is expected to play a
significant role in the maintenance of the fidelity of mammalian DNA
replication (Suzuka et al., 1989).

It had been speculated that genetic engineering could improve the
long-term function of vascular grafts that are prone to atherosclerosis
and occlusion. Mann et al. (1995) showed that an 'intraoperative gene
therapy approach' using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to block medial
smooth muscle cell proliferation can prevent the accelerated
atherosclerosis that is responsible for autologous vein graft failure.
Selective prevention of the expression of genes for 2 cell cycle
regulatory proteins, PCNA and cell division cycle kinase-2 (CDK2;
116953), was achieved in the smooth muscle cells of rabbit jugular veins
grafted into the carotid arteries. This alteration of gene expression
successfully redirected vein graft biology away from neointimal
hyperplasia and toward medial hypertrophy, yielding conduits that more
closely resembled normal arteries. Furthermore, the genetically
engineered grafts proved resistant to diet-induced atherosclerosis.

Hasan et al. (2001) demonstrated that p300 (602700) may have a role in
DNA repair synthesis through its interaction with PCNA. Hasan et al.
(2001) demonstrated that in vitro and in vivo p300 forms a complex with
PCNA that does not depend on the S phase of the cell cycle. A large
fraction of both p300 and PCNA colocalized to speckled structures in the
nucleus. Furthermore, the endogenous p300-PCNA complex stimulates DNA
synthesis in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated
that p300 is associated with freshly synthesized DNA after ultraviolet
irradiation. Hasan et al. (2001) suggested the p300 may participate in
chromatin remodeling at DNA lesion sites to facilitate PCNA function in
DNA repair synthesis.

The RAD6 pathway (312180, 179095) is central to postreplicative DNA
repair in eukaryotic cells. Two principal elements of this pathway are
the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes RAD6 and the MMS2 (603001)-UBC13
(603679) heterodimer, which are recruited to chromatin by the RING
finger proteins RAD18 (605256) and RAD5 (608048), respectively. Hoege et
al. (2002) showed that UBC9 (601661), a SUMO (see 601912)-conjugating
enzyme, is also affiliated with this pathway and that PCNA, a DNA
polymerase sliding clamp involved in DNA synthesis and repair, is a
substrate. PCNA is monoubiquitinated through RAD6 and RAD18, modified by
lys63-linked multiubiquitination, which additionally requires MMS2,
UBC13, and RAD5, and is conjugated to SUMO by UBC9. All 3 modifications
affect the same lysine residue of PCNA, lys164, suggesting that they
label PCNA for alternative functions. Hoege et al. (2002) demonstrated
that these modifications differentially affect resistance to DNA damage,
and that damage-induced PCNA ubiquitination is elementary for DNA repair
and occurs at the same conserved residue in yeast and humans.

SUMO uses a ubiquitin conjugation system to counteract the effects of
ubiquitination. Ubiquitin and SUMO compete for modification of PCNA, an
essential processivity factor for DNA replication and repair. Whereas
multiubiquitination is mediated by components of the RAD6 pathway and
promotes error-free repair, SUMO modification is associated with
replication. Stelter and Ulrich (2003) demonstrated that RAD6-mediated
monoubiquitination of PCNA activates translesion DNA synthesis by the
damage-tolerant polymerases eta (603968) and zeta (602776) in yeast.
Moreover, polymerase zeta is differentially affected by monoubiquitin
and SUMO modification of PCNA. Whereas ubiquitination is required for
damage-induced mutagenesis, both SUMO and monoubiquitin contribute to
spontaneous mutagenesis in the absence of DNA damage. Stelter and Ulrich
(2003) concluded that their data assigned a function to SUMO during S
phase and demonstrated how ubiquitin and SUMO, by regulating the
accuracy of replication and repair, contribute to overall genomic
stability.

Poot et al. (2004) identified 4 potential PCNA-binding motifs in
Williams syndrome transcription factor (WSTF, or BAZ1B; 605681). By
immunoprecipitation and in vitro protein pull-down experiments with HeLa
cell nuclear extracts, they confirmed a direct interaction between PCNA
and WSTF that did not require DNA. The complex containing PCNA was
distinct from the WSTF-including nucleosome assembly complex (WINAC).
Poot et al. (2004) found that PCNA targeted WSTF to DNA replication
foci, and WSTF, in turn, recruited SNF2H (SMARCA5; 603375) to
replication sites. RNA interference-mediated depletion of WSTF or SNF2H
caused compaction of newly replicated chromatin and increased the amount
of heterochromatin markers.

In yeast, chromatid cohesion is essential for viability and is triggered
by the conserved protein Eco1. Moldovan et al. (2006) found that yeast
Eco1 and its human homolog, ESCO2 (609353), interacted directly with
PCNA via a conserved PIP box variant in their N termini. Yeast Eco1
mutants deficient in Eco1-Pcna interaction were defective in chromatid
cohesion and inviable. Moldovan et al. (2006) concluded that PCNA is
crucially involved in the establishment of cohesion in S phase.

Maga et al. (2007) analyzed the effects of human PCNA and replication
protein A (RPA; 179835) on 6 different human DNA polymerases belonging
to the B, Y, and X classes during in vitro bypass of different lesions.
The mutagenic lesion 8-oxo-guanine has high miscoding potential. A major
and specific effect was found for 8-oxo-G bypass with DNA pol-lambda
(606343) and -eta (603968). PCNA and RPA allowed correct incorporation
of dCTP opposite an 8-oxo-G template 1,200-fold more efficiently than
the incorrect dATP by DNA pol-lambda, and 68-fold by DNA pol-eta,
respectively. Experiments with DNA pol-gamma (174763)-null cell extracts
suggested an important role for DNA pol-lambda. On the other hand, DNA
pol-iota (605252) together with DNA pol-alpha (312040), -delta (174761),
and -beta (174760), showed a much lower correct bypass efficiency. Maga
et al. (2007) concluded that their findings showed the existence of an
accurate mechanism to reduce the deleterious consequences of oxidative
damage and, in addition, pointed to an important role for PCNA and RPA
in determining a functional hierarchy among different DNA pols in lesion
bypass.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bowman et al. (2004) reported the crystal structure of the 5-protein
clamp loader complex (replication factor-C, RFC; see 102579) of the
yeast S. cerevisiae, bound to the sliding clamp (PCNA). Tight
interfacial coordination of the ATP analog ATP-gamma-S by RFC resulted
in a spiral arrangement of the ATPase domains of the clamp loader above
the PCNA ring. Placement of a model for primed DNA within the central
hole of PCNA revealed a striking correspondence between the RFC spiral
and the grooves of the DNA double helix. Bowman et al. (2004) concluded
that this model, in which the clamp loader complex locks into primed DNA
in a screwcap-like arrangement, provides a simple explanation for the
process by which the engagement of primer-template junctions by the
RFC:PCNA complex results in ATP hydrolysis and release of the sliding
clamp on DNA.

GENE STRUCTURE

Travali et al. (1989) showed that the human PCNA gene is present in
single copy and has 6 exons. It spans 4,961 bp, from the cap site to the
poly(A) signal. An unusual feature was the presence of extensive
sequence similarities among introns and between introns and exons.

MAPPING

Ku et al. (1989) mapped the PCNA gene to chromosome 20 by Southern
analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNA. Two pseudogenes were identified,
one mapping to Xpter-q13 and a second mapping to 6pter-p12. By in situ
hybridization, Webb et al. (1990) assigned the locus to 20p13. They also
found 2 strong secondary peaks of grains over 11p15.1 and Xp11.4. From
studies by in situ hybridization, Rao et al. (1991) concluded that the
PCNA gene is located at or close to 20p12.

- PSEUDOGENES

Taniguchi et al. (1996) characterized 2 'new' PCNA pseudogenes that are
tandemly localized on 4q24. One is a pseudogene and the other is a
truncated pseudogene.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene encodes a
deduced 433-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

Chen and Giblett (1976) and Pearce et al. (1976) presented evidence for
3 enolase loci. By in situ hybridization studies using a probe for ENO2
(131360), Craig et al. (1989) found small aggregates of grains at
1pter-p36, the site of ENO1 (172430), and some at 17pter-p12.

Feo et al. (1990) mapped the muscle-specific beta-enolase (ENO3) to
chromosome 17pter-p11 by analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids
and transfectant cell lines carrying different portions of chromosome
17. This muscle-specific enzyme maps to the region encoding the gene
cluster for the sarcomeric myosin heavy chains (MYH1; 160730).

GENE STRUCTURE

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene contains 12
exons and spans approximately 6 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a man with glycogen storage disease XIII (GSD13; 612932), Comi et al.
(2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ENO3
gene (G156D, 131370.0001; G374E, 131370.0002). Immunohistochemistry and
immunoblotting detected dramatically reduced beta-enolase protein in
this patient, while alpha-enolase was normally represented.
