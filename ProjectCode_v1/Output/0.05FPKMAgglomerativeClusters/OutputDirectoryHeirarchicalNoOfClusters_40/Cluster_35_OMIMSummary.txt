CENEXIN 1, INCLUDED;;
CENEXIN 1 VARIANT 1, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ODF2 encodes multiple protein isoforms that have roles in the formation
of primary cilia and sperm flagella and in coordinating ciliary beating
(Kunimoto et al., 2012).

CLONING

See ODF1 (182878). Brohmann et al. (1997) used antibodies against Odf
proteins to screen a rat testis expression library and isolated the rat
Odf2 gene. Sequence analysis revealed that the protein has an overall
alpha-helical structure with 2 regions identical to the dimerization
region of a leucine zipper motif. Brohmann et al. (1997) documented Odf2
cDNAs with 3 different 5-prime end sequences, presumed to be the result
of alternative splicing. They found expression of the rat gene only in
testis.

The EST database contains several human cDNA sequences which are closely
related to rat Odf2, suggesting that a human homolog exists (Scott,
1997). These human cDNA sequences were derived from testis, epididymis,
and fetal brain libraries.

Shao et al. (1997) used a yeast 2-hybrid screening with the leucine
zipper region of ODF1 (ODF27; Shao and van der Hoorn, 1996) as bait to
isolate rat testis-specific proteins that could interact with ODF27.
They demonstrated that one of the novel genes isolated encoded the 84-kD
ODF protein ODF2.

Soung et al. (2006) stated that the deduced 638-amino acid ODF2 protein
has 2 leucine zipper motifs in its C-terminal half. Using an inactive
mutant of the mitotic kinase PLK1 (602098) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a human testis cDNA library, followed by RT-PCR of HeLa cell
RNA, they identified 2 splice variants of ODF2 that they called
cenexin-1 and cenexin-1 variant-1. Cenexin-1 and cenexin-1 variant-1
encode proteins of 805 and 824 amino acids, respectively. Both isoforms
contain a C-terminal extension compared with ODF2, and cenexin-1
variant-1 also has a 19-amino acid insertion near its N-terminal end.
Northern blot analysis of synchronized HeLa cells detected a single
transcript of about 4.0 kb, representing cenexin-1. Cenexin-1 localized
at the microtubule-organizing center in interphase and at spindle poles
in mitosis, suggesting that cenexin-1 is a centrosomal protein.
Fluorescence-tagged cenexin-1 primarily localized to the mother
centrosome in interphase and to both mother and daughter centrosomes in
mitosis.

Using real-time RT-PCR with a probe for the 3-prime region of mouse
Odf2/cenexin, Kunimoto et al. (2012) detected highest expression in
mouse trachea and lung, with much lower expression in brain, and little
to no expression in heart, liver, and kidney. Western blot analysis
using an antibody against the N-terminal region of Odf2/cenexin detected
an apparent 75-kD protein in mouse testis and an apparent 90-kD protein
in mouse trachea, lung, kidney, brain, and oviduct.

GENE STRUCTURE

Soung et al. (2006) determined that the ODF2 gene contains 21 exons and
spans 44.8 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Shao et al. (1998) mapped the human ODF2 gene to chromosome
9q34. Soung et al. (2006) mapped the ODF2 gene to chromosome 9q34.11 by
genomic sequence analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Soung et al.
(2006) confirmed that cenexin-1 interacted directly with PLK1. Mutation
analysis revealed that the C-terminal domain of cenexin-1 interacted
with the polo-box domain of PLK1. The C-terminal domain of cenexin-1 was
also required to recruit PLK1 to centrosomes. Depletion of cenexin-1
from HeLa cells delocalized centrosomal PLK1, diminished gamma-tubulin
(see 191135) recruitment to centrosomes, and altered localization of a
subset of centrosomal proteins required for microtubule nucleation and
function. Depletion of cenexin-1 also resulted in severe mitotic
defects, including chromosome alignment and segregation defects. A
significant fraction of these cells also showed multipolar chromosomes
and apoptotic cell death.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kunimoto et al. (2012) developed a line of mice with deletion of exons 6
and 7 of Odf2, which they called Odf2(delta-ex6,7) mice. Homozygous
Odf2(delta-ex6,7) mice were born at the expected mendelian ratio, but
only 20% survived past weaning. Surviving mice were characterized by a
coughing/sneezing-like phenotype, sinusitis, otitis media, and a slight
tendency to hydrocephaly, suggesting primary ciliary dyskinesia. Unlike
Odf2 -/- F9 embryonic mouse carcinoma cells, homozygous
Odf2(delta-ex6,7) mice were born with primary cilia and expressed low
levels of N-terminally truncated Odf2/cenexin. Antibody raised against
the Odf2/cenexin C-terminal region detected slight immunofluorescence at
the base of cilia in homozygous Odf2(delta-ex6,7) tracheal cells, but
not in Odf2 -/- F9 cells. Cilium appeared to nucleate from the basal
body in Odf2(delta-ex6,7) cells, but the basal foot was completely lost,
and basal bodies failed to position apically in some cells. Basal feet
were also absent in oviduct epithelial cells and ependymal cells in
brains of homozygous Odf2(delta-ex6,7) mice. Live imaging of isolated
Odf2(delta-ex6,7) trachea preparations revealed uncoordinated ciliary
beating and inefficient fluid flow across the luminal surface.
Deficiency of full-length Odf2/cenexin also perturbed the polarized
distribution of planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins and PCP-dependent
apical organization of microtubules.

613249	TITLE *613249 ENDOGENOUS BORNA-LIKE N ELEMENT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; EBLN1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Borna disease viruses (BDVs), a genus of nonsegmented negative-sense RNA
viruses, are unique among RNA viruses in that they establish persistent
infection in the cell nucleus. By searching human protein databases for
sequences similar to BDV proteins, Horie et al. (2010) identified a
hypothetical human protein, LOC340900, with significant sequence
similarity to the BDV nucleoprotein gene (BDV-N), which encodes a major
structural protein that tightly encapsidates the viral RNA to form the
nucleocapsid. The 366-residue LOC340900 sequence shares 41% sequence
identity and 58% similarity to the 370-residue BDV-N protein. Sequence
alignment of transcription regulatory elements demonstrated that the S
and T motifs in flanking sequences of the human protein were well
conserved with those of BDV. Homology of LOC340900 to BDV-N was also
confirmed by a permutation test. Because of findings indicating that
LOC340900 may represent an endogenous element related to the BDV-N gene,
Horie et al. (2010) designated the human gene EBLN1. The EBLN1 protein
shares 72% identity with the EBLN2 protein (613250). Horie et al. (2010)
showed that elements homologous to the BDV-N gene exist in the genomes
of several other mammalian species, including nonhuman primates,
rodents, and elephants. Horie et al. (2010) concluded that their results
provided the first evidence for endogenization of nonretroviral
virus-derived elements in mammalian genomes, and further suggested that
the L1 reverse transcriptase is used to promote the endogenization of
EBLN elements, which may still be occurring.

123857	TITLE *123857 CYSTATIN 4; CST4
;;CYSTATIN S
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

See CST1 (123855) and CST5 (123858) for general information about
cystatins, inhibitors of cysteine proteinases. Saitoh et al. (1991)
cloned the CST4 gene by screening a genomic library with the CST1 gene.
The CST4 gene encodes the 141-amino acid precursor form of cystatin S.
(The cystatin D gene was originally called CST4 but later renamed CST5.)

By RNase protection assay of 23 human tissues, Dickinson et al. (2002)
found that the level of CST4 was highest in submandibular gland,
intermediate in parotid gland, lacrimal gland, and gallbladder, lower in
kidney and seminal vesicles, and lowest in prostate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Saitoh et al. (1991) determined that the CST4 gene is composed of 3
exons spanning less than 4 kb.

MAPPING

Dickinson et al. (1994) mapped the CST4 gene to 20p11.2 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization. CST4 is clustered with other family II cystatins
in a region that spans less than 905 kb.

606538	TITLE *606538 MYOSIN IC; MYO1C
;;MYOSIN 2, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; MYR2;;
NUCLEAR MYOSIN I; NMI
DESCRIPTION Myosins are molecular motors that, upon interaction with actin
filaments, utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate mechanical
force. For further background information on myosins, see MYO1A
(601478).

CLONING

By screening a kidney cDNA library with a mouse Myo1c probe, Crozet et
al. (1997) obtained a human cDNA encoding MYO1C. The deduced 1,028-amino
acid protein, which is 96% identical to the mouse protein, contains ATP-
and actin-binding sequences in the motor (or head) domain, followed by
three 23-residue IQ motifs and a tail domain rich in basic residues that
is expected to interact with negatively charged membrane phospholipids.
Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of Myo1c in adult
mouse tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

MYO1C, also known as myosin I-beta and MYR2, was thought to mediate the
slow component of adaptation by hair cells, the sensory cells of the
inner ear. To test this hypothesis, Holt et al. (2002) mutated tyr61 of
MYO1C to gly, conferring susceptibility to inhibition by N6-modified ADP
analogs. They expressed the mutant MYO1C in utricular hair cells of
transgenic mice, delivered an ADP analog through a whole-cell recording
pipette, and found that the analog rapidly blocked adaptation to
positive and negative deflections in transgenic cells but not in
wildtype cells. The speed and specificity of inhibition suggested that
MYO1C participates in adaptation in hair cells.

Bose et al. (2002) reported that the unconventional myosin MYO1C is
present in GLUT4 (138190)-containing vesicles purified from 3T3-L1
adipocytes. MYO1C is highly expressed in primary and cultured
adipocytes. Insulin (176730) enhances the localization of MYO1C with
GLUT4 in cortical tubulovesicular structures associated with actin
filaments, and this colocalization is insensitive to wortmannin.
Insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the adipocyte plasma
membrane is augmented by the expression of wildtype MYO1C and inhibited
by a dominant-negative cargo domain of MYO1C. A decrease in the
expression of endogenous MYO1C mediated by small interfering RNAs
inhibited insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. Thus, Bose et al.
(2002) concluded that MYO1C functions in a
phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase (PI3K; see 601232)-independent
insulin signaling pathway that controls the movement of intracellular
GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane.

MAPPING

Using PCR and radiation hybrid analysis, Crozet et al. (1997) mapped the
MYO1C gene to 17p13.

HISTORY

A report by Nunez et al. (2008) indicating that 3-dimensional
motor-dependent interchromosomal interactions involving MYO1C are

target genes was retracted.

610594	TITLE *610594 FOLLICULIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; FNIP1
;;KIAA1961
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones derived from an adult brain cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (2001) cloned FNIP1, which they designated KIAA1961.
RT-PCR ELISA detected ubiquitous expression in all human adult and fetal
tissues and specific brain regions examined, with highest expression in
spleen, testis, ovary, and adult and fetal liver.

Using coimmunoprecipitation with HA-tagged folliculin (FLCN; 607273)
expressed in HEK293 cells to identify FLCN-interacting proteins,
followed by mass spectrometry and database analysis, and PCR of a pooled
human tissue cDNA library, Baba et al. (2006) isolated full-length
FNIP1. The deduced 1,166-amino acid protein has no known functional
domains. Expression of FNIP1 in HEK293 cells yielded a protein that
migrated at 130 kD on SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis detected
strongest expression in heart, liver, and placenta with moderate
expression in kidney and lung.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Hasumi et al. (2008) detected variable
FNIP1 expression in most human tissues. Highest expression was in
salivary gland, nasal mucosa, parathyroid gland, and muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation of FNIP1 and FLCN expressed in HEK293 cells
and in vitro binding assays, Baba et al. (2006) showed that the C
terminus of FLCN and amino acids 300 to 1166 of FNIP1 were required for
optimal FLCN-FNIP1 binding. FLCN and FNIP1 colocalized to the cytoplasm
in a reticular pattern. FNIP1 interacted with HSP90 (HSPCA; 140571) and
with the alpha (PRKAA1; 602739), beta (PRKAB1; 602740), and gamma
(PRKAG1; 602742) subunits of AMPK. FNIP1 was phosphorylated by AMPK, and
its phosphorylation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by an AMPK
inhibitor, resulting in reduced FNIP1 expression. FLCN phosphorylation
was diminished by rapamycin and amino acid starvation and facilitated by
FNIP1 overexpression, suggesting that FLCN phosphorylation may be
regulated by mTOR (FRAP1; 601231) and AMPK signaling. Baba et al. (2006)
concluded that FLCN and FNIP1 may be involved in energy and/or nutrient
sensing through the AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways.

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis with HEK293 cells, Hasumi et al.
(2008) detected FNIP2 (612768) in protein complexes with FNIP1, FLCN,
and AMPK. FNIP1 and FNIP2 formed homo- and heterodimers.

Takagi et al. (2008) found that, when expressed alone, FLCN localized to
the nucleus, but when coexpressed with FNIP1 or FNIP2, the coexpressed
proteins localized to the cytoplasm in a reticular pattern.
Downregulation of FLCN, FNIP1, or FNIP2 via small interfering RNA
resulted in decreased S6K1 (RPS6KB1; 608938) phosphorylation, suggesting
that the FLCN complex regulates S6K1 phosphorylation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Baba et al. (2006) determined that the FNIP1 gene contains 18 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the FNIP1 gene
to chromosome 5.

603110	TITLE *603110 MOTHERS AGAINST DECAPENTAPLEGIC, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 5; SMAD5
;;MADH5;;
SMA- AND MAD-RELATED PROTEIN 5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Drosophila Mad transduces signals from TGF-beta (e.g., 190180) family
members. By searching an expressed sequence tag (EST) database with the
protein sequences of Mad and Mad homologs, Riggins et al. (1996)
isolated partial human cDNAs encoding MADH5, which they called JV5-1.
The deduced MADH5 protein has 465 amino acids, with 57 of the C-terminal
59 residues identical to those of Mad.

Gemma et al. (1998) determined the full-length cDNA sequence of human
MADH5, which they called SMAD5. Using PCR-SSCP analysis to investigate
the frequency of SMAD5 somatic mutations in human cancers, Gemma et al.
(1998) did not detect either homozygous deletions or point mutations in
40 primary gastric tumors or 51 cell lines derived from diverse types of
cancer, including 20 cell lines resistant to the growth inhibitory
effects of TGF-beta. The SMAD5 protein has strong homology with SMAD1
(601595), SMAD2 (601366), SMAD3 (603109), and SMAD4 (600993) in the N-
and C-terminal domains, which are separated by a proline-rich sequence;
SMAD5 shows the greatest homology to SMAD1.

GENE FUNCTION

Bruno et al. (1998) showed that SMAD5 plays a critical role in the
signaling pathway by which TGF-beta inhibits the proliferation of human
hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta and bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs; see 112264) is mediated by miR21 (611020).
miR21 downregulates PDCD4 (608610), which in turn acts as a negative
regulator of smooth muscle contractile genes. TGF-beta and BMP signaling
promoted a rapid increase in expression of mature miR21 through a
posttranscriptional step, promoting the processing of primary
transcripts of miR21 (pri-miR21) into precursor miR21 (pre-miR21) by the
Drosha complex (see 608828). TGF-beta and BMP-specific SMAD signal
transducers SMAD1, SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD5 (603110) are recruited to
pri-miR21 in a complex with the RNA helicase p68 (DDX5; 180630), a
component of the Drosha microprocessor complex. The shared cofactor
SMAD4 (600993) is not required for this process. Thus, Davis et al.
(2008) concluded that regulation of microRNA biogenesis by
ligand-specific SMAD proteins is critical for control of the vascular
smooth muscle cell phenotype and potentially for SMAD4-independent
responses mediated by the TGF-beta and BMP signaling pathways.

GENE STRUCTURE

By comparison of the SMAD5 cDNA sequence with the SMAD5 genomic
sequence, obtained from YAC clones, Gemma et al. (1998) showed that the
SMAD5 gene has 8 exons, with the coding sequence contained in exons 3 to
8. By 5-prime RACE, the authors identified a SMAD5 cDNA derived from an
alternatively spliced transcript that lacks the 75-bp exon 2.

MAPPING

Riggins et al. (1996) mapped the MADH5 gene to 5q31 by somatic cell
hybrid analysis and screening of YAC clones.
