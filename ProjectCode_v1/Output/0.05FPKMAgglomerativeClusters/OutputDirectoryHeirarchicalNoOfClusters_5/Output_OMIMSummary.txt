CLONING

Kao et al. (1994) cloned cDNAs encoding NF45 and NF90. The NF90 gene
encodes a 671-amino acid polypeptide with limited similarity to several
RNA-binding proteins. The NF90 gene also appears to encode an
alternatively spliced 404-amino acid polypeptide, of which the first 394
amino acids are identical to the longer clone. Northern and Western blot
analysis demonstrated NF45 and NF90 expression in several cell types,
including both unstimulated and stimulated Jurkat T cells.

By immunoscreening a HeLa cell cDNA library for phosphoproteins,
Matsumoto-Taniura et al. (1996) isolated a partial cDNA encoding ILF3,
which they termed MPP4. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that MPP4
encodes 90- and 110-kD proteins. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated cytoplasmic expression during M phase and nuclear/nucleolar
expression during interphase.

Patel et al. (1999) purified double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding
proteins from HeLa cell extracts and microsequenced a 90-kD protein with
identity to MPP4 in its N terminus. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with a
mutant RNA-activated protein kinase (PRKR; 176871) as bait, followed by
RT-PCR, they isolated a full-length cDNA encoding ILF3, which they
called DRBP76. Sequence analysis predicted that the 702-amino acid
protein has a bipartite nuclear localization signal, 2 dsRNA-binding
domains, an RG2 domain, and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a 90-kD protein, larger than the
calculated 76 kD. EMSA analysis confirmed the dsRNA binding activity of
DRBP76. Autoradiographic analysis indicated that DRBP76 is
phosphorylated by PRKR.

Langland et al. (1999) noted that NF90 is primarily localized to
ribosomes.

Saunders et al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding DRBP76, which they
termed NFAR1, as well as a variant cDNA encoding a 110-kD, 894-amino
acid protein they designated NFAR2. Sequence analysis showed that the
NFAR proteins share homology with a known PRKR substrate, the
translation initiation factor EIF2S1 (603907). Northern blot analysis
revealed ubiquitous expression of multiple transcripts ranging from 4.0
to 8.0 kb. Immunoblot analysis indicated variable expression with lower
amounts particularly notable in liver and spleen, suggesting
differential regulation at the translational or posttranslational level.
Immunoblot analysis and confocal microscopy demonstrated that PRKR and
both NFAR variants reciprocally coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize in
the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated an association with
spliceosomes.

Viranaicken et al. (2006) identified splice variants of human and mouse
ILF3 that encode long and short isoforms of the ILF3 and NF90 proteins
via inclusion or exclusion of 13 N-terminal residues, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Kao et al. (1994) showed that the NF45 and NF90 proteins form an NFAT
DNA-binding activity that is enhanced by T-cell stimulation and
inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506.

Functional analysis by Saunders et al. (2001) indicated that both NFAR
proteins regulate gene transcription, probably at the level of mRNA
elongation. NFAR2 exhibited potent, constitutive regulatory activity
through its unique C-terminal region, which specifically interacted with
FUS (137070) and SMN1 (600354). Saunders et al. (2001) concluded that
NFARs facilitate dsRNA-regulated gene expression at the level of
posttranscription.

Shim et al. (2002) showed that NF90 binds to a subregion of the 3-prime
untranslated region that contains several AU-rich elements (AREs) and
slows down the degradation of IL2 (147680) mRNA. In nonstimulated cells,
NF90 was mostly nuclear, but T-cell activation resulted in its
accumulation in the cytoplasm. The authors concluded that nuclear export
of NF90 is required for IL2 mRNA stabilization.

Pfeifer et al. (2008) found that NFAR1 and NFAR2 were involved in
retaining cellular transcripts in intranuclear foci and could regulate
mRNA export to the cytoplasm. They also remained associated with
exported ribonucleoprotein complexes. Treatment of HeLa cells with small
interfering RNA to NFAR1 and/or NFAR2 resulted in an increase in protein
synthesis rates, particularly in the presence the mRNA export factors
TAP (NXF1; 602647), p15 (NXT1; 605811), or RAE1 (603343). Depletion of
NFAR in mouse fibroblasts or HeLa cells dramatically increased their
susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis virus or influenza virus,
respectively. Pfeifer et al. (2008) concluded that NFAR1 and NFAR2 are
retained on polyribosomes and act to govern translation rates, and that
they also play a role in innate immune defense to virus infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Saunders et al. (2001) determined that the
NFAR gene contains 21 exons and spans 16.2 kb. The 90-kD NFAR1 variant
expresses exon 18, which contains several stop codons that lead to
termination at amino acid 702. The 110-kD NFAR2 variant lacks exon 18
but contains exons 19, 20, and 21.

Viranaicken et al. (2006) identified an additional alternatively spliced
exon within intron 2 of the mouse and human ILF3 genes, increasing the
total number of exons to 22.

MAPPING

Saunders et al. (2001) mapped the NFAR gene to chromosome 19p13 by FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pfeifer et al. (2008) found that mice lacking Nfar died in utero.

;;XPCC GENE;;
RAD4, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; RAD4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The XPC gene encodes a protein that functions as a damage detector
involved in the first step of global genome nucleotide excision DNA
repair (Sugasawa et al. (1998); Volker et al., 2001).

CLONING

Teitz et al. (1987) were able to correct UV sensitivity in a xeroderma
pigmentosum group C (XPC; 278720) cell line by transfection with a human
cDNA library derived from fibroblasts. UV resistance appeared to be
closely linked to resistance to G418, an antibiotic. The authors
suggested the gene symbol XPCC (for xeroderma pigmentosum group
C-complementing).

Peterson and Legerski (1991) devised a simple, highly efficient cDNA
expression system for use in human cells. Legerski and Peterson (1992)
used this system to isolate a cDNA clone that restored the ultraviolet
sensitivity and unscheduled DNA synthesis of XPC cells to normal levels.
The cloned XPC gene was found to encode a highly hydrophilic protein
composed of a predicted 823 amino acids and sharing limited homology
with the product of the yeast DNA repair gene RAD4. The XPC transcript
was undetectable by Northern blotting in most XPC cell lines examined.

MAPPING

Legerski et al. (1994) mapped the XPC gene to chromosome 3p25 by somatic
cell hybridization. Although it is closely linked to the RAD23B gene
(600062) in the human, the mouse homolog of RAD23B maps to chromosome 4
and the mouse homolog of XPC maps to chromosome 6 (van der Spek et al.,
1996). The physical disconnection of the genes in the mouse argues
against a functional significance of the colocalization of these genes
in the human.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, van der Spek et al. (1994) showed
that the XPC and HHR23B (600062) genes, the products of which form a
tight complex, colocalize to chromosome 3p25.1. Pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis revealed that the 2 genes may share a MluI restriction
fragment of about 625 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Masutani et al. (1994) reported the purification to homogeneity and
subsequent cDNA cloning of a repair complex by in vitro complementation
of the XPC defect in a cell-free repair system containing UV-damaged
SV40 minichromosomes. The complex had a high affinity for
single-stranded DNA and consisted of 2 tightly associated proteins of
125 and 58 kD. The 125-kD subunit was an N-terminally extended version
of the XPC gene product, which is thought to represent the human homolog
of the RAD4 nucleotide excision repair (NER) gene of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. The 58-kD species turned out to be a human homolog of yeast
RAD23. Unexpectedly, a second human counterpart of RAD23 was identified.
Masutani et al. (1994) referred to the 2 as HHR23A (600061) and HHR23B
(600062). The 2 RAD23 homologs were expressed in the same cells.
However, only the HHR23B protein was found in a complex with p125/XPC.
Masutani et al. (1994) pointed out that no human mutant defective in
HHR23A had been identified.

The XPC-HHR23B complex is specifically involved in global genome but not
transcription-coupled NER. Using a DNA damage recognition-competition
assay, Sugasawa et al. (1998) identified XPC-HHR23B as the earliest
damage detector to initiate NER; it acts before the known damage-binding
protein XPA (611153). Coimmunoprecipitation and DNase I footprinting
showed that XPC-HHR23B binds to a variety of NER lesions. This provides
a plausible explanation for the extreme damage specificity exhibited by
global genome repair.

Volker et al. (2001) described the assembly of the NER complex in normal
and repair-deficient (xeroderma pigmentosum) human cells by employing a
novel technique of local ultraviolet irradiation combined with
fluorescent antibody labeling. The damage-recognition complex XPC-HR23B
appeared to be essential for the recruitment of all subsequent NER
factors in the preincision complex, including transcription repair
factor TFIIH (see 189972). Volker et al. (2001) found that XPA
associates relatively late, is required for anchoring of ERCC1
(126380)-XPF (133520), and may be essential for activation of the
endonuclease activity of XPG (133530). These findings identified XPC as
the earliest known NER factor in the reaction mechanism, gave insight
into the order of subsequent NER components, provided evidence for a
dual role of XPA, and supported a concept of sequential assembly of
repair proteins at the site of damage rather than a preassembled
repairosome.

Shimizu et al. (2003) presented evidence that human and mouse XPC-HR23B
complexes interact with thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG; 601423), which
initiates base excision repair of G/T mismatches. XPC-HR23B stimulated
TDG activity by promoting the release of TDG following the excision of
mismatched T bases. In the presence of apurinic/apyrimidinic
endonuclease (APEX; 107748), XPC-HR23B had an additive effect on TDG
turnover without significantly inhibiting the subsequent action of APEX.
Shimizu et al. (2003) concluded that the XPC-HR23B complex contributes
to the suppression of spontaneous mutations and that compromised
function in XPC patients may promote carcinogenesis.

In studies of the contribution of the XPC gene to DNA repair, Emmert et
al. (2000) found that the gene leads to selective repair of cyclobutane
pyrimidine dimers (CPD) rather than 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PP).
Increasing XPC gene expression in vivo led to selective repair of CPD in
the global genome. Undetectable XPC protein was associated with no
repair of CPD or 6-4PP, detectable but subnormal XPC protein levels
reconstituted CPD but not 6-4PP repair, and normal XPC protein levels
fully reconstituted both CPD and 6-4PP repair.

Using sequence profile analysis, Anantharaman et al. (2001) showed that
RAD4/XPC proteins contain the ancient transglutaminase fold and are
specifically related to the peptide-N-glycanases (PNGases) which remove
glycans from glycoproteins during their degradation (Suzuki et al.,
2000). The PNGases retain the catalytic triad that is typical of this
fold and are predicted to have a reaction mechanism similar to that
involved in transglutamination. In contrast, the RAD4/XPC proteins are
predicted to be inactive and are likely to possess only the protein
interaction function in DNA repair. These proteins also contain a long,
low-complexity insert in the globular transglutaminase domain.
Anantharaman et al. (2001) hypothesized that the RAD4/XPC proteins,
along with other inactive transglutaminase-fold proteins, represent a
case of functional reassignment of an ancient domain following the loss
of the ancestral enzymatic activity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Min and Pavletich (2007) presented the crystal structure of the yeast
XPC ortholog Rad4 bound to DNA containing a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer
(CPD) lesion. The structure showed that Rad4 inserts a beta-hairpin
through the DNA duplex, causing the 2 damaged basepairs to flip out of
the double helix. The expelled nucleotides of the undamaged strand are
recognized by Rad4, whereas the 2 CPD-linked nucleotides become
disordered. Min and Pavletich (2007) concluded that the lesions
recognized by Rad4/XPC thermodynamically destablize the Watson-Crick
double helix in a manner that facilitates the flipping out of 2
basepairs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Li et al. (1993) identified changes in the XPC gene (see, e.g.,
613208.0001-613208.0004) in 5 XPC cell lines. In 4 of them, Northern
blot analysis of RNAs demonstrated subnormal levels of the XPC
transcript, whereas the fifth exhibited a near normal level. Four of the
5 mutations resulted in a truncated protein, and there was a correlation
between the degree to which the protein was truncated and the repair
defect at the cellular level.

In affected members of 2 unrelated but consanguineous Turkish families
with XPC, Khan et al. (2004) identified 2 different splice site
mutations in the XPC gene (613208.0008 and 613208.0009), respectively.
RT-PCR of cells from the severely affected patients showed a short mRNA
band and no detectable wildtype band. In contrast, cells from the more
mildly affected patients had an mRNA band of shorter size and 1 of
normal size.

Cleaver et al. (1999) reviewed mutations in the XPC gene.

In affected members of 14 Tunisian families with XPC, Ben Rekaya et al.
(2009) identified the same homozygous 2-bp deletion (1744delTG;
613208.0010) in the XPC gene. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder
effect.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sands et al. (1995) generated XPC-deficient mice by 'knockout' of the
mouse homolog of the human XPC gene using embryonic stem cell
technology. Mice homozygous for mutant alleles were viable and did not
exhibit an increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumor generation at 1
year of age. However, they were found to be highly susceptible to
ultraviolet-induced carcinogenesis compared to mice heterozygous for the
mutant allele and to wildtype controls. Homozygous mutant mice also
displayed a spectrum of ultraviolet exposure-related pathologic skin and
eye changes consistent with those found in the human disease xeroderma
pigmentosum group C. The deficient mice showed marked hyperplasia of the
epidermis with focal areas of hyperkeratosis in varying degrees of
dysplasia, acantholysis, and/or dyskeratosis, similar to the human
lesions known as actinic or solar keratosis. Changes in the eye included
severe keratitis and corneal ulceration.

Cheo et al. (1999) studied the XPC -/- mouse to determine whether there
is a predisposition to cancers in noncutaneous tissues associated with
exposure to environmental carcinogens. They observed a significantly
higher incidence of chemically-induced liver and lung tumors in these
mice, compared with normal and heterozygous littermates, using
2-acetylaminofluorene and NOH-2-acetylaminofluorene. In addition, the
progression of liver tumors in the mice homozygous mutant for XPC and
heterozygous mutant for p53 was accelerated, compared with the
homozygous mutant XPC mice and homozygous wildtype p53 animals. They
also demonstrated a higher incidence of spontaneous testicular tumors in
XPC -/- p53 -/- double mutant mice, compared with mice homozygous for
mutation only at the p53 locus.

Hollander et al. (2005) found that 100% of Xpc -/- mice developed
multiple spontaneous lung tumors with a minority progressing to nonsmall
cell lung adenocarcinoma, occasionally with metastasis to adjacent lymph
nodes.

XPC, PRO218HIS

In XPC (278720) cell line XP1MI, Li et al. (1993) identified a mutation
in the XPC gene, resulting in a pro218-to-his (P218H) substitution. The
finding suggested that the cell line was either homozygous or hemizygous
for this mutation. The XP1MI cell line was the most UV-sensitive of 5
cell lines analyzed by Li et al. (1993). Furthermore, the patient
demonstrated XP-associated neurologic abnormalities, a rarity in group
C.

XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, 83-BP INS, NT462

In XPC (278720) cell line XP3BE-L3, Li et al. (1993) identified an 83-bp
insertion beginning at position 462 in the XPC cDNA, predicted to result
in premature termination.

.0003
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, 3-BP INS, GGT, CODON 580 AND LYS822GLN

In XPC (278720) cell line XP8BE-L1, Li et al. (1993) identified 2
mutations in the XPC gene: 1 was a 3-bp insertion (GGT) that resulted in
the insertion of a valine residue after val580, and the other was a
point mutation that created a nonconservative amino acid change near the
carboxyl terminus of the protein (lys822-to-gln; K822Q). The mutation
was either homo- or hemizygous. It could not be determined whether only
1 or both of these mutations was responsible for the observed repair
deficiency. Of the 5 cell lines examined, XP8BE-L1 was the least
sensitive to UV irradiation and exhibited a near-normal level of XPC
mRNA. Clinically, the patient XP8BE was diagnosed with XP at birth and
was rigorously protected from sunlight from that time; as of 13 years of
age, the patient had not exhibited any malignant neoplasms. However, an
older brother with XP began to develop tumors by age 13. Like the vast
majority of XPC patients, this patient did not exhibit neurologic
complications.

XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, 2-BP DEL, 1132AA

In XPC (278720) cell line XP1BE-L1, Li et al. (1993) identified a 2-bp
deletion (1132delA) in the XPC gene, predicted to result in premature
termination of the protein by a new stop codon 15 nucleotides
downstream. The deletion appeared to be either homozygous or hemizygous.

XPC, IVS9DS, T-G, +2

In a 4-year-old boy of Korean ancestry who had xeroderma pigmentosum
type C (278720) characterized by sun sensitivity and multiple cutaneous
neoplasms, Khan et al. (1998) found a T-to-G transversion at the splice
donor site of exon 9 of the XPC gene. The patient had some unusual
neurologic features, including the inability to speak, hyperactivity,
and autistic features. There was a markedly decreased level of XPC mRNA,
and the splice site mutation was found to generate 3 different isoforms:
1 with loss of exon 9, resulting in premature termination; another with
an insertion of exons 9a and 9b; and a third with a deletion of exon 9
and insertion of exon 9a. The exon 9a insertion was located in intron 9
and was flanked by strong splice donor and acceptor sequences. Analysis
of the patient's blood showed persistently low levels of glycine (68
microM; normal = 125-318 microM). Normal glycine levels were maintained
with oral glycine supplements, and the patient's hyperactivity
diminished.

.0006
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, 2-BP DEL, 669AT

In 2 Israeli sibs with severe xeroderma pigmentosum type C (278720),
Slor et al. (2000) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion (669delAT) in
exon 5 of the XPC gene predicted to result in a truncated protein.
Cultured skin fibroblasts from both patients showed reductions in
postultraviolet survival (11% of normal), unscheduled DNA synthesis (10%
of normal), global genome DNA repair (15% of normal), and plasmid host
cell reactivation (5% of normal). Transcription-coupled DNA repair was
normal, however. Northern blot analysis revealed greatly reduced
xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C mRNA. Sun protection
delayed the onset of skin cancer and prolonged life in the second sib.

.0007
XERODERMA PIGMENTOSUM, COMPLEMENTATION GROUP C
XPC, ARG579TER

In 2 severely affected Turkish sibs with XPC (278720), a boy with
multiple skin cancers who died at age 10 (XP67TMA) and an 8-year-old
girl who began developing skin cancer before 3 years of age (XP68TMA),
Gozukara et al. (2001) identified a 1840C-T transition in exon 8 of the
XPC gene, resulting in an arg579-to-ter (R579X) substitution. This
change would lead to a truncation of the XPC protein at amino acid 579
rather than at its full length of 940 amino acids. Restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of XPC exon 8 DNA showed that both
affected children were homozygous and both parents were heterozygous for
the mutation, consistent with a history of consanguinity in the family.
This mutation was reported by Chavanne et al. (2000) in an Italian
patient (XP10PV) from Bologna who developed skin cancers beginning at
age 4 years. She had ocular lesions including tumors and died at age 15
years. The parents were not known to be consanguineous. Gozukara et al.
(2001) studied 19 microsatellite markers flanking the XPC gene on
chromosome 3; their results suggested that the XPC allele passed between
Italy and Turkey approximately 300 to 500 years ago. The R579X XPC
allele is thus associated with severe clinical disease with multiple
skin cancers and early death.

XPC, IVS3AS, T-A, -9

In 2 sibs with xeroderma pigmentosum type C (278720) and multiple skin
cancers from a consanguineous Turkish family, Khan et al. (2004)
identified homozygosity for a -9T-A transversion in intron 3 of the XPC
gene. The mutation was located in a splice lariat branchpoint sequence.
PCR analysis of fibroblast cells detected an XPC mRNA isoform with
deletion of exon 4 that had no DNA repair activity in a post-UV host
cell reactivation assay. The 20-year-old male and his 16-year-old sister
were severely affected. They developed skin lesions at 3 years of age.
Both had cutaneous atrophy, telangiectasia, actinic keratoses, and
multiple skin cancers including squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell
carcinomas, and melanomas.

XPC, IVS3AS, A-G, -24

In 3 sibs with mild xeroderma pigmentosum C (278720) from a
consanguineous Turkish family, Khan et al. (2004) identified
homozygosity for a -24A-G transition in intron 3 of the XPC gene. Cells
from the affected sibs produced 3 to 5% normal XPC message and had a
higher level of post-UV host cell reactivation than cells from the
severely affected sibs harboring the -9T-A mutation (613208.0008). The
authors concluded that a small amount of normal XPC mRNA can provide
partial protection against skin cancers. The 3 sisters, aged 20, 18, and
11 years, were mildly affected. Skin lesions began at age 3 to 5 years.
They had freckling but no skin atrophy, telangiectasia, or actinic
keratoses. The oldest sister had a squamous cell carcinoma excised from
her face at age 12 years. The other sisters did not have skin cancer.

XPC, 2-BP DEL, 1744TG

In affected members of 14 Tunisian families with severe XPC (278720),
Ben Rekaya et al. (2009) identified a homozygous 2-bp deletion
(1744delTG) in exon 9 of the XPC gene, resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination (fsTer572). Clinical features included photophobia
and skin tumors, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell
carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. None of the patients had neurologic
abnormalities. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect.

130160	TITLE *130160 ELASTIN; ELN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Elastic fibers are comprised of 2 distinct components, a more abundant
amorphous component (elastin) and the microfibrillar component. Elastin
is composed largely of glycine, proline, and other hydrophobic residues
and contains multiple lysine-derived crosslinks, such as desmosines,
which link the individual polypeptide chains into a rubberlike network.
The hydrophobic regions of the chains between the crosslinks are highly
mobile. The hydrophobic and crosslinking domains are coded by separate,
small (27 to 114 bp) exons that are separated by large introns. The
initial translation product is a 72-kD polypeptide, designated
tropoelastin (Rosenbloom, 1984).

Indik et al. (1987) cloned human elastin cDNA and found that it encodes
a deduced 786-amino acid protein. They described alternative splicing of
elastin mRNA.

Uitto et al. (1991) reviewed the molecular biology of human elastin.
Elastin is initially synthesized as a soluble polypeptide of
approximately 72 kD. The individual elastin molecules are aligned on a
scaffolding of microfibrils composed of fibrillin (134797). This
alignment is stabilized by the formation of intermolecular crosslinks
known as desmosines, which contribute to the insolubility of elastin.
Formation of desmosines is initiated by oxidative deamination of certain
lysyl residues by lysyl oxidase, a copper-dependent enzyme. The elastin
polypeptides are encoded by an mRNA of approximately 3.5 kb which
comprises a 2.2-kb coding segment and a relatively large 1.3-kb, 3-prime
untranslated region.

MAPPING

Emanuel et al. (1985) provisionally assigned the elastin gene to
2q31-qter. Fazio et al. (1991) used human elastin cDNAs in both in situ
hybridization and Southern analysis of human-rodent cell hybrids to map
the elastin gene to 7q11.2. PCR analysis with elastin-specific primers
of DNA from a hybrid cell line containing only human chromosome 7
yielded a product of the expected size, while DNA containing human
chromosome 2, but not chromosome 7, did not result in a product. Foster
et al. (1993) described a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the ELN
gene and used it to confirm assignment to chromosome 7 as well as to
exclude the gene from chromosome 2 by linkage studies.

Wydner et al. (1994) used PCR primers complementary to regions of the
mouse tropoelastin mRNA to define a novel intron length polymorphism
(ILP) within intron 8 of the mouse elastin gene. Using this polymorphism
in an interspecific backcross, they mapped the mouse Eln gene to the
distal half of chromosome 5 in a region of homology of synteny of human
chromosome 7.

GENE STRUCTURE

Indik et al. (1987) found a dearth of coding sequences and a remarkable
abundance of Alu repetitive sequences in the 3-prime region of the human
elastin gene. This suggested to them that, mediated by recombination
between Alu sequences, considerable polymorphism may exist in the human
population and between species. Tromp et al. (1991) identified a RFLP in
the ELN gene.

The human ELN gene has 34 exons and spans a total of approximately 45 kb
of genomic DNA. The exon/intron ratio is unusually low, approximately
1:19 (Uitto et al., 1991).

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1998) defined the role of elastin in arterial development and
disease by generating mice lacking elastin. These mice died of an
obstructive arterial disease that resulted from subendothelial cell
proliferation and reorganization of smooth muscle. These cellular
changes were similar to those seen in atherosclerosis; however, lack of
elastin was not associated with endothelial damage, thrombosis, or
inflammation, which occur in models of atherosclerosis. Hemodynamic
stress was not associated with arterial obstruction in these mice
either, as the disease still occurred in arteries that were isolated in
organ culture and therefore not subject to hemodynamic stress.
Disruption of elastin was enough to induce subendothelial proliferation
of smooth muscle and may contribute to obstructive arterial disease.

To investigate why a loss-of-function mutation in 1 elastin allele
causes an inherited obstructive arterial disease, supravalvular aortic
stenosis, Li et al. (1998) generated mice hemizygous for the elastin
gene (Eln +/-). Although ELN mRNA and protein were reduced by 50% in Eln
+/- mice, arterial compliance at physiologic pressures was nearly
normal. This discrepancy was explained by a paradoxical increase of 35%
in the number of elastic lamellae and smooth muscle in Eln +/- arteries.
Examination of humans with ELN hemizygosity revealed a 2.5-fold increase
in elastic lamellae and smooth muscle. Thus, ELN hemizygosity in mice
and humans induces a compensatory increase in the number of rings of
elastic lamellae and smooth muscle during arterial development. Humans
are exquisitely sensitive to reduced ELN expression, developing profound
arterial thickening and markedly increased risk of obstructive vascular
disease.

Lee et al. (2007) studied the immune responses of age-matched smokers
with and without emphysema (see COPD; 606963) and found that
differential responsiveness of T cells to elastin peptides, but not to
collagen (see COL6A1; 120220) or albumin (ALB; 103600), correlated with
emphysema severity. Compared with controls, COPD patients secreted
increased levels of IFNG (147570) and IL10 (124092) in response to
elastin peptides in an MHC II-dependent manner. Antibody to elastin, but
not to collagen, was also increased in emphysema patients, as were lung
B cells secreting antibody to the protein. Although regulatory T cell
(Treg) responses did not differ between subject and control peripheral
blood cells, emphysema patients showed a significant reduction of lung
Tregs compared with controls. Lee et al. (2007) concluded that
antielastin autoimmunity, possibly resulting from secretion of
proteolytic enzymes induced by cigarette smoke exposure, is associated
with an inflammatory response leading to emphysema and to
tobacco-related pathology in other organs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Role in Williams-Beuren Syndrome

Curran et al. (1993) showed that the ELN gene was disrupted in a
translocation with a breakpoint at 7q11.23. Exon 28 of the gene was the
site of the breakpoint. Furthermore, Ewart et al. (1993) showed close
linkage of ELN and supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS; 185500) in 2
families. Ewart et al. (1993) found that deletion involving 7q11.23 and
resulting in hemizygosity of the elastin gene is responsible for the
Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050). Deletions limited to the elastin
gene appear to result in SVAS, whereas deletions spanning at least 114
kb lead to the Williams syndrome. Thus, the latter is a contiguous gene
syndrome with neurobehavioral features and mental retardation not easily
accounted for by the disruption of the elastin gene alone.

Perez Jurado et al. (1996) reported that 61 of 65 clinically defined
patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome had a deletion of the ELN locus.
They noted that no variability in the size of the deletion could be
detected between WBS patients by genotyping of polymorphic markers,
suggesting that the chromosomal breakpoints in these patients fell into
narrowly defined physical regions. Perez Jurado et al. (1996) also
compared clinical differences between maternally and paternally
inherited ELN deletions and postulated that an imprinted locus, silent
on the paternal chromosome and contributing to statural growth, may be
affected by the deletion.

Duba et al. (2002) investigated a family with a cytogenetically balanced
translocation t(7;16)(q11.23;q13) in which the 5 translocation carriers
manifested a wide variation in phenotype, ranging from a hoarse voice as
the only feature, partial WBS with or without SVAS, to the full WBS
phenotype. DNA sequence analysis showed that the breakpoint on
chromosome 7 was within intron 5 of the ELN gene and on chromosome 16
within intron 1 of the GPR56 gene (604110). In the course of the
rearrangement, no basepair was lost from either the chromosome 7 or
chromosome 16 sequences. Duba et al. (2002) speculated that the expected
phenotype in the reported family would be SVAS, not WBS, and proposed a
long-range position effect caused by the translocation event as the most
likely explanation.

- Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis

In a family with SVAS (185500), Ewart et al. (1994) found, by pulsed
field, PCR, and Southern analysis, a 100-kb deletion of the 3-prime end
of the elastin gene cosegregating with the disease (130160.0001). DNA
sequence analysis localized the breakpoint of the deletion between
elastin exons 27 and 28, the same region disrupted by the
SVAS-associated translocation. The family included an affected mother
and daughter. The daughter had right ventricular hypertrophy,
supravalvular pulmonic stenosis, bilateral narrowing of the pulmonary
arteries (left more severe than right), and a diffusely narrowed
ascending aorta with a discrete supravalvular narrowing diagnosed by
cardiac catheterization at 6 weeks of age. The patient also had
intermittent acrocyanosis and hypertension. At 16 months of age, the
supravalvular pulmonic stenosis had improved. The proband also had some
features common to Williams syndrome, including dolichocephaly,
bitemporal narrowness, outer canthal distance less than 2 SD below the
mean, periorbital fullness, broad mouth, full cheeks, hoarse voice, and
hypersensitivity to loud noises. The diagnosis of Williams syndrome was
not made because she had normal serum calcium levels, a normal urine
calcium/creatinine ratio, normal psychomotor development, and normal
growth parameters. The child was treated with phenobarbital for
seizures. The mother had had seizures in adolescence. Since childhood,
she had had a grade III (out of VI) early systolic murmur heard best at
the suprasternal notch and radiating to the left carotid. At least 2
other family members were affected by SVAS. The mother's brother had
narrowing of the entire pulmonary arterial tree documented by cardiac
catheterization and was treated for seizures. A maternal first cousin
had severe bilateral peripheral pulmonic stenosis, right ventricular
hypertrophy, and mild SVAS demonstrated by echocardiogram.

Gross rearrangements of the ELN gene have not been identified in most
cases of autosomal dominant SVAS. To define the spectrum of ELN
mutations responsible for SVAS, Li et al. (1997) refined the genomic
structure of the gene and used this information in mutation analyses.
ELN point mutations were found to cosegregate with the disease in 4
familial cases (e.g., 130160.0005) and to be associated with SVAS in 3
sporadic cases (130160.0004). Two of the mutations were nonsense, 1 was
a single bp deletion, and 4 were splice site mutations. In 1 sporadic
case, the mutation had arisen de novo.

Tassabehji et al. (1997) described the complete exon-intron structure of
the ELN gene. All exons are in-frame, allowing exon skipping without
disrupting the reading frame. Microsatellites were located in introns 17
and 18. They found that isolated SVAS was associated with point
mutations that predicted premature chain termination. They stated that
in their experience all patients with a classic Williams syndrome
phenotype had been found to be hemizygous at the elastin locus;
nevertheless, only 5% had severe clinical SVAS. In their 2 SVAS families
with point mutations, each mutation manifested as severe SVAS in the
proband, but as mild cardiac features or nonpenetrance in the mothers.
Tassabehji et al. (1997) considered such variability typical of
phenotypes produced by haploinsufficiency, where genetic background is
expected to have a major modifying effect. An alternative hypothesis is
that a dominant-negative elastin mutation results if truncated proteins
have some but not all domains critical for intermolecular interactions
and thus may disrupt posttranslational processing and development of
elastic fibers.

Koch et al. (2003) similarly found the complete spectrum of arterial
stenoses in 5 members of an extended pedigree with a confirmed nonsense
mutation haplotype.

Urban et al. (2000) used single-strand conformation and heteroduplex
analyses of genomic amplimers to identify point mutations within the ELN
gene in patients with nonsyndromic SVAS from a total of 8 unrelated
families. They identified 6 novel point mutations. Nonpenetrance was
demonstrated in some of the families. Together with the new mutations
they found, 14 point mutations had been reported in SVAS patients, and
10 of these resulted in premature stop codons (PTCs). They analyzed the
expression of ELN alleles in skin fibroblasts from 1 SVAS patient and
showed that PTC mutations resulted in selective elimination of mutant
transcripts. Inhibition of the nonsense-mediated decay mechanism by
cycloheximide resulted in the stabilization of mutant elastin mRNA.
Allelic inactivation by the ELN mutation in this patient led to an
overall decrease of the steady state levels of elastin mRNA. In the skin
fibroblasts from the same SVAS patient, they demonstrated reduced
synthesis and secretion of tropoelastin. Given the predominance of PTC
mutations in SVAS, Urban et al. (2000) suggested that functional
haploinsufficiency may be the pathomechanism underlying most cases of
nonsyndromic SVAS.

Metcalfe et al. (2000) used SSCP and heteroduplex analysis to screen 100
unrelated patients with SVAS and normal karyotypes without major
deletions of the ELN gene as determined by FISH. All 34 exons of the ELN
gene were screened and mutations were identified in 35 of the patients.
The mutations were 23 nonsense or frameshift mutations predicted to
cause premature termination, 6 splice site mutations, 4 missense
mutations, and 2 small deletions in exon 1 encompassing the ATG
initiation codon. The 35 patients represented 24 familial cases, 10
sporadic cases, and 1 of unknown status. Recurrent mutations were the
nonsense mutations Y150X in exon 9 (130160.0013), Q442X in exon 21
(130160.0003), and K176X in exon 10 (130160.0014), which appeared to be
mutation hotspots. A marked phenotypic intrafamilial variability was
illustrated by 2 large families with multiple affected members with
disease severity ranging from asymptomatic carriers to mild or severe
SVAS requiring surgery, or sudden infant death. No obvious
genotype-phenotype correlation was detected; cases with missense or
splicing mutations were as likely to have severe SVAS as cases with
truncating mutations.

Urban et al. (2002) compared both elastogenesis and proliferation rate
of cultured aortic smooth-muscle cells (SMCs) and skin fibroblasts from
5 healthy control subjects, 4 patients with isolated SVAS, and 5
patients with WBS. Three mutations found in patients with SVAS were
found to result in null alleles. RNA blood hybridization,
immunostaining, and metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated that
SVAS cells and WBS cells have reduced elastin mRNA levels and that they
consequently deposit low amounts of insoluble elastin. Abnormally low
levels of elastin deposition in SVAS cells and in WBS cells were found
to coincide with an increase in proliferation rate, which could be
reversed by addition of exogenous insoluble elastin. This led to the
conclusion that insoluble elastin is an important regulator of cellular
proliferation. The reduced net deposition of insoluble elastin in
arterial walls of patients with either SVAS or WBS leads to the
increased proliferation of arterial SMCs, which results in the formation
of multilayer thickening of the tunica media of large arteries and,
consequently, in the development of hyperplastic intimal lesions leading
to segmental arterial occlusion.

Micale et al. (2010) analyzed the ELN gene in 31 familial and sporadic
cases of SVAS and identified 7 novel mutations, including 5 frameshift
mutations and 2 splice site mutations (see, e.g., 130160.0020). In vitro
analysis of 3 of the frameshift mutations using minigene constructs and
transfection assays confirmed that functional haploinsufficiency of the
ELN gene is the main pathomechanism underlying SVAS. In addition,
molecular analysis of patient fibroblasts showed that the 2044+5G-C
(130160.0020) mutant allele encodes an aberrant shorter form of the
elastin polypeptide that may hamper the normal assembly of elastin
fibers in a dominant-negative manner.

- Cutis Laxa

In the cell line from a patient with cutis laxa (123700), Zhang et al.
(1997) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion in exon 30 of the
ELN gene (130160.0008). In a 30-year-old woman and her 2-year-old son,
both of whom had classic cutis laxa, Zhang et al. (1999) identified
heterozygosity for a different 1-bp deletion in the ELN gene
(130160.0010), also in exon 30.

In a 37-year-old Caucasian woman with cutis laxa, Tassabehji et al.
(1998) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp deletion in the ELN gene
(130160.0009).

In a mother and daughter with cutis laxa and severe pulmonary disease,
originally described by Beighton (1972) and Corbett et al. (1994), Urban
et al. (2005) identified no mutations in the elastin gene by direct
sequencing, but detected an abnormal protein in cultured dermal
fibroblasts using metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. Mutation
and gene expression analyses established the presence of a complex
tandem duplication in the elastin gene (130160.0016).

In affected members of a 3-generation family of Japanese and German
ancestry and an unrelated Singaporean girl of Chinese descent with cutis
laxa and aortic aneurysmal disease, Szabo et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for a 25-bp deletion (130160.0017) and a 1-bp deletion
(130160.0018) in exon 30 of the ELN gene, respectively.

gene and susceptibility to intracranial berry aneurysm, see ANIB1
(105800).

ANIMAL MODEL

Faury et al. (2003) reported that Eln +/- mice were stably hypertensive
from birth, with a mean arterial pressure 25 to 30 mm Hg higher than
their wildtype counterparts. The animals had only moderate cardiac
hypertrophy and lived a normal life span with no overt signs of
degenerative vascular disease. Examination of arterial mechanical
properties showed that the inner diameters of Eln +/- arteries were
generally smaller than wildtype arteries at any given intravascular
pressure. Because the Eln +/- mice were hypertensive, however, the
effective arterial working diameter was comparable to that of the
normotensive wildtype animal. Physiologic studies indicated a role for
the renin (179820)-angiotensin (see 106150) system in maintaining the
hypertensive state. Faury et al. (2003) concluded that the association
of hypertension with elastin haploinsufficiency in humans and mice
strongly suggested that elastin and other proteins of the elastic fiber
should be considered as causal genes for essential hypertension.

Hirano et al. (2008) stated that the Eln gene in most mammalian species
contains 36 exons. The rat and mouse Eln genes have 37 exons, whereas
the human ELN gene has only 34 exons due to the sequential loss of 2
exons during primate evolution. In addition, although still contained
within the human gene, exon 22 is rarely included in the elastin
transcript. The mouse and human ELN proteins share only 64.1% amino acid
identity. Because of the structural differences between mouse and human
ELN, Hirano et al. (2008) developed a humanized elastin mouse in which
elastin production was controlled by a human ELN transgene. Expression
of the human transgene reversed the hypertension and cardiovascular
changes associated with Eln haploinsufficiency and rescued the perinatal
lethality of the Eln-null phenotype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, 100-KB DEL

In a family with SVAS (185500), Ewart et al. (1994) found a heterozygous
100-kb deletion in the 3-prime end of the elastin gene with a breakpoint
between elastin exons 27 and 28. The same region was disrupted in the
familial reciprocal translocation reported by Morris et al. (1993).
Ewart et al. (1994) pointed out that the protein product of the mutant
gene would lack a microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP; 156790)
binding site that normally exists in the C terminus of elastin.

.0002
SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, 30-KB DEL

Olson et al. (1995) used Southern blot analysis to screen for mutations
in the ELN gene in 6 familial and 3 sporadic cases of SVAS (185500)
without features of Williams-Beuren syndrome (194050). The familial
cases included members of a previously reported large pedigree with
linkage to the elastin gene region (Olson et al., 1993). A 30-kb
deletion extending from breakpoints in intron 1 and intron 27 was found
in 2 members of a Middle Eastern family. The proband developed severe
SVAS and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis and underwent aortic
operation in early childhood. He had no evidence of Williams syndrome or
clinically apparent abnormalities of other elastin-containing tissue.
The deletion was also demonstrated in his mother, an obligate carrier
with subtle disease (a heart murmur and a nondiagnostic echocardiogram).
Blood for DNA analysis was not available from a maternal uncle with SVAS
and a sister with isolated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis.

SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, GLN442TER

Li et al. (1997) found a heterozygous nonsense mutation in a sporadic
case of SVAS (185500): a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1324, resulting
in conversion of a glutamine to a premature stop codon (Q442X) in exon
21. DNA samples could not be obtained from the parents of the proband.

Tassabehji et al. (1997) found the same mutation in a patient with SVAS.
The patient had presented at the age of 8 weeks with a heart murmur and
episodes of cyanosis. Echocardiography at 4 months of age showed SVAS
and pulmonary arterial stenosis. These changes were progressive.
Corrective open heart surgery was performed at the age of 21 months, at
which time it was noted that the aorta and pulmonary arteries were very
thick and abnormal. His mother had had cardiac follow-up for a heart
murmur until the age of 6 years, but echocardiogram showed no evidence
of SVAS and no pulmonary artery stenosis.

Metcalfe et al. (2000) found the Q442X mutation in 3 unrelated patients
with SVAS among 100 patients screened. Haplotype analysis using ELN
flanking and intragenic markers showed no evidence of a founder effect;
therefore this appeared to be a mutation hotspot.

.0004
SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, ARG570TER

In a sporadic case of SVAS (185500), Li et al. (1997) found a nonsense
mutation: a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1708, resulting in
conversion of arginine-570 to a premature stop codon in exon 25 (R570X).
DNA samples could not be obtained from the parents of the proband.

Metcalfe et al. (2000) detected the R570X mutation in a sporadic case of
SVAS with peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis and bilateral inguinal
hernias.

.0005
SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, 1-BP DEL, 1821C

Using primers amplifying exon 26 of the ELN gene, Li et al. (1997)
identified an anomalous band that cosegregated with SVAS (185500) in 1
family. The aberrant conformer showed a single-nucleotide deletion at
position 1821 in exon 26 (1821delC). This deletion caused a frameshift
resulting in a premature stop codon in exon 28.

.0006
SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, IVS15AS, A-G, -2

In 2 unrelated kindreds, Li et al. (1997) found that SVAS (185500)
segregated with an A-to-G transition at position -2 in the splice
acceptor site of intron 15 preceding exon 16.

.0007
SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, 1-BP INS, FS615TER

In a patient with SVAS (185500), Tassabehji et al. (1997) identified
insertion of a T in codon 606 of exon 26 of the ELN gene, producing a
frameshift predicted to cause premature termination 10 codons
downstream. The patient presented at birth with a heart murmur. At the
age of 3 years, echocardiography suggested SVAS on the basis of
'waisting' of the ascending aorta and poststenotic dilatation. A brother
had died suddenly in the first year of life and at autopsy was noted to
have spontaneously repaired SVAS, repaired central pulmonary artery
stenosis, and marked ventricular hypertrophy. The aortic valve and
proximal aorta were markedly dysplastic with extreme thickening beyond
the valve. The proband's mother had presented to cardiologists in
childhood with a murmur and a clinical diagnosis of aortic stenosis had
been made.

.0008
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1
ELN, 1-BP DEL, 2012G

In a patient with cutis laxa (123700), Zhang et al. (1995) demonstrated
decreased elastin mRNA levels in skin fibroblasts due to transcript
instability. Zhang et al. (1997) cloned and sequenced both ELN cDNA
alleles in the cell line from this patient and identified a frameshift
mutation, deletion of 2012G, in the C-terminal coding region of 1
allele. The patient was heterozygous for the single base deletion, which
was not found in genomic DNA from either parent or from 65 unrelated
control samples. The mutant transcript was overrepresented compared to
the normal transcript.

.0009
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1
ELN, 1-BP DEL, 748A

In a 37-year-old Caucasian patient with autosomal dominant cutis laxa
(123700), Tassabehji et al. (1998) identified heterozygosity for a
frameshift mutation in exon 32 of the elastin gene which was predicted
to replace 37 amino acids at the C terminus of elastin by a novel
sequence of 62 amino acids. Immunoprecipitation studies and mRNA showed
that the mutant allele was expressed. Electron microscopy of the skin
sections showed abnormal branching and fragmentation in the amorphous
elastin component, and immunocytochemistry showed reduced elastin
deposition in the elastic fibers and fewer microfibrils in the dermis.
These findings suggested that the mutant tropoelastin protein was
synthesized, secreted, and incorporated into the elastic matrix, where
it altered the architecture of elastic fibers. Interference with
crosslinking would reduce elastic recoil in affected tissues and explain
the cutis laxa phenotype.

.0010
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1
ELN, 1-BP DEL, 2039C

In a 30-year-old woman and her 2-year-old son, both of whom had classic
cutis laxa (123700), Zhang et al. (1999) identified heterozygosity for a
deletion of 2039C from exon 30 of the ELN gene. The same exon was the
site of the mutation in the 2012delG deletion (130160.0008).

.0011
SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, IVS15AS, C-G, -3

In 2 large, independently collected midwestern US pedigrees with
supravalvular aortic stenosis (185500), Urban et al. (1999) found a
C-to-G transversion in the acceptor splice site of intron 15 of the
elastin gene. The mutation segregated in both families with high
penetrance of SVAS, and all affected individuals carried the mutation.
Haplotype analysis indicated that the mutations in the 2 apparently
nonoverlapping kindreds were identical by descent. RT-PCR of elastin
from skin fibroblasts of an affected individual showed 2 abnormal
elastin species present as 0.9% and 0.3% of the total elastin message.
One transcript arose from activation of a cryptic splice site in intron
15 that added 44 bp of intronic sequence to the sequence encoded by exon
16 and led to a premature termination codon in exon 17 because of
frameshift; the other transcript arose from skipping of exon 16. The
miniscule amount of transcript associated with this mutation supported
haploinsufficiency of elastin as the etiology of SVAS.

.0012
SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, 1-BP DEL, 1040C

In a large German family with SVAS (185500), Boeckel et al. (1999)
identified a 1-bp deletion (1040delC) in codon 347 of exon 18 of the ELN
gene, resulting in a stop codon in exon 22. The mutation was present in
heterozygous state. The family studied had affected individuals in 4
generations and by implication in a fifth earlier generation. The
severity of the phenotype appeared to increase in successive
generations, i.e., the phenomenon of anticipation. Tassabehji et al.
(1997) noted that the mothers of their severely affected SVAS patients
with ELN point mutations had only mild cardiac features or
nonpenetrance. Boeckel et al. (1999) observed nonpenetrance in at least
2 individuals, brothers, both of whom transmitted the disorder to
children.

.0013
SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, TYR150TER

Metcalfe et al. (2000) identified a tyr150-to-ter (Y150X) mutation in
exon 9 of the ELN gene in 4 unrelated patients with SVAS (185500) among
100 patients screened. Haplotype analysis using ELN flanking and
intragenic markers showed no evidence of a founder effect; therefore
this appeared to be a mutation hotspot.

.0014
SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, LYS176TER

Metcalfe et al. (2000) detected a lys176-to-ter (K176X; 526A-T) mutation
in exon 10 of the ELN gene in 2 apparently unrelated familial cases of
SVAS (185500) among 100 patients screened.

.0015
SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, ARG610GLN AND 24-BP DUP, NT1034

In 2 related families with supravalvular aortic stenosis (185500), Urban
et al. (2001) identified 2 ELN mutations located on the same allele: an
in-frame duplication of nucleotides 1034-1057 in exon 18, and an 1829G-A
change in exon 26 predicted to result in an arg610-to-gln (R610Q)
substitution. In 1 family, an individual was identified with a
recombination between exons 18 and 26 of the ELN gene. This individual
was unaffected and carried the exon 18 insertion mutation but not
1829G-A. Skin fibroblasts were established from this recombinant normal
individual and from an affected individual carrying both of the
mutations. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of the mutant
allele was reduced to 12 to 27% of that of the normal allele in the
affected but not in the unaffected individual. Further studies showed
reduced steady state elastin mRNA levels and tropoelastin synthesis in
the affected individual. RT-PCR analysis of the mRNA rescued by
cycloheximide treatment indicated that the 1829G-A mutation created a
cryptic donor splice site within exon 26, resulting in the deletion of 4
nucleotides at the 3-prime end of exon 26 and a frameshift in the mRNA.
This frameshift mutation generated a premature termination codon in the
domain encoded by exon 28, clearly resulting in nonsense-mediated decay
of this frameshift RNA product. Despite considerable variability in the
molecular nature of mutations responsible for SVAS, the unifying
mechanism appears to be the generation of null alleles by
nonsense-mediated decay leading to elastin haploinsufficiency.

.0016
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1
ELN, EX9-33DUP

In a mother and daughter with cutis laxa (123700) and severe pulmonary
disease, originally described by Beighton (1972) and Corbett et al.
(1994), Urban et al. (2005) identified no mutations in the elastin gene
by direct sequencing, but detected an abnormal protein in cultured
dermal fibroblasts using metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation.
Mutation and gene expression analyses established the presence of a
heterozygous complex rearrangement involving the duplication of exons 9
to 33, with a third copy of exons 9 and 10 and intron 10 added to the
end of the mRNA; nucleotides 3-65 of intron 10 encode a 21-amino acid
missense peptide sequence before ending in a stop codon.
Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the mutant tropoelastin is
partially secreted and partially retained intracellularly; a polyclonal
antibody raised against a unique peptide in the mutant molecule showed
both intracellular and matrix staining.

.0017
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1
ELN, 25-BP DEL, NT2114

In affected members of a 3-generation family of Japanese and German
ancestry with cutis laxa (123700) and aortic aneurysmal disease, Szabo
et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a 25-bp deletion beginning
at nucleotide 2114 in exon 30 of the ELN gene. There was variable
expression of cutis laxa, hernias, and aortic lesions in affected family
members. The mutation was not found in 121 controls.

.0018
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1
ELN, 1-BP DEL, 2159C

In a Singaporean girl of Chinese descent with cutis laxa (123700) and
aortic aneurysmal disease, Szabo et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity
for a de novo 1-bp deletion (2159delC) in exon 30 of the ELN gene. The
mutation was not found in either of her parents or in 121 controls.

.0019
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1
ELN, 1621C-T

In a boy with severe cutis laxa (123700), severe congenital pulmonary
disease (previously not reported in ADCL), and supravalvular pulmonary
artery stenosis, Graul-Neumann et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous
1621C-T transition in the ELN gene, resulting in an in-frame deletion of
exon 25 and predicting a protein lacking amino acids 527-540. The same
mutation was present in the clinically healthy father, but not in the
mother, the paternal grandparents, or 96 healthy controls. Analysis of
ELN expression in fibroblasts revealed the same amount of complete ELN
mRNA in the proband as in normal age-matched controls, whereas the
father had a more than 50% reduction of ELN mRNA expression as compared
to corresponding age-matched controls. In contrast, addition of the
translation inhibitor puromcin caused an increase in total ELN mRNA
expression in the father. Graul-Neumann et al. (2008) concluded that the
variable processing of an identically mutated gene (dominant negative in
the child and haploinsufficiency in the father) caused the highly
variable clinical appearance of ADCL in this family.

.0020
SUPRAVALVULAR AORTIC STENOSIS
ELN, IVS28, G-C, +5

In a 3-generation family with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS;
185500), Micale et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 2044+5G-C
transversion in intron 28 of the ELN gene. The mutation was present in
all 3 family members who had been diagnosed with SVAS as well as in 1
asymptomatic family member; it was not found in 2 more unaffected family
members or in 100 unrelated control samples. RT-PCR analysis of elastin
mRNA from transfected HEK293 cells as well as patient fibroblasts
demonstrated 2 distinct transcripts, a 200-bp band corresponding to
wildtype mRNA product and a 300-bp mutant; sequencing confirmed that the
longer transcript resulted from splicing failure and inclusion of intron
28 in the mRNA, predicting a shorter elastin protein with a premature
termination codon within the same intron. Assessment of ELN mRNA
expression level after incubation of patient fibroblasts with an
inhibitor of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) showed no significant
increase in ELN mRNA aberrant transcript, indicating that this mutation
is conceivably not a substrate of NMD.

608076	TITLE *608076 TYROSINE KINASE, NONRECEPTOR, 1; TNK1
;;CD38-NEGATIVE KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TNK1 is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. These kinases, like members of
the SRC (190090) and JAK (see 147795) families, mediate intracellular
signaling downstream of receptor activation.

CLONING

Using degenerate primers based on conserved tyrosine kinase motifs,
Hoehn et al. (1996) cloned TNK1 by PCR of cDNA from CD38
(107270)-negative umbilical cord blood cells enriched for early
progenitors. They obtained the full-length TNK1 cDNA by 5-prime and
3-prime RACE of an erythroleukemia cell line cDNA library. The deduced
666-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 72 kD.
TNK1 contains a putative N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain,
followed by the tyrosine kinase domain, a putative SH3 domain, and a
proline-rich C terminus that contains SH3-binding motifs. The kinase
domain has all 12 structural features conserved in tyrosine kinases,
including an ATP-binding site. TNK1 shares highest homology with ACK
(606994), including 45% amino acid identity over a 413-amino acid span
that includes the kinase domain and putative SH3 domain. Northern blot
analysis detected a 3.0-kb transcript in prostate, testis, ovary, small
intestine, and colon. Northern blot analysis of fetal tissues detected
tissue-specific expression of 4 transcripts between 1.0 and 9.5 kb in
fetal brain, lung, liver, and kidney. RT-PCR detected TNK1 expression in
all bone marrow, cord blood, and peripheral blood cells examined, and in
16 of 20 leukemia cell lines.

MAPPING

By PCR of rodent/human cell lines and FISH, Hoehn et al. (1996) mapped
the TNK1 gene to chromosome 17p13.1.

607287	TITLE *607287 LSM7 PROTEIN; LSM7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Sm-like proteins were identified in a variety of organisms based on
sequence homology with the Sm protein family (see SNRPD2; 601061).
Sm-like proteins contain the Sm sequence motif, which consists of 2
regions separated by a linker of variable length that folds as a loop.
The Sm-like proteins are thought to form a stable heteromer present in
tri-snRNP particles, which are important for pre-mRNA splicing.

CLONING

In a search for human Sm-like proteins, Achsel et al. (1999)
fractionated proteins present in purified (U4/U6.U5) tri-snRNPs and
isolated 7 Sm-like proteins, which they named LSm2-LSm8. Using partial
peptide sequence for database searches, they identified and sequenced
EST clones. Using additional sequence obtained by PCR amplification of a
HeLa cDNA library, they assembled full-length cDNA sequences for
LSM2-LSM8.

Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999) searched database sequence for Sm proteins
and identified 16 potential Sm-related genes in yeast as well as some
Sm-related genes in human and archaebacteria. Using a multiple sequence
alignment of Sm domains, they built a phylogenetic tree of yeast, human,
and archaeal Sm and Sm-like proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electron-microscopy, Achsel et al. (1999) observed that purified
LSm proteins form a heteromer that is stable even in the absence of RNA
and exhibits a doughnut-shaped structure similar to the Sm core RNP
structure. They demonstrated that the purified LSm heteromer binds
specifically to the U6 snRNA at its 3-prime-terminal U-tract. They also
showed that the LSm proteins facilitate the formation of U4/U6 RNA
duplexes in vitro and concluded that the LSm proteins may play a role in
U4/U6 snRNP formation.

Using immunoprecipitation experiments, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that there is a complex of 7 Sm-like proteins bound to RNA in
yeast. Lsm2-Lsm8 coprecipitate the U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs and directly
associate with the U6 snRNA present in the free U6 snRNP. Additionally,
the yeast Lsm2-Lsm7 proteins were found to be associated with the
pre-RNase P RNA but not the mature RNase RNA. Using immunoprecipitation
experiments from human cell extracts, Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
showed that the LSM3 and LSM4 proteins are specifically associated with
snRNP complexes containing the U6 snRNA. Salgado-Garrido et al. (1999)
concluded that Sm and Sm-like proteins assemble in at least 2
functionally conserved complexes of deep evolutionary origin.

By disrupting the Sm and Sm-like genes in yeast, Salgado-Garrido et al.
(1999) concluded that disruption of genes encoding Sm-like proteins
directly associated with the U6 snRNA (Lsm2-8) generated variable
phenotypes. Lsm2, Lsm3, Lsm4, and Lsm8 are essential for vegetative
growth. Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 are not essential for growth; however,
their disruptions lead to slow growth especially at elevated
temperature. The levels of the U6 snRNA were strongly reduced in the
strains harboring the Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 disruptions. Lsm1 and Lsm9
are dispensable for vegetative growth, but Lsm1 is required for optimal
vegetative growth at 30 degrees and is temperature sensitive.

Ingelfinger et al. (2002) determined that human LSM1 to LSM7, but not
LSM8, were expressed in HeLa cells within cytoplasmic foci. The foci
also contained a decapping enzyme (DCP1/2) and the exonuclease XRN1
(607994). Coexpression of wildtype and mutant LSM proteins, as well as
fluorescence resonance energy transfer, indicated that the LSM proteins
form a complex similar to one found in yeast. Ingelfinger et al. (2002)
concluded that the foci contain a partially or fully assembled machinery
for the degradation of mRNA.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LSM7
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP stSG29317).

607419	TITLE *607419 GEM-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 7; GEMIN7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GEMIN7 is part of the large macromolecular SMN complex (see 600354),
which is localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and plays a
role in the cytoplasmic assembly of small nuclear ribonuculeoproteins
(snRNPs).

CLONING

Pellizzoni et al. (2002) identified a number of proteins that
coimmunoprecipitate with SMN or with GEMIN2 (602595) from lysates of
human kidney cells, including GEMIN6 (607006) and a 15-kD protein.
Baccon et al. (2002) sequenced the 15-kD protein, which they called
GEMIN7, identified corresponding ESTs, and cloned GEMIN7 by PCR
amplification of a cDNA library. The deduced 131-amino acid GEMIN7
protein contains several RG repeats. By EST database searching, Baccon
et al. (2002) also identified the putative mouse ortholog, which shares
82% amino acid sequence identity with the human protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and immunolocalization experiments, Baccon
et al. (2002) demonstrated that GEMIN7 is a component of the SMN complex
and colocalizes with SMN in the cytoplasm and in gems. Binding
experiments showed that GEMIN7 interacts directly with SMN and GEMIN6
and mediates the association of GEMIN6 with the SMN complex. The RG
repeats were necessary for its interaction with SMN. GEMIN7 also
interacted with several Sm proteins of snRNPs, particularly with SmE
(SNRPE; 128260).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GEMIN7
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP SHGC-112).

607860	TITLE *607860 YY1 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; YY1AP1
;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.

613583	TITLE *613583 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 62; WDR62
;;C19ORF14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The WDR62 gene encodes a protein that localizes to the centrosome and to
the nucleus, depending on the cell phase and on the cell type (summary
by Bhat et al., 2011).

CLONING

Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified the WDR62 gene in mutation analysis of
a patient with microcephaly and cortical abnormalities. The WDR62 gene
encodes a 1,523-amino acid protein. Immunohistochemical staining of
human fetal brain at 20 weeks' gestation demonstrated enriched WDR62
expression within the ventricular and subventricular zones. Stainings
suggested predominantly nuclear localization, which was confirmed by
immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis. WDR62 is
expressed by neural stem cells and intermediate progenitors, marked by
SOX2 (184429) and TBR2 (604615) expression. Expression of WDR62 in the
neocortex is transient, spanning the period of embryonic neurogenesis.
Unlike other microcephaly genes, WDR62 apparently does not associate
with centrosomes.

Nicholas et al. (2010) noted that WDR62 contains at least 15 WD repeats.
In HeLa, HEK293, and B lymphoblastoid cells, they found that WDR62 had
weak, diffuse cytoplasmic expression and was not found in the nucleus
during interphase. However, during mitosis, WDR62 accumulated strongly
at the spindle poles, although it was not present at the midbody in
cytokinesis. The expression pattern of WDR62 was identical to that of
ASPM (605481), which is mutant in primary microcephaly-5 (MCPH5;
608716). Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy of mouse embryonic
brain showed Wdr62 expression exclusively in apical precursors
undergoing mitosis at the apical-ventricular surface in the
neuroepithelium of the future cerebral cortex. Wdr62 expression was also
found exclusively in intermediate neural precursors found in the
subventricular zone during mitosis. Similar localization to mitotic
neural precursor cells was observed in human embryonic brain tissue.
WDR62 expression was also found in newborn neurons and in the outermost
layer of neurons that had just migrated to the cortical plate.

Yu et al. (2010) found widespread expression of Wdr62 in the developing
mouse brain, with highest expression in the forebrain. Expression was
seen in the ventricular zone and cortical plate, consistent with roles
in progenitor cells and postmitotic neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bilguvar et al. (2010) determined that the WDR62 gene contains 32 exons.

There are alternative WDR62 transcripts in humans: exon 27 contains an
in-frame intraexonic alternative splice acceptor site, resulting in the
exclusion of the first 12 nucleotides (Nicholas et al., 2010).

MAPPING

The WDR62 gene maps to chromosome 19q13.12 (Bilguvar et al., 2010).

GENE FUNCTION

Yu et al. (2010) found notable cell-cycle dependent cellular
localization of WDR62 in HeLa and HEK cells. During interphase, there
was punctate, perinuclear expression, suggesting localization to the
Golgi apparatus, whereas during M phase, WDR62 was found at the spindle
poles. The subcellular localization resembled that of CEP170 (613023).
The findings suggested a major centrosomal role for WDR62.

In cellular studies, Bhat et al. (2011) found that WDR62 localized to
centrosomes throughout mitotic progression. No staining was observed at
the midbody during cytokinesis. During interphase, WDR62 localized to
nucleoli. The findings indicated that WDR62 is a centrosomal as well as
a nuclear protein and that localization is dependent both on the cell
phase and on the cell type.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified 2 missense, 2 nonsense, and 2
frameshift mutations (613583.0001-613583.0005) in the WDR62 gene in 10
patients with microcephaly-2 with cortical malformations (MCPH2;
604317). All patients were from consanguineous Turkish families and
manifested with microcephaly, moderate to severe mental retardation, and
cortical malformation including pachygyria with cortical thickening,
microgyria, lissencephaly, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum,
schizencephaly, and in 1 instance, cerebellar hypoplasia.

In affected members of 2 consanguineous Pakistani families with primary
microcephaly showing linkage to chromosome 19q13 (MCPH2) (Roberts et
al., 1999), Nicholas et al. (2010) identified 2 different homozygous
mutations in the WDR62 gene (613583.0006 and 613583.0007, respectively).
In 5 additional consanguineous families of Pakistani, Arab, and
Caucasian ancestry with primary microcephaly, they identified 4
different homozygous WDR62 mutations (see, e.g.,
613583.0008-613583.0009, 613583.0011). Overall, the findings indicated
that WDR62 is a key protein in enabling spindle poles to position the
cytokinetic furrow and prolong neural precursor generation, a process
that is uniquely vital to the proper growth of the human cerebral
cortex.

Yu et al. (2010) identified 6 different homozygous mutations in the
WDR62 gene (see, e.g., 613583.0009-613583.0011) in affected members of 6
consanguineous families with microcephaly-2 with cortical malformations,
including polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, and subcortical heterotopia.

Bhat et al. (2011) identified 2 different homozygous truncating WDR62
mutations in 2 unrelated consanguineous Indian families with MCPH2 with
cortical malformations, bringing the total number of pathogenic
mutations in the gene to 17. Six of the 17 mutations are missense, and
mutations occur throughout the gene sequence. Bhat et al. (2011)
emphasized the wide phenotypic spectrum of cortical malformations in
mutation carriers.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 4-BP DEL, TGCC

In 2 sibs with autosomal recessive microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317) and in an affected child from another family, all
from consanguineous Turkish unions, Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for a 4-basepair deletion (TGCC) in exon 31 of the WDR62
gene. This deletion occurred at amino acid 1,402 and resulted in
frameshift and premature termination (V1402GfsX12). The mutation was
heterozygous in all parents. It was not observed in 1,290 Turkish
control chromosomes. The index patient was a 4-year, 6-month-old female
who initially presented at 4 months of age with small head size. At 2
years, 3 months she showed micrognathia and a bulbous nose, and suffered
from severe mental retardation. She had had no seizures. MRI showed
diffuse cortical thickening and pachygyria. The patient from the second
family was a 2-year, 4 month-old male. He had microcephaly and
developmental delay but no seizures. Coronal images of this patient
showed findings of microlissencephaly including prominent microcephaly,
bilateral Sylvian clefts, hypoplastic corpus callosum, and thickened
cortex. The kinship coefficients between affected individuals from both
families were consistent with fourth-degree relatedness.

.0002
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, GLU526LYS

In a 15-year, 5-month old female with microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317), the child of consanguineous Turkish parents,
Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A substitution
in exon 12 of the WDR62 gene, resulting in a glutamic acid-to-lysine
substitution at codon 526 (E526K). The glutamic acid at codon 526 was
invariant in all species examined from human to zebrafish and lamprey.
This mutation was found in heterozygosity in 3 apparently unrelated
neurologically normal Turkish individuals, giving an allele frequency of
0.2%. The patient presented to medical attention at age 3.5 years with
poor verbal skills. She had microcephaly, severe mental retardation,
prognathism, dysconjugate gaze, and dysarthria, and was able to ambulate
independently. Although abnormal electroencephalograms were noted, the
patient never suffered an overt seizure.

.0003
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, TRP224SER

In 2 sibs and their cousin with microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317), Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity
for a missense mutation in the WDR62 gene, a G-to-C transversion in exon
6 that converted tryptophan to serine at codon 224 (W224S). All parents
were heterozygous. The mutation was not identified in 1,290 Turkish and
1,500 Caucasian control chromosomes. Tryptophan-224 was invariant in all
species examined from human to zebrafish and lamprey. The proband was a
6-year, 5-month-old boy who presented at 2 years of age with
hyperactivity, seizures, and inability to sleep. He experienced 4 to 8
seizures per day and had microcephaly, micrognathia, and severe mental
retardation, and could ambulate only with assistance. The sibs were
cousins of the proband. One was an 8-year, 7-month-old female who
presented at age 3 with seizures. She was microcephalic, hyperactive,
and had dysconjugate gaze. She was able to walk independently and had no
obvious dysmorphic features but had moderate mental retardation. Her
brother was 12 years, 11 months old. He had seizures, self-mutilating
behavior, and severe mental retardation, but could ambulate
independently.

MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, GLN470TER

In a 14-year, 6-month-old male with microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317), the product of a consanguineous Turkish union,
Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition
in exon 11 of the WDR62 gene, resulting in a glutamine-to-termination
substitution at codon 470 (Q470X). This mutation was not identified in
1,290 Turkish and 1,500 Caucasian control chromosomes. The patient was
severely mentally retarded but had never had seizures. He had required
surgery for hernia repair and cryptorchidism.

MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 17-BP DEL

In a 10-year, 10-month-old female with microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317), the product of a consanguineous Turkish union,
Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 17-bp deletion in
exon 30 of the WDR62 gene, leading to a frameshift at codon 1,280 with
premature termination following a novel peptide of 20 amino acids
(G1280AfsX21). She presented to medical attention at 3 months of age
with failure to thrive and small head size. On neurologic examination
she was noted to have good head control. She recognized her mother and
had a social smile. This mutation was not identified in 1,290 Turkish
and 1,500 Caucasian control chromosomes.

MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
WDR62, ARG438HIS

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with primary
microcephaly-2 (MCPH2; 604317), originally reported by Roberts et al.
(1999), Nicholas et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1313G-A
transition in exon 10 of the WDR62 gene, resulting in an arg438-to-his
(R438H) substitution in a highly conserved residue. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that the mutant protein did not localize
correctly to the spindle poles during mitosis. The mutation was not
found in 298 Pakistani control chromosomes. Brain scan from 1 patient
showed a simplified gyral pattern.

.0007
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
WDR62, 1-BP DUP, 4241T

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with MCPH2
(604317), originally reported by Roberts et al. (1999), Nicholas et al.
(2010) identified a homozygous 1-bp duplication (4241dupT) in exon 31 of
the WDR62 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutation was predicted to result in a stable transcript with C-terminal
deletion of 109 amino acids in a region that contains neither predicted
protein domains nor posttranslational modification sites. The mutation
was not found in 298 Pakistani control chromosomes. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that the mutant protein did not localize
correctly to the spindle poles during mitosis. Brain scans of patients
were not available.

MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
WDR62, ASP511ASN

In affected individuals from 2 unrelated Pakistani families with MCPH2
(604317), Nicholas et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1531G-A
transition in exon 11 of the WDR62 gene, resulting in an asp511-to-asn
(D511N) substitution in a highly conserved residue. The mutation was
found in 1 of 284 Pakistani control chromosomes. Brain scans of the
affected individuals were not available.

MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 1-BP INS, 3936C

In a Turkish boy, born of consanguineous parents, with microcephaly-2
with cortical malformations (604317), Yu et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1-bp insertion (3936insC) in exon 30 of the WDR62 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The mutation was
not identified in 508 control individuals. He had severely delayed
psychomotor development, and brain MRI showed polymicrogyria, simplified
gyral pattern, volume loss, and a corpus callosum with incomplete genu
and small splenium. A second pregnancy was terminated after the
ultrasound showed microcephaly and abnormal gyral pattern in the fetus.

In a Caucasian girl, born of consanguineous parents, with microcephaly,
thickened cerebral cortex, and severe developmental delay, Nicholas et
al. (2010) identified homozygosity for the 3936insC mutation, which they
termed 3936dupC. The mutation was not identified in 396 Caucasian
control chromosomes.

.0010
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 1-BP DEL, 363T

In 3 affected Mexican sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with
microcephaly-2 with cortical malformations (604317), Yu et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (363delT) in exon 4 of the WDR62
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The mutation
was not identified in 508 control individuals. There was some phenotypic
variability: 2 sibs had small heads with a simplified gyral pattern on
brain MRI, 1 of whom had also had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and
severe psychomotor retardation. The third sib did not have seizures but
had more severe microcephaly (-5.4 SD), normal early psychomotor
development with later delay, and more complex MRI changes, including a
simplified gyral pattern, thin corpus callosum, and subcortical band
heterotopia.

.0011
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH OR WITHOUT CORTICAL
MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, VAL65MET

In 3 affected Saudi Arabian sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with
microcephaly-2 with cortical malformations (604317), Yu et al. (2010)
identified homozygosity for a 193G-A transition in exon 2 of the WDR62
gene, resulting in a val65-to-met (V65M) substitution in a highly
conserved residue. The mutation was not identified in 508 control
individuals. Two sibs were more severely affected, with severe
microcephaly (-9.2 to -9.8 SD), profound psychomotor delay with spastic
quadriparesis, and polymicrogyria and open lip schizencephaly on brain
MRI. The third patient had microcephaly (-5.3 SD), developmental delay,
and simplified gyral pattern on brain MRI. All had relative preservation
of the cerebellum and brainstem.

In 3 Arab sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with primary
microcephaly (MCPH2; 604317), Nicholas et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for the V65M mutation. The mutation was not identified in
184 Arab control chromosomes. Brain scans of these patients were not
available.

.0012
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 1-BP DEL, 2083A

In 2 brothers with MCPH2 with polymicrogyria (604317), who were born of
unrelated parents of northern European descent, Murdock et al. (2011)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 truncating mutations in the
WDR62 gene: a 1-bp deletion (2083delA) in exon 17 and a 2-bp deletion
(2472delAG; 613583.0013) in exon 23. Both mutations were predicted to
cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and loss of function. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. The mutations were
identified by exome sequencing. The phenotype of the sibs varied. The
first sib, whose pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes, had
a more severe phenotype, with extensive bilateral polymicrogyria,
abnormal corpus callosum, global developmental delay, intractable
seizures, and spastic quadriparesis. The second sib had extensive
polymicrogyria and gray matter heterotopia, but did not have seizures;
he had age-appropriate cognition and only mild unilateral hemiparesis.
Both patients had head circumferences less than the fifth percentile.

603838	TITLE *603838 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 BETA SUBCOMPLEX, 2; NDUFB2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first
enzyme complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. NDUFB2
is a nuclear encoded subunit located in the hydrophobic protein fraction
of complex I (Loeffen et al., 1998).

CLONING

By EST database searching and PCR, Loeffen et al. (1998) isolated human
cDNAs encoding NDUFB2 and 7 other complex I subunits. The predicted
105-amino acid human protein is 84% identical to Aggg, its bovine
homolog. Hydropathy analysis revealed that NDUFB2 and 4 other subunits
had an overall hydrophilic pattern, even though they were found within
the hydrophobic protein fraction of complex I.

614312	TITLE *614312 ZINC FINGER MYND-CONTAINING PROTEIN 15; ZMYND15
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ZMYND15 is predicted to be a histone deacetylase-dependent
transcriptional repressor that controls normal temporal expression of
haploid cell genes during spermiogenesis (Yan et al., 2010).

CLONING

Yan et al. (2010) cloned mouse Zmynd15, and they identified human
ZMYND15 by database analysis. The deduced 703-amino acid mouse protein
contains a zinc finger MYND motif and a nuclear localization signal.
Human, mouse, and rat ZMYND15 share more than 85% amino acid homology.
RT-PCR analysis revealed Zmynd15 expression in mouse testis, but not in
any other tissue examined, including ovary and uterus. Expression in
developing mouse testis began at postnatal day 17 and increased at
postnatal day 21 and thereafter. EST database analysis indicated that
human ZMYND15 is also exclusively expressed in testis. In situ and
immunohistochemical analysis of adult mouse testis revealed expression
in developing sperm cells, with lower expression in both pachytene
spermatocytes and mature sperm.

GENE FUNCTION

Yan et al. (2010) found that expression of mouse Zmynd15 in 10t1/2 cells
inhibited transcription of a reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Zmynd15 interacted with the
class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) Hdac1 (601241) and Hdac3 (605166)
and the class II HDACs Hdac6 (300272) and Hdac7 (HDAC7A; 606542).

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the ZMYND15 gene to chromosome 17p13.2 based on an
alignment of the ZMYND15 gene (GenBank GENBANK AL136893) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Yan et al. (2010) mapped the mouse Zmynd15 and Cxcl16 (605398) genes to
chromosome 11. The genes are in opposite orientations with overlapping
5-prime UTRs.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yan et al. (2010) found that Zmynd15 -/- male mice were infertile,
whereas both Zmynd15 +/- males and Zmynd15 -/- females showed normal
fertility. Zmynd15 -/- testis were reduced in weight compared with
wildtype testis, with severe spermatid depletion. Late spermatids of
Zmynd15 -/- testis detached from the seminiferous epithelium and were
sloughed into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. Semiquantitative
PCR and microarray analyses revealed misregulation of several genes
required for normal spermatogenesis in Zmynd15 -/- testis.

138300	TITLE +138300 GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE; GSR
GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE, HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA DUE TO DEFICIENCY OF, IN RED
CELLS, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION Long (1967) found in a black American a variant red cell GSR (EC
1.6.4.2) characterized by greater electrophoretic mobility and enzyme
activity per unit of hemoglobin than the normal. Inheritance was
autosomal codominant. Three homozygotes were identified. The relation to
gout, suggested by Long (1967), is problematical. Long (1972) observed 2
variant forms of red cell GSR which appear to bind far more avidly than
the common form of the enzyme. In cases of mosaic trisomy for chromosome
8, de la Chapelle et al. (1976) found elevated glutathione reductase
activity, with other enzymes normal. George and Francke (1976) assigned
the gene to the region 8p21-p23 by the gene dosage method. In an infant
with terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 8, de la Chapelle
et al. (1976) found low GSR activity. They concluded that the GSR locus
is in the region 8pter-p21. Sinet et al. (1977) narrowed the assignment
to 8p21. The GSR locus has also been assigned by somatic cell
hybridization; it is one of the enzyme-markers for each chromosome
(table 1 in Shows and Sakaguchi, 1980), useful for synteny mapping.

Lohr and Waller (1962) observed a 'new' form of enzyme-deficiency
hemolytic anemia in which glutathione reductase was deficient and
glutathione (GSH) was low as a consequence. (This condition is
apparently distinct from that described by Oort et al. (1961) in which
GSH was also low, but glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione
reductase were normal.) Lohr (1963) observed 10 homozygotes and 5
heterozygotes in a family distribution consistent with autosomal
recessive inheritance. Blume et al. (1968) studied a kindred with many
persons who were demonstrably heterozygous by chemical test. Hampel et
al. (1969) found a markedly increased frequency of chromosomal
aberrations in a patient with pancytopenia and absent GSR-II band in the
electropherogram. The mother was hematologically normal but had absent
GSR-II band and a moderate increase in the frequency of chromosomal
aberrations. Addition of chloramphenicol to the cultures increased the
number of damaged chromosomes in both the mother and the son. Staal et
al. (1969) described a variety of glutathione reductase anemia in which
the variant enzyme had diminished affinity for flavin adenine
dinucleotide (FAD). The patient's anemia was corrected by vitamin B2.
Administration of flavin compounds to normal individuals or addition to
hemolysates of most normal persons causes an increase in activity of GSR
(Beutler, 1969). In a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus,
Fajnholc et al. (1971) found red cell GSR deficiency which was
correctable in vivo with riboflavin and in vitro with FAD. The same
deficiency was found in the mother and some of her relatives (who were
asymptomatic) but not in the father and his relatives. Enzyme kinetics
were normal. These workers concluded that the defect was not in the
apoenzyme. Loos et al. (1976) found virtually complete absence of GSR
activity in the erythrocytes of 3 children of a consanguineous marriage
and intermediate levels in the parents. Activity was not restored by FAD
in vitro or riboflavin in vivo. Clinically the deficiency was manifested
by favism in 1 child and by cataracts in 2. Reduced GSR was found in
leukocytes, as well as evidence of impaired bactericidal capacity, but
there was no history of repeated infections. Furthermore, Roos et al.
(1979) found that chemotaxis, phagocytosis of opsonized S. aureus, and
degranulation proceeded normally. Intracellular killing appeared normal
at low ratios of bacteria to phagocytes, but higher ratios resulted in
defective bacterial killing. GSR deficiency is a frequent occurrence in
northern Thailand. Flatz (1971) found a high frequency of GSR deficiency
in northern Thailand but concluded that it was probably secondary to
dietary riboflavin deficiency because activity of the enzyme was raised
markedly in most deficient persons by administration of riboflavin.
Studies of the families of 6 persons with poor response to riboflavin
gave no evidence supporting 'simple dominant inheritance,' and the
proband with low GSR values had no hematologic evidence of a hemolytic
tendency. Nevin et al. (1990) found increased GSR activity in a child
with an inverted tandem duplication of 8p23.1-p12.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a combination of behavioral analysis of 6 inbred mouse strains
with quantitative gene expression profiling of several brain regions,
Hovatta et al. (2005) identified 17 genes with expression patterns that
correlated with anxiety-like behavioral phenotypes. To determine if 2 of
the genes, glyoxalase-1 (138750) and glutathione reductase-1, have a
causal role in the genesis of anxiety, Hovatta et al. (2005) performed
genetic manipulation using lentivirus-mediated gene transfer. Local
overexpression of these genes in the mouse brain resulted in increased
anxiety-like behavior, while local inhibition of glyoxalase-1 expression
by RNA interference decreased the anxiety-like behavior. Hovatta et al.
(2005) concluded that both of these genes are involved in oxidative
stress metabolism, linking this pathway with anxiety-related behavior.

;;GLUTAMINYL CYCLASE; QC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glutaminyl cyclase (EC 2.3.2.5) converts glutaminyl peptides to cyclic
pyroglutamyl peptides.

CLONING

Using primers derived from the bovine QPCT sequence, Song et al. (1994)
cloned QPCT by PCR from a human pituitary cDNA library. The deduced
361-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 41 kD.
It contains an N-terminal signal peptide region, several glycosylation
and phosphorylation sites, and 2 cysteine residues conserved between the
bovine and human enzymes. QPCT shares 86% overall sequence identity with
the bovine homolog.

GENE FUNCTION

Through assays of the recombinant QPCT protein against a series of
glutaminyl peptides, Song et al. (1994) confirmed glutaminyl cyclase
activity and showed that QPCT has a bias against acidic and tryptophan
residues adjacent to the N-terminal glutaminyl residue.

Schilling et al. (2008) found that the N-terminal pyroglutamate (pE)
formation of amyloid-beta is catalyzed by glutaminyl cyclase in vivo.
Glutaminyl cyclase expression was upregulated in the cortices of
individuals with Alzheimer disease (104300) and correlated with the
appearance of pE-modified amyloid beta (104760). Oral application of a
glutaminyl cyclase inhibitor resulted in reduced amyloid beta(3(pE)-42)
burden in 2 different transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease and
in a new Drosophila model. Treatment of mice was accompanied by
reductions in amyloid beta(X-40/42), diminished plaque formation and
gliosis, and improved performance in context memory and spatial learning
tests. Schilling et al. (2008) suggested that their observations were
consistent with the hypothesis that amyloid beta(3(pE)-42) acts as a
seed for amyloid beta aggregation by self-aggregation and coaggregation
with amyloid beta(1-40/42). Therefore, amyloid beta(3(pE)-40/42)
peptides seem to represent amyloid beta forms with exceptional potency
for disturbing neuronal function. The authors suggested that the
reduction of brain pE-modified amyloid beta by inhibition of glutaminyl
cyclase offers a new therapeutic option for the treatment of Alzheimer
disease and provides implications for other amyloidoses.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the QPCT
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP TIGR-A002E27).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vetter and Wurst (2001) cloned mouse Uqcc, which they called Bfzb, and
identified its human homolog by database analysis. The deduced human and
mouse proteins have a single transmembrane domain and share 94% amino
acid identity. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos detected Bfzb
predominantly in the developing nervous system, with highest expression
in proliferating neuroepithelia of brain and neural tube, ganglia of
cranial nerves V, VII, VIII, IX, and X, and dorsal root ganglia.
Transcripts were also detected in developing eye and brown fat. In adult
mouse brain, strong expression was restricted to olfactory bulb,
hippocampus, and piriform cortex and Purkinje cells of cerebellum. The
Bfzb protein localized to cytoplasmic vesicular structures.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the UQCC gene to chromosome 20q11.22 based on an
alignment of the UQCC sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK001712) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The TCF3 gene, also called E2A, encodes 2 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription factors, E12 and E47, through alternative splicing. E12
and E47 are involved in regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression
(Bain et al., 1994).

CLONING

Expression of immunoglobulin genes depends on various sequence motifs in
their enhancer and promoter regions. One class of such sequences is the
E box, which is found in both heavy and light chain enhancers. The
kappa-E2 site has been shown to be important for light chain gene
transcription. To isolate cDNAs encoding kappa-E2-binding proteins,
Murre et al. (1989) screened a cDNA expression library derived from a
human B-cell lymphoma cell line (BJAB) with an oligonucleotide
containing a trimerized kappa-E2 site. They identified a partial cDNA
encoding a protein that they designated E12. Using the E12 cDNA to
rescreen the BJAB cDNA library, Murre et al. (1989) isolated a partial
cDNA encoding a protein that they designated E47. Sequence analysis
suggested that E12 and E47 are derived from a single gene, called E2A or
TCF3, via alternative splicing. E12 contains a leucine zipper; the
corresponding region of E47 was not cloned. Both the E12 and E47
proteins contain a region that is homologous to regions in MYOD
(159970), members of the MYC family (e.g., 190080), the Drosophila
'daughterless' gene product, and products of the Drosophila
'achaete-scute' and 'twist' gene families. The homologous regions have
the potential to form 2 amphipathic helices separated by an intervening
loop, and the hydrophobic residues present in the helices are highly
conserved.

Henthorn et al. (1990) independently cloned E2A and designated it ITF1.

GENE FUNCTION

Murre et al. (1989) showed that both E12 and E47 bound specifically to
the kappa-E2 sequence. They demonstrated that E47 bound kappa-E2 as a
dimer in vitro. Murre et al. (1989) demonstrated that the
helix-loop-helix motif of E12/E47 plays a crucial role in both
dimerization and DNA binding.

Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (101400) is an autosomal dominant
craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by premature fusion of coronal
sutures and limb abnormalities of variable severity. Mutations in TWIST
(601622), a class B basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor,
have been shown to be responsible for this phenotype. El Ghouzzi et al.
(2000) used a yeast 2-hybrid system to study interaction between TWIST
and E12, a potential partner in heterodimerization. Missense mutations
involving the helical domains of TWIST led to a complete loss of
heterodimerization with the E12 protein, and dramatically altered the
ability of the TWIST protein to localize in the nucleus of transfected
COS cells. The authors hypothesized that the E12-TWIST heterodimer may
serve as a negative regulator of transcription in osteoblastic cells.

TAL1 (187040) is necessary for establishment of the hematopoietic system
and can either activate or repress transcription depending upon other
factors recruited to TAL1-nucleated complexes. Goardon et al. (2006)
found that ETO2 (CBFA2T3; 603870) copurified with TAL1 complexes in
human and mouse erythroleukemia cells. Protein pull-down assays revealed
that ETO2 interacted with E2A and HEB (TCF12; 600480) within the TAL1
complex, but not with TAL1 itself. ETO2 also interacted with E2A in
erythroid cells independent of the TAL1 complex. Reporter gene assays
revealed that ETO2 repressed the transcriptional activity of the
complex. The ETO2 content in TAL1 complexes was high during the
proliferative phase in erythroid cells. In contrast, ETO2 was
downregulated upon terminal differentiation, concomitant with appearance
of histone modifications associated with gene activation and expression
of glycophorin A (GPA; 111300) and band 4.2 (EPB42; 177070), which are
markers of erythrocyte maturation. Knockdown of ETO2 via small
interfering RNA induced growth arrest and differentiation in human and
mouse erythroid progenitors. Goardon et al. (2006) concluded that ETO2
is required for expansion of erythroid progenitors, but that it is
dispensable for terminal maturation. They proposed that the
stoichiometry of ETO2 with the TAL1 complex controls the transition from
erythroid progenitor expansion to terminal differentiation.

The vitamin D receptor-interacting repressor (VDIR), a basic
helix-loop-helix transcription activator, regulates the transcription of
CYP27B1 (609506) by binding to the negative vitamin D response element
(nVDRE) in the CYP27B1 promoter (Kim et al., 2007).

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization and Southern analysis of rodent-human somatic
cell hybrids, Mellentin et al. (1989) demonstrated that the E2A gene
maps to 19p13.3-p13.2, a site associated with nonrandom translocations
in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL; 613065). By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Trask et al. (1993) assigned the TCF3 gene to 19p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in TCF3, IKZF1 (603023), IKZF3 (606221), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

CYTOGENETICS

Evidence presented by Mellentin et al. (1989) suggested that most, and
perhaps all, t(1;19)(q23;p13) chromosomal translocations, a frequent
cytogenetic change in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, contain
rearrangements of the E2A gene.

Hunger (1996) reviewed clinical features and the molecular pathogenesis
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) caused by chromosomal
translocations involving the E2A gene. E2A proteins play an
indispensable role in B-cell lymphopoiesis. The pathogenesis of a subset
of B-precursor ALLs involves replacement of the bHLH regions of the E2A
protein with heterologous DNA-binding domains.

- E2A/PBX1 Fusion Gene

Nourse et al. (1990) detected altered E2A transcripts, which lacked
sequences encoding the helix-loop-helix DNA-binding motif, in several
t(1;19)-carrying cell lines. They cloned fusion cDNAs that crossed the
t(1;19) breakpoint. These cDNAs encode an 85-kD protein consisting of
the N-terminal two-thirds of E2A fused to a chromosome 1-derived
protein. The fusion protein has the features of a chimeric transcription
factor in which the DNA-binding domain of E2A is replaced by the
putative DNA-binding domain of a homeoprotein from chromosome 1, which
Nourse et al. (1990) named PRL (PBX1; 176310) for 'pre-B cell leukemia.'
By PCR of 3 t(1;19)-carrying cell lines, the authors detected identical
E2A-PRL mRNA junctions, indicating that the fusion transcripts and
predicted chimeric protein are a consistent feature of this
translocation.

Kamps et al. (1990) found that a cell line with a t(1;19)(q23;p13.3)
translocation contains 2 novel chimeric mRNAs, both with the same
5-prime E2A sequences but with different lengths of 3-prime sequence
from a gene located on chromosome 1, which they called PRL (PBX1). The
chimeric RNAs encode proteins that lack 171 amino acids of E2A,
including its DNA-binding and dimerization motifs, but have instead a
homeobox-related sequence from PRL. Kamps et al. (1990) suggested that
the production of a chimeric E2A-PRL protein may contribute to the acute
lymphoblastic phenotype by directly altering the expression of genes
normally responsive to the PRL homeoprotein.

Wiemels et al. (2002) sequenced the genomic fusion between the E2A and
PBX1 genes in 22 pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemias and 2 cell lines.
The prenatal origin of the leukemia was assessed in 15 pediatric
patients by screening for the clonotypic E2A-PBX1 translocation in
neonatal blood spots, or Guthrie cards, obtained from the children at
birth. Two patients were weakly positive for the fusion at birth, in
contrast to previously studied childhood leukemia fusions, t(12;21),
t(8;21), and t(4;11), which are predominantly prenatal. The presence of
extensive N-nucleotides at the point of fusion in the E2A-PBX1
translocation as well as specific characteristics of the IGH
(147100)/TCR (see 186880) rearrangements provided additional evidence
for a postnatal, pre-B cell origin. Sixteen of 24 breakpoints on the
3.2-kb E2A intron 14 were located within 5 bp, providing evidence for a
site-specific recombination mechanism. Breakpoints on the 232-kb PBX1
intron 1 were more dispersed, but were highly clustered proximal to exon
2. Thus, the translocation breakpoints displayed evidence of unique
temporal, ontologic, and mechanistic formation in contrast to the
previously analyzed pediatric leukemia translocation breakpoints,
emphasizing the need to differentiate cytogenetic and molecular
subgroups for studies of leukemia causality.

- E2A/HLF Fusion Gene

Inaba et al. (1992) showed that a t(17;19) chromosomal translocation in
early B-lineage acute leukemia resulted in chimeric transcripts that
contained sequences from the E2A basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
transcription factor gene on chromosome 19, fused to sequences from a
gene on chromosome 17 that encodes a hepatic leukemia factor (HLF;
142385). The chimeric protein consisted of the amino-terminal
transactivation domain of E2A linked to the carboxyl-terminal basic
region-leucine zipper domain of HLF.

Kurosawa et al. (1999) found that E2A/HLF upregulated expression of
SRPUL (SRPX2; 300642) and annexin-8 (ANXA8; 602396) in pro-B cells.
Transfection of a human myeloid leukemia cell line with E2A/HLF induced
expression of ANXA8, but not SRPUL. E2A/HLF protected mouse pro-B cells
from apoptosis caused by IL3 (147740) deprivation, but neither ANXA8 or
SRPUL could block apoptosis, suggesting that they are not involved in
malignant transformation.

Using representational difference analysis, Dang et al. (2001) found
that the E2A/HLF fusion protein upregulated expression of several
groucho-related genes (GRGs), including Grg2 and Grg6 (TLE6; 612399),
following expression in a mouse pro-B cell line. A mutant E2A/HLF
protein lacking DNA-binding activity also stimulated expression of GRGs.
Among the transcription factors that interact with GRG proteins, only
Runx1 (151385) was appreciably downregulated by E2A/HLF.

- E2A/TFPT Fusion Gene

Brambillasca et al. (1999) identified 4 cases of acute lymphoblastic
leukemia displaying E2A/FB1 (TFPT; 609519) chimeric transcripts that
appeared to originate from a cryptic rearrangement of chromosome 19. The
5-prime portion of E2A was interrupted at different positions within
exons 13 or 14 and fused to FB1. The fusion was in-frame in 1 case, and
the remaining cases showed out-of-frame fusions leading to stop codons
in FB1 or to truncation of the predicted chimeric product. Brambillasca
et al. (1999) found no evidence of reciprocal chimeric transcripts.

ANIMAL MODEL

Heterodimers between tissue-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
proteins and the products of the E2A gene play major roles in
determining tissue-specific cell fate. The E2A gene gives rise to 2
proteins, E12 and E47, by differential splicing of E12- and E47-specific
bHLH-encoding exons. Although they were initially identified in B cells
as immunoglobulin enhancer-binding proteins, they were subsequently
found to be present in most cell types. To understand the broad role of
E2A in development, Zhuang et al. (1994) generated E2A mutant mice
following homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Homozygous
mutant mice developed to full term without apparent abnormalities, but
then displayed a high rate of postnatal death. The surviving mice showed
retarded postnatal growth. Detailed examination of hematopoiesis
revealed that the homozygous mutant mice contained no B cells, whereas
other lineages, including the T cell, granulocyte, macrophage, and
erythroid lineages, were intact. The block to B-cell differentiation
occurred before the immunoglobulin gene D(H)-J(H) rearrangement.
Surprisingly, heterozygous embryos contained, on average, about half as
many B cells as did wildtype embryos, suggesting the existence of a
counting mechanism that translates levels of E2A into numbers of B
cells.

Sun (1994) generated transgenic mice in which the Id1 gene (600349) was
constitutively overexpressed in the B-cell lineage. The product of this
gene is an inhibitor of the DNA-binding activity of bHLH proteins such
as the E2A gene product. The phenotype of these transgenic mice depicted
severe defects in early B-cell development, suggesting that the bHLH
proteins play pivotal roles in B-cell development and that the
downregulation of Id1 gene expression is necessary for B cells to
differentiate.

Bain et al. (1994) likewise generated E2A-null mice by gene targeting
and found that they failed to generate mature B cells. The arrest of
B-cell development occurred at an early stage since no immunoglobulin DJ
rearrangements could be detected. The finding suggested a crucial role
for E2A products in the regulation of early B-cell differentiation.

To investigate the biologic role of the E2A-HLF fusion gene, Honda et
al. (1999) generated transgenic mice expressing E2A-HLF in the lymphoid
lineage. The transgenic mice exhibited abnormal development in the
thymus and spleen and were susceptible to infection. The thymus
contained small numbers of thymocytes and showed a high population of
thymocytes undergoing apoptosis. The spleen exhibited a marked reduction
in lymphocytes, and studies showed that B-cell maturation was blocked at
a very early developmental stage. Several transgenic mice developed
acute leukemia, classified as T-ALL. Smith et al. (1999) likewise
studied the function of the fusion gene in transgenic mice.
Approximately 60% of E2A-HLF mice developed lymphoid malignancies with a
mean latency of 10 months. Tumors were monoclonal, consistent with the
requirement for secondary genetic events. Smith et al. (1999) concluded
that the fusion gene disrupts the differentiation of T-lymphoid
precursors in vivo, leading to profound postnatal thymic depletion and
rendering B- and T-cell progenitors susceptible to malignant
transformation.

NOMENCLATURE

The TCF3 gene, also known as E2A, should not be confused with the the
TCF7L1 gene (604652), which was initially designated TCF3. TCF3 encodes
the bHLH transcription factors E12 and E47, whereas TCF7L1 encodes a
TCF/LEF transcription factor involved in Wnt (see 164820) signaling.

;;ICHTHYIN; ICHYN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By in silico analyses, Lefevre et al. (2004) cloned NIPAL4, which they
called ichthyin. The deduced 404-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 44 kD. The protein has several putative transmembrane
domains and shares approximately 75% sequence identity with the mouse
and rat orthologs. It is predicted to localize in the plasma membrane,
but does not possess a signal sequence. RT-PCR detected expression of
ichthyin at high levels in brain, lung, stomach, skin, and leukocytes,
and in all other tissues tested except liver, thyroid, and fetal brain,
in which no expression was detectable. Strong expression was observed in
cultured keratinocytes from normal skin biopsies; expression was weaker
in cultured fibroblasts from the same skin biopsies, in placenta and in
lymphocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lefevre et al. (2004) determined that the NIPAL4 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

By in silico and sequence analyses, Lefevre et al. (2004) mapped the
NIPAL4 gene to chromosome 5q33.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 23 patients from 14 consanguineous families with nonsyndromic
autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI6; 612281), Lefevre et
al. (2004) identified 6 homozygous mutations in the NIPAL4 gene (see,
e.g., 609383.0001-609383.0002).

Dahlqvist et al. (2007) studied 27 patients from 18 ARCI families with
the specific ultrastructural features of the epidermis that characterize
electron microscopy-analyzed ichthyosis designated type III (EM type
III). Mutation screening of NIPAL4 revealed 4 different missense or
splice site mutations (see, e.g., 609383.0003-609383.0004) in affected
members from 16 of 18 (89%) families with these characteristics of ARCI
EM type III.

In affected members of 3 consanguineous Algerian families with autosomal
recessive congenital ichthyosis-6 (ARCI6; 612281), Lefevre et al. (2004)
identified a homozygous 247C-T transition in exon 2 of the NIPAL4 gene,
resulting in an arg83-to-ter (R83X) substitution.

In affected members of 7 consanguineous families with autosomal

identified a homozygous 341C-A transversion in exon 4 of the NIPAL4
gene, resulting in an ala114-to-asn (A114N) substitution. One of the
families was from Colombia, 3 were from Turkey, and 3 were from Algeria.

In a study of 27 patients from 18 families with autosomal recessive
congenital ichthyosis-6 (612281) characterized by electron microscopy
(EM) as type III (ARCI EM type III), with abnormal lamellar bodies in
stratum granulosum and perinuclear, elongated membranes, Dahlqvist et
al. (2007) found a 527C-to-A transversion in exon 4 of the NIPAL4 cDNA
that led to an ala176-to-asp (A176D) amino acid substitution. The
mutation was found in 37 of the 54 alleles examined.

ICHTHYOSIS, CONGENITAL, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE 6
NIPAL4, IVS5, G-A, +1

In a patient with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis-6 (612281),
Dahlqvist et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the splice donor site of exon 5 of the NIPAL4 gene, and an
A176D mutation (609383.0003). DNA sequencing showed that the mutant mRNA
retained 68 nucleotides of intronic sequence by the activation of a
cryptic splice site, which resulted in a premature stop codon.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NHE3 (SLC9A3; 182307) is a sodium/hydrogen exchanger in the brush border
membrane of the proximal tubule, small intestine, and colon that plays a
major role in transepithelial sodium absorption. SLC9A3R2, as well as
SLC9A3R1 (604990) and protein kinase A phosphorylation, may play a role
in NHE3 regulation.

CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library with SRY
(480000) as bait, Poulat et al. (1997) obtained a cDNA encoding
SLC9A3R2, which they termed SIP1. The deduced 326-amino acid protein
contains 2 highly conserved PDZ domains. Northern blot analysis revealed
wide expression of SLC9A3R2, suggesting a function not restricted to the
sex-determination process. Western blot analysis showed expression of a
34-kD protein. Binding and mutational analyses confirmed the interaction
of the PDZ domains of SLC9A3R2 with the C terminus of SRY.
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated nuclear expression of
SLC9A3R2.

By means of a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a lung fibroblast cDNA library
with the cytoplasmic tail of NHE3 as bait, Yun et al. (1997) isolated a
cDNA encoding SLC9A3R2, which they designated E3KARP. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 337-amino acid protein is 55% identical to SLC9A3R1
(Reczek et al., 1997). Yun et al. (1997) concluded that either E3KARP or
EBP50 (SLC9A3R1) is necessary for the cAMP-dependent inhibition of NHE3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Hall et al. (1998) determined that the DS/TxL motif at the cytoplasmic
tail of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2; 109690), P2Y1 (601167),
and CFTR (602421) is necessary for interaction with the first PDZ domain
of NHERF (SLC9A3R1) and NHERF2. They suggested that the presence of this
motif at the C terminus of a variety of proteins is a useful indicator
of potential NHERF binding to intracellular proteins.

Yun et al. (1998) showed that a central domain of NHE3, not a C-terminal
domain, interacts with NHERF2 through its second PDZ domain plus its C
terminus. Confocal microscopy demonstrated predominantly cytosolic
expression of NHERF2 in the absence of NHE3, with more plasma membrane
expression in the presence of NHE3. Gel overlay analysis showed that, as
seen with NHERF, the N terminus of ezrin (VIL2; 123900) interacts with
the C-terminal residues of NHERF2.

GENE FUNCTION

Mahon et al. (2002) demonstrated that parathyroid hormone receptor-1
(PTHR1; 168468) binds to the sodium/hydrogen exchanger regulatory
factors NHERF1 (604990) and NHERF2 through a PDZ-domain interaction in
vitro and in PTH target cells. NHERF2 simultaneously binds phospholipase
C-beta-1 and an atypical, carboxyl-terminal PDZ consensus motif, ETVM,
of the PTHR1 through PDZ1 and PDZ2, respectively. PTH treatment of cells
that express the NHERF2-PTH1R complex markedly activated phospholipase
C-beta and inhibits adenylylcyclase through stimulation of inhibitory G
proteins (see 139310). NHERF-mediated assembly of PTHR1 and
phospholipase C-beta is a unique mechanism to regulate PTH signaling in
cells and membranes of polarized cells that express NHERF, which may
account for many tissue- and cell-specific actions of PTH/PTH-related
protein (168470) and may also be relevant to signaling by many G
protein-coupled receptors.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human brain cDNA expression library,
DeMarco et al. (2002) found that PCMA2b (108733) interacted with NHERF2.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicated that the interaction was
specific and selective, in that PCMA4b (108732) did not interact with
either NHERF2 or NHERF1, and PCMA2b preferred NHERF2 over NHERF1.
Fluorescence-tagged PCMA2b was expressed at the apical membrane of
canine kidney epithelial cells, where it colocalized with apically
targeted NHERF2. DeMarco et al. (2002) hypothesized that the
PCMA2b-NHERF2 interaction may allow the assembly of PMCA2b in a
multiprotein Ca(2+) signaling complex.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a rat glomerular cDNA library, Takeda
et al. (2001) found that the PDZ-binding motif in the cytoplasmic
C-terminal tail of rat podocalyxin (PODXL; 602632) bound the second PDZ
domain of Nherf2. Immunocytochemical analysis colocalized Nherf2 with
podocalyxin and ezrin along the apical domain of the glomerular
epithelial cell membrane. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that
Nherf2 and ezrin formed a multimeric complex with podocalyxin. The
complex interacted with the actin cytoskeleton, and this interaction was
disrupted in glomerular epithelial cells from rats treated with agents
that cause loss of foot processes. Takeda et al. (2001) concluded that
NHERF2 functions as a scaffold protein linking podocalyxin to ezrin and
the actin cytoskeleton.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis of the 3-prime-flanking sequence of the NTHL1 gene
(602656), Imai et al. (1998) mapped the SLC9A3R2 gene to an adjacent
region on chromosome 16p13.3.

;;LAMININ RECEPTOR 1; LAMR1;;
LAMBR;;
LAMININ RECEPTOR, 67-KD; 67LR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Gehlsen et al. (1988) isolated a receptor for the adhesive basement
membrane protein laminin (150290, 150310, 150320) from human
glioblastoma cells by affinity chromatography on laminin. These RuGli
glioblastoma cells were later shown to be rat cells (Gehlsen et al.,
1988). This receptor has a heterodimeric structure similar to that of
receptors for other extracellular matrix proteins such as the
fibronectin (135620) and vitronectin (193210) receptors. Incorporation
of the laminin receptor into lysosomal membranes made it possible for
lysosomes to attach to surfaces coated with laminin.

Bignon et al. (1991) cloned 2 cDNAs for the human 67-kD laminin
receptor. They found that these clones hybridize to many restriction
fragments in Southern blot analyses in the human. The particular
patterns were accounted for by the presence of up to 16 and 21 copies of
the laminin receptor gene per haploid genome in human and mouse,
respectively. In contrast, a single gene copy was found in the chicken.

Yow et al. (1988) cloned a human colon carcinoma cDNA encoding a
laminin-binding protein. The cDNA hybridized to a 1.2-kb transcript, the
level of which was approximately 9-fold higher in colon carcinoma than
in adjacent normal colonic epithelium. The deduced 295-amino acid
protein has a highly negatively charged C-terminal segment and lacks
consensus sequences for an N-terminal signal sequence, amphipathic
alpha-helices, and N-glycosylation sites.

Satoh et al. (1992) cloned cDNAs encoding the 67-kD laminin receptor
from both a human lung cell line and a human lung cancer cell line. They
demonstrated that the level of the laminin receptor transcript was
higher in the lung cancer cell line than in the lung cell line.

Tohgo et al. (1994) found that the amino acid sequence of the rat 40S
ribosomal subunit is 99% identical to that of the human 68-kD
laminin-binding protein, indicating that the 40S ribosomal subunit is
identical to the 68-kD laminin-binding protein.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Jackers et al. (1996) localized
the LAMR1 gene to 3p21.3. Kenmochi et al. (1998) mapped the LAMR1 gene,
which they called RPSA, to 3p using somatic cell hybrid and radiation
hybrid mapping panels.

Bignon et al. (1991) identified laminin receptor pseudogenes on
chromosomes 3, 12, 14, and X. The features suggested that the laminin
receptor gene belongs to a retroposon family in mammals.

Lafreniere et al. (1993) demonstrated that a laminin receptor
pseudogene, which they symbolized LAMRP4, is located at Xq13 in a 2.6-Mb
segment that also contains the XIST gene (314670).

GENE STRUCTURE

The 37-kD precursor of the 67-kD laminin receptor (37LRP) is a
polypeptide whose expression is consistently upregulated in aggressive
carcinoma. It appears to be a multifunctional protein involved in the
translational machinery; it has also been identified as p40
ribosome-associated protein. Jackers et al. (1996) isolated the active
37LRP/p40 human gene. They found that it contains 7 exons and 6 introns.
Ribonuclease protection experiments suggested multiple transcription
start sites. The promoter area does not bear a TATA box but contains 4
Sp1 sites. The first intron is also GC-rich, containing 5 Sp1 sites.
Intron 4 contains a full sequence of the small nucleolar E2 RNA (RNE2;
180646) between nucleotides 4365 and 4516, and intron 3 contains 2 Alu
sequences.

GENE FUNCTION

Montuori et al. (1999) investigated the expression of integrin laminin
receptors in normal thyroid primary cultures; immortalized normal
thyroid cells (TAD-2); papillary (NPA), follicular (WRO), and anaplastic
(ARO) thyroid tumor cell lines; 7 thyroid tumors (4 papillary and 3
follicular carcinomas); and normal thyroid glands. Despite the presence
of several integrin laminin receptors, adhesion of TAD-2, NPA, and ARO
cells to immobilized laminin-1 was poor, whereas WRO cells and
follicular carcinoma-derived cells displayed a strong adhesion. Indeed,
WRO and follicular carcinoma-derived cells showed expression of a
nonintegrin laminin receptor, the 67-kD high-affinity laminin receptor
(67LR). TAD-2, NPA, and ARO cells as well as nodular goiter, toxic
adenoma, follicular adenoma, and papillary carcinoma-derived cells did
not express the 67LR. The expression in follicular carcinoma cells of a
functional, high-affinity 67LR, together with nonfunctional integrin
laminin receptors, could be responsible for the tendency of follicular
carcinoma cells to metastasize by mediating stable contacts with basal
membranes.

Chen et al. (2002) found that human normal and leukemic T cells produce
GNRH2 (602352) and GNRH1 (152760). Exposure of normal or cancerous human
or mouse T cells to GNRH2 or GNRH1 triggered de novo gene transcription
and cell-surface expression of the laminin receptor, which is involved
in cellular adhesion and migration and in tumor invasion and metastasis.
GNRH2 or GNRH1 also induced adhesion to laminin and chemotaxis toward
SDF1A (600835), and augmented entry in vivo of metastatic T-lymphoma
into the spleen and bone marrow. Homing of normal T cells into specific
organs was reduced in mice lacking GNRH1. A specific GNRH1 receptor
antagonist blocked GNRH1 but not GNRH2-induced effects, which was
suggestive of signaling through distinct receptors. Chen et al. (2002)
suggested that GNRH2 and GNRH1, secreted from nerves or autocrine or
paracrine sources, interact directly with T cells and trigger gene
transcription, adhesion, chemotaxis, and homing to specific organs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bolze et al. (2013) demonstrated that heterozygous mutations in the RPSA
gene cause autosomal dominant isolated congenital asplenia (271400) by
haploinsufficiency, revealing an essential role for RPSA in human spleen
development. Bolze et al. (2013) identified a nonsense mutation, a
frameshift duplication, and 5 different missense mutations. These 7
mutations were not identified in more than 10,000 alleles reported in
the 1,000 Genomes Project or the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. The
missense mutations affected residues strictly conserved in mammals,
vertebrates, and yeast.

ANIMAL MODEL

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD; 107970) is a
hereditary cardiomyopathy that causes sudden death in the young. Asano
et al. (2004) found a line of mice with inherited right ventricular
dysplasia (RVD) caused by mutation of the gene laminin receptor-1
(Lamr1). This locus contained an intron-processing retroposon that was
transcribed in the mice with RVD. Introduction of a mutated Lamr1 gene
into normal mice by breeding or by direct injection caused
susceptibility to RVD, which was similar to that seen in the RVD mice.
An in vitro study of cardiomyocytes expressing the product of mutated
Lamr1 showed early cell death accompanied by alteration of the chromatin
architecture. They found that heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1; 604478)
bound specifically to mutant Lamr1. HP1 is a dynamic regulator of
heterochromatin sites, suggesting that mutant LAMR1 impairs a crucial
process of transcriptional regulation. Indeed, mutant Lamr1 caused
specific changes to gene expression in cardiomyocytes, as detected by
gene chip analysis. Asano et al. (2004) concluded that products of the
Lamr1 transposon interact with HP1 to cause degeneration of
cardiomyocytes. This mechanism may also contribute to the etiology of
human ARVD. They noted that the human LAMR1 gene maps to 3p21 and that a
form of ARVD, ARVD5 (604400), maps to 3p23.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, GLN9TER

In affected members of a Caucasian family from the United States
(kindred E) with isolated congenital asplenia (271400), Bolze et al.
(2013) identified heterozygosity for a c.25C-T transition in the RPSA
gene that resulted in a nonsense mutation, gln9 to ter (Q9X). The
mutation segregated in the mother and son and was presumably present in
2 other sibs who had died of overwhelming infection.

.0002
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, 5-BP DUP, 590TCATG

In a mother and 2 sons (kindred C) with isolated congenital asplenia
(271400), Bolze et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a 5-bp
duplication in exon 5 of the RPSA gene (c.590_594dup) that resulted in
frameshift and premature termination (Pro199SerfsTer25). Cloning and
analysis of protein generated from activated T cells from patients
showed that less than 10% of the transcripts carried the mutation, which
suggested that mutant mRNAs were subject to nonsense-mediated decay. The
mother was Caucasian and the father was of Tamil descent from Reunion
Island. This family had been reported by Mahlaoui et al. (2011) as
family D.

.0003
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, ARG180GLY

In affected members of 2 families (kindreds D and A) with isolated
congenital asplenia (271400), Bolze et al. (2013) detected
heterozygosity for a c.538C-G transversion in the RPSA gene that
resulted in an arg180-to-gly substitution (R180G). Haplotype analysis
indicated that the mutation arose independently in each kindred. In
kindred A, affected individuals occurred in 3 generations.

.0004
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, ARG180TRP

In a Caucasian individual from Sweden (kindred T) with isolated
congenital asplenia (271400), Bolze et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a 538C-T transition in the RPSA gene that resulted in
an arg180-to-trp substitution (R180W). Since neither parent carried the
mutation and the patient had 3 unaffected sibs, the mutation was
presumed to have arisen de novo.

.0005
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, ARG186CYS

In a family of Congolese origin (kindred B) with 3 affected members with
isolated congenital asplenia (271400), Bolze et al. (2013) identified a
heterozygous c.556C-T transition in the RPSA gene that resulted in an
arg186-to-cys substitution (R186C). This family had been reported by
Mahlaoui et al. (2011) as family E and had been reported by Koss et al.
(2012) as having a causative mutation in the NKX2-5 gene (600584.0024).
The RPSA mutation segregated with the disease in a father and 2 sons,
one deceased; 3 other deceased sibs were probably affected. Koss et al.
(2012) presented a case report of this family. Three children died of
fulminant infection within the first year of life; they were not further
studied. A fourth child died of sepsis at age 23 months. Postmortem
examination of this child showed asplenia with normal heart and visceral
placement, and mutation analysis identified the P236H mutation. The
fifth child and the father, who both carried the mutation, were found to
have ICAS; the child was placed on prophylaxis, whereas the father did
not have a history of infections, suggesting incomplete penetrance.
Studies in mouse embryos and cellular studies of splenic mesenchymal
cells demonstrated a pivotal role for the NKX2-5 gene in spleen
development.

.0006
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, THR54ASN

In 2 affected children with isolated congenital asplenia (271400) from a
Caucasian French family (kindred F), Bolze et al. (2013) identified
heterozygosity for a c.161C-A transversion in the RPSA gene that
resulted in a thr54-to-asn substitution (T54N). Since neither parent was
found to carry the mutation, inheritance was attributed to germline
mosaicism. This family had been reported by Mahlaoui et al. (2011) as
family B, and by Ferlicot et al. (1997).

.0007
ASPLENIA, ISOLATED CONGENITAL
RPSA, LEU58PHE

In an individual of French descent (kindred O) with isolated congenital
asplenia (271400), Bolze et al. (2013) identified heterozygosity for a
c.172C-T transition in the RPSA gene that resulted in a leu58-to-phe
substitution (L58F). The mutation apparently arose de novo.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Entry of the poliovirus into permissive cells is dependent on the
expression of a specific receptor, the poliovirus receptor (PVR;
173850), which is an integral membrane glycoprotein. Its extracellular
region exhibits 3 immunoglobulin-like domains. Two integral forms,
PVR-alpha and PVR-delta, and 2 soluble forms, PVR-beta and PVR-gamma,
are lacking a transmembrane region generated by alternative splicing of
mRNA. The normal cellular function of PVR is unknown. The identification
of human PVR prompted study of its counterpart in other species. In the
monkey, 2 genes located at 2 separate genetic loci, AGM1 and AGM2, have
been cloned. AGM1 encodes 2 membrane-bound splice variant forms
homologous to PVR-alpha and PVR-delta. AGM2 encodes a membrane-bound
form, PVR-alpha-2. Morrison and Racaniello (1992) described a murine
gene, Mph, as a structural homolog of human PVR. Two Mph molecules,
Mph-alpha and Mph-beta, are thought to be generated by alternative
splicing from a primary transcript.

Following the discovery of the human PVR-related gene (PVRR1; 600644),
other PVR-related molecules were sought. Using degenerate
oligonucleotides in a PCR-based methodology, Eberle et al. (1995)
identified a second PVR-related cDNA, which they called PRR2.
Furthermore, they presented evidence that PRR2, and not PVR, is the
homolog of Mph, and questioned the existence of a true murine homolog of
PVR. The PRR2 gene encodes 2 glycoproteins, PRR2-alpha (short form) and
PRR2-delta (long form), which have 69% and 73% identity within Mph-alpha
and Mph-beta, respectively. In contrast, the human PVR protein exhibits
only 51% identity which is, moreover, restricted to the 3 immunoglobulin
domains of the murine protein. Northern blot analysis showed that 2 mRNA
isoforms of 3.0 kb (PRR2-alpha) and 4.4 kb (PRR2-delta) are ubiquitously
found in various normal human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Bottino et al. (2003) immunized mice with natural killer
(NK)-susceptible human target cells and obtained antibodies to PVR and
PVRL2. Binding analysis and flow cytometry demonstrated that both
molecules bound strongly with DNAM1 (CD226; 605397), but not with other
activating NK receptors, including NKp46 (NCR1; 604530) and NKp30 (NCR3;
611550). Expression of PVR or PVRL2 rendered cells susceptible to
enhanced lysis in a DNAM1-dependent manner that was nearly abrogated in
the presence of antibody to PVR, PVRL2, or DNAM1.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Liu et al. (2012) generated the crystal structure of the nectin-2
Ig-like V-set domain at 1.85-angstrom resolution. The structure bound to
both the soluble ectodomain of DNAM1 and cell surface-expressed
full-length DNAM1. Mutational analysis revealed that disruption of the
homodimeric interface of nectin-2 led to failure of homodimer formation
and loss of binding to DNAM1.

MAPPING

By isotopic hybridization, Eberle et al. (1995) mapped the PRR2 gene to
19q13.2-q13.4 in the same chromosomal region as PVR. By genomic sequence
analysis, Freitas et al. (1998) mapped the PRR2 gene to chromosome
19q13.2, where it lies centromeric to the TOMM40 gene (608061) and the
APOE (107741)-APOC2 (608083) gene cluster.

605342	TITLE *605342 PAIRED IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE TYPE 2 RECEPTOR, BETA; PILRB
DESCRIPTION For background information, see PILRA (605341).

CLONING

By 5-prime RACE analysis of PILRA, Mousseau et al. (2000) identified a
cDNA encoding PILRB. PILRB encodes a protein with similar extracellular
features as PILRA but has a short cytoplasmic tail and a charged lysine
residue within its transmembrane domain, suggesting that it may be an
activating rather than an inhibitory receptor. RT-PCR analysis indicated
that PILRA and PILRB are expressed, or paired, at the mRNA level in
various tissues.

Shiratori et al. (2004) cloned and characterized mouse Pilrb.

GENE FUNCTION

Shiratori et al. (2004) identified a novel CD99 (313470)-like ligand for
mouse Pilrb that they termed Pilrl. Cells expressing Pilrl specifically
activated natural killer cells and dendritic cells expressing Pilrb.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Mousseau et al. (2000) determined that the
PILRB gene contains only 4 exons spanning approximately 9.8 kb, whereas
PILRA has 7 exons.

MAPPING

By long-range PCR on genomic DNA and comparison to a chromosome 7
segment (GenBank GENBANK RG161A02), Mousseau et al. (2000) mapped the
PILRB gene to chromosome 7, 5.6 kb upstream from PILRA.

;;PTP-ALPHA; PTPA;;
RPTPase-ALPHA;;
LCA-RELATED PHOSPHATASE; LRP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vital cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and signal
transduction, are regulated in part by the balance between the
activities of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs; see 147795) and
protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases; EC 3.1.3.48). PTPases can be
divided into 2 classes: small, soluble enzymes containing a single
conserved PTPase domain, such as T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase
(PTPT; 176887), and larger, more complex receptor-linked PTPases
containing 2 tandem PTPase domains. PTPRA belongs to the latter group,
which also includes leukocyte common antigen (LCA, or PTPRC; 151460) and
leukocyte antigen-related tyrosine phosphatase (LAR, or PTPRF; 179590)
(summary by Kaplan et al. (1990)).

CLONING

By screening a hepatoblastoma cell line cDNA library with probes
corresponding to the PTPase domains of mouse Ptprc, Jirik et al. (1990)
cloned human PTPRA, which they called LRP. The predicted 793-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 87.5 kD (unglycosylated). The
protein contains a leader peptide, followed by a 121-residue
extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment, and 2 tandem
intracytoplasmic catalytic domains. The extracellular region has 8
potential N-glycosylation sites and multiple O-glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected 2 LRP transcripts of 3.0 to 3.5 kb in
all human cell cell lines examined. Ubiquitous expression was also
detected in mouse tissues and cell lines.

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with Drosophila Ptp, Krueger
et al. (1990) cloned several PTPases, including PTPRA, which they called
PTP-alpha. The deduced 793-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal
peptide, followed by an extracellular domain, a transmembrane segment,
and a cytoplasmic region containing duplicate PTPase-like domains.
PTP-alpha is rich in serine and threonine and has multiple potential
N-glycosylation sites.

By screening a human brainstem cDNA library with a leukocyte common
antigen (LCA, or PTPRC; 151460) probe, Kaplan et al. (1990) cloned
PTPRA, which they called RPTPase-alpha. The deduced protein contains 802
amino acids. Outside of the extracellular domain, where some variability
exists, human PTPRA differs from mouse Ptpra at only 5 amino acids.
Northern blot analysis detected 4.3- and 6.3-kb transcripts in various
human cell lines and tissues, with the larger transcript being more
prevalent in fetal tissues.

Matthews et al. (1990) cloned mouse Ptpra, which they called Lrp. The
deduced 793-amino acid protein has an N-terminal leader sequence,
followed by an extracellular domain, a membrane-spanning region, and a
cytoplasmic domain with 2 conserved tyrosine phosphatase catalytic
domains. The extracellular region was predicted to be highly
glycosylated. Matthews et al. (1990) also identified an Lrp splice
variant containing an insertion that preserves the reading frame but
disrupts the first tyrosine phosphatase domain. RNA transfer blot
analysis detected wide expression of Lrp in mouse tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the cytoplasmic segment of human PTP-alpha expressed in E. coli,
Krueger et al. (1990) confirmed that PTP-alpha had robust PTPase
activity against phosphorylated test substrates.

MAPPING

By study of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids, Jirik et al. (1990)
mapped the PTPRA gene to chromosome 20p13. Other family members located
on chromosome 20 include SRC (190090), HCK (142370), and PTP1B (176885).
Kaplan et al. (1990) localized the PTPRA gene to chromosome 20pter-20q12
by analysis of its segregation pattern in rodent-human somatic cell
hybrids. Rao et al. (1992) regionalized the assignment of PTPA to the
distal portion of chromosome 20p (20pter-p12) by both radioactive and
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By in situ hybridization, Jirik et
al. (1992) localized the PTPA gene to chromosome 20p13.

Schnittger et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Ptpra gene to chromosome 2,
confirming the exceptional homology between human chromosome 20 and the
distal segment of mouse chromosome 2.

300601	TITLE *300601 G ANTIGEN 7; GAGE7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Many human tumors express antigens that are recognized in vitro by
cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) derived from the tumor-bearing patient.
The MAGE (melanoma-specific antigen) and GAGE (G antigen) gene family
members encode such antigens. To screen for genes associated with cancer
progression, Chen et al. (1998) performed differential display PCR using
sublines of the nontumorigenic, prostate-specific antigen
(PSA)-secreting cell line LNCaP that differed in androgen sensitivity
and metastatic potential. They isolated 2 members of the GAGE family,
GAGEB1 (300288) and GAGE7. GAGE7 encodes a 117-amino acid polypeptide
that contains 3 potential casein kinase phosphorylation sites, 2
potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, and 1 potential
N-myristoylation site. Levels of GAGE7 mRNA were not correlated to the
degree of tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cell lines.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (2006) determined that GAGE7 is 1 of several copies of a
GAGE gene repeated on chromosome Xp11.23.

300597	TITLE *300597 G ANTIGEN 4; GAGE4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human melanoma cells express several distinct antigens that are
recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs). One class of
these antigens is encoded by genes, such as MAGE1 (MAGEA1; 300016),
MAGE3 (MAGEA3; 300174), and BAGE (605167), that are expressed in a large
fraction of tumors of various histologic types but are silent in normal
adult tissues, except for testis. Van den Eynde et al. (1995) identified
GAGE1 (300594) as a gene encoding an antigen that is present on melanoma
MZ2-MEL cells and is recognized by autologous CTLs. By screening a
melanoma MZ2-MEL cDNA library with a GAGE1 cDNA, they isolated cDNAs
representing 5 genes with sequence similarity to GAGE1. They named the
genes GAGE2 (GAGE2C; 300595), GAGE3 (300596), GAGE4, GAGE5 (300598), and
GAGE6 (300599). The GAGE2 to -6 cDNAs differ mainly by single nucleotide
substitutions that are scattered throughout the sequence. The deduced
GAGE4 protein has 117 amino acids. RT-PCR using primers common to GAGE1
to -6 found expression of these genes in various tumors but no
expression in any normal adult tissue tested except testis.

MAPPING

Chen et al. (2006) determined that GAGE4 is 1 of several copies of a
GAGE gene repeated on chromosome Xp11.23.

603368	TITLE *603368 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 6; CDK6
;;PLSTIRE
CDK6/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) regulate major cell cycle
transitions in eukaryotic cells. By RT-PCR of HeLa cell mRNA with
degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of CDC2 (116940),
Meyerson et al. (1992) identified cDNAs encoding 7 novel human protein
kinases. They designated 1 of these proteins PLSTIRE, following the
accepted practice of naming cdc2-related kinases based on the amino acid
sequence of the region corresponding to the conserved PSTAIRE motif of
CDC2. The predicted 326-amino acid PLSTIRE protein shares 47% and 71%
identity with CDC2 and PSK-J3 (CDK4; 123829). The in vitro
transcription/translation product has an apparent molecular weight of 40
kD by SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis revealed that the PLSTIRE gene
was expressed as 13-, 8.5-, and 6-kb mRNAs in several human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Meyerson and Harlow (1994) demonstrated that PLSTIRE is associated with
cyclins D1 (168461), D2 (123833), and D3 (123834) in lysates of human
cells and is activated by coexpression with D-type cyclins in Sf9 insect
cells. PLSTIRE immunoprecipitated from human cells exhibited significant
kinase activity, and was able to phosphorylate RB1 (614041). Based on
these findings, they renamed the protein CDK6 (cyclin-dependent kinase
6). In primary T cells that were stimulated to enter the cell cycle,
cellular CDK6 kinase activity first appeared in mid-G1, prior to the
activation of any previously characterized CDK. Meyerson and Harlow
(1994) suggested that CDK6, and the homologous CDK4, link growth factor
stimulation with the onset of cell cycle progression.

Guan et al. (1994) proposed that CDK4 and CDK6 are physiologic RB1
kinases that are inhibited by the p14 (600431), p16 (600160), and p18
(603369) CDK inhibitors. This inhibition prevents the phosphorylation of
RB1 and keeps RB1 in its active growth-suppressing state. See CDKN2D
(600927).

Harbour et al. (1999) presented evidence that phosphorylation of the
C-terminal region of RB by CDK4/CDK6 initiates successive intramolecular
interactions between the C-terminal region and the central pocket. The
initial interaction displaces histone deacetylase from the pocket,
blocking active transcriptional repression by RB. This facilitates a
second interaction that leads to phosphorylation of the pocket by CDK2
and disruption of pocket structure. These intramolecular interactions
provide a molecular basis for sequential phosphorylation of RB by
CDK4/CDK6 and CDK2. CDK4/CDK6 is activated early in G1, blocking active
repression by RB. However, it is not until near the end of G1, when
cyclin E (see 123837) is expressed and CDK2 is activated, that RB is
prevented from binding and inactivating E2F (189971).

Veiga-Fernandes and Rocha (2003) showed that, in contrast to naive CD8
(see 186910) T cells in G0/G1 arrest, memory CD8 T cells in G0/G1 arrest
have low expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1)
(CDKN1B; 600778) and high CDK6 activity. They found that preactivated
CDK6 is associated with cyclin D3 (CCND3) in the cytoplasm, facilitating
the switch to S phase and the rapid division of memory cells.
Veiga-Fernandes and Rocha (2003) concluded that naive T cells are in the
classic state of G0/G1 arrest with low amounts of D cyclins and CDK6 and
CDK2 (116953) activity but high levels of CDKN1B, whereas memory cells
have high levels of CCND3 and CDK6 activity in a distinct G0/G1 state.

Using microarray analysis, Lena et al. (2012) found that microRNA-191
(MIR191; 615150) was significantly upregulated in normal human neonatal
epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn) following development of senescence in
culture. Bioinformatic analysis and reporter gene assays revealed
functional MIR191 target sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of transcripts
for CDK6 and the AT-rich binding protein SATB1 (602075). Western blot
analysis confirmed that ectopic expression of MIR191 in HEKn cells
caused downregulation of SATB1 and CDK6, concomitant with decreased cell
proliferation and expression of senescence markers.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Bullrich et al. (1995)
mapped the CDK6 gene to 7p13-cen. However, radiation hybrid analysis and
inclusion within a mapped clone place the CDK6 gene at 7q21-q22 (TMAP
SGC34899).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Because of sequence and functional similarities between CDK4 (123829),
mutations in which cause familial melanoma (609048), and CDK6, Shennan
et al. (2000) hypothesized that germline mutations in CDK6 might
predispose to melanoma. They detected no CDK6 mutations, however, within
the p16-binding domain in index cases from 60 melanoma-prone kindreds
lacking germline mutations in the coding regions of either CDKN2A or
within the entire CDK4 coding region. They concluded that germline
mutations in CDK6 do not make a significant contribution to melanoma
predisposition.

For a discussion of an association between variation in the CDK6 gene
and stature, see STQTL11 (612223).

CYTOGENETICS

In an infant diagnosed at the age of 3 weeks with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL; 613065) after presenting with hepatosplenomegaly and
marked leukocytosis, Raffini et al. (2002) found a 3-way rearrangement
of the MLL (159555), AF4 (159557), and CDK6 genes. By reverse-panhandle
PCR, they identified a breakpoint junction of CDK6 from band 7q21-q22
and MLL intron 9. CDK6 is overexpressed or disrupted by translocation in
many cancers, e.g., T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (Chilosi et al.,
1998), T cell ALL, natural killer/T cell nasal lymphoma (Lien et al.,
2000), and glioblastoma multiforme (Costello et al., 1997). B cell
splenic lymphomas with villous lymphocytes are characterized by
t(2;7)(p12;q21) translocation juxtaposing CDK6 to the IGKC gene
(147200). The patient of Raffini et al. (2002) had an in-frame CDK6-MLL
transcript along with an in-frame MLL-AF4 transcript.

ANIMAL MODEL

Malumbres et al. (2004) found that Cdk6-null mice were viable and
developed normally, although hematopoiesis was slightly impaired.
Embryos defective for Cdk4 and Cdk6 died during the late stages of
embryonic development due to severe anemia. However, these embryos
displayed normal organogenesis, and most cell types proliferated
normally. In vitro, embryonic fibroblasts lacking Cdk4 and Cdk6
proliferated and became immortal upon serial passage. Quiescent
Cdk4/Cdk6-null cells responded to serum stimulation and entered S phase
with normal kinetics, although with lower efficiency. These results
indicated that D-type cyclin-dependent kinases are not essential for
cell cycle entry and suggested the existence of alternative mechanisms
to initiate cell proliferation upon mitogenic stimulation.

611150	TITLE *611150 ATAXIN 10; ATXN10
;;E46-LIKE; E46L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By positional cloning in the spinocerebellar ataxia-10 (SCA10; 603516)
candidate region on chromosome 22q13-qter, Matsuura et al. (2000)
identified a gene, ataxin-10 (ATXN10), encoding a deduced 475-amino acid
protein with 82% identity with a presumed mouse ortholog (E46).

By Northern blot analysis, Wakamiya et al. (2006) identified a 2-kb mRNA
ATXN10 transcript.

GENE STRUCTURE

Matsuura et al. (2000) presented a schematic representation of the
structure of the ATXN10 gene, which consists of 12 exons and spans 172.8
kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

The ATXN10 gene maps to chromosome 22q13 (Matsuura et al., 2000).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In all affected patients from 5 Mexican families with spinocerebellar
ataxia-10, Matsuura et al. (2000) found an expansion of a
pentanucleotide (ATTCT) repeat in intron 9 of the ATXN10 gene
(601150.0001).

In affected members of 4 Mexican families with SCA10, Rasmussen et al.
(2001) identified expanded ATTCT repeats ranging from 920 to 4,140
repeats.

Fang et al. (2002) reported a 19-year-old Hispanic woman from the U.S.
with SCA10 who was found to have a 280-repeat expansion. Her
asymptomatic mother had the same expansion. This was the smallest SCA10
expansion mutation identified to date. Alonso et al. (2006) reported a
Brazilian family in which the proband had a 400-repeat expansion in the
ATXN10 gene. She was a 59-year-old woman with gait ataxia since age 50
years. She also had mild limb ataxia, dysarthria, extensor plantar
responses, and moderate axonal peripheral neuropathy. Two unaffected
sibs and her unaffected father, aged 65, 56, and 90, had alleles of 370
and 360. In another Brazilian family, the affected son inherited an
allele of 750 repeats from his affected mother who had 760 repeats.
Alonso et al. (2006) noted that the first family lowered the threshold
of repeat numbers for pathogenesis down to 400. Combined with the report
of Fang et al. (2002), the findings suggested that there may be reduced
penetrance for SCA10 alleles of 280 to 370 repeats.

Wakamiya et al. (2006) detected normal sizes and amounts of ATXN10 mRNA
transcripts in multiple cell lines derived from patients with SCA10.
SCA10 cell lines showed that the expanded repeat did not interfere with
transcription or processing of the ATXN10 gene and also did not affect
the transcription of neighboring genes. Wakamiya et al. (2006) concluded
that a simple haploinsufficiency, gain-of-function, or neighboring gene
effect are unlikely mechanisms contributing to SCA10 and suggested that
a transdominant mechanism may be at work.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wakamiya et al. (2006) found that Atxn10-null mice died at early
postimplantation stage, whereas heterozygous mutants were overtly normal
and showed no motor abnormalities. Histologic examination of brain
tissue from heterozygous mice also showed no abnormalities.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA 10
ATXN10, (ATTCT)n EXPANSION

In all affected members of 5 Mexican families with SCA10 (603516),
Matsuura et al. (2000) detected expansion of a pentanucleotide (ATTCT)
repeat in intron 9 of the ATXN10 gene. There was an inverse correlation
between the expansion size, up to 22.5 kb larger than the normal allele,
and the age of onset. Analysis of 562 chromosomes from unaffected
individuals of various ethnic origins, including 242 chromosomes from
Mexicans, showed a range of 10 to 22 ATTCT repeats with no evidence of
expansions. The data indicated that the ATXN10 intronic ATTCT
pentanucleotide repeat in SCA10 patients is unstable and represented the
largest microsatellite expansion found to that time in the human genome.

In a multigenerational study, Matsuura et al. (2004) demonstrated that
(1) the expanded ATTCT repeats are highly unstable when paternally
transmitted, whereas maternal transmission results in significantly
smaller changes in repeat size; (2) blood leukocytes, lymphoblastoid
cells, buccal cells, and sperm have a variable degree of mosaicism in
ATTCT expansion; (3) the length of the expanded repeat was not observed
to change in individuals over a 5-year period; and (4) clinically
determined anticipation is sometimes associated with intergenerational
contraction rather than expansion of the ATTCT repeat.

611908	TITLE *611908 RFT1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; RFT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-glycosylation of proteins follows a highly conserved pathway that
begins with the synthesis of a Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-dolichylpyrophosphate
(PP-Dol) intermediate on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) membrane followed by the translocation of Man(5)GlcNAc
(2)-PP-Dol to the luminal side of the ER membrane. RFT1 is the flippase
enzyme that catalyzes this translocation (Helenius et al., 2002).

CLONING

By database searching with the sequence of S. cerevisiae Rft1 as query,
followed by RT-PCR of human fibroblast total RNA, Haeuptle et al. (2008)
cloned RFT1. The deduced 541-amino acid protein contains 11
transmembrane domains and has a potential N-glycosylation site in a
hydrophilic loop within the ER lumen. RFT1 shares 22% sequence identity
with the yeast protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Helenius et al. (2002) showed that the expression of yeast Rft1
complemented a defect in N-glycosylation in the delta-alg11 (613666)
strain of yeast. Overexpression of Rft1 in delta-alg11 yeast suggested
that Rft1 is the limiting component for the flipping of
Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol from the cytoplasmic to luminal side of the ER
membrane in vivo and that no additional factors are required. Rft1
depletion in yeast led to underglycosylation of the vacuolar N-linked
glycoprotein carboxypeptidase Y. Haeuptle et al. (2008) found human RFT1
complemented Rft1-depletion in yeast and restored normal
carboxypeptidase Y glycosylation.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the RFT1 gene to chromosome 3p21.1 based on an
alignment of the RFT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AJ318099) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

A particular feature of N-glycans is that they are first assembled in
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLO).
This assembly proceeds through the sequential addition of
monosaccharides to the growing LLO. The assembly of LLOs requires
glycosyltransferases and their respective nucleotide- and
dolicho-activated monosaccharide substrates, but it also requires
several proteins that regulate the complex topology of the process. For
example, in yeast the Rft1 protein is essential for translocation of the
cytosolically oriented intermediate DolPP-GlcNAc(2)Man(5) into the ER
lumen, where LLO assembly is completed. The identification of N-linked
glycosylation disorders in humans, referred to as congenital disorders
of glycosylation (see CDG1A, 212065), demonstrated the conservation of
the LLO assembly pathway between yeast and humans. Haeuptle et al.
(2008) identified a novel glycosylation defect in a theretofore untyped
CDG case (CDG1N; 612015), thereby establishing the importance of the
RFT1 protein in human N-linked glycosylation. The patient, who had been
diagnosed with a disorder of N-linked glycosylation on the basis of
detection of abnormal isoelectric focusing of serum transferrin, carried
a homozygous point mutation in the RFT1 gene (R67C; 611908.0001).

RFT1, ARG67CYS

In a patient with a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG1N;
612015), Haeuptle et al. (2008) identified a homozygous C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 199 of the RFT1 gene, resulting in a
substitution of cysteine for arginine at codon 67 (R67C). The R67C
substitution occurred in a 50-amino-acid hydrophilic stretch in the
overall hydrophobic RFT1 protein. Despite the low sequence identity
(22%) between yeast and human RFT1 protein, Haeuptle et al. (2008)
demonstrated both their functional orthology and the pathologic effect
of the human R67C mutation by complementation assay in Rft1-deficient
yeast cells. The causality of the RFT1 R67C mutation was further
established by restoration of normal glycosylation profiles in
patient-derived fibroblasts after lentiviral expression of the normal
RFT1 cDNA.

600753	TITLE *600753 GOLGI APPARATUS PROTEIN 1; GLG1
;;GOLGI SIALOGLYCOPROTEIN MG-160;;
E-SELECTIN LIGAND 1, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; ESL1
DESCRIPTION MG-160, originally isolated from rat brain, is a conserved membrane
sialoglycoprotein residing in the medial cisternae of the Golgi
apparatus of most cells (Gonatas et al., 1989). MG-160 appears early in
the developing chick embryo and persists in most cells throughout
embryonic development and in the adult animal (Mourelatos et al., 1995).
The early appearance and ubiquitous presence of MG-160 suggests that the
protein plays an important role in the biogenesis and function of the
Golgi apparatus. MG-160 binds basic fibroblast growth factor (FGFB;
134920) and displays 90% identity of amino acids with CFR, a
cysteine-rich receptor for several fibroblast growth factors that was
isolated from chick embryos. Unlike the fibroblast growth factor
receptors involved in signal transduction, MG-160 and its chick homolog,
CFR, do not display the extracellular Ig-like repeats and the
intracytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domains. In addition to CFR, MG-160 is
highly homologous to ESL-1, a ligand for E-selectin (SELE; 131210).

Mourelatos et al. (1996) isolated and characterized human GLG1 cDNAs.
The full-length cDNA encodes a predicted 1,179-amino acid protein that
has a signal peptide, a proline- and glutamine-rich region, a
cysteine-rich domain containing 5 potential asparagine-linked
glycosylation sites, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short
carboxy-terminal tail. The proline- and glutamine-rich segment contains
a polyglutamine stretch which is encoded by an uninterrupted exonic
sequence of CAG-CAA repeats. Human GLG1 shows between 88% and 95%
overall amino acid identity with rat Glg1, mouse Esl1, and chicken CRF.
The authors detected 3 transcripts of 10, 5, and 3.8 kb in several human
fetal and adult tissues by Northern blot analysis.

Mourelatos et al. (1995) localized the human GLG1 gene for MG-160 to
16q22-q23 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. If MG-160, as has been
postulated, mediates the secretion of fibroblast growth factors, the
chromosomal localization of the gene may facilitate understanding of the
role of the gene in human disease.

By Southern blot analysis of an interspecific backcross panel, Willmroth
and Beaudet (1999) mapped Esl1, the mouse homolog of the GLG1 gene, to
chromosome 8, in a region showing homology of synteny to human 16q. The
mouse gene contains 27 exons and extends over 75 kb.

607873	TITLE *607873 SCAVENGER RECEPTOR CLASS F, MEMBER 1; SCARF1
;;SCAVENGER RECEPTOR EXPRESSED BY ENDOTHELIAL CELLS; SREC;;
SREC1;;
SREC I;;
KIAA0149
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Scavenger receptors mediate the endocytosis of chemically modified
lipoproteins. SCARF1 specifically mediates the selective uptake of
acetylated low density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) into endothelial cells.

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a myeloid leukemia cell cDNA library,
Nagase et al. (1995) cloned SCARF1, which they designated KIAA0149. The
deduced 830-amino acid protein contains a putative transmembrane domain
and an EGF-like pattern of cysteine repeats. SCARF1 shares about 33%
identity over 147 amino acids with mouse Tie2 (600221), an epithelial
receptor tyrosine kinase. The 3-prime untranslated region contains an
Alu repeat. Northern blot analysis detected expression in most tissues
examined, with highest levels in lung and spleen. No expression was
detected in HeLa cells, pancreas, or colon.

Adachi et al. (1997) cloned SCARF1, which they designated SREC, using an
expression cloning strategy in which they assayed for uptake of
fluorescence-labeled Ac-LDL into CHO cells transfected with a human
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library. The deduced
830-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 86 kD.
SCARF1 contains a hydrophobic signal sequence followed by 5 EGF-like
cysteine pattern signatures in its extracellular N-terminal half, a
transmembrane region, and an intracellular C-terminal half containing a
serine/proline-rich region followed by a glycine-rich region. It has 3
potential N-glycosylation sites and several putative sites for serine
and threonine phosphorylation. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.5-kb
transcript expressed in HUVECs and in coronary artery endothelial cells,
but not in coronary artery smooth muscle cells.

Adachi and Tsujimoto (2002) identified several SCARF1 variants in a
peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library. Alternative splicing introduces
a stop codon before the transmembrane region in 2 of the variants,
resulting in soluble forms of SCARF1.

GENE FUNCTION

Adachi et al. (1997) determined that CHO cells stably expressing SCARF1
bound radiolabeled Ac-LDL with high affinity and degraded it via an
endocytic pathway. The association between SCARF1 and Ac-LDL was
inhibited by oxidized LDL, malondialdehyde-modified LDL, dextran
sulfate, and polyinosinic acid, but not by natural LDL or heparin.

Adachi and Tsujimoto (2002) determined that all membrane-bound splice
variants of SCARF1 showed receptor activity toward Ac-LDL. They
identified a transcriptional activator of SCARF1, ZNF444 (607874).
Overexpression of ZNF444 in HUVECs increased SCARF1 promoter activity
nearly 2.5-fold. An intact SP1 (189906) motif and an intact inverted
repeat sequence with a triple-nucleotide spacer (IR3), which binds
ZNF444, were required for maximal SCARF1 expression. Several
inflammatory cytokines inhibited SCARF1 promoter activity in vitro and
decreased Ac-LDL uptake in vivo.

Means et al. (2009) showed that the scavenger receptors Scarf1 and Cd36
(173510) mediated mouse defense against 2 fungal pathogens, Cryptococcus
neoformans and Candida albicans, by enabling production of antimicrobial
peptides. Studies in C. elegans indicated that the homologous proteins
protected nematodes. Macrophage binding and cytokine production required
Cd36, but not Tlr2 (603028), and binding was dependent on recognition of
pathogen beta-glucans. Mice lacking Cd36, but expressing other
beta-glucan receptors (e.g., CLEC7A; 606264), had a higher fungal burden
and greater mortality after intravenous infection with C. neoformans
compared with wildtype mice. Means et al. (2009) concluded that SCARF1
and CD36 are beta-glucan-binding receptors and are involved in an
evolutionarily conserved pathway for the innate sensing of fungal
pathogens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Adachi and Tsujimoto (2002) determined that the SCARF1 gene contains 11
exons and spans 12 kb. The 5-prime flanking region lacks TATA and CCAAT
boxes, but it contains several putative motifs for DNA-binding elements,
including an SP1 motif and an IR3 sequence that binds ZNF444.

MAPPING

By PCR of a human/rodent hybrid panel, Nagase et al. (1995) mapped the
SCARF1 gene to chromosome 17.

;;DELTA SLEEP-INDUCING PEPTIDE, IMMUNOREACTOR; DSIPI;;
GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED LEUCINE ZIPPER; GILZ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Drosophila 'shortsighted' (shs) protein, which is necessary for
photoreceptor differentiation, is a homolog of the mouse
TGF-beta-1-inducible protein Tsc22 (607715). Both of these proteins, as
well as the porcine protein DIP (DSIP-immunoreactive peptide), are
leucine zipper proteins that lack an N-terminal basic DNA-binding
region. Vogel et al. (1996) screened a human fetal brain cDNA library
with a porcine DIP cDNA fragment and isolated a 420-bp cDNA that encodes
a predicted 122-amino acid protein. The putative DSIPI protein exhibits
high identity with porcine DIP, differing in just 4 positions. Sequence
comparisons revealed a highly conserved leucine zipper region in DSIPI,
Tsc22, and shs. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated widespread distribution of
the DSIPI protein among various human tissues.

Using mouse Gilz to screen a human T-lymphocyte cDNA library, Cannarile
et al. (2001) cloned full-length GILZ. The deduced 135-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 15 kD. GILZ contains a
leucine zipper, a C-terminal proline-rich and acidic region, an
N-glycosylation site, and several sites for threonine and serine
phosphorylation. Northern blot analysis detected highest GILZ expression
in brain, lung, spleen, skeletal muscle, and in all hematopoietic cell
lineages examined. Lower expression was found in heart and kidney, and
no expression was found in liver and pancreas. Western blot analysis
found complete concordance between mRNA and protein expression,
suggesting that GILZ expression is regulated at the transcriptional
level.

GENE FUNCTION

Cannarile et al. (2001) found that expression of GILZ increased in human
peripheral blood leukocytes, monocytes, and CD3 (see 186740)-positive
cells following dexamethasone treatment.

Berrebi et al. (2003) found that mouse and human macrophages produced
GILZ in noninflamed tissues, and production by macrophages was
stimulated by glucocorticoids and by IL10 (124092), both in vitro and in
vivo. In addition, GILZ inhibited the expression of Toll-like receptors
(TLRs; see 601194) and molecules involved in antigen presentation and
inflammation. GILZ expression was downregulated in macrophages from
inflammatory lesions of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, whereas
it persisted in tumor-infiltrating macrophages from Burkitt lymphomas
(113970).

GILZ appears to modulate the response of T lymphocytes to stimulation of
the T-cell receptor (TCR). Overexpression of GILZ in a murine lymphoid
cell line inhibited anti-CD3-induced apoptosis via downregulation of FAS
(134637)/FASL (134638) expression and also significantly affected
interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) production and expression of IL2 receptor
(IL2R; 147730) (Ayroldi et al., 2001). GILZ may exert its effects by
interfering at various stages of the signaling pathways that are
triggered by TCR stimulation. Interleukin-2 withdrawal is a physiologic
process inducing cell death in activated T lymphocytes. Asselin-Labat et
al. (2004) reported that IL2 deprivation leads to expression of GILZ in
T lymphocytes. They characterized the GILZ promoter and showed that
forkhead box class O3 (FOXO3; 602681) binding to the foxhead responsive
elements identified in the promoter is necessary for induction of GILZ
expression when IL2 is withdrawn. GILZ overexpression protected CTLL2
cells from IL2 withdrawal-induced apoptosis, whereas cell death was
accelerated in cells unable to express GILZ. These and other experiments
indicated that GILZ is a transiently expressed protein induced upon IL2
withdrawal that protects T cells from the onset of apoptosis.

Ayroldi et al. (2007) demonstrated that Gilz interacted directly with
Ras (HRAS; 190020) in vitro and in vivo as shown by Gilz and Ras
coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization upon phorbol ester activation
in primary mouse spleen T lymphocytes and thymus cells. Analysis of Gilz
mutants showed that they bound Ras through the TSC box, and depending on
the Ras activation levels, formed a trimeric complex with Ras and Raf
(RAF1; 164760). As a consequence of these interactions, Gilz diminished
activation of Ras and Raf downstream targets, leading to inhibition of
Ras- and Raf-dependent cell proliferation and Ras-induced mouse
fibroblast transformation. Gilz silencing resulted in an increase in
concanavalin A-induced T cell proliferation and inhibition of
dexamethasone antiproliferative effects. Ayroldi et al. (2007) concluded
that GILZ is a negative regulator of RAS- and RAF-induced proliferation
and is a mediator of the antiproliferative effects of glucocorticoids.

MAPPING

By FISH, Cannarile et al. (2001) mapped the DSIPI gene to chromosome
Xq22.2.

604064	TITLE *604064 ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 4; ATF4
;;CYCLIC AMP RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 2; CREB2;;
TAX-RESPONSIVE ENHANCER ELEMENT B67; TAXREB67
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATF4 belongs to the large ATF/CREB family of transcription factors.
These proteins bind DNA via their basic region and dimerize via their
leucine zipper domain to form a variety of homo- and heterodimers to
regulate gene transcription (De Angelis et al., 2003).

CLONING

An activating transcription factor (ATF)-binding site is a promoter
element present in a wide variety of viral and cellular genes, including
E1A-inducible adenoviral genes and cAMP-inducible cellular genes. Hai et
al. (1989) identified cDNAs encoding 8 different human ATF
consensus-binding proteins, including a partial cDNA corresponding to
ATF4. They found that members of this family share significant sequence
similarity within a leucine zipper DNA-binding motif and an adjacent
basic region; the proteins show little similarity outside of these
regions.

The cAMP response element (CRE) is an octanucleotide motif that mediates
diverse transcriptional regulatory effects. By screening a Jurkat T-cell
line expression library for the ability to bind CRE, Karpinski et al.
(1992) isolated a full-length cDNA corresponding to ATF4, which they
called CREB2 (CRE-binding protein-2). The predicted protein contains 351
amino acids. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 1.5-kb CREB2 mRNA
was expressed in all human tumor cell lines and mouse organs tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Karpinski et al. (1992) found that, unlike CREB (123810), which
activates transcription from CRE-containing promoters, CREB2 functions
as a specific repressor of CRE-dependent transcription. The
transcriptional repressor activity resides within the C-terminal leucine
zipper and basic domain region of the CREB2 protein.

The p40tax gene product of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)
activates HTLV-1 viral transcription in trans through tax-responsive
enhancers in the long terminal repeats. Tsujimoto et al. (1991)
identified ATF4 as TAXREB67, a protein that binds to the tax-responsive
enhancer element in HTLV-1.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, He et al. (2001) found that mouse Nrf2
(NFE2L2; 600492) interacted with rat Atf4. Coimmunoprecipitation and
mammalian 2-hybrid analyses confirmed the interaction. An Nrf2-Atf4
dimer bound a stress response element (StRE) sequence from an Nrf2
target gene, Ho1 (HMOX1; 141250). CdCl2, an Ho1 inducer, increased
expression of Atf4 in mouse hepatoma cells prior to induction of Ho1. A
dominant-negative Atf4 mutant inhibited basal and CdCl2-induced
expression of an StRE-dependent construct in hepatoma cells, but it only
inhibited basal expression in a human mammary epithelial cell line. He
et al. (2001) concluded that ATF4 regulates HO1 expression in a
cell-specific manner, possibly in a complex with NRF2.

Siu et al. (2002) presented evidence that ATF4 binds nutrient-sensing
response element-1 (NSRE1) in the human asparagine synthetase (ASNS;
108370) gene and activates ASNS transcription in response to nutrient
stress.

Bagheri-Yarmand et al. (2003) found that expression of Atf4 was high in
virgin mouse mammary glands and in pregnant mammary glands, but it was
dramatically reduced during lactation and higher after weaning.
Transgenic mice overexpressing Atf4 in mammary epithelium showed
decreased proliferation and impaired differentiation of alveolar
epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation. In addition, Atf4
overexpression induced apoptosis and accelerated involution of the
mammary gland, suggesting a role for ATF4 in the regulation of normal
mammary gland involution.

De Angelis et al. (2003) showed that human ATF4 and RBP3 (E2F1; 189971)
dimerized in vitro and in vivo and that RBP3 enhanced ATF4
transactivating activity. Expression of both proteins increased during
differentiation of a mouse myogenic cell line.

ATF4 has 2 upstream ORFs (uORFs) that are conserved in vertebrates. The
more 3-prime uORF, uORF2, extends into the coding region of full-length
ATF4. Independently, Lu et al. (2004) and Vattem and Wek (2004) found
that scanning ribosomes initiated translation at both uORFs of mouse
Atf4, and that ribosomes that translated uORF1 efficiently reinitiated
translation at downstream AUGs. In unstressed mouse fibroblasts, low
levels of phosphorylated Eif2 (see EIF2S1; 603907) favored early
capacitation of reinitiating ribosomes, directing them to the inhibitory
uORF2 downstream of uORF1, which precluded translation of Atf4 and
repressed the integrated stress response. In stressed cells, high levels
of phosphorylated Eif2 delayed capacitation of reinitiating ribosomes,
favoring reinitiation at the Atf4 coding sequence over uORF2, which
permitted Atf4 expression and activated the integrated stress response.

Using Rsk2 (300075) -/- mice, Yang et al. (2004) showed that RSK2 is
required for osteoblast differentiation and function. They identified
the transcription factor ATF4 as a critical substrate of RSK2 that is
required for the timely onset of osteoblast differentiation, for
terminal differentiation of osteoblasts, and for osteoblast-specific
gene expression. Additionally, RSK2 and ATF4 were found to
posttranscriptionally regulate the synthesis of type I collagen (see
120150), the main constituent of the bone matrix. Accordingly, Atf4
deficiency in mice resulted in delayed bone formation during embryonic
development and low bone mass throughout postnatal life. Yang et al.
(2004) concluded that ATF4 is a critical regulator of osteoblast
differentiation and function and that lack of ATF4 phosphorylation by
RSK2 may contribute to the skeletal phenotype of Coffin-Lowry syndrome
(303600).

Blais et al. (2004) determined that EIF2-alpha (EIF2S1), PERK (EIF2AK3;
604032), ATF4, and GADD34 (PPP1R15A; 611048) are involved in an
integrated adaptive response to hypoxic stress in HeLa cells.

Sayer et al. (2006) performed a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human fetal
brain expression library and identified ATF4 as a direct interaction
partner of CEP290 (NPHP6; 610142). The protein-interaction domains
mapped to the N-terminal third of CEP290, encoded by exons 2 through 21,
and the C-terminal two-thirds of ATF4. To confirm that CEP290 and ATF4
interact physiologically in vivo, Sayer et al. (2006) performed
coimmunoprecipitation experiments using bovine retina extracts.
Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that endogenous ATF4 can be
immunoprecipitated using an antibody to CEP290 but not using a control
IgG. Reverse coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that antibody to
ATF4 can also precipitate endogenous CEP290.

Lin et al. (2010) showed that although Skp2 (601436) inactivation on its
own does not induce cellular senescence, aberrant protooncogenic signals
as well as inactivation of tumor suppressor genes do trigger a potent,
tumor-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2.
Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic stress-driven senescence
neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf) (see 600160)-p53 (191170)
pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Aft4, p27 (600778), and
p21 (116899). Lin et al. (2010) further demonstrated that genetic Skp2
inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in
which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex
inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten (601728)-deficient
cells and tumor regression in preclinical studies. Lin et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings provided proof-of-principle evidence that
pharmacologic inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for
cancer prevention and therapy.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ATF4
gene to chromosome 22 (TMAP stSG29796).

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (1998) used gene targeting to generate mice lacking Atf4.
They found that Atf4-deficient mice exhibited severe microphthalmia. The
Atf4-deficient eyes revealed a normal gross lens structure up to
embryonic day 14.5, after which the lens degenerated due to apoptosis
without the formation of lens secondary fiber cells. Retinal development
was normal in the mutant mice. The lens-specific expression of Atf4 in
the mutant mice led not only to the recovery of lens secondary fibers
but also to the induction of hyperplasia of these fibers. Tanaka et al.
(1998) concluded that ATF4 is essential for the later stages of lens
fiber cell differentiation.

NOMENCLATURE

The ATF4 gene, which Karpinski et al. (1992) referred to as CREB2,
should not be confused with the ATF2 gene (123811), which was formerly
known as CREB2.

610292	TITLE *610292 B-CELL SCAFFOLD PROTEIN WITH ANKYRIN REPEATS 1; BANK1
;;FLJ20706;;
BANK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BANK1 is a B-cell-specific scaffold protein and LYN (165120) tyrosine
kinase substrate that promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (see ITPR1; 147265) (Yokoyama et al.,
2002).

CLONING

By solid-phase phosphorylation screening, followed by database analysis
and PCR of RNA isolated from Daudi B cells, Yokoyama et al. (2002)
cloned BANK1, which they called BANK. The deduced 755-amino acid protein
has a calculated molecular mass of 85.5 kD. BANK1 shares amino acid
homology with mouse Bcap (PIK3AP1; 607942) especially over the ankyrin
repeat motifs and predicted coiled-coil regions. BANK1 contains 23
tyrosine residues that may be phosphorylated including several potential
SH2 domain binding sites. By Northern blot analysis, a 3.2-kb transcript
was detected in mouse spleen and human Daudi B cell line, but not in T
cells or myeloid cells. By RT-PCR analysis of various B and T lineage
cells, Yokoyama et al. (2002) showed that BANK1 expression was confined
to functional B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-expressing B cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation analysis and spectrophotometry, Yokoyama et al.
(2002) showed that BANK1 underwent receptor-dependent tyrosine
phosphorylation and that BANK1 activation enhanced BCR-induced calcium
mobilization from intracellular calcium stores. By coimmunoprecipitation
analysis of BANK1 and LYN mutants, Yokoyama et al. (2002) demonstrated
that BANK1 residues 367-653 were required for association with LYN and
tyrosine phosphorylation of BANK1. BANK1 amino acids 1-367 interacted
with ITPR2 (600144). By interaction and phosphorylation analyses of
coexpression of BANK1, LYN, and ITPR2 and various mutants, Yokoyama et
al. (2002) concluded that BANK1 promotes LYN-mediated tyrosine
phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors.

MAPPING

By database sequence analysis, Yokoyama et al. (2002) mapped the BANK1
gene to chromosome 4q22-q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 152700) is a prototypic autoimmune
disease characterized by production of autoantibodies and complex
genetic inheritance. In a genomewide association scan of SLE using
85,042 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Kozyrev et al. (2008)
identified an association between SLE and a nonsynonymous substitution,
dbSNP rs10516487 (R61H; 610292.0001) in the BANK1 gene. They replicated
the association for independent case-control sets. In an analysis of
BANK1 cDNA, they found 2 isoforms, 1 full-length and the other
alternatively spliced and lacking exon 2, encoding a protein without a
putative domain for binding of IP3R (147265). The transcripts were
differentially expressed depending on a branch point-site SNP, dbSNP
rs17266594, in strong linkage disequilibrium with dbSNP rs10516487. A
third associated variant was found in the ankyrin domain (dbSNP
rs3733197). These findings implicated BANK1 as a susceptibility gene for
SLE, with variants affecting regulatory sites and key functional
domains. The disease-associated variants could contribute to sustained B
cell receptor signaling and B cell hyperactivity characteristic of SLE.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using flow cytometry, Aiba et al. (2006) showed that Bank was expressed
in most mouse B-cell subpopulations, but that Bank expression was
decreased in germinal center (GC) B cells. Aiba et al. (2006) generated
Bank-deficient mice and found that Bank was dispensable for most aspects
of B-cell development. However, Bank-deficient mice had higher levels of
mature B cells and spontaneous GC B cells, particularly in response to
T-dependent antigens, as well as higher serum IgG2a. Bank-deficient B
cells had an enhanced proliferative response to Cd40 (109535). Augmented
GC formation and IgM secretion in response to T-dependent antigen
immunization were abolished in mice lacking both Cd40 and Bank. Western
blot analysis revealed enhanced Cd40-mediated Akt (164730) activation in
Bank-deficient B cells. Aiba et al. (2006) concluded that BANK modulates
hyperactive B-cell responses by inhibiting AKT activation in
CD40-mediated pathways.

606829	TITLE *606829 FRATAXIN; FXN
;;FRDA GENE;;
X25
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial iron chaperone involved in
iron-sulfur biogenesis and heme biosynthesis. Some studies have also
suggested that frataxin functions as an iron storage molecule, an
antioxidant, and a tumor suppressor (summary by Schmucker et al.
(2008)).

CLONING

By searching the candidate region defined by analysis of recombination
events in families with Friedreich ataxia (229300), Montermini et al.
(1995) reported that they had located a 150-kb region in chromosome 9q13
that represented the FRDA locus. Campuzano et al. (1996) identified
potential exons in the region in chromosome 9q13 using cDNA selection
and sequence analysis. The FXN gene was isolated by this method and
called X25 by the authors. It encodes a 210-amino acid protein, termed
frataxin. It was shown to be expressed in a range of tissues, most
abundantly in heart. High levels of expression were also found in the
spinal cord; lower levels were detected in the cerebellum, and no
expression was demonstrated in the cerebral cortex.

Koutnikova et al. (1997) cloned the complete coding region of mouse
frataxin and studied its pattern of expression in developing and adult
tissues. Frataxin mRNA was predominantly expressed in tissues with a
high metabolic rate, including liver, kidney, brown fat, and heart. They
showed that mouse and yeast frataxin homologs contain a potential
mitochondrial targeting sequence in their N-terminal domains and that
disruption of the yeast gene results in mitochondrial dysfunction.

GENE STRUCTURE

Campuzano et al. (1996) found that the FXN gene contains 6 exons.

Baralle et al. (2008) stated that the FXN gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 80 kb. The GAA repeat, which when expanded is associated
with disease, is located in the middle of an Alu sequence in the
approximately 11-kb first intron.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Campuzano et al. (1996) mapped the FXN gene to
chromosome 9q13.

GENE FUNCTION

To study frataxin function, Campuzano et al. (1997) developed monoclonal
antibodies raised against different regions of the frataxin protein.
These antibodies detected a processed 18-kD protein in various human and
mouse tissues and cell lines that is severely reduced in Friedreich
ataxia patients. By immunocytofluorescence and immunocytoelectron
microscopy, Campuzano et al. (1997) demonstrated that frataxin is
located in mitochondria, associated with the mitochondrial membranes and
crests. Analysis of cellular localization of various truncated forms of
frataxin expressed in cultured cells and evidence of removal of an
N-terminal epitope during protein maturation demonstrated that the
mitochondrial targeting sequence is encoded by the first 20 amino acids.
Given the shared clinical features between Friedreich ataxia, vitamin E
deficiency, and some mitochondriopathies, Campuzano et al. (1997)
suggested that their data indicate that a reduction in frataxin results
in oxidative damage.

Using the yeast 2-hybrid assay (Fields and Song, 1989), Koutnikova et
al. (1998) identified mitochondrial processing peptidase-beta (MPPB;
603131) as a frataxin protein partner. In in vitro assays, MPPB bound
frataxin which is cleaved by the reconstituted MPP heterodimer. MPP
cleavage of frataxin results in an intermediate form (amino acids 41 to
210) that is processed further to the mature form. In vitro and in vivo
experiments suggested that 2 C-terminal missense mutations found in FRDA
patients, I151F (606829.0004) and G127V (606829.0005), modulate
interaction with MPP-beta, resulting in a slower maturation process at
the normal cleavage site. The slower processing rate of frataxin
carrying such missense mutations may therefore contribute to frataxin
deficiency, in addition to an impairment of its function. Similar
studies were reported by Gordon et al. (1999), with conflicting results.
They performed in vitro experiments with MPP, wildtype and I154F human
frataxin or its mutant yeast homolog, and purified mammalian or yeast
mitochondria. These authors concluded that MPP was capable of 1-step
processing of frataxin to the mature form, and that the I154F mutation
had no effect on mitochondrial import and/or maturation of frataxin.

Schmucker et al. (2008) found that the 210-amino acid FXN precursor
could be processed into several forms in vitro depending upon the assay
conditions. They determined that the physiologically relevant mature
peptide corresponds to amino acids 81 through 210, which is generated by
MPPB in 2 cleavage steps.

Ristow et al. (2000) demonstrated that overexpression of frataxin in
mammalian cells causes a Ca(2+)-induced upregulation of tricarboxylic
acid cycle flux and respiration, which, in turn, leads to an increased
mitochondrial membrane potential and results in an elevated cellular ATP
content. Thus, frataxin appears to be a key activator of mitochondrial
energy conversion and oxidative phosphorylation.

Santos et al. (2001) examined the role of frataxin in neuronal
differentiation by transfecting the P19 embryonic carcinoma cell line
with antisense or sense frataxin constructs. During retinoic
acid-induced neurogenesis of frataxin-deficient cells there was a
striking rise in cell death, while cell division remained unaffected.
However, frataxin deficiency did not affect cell survival in cells
induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Frataxin deficiency
enhanced apoptosis of retinoic acid-stimulated cells, and the number of
neuronal-like cells expressing MAP2 (157130) was dramatically reduced in
these clones. In addition, antisense clones induced to differentiate
into neuroectoderm with retinoic acid had increased production of
reactive oxygen species, and only cells noncommitted to the neuronal
lineages could be rescued by the addition of the antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine (NAC). However, NAC treatment had no effect in
increasing the number of terminally differentiated neuronal-like cells
in frataxin-deficient clones. The authors suggested that frataxin
deficiency may render cells susceptible to apoptosis after exposure to
appropriate stimuli.

Adinolfi et al. (2002) compared the properties of 3 proteins from the
frataxin family (bacterial CyaY from Escherichia coli, yeast Yfh1, and
human frataxin) as representative of organisms of increasing complexity.
The 3 proteins have the same fold but different thermal stabilities and
iron-binding properties. While human frataxin has no tendency to bind
iron, CyaY forms iron-promoted aggregates with a behavior similar to
that of yeast frataxin. Mutants produced to identify the protein surface
involved in iron-promoted aggregation demonstrated that the process is
mediated by a negatively charged surface ridge. Mutation of 3 of these
residues was sufficient to convert CyaY into a protein with properties
similar to those of human frataxin. On the other hand, mutation of the
exposed surface of the beta sheet, which contains most of the conserved
residues, did not affect aggregation, suggesting to the authors that
iron binding is a nonconserved part of a more complex cellular function
of frataxins.

Cavadini et al. (2002) showed that the mature form of human frataxin,
when expressed in E. coli, assembles into a stable homopolymer that can
bind approximately 10 atoms of iron per molecule of frataxin. As
analyzed by gel filtration and electron microscopy, the homopolymer
consists of globular particles of approximately 1 megadalton and orders
rod-shaped polymers of these particles that accumulate small
electron-dense cores. When the human frataxin precursor was expressed in
S. cerevisiae, the mitochondrially-generated mature form was separated
by gel filtration into monomer and a high molecular weight pool of
approximately 600 kD, which was also present in mouse heart. In
radiolabeled yeast cells, human frataxin was recovered by
immunoprecipitation with approximately 5 atoms of iron bound per
molecule. The authors suggested that FRDA may result from decreased
mitochondrial iron storage due to frataxin deficiency, which may impair
iron metabolism, promote oxidative damage, and lead to progressive iron
accumulation.

Shoichet et al. (2002) demonstrated that transgenic overexpression of
human frataxin in murine 3T3-L1 cells increased cellular antioxidant
defense. Subsequent activation of glutathione peroxidase and elevation
of reduced thiols reduced the incidence of malignant transformation
induced by reactive oxygen species, as observed by tumor formation in
nude mice. The authors tentatively suggested a role for frataxin
mutations in the early induction of cancer.

Tan et al. (2003) analyzed gene expression in 3 human cell types using
microarrays and identified 48 transcripts whose expression was
significantly frataxin-dependent in at least 2 cell types. Significant
decreases in 7 transcripts occurred in the sulfur amino acid (SAA)
biosynthetic pathway and the iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biosynthetic
pathway to which it is connected. Expression of ISC-S and rhodanese
(TST; 180370) transcripts was lower in mutants. Homocystine, cysteine,
cystathionine, and serine were significantly decreased in
frataxin-deficient cell extracts and mitochondria. Succinate
dehydrogenase and aconitase, whose activities require ISCs, were less
active. The ISC-U scaffold protein was specifically decreased in
frataxin-deficient cells, and sodium sulfide partially rescued the
oxidant sensitivity of the FRDA cells. Multiple transcripts involved in
the Fas (134637)/TNF (191160)/INF apoptosis pathway were upregulated in
frataxin-deficient cells, consistent with a multistep mechanism of
Friedreich ataxia pathophysiology and suggesting alternative
possibilities for therapeutic intervention.

By RNA interference (RNAi) of frataxin in HeLa cells, Stehling et al.
(2004) found that the enzyme activity of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins
aconitase (ACO1/IRP1; 100880) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA; 600857)
was decreased, while the activity of non-Fe/S proteins remained
constant. Fe/S cluster association with cytosolic IRP1 was diminished.
In contrast, no alterations in cellular iron uptake, iron content, and
heme formation were found, and no mitochondrial iron deposits were
observed upon frataxin depletion. Iron accumulation in FRDA mitochondria
appeared to be a late consequence of frataxin deficiency. Stehling et
al. (2004) concluded that frataxin is a component of the human Fe/S
cluster assembly machinery and that it plays a role in the maturation of
both mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S proteins.

Bulteau et al. (2004) found that aconitase (100850) activity can undergo
reversible citrate-dependent modulation in response to prooxidants.
Frataxin interacted with aconitase in a citrate-dependent fashion,
reduced the level of oxidant-induced inactivation, and converted the
inactive [3Fe-4S]1+ enzyme to the active [4Fe-4S]2+ form of the protein.
Bulteau et al. (2004) concluded that frataxin is an iron chaperone
protein that protects the aconitase [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster from disassembly
and promotes enzyme reactivation.

To further discern the role of oxidative stress in FRDA pathophysiology,
Seznec et al. (2005) tested the potential effect of increased
antioxidant defense using an MnSOD mimetic (SOD2; 147460) and Cu-Zn SOD
(SOD1; 147450) overexpression on murine FRDA cardiomyopathy. No positive
effect was observed, suggesting that increased superoxide production
could not solely explain the cardiac pathophysiology associated with
FRDA. Complete frataxin deficiency neither induced oxidative stress in
neuronal tissues nor altered MnSOD expression and induction in early
stages of neuronal and cardiac pathology. Cytosolic ISC aconitase
activity of IRP1 progressively decreased, whereas its apo-RNA binding
form increased despite the absence of oxidative stress, suggesting that
in a mammalian system the mitochondrial ISC assembly machinery is
essential for cytosolic ISC biogenesis. Seznec et al. (2005) concluded
that in FRDA, mitochondrial iron accumulation does not induce oxidative
stress, and FRDA is not associated with oxidative damage.

By immunoprecipitation analysis of mitochondria from human lymphoblasts
and transfected COS-7 cells, Shan et al. (2007) showed that FXN
interacted directly with several mitochondrial proteins, including the
iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis complex component ISD11 (LYRM4; 613311),
the mitochondrial chaperones HSPA9 (600548) and HSP60 (HSPD1; 118190),
the ATP synthase subunit ATP5L, the ATPase ATAD3A (612316), succinate
dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA; 600857), AFG3L2 (604581), and FXN itself.
Reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interactions of
FXN with ISD11 and HSPA9 in transfected HEK293 cells. The interaction
between FXN and ISD11 was reversed by EDTA and by several cations at
physiologic concentration, including Fe(3+). However, Ni(2+)
strengthened the interaction between FXN and ISD11. RT-PCR analysis of
lymphoblasts from Friedreich ataxia patients revealed that reduced FXN
mRNA was associated with reduced ISD11 mRNA. Shan et al. (2007) proposed
that FXN deficiency causes transcriptional corepression of genes
involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis.

Using hybrid reporter minigenes with 100 GAA or TTC repeats transfected
into COS or HeLa cells, Baralle et al. (2008) found that both repeats
were efficiently transcribed and inserted into nascent pre-mRNAs that
bound multiple splicing factors. However, the GAA repeats, but not TTC
repeats, caused aberrant splicing of the pre-mRNA. The type of aberrant
splicing depended on the position used for insertion of the GAA repeat,
and the length of the repeat affected the severity of the splicing
abnormality. GAA repeats inserted in a frataxin minigene reduced
splicing efficiency without affecting the abundance of the nascent
transcript. The pathologic expansion induced a block in the processing
of 1 splicing intermediate that accumulated in the nucleus. Baralle et
al. (2008) proposed that the block caused by GAA expansion results from
interference from multiple splicing factors bound to the nascent GAA
repeat-containing transcript, resulting in degradation of the pre-RNA
and lower abundance of mature frataxin mRNA.

To address the physiologic function of human extramitochondrial
frataxin, Condo et al. (2010) searched for ISC-dependent interaction
partners. The authors demonstrated that the extramitochondrial form of
frataxin directly interacted with cytosolic aconitase/iron regulatory
protein-1 (ACO1/IRP1; 100880), a bifunctional protein alternating
between an enzymatic and an RNA-binding function through the
'iron-sulfur switch' mechanism. The cytosolic aconitase defect and
consequent IRP1 activation occurring in FRDA cells were reversed by the
action of extramitochondrial frataxin.

- Studies Using the Yeast Frataxin Homolog

Babcock et al. (1997) characterized a gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
whose predicted gene product had high sequence similarity to the human
frataxin protein. The yeast gene (yeast frataxin homolog, YFH1) encodes
a mitochondrial protein involved in iron homeostasis and respiratory
function. Human frataxin also was shown to be a mitochondrial protein.

Wilson and Roof (1997) showed that YFH1 localizes to mitochondria and is
required to maintain mitochondrial DNA. They showed that the
YFH1-homologous domain of frataxin functions in yeast and that a
disease-associated missense mutation of this domain, or the
corresponding domain in YFH1, reduces function.

Adamec et al. (2000) expressed a mature form of the YFH1 protein in E.
coli and analyzed its function in vitro. The isolated protein is a
soluble monomer that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency
to self-associate. Aerobic addition of ferrous iron to the protein
resulted in assembly of regular spherical multimers. Each multimer
consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester more than 3,000
atoms of iron. Titration of the yeast protein with increasing iron
concentrations supported a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly.
Sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent resulted in
quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer,
indicating that the yeast frataxin protein sequesters iron in an
available form. Adamec et al. (2000) proposed that iron-dependent
self-assembly of recombinant yeast frataxin protein reflects a
physiologic role for frataxin in mitochondrial iron sequestration and
bioavailability.

Cavadini et al. (2000) showed that wildtype FRDA cDNA can complement the
YFH1 protein-deficient yeast (YFH1-delta) by preventing the
mitochondrial iron accumulation and oxidative damage associated with
loss of YFH1. The G130V mutation (606829.0005) affected protein
stability and resulted in low levels of mature frataxin, which were
nevertheless sufficient to rescue YFH1-delta yeast. The W173G
(606829.0007) mutation affected protein processing and stability and
resulted in severe mature frataxin deficiency. Expression of the FRDA
W173G cDNA in YFH1-delta yeast led to increased levels of mitochondrial
iron which were not as elevated as in YFH1-deficient cells but were
above the threshold for oxidative damage of mitochondrial DNA and
iron-sulfur centers, causing a typical YFH1-delta phenotype. The authors
concluded that frataxin functions like YFH1 protein, providing
additional experimental support for the hypothesis that FRDA is a
disorder of mitochondrial iron homeostasis.

Gordon et al. (2001) mapped the 2 cleavage sites of the YFH1 protein
precursor. Mutations blocking the first or the second cleavage of YFH1
protein did not interfere with its import from the cytoplasm or with its
ability to complement phenotypes of the YFH1-delta mutant yeast strain.
The first cleaved domain (domain I), consisting of 20 N-terminal amino
acids, was able to import a nonmitochondrial passenger fusion protein.
However, neither domain I nor other matrix-targeting signals alone could
support efficient import of mature YFH1 protein. The second cleaved
domain (domain II), consisting of an additional 31 N-terminal amino
acids, was required as a spacer between a targeting signal and mature
YFH1 protein. Likewise, when YFH1 protein constructs lacking domain I or
II were expressed in vivo, they failed to attain appreciable
steady-state amounts in mitochondria and could not complement phenotypes
of the YFH1-delta mutant.

Karthikeyan et al. (2002) found that the absence of frataxin in yeast
leads to nuclear damage, as evidenced by inducibility of a nuclear DNA
damage reporter, increased chromosomal instability including
recombination and mutation, and greater sensitivity to DNA-damaging
agents, as well as slow growth. Addition of a human frataxin mutant did
not prevent nuclear damage, although it partially complemented the YFH1
mutant in preventing mitochondrial DNA loss. The effects in YFH1 mutants
appeared to result from reactive oxygen species, since (1) YFH1 cells
produce more hydrogen peroxide, (2) the effects are alleviated by the
radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine, and (3) the glutathione peroxidase
gene (GPX1; 138320) prevents an increase in mutation rates. The authors
concluded that the frataxin protein has a protective role for the
nucleus as well as the mitochondria.

Muhlenhoff et al. (2002) constructed a yeast strain (Gal-YFH1) that
carried the YFH1 gene under the control of a galactose-regulated
promoter. Yfh1p-deficient Gal-YFH1 cells were far less sensitive to
oxidative stress than delta-yfh1 mutants, maintained mitochondrial DNA,
and synthesized heme at wildtype rates. Yfh1p depletion caused a strong
reduction in the assembly of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins, which may
explain the respiratory deficiency of Gal-YFH1 cells. Yfh1p-depleted
Gal-YFH1 cells show decreased maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins and
accumulation of mitochondrial iron, which may be seen secondary to
defects in cytosolic Fe/S protein assembly. The authors proposed a
specific role of frataxin in the biosynthesis of cellular Fe/S proteins
which excluded most of the previously suggested functions.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking the Yfh1 gene showed very low
cytochrome content. Lesuisse et al. (2003) showed that in delta-yfh1
strains, the level of ferrochelatase (612386) was very low as a result
of transcriptional repression of HEM15. However, the low amount of
ferrochelatase was not the cause of heme deficiency in delta-yfh1 cells.
Ferrochelatase, a mitochondrial protein able to mediate insertion of
iron or zinc into the porphyrin precursor, made primarily the zinc
protoporphyrin product. Yfh1p and ferrochelatase were shown to interact
in vitro by BIAcore studies. Lesuisse et al. (2003) concluded that Yfh1
mediates iron use by ferrochelatase.

Karthikeyan et al. (2003) developed a highly regulatable promoter system
for expressing frataxin in yeast to address the consequences of
chronically reduced amounts of this protein. Shutting off the promoter
resulted in changes normally associated with loss of frataxin, including
iron accumulation within the mitochondria and the induction of
mitochondrial 'petite' phenotype mutants. While there was considerable
oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins, the 'petites' were likely
due to accumulation of mitochondrial DNA lesions and subsequent DNA
loss. Chronically reduced frataxin levels resulted in similar response
patterns. Furthermore, nuclear DNA damage was detected in a rad52 (see
600392) mutant, deficient in double-strand break repair. Karthikeyan et
al. (2003) concluded that reduced frataxin levels, which may be more
representative of the disease state in Friedreich ataxia, resulted in
considerable oxidative damage in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA.

Campanella et al. (2004) expressed human mitochondrial ferritin (FTMT;
608847) in frataxin-deficient yeast cells. The human FTMT precursor was
efficiently imported by yeast mitochondria and processed to functional
ferritin that actively sequestered iron in the organelle. FTMT
expression rescued the respiratory deficiency caused by the loss of
frataxin protecting the activity of iron-sulfur enzymes and enabling
frataxin-deficient cells to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources.
Furthermore, FTMT expression prevented the development of mitochondrial
iron overload, preserved mitochondrial DNA integrity, and increased cell
resistance to H2O2. Campanella et al. (2004) concluded that FTMT can
substitute for most frataxin functions in yeast, suggesting that
frataxin may be directly involved in mitochondrial iron-binding and
detoxification.

Gonzalez-Cabo et al. (2005) showed that Yfh1 interacted physically with
succinate dehydrogenase complex subunits Sdh1 (SDHA; 600857) and Sdh2
(SDHB; 185470) of the yeast mitochondrial electron transport chain and
also with electron transfer flavoprotein complex ETF-alpha (608053) and
ETF-beta (130410) subunits from the electron transfer flavoprotein
complex. Genetic synthetic interaction experiments confirmed a
functional relationship between Yfh1 and Sdh1/Sdh2, and
coimmunoprecipitation showed physical interaction between human frataxin
and SDH1/SDH2, suggesting also a key role of frataxin in the
mitochondrial electron transport chain in humans. Gonzalez-Cabo et al.
(2005) suggested a direct participation of the respiratory chain in the
pathogenesis of Friedreich ataxia, and proposed that it be considered as
an OXPHOS disease.

Yfh1 interacts functionally and physically with Isu1 (ISCU; 611911), the
scaffold protein on which the Fe/S clusters are assembled. Leidgens et
al. (2010) generated 12 yeast Yfh1 mutants in conserved residues of the
frataxin beta-sheet. The Q129A, I130A, W131A(F), and R141A mutations,
which reside in surface-exposed residues of beta-strands, resulted in
severe cell growth inhibition on high-iron media and low aconitase
activity, indicating that Fe/S cluster biosynthesis was impaired. In
contrast, gln129, trp131, and arg141 residues (which are spatially
closely clustered) defined a patch important for protein function.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that W131A, unlike W131F, was
the sole mutation that strongly decreased the interaction with Isu1.
Leidgens et al. (2010) concluded that trp131, which is the only strictly
conserved frataxin residue in all sequenced species, appears essential
for interaction with Isu1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutation in the FXN gene has been shown to cause one form of Friedreich
ataxia (229300). Most patients with Friedreich ataxia have a GAA-repeat
expansion in the FXN gene. Delatycki et al. (1999) stated that 2% of
cases of Friedreich ataxia are due to point mutations, the other 98%
being due to expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1. They
indicated that 17 mutations had been described.

Campuzano et al. (1996) screened 184 patients with Friedreich ataxia for
point mutations by PCR amplification of exons. Three different point
mutations were found (606829.0002- 606829.0004). Seventy-nine unrelated
FRDA patients, including 5 with point mutations, were screened for the
GAA repeat expansion in the first intron (606829.0001). In the group of
74 patients without a point mutation, 71 were found to be homozygous for
expanded alleles, and 3 were heterozygous for the expanded repeat. The 5
patients shown to carry point mutations were all found to be
heterozygous for the repeat, and the repeat and the polymorphism had
different parental origin. Repeat expansions in the patients were
typically between 200 and 900 copies. In controls, the repeat expansion
varied from 7 to 22 copies.

Delatycki et al. (1998) studied FRDA mutations in 66 Australian
patients. One of 56 parents had a premutation with 1 normal allele and 1
allele of approximately 100 repeats in leukocyte DNA. His sperm showed
an expanded allele in a tight range centering on a size of approximately
320 repeats. His affected son had repeat sizes of 1,040 and 540. Of 33
other father-to-offspring transmissions, 17 showed a definite decrease
in allele size and 4 showed a decrease or no change; in 12 cases it was
not possible to say if the allele had expanded or contracted in size.
The authors stated that in all informative carrier father-to-affected
child transmissions, other than in the premutation carrier, the
expansion size decreased. Delatycki et al. (1998) concluded that
expansion of the FRDA gene occurs in 2 stages, the first during meiosis
followed by a second mitotic expansion.

Gacy et al. (1998) showed that the GAA instability in Friedreich ataxia
is a DNA-directed mutation caused by improper DNA structure at the
repeat region. Unlike CAG or CGG repeats, which form hairpins, GAA
repeats form a YRY triple helix containing non-Watson-Crick pairs. As
with hairpins, triplex mediates intergenerational instability in 96% of
transmissions. In families with Friedreich ataxia, GAA instability is
not a function of the number of long alleles, ruling out homologous
recombination or gene conversion as a major mechanism. The similarity of
mutation pattern among triple repeat-related diseases indicates that all
trinucleotide instability occurs by a common, intraallelic mechanism
that depends on DNA structure. Secondary structure mediates instability
by creating strong polymerase pause sites at or within the repeats,
facilitating slippage or sister chromatid exchange.

De Castro et al. (2000) analyzed DNA samples from a cohort of 241
patients with autosomal recessive or isolated spinocerebellar ataxia for
the GAA triplet expansion. They found 7 compound heterozygous patients.
In 4 patients, a point mutation that predicted a truncated frataxin was
detected. Three of them were associated with classic early-onset
Friedreich ataxia with an expanded GAA allele greater than 800 repeats.
The fourth patient had disease onset at the late age of 29 years with a
350-GAA repeat expansion. In 2 patients manifesting the classic
phenotype, no changes were observed by SSCP analysis. Linkage analysis
in a family with 2 affected children with an ataxic syndrome, one of
them showing heterozygosity for the GAA expansion, confirmed no linkage
to the FRDA locus. Most point mutations in compound heterozygous
Friedreich patients are null mutations. In their collection of compound
heterozygotes, clinical phenotypes seemed to be related to the GAA
repeat number in the expanded allele.

To investigate the genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic
cerebellar ataxia, Schols et al. (2000) tested for CAG/CTG trinucleotide
repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2 (SCA2; 183090), 3
(SCA3; 109150), 6 (SCA6; 183086), 7 (SCA7; 164500), 8 (SCA8; 608768),
and 12 (SCA12; 604326), and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124
patients, including 20 patients with the clinical diagnosis of multiple
system atrophy. Patients with a positive family history, atypical
Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic (secondary) ataxia were excluded.
Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10
patients with an age of onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation
was present in 9 patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of
age. The CTG repeat associated with SCA8 was expanded in 3 patients. One
patient had SCA2 attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally
transmitted, intermediate allele. Schols et al. (2000) did not identify
the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7, or SCA12 mutations in this group of idiopathic
sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected
in the multiple system atrophy subgroup. This study revealed the genetic
basis in 19% of apparently idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 was the most
frequent mutation in late-onset cerebellar ataxia. The authors concluded
that the frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in all
sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the
phenotype is atypical for Friedreich ataxia.

Sharma et al. (2002) used small-pool PCR to analyze somatic variability
among 7,190 individual FRDA molecules from peripheral blood DNA of
subjects carrying 12 different expanded alleles. Expanded alleles showed
a length-dependent increase in somatic variability, with mutation loads
ranging from 47 to 78%. There was a strong contraction bias among long
alleles (more than 500 triplets), which showed a 4-fold higher frequency
of large contractions versus expansions. Of all somatic mutations
scored, 5% involved contractions of more than 50% of the original allele
length, and 0.29% involved complete reversion to the normal/premutation
length (60 triplets or fewer). These observations contrasted sharply
with the strong expansion bias seen in CTG triplet repeats in myotonic
dystrophy (DM1; 160900). No somatic variability was detected in more
than 6000 individual FRDA molecules analyzed from 15 normal alleles (8
to 25 triplets). A premutation allele with 44 uninterrupted GAA repeats
was found to be unstable, ranging in size from 6 to 113 triplets, thus
establishing the threshold for somatic instability between 26 and 44 GAA
triplets. The authors concluded that expanded GAA alleles in Friedreich
ataxia are highly mutable and have a natural tendency to contract in
vivo, and that these properties may depend on multiple factors,
including DNA sequence, triplet-repeat length, and unknown cell
type-specific factors.

Sharma et al. (2004) reported 2 unrelated patients with late-onset
Friedreich ataxia who were compound heterozygous for a large clearly
pathogenic GAA expansion and a smaller 'borderline' GAA expansion in the
FXN gene. The first patient, who had expansions of 700 and 44 GAA
repeats, developed ataxia symptoms in her early forties. The second
patient, who had expansions of 915 and 66 GAA repeats, developed
symptoms in his late twenties. Genomic analysis of several different
tissues, including hair, skin, buccal cells, peripheral leukocytes, and
fibroblasts, showed somatic instability of both the 44 and 66 repeat
alleles. Cells from both patients showed an increase in mutation load,
the proportion of individual FRDA molecules that differed in length from
the constitutional allele by greater than 5%. Fifteen percent of the
GAA-44 and 75% of the GAA-66 cells contained alleles with greater than
66 repeats. The 53-year-old asymptomatic brother of the first patient
had alleles of 730 and 37 GAA repeats; the GAA-37 allele was somatically
stable. Sharma et al. (2004) concluded that borderline expanded FRDA
alleles ranging from 44 to 65 uninterrupted triplet repeats show somatic
variability and may result in a disease phenotype if a large enough
proportion of cells bear disease-causing expansions in pathologically
affected tissues. Thus, persons who are compound heterozygous for a
large repeat expansion and a borderline expansion have an increased risk
of disease development.

In order to gain insight into GAA triplet repeat instability, Clark et
al. (2004) analyzed all triplet repeats in the human genome. They
determined that the GAA triplet repeat has a significant tendency to
expand compared with all other triplet repeats. Eighty-nine percent of
GAA repeats of 8 or more map to the G/A islands of Alu elements, and 58%
map to Alu element poly(A) tails. Clark et al. (2004) found that only 2
other GAA repeats of 8 or more share the central Alu location seen at
the FRDA locus. Clark et al. (2004) theorized that the GAA repeat
coevolved with Alu elements during primate genomic evolution.

Pathogenic GAA repeat expansions in the FXN gene cause decreased mRNA
expression of FXN by inhibiting transcription. In peripheral blood cells
of 67 FRDA patients, Castaldo et al. (2008) used pyrosequencing to
perform a quantitative analysis of the methylation status of 5 CpG sites
located within intron 1 of the FXN gene, upstream of expanded GAA
repeats. FRDA patients had increased methylation compared to controls.
Significant differences were found for each CpG site tested, but the
largest differences were found for CpG1 and CpG2 (84.45% and 76.80%
methylation in patients compared to 19.65% and 23.34% in controls).
There was a direct correlation between triplet expansion size and
methylation at CpG1 and CpG2. In addition, a significant inverse
correlation was observed between methylation at CpG1 and CpG2 and age of
disease onset. Castaldo et al. (2008) concluded that epigenetic changes
in the FXN gene may cause or contribute to gene silencing in FRDA.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Filla et al. (1996) studied the relationship between the trinucleotide
(GAA) repeat length and clinical features in Friedreich ataxia. The
length of the FA alleles ranged from 201 to 1,186 repeat units. There
was no overlap between the size of normal alleles and the size of
alleles found in FA. The lengths of both the larger and the smaller
alleles varied inversely with the age of onset of the disorder. Filla et
al. (1996) reported that the mean allele length was significantly higher
in FA patients with diabetes and in those with cardiomyopathy. They
noted that there was meiotic instability with a median variation of 150
repeats. Isnard et al. (1997) examined the correlation between the
severity of left ventricular hypertrophy in Friedreich ataxia and the
number of GAA repeats. Left ventricular wall thickness was measured in
44 patients using M-mode echocardiography and correlated with GAA
expansion size on the smaller allele (267 to 1200 repeats). A
significant correlation was found (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001),
highlighting an important role for frataxin in the regulation of cardiac
hypertrophy.

In a study of 187 patients with autosomal recessive ataxia, Durr et al.
(1996) found that 140, with ages at onset ranging from 2 to 51 years,
were homozygous for a GAA expansion that had 120 to 1,700 repeats of the
trinucleotides. About one-quarter of the patients, despite being
homozygous, had atypical Friedreich ataxia; they were older at
presentation and had intact tendon reflexes. Larger GAA expansions
correlated with earlier age at onset and shorter times to loss of
ambulation. The size of the GAA expansions (and particularly that of the
smaller of each pair of alleles) was associated with the frequency of
cardiomyopathy and loss of reflexes in the upper limbs. The GAA repeats
were unstable during transmission. Thus, the clinical spectrum of
Friedreich ataxia is broader than previously recognized, and the direct
molecular test for the GAA expansion is useful for the diagnosis,
prognosis, and genetic counseling.

Pianese et al. (1997) presented data suggesting that (1) the FRDA GAA
repeat is highly unstable during meiosis, (2) contractions outnumber
expansions, (3) both parental source and sequence length are important
factors in variability of FRDA expanded alleles, and (4) the tendency to
contract or expand does not seem to be associated with particular
haplotypes. Thus, they concluded that FRDA gene variability appears to
be different from that found with other triplet diseases.

Bidichandani et al. (1997) found an atypical FRDA phenotype associated
with a remarkably slow rate of disease progression in a Caucasian
family. It was caused by compound heterozygosity for a G130V missense
mutation (606829.0005) and the GAA expansion of the X25 gene. The
missense mutation G130V was the second mutation to be identified in the
X25 gene and the first to be associated with a variant FRDA phenotype.
This and the other reported missense mutation (I154F; 229300.0004)
mapped within the highly conserved sequence domain in the C terminus of
the frataxin gene. Since the G130V mutation was unlikely to affect the
ability of the first 16 exons of the neighboring STM7 gene to encode a
functional phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase, Bidichandani et al.
(1997) questioned the role of STM7 in Friedreich ataxia.

Since Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disease, it does not
show typical features observed in other dynamic mutation disorders, such
as anticipation. Monros et al. (1997) analyzed the GAA repeat in 104 FA
patients and 163 carrier relatives previously defined by linkage
analysis. The GAA expansion was detected in all patients, most (94%) of
them being homozygous for the mutation. They demonstrated that clinical
variability in FA is related to the size of the expanded repeat: milder
forms of the disease (late-onset FA and FA with retained reflexes) were
associated with shorter expansions, especially with the smaller of the 2
expanded alleles. Absence of cardiomyopathy was also associated with
shorter alleles. Dynamics of the GAA repeat were investigated in 212
parent-offspring pairs. Meiotic instability showed a sex bias:
paternally transmitted alleles tended to decrease in a linear way that
depended on the paternal expansion size, whereas maternal alleles either
increased or decreased in size. All but 1 of the patients with
late-onset FA were homozygous for the GAA expansion; the exceptional
individual was heterozygous for the expansion and for another unknown
mutation. All but 1 of the FA patients with retained reflexes exhibited
an axonal sensory neuropathy. However, preservation of their tendon
reflexes suggested that the physiologic pathways of the reflex arch
remained functional. A close relationship was found between late-onset
disease and absence of heart muscle disease.

Delatycki et al. (1999) studied FRDA1 mutations in FA patients from
Eastern Australia. Of the 83 people studied, 78 were homozygous for an
expanded GAA repeat, while the other 5 had an expansion in one allele
and a point mutation in the other. The authors presented a detailed
study of 51 patients homozygous for an expanded GAA repeat. They
identified an association between the size of the smaller of the 2
expanded alleles and age at onset, age into wheelchair, scoliosis,
impaired vibration sense, and the presence of foot deformity. However,
no significant association was identified between the size of the
smaller allele and cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, loss of
proprioception, or bladder symptoms. The larger allele size was
associated with bladder symptoms and the presence of foot deformity.

Gellera et al. (2007) reported 13 FA patients from 12 unrelated Italian
families who were compound heterozygous for the GAA expansion and a
small mutation in the FXN gene. Two missense and 5 frameshift or
truncating mutations were identified (see, e.g., 606829.0007;
606829.0008). In all 13 patients, there was a significant inverse
correlation between GAA size and age at onset. In 6 patients, age at
onset correlated with residual protein level, and GAA size inversely
correlated with residual protein level. Clinical data were consistent
with the hypothesis that FXN mutations are more severe than GAA
expansions. In patients with a null mutation and the GAA expansion, age
at onset was strongly dependent on the size of the expansion, indicating
that residual protein function derived from the expanded allele.

HISTORY

Duclos et al. (1993) identified a transcript containing the conserved
sequences around the D9S5 locus. The 7-kb transcript corresponded to a
gene designated X11 (APBA1; 602414) which extended at least 80 kb in a
direction opposite D9S15. The gene was expressed in the brain, including
the cerebellum, but was not detectable in several nonneuronal tissues
and cell lines. In situ hybridization of adult mouse brain sections
showed prominent expression in the granular layer of the cerebellum.
Expression was also found in the spinal cord. The cDNA contained an open
reading frame encoding a 708-amino acid sequence that showed no
significant similarity to other known proteins but contained a unique,
24-residue, putative transmembrane segment. On the basis of these
findings, Duclos et al. (1993) suggested that this 'pioneer' gene
represents the FRDA gene. Further studies by Rodius et al. (1994)
excluded X11 as a candidate for the Friedreich ataxia gene.

Carvajal et al. (1995) reported the isolation of a gene from the FRDA
critical region. Although no evidence of mutation was detected in the
transcript, the sequence, which they designated STM7 (602745),
represented only one of the shorter alternatively spliced species
identified by Northern analysis and direct sequencing. Carvajal et al.
(1995) still considered the gene a strong candidate for FRDA. Carvajal
et al. (1996) reported that the X25 gene (frataxin-encoding gene)
described by Campuzano et al. (1996) comprises part of STM7. They
reported that the transcription of both STM7 and X25 occurs from the
centromere toward the telomere, that the reported sequences of STM7 and
X25 did not represent a full-length transcript, that multiple
transcripts for each of these genes are present in Northern blots, and
that several of these transcripts are of similar size. Carvajal et al.
(1996) also reported that less than 10 kb separates the CpG island
identified in the X25/exon 1 from the 3-prime end of STM7/exon 16. They
further demonstrated that the recombinant protein corresponding to the
STM7.1 transcript has phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase
activity. They noted that the ataxia-telangiectasia gene (607585) has
C-terminal similarity to the catalytic domains of phosphatidylinositol
phosphate 3-kinases. This homology, and the observation by Matsumoto et
al. (1996) of an ataxia phenotype in mice lacking the type 1
inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (147265), provided support for a
defect in the phosphoinositide pathway constituting the pathogenetic
basis of Friedreich ataxia.

Cossee et al. (1997) concluded that there was no strong argument for a
role of STM7 in Friedreich ataxia, while the presence of mutations in
the frataxin gene fulfilled all criteria required of the FRDA gene. In
reply, Chamberlain et al. (1997) presented additional data and stated
the opinion that 'Cossee et al. have failed to present either a
plausible explanation for our original observations or a definitive
argument to contradict our interpretation of the data.' In rebuttal,
Pandolfo (1997) pointed out that no data have been presented showing the
existence of STM7/frataxin transcripts with methods other than RT-PCR,
the existence of a defect in PIP kinase activity in Friedreich patients,
or the existence of disease-causing mutations in STM7. In a review
article, Koenig and Mandel (1997) stated that there was strong evidence
negating the claim that the frataxin exons are alternative 3-prime STM7
exons, namely, the structure of frataxin cDNAs and mouse intronless
pseudogenes, the nature of point mutations found in some patients, and
the size of the endogenous frataxin protein.

ANIMAL MODEL

Koutnikova et al. (1997) cloned the complete coding region of mouse
frataxin and studied its pattern of expression in developing and adult
tissues. They found by in situ hybridization analyses that mouse
frataxin expression correlated well with the main site of
neurodegeneration in Friedreich ataxia, but the expression pattern was
broader than expected from the pathology of the disease. Frataxin mRNA
was predominantly expressed in tissues with a high metabolic rate,
including liver, kidney, brown fat, and heart. They showed that mouse
and yeast frataxin homologs contain a potential mitochondrial targeting
sequence in their N-terminal domains and that disruption of the yeast
gene results in mitochondrial dysfunction.

Cossee et al. (2000) generated a mouse model of Friedreich ataxia by
deletion of exon 4 of the Frda gene, leading to inactivation of the Frda
gene product. Homozygous deletions caused embryonic lethality a few days
after implantation; no iron accumulation was observed during embryonic
resorption, suggesting that cell death may be due to a mechanism
independent of iron accumulation. The authors suggested that the milder
phenotype in humans may be due to residual frataxin expression
associated with the expansion mutations.

Through a conditional gene targeting approach, Puccio et al. (2001)
generated in parallel a striated muscle frataxin-deficient mouse line
and a neuron/cardiac muscle frataxin-deficient line, which Seznec et al.
(2004) showed that in frataxin-deficient mice, Fe-S enzyme deficiency
occurred at 4 weeks of age, prior to cardiac dilatation and concomitant
development of left ventricular hypertrophy, while mitochondrial iron
accumulation occurred at a terminal stage. The antioxidant idebenone
delayed the cardiac disease onset, progression and death of
frataxin-deficient animals by 1 week, but did not correct the Fe-S
enzyme deficiency. The authors concluded that frataxin is a necessary,
albeit nonessential, component of the Fe-S cluster biogenesis, and that
idebenone acts downstream of the primary Fe-S enzyme deficit.

Thierbach et al. (2005) disrupted expression of frataxin specifically in
murine hepatocytes to generate mice with impaired mitochondrial function
and decreased oxidative phosphorylation. These animals had a reduced
life span and developed multiple hepatic tumors. Livers also showed
increased oxidative stress, impaired respiration, and reduced ATP levels
paralleled by reduced activity of iron-sulfur cluster (Fe/S)-containing
proteins, which all led to increased hepatocyte turnover by promoting
both apoptosis and proliferation. Accordingly, phosphorylation of the
stress-inducible p38 MAP kinase (600289) was specifically impaired
following disruption of frataxin. The authors hypothesized that frataxin
may act as a mitochondrial tumor suppressor protein in mammals.

Schoenfeld et al. (2005) microarrayed murine frataxin-deficient heart
tissue, liver tissue, and cardiocytes and observed a transcript
downregulation to upregulation ratio of nearly 2:1 with a mitochondrial
localization of transcriptional changes. Combining all mouse and human
microarray data for frataxin-deficient cells and tissues, the most
consistently decreased transcripts were mitochondrial coproporphyrinogen
oxidase (CPOX; 121300) of the heme pathway and mature T-cell
proliferation 1, a homolog of yeast COX23, which is thought to function
as a mitochondrial metallochaperone. Quantitative RT-PCR studies
confirmed the significant downregulation of Isu1 (ISCU; 611911), CPOX,
and ferrochelatase at 10 weeks in mouse hearts. Mutant cells were
resistant to aminolevulinate-dependent toxicity, and there was increased
cellular protoporphyrin IX levels, reduced mitochondrial heme a and heme
c levels, and reduced activity of cytochrome oxidase, suggesting a
defect between protoporphyrin IX and heme a. Fe-chelatase activities
were similar in mutants and controls, whereas Zn-chelatase activities
were slightly elevated in mutants, supporting the idea of an altered
metal-specificity of ferrochelatase. The authors suggested that frataxin
deficiency may cause defects late in the heme pathway. Since ataxic
symptoms occur in other diseases of heme deficiency, the authors
suggested that the heme defect observed in frataxin-deficient cells
could be primary to the pathophysiological process.

Anderson et al. (2005) used RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the
Drosophila frataxin homolog (Dfh) and observed. distinct phenotypes in
larvae and adults, leading to giant long-lived larvae and to conditional
short-lived adults. Drosophila frataxin silencing differentially
dysregulated ferritin expression in adults but not in larvae, Silencing
of Dfh in the peripheral nervous system, a specific focus of Friedreich
pathology, permitted normal larval development but imposed a marked
reduction in adult life span. In contrast, Dfh silencing in motor
neurons had no deleterious effect in either larvae or adults. Finally,
overexpression of Sod1 (147450), Sod2 (147460), or Cat (115500) did not
suppress the failure of Dfh-deficient flies to successfully complete
eclosion, suggesting a minimal role of oxidative stress in this
phenotype.

Clark et al. (2007) found that transgenic mice carrying expanded human
FXN GAA repeats (190 or 82 triplets) showed tissue-specific and
age-dependent somatic instability specifically in the cerebellum and
dorsal root ganglia. The GAA(190) allele showed some instability by 2
months and significant expansion by 12 months, slightly greater than
that of GAA(82), suggesting that somatic instability was also repeat
length-dependent. There were lower levels of repeat expansion in
proliferating tissues, indicating that DNA replication per se was
unlikely to be a major cause of age-dependent expansion.

Anderson et al. (2008) showed that ectopic expression of H2O2 scavengers
suppressed the deleterious phenotypes associated with frataxin
deficiency in a Drosophila model of FRDA. In contrast, augmentation with
superoxide scavengers had no effect. Augmentation of endogenous catalase
(CAT; 115500) restored the activity of reactive oxygen species-sensitive
mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2; 100850) and enhanced resistance to H2O2
exposure, both of which were diminished by frataxin deficiency. Anderson
et al. (2008) concluded that H2O2 is an important pathologic substrate
underlying the phenotypes arising from frataxin deficiency in
Drosophila.

Coppola et al. (2009) performed microarray analysis of heart and
skeletal muscle in a mouse model of frataxin deficiency, and found
molecular evidence of increased lipogenesis in skeletal muscle, and
alteration of fiber-type composition in heart, consistent with insulin
resistance and cardiomyopathy, respectively. Since the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG; 601487) pathway is known
to regulate both processes, the authors hypothesized that dysregulation
of this pathway could play a key role in frataxin deficiency. They
demonstrated a coordinate dysregulation of the PPARG coactivator Pgc1a
(PPARGC1A; 604517) and transcription factor Srebp1 (SREBF1; 184756) in
cellular and animal models of frataxin deficiency, and in cells from
FRDA patients, who have marked insulin resistance. Genetic modulation of
the PPAR-gamma pathway affected frataxin levels in vitro, supporting
PPAR-gamma as a potential therapeutic target in FRDA.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA WITH RETAINED REFLEXES, INCLUDED
FXN, (GAA)n EXPANSION

GAA triplet repeat expansions between 200 and 900 copies in the first
intron of the frataxin gene occurred in 71 of 74 FRDA (229300) patients
studied by Campuzano et al. (1996). In unaffected individuals, the
triplet repeat expansion numbered between 7 and 20 units.

Among 101 FRDA patients homozygous for GAA expansion within the X25
gene, Coppola et al. (1999) found that 11 patients from 8 families had
FRDA with retained reflexes in the lower limbs (FARR; see 229300). The
mean size of the smaller allele was significantly less (408 +/- 252 vs
719 +/- 184 GAA triplets) in FARR patients.

.0002
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, LEU106TER

In 2 affected members of a French family with Friedreich ataxia
(229300), Campuzano et al. (1996) identified compound heterozygosity for
the FRDA expansion repeat (606829.0001) and a T-to-G transversion in
exon 3 that changed a leucine (TTA) to a stop (TGA). The L106X mutation
came from the father; the other allele carrying the expansion was from
the mother.

.0003
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, IVS3, A-G, -2

Campuzano et al. (1996) found compound heterozygosity in a member of a
Spanish family with Friedreich ataxia (229300) for the FRDA expansion
repeat (606829.0001) and an A-to-G transition which disrupted the
acceptor splice site at the end of the third intron.

.0004
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, ILE154PHE

Campuzano et al. (1996) studied 5 patients with Friedreich ataxia
(229300) from 3 different Italian families and identified a change from
isoleucine-154 to phenylalanine in exon 4. These patients were
heterozygous for the FRDA expansion repeat (606829.0001). This I154F
mutation was found to occur in 1 out of 417 chromosomes examined from
the same Southern Italian population. Isoleucine at this position was
highly conserved across species. (Koutnikova et al. (1998) referred to
this mutation as ILE151PHE.)

Shan et al. (2007) showed that the I145F mutation did not affect FXN
protein expression following transfection of HEK293T cells. However,
I145F interfered with the interaction of FXN with ISD11 (LYRM4; 613311).

.0005
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, GLY130VAL

Bidichandani et al. (1997) found compound heterozygosity for the GAA
triplet-repeat expansion (606829.0001) and a novel missense mutation,
G130V, in 3 sibs with variant Friedreich ataxia (229300). Three of 6
sibs were affected: a male age 42, a male age 39, and a female age 35.
Onset of disease was in the early teens, starting with weakness in the
lower limbs and followed by gradual progression over the ensuing 20
years. Two brothers were still ambulatory, using either a walking stick
or walker, and led fully productive working lives. Their upper limbs
were affected to a lesser extent than their legs and lacked several key
signs. They had sensory loss over the distal limbs, mild to moderate
motor weakness, impaired position and vibratory sense, and hypo- or
areflexia. Bilateral Babinski sign was also present in 1 brother. There
was no atrophy, and muscle tone was normal. Notably, there was no
dysarthria, and coordination was either very mildly affected or normal.
Nerve conduction studies revealed slowing of motor-conduction velocities
and absent sensory-evoked responses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
revealed cervical spinal cord atrophy. No cardiac abnormalities were
detected. Blood glucose levels were borderline elevated, and mild
glucose intolerance was revealed in a 5-hour glucose-tolerance test. The
sister was somewhat more physically incapacitated than her older 2
brothers. (Koutnikova et al. (1998) referred to this mutation as
GLY127VAL.)

By haplotype analysis in the 4 families that had been described with the
G130V mutation, Delatycki et al. (1999) found results suggesting a
common founder.

Using transfected HEK293T cells, Shan et al. (2007) showed that the
G130V mutation interfered with FXN protein expression.

.0006
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, MET1ILE

In 3 independent families, Zuhlke et al. (1998) found that affected
individuals with Friedreich ataxia (229300) were compound heterozygotes
for the repeat expansion (606829.0001) and an ATG-to-ATT (met1-to-ile;
M1I) mutation of the start codon of the FXN gene. Haplotype analysis
using 6 polymorphic chromosome 9 markers showed complete identity of
haplotype in 2 of the 3 chromosomes with the point mutation; the third
case showed partial conformity and may represent a single recombination
event. A common ancestor was suspected. An M1I start codon mutation has
been described in the HBB gene (141900.0430) as the cause of
beta-0-thalassemia, in the OAT gene (258870.0001) as the cause of gyrate
atrophy, in the PAH gene (261600.0048) as the cause of phenylketonuria,
and in the PLP gene (312080.0015) as the cause of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher
disease, but in all of these instances the nucleotide change represented
an ATG-to-ATA transition.

.0007
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, TRP173GLY

In 2 unrelated patients with Friedreich ataxia (229300), Cossee et al.
(1999) identified a TGG-to-GGG change in exon 5a of the FXN gene,
resulting in a trp173-to-gly (W173G) substitution.

Gellera et al. (2007) identified a 517T-G transversion, resulting in a
W173G substitution, in compound heterozygosity with the GAA expansion
(606829.0001) in FA patients from 3 unrelated families of Italian
origin. All patients had a severe form of the disorder with relatively
early onset and presence of cardiomyopathy.

Using transfected HEK293T cells, Shan et al. (2007) showed that the
W173G mutation interfered with FXN protein expression.

.0008
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, 1-BP DEL, 157C

Gellera et al. (2007) identified a 1-bp deletion (157delC) in the FXN
gene in compound heterozygosity with the GAA expansion (606829.0001) in
patients with Friedreich ataxia (229300) from 4 unrelated families of
Italian origin. The 1-bp deletion resulted in a frameshift and premature
termination of the protein at codon 75. Three of the patients who had
greater than 700 repeat expansions had onset by age 10 years. The fourth
patient, with 170 repeats, had onset at age 32 years.

.0009
FRIEDREICH ATAXIA
FXN, 6-BP DEL/15-BP INS, NT371

In 2 sibs with a rapidly progressive and severe Friedreich ataxia
(229300), Evans-Galea et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity
for a GAA expansion of 1,010 repeats in the FXN gene (606829.0001) and a
deletion-insertion mutation in exon 3 (c.371_376del6ins15). The
deletion-insertion mutation was predicted to change amino acid positions
124 through 127 from DVSF to VHLEDT, increasing frataxin from 211 to 214
residues. The mutant protein, if expressed, would have an altered acidic
patch, impairing the interaction of FXN with iron and with the
iron-sulphur cluster assembly factor. One sib had onset at age 4 years
and was wheelchair-bound by age 8. The other had onset at age 5 years
and was wheelchair-bound by age 10. Both had hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, dysarthria, kyphoscoliosis, decreased joint range,
spasticity, and reduced hand function. Other features included diabetes
mellitus and abnormal ocular function. One patient died at age 20 years.

;;SMALL NUCLEAR RNA-ACTIVATING PROTEIN COMPLEX, 50-KD SUBUNIT; SNAP50;;
PSE-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, BETA;;
PTF-BETA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNAPC3 encodes a subunit of the snRNA-activating protein complex
(SNAPc), which is required for transcription of both RNA polymerase II
and III snRNA genes (see SNAPC1, 600591).

CLONING

Henry et al. (1996) identified the gene for the 50-kD subunit of SNAPc
based on partial sequence from the purified protein. The predicted
411-amino acid protein, designated SNAP50, is highly charged (pI = 4.9),
and has 2 potential zinc finger domains. Henry et al. (1996) used
anti-SNAP50 antibodies in immunoprecipitation and in vitro transcription
studies to demonstrate that SNAP50 is part of SNAPc and is required for
RNA polymerase II and III snRNA gene transcription. UV crosslinking
studies suggest that SNAP50 is in close proximity to the DNA when SNAPc
is bound to the proximal sequence element (PSE) of the promoter.

;;FE65-LIKE 1; FE65L1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The cytoplasmic domain of the Alzheimer disease locus amyloid protein
precursor (APP; 104760) binds 4 human phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB)
proteins; see APBA1 (602414). By use of a yeast 2-hybrid screening of a
human brain cDNA library, McLoughlin and Miller (1996) identified 3 of
these proteins: the human homolog of Fe65 (APBB1; 602709), an Fe65-like
sequence (APBB2), and an X11-like sequence (APBA2; 602712). From a human
fetal brain cDNA library, Guenette et al. (1996) also cloned APBB2 based
on its interaction with the carboxy terminus of APP. They showed that
the APBB2 protein interacts with another amyloid protein precursor,
APLP2 (104776), but not with APLP1 (104775). The APBB2 gene encodes a
730-amino acid polypeptide that is 51% identical to rat Fe65. Northern
blot analysis revealed that APBB2 has widespread expression in human
tissues.

MAPPING

By use of a radiation hybrid panel, Blanco et al. (1998) mapped the
human APBB2 gene to chromosome 4, between the markers D4S405 (4.6 cR)
and D4S496 (10.1 cR).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Since the APBB2 gene encodes a protein that is capable of binding to
amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), which is central to the
pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (104300), Li et al. (2005) performed a
genetic association study of APBB2 and late-onset Alzheimer disease
(104310) in 3 independently collected case-control series totaling
approximately 2,000 samples. They found that one SNP (dbSNP rs13133980),
located in a region conserved between the human and mouse genomes,
showed a significant interaction with age of disease onset. For this
marker, Li et al. (2005) reported the association with late-onset
Alzheimer disease was most pronounced in subjects with disease onset
before 75 years of age; odds ratio for homozygotes = 2.43 and for
heterozygotes = 2.15.

;;VALACYCLOVIRASE;;
MUCIN-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN; MCNAA;;
BREAST EPITHELIAL MUCIN-ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The serine hydrolases, including BPHL, are defined as a functional class
of hydrolytic enzymes that contain a serine residue in their active
site. They can be grouped into subfamilies that contain closely related
members in terms of substrate specificity or amino acid sequence
similarity (Puente and Lopez-Otin, 1995).

CLONING

By immunoscreening an expression library prepared from human lactating
breast tissue, Larocca et al. (1990) obtained a partial BPHL cDNA, which
they called BA70-1. Northern blot analysis detected a major 1.8-kb
transcript and a minor 0.65-kb transcript in human breast tumor cell
lines and several other carcinoma cell lines.

Puente and Lopez-Otin (1995) isolated a full-length human breast
carcinoma cDNA encoding a novel serine hydrolase, BPHL. The deduced
274-amino acid protein shows significant sequence similarity to
prokaryotic enzymes involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds;
the highest identities, about 25%, are to 4 serine hydrolases encoded by
the bphD genes of different strains of Pseudomonas, all of which degrade
biphenyl derivatives. Recombinant BPHL protein demonstrated serine
hydrolase activity that was abolished by a covalent inhibitor of serine
hydrolases. By Northern blot analysis of human tissues, the authors
detected a major 1.8-kb BPHL transcript, with highest levels in liver
and kidney, and a minor 2.4-kb transcript. They showed that BPHL is
expressed as an approximately 30-kD protein in human liver using Western
blot analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Valacyclovir (VACV) is the 5-prime valyl ester prodrug of acyclovir, an
effective antiherpetic drug. VACV is relatively stable in gut lumen
while very susceptible to intracellular enzymatic hydrolysis. Kim et al.
(2003) found that the VACV hydrolase associated with human colon
carcinoma cell membranes is BPHL. Gel filtration chromatography detected
the enzyme at an apparent molecular mass of 27 kD. Hydrolysis of VACV by
recombinant BPHL was concentration-dependent, showed highest activity in
the pH range of 7.4 to 8.0, and was sensitive to serine hydrolase
inhibitors and a free thiol modifier, suggesting that cysteines as well
as serines have a role in the catalytic function of BPHL.

GENE STRUCTURE

Puente et al. (1998) determined that the BPHL gene spans approximately
30 kb and contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Puente et al. (1998) localized the BPHL gene to chromosome
6p25.

606406	TITLE *606406 NUCLEAR PORE COMPLEX-INTERACTING PROTEIN; NPIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ohno (1970) observed that gene duplication followed by adaptive
evolution is a primary force for the emergence of new gene function.
Johnson et al. (2001) described such a proliferative event in a 20-kb
duplicated segment termed LCR16a (low-copy repeat sequence 'a' from
chromosome 16) that occurred after the divergence of humans and African
apes from Old World monkeys. Whereas 1 or 2 copies of the segment could
be found in baboons, there are 9, 17, 15, and 25 to 30 copies in
orangutans, gorillas, humans, and chimpanzees, respectively. Within this
segment, Johnson et al. (2001) identified the NPIP gene by genomic
sequence analysis and yeast 2-hybrid screening. The deduced 347-amino
acid NPIP protein is membrane bound. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated localization of NPIP to the nuclear membrane and
colocalization with nucleoporin p62 (NUP62; 605815). Johnson et al.
(2001) suggested that the existence of genes that have recently (within
the last 30 million years) duplicated and have rapidly evolved may
account for 5 to 7% of all human sequences, and they may lack definitive
orthologs in the genomes of model organisms.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Johnson et al. (2001) determined that the
NPIP gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

Johnson et al. (2001) mapped the NPIP gene to 16p13.1 by FISH. The
localization was confirmed for other hominoid species and extended to
chromosomes 7 and 17 in both chimpanzees and bonobos, while in
orangutans Npip is found on chromosomes 16 and 13.

160782	TITLE *160782 MYOSIN, LIGHT CHAIN 5, REGULATORY; MYL5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Myosin participates in various cellular functions ranging from
cytokinesis, receptor capping, and secretion to sarcomere contraction.
In the course of studying a region of 4p16.3 where the Huntington
disease (HD; 143100) locus is located, Collins et al. (1992) found a
gene that maps 7 kb proximal to, and in same transcriptional polarity
as, the gene for the beta subunit of rod cell photoreceptor cGMP
photodiesterase (PDEB; 180072). Analysis of both nucleotide and
predicted amino acid sequences suggested that this gene encodes a novel
myosin light chain isoprotein, MYL5. Identical cDNAs were isolated from
human adult retina and fetal muscle cDNA libraries. Expression of the
gene was detected in adult retina, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and fetal
skeletal muscle. MYL5 is a regulatory light chain of the MLC2 (160781)
type. (Myosin is a hexameric ATPase composed of 2 heavy chains (MHC), 2
nonphosphorylated alkali light chains (MLC-1/3), and 2 phosphorylatable
regulatory light chains (MLC2).)

MAPPING

The MYL5 gene maps 700 kb from the 4p telomere (Collins et al., 1992).

;;DROSOPHILA FAT FACETS-RELATED, X-LINKED; DFFRX;;
FAM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Jones et al. (1996) reported that an expressed sequence tag (EST 221)
derived from human adult testis shares homology with the Drosophila fat
facets (faf) gene. They detected related sequences on both the human X
and Y chromosomes. They used EST 221 to derive clones covering the
complete open reading frame of the X-specific locus, which they termed
DFFRX. Y-specific cDNA clones were derived, and they termed that locus
DFFRY (400005). Over the 2 regions corresponding to nucleotides 6 to
1901 and nucleotides 5815 to 7907 of the DFFRX sequence, the X- and
Y-specific sequences share 91% and 88% identity, respectively. Both
putative gene products contain conserved cysteine and histidine domains
that have been described in ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (e.g.,
191342). Northern blot analysis of 16 different adult human tissues with
the EST 221 revealed expression in all tissues. They also detected both
DFFRX and DFFRY expression in developing human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Jones et al. (1996) determined the X inactivation status of DFFRX
through use of quantitative RT-PCR with X-specific primers and found
that the level of DFFRX expression rises as the copy number of the X
chromosome increases, indicating that DFFRX escapes inactivation. In
Drosophila the faf gene has been shown to be important in eye function
and in oocyte development. The high degree of conservation between the
Drosophila faf gene and the DFFRX sequence led Jones et al. (1996) to
conclude that DFFRX has an important function in humans.

Proper chromosome segregation requires the attachment of sister
kinetochores to microtubules from opposite spindle poles to form
bioriented chromosomes on the metaphase spindle. The chromosome
passenger complex containing survivin (603352) and the kinase aurora B
(604970) regulates this process from the centromeres. Vong et al. (2005)
reported that a deubiquitinating enzyme, FAM, also known as USP9X,
regulates chromosome alignment and segregation by controlling both the
dynamic association of survivin with centromeres and the proper
targeting of survivin and aurora B to centromeres. Survivin is
ubiquitinated in mitosis through both lys48 and lys63 ubiquitin
linkages. Lys63 deubiquitination mediated by FAM is required for the
dissociation of survivin from centromeres, whereas lys63 ubiquitination
mediated by the ubiquitin-binding protein UFD1 (601754) is required for
the association of survivin with centromeres. Thus, ubiquitination
regulates dynamic protein-protein interactions and chromosome
segregation independently of protein degradation.

Schwickart et al. (2010) showed that the deubiquitinase USP9X binds to
and stabilizes MCL1 (159552) and removes the lys48-linked polyubiquitin
chains that normally mark MCL1 for proteasomal degradation. Increased
USP9X expression correlated with increased MCL1 protein in human
follicular lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Moreover,
patients with multiple myeloma overexpressing USP9X have a poor
prognosis. Knockdown of USP9X increased MCL1 polyubiquitination, which
enhances MCL1 turnover and cell killing by the BH3 mimetic ABT-737.
Schwickart et al. (2010) concluded that their results identified USP9X
as a prognostic and therapeutic target and showed that deubiquitinases
may stabilize labile oncoproteins in human malignancies.

MAPPING

Jones et al. (1996) mapped DFFRX to Xp11.4 by somatic cell hybrid
analysis and a YAC library screen. They noted that the map location
coincides with the region of the X chromosome defined by partial
deletions as being critical for the major stigmata associated with
Turner syndrome (163950). They raised the possibility that DFFRX plays a
role in the defects of oocyte proliferation and subsequent gonadal
degeneration found in Turner syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Perez-Mancera et al. (2012) used 'Sleeping Beauty' transposon-mediated
insertional mutagenesis in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal
preneoplasia to identify genes that cooperate with oncogenic Kras(G12D)
(190070.0003) to accelerate tumorigenesis and promote progression. This
screen revealed novel candidate genes for pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDA) and confirmed the importance of many genes and
pathways previously implicated in human PDA. The most commonly mutated
gene was the X-linked deubiquitinase Usp9x, which was inactivated in
over 50% of the tumors. Although previous work had attributed a
presurvival role to USP9X in human neoplasia, Perez-Mancera et al.
(2012) found instead that loss of Usp9x enhances transformation and
protects pancreatic cancer cells from anoikis. Clinically, low USP9X
protein and mRNA expression in PDA correlates with poor survival after
surgery, and USP9X levels are inversely associated with metastatic
burden in advanced disease. Furthermore, chromatin modulation with
trichostatin A or 5-aza-2-prime-deoxycytidine elevates USP9X expression
in human PDA cell lines, indicating a clinical approach for certain
patients. The conditional deletion of Usp9x cooperated with Kras(G12D)
to accelerate pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice, validating their genetic
interaction. Perez-Mancera et al. (2012) proposed that USP9X is a major
tumor suppressor gene with prognostic and therapeutic relevance in PDA.

609051	TITLE *609051 CASPASE RECRUITMENT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 8; CARD8
;;TUMOR-UPREGULATED CARD-CONTAINING ANTAGONIST OF CASP9; TUCAN;;
CARD INHIBITOR OF NFKB-ACTIVATING LIGANDS; CARDINAL;;
NDPP1;;
KIAA0955
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing proteins, such as CARD8,
are involved in pathways leading to activation of caspases or nuclear
factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) in the context of apoptosis or
inflammation, respectively (Bouchier-Hayes et al., 2001).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1999) cloned CARD8, which they designated
KIAA0955. The transcript contains several repetitive elements in the
3-prime UTR, and the deduced protein contains 431 amino acids. RT-PCR
ELISA detected highest expression of CARD8 in kidney and corpus callosum
and lowest expression in pancreas. All other tissues and specific brain
regions examined showed intermediate expression.

By searching databases for sequences similar to the CARD domain of APAF1
(602233), followed by PCR, Pathan et al. (2001) cloned CARD8, which they
designated TUCAN. CARD8 contains an N-terminal segment that shares 50%
amino acid identity with a region of the proapoptotic protein DEFCAP
(NALP1; 606636), as well as a C-terminal CARD domain.

By Western blot analysis of several tissues, Bouchier-Hayes et al.
(2001) found CARD8 expressed at an apparent molecular mass of 50 kD,
close to the predicted molecular mass of 49 kD. Highest expression was
in lung, ovary, testis, and placenta, with low or absent expression in
brain, skeletal muscle, and spleen.

By RT-PCR, Razmara et al. (2002) found highest CARD8 expression in
placenta, spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow.

By EST analysis, Zhang and Fu (2002) identified 5 splice variants of
CARD8, which they called NDPP1. The variants all have different
translation start sites.

Yamamoto et al. (2005) cloned a splice variant of CARD8 that they named
TUCAN54 after the calculated molecular mass of the encoded protein. The
deduced 487-amino acid TUCAN54 protein has a unique 80-amino acid N
terminus compared with the 48-kD isoform, TUCAN48, but both proteins
contain a NALP homology domain, a candidate caspase cleavage site
(DEED), a C-terminal CARD domain, and several putative phosphorylation
sites. The N terminus of TUCAN54 provides phosphorylation sites not
found in TUCAN48. RT-PCR detected high TUCAN54 expression in leukocytes
and spleen. Expression was lower in heart, lung, thymus, liver,
pancreas, and testis, and little to no expression was detected in other
tissues examined. TUCAN54 was widely expressed in a variety of tumor
cell lines.

By EST database and RT-PCR analyses, Bagnall et al. (2008) characterized
5 isoforms of CARD8 that differ in their N termini and have predicted
molecular masses of 47.5, 48, 51, 54, and 60 kD. The major 48-kD isoform
has 432 amino acids and starts in exon 5, and the 54-kD isoform has 487
amino acids and starts in exon 4. The 47.5-kD isoform differs in the
first 20 amino acids from the 48-kD isoform and results from a putative
initiation codon 20 bp upstream of exon 6. Western blot analysis of
lymphoblastoid cell lines from 6 Crohn disease (see IBD1; 266600)
patients showed a 48- or 47.5-kD band in all cell lines and an
additional band of 54 kD in only 1 cell line.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang and Fu (2002) determined that the CARD8 gene contains 14 exons and
spans more than 50 kb. The first 3 exons are noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Fu (2002) mapped the CARD8 gene
to chromosome 19q13.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By overexpression in Jurkat human T cells, Pathan et al. (2001) found
that CARD8 inhibited apoptosis and caspase activation induced by APAF1-
and CASP9 (602234)-dependent stimuli but not APAF1- and
CASP9-independent stimuli. Immunohistochemical analysis detected
elevated CARD8 immunostaining in 42 of 66 (64%) colon cancer specimens
compared with the adjacent normal tissues. Higher endogenous CARD8
immunostaining correlated with shorter patient survival.

Bouchier-Hayes et al. (2001) found that CARD8 suppressed NFKB activation
associated with overexpression of NFKB activators or with ligand-induced
stimulation of IL1 receptor (see 147810) or TNF receptor (see 191190).
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CARD8 interacted with
the regulatory subunit of the I-kappa-B kinase complex, IKK-gamma
(IKBKG; 300248). Bouchier-Hayes et al. (2001) concluded that CARD8 is a
regulator of NFKB activation in the context of proinflammatory signals.

Razmara et al. (2002) found that CARD8 mediated apoptosis.
Overexpression of CARD8 induced apoptosis in transfected breast cancer
and green monkey kidney cells. In contrast to the findings of Pathan et
al. (2001), inhibitor studies by Razmara et al. (2002) indicated that
apoptosis was induced by CARD8 via the APAF1/CASP9 apoptotic complex.
CARD8 also suppressed NFKB activation by diverse stimuli, and stable
CARD8 expression sensitized monocytes to differentiation-induced
apoptosis. Razmara et al. (2002) found that CARD8 bound CASP1 (147678)
and negatively regulated CASP1-dependent IL1B secretion in monocytes. In
addition, CARD8 bound the CASP1 inhibitors ICEBERG (605354) and
pseudo-ICE. Razmara et al. (2002) concluded that CARD8 may be an adaptor
molecule that regulates CASP1 activation, NFKB activation, and
apoptosis.

Zhang and Fu (2002) found that expression of CARD8 blocked BAX
(600040)-induced apoptosis in several human cell lines and in rat
embryonic fibroblasts. TNF-alpha-induced NFKB activation was suppressed
in a CARD8-transfected hepatoma cell line.

Agostini et al. (2004) noted that NALP1, unlike other short NALP
proteins, contains a C-terminal CARD domain that interacts with and
activates CASP5 (602665). CASP1 and CASP5 are activated when they
assemble with NALP1 and ASC (PYCARD; 606838) to form the inflammasome,
which is responsible for processing the inactive IL1B (147720) precursor
(proIL1B) to release active IL1B cytokine. Using immunoprecipitation
analysis, Agostini et al. (2004) found that CARD8, which contains
C-terminal FIIND (function to find) and CARD domains, associated with
constructs of NALP2 (609364) and NALP3 (CIAS1; 606416) lacking the
N-terminal pyrin domain and/or the C-terminal leucine-rich repeat
domain. They determined that the interaction was mediated by the FIIND
domain of CARD8 and the centrally located NACHT domain of NALP2 and
NALP3. The pyrin domain of NALP2 and NALP3, like that of NALP1,
interacted with the pyrin domain of ASC, which recruits CASP1.
Transfection experiments showed that an inflammasome could be assembled
containing ASC, CARD8, CASP1, and a short NALP, resulting in activation
of CASP1, but not CASP5, and strong processing of proIL1B.

Yamamoto et al. (2005) found that overexpression of TUCAN54 in human
cell lines inhibited pro-CASP9 activation and suppressed apoptosis
induced by staurosporin, a protein kinase inhibitor, and by etoposide, a
chemotherapeutic reagent. In contrast, suppression of TUCAN54 expression
via small interfering RNA increased etoposide-induced cell death.
TUCAN54 also inhibited CASP8 (601763) activation, thereby suppressing
FAS (TNFRSF6; 134637)-induced cell death. TUCAN48 inhibited CASP9
activation and, more weakly, CASP8 activation, but only TUCAN54
physically associated with FADD (602457). FADD constitutively associated
with pro-CASP8 in transfected cells, suggesting that TUCAN54 inhibits
pro-CASP8 activation by forming a molecular complex with FADD and
pro-CASP8.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using RNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines of Crohn disease patients,
Bagnall et al. (2008) showed that an A-to-T transversion in exon 5 of
the CARD8 gene (dbSNP rs2043211), predicted to result in a cys10-to-ter
(C10X) substitution in the 48-kD isoform of CARD8, did not affect the
47.5-kD isoform. Patients who were TT homozygous showed somewhat reduced
expression of CARD8 mRNA, but expressed a 47.5-kD protein. The authors
showed that the dbSNP rs2043211 variant had multiple outcomes including
unaffected, cys10 to ter, cys34 to ter, phe52 to ile, and phe102 to ile.
Bagnall et al. (2008) noted that the multiple isoforms and differing
consequences for a predicted stop codon polymorphism underline the
importance of detailed analysis of the effects of proposed functional
variants on gene expression.

Using a genomewide screen of Salmonella typhimurium-infected HapMap
lymphoblastoid cells from individuals of northern and western European
or Nigerian ancestry, Ko et al. (2009) identified a loss-of-function
allele of CARD8 (cys10 to ter; dbSNP rs2043211) that was associated with
increased cell death in vitro. Overexpression of alternative alleles and
RNA interference analysis supported the association. Genotyping of
individuals with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) showed a
modestly increased risk with the variant. Ko et al. (2009) proposed that
loss of CARD8 function and an increased inflammatory response may
protect against Salmonella but lead to increased inflammatory disease.

600201	TITLE *600201 AGOUTI SIGNALING PROTEIN; ASIP
;;ASP;;
AGOUTI, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; AGTI
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The study of mouse coat color genes and their interactions provides
insights into many processes relevant to human development and disease.
The agouti gene on mouse chromosome 2 encodes a paracrine signaling
molecule that causes hair follicle melanocytes to synthesize
pheomelanin, a yellow pigment, instead of the black or brown pigment
eumelanin. Consequently, agouti mice produce hairs with a subapical
yellow band on an otherwise black or brown background when expressed
during the midportion of hair growth. The cloned mouse agouti gene
encodes a distinctive 131-amino acid protein with a consensus signal
peptide, indicating that the protein is probably secreted (Kwon et al.,
1994). It is normally expressed in neonatal skin. In most mice, agouti
is expressed at highest levels in skin and is under control of hair
cycle- and ventral-specific promoters, which together produce a
light-bellied phenotype, i.e., a combination of yellow ventral hairs and
banded dorsal hairs. In several mouse mutations, such as 'lethal yellow'
and 'viable yellow,' agouti is deregulated and expressed ectopically.
Expression throughout hair growth and in nearly every tissue of the body
produces a yellow coat and pleiotropic effects that include adult-onset
obesity, increased tumor susceptibility, and premature infertility.

Using an interspecies DNA-hybridization approach, Kwon et al. (1994)
cloned the human homolog of the mouse agouti gene. Sequence analysis
demonstrated that the coding region of the human gene is 85% identical
to that of the mouse gene and has the potential to encode a protein of
132 amino acids with a consensus signal peptide. Expression studies with
RNA from several adult human tissues showed that the gene is expressed
in adipose tissues and testis. The question of a functional role in the
regulation of lipid metabolism within the adipocyte was raised, and the
mapping to the same region as the locus for MODY1 (125850) was noted.

Using linkage groups conserved between mice and humans, Wilson et al.
(1995) cloned the human homolog of the mouse agouti gene from a human
chromosome 20 YAC known to contain S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase
(180960), located on 20cen-q13.1 and known to be closely linked to
agouti in mouse. They named the human homolog 'agouti signaling protein'
(ASP) and confirmed that it encodes a 132-amino acid protein. They
showed, furthermore, that its mRNA is expressed in testes, ovary, and
heart, and at lower levels in liver, kidney, and foreskin. As predicted
by the interactions of mouse agouti with the 'extension' gene, which
encodes the melanocyte receptor for alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone
(MC1R; 155555), expression of ASP in transgenic mice produced a yellow
coat, and expression of ASP in cell culture blocked the MC1R-stimulated
accumulation of cAMP in mouse melanoma cells. The localization of ASP on
chromosome 20cen-q13.1 relative to other 20q loci excluded it as a
candidate for the MODY1 locus, which maps to 20q12-q13.1.

MAPPING

Kwon et al. (1994) mapped the human agouti gene to chromosome 20q11.2 by
somatic cell hybrid mapping panels and fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

GENE FUNCTION

Zemel et al. (1995) examined the status of intracellular Ca(2+) in mice
carrying the dominant agouti allele, viable yellow, since intracellular
Ca(2+) is believed to play a role in mediating insulin action and
dysregulation of Ca(2+) flux is observed in diabetic animals and humans.
They showed that in mice carrying this mutation, intracellular free
calcium concentration is elevated in skeletal muscle, and the degree of
elevation is closely correlated with the degree to which the mutant
traits are expressed in individual animals. They also demonstrated that
the agouti gene product is capable of inducing increased intracellular
free calcium in cultured and freshly isolated skeletal muscle myocytes
from wildtype mice. Based on these findings, Zemel et al. (1995)
proposed that the agouti polypeptide promotes insulin resistance in
mutant animals through its ability to increase intracellular calcium
ion.

Manne et al. (1995) reviewed the mechanisms for the pleiotropic effects
of the agouti gene and discussed the implications for human disease.
Expression of the human agouti gene was detected in adipose tissue,
heart, and testis, suggesting a role in a variety of processes including
skin pigmentation, cardiovascular function, and energy metabolism. In
addition, the observation of agouti expression in premenopausal but not
postmenopausal ovaries suggested a role for the agouti protein in
fertility as well. Observations of elevated intracellular calcium ion
levels in tissues from hypertensive, obese, and diabetic patients
suggest that the agouti protein may be a common link between these
diseases. The level of expression of the agouti gene may be dictated by
a series of alleles in the human population that can predispose
individuals to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and/or diabetes.

Graham et al. (1997) stated that the ectopic expression of agouti
produces obesity by mimicking the normal action of AGRT (602311) in the
hypothalamus.

Chronic antagonism of melanocortin receptors by the paracrine-acting
agouti gene product induces both yellow fur and a maturity-onset obesity
syndrome in mice that ubiquitously express wildtype agouti. Functional
analysis of agouti mutations in transgenic mice indicate that the
cysteine-rich C terminus, signal peptide, and glycosylation site are
required for agouti activity in vivo. In contrast, no biologic activity
has been ascribed to the conserved basic domain consisting of
approximately 30 amino acids of predominantly basic residues in the
center of the protein in all mammals in which it has been studied. To
examine the functional significance of the agouti basic domain in the
mouse, Miltenberger et al. (1999) deleted the entire 29-amino acid
region from the agouti cDNA, and the resulting mutation was expressed in
transgenic mice under the control of the human beta-actin promoter.
Three independent lines of mutant transgenic mice all developed some
degree of yellow pigment in the fur, indicating that the mutant protein
was functional in vivo. However, none of the mutant transgenic mice
developed completely yellow fur, obesity, hyperinsulinism, or
hyperglycinemia. High levels of expression of the mutant protein in
relevant tissues exceeded the level of agouti expression in obese viable
yellow mice, suggesting that suboptimal activity or synthesis of the
mutant protein, rather than insufficient RNA synthesis, accounted for
the phenotype of the mutant transgenic mice. These findings indicated a
functional role for the agouti basic domain in vivo, possibly
influencing the biogenesis of secreted agouti protein or modulating
protein-protein interactions that contribute to effective antagonism of
melanocortin receptors.

Epigenetic modifications have effects on phenotype, but they are
generally considered to be cleared on passage through the germline in
mammals, so that only genetic traits are inherited. Morgan et al. (1999)
describe the inheritance of an epigenetic modification at the agouti
locus in mice. In viable yellow mice, transcription originating in an
intracisternal A particle (IAP) retrotransposon inserted upstream of the
agouti gene causes ectopic expression of agouti protein, resulting in
yellow fur, obesity, diabetes, and increased susceptibility to tumors.
The pleiotropic effects of ectopic agouti expression are presumably due
to effects of the paracrine signal on other tissues. Viable yellow mice
display variable expressivity because they are epigenetic mosaics for
activity of the retrotransposon. Isogenic viable yellow mice have coats
that vary in a continuous spectrum from full yellow through variegated
yellow/agouti to full agouti (pseudoagouti). The distribution of
phenotypes among offspring is related to the phenotype of the dam, and
when a viable yellow dam has the agouti phenotype, her offspring are
more likely to be agouti. Morgan et al. (1999) demonstrated that this
maternal epigenetic effect is not the result of a maternally contributed
environment. By using an alternative combination of genetic and
embryo-transfer experiments, Morgan et al. (1999) found that the
nonrandom distribution of coat color results from an incomplete erasure
of an epigenetic modification when a silenced viable yellow allele is
passed through the female germline, with consequent inheritance of the
epigenetic modification. Morgan et al. (1999) suggested that since
retrotransposons are abundant in mammalian genomes, this type of
inheritance may be common.

In mouse follicular melanocytes, production of eumelanins and
pheomelanins is under the control of 2 intercellular signaling molecules
that exert opposite actions: alpha-MSH (see 176830), which
preferentially increases the synthesis of eumelanins, and ASP, whose
expression favors the production of hair containing pheomelanins.
Aberdam et al. (1998) reported that ASP not only affects mature
melanocytes but can also inhibit the differentiation of melanoblasts.
They showed that both alpha-MSH and forskolin promote the
differentiation of murine melanoblasts into mature melanocytes, and that
ASP inhibits this process. Expression of MITF (156845) and its binding
to an M-box regulatory element is inhibited by ASP. Aberdam et al.
(1998) also showed that in a murine melanoma cell line, ASP inhibits
alpha-MSH-stimulated expression of tyrosinase (see 606933), TYRP1
(115501), and TYRP2 (191275) through an inhibition of the
transcriptional activity of their respective promoters. Further, ASP
inhibits alpha-MSH-induced expression of the MITF gene and reduces the
level of MITF in the cells. Aberdam et al. (1998) concluded that ASP can
regulate both melanoblast differentiation and melanogenesis, pointing
out the key role of MITF in the control of these processes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In mice and humans, binding of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone to
the melanocyte-stimulating-hormone receptor (MSHR), the protein product
of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R; 155555) gene, leads to the
synthesis of eumelanin. In the mouse, ligation of MSHR by ASP results in
the production of pheomelanin. The binding of ASP to MSHR precludes
alpha-MSH-initiated signaling and thus blocks production of cAMP,
leading to a downregulation of eumelanogenesis. The net result is
increased synthesis of pheomelanin. Kanetsky et al. (2002) undertook to
characterize the ASIP gene in a group of white subjects to assess
whether ASIP was a determinant of human pigmentation and whether this
gene is associated with increased melanoma risk. They found no evidence
of coding region sequence variation in ASIP, but detected an 8818A-G
polymorphism in the 3-prime untranslated region (dbSNP rs6058017;
600201.0001). They genotyped 746 participants in a study of melanoma
susceptibility for this polymorphism. Among 147 healthy controls, the
frequency of the G allele was 0.12. Carriage of the G allele was
significantly associated with dark hair (odds ratio 1.8) and brown eyes
(odds ratio 1.9) after adjusting for age, gender, and disease status.
This was said to be the first report of an association of ASIP with
specific human pigmentation characteristics. It remained to be
investigated whether the interaction of MC1R and ASIP can enhance
prediction of human pigmentation and melanoma risk.

In a large genomewide association study of human pigmentation
characteristics among 5,130 Icelanders, with follow-up analyses in 2,116
Icelanders and 1,214 Dutch individuals, Sulem et al. (2008) found strong
association of an extended haplotype tagged by a 2-SNP haplotype, dbSNP
rs1015362G and dbSNP rs4911414T, with red hair color, freckling, and
skin sensitivity to sun, in addition to burning and freckling. The
association was stronger than that found for dbSNP rs6058017, and after
adjustment for the ASIP haplotype, dbSNP rs6058017 was only marginally
associated with pigmentation characteristics. The SNPs dbSNP rs1015362
and dbSNP rs4911414 lie outside the ASIP gene itself.

Gudbjartsson et al. (2008) found association of the ASIP haplotype of
Sulem et al. (2008) with susceptibility to cutaneous malignant melanoma
and basal cell carcinoma (see CMM7, 612263).

EVOLUTION

Linnen et al. (2009) studied cryptically colored deer mice living on the
Nebraska Sand Hills, a dune field with soil mostly consisting of quartz
grains that are lighter in color than the surrounding soils. The authors
showed that the light coloration of these mice stems from a novel
banding pattern on individual hairs produced by an increase in Agouti
expression. This increase is caused by a cis-acting mutation (or
mutations), which either is or is closely linked to a single amino acid
deletion in Agouti that appears to be under selection. Linnen et al.
(2009) noted that their data suggests that this derived Agouti allele
arose de novo after the formation of the Sand Hills, which date to
between 8,000 to 15,000 years ago. Linnen et al. (2009) concluded that
their findings revealed one means by which genetic, developmental, and
evolutionary mechanisms can drive rapid adaptation under ecologic
pressure.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice that carry the lethal yellow or viable yellow mutation, 2 dominant
mutations of the agouti gene on mouse chromosome 2, exhibit a phenotype
that includes yellow fur, marked obesity, a form of type II diabetes
associated with insulin resistance, and an increased susceptibility to
tumor development. Klebig et al. (1995) generated transgenic mice that
ectopically expressed an agouti cDNA clone encoding the normal agouti
protein in all tissues examined. Transgenic mice of both sexes had
yellow fur, became obese, and developed hyperinsulinemia. In addition,
male transgenic mice developed hyperglycemia by 12 to 20 weeks of age.
The results demonstrated that the ectopic agouti expression is
responsible for most, if not all, of the phenotypic traits of the
dominant, 'obese yellow' mutants.

Eizirik et al. (2003) studied the molecular genetics and evolution of
melanism in the cat family. Melanistic coat coloration occurs as a
common polymorphism in 11 of 37 felid species and reaches high
population frequency in some cases but never achieves complete fixation.
Eizirik et al. (2003) mapped, cloned, and sequenced the cat homologs of
2 putative candidate genes for melanism, ASIP (agouti) and
melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R; 155555), and identified 3 independent
deletions associated with dark coloration in 3 different felid species.
Association and transmission analyses showed that a 2-bp deletion in the
ASIP gene specifies black coloration in domestic cats, and 2 different
in-frame deletions in the MC1R gene are implicated in melanism in
jaguars and jaguarundis. Melanistic individuals from 5 other felid
species did not carry any of these mutations, implying that there are at
least 4 independent genetic origins for melanism in the cat family. The
inferred multiple origins and independent historical elevation in
population frequency of felid melanistic mutations suggested the
occurrence of adaptive evolution of this visible phenotype in a group of
related free-ranging species.

Drogemuller et al. (2006) identified a mutation in the noncoding region
of the Asip gene as the cause of black-and-tan coat pigmentation in
Mangalitza pigs.

The agouti-yellow (Ay) deletion is the only genetic modifier known to
suppress testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT; 273300) susceptibility in
mice or human. The Ay mutation deletes Raly and Eif2s2 (603908) and
induces the ectopic expression of agouti, all of which are potential
TGCT-modifying mutations. Heaney et al. (2009) reported that the reduced
TGCT incidence of heterozygous Ay male mice and the recessive embryonic
lethality of Ay are caused by the deletion of Eif2s2. The incidence of
affected males was reduced 2-fold in mice that were partially deficient
for Eif2s2 and that embryonic lethality occurred near the time of
implantation in mice that were fully deficient for Eif2s2. In contrast,
neither reduced expression of Raly in gene-trap mice nor ectopic
expression of agouti in transgenic or viable-yellow (Avy) mutants
affected TGCT incidence or embryonic viability. Partial deficiency of
Eif2s2 attenuated germ cell proliferation and differentiation, both of
which are important to TGCT formation. Heaney et al. (2009) concluded
that germ cell development and TGCT pathogenesis are sensitive to the
availability of the eIF2 translation initiation complex and to changes
in the rate of translation.

See melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R; 155541) for further discussion of
models for mouse obesity involving agouti.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 9, DARK/LIGHT HAIR
SKIN/HAIR/EYE PIGMENTATION 9, BROWN/NONBROWN EYES, INCLUDED
ASIP, 8818A-G

By PCR and direct sequencing of the ASIP gene in 105 healthy control
subjects, Kanetsky et al. (2002) identified a polymorphism in the
3-prime untranslated region of the ASIP gene, 8818A-G (dbSNP rs6058017),
25 bp downstream of the termination codon in exon 4. They genotyped 147
healthy controls, 176 patients with dysplastic nevi, and 423 patients
with melanoma (155600) for the 8818A-G polymorphism. Carriage of the G
allele was significantly associated with having dark hair (OR = 1.8; 95%
CI 1.2-2.8) and brown eyes (OR = 1.9; 95% CI 1.3-2.7) (SHEP9; 611742).
An allele dosage effect such that homozygous carriers had an increased
likelihood of having dark hair and brown eyes compared to heterozygous
carriers was indicated.

Sulem et al. (2008) found that after adjustment for a 2-SNP haplotype
near, but not within, the ASIP gene, dbSNP rs6058017 was only marginally
associated with pigmentation characteristics.

614141	TITLE *614141 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; TRIM2
;;KIAA0517
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRIM2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that directs
proteasome-mediated degradation of target proteins (Balastik et al.,
2008; Thompson et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned TRIM2, which they designated
KIAA0517. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
end. The deduced 792-amino acid protein had an apparent molecular mass
of 84 kD by SDS-PAGE. It shares weak similarity with mouse Tif1 (TRIM24;
603406). RT-PCR detected highest TRIM2 expression in human kidney,
followed by brain, ovary, and small intestine, with little to no
expression detected in other tissues examined.

Reymond et al. (2001) cloned mouse Trim2. The deduced protein contains
an N-terminal RING domain, followed by a B-box-2 domain, a coiled-coil
region, and 6 C-terminal NHL repeats. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected a 7.5-kb transcript in adult brain, kidney, pancreas,
and spleen. RNA in situ hybridization of embryonic mouse revealed
expression in central nervous system, gut, retina, lung, and kidney.
Mouse Trim2 was expressed in a filamentous cytoplasmic pattern in
transfected human cells.

Using in situ hybridization and histochemical staining of mouse nervous
system, Balastik et al. (2008) detected Trim2 expression in Purkinje
cells and deep nuclei of cerebellum; in ganglionic cell layer, inner
nuclear layer, and outer plexiform layer of retina; in pyramidal cells
of CA1 to CA3 hippocampal areas; in granule cells of dentate gyrus; and
in stratum radiatum. Trim2 was also expressed in spinal cord, dorsal
root ganglia, hindbrain, and midbrain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro-translated proteins, Balastik et al. (2008) showed that
mouse Trim2 functioned as a ubiquitin ligase, using Ubch5a (UBE2D1;
602961) as a ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme in an autoubiquitination
reaction. Trim2 interacted with Nfl (NEFL; 162280) from mouse brain
lysates, and deletion of the NHL repeats of Trim2 abolished the
interaction. A ligase-dead Trim2 mutant had a dominant-negative effect
on Nfl ubiquitination.

A brief period of ischemia is accompanied by phosphorylation,
ubiquitination, and degradation of the cell death-promoting protein BIM
(BCL2L11; 603827), and this response protects neurons from subsequent
harmful ischemic challenge. Using primary rat cortical neurons subjected
to oxygen and glucose deprivation to model ischemia, Thompson et al.
(2011) identified Trim2 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase that promoted
ubiquitination and degradation of Bim following a preconditioning
ischemic episode. Human TRIM2 interacted with Bim in a cell-free
expression system, and the interaction depended upon p42 (MAPK1;
176948)/p44 (MAPK3; 601795)-mediated Bim serine phosphorylation.
Preconditioning-induced Bim degradation was blocked by proteasome
inhibition or knockdown of Trim2 via small hairpin RNA or
immunodepletion. Thompson et al. (2011) concluded that TRIM2 controls
the apoptotic response to ischemia by directing degradation of BIM
protein.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the TRIM2
gene to chromosome 4. Reymond et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM2 gene to
chromosome 4q27-q34 by radiation hybrid analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Finnish girl with autosomal recessive early-onset
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2R (CMT2R; 615490), Ylikallio et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the TRIM2 gene
(614141.0001 and 614141.0002). The mutations were found by whole-exome
sequencing and segregated with the disorder in the family. The patient
had onset in early childhood of muscle weakness and atrophy affecting
the upper and lower distal extremities. She showed delayed onset of
walking and walked with a broad-based gait. She also had areflexia, pes
cavus, and decreased motor nerve conduction velocities. Sural nerve
biopsy was consistent with nonspecific axonal degeneration, and axons
showed abnormal accumulation of neurofilaments. Study of patient
fibroblasts showed significant deficiency of the TRIM2 protein,
consistent with a loss of function. Ylikallio et al. (2013) noted that
the neurofilament light chain is a ubiquitination target of TRIM2, and
suggested that abnormal axonal accumulation of neurofilaments underlies
the disorder. In addition, Trim2-null mice show a gait ataxia and
neurodegeneration accompanied by axonal swelling and development of
neurofilament aggregates, suggestive of impaired axonal transport. No
TRIM2 mutations were identified in a cohort of 87 patients with
early-onset CMT, indicating that mutations in this gene are a rare cause
of the disorder.

ANIMAL MODEL

Balastik et al. (2008) found that Trim -/- mice were indistinguishable
from wildtype and heterozygous littermates until about 1.5 months of
age, when they began to show intention tremor, followed by gait ataxia.
In later stages, Trim -/- mice suffered from episodes of spontaneous
generalized seizures. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed substantial
and progressive loss of Purkinje cells beginning at about postnatal day
50, with 85% loss of Purkinje cells by 5 months of age. Deep cerebellar
nuclei showed a similar progressive neurodegeneration. Caspase-3 (CASP3;
600636) immunoreactivity suggested that loss of Purkinje cells was due
to apoptosis. At 4 months of age, retinas of Trim -/- mice showed
reductions in inner nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, and ganglionic
cells, whereas the photoreceptor layer was not altered.
Neurodegeneration in Trim2 -/- mice was accompanied by axonal swelling
and development of Nfl aggregates, suggestive of impaired axonal
transport.

CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2R (1 family)
TRIM2, GLU227VAL

In an 18-year-old Finnish girl with autosomal recessive early-onset
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2R (CMT2R; 615490), Ylikallio et al.
(2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the TRIM2 gene: a
c.680A-T transversion, resulting in a glu227-to-val (E227V) substitution
at a highly conserved residue in the coiled-coil domain, and a 1-bp
deletion (c.1699delA; 614141.0002), resulting in a frameshift and
premature termination (Lys567ArgfsTer7). The mutations were found by
whole-exome sequencing and segregated with the disorder in the family.
Neither were present in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes databases or in 366
Finnish control chromosomes. Studies of patient fibroblasts showed that
the c.1699delA mutant transcript underwent nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,
and that there were low levels of the E227V mutant protein, indicating
that it is unstable. Transfection of the E227V mutation into HEK293
cells confirmed reduced stability of the mutant protein. The findings
were consistent with a loss of TRIM2 function.

;;SMOOTH MUSCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; SMAP8;;
KIAA1180
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Hirosawa et al. (1999) cloned NDRG4. The deduced protein
contains 273 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in
adult and fetal brain and adult heart, followed by lung and testis.
Lower expression was detected in other adult tissues examined, but
little to no expression was detected in fetal liver. High NDRG4
expression was detected in all specific adult brain regions examined,
with highest expression in amygdala, cerebellum, and thalamus.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NDRG1 (605262),
followed by 3-prime and 5-prime RACE of human brain and heart cDNA
libraries and cap-site hunting, Zhou et al. (2001) cloned 3 splice
variants of NDRG4. The variants NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var, which were
obtained from the brain library, encode deduced proteins of 339 and 352
amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 37.1 and 38.5 kD,
respectively. Compared with NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var has a 14-amino acid
insertion near the C terminus. The variant NDRG4H, which was obtained
from the heart library, encodes a deduced 371-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 40.6 kD. NDRG4H differs from NDRG4B and
NDRG4B-var at its N-terminal end, and it lacks the 14-amino acid
insertion. Northern blot analysis detected NDRG4 transcripts of about
3.2 kb in brain and heart only. Variant-specific probes showed NDRG4B
expression in brain only, whereas NDRG4H was expressed in both brain and
heart, with higher expression in heart. RT-PCR confirmed expression of
all 3 variants in brain and of NDRG4H in heart. RNA dot-blot analysis
revealed NDRG4 expression in spinal cord, all specific brain regions
examined, and all specific heart regions examined except aorta.
Expression was also detected in spleen, lymph node, testis, adrenal
gland, and fetal brain and heart, but not in other tissues examined. In
situ hybridization of normal adult brain detected NDRG4 mRNA in
cytoplasm of neurons in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, mesencephalon,
pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. No signal was detected in
peripheral nerves or other cell types, such as glial cells. Western blot
analysis of endogenous or exogenously expressed proteins showed that
NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H had apparent molecular masses of 37, 39,
and 41 kD, respectively.

Using expression profiling to identify genes expressed in aortic smooth
muscle, followed by screening a heart cDNA library, Nishimoto et al.
(2003) cloned NDRG4, which they called SMAP8. The deduced 371-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 40.7 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected high expression of an approximately 3.3-kb transcript
in heart and brain, with little to no expression in other tissues
examined. PCR analysis showed moderate expression in aorta and vascular
smooth muscle cells. Western blot analysis of heart and brain detected
SMAP8 at an apparent molecular mass of about 45 kD. SMAP8 localized to
the cytoplasmic fraction of transfected A10 embryonic rat aortic smooth
muscle cells.

By in situ hybridization of adult mouse brain, Yamamoto et al. (2011)
detected wide distribution of Ndrg4 in neurons, but not in astrocytes.
Western blot analysis of adult mouse brain detected 3 Ndrg4 isoforms
representing orthologs of human NDRG4B, NDRG4B-var, and NDRG4H.

GENE FUNCTION

Nishimoto et al. (2003) showed that homocysteine upregulated SMAP8
expression in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells and rat A10
cells, but not in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Proliferation
and migration of A10 cells significantly decreased following expression
of human SMAP8. SMAP8 was phosphorylated by a serine/threonine kinase
via activation of a PDGF (see 173430) signaling pathway. In addition,
ERK1 (MAPK3; 601795)/ERK2 (MAPK1; 176948) and MEK1 (MAP2K1; 176872)/MEK2
(MAP2K2; 601263) were activated in SMAP8-transfected A10 cells.

Hongo et al. (2006) found that overexpression of 1 of the 6 isoforms of
rat Ndrg4, Ndrg4c2, in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells reduced NGF (see
162030)-induced phosphorylation of Elk1 (311040), a nuclear target of
Erk. Reporter gene assays revealed that Ndrg4c2 suppressed Elk1-mediated
activation of a serum response element.

By RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis, Schilling et al. (2009)
found that NDRG4 expression was increased in glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM; see 137800) compared with normal human astrocytes. Knockdown of
NDRG4 via short hairpin RNA reduced the viability of GBM cells via G1
cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Knockdown of NDRG4 also
reduced the viability of several GBM cell lines and primary astrocytes.
Knockdown of NDRG4 in GBM tumor xenografts reduced tumor growth
following intracranial injection in immunocompromised mice.
Overexpression of NDRG4B or NDRG4H did not affect cell viability.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhou et al. (2001) determined that the NDRG4 gene contains 17 exons and
spans 26 kb. Exons 1 and 2 are specific for NDRG4H, exon 3 is specific
for NDRG4B and NDGR4B-var, and exon 16 is specific for NDRG4B-var. The
region upstream of exon 1 contains a GGCG sequence that may represent a
TATA-less promoter for NDRG4H expression. The region upstream of exon 3
contains a consensus TATA box and 2 CCAAT sequences and may represent
the promoter for NDRG4B and NDRG4B-var expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhou et al. (2001) mapped the NDRG4 gene
to chromosome 16q21-q22.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamamoto et al. (2011) found that Ndrg4 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio, appeared normal, and were fertile. However,
Ndrg4 -/- mice showed deficits in spatial learning and memory, and they
exhibited increased sensitivity to ischemic stress following middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Consistent with these findings, Ndrg4 -/-
mice had reduced expression of the neuroprotective factor Bdnf (113505).

;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 17; LEP17
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE3E,
which they called LEP17. RT-PCR detected LEP17 in human skin, esophagus,
and heart.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected very low LCE3E
expression in adult and fetal skin. Low LCE3E expression was also
detected in internal epithelia, including vulva, tongue, and esophagus.

GENE FUNCTION

Jackson et al. (2005) showed that expression of LCE3E was upregulated in
cultured normal human keratinocytes by ultraviolet radiation. At 48
hours after irradiation, the level of LCE3E was upregulated over
350-fold compared with mock-irradiated controls. LCE3E expression was
not regulated by calcium.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that LCE3E is a single-exon gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE3E
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) determined that the LCE3E gene lies within intron 1 of the LCE3C
gene (612615) and is oriented in the opposite direction. They stated
that the mouse Lce3e gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene cluster on
chromosome 3F1.

HEART MUSCLE PROTEIN; HMP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The heart muscle protein gene is expressed predominantly in the heart
and is proposed to be an ATP-driven motor protein that interacts with
cytoskeletal components. Icho et al. (1994) cloned a full-length 2.7-kb
cDNA coding for a 758-amino acid protein. The protein has a possible
ATP-binding domain at the N terminus and a long alpha-helical domain
that could form a coiled-coil structure. Proteins with similar
structures include myosin II (see 160730), an actin-based motor protein,
and kinesin (see 602809), a microtubule-based motor protein.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the IMMT
gene to chromosome 2p11.2 (TMAP G62066).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Serine proteases are endopeptidases that are involved in multiple
biologic processes, including proteolytic processing of proteins,
digestion, blood coagulation, immune response, and development.
Trypsin-like serine proteases (EC 3.4.21.4), such as PRSS3, catalyze the
hydrolysis of peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of lysine or arginine
residues (summary by Wiegand et al., 1993).

CLONING

Using a porcine trypsinogen cDNA probe to screen a human pancreas cDNA
library, Tani et al. (1990) cloned PRSS3, which they called trypsinogen
III. The deduced 247-amino acid protein has N-terminal signal and
activation processing sites and shares 85.0% and 86.6% identity with
trypsinogen I (PRSS1; 276000) and trypsinogen II (PRSS2; 601564),
respectively.

Using degenerate primers to amplify cDNAs encoding serine proteases from
total human brain mRNA, followed by screening genomic DNA for a 5-prime
fragment, Wiegand et al. (1993) cloned a PRSS3 splice variant that they
called trypsinogen IV. Trypsinogen IV differs from trypsinogen III (Tani
et al., 1990) only in the first exon. The deduced 304-amino acid protein
has characteristics of a serine protease, including a conserved
his-asp-ser catalytic triad and residues involved in substrate
recognition. PCR of brain and pancreas revealed tissue-specific
expression of the 2 PRSS3 variants.

Nyaruhucha et al. (1997) cloned PRSS3, which they called
mesotrypsinogen, from a pancreas cDNA library. The deduced protein
contains 247 amino acids.

GENE FUNCTION

Using purified human protein expressed in E. coli, Nyaruhucha et al.
(1997) showed that mesotrypsinogen cleaved a synthetic trypsin
substrate, but only following activation by enterokinase (PRSS7;
606635). Recombinant mesotrypsin showed resistance to proteinaceous
inhibitors and sensitivity to small pharmacologic serine protease
inhibitors, similar to purified human mesotrypsin. Significantly,
mesotrypsin was resistant to inhibition by soybean trypsin inhibitor
(SBTI) and the physiologic pancreatic serine protease inhibitor PSTI
(SPINK1; 167790).

Szmola et al. (2003) found that mesotrypsin did not autoactivate and did
not activate other pancreatic zymogens. They noted that mesotrypsin
contains arg198 in place of the signature gly198 found in
chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. Mutation of arg198 to gly partially
restored the ability of mesotrypsin to activate pancreatic zymogens and
restored its binding and sensitivity to the protein trypsin inhibitors
SBTI and SPINK1. Szmola et al. (2003) noted that in complexes of
proteases and canonical protease inhibitors, the reactive-site peptide
bond of the inhibitor is slowly cleaved. On the contrary, mesotrypsin
rapidly cleaved and deactivated SBTI and SPINK1. Szmola et al. (2003)
concluded that mesotrypsin has a role in degrading trypsin inhibitors
and suggested that it may function in digestion of foods high in
naturally occurring trypsin inhibitors.

Two of the 3 isoforms of amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760) are
ubiquitously expressed and contain a 56-residue Kunitz-type serine
protease inhibitor domain. Secreted APP containing the Kunitz domain is
called protease nexin-2 and potently inhibits serine proteases. Using an
affinity-based proteomic screen, Salameh et al. (2010) showed that
mesotrypsin bound protease nexin-2. Mesotrypsin efficiently cleaved
protease nexin-2 and thereby compromised its ability to inhibit other
serine proteases.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wiegand et al. (1993) reported that the PRSS3 gene contains 6 coding
exons, including 2 alternate first exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rowen et al. (1996) mapped the PRSS3 gene,
which they called T9, to chromosome 9p13. They found that this region of
chromosome 9, which also contains the PRSS1 and PRSS2 genes and several
trypsinogen pseudogenes, arose via a translocation event from chromosome
7q35.

606195	TITLE *606195 IROQUOIS HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 5; IRX5
;;IRXB2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IRX5 is a member of the Iroquois homeobox gene family. Members of this
family appear to play multiple roles during pattern formation of
vertebrate embryos.

CLONING

Members of the Iroquois complex in Drosophila, including the highly
homologous homeobox genes caupolican, araucan, and mirror, act as
prepattern molecules in neurogenesis. Bosse et al. (1997) identified 3
members of the Iroquois homeobox gene family in mouse and showed that
they are involved in several embryonic developmental processes including
anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral patterning of specific regions of
the central nervous system, and regionalization of the otic vesicle,
branchial epithelium, and limbs.

By EST database searching, Lewis et al. (1999) identified a human
breast-derived partial cDNA clone containing a novel homeobox. Using
oligonucleotide primers designed to this clone for RACE/PCR, they
obtained the full-length cDNA, which they designated IRX2 but which was
later designated IRX5, as well as fragments of transcripts derived from
4 additional IRX genes. The human IRX homeodomains are about 90%
identical to the homeodomains of the Drosophila Iroquois complex
proteins and about 93% identical to each other. Each of the IRX proteins
contains a hexapeptide-like motif. Lewis et al. (1999) found that the
deduced 417-amino acid IRX5 protein also contains acidic and polyproline
regions and an IRO box. Northern blot analysis detected 2 main
transcripts of 2.6 and 3.9 kb, but the larger transcript did not appear
to contain a closely related homeobox. IRX5 expression is not
breast-specific, as it was found to be weakly expressed in adult human
lung, uterus, salivary gland, and kidney. In situ hybridization
demonstrated that IRX5 is differentially expressed in major mammary
epithelial cell lineages and that its expression is further regulated
during both the proliferative and cyclical phases of human breast
development. IRX5 expression is maintained in human mammary neoplasias.

GENE FUNCTION

Through in vivo modeling in Xenopus laevis embryos, Bonnard et al.
(2012) demonstrated that Irx5 modulates the migration of progenitor cell
populations in branchial arches and gonads by repressing Sdf1 (CXCL12;
600835). They also found that transcriptional control by Irx5 is
modulated by direct protein-protein interaction with GATA3 (131320) and
TRPS1 (604386). Bonnard et al. (2012) suggested that IRX proteins
integrate combinatorial transcriptional inputs to regulate key signaling
molecules involved in the ontogeny of multiple organs during
embryogenesis and homeostasis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 5 affected individuals from 2 consanguineous families with an
autosomal recessive craniofacial syndrome mapping to chromosome
16q12.2-q21 (611174), Bonnard et al. (2012) screened 73 candidate genes
and identified 2 homozygous missense mutations in the IRX5 gene
(606195.0001 and 606195.0002) that segregated with disease in each
family. Irx5 knockdown by morpholino injection in X. laevis embryos
recapitulated the blood, heart, germ cell, and craniofacial anomalies
seen in patients with IRX5 mutations. In addition, Bonnard et al. (2012)
found that IRX5 has direct protein-protein interactions with GATA3 and
TRPS1, and noted that disruption of the latter proteins causes syndromes
with overlapping features (see hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural
deafness, and renal disease, 131320, and trichorhinophalangeal syndrome,
190350, respectively).

MAPPING

By screening of a human genomic library with chicken IRX2 cDNA and EST
database searching, Ogura et al. (2001) cloned 4 human IRX genes. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, they mapped the IRX5 and IRX7
(606196) genes to chromosome 16q11.2-q13 and the IRX1 (606197) and IRX2
(606198) genes to chromosome 5p15.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Costantini et al. (2005) found that homozygous Ire5-knockout mice were
viable and fertile but had a defect in the differentiation of retinal
cone bipolar cells and were slightly smaller than wildtype.
Electrocardiograms revealed a significantly decreased signal amplitude
during ventricular repolarization. Lack of the cardiac repolarization
gradient was due to increased Kv4.2 (KCND2; 605410) in endocardial
myocardium, resulting in a selective increase of the transient outward
current, which is the major cardiac repolarization current, and in an
increased susceptibility to arrhythmias. Myocardial Irx5 was expressed
in a gradient opposite that of Kcnd2, and Irx5 repressed Kcnd2
expression by recruiting Bop (SMYD1; 606846), a cardiac transcriptional
repressor. Costantini et al. (2005) concluded that an IRX5 repressor
gradient negatively regulates potassium channel gene expression in the
heart and ensures coordinated cardiac repolarization.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HAMAMY SYNDROME
IRX5, ASN166LYS

In 3 sibs from a consanguineous Jordanian family, originally described
by Hamamy et al. (2007), with severe hypertelorism, midface prominence,
myopia, mental retardation, and bone fragility (611174), Bonnard et al.
(2012) identified homozygosity for a 498C-A transversion in the IRX5
gene, resulting in an asn166-to-lys (N166K) substitution at a
phylogenetically invariant residue in the third helix of the
homeodomain. Functional analysis demonstrated altered protein stability
and DNA binding activity, suggesting that the N166K mutation may act as
a hypomorphic rather than null allele.

.0002
HAMAMY SYNDROME
IRX5, ALA150PRO

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous Turkish family with severe
hypertelorism, midface prominence, myopia, mental retardation, and bone
fragility (611174), Bonnard et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a
448G-C transition in the IRX5 gene, resulting in an ala150-to-pro
(A150P) substitution at a phylogenetically invariant residue in the
second helix of the homeodomain. The mutation segregated with disease in
the family. X. laevis embryos with Irx5 knockdown showed defective
cranial neural crest cell migration that could be rescued with wildtype
mouse Irx5 DNA but not A150P Irx5 DNA. The A150P variant was also
unstable in X. laevis embryos compared to wildtype or N166K
(606195.0001); Bonnard et al. (2012) suggested that the A150P mutation
may act as a hypomorphic rather than null allele.

606246	TITLE *606246 JUXTAPOSED WITH ANOTHER ZINC FINGER GENE 1; JAZF1
;;TAK1-INTERACTING PROTEIN 27; TIP27
JAZF1/JJAZ1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A variety of cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosome 7 have been
reported in endometrial stromal sarcomas, including a recurrent
t(7;17)(p15;q21). In cases with this particular translocation, Koontz et
al. (2001) identified 2 zinc finger genes, which they termed JAZF1 and
JJAZ1 (606245), at the sites of the 7p15 and 17q21 breakpoints,
respectively. They obtained a JAZF1 cDNA by database analysis and
screening human brain and umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA
libraries. The deduced 243-amino acid protein has an N-terminal zinc
finger domain and a nearly tandem pair of zinc finger domains close to
the C terminus.

Using the hinge and ligand-binding domains of TAK1 (NR2C2; 601426) as
bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a testis cDNA library, Nakajima et
al. (2004) cloned human JAZF1, which they called TIP27. The deduced
243-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 27.1 kD. It
has a putative zinc finger motif near the N terminus, followed by a TAK1
interaction domain, a glu/asp-rich stretch, and 2 additional zinc finger
motifs. The second zinc finger contains a putative nuclear localization
signal. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a 3.2-kb
TIP27 transcript in all 10 human tissues examined, with highest
expression in testis, followed by colon, ovary, prostate, and placenta.
Expression was lowest in pancreas, brain, and liver. A 0.9-kb TIP27
transcript was also detected in testis. In situ hybridization of testis
revealed expression of TIP27 in pachytene spermatocytes and round
spermatids. Fluorescence-tagged TIP27 colocalized with TAK1 in a
punctate pattern in transfected COS-1 cell nuclei, and both proteins
were excluded from nucleoli. Database analysis revealed orthologs of
TIP27 in mouse and Drosophila.

GENE FUNCTION

Using mammalian 2-hybrid analysis, Nakajima et al. (2004) showed that
TIP27 interacted with TAK1, but not with other nuclear receptors, either
in the presence or absence of their respective ligands. Protein
pull-down and immunoprecipitation analyses confirmed the interaction
between TIP27 and TAK1. Deletion analysis revealed that an N-terminal
domain of TIP27 interacted with a portion of the ligand-binding domain
of TAK1. Mutation analysis showed that tyr60 of TIP27 was crucial for
the interaction. Reporter gene assays revealed that TIP27 repressed TIP1
transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. TIP27 did not
interfere with TIP1 homodimerization or with binding of TIP1 to DNA,
suggesting that interaction of TIP27 with TAK1 may inhibit recruitment
of a coactivator.

- JAZF1/JJAZ1 Fusion Protein

Koontz et al. (2001) determined that the recurrent t(7;17)(p15;q21) in
endometrial stromal sarcomas fuses the JAZF1 and JJAZ1 genes, resulting
in a chimeric transcript containing the 5-prime end of JAZF1 and the
3-prime end of JJAZ1. Analysis of tumor RNA indicated that a JAZF1/JJAZ1
fusion was present in all types of endometrial stromal tumors; however,
the fusion appeared to be rarer among endometrial stromal sarcomas that
would be considered high-grade according to certain classification
schemes. These findings suggested that the less malignant endometrial
stromal tumors may evolve toward more malignant types, but that some
endometrial stromal sarcomas with relatively abundant mitotic activity
may compose a biologically distinct group.

Li et al. (2007) stated that the first 3 exons of JAZF1 are joined to
the last 15 exons of JJAZ1 in the JAZF1/JJAZ1 fusion transcript. They
found that both benign and malignant forms of endometrial stromal tumors
had the JAZF1/JJAZ1 fusion, but only the malignant form also exhibited
suppression of the unrearranged JJAZ1 allele. Li et al. (2007) found
that suppression of endogenous JJAZ1 in human embryonic kidney cells
reduced the amounts of EZH2 (601573) and total histone-3 (see 602810)
lys27 trimethylation. Introduction of the JAZF1/JJAZ1 chimeric
transcript into the JJAZ1-depleted cells reversed these effects.
Suppression of JJAZ1 also reduced cell proliferation, whereas
JAZF1/JJAZ1 induced above normal proliferation in JJAZ1-depleted cells.
However, in the presence of normal JJAZ1 levels, JAZF1/JJAZ1 decreased
cell proliferation. Expression of JJAZF1/JJAZ1 with or without
suppression of JJAZ1 protected cells from apoptosis caused by serum
deprivation or hypoxia. Li et al. (2007) concluded that progression of a
benign precursor to a sarcoma involves increased cell survival
associated with rearrangement of a Polycomb group gene, such as JJAZ1,
followed by accelerated cellular proliferation upon exclusion of the
unrearranged allele of that gene.

Li et al. (2008) showed that normal endometrial stromal cells contain a
specific chimeric RNA joining 5-prime exons of the JAZF1 gene on
chromosome 7p15 to 3-prime exons of the Polycomb group gene JJAZ1
(606245) on chromosome 17q11 and that this RNA is translated into
JAZF1/JJAZ1, a protein with antiapoptotic activity. The JAZF1/JJAZ1 RNA
appears to arise from physiologically regulated trans-splicing between
precursor mRNAs for JAZF1 and JJAZ1. The chimeric RNA and protein are
identical to those produced from a gene fusion found in human
endometrial stromal tumors. Li et al. (2008) concluded that certain gene
fusions may be proneoplastic owing to constitutive expression of
chimeric gene products normally generated by trans-splicing of RNAs in
developing tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Li et al. (2007) stated that the JAZF1 gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Koontz et al. (2001) mapped the JAZF1 gene
to chromosome 7p15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large genomewide association study of prostate cancer, Thomas et
al. (2008) found association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
in the second intron of the JAZF1 gene, dbSNP rs10486567, with prostate
cancer risk (P = 2.14 x 10(-6)).

For a discussion of an association between variation in the JAZF1 gene
and stature, see STQTL17 (612737).

;;CHARGED AMINO ACID-RICH LEUCINE ZIPPER 1; CRL1; CRLZ1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sakuma et al. (2001) cloned mouse Utp3, which they called Crl1. The
deduced 469-amino acid protein is rich in charged amino acids and
contains a putative leucine zipper region and a region that shares
significant homology with yeast Sas10. In situ hybridization revealed
expression in olfactory bulb and cerebral cortex in mouse embryos at
17.5 days postcoitum. Postnatally, Crl1 expression was also observed in
cerebellar cortex, with strong expression in hippocampus.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Sakuma et al. (2001) showed that mouse Crl1
interacted specifically with Pebp2b2, which is encoded by a splice
variant of Pebp2b (CBFB; 121360).

Lim et al. (2006) showed that the CRLZ1 and IgJ (147790) genes are
adjacent but divergently transcribed in human and mouse. By chromatin
immunoprecipitation and FACS analysis of sorted mouse pre-B cells and
plasma cells, they found that IgJ was expressed in the plasma cell
stage, whereas Crlz1 was expressed in the pre-B cell stage. The
stage-specific expression of IgJ and Crlz1 was regulated by chromatin
accessibility and acetylation. DNase I hypersensitive site 1 on the IgJ
promoter was opened in plasma cells, but hypersensitive sites 9 and 10
on the Crlz1 promoter were opened in pre-B cells. H3 (see 602810) and H4
(see 602822) histones were hyperacetylated in the chromatin of Crlz1 in
pre-B cells, whereas those in the chromatin of IgJ were hyperacetylated
in plasma cells. Lim et al. (2006) concluded that the CRLZ1-IgJ locus
shows stage-specific gene expression regulation, and they proposed that
additional regulatory elements may exist between the genes to coordinate
chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation over the locus.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lim et al. (2006) mapped the UTP3 gene
upstream of the IGJ gene on chromosome 4q21. The UTP3 and IGJ genes are
transcribed in opposite directions, and the positioning and orientation
of the genes are conserved on mouse chromosome 5.

Ku ANTIGEN, 70-KD SUBUNIT; Ku70;;
LUPUS AUTOANTIGEN p70;;
THYROID-LUPUS AUTOANTIGEN; TLAA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The XRCC6 gene encodes subunit p70 of the p70/p80 autoantigen. The
p70/p80 autoantigen consists of 2 proteins of molecular mass of
approximately 70,000 and 80,000 daltons that dimerize to form a 10 S
DNA-binding complex. See 194364 for discussion of the gene encoding the
p80 subunit. Exchange of immunologic reagents showed that the p70/p80
autoantigen is identical to the Ku antigen, the Ki antigen, and the 86-
to 70-kD protein complex. The p70/p80 complex binds to the ends of
double-stranded DNA in a cell cycle-dependent manner, being associated
with chromosomes of interphase cells, followed by complete dissociation
from the condensing chromosomes in early prophase. Both p70 and p80
contain phosphoserine residues. A role for the antigen in DNA repair or
transposition has been proposed.

CLONING

Some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (152700) produce very
large amounts of autoantibodies to p70 and p80. Reeves and Sthoeger
(1989) used autoantibodies from the serum of such a person to isolate
cDNA clones encoding p70, the protein that is thought to mediate binding
of the Ku complex to DNA. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence
of p70 suggested structural similarities with other DNA-binding
proteins. The information may be useful in examining the function of the
Ku complex, as well as the causes of autoimmunity to this antigen. The
presence of a 61-residue acidic region rich in serine raised the
possibility that its charge might be modulated by phosphorylation. The
predicted amino acid sequence also contains 2 regions with periodic
repeats of either leucine alone or leucine alternating with serine every
seventh position. The latter repeat showed structural similarities with
the 'leucine zipper' regions of the MYC oncogene product. The p70
antigen and the p80 antigen did not appear to have extensive sequence
homology, according to analysis of RNA blots and immunologic criteria.

The autoantibody that was thought to identify the TSH receptor and which
was used for isolating cDNA clones that were mapped to 22q11-q13 by
Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs and by linkage of RFLPs to
CYP2D (124030) (McBride et al., 1987; Mitchell et al., 1989) was shown
not to represent TSHR (603372) but rather a separate, 70-kD thyroid
autoantigen (Chan et al., 1989). The autoantibody has been found in
patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (Graves disease) as well as in
those with lupus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takiguchi et al. (1996) showed that the mouse Ku70 gene contains 13
exons (exon 1 is untranslated) spanning about 24 kb of genomic DNA and
encodes a predicted 608-amino acid polypeptide (compared to 609 residues
in humans).

MAPPING

Takiguchi et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Ku70 gene to chromosome 15E by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Koike et al. (1996) mapped the Ku70
gene to mouse chromosome 1 and rat chromosome 9. The human Ku70 gene
resides on chromosome 22q11-q13 (Chan et al., 1989).

GENE FUNCTION

Tuteja et al. (1994) purified from HeLa cells an enzyme they called DNA
helicase II, an ATP-dependent DNA unwinding enzyme. They showed that it
is a heterodimer of 72 and 87 kD polypeptides. Sequencing showed that it
is identical to the Ku autoantigen. The exclusively nuclear location of
this particular DNA helicase II/Ku antigen, its highly specific affinity
for double-stranded DNA, its abundance, and its exclusive DNA-duplex
unwinding activity pointed to additional roles for this molecule in DNA
metabolism. Hartley et al. (1995) noted that the Ku autoantigen is a
component of DNA-dependent protein kinase (see PRKDC; 600899).

Double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) pose a major threat to living cells, and
several mechanisms for repairing these lesions have evolved. Eukaryotes
can process DSBs by homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end
joining (NHEJ). NHEJ connects DNA ends irrespective of their sequence,
and it predominates in mitotic cells, particularly during G1 (Takata et
al., 1998). HR requires interaction of the broken DNA molecule with an
intact homologous copy, and allows restoration of the original DNA
sequence. HR is active during G2 of the mitotic cycle and predominates
during meiosis, when the cell creates DSBs, which must be repaired by HR
to ensure proper chromosome segregation. How the cell controls the
choice between the 2 repair pathways was investigated by Goedecke et al.
(1999). They demonstrated a physical interaction between the mammalian
Ku70, which is essential for NHEJ (Baumann and West, 1998), and MRE11
(600814), which functions both in NHEJ and meiotic HR. Moreover, they
showed that irradiated cells deficient for Ku70 are incapable of
targeting Mre11 to subnuclear foci that may represent DNA-repair
complexes. Nevertheless, Ku70 and Mre11 were differentially expressed
during meiosis. In the mouse testis, Mre11 and Ku70 colocalized in
nuclei of somatic cells and in the XY bivalent. In early meiotic
prophase, however, when meiotic recombination is most probably
initiated, Mre11 was abundant, whereas Ku70 was not detectable. Goedecke
et al. (1999) proposed that Ku70 acts as a switch between the 2 DSB
repair pathways. When present, Ku70 destines DSBs for NHEJ by binding to
DNA ends and attracting other factors for NHEJ, including Mre11; when
absent, it allows participation of DNA ends and Mre11 in the meiotic HR
pathway.

The Drosophila Dmblm locus is a homolog of the human Bloom syndrome gene
(604610). Kusano et al. (2001) demonstrated that mutant Dmblm phenotypes
were partially rescued by an extra copy of the DNA repair gene Ku70,
indicating that the 2 genes functionally interact in vivo.

Using human and hamster cells, Mari et al. (2006) showed that Ku
heterodimers on DNA ends were in dynamic equilibrium with Ku70/Ku80 in
solution, suggesting that formation of the NHEJ complex is reversible.
Accumulation of XRCC4 (194363) on DNA double-strand breaks depended on
the presence of Ku70/Ku80, but not PRKDC. Mari et al. (2006) found that
XRCC4 interacted directly with Ku70, and they hypothesized that XRCC4
serves as a flexible tether between Ku70/Ku80 and LIG4 (601837).

Pace et al. (2010) found a genetic interaction between the Fanconi
anemia gene FANCC (227645) and the NHEJ factor Ku70. Disruption of both
FANCC and Ku70 suppressed sensitivity to crosslinking agents, diminished
chromosome breaks, and reversed defective homologous recombination. Ku70
binds directly to free DNA ends, committing them to NHEJ repair. Pace et
al. (2010) showed that purified FANCD2 (227646), a downstream effector
of the Fanconi anemia pathway, might antagonize Ku70 activity by
modifying such DNA substrates. Pace et al. (2010) concluded that these
results reveal a function for the Fanconi anemia pathway in processing
DNA ends, thereby diverting double-strand break repair from abortive
NHEJ and toward homologous recombination.

Congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A; 607855) is caused by
mutations in the gene encoding laminin-alpha-2 (LAMA2; 156225). Bax
(600040)-mediated muscle cell death is a significant contributor to the
severe neuromuscular pathology seen in the Lama2-null mouse model of
MDC1A. Vishnudas and Miller (2009) analyzed molecular mechanisms of Bax
regulation in normal and LAMA2-deficient muscles and cells, including
myogenic cells from MDC1A patients. In mouse myogenic cells, Bax
coimmunoprecipitated with the multifunctional protein Ku70. In addition,
cell-permeable pentapeptides designed from Ku70, termed Bax-inhibiting
peptides (BIPs), inhibited staurosporine-induced Bax translocation and
cell death in mouse myogenic cells. Acetylation of Ku70, which can
inhibit binding to Bax and can be an indicator of increased
susceptibility to cell death, was more abundant in Lama2-null mouse
muscles than in normal mouse muscles. Myotubes formed in culture from
human LAMA2-deficient patient myoblasts produced high levels of
activated caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) when grown on poly-L-lysine, but not
when grown on a LAMA2-containing substrate or when treated with BIPs.
Cytoplasmic Ku70 in human LAMA2-deficient myotubes was both reduced in
amount and more highly acetylated than in normal myotubes. Vishnudas and
Miller (2009) concluded that increased susceptibility to cell death
appears to be an intrinsic property of human LAMA2-deficient myotubes
and that Ku70 is a regulator of Bax-mediated pathogenesis.

By screening human cells transfected with foreign DNA, Zhang et al.
(2011) observed expression of IFNL1 (IL29; 607403), a type III
interferon (IFN), rather than type I IFN (e.g., IFNB1; 147640).
Pull-down analysis with cytosolic proteins identified Ku70 and Ku80 as
the DNA-binding proteins. Knockdown and reporter analyses revealed that
Ku70 functioned as a DNA sensor that induced IFNL1 activation. Analysis
of the IFNL1 promoter indicated that positive-regulatory domain I and
IFN-stimulated response element sites were predominantly involved in
DNA-mediated IFNL1 activation. Pull-down assays showed that IFNL1
induction was associated with activation of IRF1 (147575) and IRF7
(605047). Zhang et al. (2011) concluded that Ku70 mediates the induction
of type III IFN by DNA, as may occur in viral infections or DNA
vaccination.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Walker et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of the human Ku
heterodimer both alone and bound to a 55-nucleotide DNA element at 2.7-
and 2.5-angstrom resolution, respectively. Ku70 and Ku80 share a common
topology and form a dyad-symmetrical molecule with a preformed ring that
encircles duplex DNA. The binding site can cradle 2 full turns of DNA
while encircling only the central 3-4 base pairs. Ku makes no contacts
with DNA bases and few with the sugar-phosphate backbone, but it fits
sterically to major and minor groove contours so as to position the DNA
helix in a defined path through the protein ring. Walker et al. (2001)
concluded that these features are well designed to structurally support
broken DNA ends and to bring the DNA helix into phase across the
junction during end processing and ligation.

ANIMAL MODEL

Li et al. (1998) presented evidence that inactivation of the Ku70 gene
by targeted disruption in mice and derived cell lines leads to a
propensity for malignant transformation both in vitro and in vivo. In
vitro, Ku70 -/- mouse fibroblasts displayed an increased rate of sister
chromatid exchange and a high frequency of spontaneous neoplastic
transformation. In vivo, Ku70 -/- mice, known to be defective in B- but
not T-lymphocyte maturation, developed thymic and disseminated T-cell
lymphomas at a mean age of 6 months with CD4+/CD8+ tumor cells. In
addition, many of the knockout mice showed segmental aganglionosis
affecting the small intestine and the colon. These findings demonstrated
that Ku70 deficiency facilitates neoplastic growth and suggested a role
of the Ku70 locus in tumor suppression.

HISTORY

An article by Sawada et al. (2003) discussing the function of Ku70 was
retracted because it contained 'a significant number of digital image
manipulations in the published figures.' The retraction superceded the
previously published erratum for this article.

602591	TITLE *602591 KINESIN HEAVY CHAIN MEMBER 2A; KIF2A
;;KIF2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KIF2A, KIF2B (615142), and KIF2C (604538) comprise the kinesin-13 family
of microtubule motor proteins, which are characterized by the
localization of the kinesin motor domain in the middle of the
polypeptide. Kinesin-13 proteins are nonmotile and induce microtubule
depolymerization by disassembling tubulin subunits from the polymer end.
KIF2A is essential for both bipolar spindle assembly and chromosome
movement (summary by Manning et al., 2007).

For background information on kinesins, see 148760.

CLONING

By using cDNA differential display, Debernardi et al. (1997) isolated a
kinesin heavy chain gene (KIF2) as one regulated by the synthetic
retinoid HPR, a cancer chemopreventive agent and inducer of apoptotic
cell death. The KIF2 gene, which they called HK2 for 'human kinesin-2,'
was cloned from follicular B-cell lymphoma cells treated with HPR. Human
KIF2 is a predicted 679-amino acid protein that is 97% identical to
mouse KIF2 protein. On Northern blots, KIF2 was expressed as a 3.5-kb
mRNA in several tissues.

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF2A belongs to the
kinesin-13 family.

MAPPING

Debernardi et al. (1997) mapped the KIF2 gene to chromosome 5q12-q13 by
PCR of a panel of radiation hybrid clones.

Gross (2013) mapped the KIF2A gene to chromosome 5q12.1 based on an
alignment of the KIF2A sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC031828) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference in human U2OS and RPE cells, Manning et al.
(2007) found that each of the kinesin-13 family members has a distinct
role during mitosis. MCAK (KIF2C) deficiency resulted in exaggerated
astral microtubule length. KIF2A and KIF2B deficiency resulted in
similar defects, with delayed progression through mitosis, appearance of
monopolar or disorganized spindles, and increased number of binucleated
or dead cells. However, knockdown of KIF2B, but not KIF2A, reduced the
poleward kinetochore force acting on chromosomes. Knockdown of KIF2B did
not disrupt the pole localization of KIF2A or the centromere and spindle
localization of MCAK.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 unrelated patients with complex cortical dysplasia with other brain
malformations-3 (CDCBM3; 615411), Poirier et al. (2013) identified 2
different de novo heterozygous mutations in the KIF2A gene (H321D,
602591.0001 and S317N, 602591.0002). The first mutation was found by
whole-exome sequencing and was not present in several genomic databases,
including dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, the Exome Variant Server, and a local
Paris Descartes Bioinformatics platform database. The second mutation
was found by screening 162 individuals with various malformations of
cortical development for variants in kinesin genes. The patients had
microcephaly, early-onset epilepsy, and various malformations of
cortical development, including agyria, posterior predominant
pachygyria, subcortical band heterotopia, and thin corpus callosum. One
patient had dysmorphic basal ganglia. Both had severe developmental
delay and were bedridden with spastic paraplegia at ages 1 and 4 years,
respectively. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutations caused abnormal protein folding, resulting in abnormal
cellular localization and a loss of protein function. Because KIF2A
functions as a dimer, Poirier et al. (2013) postulated a
dominant-negative effect. The findings extended the association between
microtubule-based cellular processes and proper cortical development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Homma et al. (2003) found that brains of Kif2a -/- mice showed multiple
phenotypes, including aberrant axonal branching due to overextension of
collateral branches. In Kif2a -/- growth cones,
microtubule-depolymerizing activity decreased. Moreover, many individual
microtubules showed abnormal behavior at the Kif2a -/- cell edge. The
authors concluded that KIF2A regulates microtubule dynamics at the
growth cone edge by depolymerizing microtubules and that it plays an
important role in the suppression of collateral branch extension.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CORTICAL DYSPLASIA, COMPLEX, WITH OTHER BRAIN MALFORMATIONS 3
KIF2A, HIS321ASP

In a 1-year-old child with complex cortical dysplasia with other brain
malformations-3 (CDCBM3; 615411), Poirier et al. (2013) identified a de
novo heterozygous c.961C-G transversion in the KIF2A gene, resulting in
a his321-to-asp (H321D) substitution at a conserved residue located
around the ATP nucleotide-binding pocket in the kinesin motor domain.
The mutation was found by whole-exome sequencing and was not found in
several genomic databases, including dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, the Exome
Variant Server, and a local Paris Descartes Bioinformatics platform
database. In vitro functional expression studies in E. coli showed
decreased levels of soluble mutant protein in the extract compared to
wildtype, suggesting that the mutation caused misfolding and retention
of the protein in the insoluble fraction, resulting in decreased levels
of functional protein. Overexpression of the mutant protein in COS-7
cells and human fibroblasts resulted in abnormal cellular localization
with predominant decoration of microtubules rather than diffuse
punctiform cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution as observed for wildtype
KIF2A. Because KIF2A functions as a dimer, Poirier et al. (2013)
postulated a dominant-negative effect.

.0002
CORTICAL DYSPLASIA, COMPLEX, WITH OTHER BRAIN MALFORMATIONS 3
KIF2A, SER317ASN

In a 4-year-old child with CDCBM3 (615411), Poirier et al. (2013)
identified a de novo heterozygous c.950G-A transition in the KIF2A gene,
resulting in a ser317-to-asn (S317N) substitution at a conserved residue
located around the ATP nucleotide-binding pocket in the kinesin motor
domain. In vitro functional expression studies in E. coli showed
decreased levels of soluble mutant protein in the extract compared to
wildtype, suggesting that the mutation caused misfolding and retention
of the protein in the insoluble fraction, resulting in decreased levels
of functional protein. Overexpression of the mutant protein in COS-7
cells and human fibroblasts resulted in abnormal cellular localization
with predominant decoration of microtubules rather than diffuse
punctiform cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution as observed for wildtype
KIF2A. Because KIF2A functions as a dimer, Poirier et al. (2013)
postulated a dominant-negative effect.

615051	TITLE *615051 ANKYRIN REPEAT- AND SOCS BOX-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6; ASB6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins of the ASB family, such as ASB6, contain central tandem ankyrin
(see 612641) repeats and a C-terminal suppressor of cytokine signaling
(SOCS) box. SOCS box proteins are predicted to be involved in protein
degradation by acting as a bridge between substrate proteins and E3
ubiquitin protein ligases (see 601623) (review by Kile et al., 2002).

CLONING

Kile et al. (2001) showed that the deduced 418-amino acid mouse Asb6
protein has 8 tandem ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal SOCS box.

GENE FUNCTION

Kohroki et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged ASB6 and several other
ASB family members interacted with endogenous CUL5 (601741) and RBX2
(RNF7; 603863) in immunoprecipitated HEK293 cells. The ASB proteins did
not interact with CUL2 (603135) or RBX1 (603814).

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the ASB6 gene to chromosome 9q34.11 based on an
alignment of the ASB6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000555) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602711	TITLE *602711 AMYLOID BETA A4 PRECURSOR PROTEIN-BINDING, FAMILY B, MEMBER 3; APBB3
;;FE65-LIKE 2; FE65L2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

To identify genes similar to Fe65 (602709), Duilio et al. (1998)
screened a rat brain cDNA library and isolated a Fe65L2 cDNA encoding a
deduced 504-amino acid polypeptide. Like Fe65 and Fe65L1 (602710), the
rat Fe65L2 protein contains 2 phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains and
a WW domain. Northern blot analysis detected predominant expression of a
2-kb Fe65L2 mRNA in rat brain and testis.

Using the rat cDNA fragment as probe, Tanahashi and Tabira (1999) cloned
human Fe65L2 from a fetal brain cDNA library. Fe65L2 encodes a deduced
486-amino acid protein that shares 86% sequence identity with the rat
protein. Using RT-PCR of human fetal brain mRNA, Tanahashi and Tabira
(1999) also identified a variant, caused by the splicing of a
6-nucleotide mini-exon, that results results in a peptide lacking 2
amino acids in the first PTB domain. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a 2.2-kb transcript expressed mainly in the brain and in
all brain regions tested. A 2.9-kb transcript was found in other
tissues, with strongest expression in pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Duilio et al. (1998) showed that the Fe65L2 protein binds to the
intracellular domain of the Alzheimer disease amyloid precursor protein
(APP; 104760) both in vitro and in vivo. Using in vitro translation of
recombinant proteins, Tanahashi and Tabira (1999) confirmed interaction
between the second PTB domain of Fe65L2 with the intracellular domain of
APP and APP-like proteins.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tanahashi and Tabira (1999) determined that the FE65L2 gene contains 13
exons distributed over 6 kb, and that the genomic organization is
similar to that of the FE65 gene. By primer extension analysis, they
identified 2 transcription start sites in a CpG island.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Tanahashi and Tabira (1999) mapped the
FE65L2 gene to chromosome 5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 556 Japanese patients with Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300), Tanahashi
et al. (2002) found a decreased risk for early-onset of the disease
(younger than 60 years) associated with a 954C-T polymorphism in exon 11
of the Fe65L2 gene (OR for TT genotype was 0.32).

120436	TITLE *120436 MutL, E. COLI, HOMOLOG OF, 1; MLH1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MLH is homologous to the E. coli MutL gene and is involved in DNA
mismatch repair. Heterozygous mutations in the MLH1 gene result in
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer-2 (HNPCC2; 609310)
(Papadopoulos et al., 1994).

CLONING

After human homologs of the mutS gene of bacteria and yeast were found
to have mutations responsible for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal
cancer (HNPCC1; 120435), Papadopoulos et al. (1994) searched for other
human mismatch repair (MMR) genes. A survey of EST databases derived
from random cDNA clones revealed 3 additional human MMR genes, all
related to the bacterial mutL gene. One of these genes was MLH1. The
other 2 genes had a slightly greater similarity to the yeast mutL
homolog PMS1 and were therefore denoted PMS1 (600258) and PMS2 (600259),
respectively.

Genuardi et al. (1998) characterized the normal alternative splicing of
the MLH1 gene and reported a number of splice variants that exist in
various tissue types. They observed splice variants lacking exons 6/9,
9, 9/10, 9/10/11, 10/11, 12, 16, and 17. The level of expression varied
among different samples. All isoforms were found in 43 to 100% of the
mononuclear blood cell samples, as well as in other tissues. The authors
cautioned that knowledge of existence of multiple alternative splicing
events not caused by genomic DNA changes is important for the evaluation
of the results of molecular diagnostic tests based on RNA analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Hypermutable H6 colorectal tumor cells are defective in strand-specific
mismatch repair and bear defects in both alleles of the human MLH1 gene.
Li and Modrich (1995) purified to near homogeneity an activity from HeLa
cells that complemented H6 nuclear extracts to restore repair
proficiency on a set of heteroduplex DNAs representing the 8 base-base
mismatches as well as a number of slipped-strand, insertion/deletion
mispairs. The activity behaved as a single species during fractionation
and copurified with proteins of 85 and 100 kD. Microsequence analysis
demonstrated both of these proteins to be homologs of bacterial MutL,
with the former corresponding to the human MLH1 product and the latter
to the product of human PMS2 or a closely related gene. The 1:1 molar
stoichiometry of the 2 polypeptides and their hydrodynamic behavior
indicated formation of a heterodimer. These observations indicated that
interactions between members of the family of the human MutL homologs
may be restricted.

Wang et al. (2000) used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry
analyses to identify BRCA1 (113705)-associated proteins. They found that
BRCA1 is part of a large multisubunit protein complex of tumor
suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal transducers. They named this
complex BASC, for 'BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex.' Among
the DNA repair proteins identified in the complex were ATM (607585), BLM
(604610), MSH2 (609309), MSH6 (600678), MLH1, the RAD50 (604040)-MRE11
(600814)-NBS1 (602667) complex, and the RFC1 (102579)-RFC2 (600404)-RFC4
(102577) complex. Wang et al. (2000) suggested that BASC may serve as a
sensor of abnormal DNA structures and/or as a regulator of the
postreplication repair process.

Meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes generates crossover
and noncrossover products, which are derived from the formation of
double-strand breaks (DSBs) and result from distinct DSB repair
pathways. Guillon et al. (2005) analyzed crossovers and noncrossovers in
oogenesis and spermatogenesis in mice and determined that both crossover
and noncrossover pathways were Spo11 (605114) dependent. Mlh1 was
required for the formation of most crossovers, but not noncrossovers.
The remaining 5 to 10% of crossover products did not require Mlh1.
Guillon et al. (2005) concluded that the major crossover pathway
requires MLH1 for crossover formation and for mismatch repair of
heteroduplex DNA.

MutL-alpha is a heterodimer of MLH1 and PMS2 that is required for
mismatch repair. Kadyrov et al. (2006) identified human MutL-alpha as a
latent endonuclease activated in a DNA mismatch-, MutS-alpha (see
609309)-, RFC-, PCNA (176740)-, and ATP-dependent manner. Incision of a
nicked heteroduplex by this 4-protein system was strongly biased to the
nicked strand. A mismatch-containing DNA segment spanned by 2 strand
breaks was then removed by the 5-prime-to-3-prime activity of
MutS-alpha-activated exonuclease-1 (EXO1; 606063). By mutation analysis,
Kadyrov et al. (2006) mapped the endonuclease active site to a conserved
motif in PMS2.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Ban and Yang (1998) determined the crystal structure of a 40-kD
N-terminal fragment of E. coli MutL that retains all of the conserved
residues in the MutL family. The structure of MutL is homologous to that
of an ATPase-containing fragment of DNA gyrase. The authors demonstrated
that MutL binds and hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and Pi. Mutations in the MutL
family that cause deficiencies in DNA mismatch repair and a
predisposition to cancer mainly occur in the putative ATP-binding site.
Ban and Yang (1998) also provided evidence that the flexible, yet
conserved loops surrounding this ATP-binding site undergo conformational
changes upon ATP hydrolysis, thereby modulating interactions between
MutL and other components of the repair machinery.

Ellison et al. (2001) performed quantitative in vivo DNA mismatch repair
(MMR) assays in the yeast S. cerevisiae to determine the functional
significance of amino acid replacements in MLH1 and MSH2 genes observed
in the human population. Missense codons previously observed in human
genes were introduced at the homologous residue in the yeast MLH1 or
MSH2 genes. Three classes of missense codons were found: (i) complete
loss of function, i.e., mutations; (ii) variants indistinguishable from
wildtype protein, i.e., silent polymorphisms; and (iii) functional
variants which supported MMR at reduced efficiency, i.e., efficiency
polymorphisms. There was a good correlation between the functional
results in yeast and available human clinical data regarding penetrance
of the missense codon. The authors suggested that differences in the
efficiency of DNA MMR may exist between individuals in the human
population due to common polymorphisms.

Using bioinformatic analysis, Kosinski et al. (2010) determined that the
dimerization of MLH1 and PMS2 occurs via their C-terminal domains and
involves residues 531 to 549 and 740 to 756 in MLH1 and residues 679 to
699 and 847 to 862 in PMS2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Han et al. (1995) reported that the human MLH1 gene consists of 19
coding exons spanning approximately 100 kb. Exons 1 to 7 contain a
region that is highly conserved in the MLH1 and PMS1 genes of yeast.

MAPPING

Papadopoulos et al. (1994) mapped the MLH1 gene to chromosome 3p21.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Bronner et al. (1994) mapped the
MLH1 gene to the same region, 3p23-p21.3, by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The mapping of MLH1 to 3p21 was of interest because markers in that area
had been linked to hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer in several
families (Lindblom et al., 1993). Searching for mutations in the MLH1
gene, Papadopoulos et al. (1994) performed RT-PCR analyses of
lymphoblastoid cell RNA and directly sequenced the coding region of the
gene in 10 HNPCC kindreds linked to 3p markers. All affected individuals
from 7 Finnish kindreds exhibited a heterozygous deletion of codons 578
to 632. The derivation of 5 of these 7 kindreds could be traced to a
common ancestor, and the presence of the same presumptive defect in 2
other kindreds supported a 'founder effect' for many cases of HNPCC in
the Finnish population. Codons 578 to 632 were found to constitute a
single exon that was deleted from 1 allele in the 7 kindreds. This exon
encodes several highly conserved amino acids found at identical
positions in yeast MLH1. In another 3p-linked family, Papadopoulos et
al. (1994) observed a 4-nucleotide deletion beginning at the first
position of codon 727 and producing a frameshift with a new stop codon
located 166 nucleotides downstream. As a result, the C-terminal 19 amino
acids of MLH1 were substituted with 53 different amino acids, some
encoded by nucleotides normally in the 3-prime untranslated region.
Another kindred displayed a 4-nucleotide insertion between codons 755
and 756. This insertion resulted in a frameshift and extension of the
open reading frame to include 99 nucleotides downstream of the normal
stop codon. One cell line showed a transversion from TCA to TAA in codon
252, resulting in conversion of a serine to a stop (120436.0001).

Simultaneously and independently, Bronner et al. (1994) likewise
implicated the human MutL homolog, MLH1, in the form of HNPCC that maps
to 3p. In 1 chromosome 3-linked HNPCC family, they demonstrated a
missense mutation in affected individuals (120436.0002).

Using PCR-SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing to examine the entire coding
region of the MLH1 gene in DNAs of 34 unrelated cancer patients from
HNPCC pedigrees, Han et al. (1995) found germline mutations in 8 (24%):
4 missense mutations, 1 intron mutation that would affect splicing, and
3 frameshift mutations resulting in truncation of the gene product
downstream of the mutation site.

Maliaka et al. (1996) identified 6 different novel mutations in the MLH1
and MSH2 genes in Russian and Moldavian HNPCC families. Three of these
mutations occurred in CpG dinucleotides and led to a premature stop
codon, splicing defect, or an amino acid substitution in evolutionarily
conserved residues. Analysis of a compilation of published mutations
including the new data suggested to the authors that CpG dinucleotides
within the coding regions of the MSH2 and MLH1 genes are hotspots for
single basepair substitutions.

From a study of unrelated HNPCC families, Wijnen et al. (1996) commented
that, whereas the spectrum of mutations at the MSH2 gene is
heterogeneous, a cluster of MLH1 mutations were found in the region
encompassing exons 15 and 16, which accounts for 50% of all the
independent MLH1 mutations described to date. They stated that their
finding has great practical value in the design of clinical genetic

By screening members of Finnish families displaying HNPCC for
predisposing germline mutations in MSH2 and MLH1, Nystrom-Lahti et al.
(1995) showed that 2 mutations in MLH1 together account for 63% (19/30)
of kindreds meeting international diagnostic criteria. One mutation,
originally detected as a 165-bp deletion in MLH1 cDNA comprising exon
16, was shown to represent a 3.5-kb genomic deletion most likely
resulting from Alu-mediated recombination (120436.0004). The second
mutation destroyed the splice acceptor site of exon 6 (120436.0005).
They commented that this was the first report of Alu-mediated
recombination causing a prevalent, dominantly inherited predisposition
to cancer. Nystrom-Lahti et al. (1995) designed a simple diagnostic test
based on PCR for both mutations. Thus 2 ancestral founding mutations
account for most Finnish HNPCC kindreds.

Sasaki et al. (1996) studied 43 tumors and corresponding normal tissues
from 23 Japanese patients with multiple primary cancers. They found no
germline mutations of the MLH1 gene and detected only 2 somatic missense
mutations among the 43 tumors examined. These 2 tumors had each shown
increased replication error (RER+) at more than 1 of the 5
microsatellite loci examined. Only the second of these 2 mutations
occurred in an evolutionarily conserved domain of the protein.

Jager et al. (1997) reported studies based on the Danish HNPCC register
comprising 28 families that fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria. They found
an intron 14 founder mutation in the MLH1 gene (120436.0007) in
approximately 25% of the kindreds and showed that it was associated with
an attenuated HNPCC phenotype characterized by a highly reduced
frequency of extracolonic tumors. The mutation was a combined 7-bp
deletion and 4-bp insertion that 'silenced the mutated allele,' i.e., it
was not expressed. Tumors exhibited microsatellite instability (MSI),
and loss of the wildtype MLH1 allele was prevalent. Jager et al. (1997)
proposed that the mutation resulted in a milder phenotype because the
mutated MLH1 protein was prevented from exerting a dominant-negative
effect on the concerted action of the mismatch repair system.

Huang et al. (2001) studied a family with HNPCC in which the proband was
diagnosed with colorectal cancer at the age of 14 years; her mother,
grandmother, and aunt had been diagnosed with HNPCC in their twenties.
DNA sequencing revealed that the proband was heterozygous for the R226X
mutation (120436.0011).

Shimodaira et al. (1998) described a new method for detecting mutations
in MLH1 HNPCC using a dominant mutator effect of MLH1 cDNA expressed in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Most MLH1 missense mutations identified in
HNPCC patients abolish the dominant mutator effect. Furthermore, PCR
amplification of MLH1 cDNA from mRNA of an HNPCC patient, followed by in
vivo recombination into a gap expression vector, allowed detection of a
heterozygous loss-of-function missense mutation in MLH1 using this
method. This functional assay offers a simple method for detecting and
evaluating pathogenic mutations in MLH1.

Liu et al. (1999) described 2 missense mutations in exon 16 of the MLH1
gene associated with colorectal cancer (see 120436.0012 and
120436.0013). The tumors did not show MSI, raising some potentially
important issues. First, even microsatellite-negative colorectal tumors
can be associated with germline mutations, and these will be missed if
an MSI test is used to select patients for mutation screening. Second,
the lack of MSI in these cases suggested that the mechanism involved in
the carcinogenesis could be different from that generally hypothesized.

In colorectal cancer arising in young Hong Kong Chinese, a high
incidence of microsatellite instability and germline mismatch repair
gene mutation has been found. Most of the germline mutations involve the
MSH2 gene, which is different from the mutation spectrum in the Western
population. In the MLH1 gene, alternative splicing is common, which
complicates RNA-based mutation detection methods. In contrast, large
deletions in MLH1, commonly observed in some ethnic groups, tend to
escape detection by exon-by-exon direct DNA sequencing. Chan et al.
(2001) reported the detection of a novel germline 1.8-kb deletion
involving exon 11 of the MLH1 gene in a Hong Kong hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer family. The mutation generated an mRNA
transcript with deletion of exons 10 and 11, which is indistinguishable
from one of the most common and predominant MLH1 splice variants. A
diagnostic test based on PCR of the breakpoint region led to the
identification of an additional young colorectal cancer patient with
this mutation. Haplotype analysis suggested that the 2 patients may
share a common ancestral mutation. The results represented a caveat to
investigators in the interpretation of alternative splicing and the
important implications for the design of MLH1 mutation detection
strategy in the Chinese population. The proband of one family developed
colorectal cancer at the age of 33 years. The second patient with no
family history of cancer developed colorectal cancer at the age of 38
years.

Viel et al. (2002) examined a series of 52 patients belonging to HNPCC
or HNPCC-related families, all of whom had previously tested negative
for point mutations in MMR genes. Southern blot mutation screening of
the MLH1 and MSH2 genes revealed abnormal restriction patterns in 3
patients who carried distinct MLH1 internal deletions. Although Alu
repeats are likely to be implicated in most cases of such deletions,
different molecular mechanisms may be involved. In particular, HNPCC
resulting from L1-mediated recombination was identified by Viel et al.
(2002) as another mechanism for MMR inactivating mutations.

Gorlov et al. (2003) evaluated colocalization of pathogenic missense
mutations (found in individuals with HNPCC) with high-score exonic
splicing enhancer (ESE) motifs in the MSH2 and MLH1 genes. They found
that pathogenic missense mutations in these genes are located in ESE
sites significantly more frequently than expected. Pathogenic missense
mutations also tended to decrease ESE scores, thus leading to a high
propensity for splicing defects. In contrast, nonpathogenic missense
mutations and nonsense mutations are distributed randomly in relation to
ESE sites. Comparison of the observed and expected frequencies of
missense mutations in ESE sites showed that pathogenic effects of 20% or
more of mutations in MSH2 result from disruption of ESE sites and
disturbed splicing. Similarly, pathogenic effects of 16% or more of
missense mutations in MLH1 genes are ESE related. Thus, the
colocalization of pathogenic missense mutations with ESE sites strongly
suggests that their pathogenic effects are splicing related.

Most susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC) is not accounted for by
known risk factors. Because MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 mutations underlie high
penetrance CRC susceptibility in HNPCC, Lipkin et al. (2004)
hypothesized that attenuated alleles might also underlie susceptibility
to sporadic CRC. They looked for gene variants associated with HNPCC in
Israeli probands with familial CRC unstratified with respect to the
microsatellite instability phenotype. Association studies identified a
new MLH1 variant (415G-C; 120436.0019) in approximately 1.3% of Israeli
CRC individuals self-described as Jewish, Christian, or Muslim. MLH1
415C conferred clinically significant susceptibility to CRC. In contrast
to classic HNPCC, CRCs associated with MLH1 415C usually did not have
the microsatellite instability (MSI) defect, which is important for
clinical mutation screening. Structural and functional analyses showed
that the normal ATPase function of MLH1 is attenuated, but not
eliminated, by the MLH1 415G-C mutation. These studies suggested that
variants of mismatch repair proteins with attenuated function may
account for a higher proportion of susceptibility to sporadic
microsatellite-stable CRC than theretofore assumed.

Oliveira et al. (2004) investigated KRAS (190070) in 158 HNPCC tumors
from patients with germline MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 mutations, 166
microsatellite-unstable (MSI-H), and 688 microsatellite-stable (MSS)
sporadic carcinomas. All tumors were characterized for MSI and 81 of 166
sporadic MSI-H CRCs were analyzed for MLH1 promoter hypermethylation.
KRAS mutations were observed in 40% of HNPCC tumors, and the mutation
frequency varied upon the mismatch repair gene affected: 48% (29/61) in
MSH2, 32% (29/91) in MLH1, and 83% (5/6) in MSH6 (P = 0.01). KRAS
mutation frequency was different between HNPCC, MSS, and MSI-H
colorectal cancers (P = 0.002), and MSI-H with MLH1 hypermethylation (P
= 0.005). Furthermore, HNPCC colorectal cancers had more G13D
(190070.0003) mutations than MSS (P less than 0.0001), MSI-H (P = 0.02),
or MSI-H tumors with MLH1 hypermethylation (P = 0.03). HNPCC colorectal
and sporadic MSI-H tumors without MLH1 hypermethylation shared similar
KRAS mutation frequency, in particular G13D. Oliveira et al. (2004)
concluded that, depending on the genetic/epigenetic mechanism leading to
MSI-H, the outcome in terms of oncogenic activation may be different,
reinforcing the idea that HNPCC, sporadic MSI-H (depending on the MLH1
status), and MSS colorectal cancers may target distinct kinases within
the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway.

Mangold et al. (2004) screened for mutations in the MSH2 and MLH1 genes
in 41 unrelated index patients diagnosed with Muir-Torre syndrome
(MRTES; 158320), most of whom were preselected for mismatch repair
deficiency in their tumor tissue. Germline mutations were identified in
27 patients (mutation detection rate of 66%). Mangold et al. (2004)
noted that 25 (93%) of the mutations were located in MSH2, in contrast
to HNPCC patients without the MRTES phenotype, in whom the proportions
of MLH1 and MSH2 mutations are almost equal (p less than 0.001). Mangold
et al. (2004) further noted that 6 (22%) of the mutation carriers did
not meet the Bethesda criteria for HNPCC and suggested that sebaceous
neoplasm be added to the HNPCC-specific malignancies in the Bethesda
guidelines.

Alazzouzi et al. (2005) studied the allelic distribution of
microsatellite repeat bat26 in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 6
carriers and 4 noncarriers from 2 HNPCC families harboring germline MLH1
and MSH2 mutations, respectively. In noncarriers, there was a gaussian
distribution with no bat26 alleles shorter than 21 adenine residues. All
6 MLH1/MSH2 mutation carriers showed unstable bat26 alleles (20 adenine
residues or shorter) with an overall frequency of 5.6% (102 of 1814
clones detected). Alazzouzi et al. (2005) suggested that detection of
short unstable bat26 alleles may assist in identifying asymptomatic
carriers belonging to families with no detectable MMR gene mutations.

Quehenberger et al. (2005) obtained estimates of the risk of colorectal
cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC) for carriers of disease-causing
mutations of the MSH2 and MLH1 genes. Families with known germline
mutations of these genes were extracted from the Dutch HNPCC cancer
registry. Ascertainment-corrected maximum likelihood estimation was
carried out on a competing risks model for CRC and EC. The MSH2 and MHL1
loci were analyzed jointly as there was no significant difference in
risk (p = 0.08). At age 70, CRC risk for men was 26.7% (95% CI, 12.6 to
51.0%) and for women, 22.4% (10.6 to 43.8%); the risk for EC was 31.5%
(11.1 to 70.3%). These estimates of risk were considerably lower than
ones previously used which did not account for the selection of
families.

Changes in the coding sequence, which may or may not affect the encoded
protein sequence, may disrupt exon splicing enhancers (ESEs), leading to
exon skipping. ESEs are short, degenerate, frequently purine-rich
sequences that are important in both constitutive and alternative
splicing. ESEs have been identified in a large number of genes, and
their disruption has been linked to several genetic disorders, including
HNPCC (Stella et al., 2001), cystic fibrosis (219700), Marfan syndrome
(154700), and Becker muscular dystrophy (300376). McVety et al. (2006)
studied a 3-bp deletion at the 5-prime end of exon 3 of MLH1
(120436.0023), resulting in deletion of exon 3 from RNA. Splicing assays
suggested that the inclusion of exon 3 in mRNA was ESE-dependent. The
exon 3 ESE was not recognized by all available motif-scoring matrices,
highlighting the importance of RNA analysis in the detection of
ESE-disrupting mutations.

Pagenstecher et al. (2006) examined 19 variants in the MLH1 and MSH2
genes detected in patients with HNPCC for expression at the RNA level.
Ten of the 19 were found to affect splicing, including several variants
which were predicted to be missense mutations in exonic sequences (see,
e.g., 120436.0024). The findings suggested that mRNA examination of MLH1
and MSH2 mutations should precede functional tests at the protein
levels.

Without preselection and regardless of family history, Barnetson et al.
(2006) recruited 870 patients under the age of 55 years soon after they
received the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. They studied these patients
for germline mutations in DNA mismatch-repair genes MLH1, MSH2 (609309),
and MSH6 (600678) and developed a 2-stage model by multivariate logistic
regression for the prediction of the presence of mutations in these
genes. Stage 1 of the model incorporated only clinical variables; stage
2 comprised analysis of the tumor by immunohistochemical staining and
tests for microsatellite instability. The model was validated in an
independent population of patients. Furthermore, they analyzed 2,938
patient-years of follow-up to determine whether genotype influenced
survival. Among the 870 participants, 38 mutations were found: 15 in
MLH1, 16 in MSH2, and 7 in MSH6. Carrier frequencies in men (6%) and
women (3%) differed significantly (P less than 0.04). Survival among
carriers was not significantly different from that among noncarriers.

Tournier et al. (2008) examined potential splicing defects of 56
unclassified variants in the MLH1 gene and 31 in the MSH2 gene that were
identified in 82 French patients with Lynch syndrome. The variants
comprised 54 missense mutations, 10 synonymous changes, 20 intronic
variants, and 3 single-codon deletions. The authors developed an ex vivo
splicing assay by inserting PCR-amplified transcripts from patient
genomic DNA into a reporter minigene that was transfected into HeLa
cells. The ex vivo splicing assay showed that 22 of 85 variant alleles
affected splicing, including 4 exonic variants that affected putative
splicing regulatory elements. The study provided a tool for evaluating
putative pathogenic effects of unclassified variants found in these
genes.

Tang et al. (2009) identified pathogenic mutations or deletions in the
MLH1 or MSH2 gene in 61 (66%) of 93 Taiwanese families with HNPCC.
Forty-two families had MLH1 mutations, including 13 with the R265C
mutation (120436.0030) and 5 with a 3-bp deletion (1846delAAG;
120436.0018). Thirteen of the MLH1 mutations were novel, and 6 large
MLH1 deletions were also found. One family harbored MLH1 and MSH2
mutations.

Using structural modeling, Kosinski et al. (2010) identified 19
different MLH1 alterations located in the C-terminal domain involved in
dimerization with PMS2. Three changes, Q542L, L749P, and Y750X, caused
decreased coexpression of PMS2, which was unstable in the absence of
interaction with MLH1, suggesting that these 3 alterations interfered
with MLH1-PMS2 dimerization. In vitro studies showed that all 3 changes
compromised mismatch repair, suggesting that defects in dimerization can
abrogate proper MLH1 function. Additional biochemical studies showed
that 4 alterations with uncertain pathogenicity (A586P, L636P, T662P,
and R755W), could be considered deleterious because of poor expression
or poor MMR efficiency. Finally, some variants (e.g., K618A;
120436.0012), which were previously classified as deleterious, were
determined to have normal MMR activity.

- Constitutional Epigenetic Mutations, 'Germline Epimutation'

Herman et al. (1998) reported that hypermethylation of the 5-prime CpG
island of the MLH1 gene is found in most sporadic primary colorectal
cancers with MSI and that this methylation was often, but not
invariably, associated with loss of MLH1 protein expression. Such
methylation also occurred, but was less prominent, in MSI-negative
tumors, as well as in MSI-positive tumors with known mutations of a
mismatch repair gene. No hypermethylation of MSH2 was found.
Hypermethylation of colorectal cancer cell lines with MSI also was
frequently observed, and in such cases, reversal of the methylation with
5-aza-2-prime-deoxycytidine not only resulted in reexpression of MLH1
protein, but also in restoration of the mismatch repair capacity in
MMR-deficient cell lines. The results suggested that MSI in sporadic
colorectal cancer often results from epigenetic inactivation of MLH1 in
association with DNA methylation.

Germline defects in DNA mismatch repair genes account for the inherited
familial cancer syndrome of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancers in
which affected individuals show accelerated development of cancers of
the proximal colon, endometrium (608089), and stomach. These cancers
typically demonstrate inactivation of the residual wildtype MMR allele
inherited opposite the germline mutant, absence of DNA MMR activity in
in vitro assays, and acquisition of an in vivo mutator phenotype showing
up to 1,000-fold increased gene mutation rates. Additionally, these
cancers display an associated instability of genomic MSI. MSI is
similarly found in approximately 15 to 20% of sporadic colon cancers
that arise in individuals without any family history of colon cancer.
Like HNPCC-associated colon cancers, sporadic MSI colon cancers arise
predominantly in the proximal colon and show a high rate of frameshift
mutations at a mutation hotspot in the transforming growth factor-beta
type II receptor tumor suppressor gene (TGFBR2; 190182). Familial and
sporadic MSI colon cancers thus appear to share a common carcinogenic
pathway. Liu et al. (1995) established that MMR gene inactivation via
somatic mutation was the cause of some cases of sporadic MSI colon
cancers. However, unexpectedly, in many sporadic MSI colon cancers, MMR
genes were found to remain wildtype. MMR coding sequences were similarly
reported to be wildtype in many sporadic MSI endometrial cancers
(Katabuchi et al., 1995). Kane et al. (1997) described methylation of
the MLH1 promoter region in some MSI tumors. Veigl et al. (1998)
investigated a group of MSI cancer cell lines, most of which were
documented as established from antecedent MSI-positive malignant tumors.
In 5 of 6 such cases, they found that MLH1 protein was absent, even
though MLH1-coding sequences were wildtype. In each case, absence of
MLH1 protein was associated with the methylation of the MLH1 gene
promoter. Furthermore, in each case, treatment with the demethylating
agent 5-azacytidine induced expression of the absent MLH1 protein.
Moreover, in single cell clones, MLH1 expression could be turned on,
off, and on again by 5-azacytidine exposure, washout, and reexposure.
This epigenetic inactivation of MLH1 additionally accounted for the
silencing of both maternal and paternal tumor MLH1 alleles, both of
which could be reactivated by 5-azacytidine. Thus, substantial numbers
of human MSI cancers appear to arise by MLH1 silencing via an epigenetic
mechanism that can inactivate both of the MLH1 alleles. Promoter
methylation is intimately associated with this epigenetic silencing
mechanism.

Approximately 20% of endometrial cancers, the fifth most common cancer
of women worldwide, exhibit MSI. Although the frequency of MSI is higher
in endometrial cancers than in any other common malignancy, the genetic
basis of MSI in these tumors had remained elusive. Simpkins et al.
(1999) investigated the role that methylation of the MLH1 DNA mismatch
repair gene plays in the genesis of MSI in a large series of sporadic
endometrial cancers. The MLH1 promoter was methylated in 41 of 53 (77%)
MSI-positive cancers investigated. In MSI-negative tumors, on the other
hand, there was evidence for limited methylation in only 1 of 11 tumors
studied. Immunohistochemical investigation of a subset of the tumors
revealed that methylation of the MLH1 promoter in MSI-positive tumors
was associated with loss of MLH1 expression. Immunohistochemistry proved
that 2 MSI-positive tumors lacking MLH1 methylation failed to express
the MSH2 mismatch repair gene. Both of these cancers came from women who
had family and medical histories suggestive of inherited cancer
susceptibility. These observations suggested that epigenetic changes in
the MLH1 locus account for MSI in most cases of sporadic endometrial
cancers and provide additional evidence that the MSH2 gene may
contribute substantially to inherited forms of endometrial cancer.

Wheeler et al. (2000) studied 10 MSI-positive sporadic colorectal
cancers and 10 colorectal cancers from individuals with HNPCC. The
promoter region of the MLH1 gene was hypermethylated in 7 of the 10
MSI-positive sporadic cancers but in none of the HNPCC cancers. LOH at
MLH1 was observed in 8 of the 10 HNPCC colorectal cancers. Wheeler et
al. (2000) concluded that while the mutations and allelic loss are
responsible for the MSI-positive phenotype in HNPCC cancers, the
majority of MSI-positive sporadic cancers are hypermethylated in the
promoter region of MLH1; therefore, tumors from HNPCC patients acquire a
raised mutation rate through a different pathway than MSI-positive
sporadic tumors.

Epigenetic silencing can mimic genetic mutation by abolishing expression
of a gene. Suter et al. (2004) hypothesized that an epimutation could
occur in any gene as a germline event that predisposes to disease and
looked for examples in tumor suppressor genes in individuals with
cancer. They reported 2 individuals with soma-wide, allele-specific and
mosaic hypermethylation of the DNA mismatch repair gene MLH1. Both
individuals lacked evidence of genetic mutation in any mismatch repair
gene but had had multiple primary tumors that showed mismatch repair
deficiency, and both met clinical criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis
colorectal cancer.

Suter et al. (2004) reported methylation of the MLH1 promoter in a small
proportion of FACS-sorted spermatozoa from an individual who harbored a
soma-wide MLH1 epimutation. In an addendum to the report of Suter et al.
(2004) and in a correspondence, Hitchins and Ward (2007) described
reassessment of spermatozoa from the original individual using 2
quantitative techniques. They included methylation analysis of the
imprinted control gene SNRPN (182279), which is unmethylated in
spermatozoa cells. Their new data indicated that the MLH1 methylation
previously reported in spermatozoa was most likely an artifact,
attributable to a low level of contamination of the sample with either
somatic cells or free DNA derived from somatic cells. These data altered
the original interpretation that incomplete resetting of the epigenetic
mark on MLH1 had occurred in a proportion of the individual's
spermatozoa and suggested instead that reversal is complete in the
actual gametes.

Persons who have hypermethylation of 1 allele of MLH1 in somatic cells
throughout the body (a germline epimutation) have a predisposition for
the development of cancer in a pattern typical of hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. By studying the families of 2 such
persons, Hitchins et al. (2007) found evidence that the epimutation was
transmitted from a mother to her son but was erased in his spermatozoa.
The affected maternal allele was inherited by 3 other sibs from these 2
families, but in those offspring the allele had reverted to the normal
active state. These findings demonstrated a novel pattern of inheritance
of cancer susceptibility and were consistent with transgenerational
epigenetic inheritance.

Gosden and Feinberg (2007) referred to genetics and epigenetics as
'nature's pen-and-pencil set.' They suggested that transmission of
epimutations in MLH1 may have more general relevance than appears at
first site. Perhaps it is rather common for disease to be caused by the
failure of both the pen and pencil to write correctly. Bjornsson et al.
(2004) suggested an integrated epigenetic and genetic approach to common
human disease. The genetic and epigenetic model of common
diseases--including neuropsychiatric and rheumatologic diseases and
cancer--suggest that the epigenotype modulates genetic effects. The
epigenotype, in turn, is affected by the environment, the epigenotype of
the parents, age, and the genotype at loci that regulate DNA methylation
and chromatin.

Hitchins and Ward (2009) reviewed the etiologic role of constitutional
MLH1 epimutations (see, e.g., 120436.0015) in the development of
HNPCC-related cancers.

Crepin et al. (2012) identified constitutional MLH1 epimutations in 2
(1.5%) of 134 patients suspected of having Lynch syndrome who did not
have germline mutations in the MMR genes. One patient was a man who
developed colorectal cancer at age 35 years. Tumor tissue showed MSI,
and analysis of lymphocyte DNA showed complete hypermethylation of the
promoter of 1 MLH1 allele. The second patient was a woman with
colorectal cancer, who had a son with colorectal cancer and 2 daughters
with dysplastic colonic polyps. Blood from the mother showed 20%
hypermethylation at the MLH1 promoter, suggesting mosaicism. The son and
1 affected daughter also showed partial hypermethylation in blood,
suggesting transmission of the epimutation through the germline. Tumor
tissue from the 3 patients in the second family also showed partial
hypermethylation at MLH1, and tumor tissue from the daughter also
carried a somatic BRAF mutation (164757.0001).

Ward et al. (2013) screened 416 individuals with colorectal cancer
showing loss of MLH1 expression but without deleterious germline
mutations in MLH1. Constitutive DNA samples were screened for MLH1
methylation in all subjects and for promoter sequence changes in 357
individuals. Constitutional MLH1 epimutations were identified in 16
subjects. Of these, 7 (1.7%) had mono- or hemi-allelic methylation and 8
had low-level methylation (2%). Ward et al. (2013) concluded that
although rare, sequence changes in the regulatory region of MLH1 and
aberrant methylation may alone or together predispose to the development
of cancer and suggested that screening for these changes is warranted in
individuals who have a negative germline sequence screen of MLH1 and
loss of MLH1 expression in their tumor.

- Mismatch Repair Cancer Syndrome

Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300), sometimes referred to as brain
tumor-polyposis syndrome-1 or Turcot syndrome, results from biallelic
mutations in the mismatch repair genes. The phenotype classically
includes colorectal adenomas and brain tumors, most often glioblastoma.
However, Trimbath et al. (2001) and Ostergaard et al. (2005) noted that
the original definition may be too restrictive, and suggested that the
full manifestation of biallelic mutations in MMR genes includes the
additional findings of early-onset hematologic malignancies and
cafe-au-lait spots suggestive of neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1; 162200).

Hamilton et al. (1995) identified a mutation in the MLH1 gene
(120436.0003) in a patient with brain tumor-polyposis syndrome-1. He had
hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, glioblastoma, and transitional
cell carcinoma of the ureter. Tumor tissue samples showed DNA
replication errors.

Ricciardone et al. (1999) reported 3 sibs in an HNPCC family who
developed hematologic malignancy at a very early age, 2 of whom
displayed signs of NF1. DNA sequence analysis and allele-specific
amplification in 2 of the sibs revealed a homozygous MLH1 mutation
(120436.0010). Wang et al. (1999) described a typical HNPCC family in
which MMR-deficient children who were homozygous for an MLH1 mutation
(120436.0011) exhibited clinical features of de novo NF1 and early onset
of extracolonic cancers. The observations demonstrated that MMR
deficiency is compatible with human development but may lead to
mutations during embryogenesis. Based on these observations, Wang et al.
(1999) speculated that the NF1 gene is a preferential target for such
alterations.

Wang et al. (2003) demonstrated that somatic mutations of the NF1 gene
occur more commonly in MMR-deficient cells. They observed NF1
alterations in 5 of 10 tumor cell lines with microsatellite instability
compared to none of 5 MMR-proficient tumor cell lines. Somatic NF1
mutations were also detected in 2 primary tumors exhibiting
microsatellite instability.

ANIMAL MODEL

Baker et al. (1996) generated mice with a null mutation of the Mlh1
gene. They reported that in addition to compromising replication
fidelity, Mlh1 deficiency appeared to cause both male and female
sterility associated with reduced levels of chiasmata. Mlh1-deficient
spermatocytes exhibited high levels of prematurely separated chromosomes
and cell cycle arrest occurred in the first division of meiosis. Baker
et al. (1996) also carried out analysis of the Mlh1 protein in
spermatocytes and oocytes using immunostaining. They demonstrated that
Mlh1 localizes at chiasma sites on meiotic chromosomes. They concluded
that Mlh1 in the mouse is involved in both DNA mismatch repair and
meiotic crossing over.

Linkage maps constructed from genetic analysis of gene order and
crossover frequency provide few clues to the basis of genomewide
distribution of meiotic recombination which might point to variation in
chromosome structure that influences meiotic recombination. To bridge
that gap, Froenicke et al. (2002) generated a cytologic recombination
map that identified individual autosomes in the male mouse. They
prepared synaptonemal complex (SC) meiotic chromosome spreads from mouse
spermatocytes, identified each autosome by multicolor FISH using
chromosome-specific DNA libraries, and mapped more than 2,000 sites of
recombination along individual autosomes, using immunolocalization of
Mlh1, which as a mismatch repair protein marks crossover sites. They
showed that SC length strongly correlated with crossover frequency and
distribution. Although the length of most of these SCs corresponded to
that predicted from their mitotic chromosome length rank, several SCs
were longer or shorter than expected, with corresponding increases and
decreases in Mlh1 frequency. Although all bivalents shared certain
recombination features, such as few crossovers near the centromeres and
a high rate of distal recombination, individual bivalents had unique
patterns of crossover distribution along their length. In addition to SC
length, other unidentified factors influenced crossover distribution,
leading to hot regions on individual chromosomes with recombination
frequencies as much as 6 times higher than average, as well as coldspots
with no recombination. By reprobing the SC spreads with genetically
mapped BACs, Froenicke et al. (2002) demonstrated a robust strategy for
integrating genetic linkage and physical contig maps with mitotic and
meiotic chromosome structure.

Avdievich et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice with a G67R mutation
in the Mlh1 gene located in 1 of the ATP-binding domains. Although cells
derived from homozygous mice showed defects in DNA repair, the mutation
did not affect the cellular response to DNA damage, including the
apoptotic response of epithelial cells in the intestinal mucosa. The
mice displayed a strong predisposition to cancer but developed
significantly fewer intestinal tumors compared to Mlh1-null mice.
Mlh1-null mice did show defects in the cellular response to DNA damage.
These findings suggested that missense mutations in the Mlh1 gene may
affect MMR tumor suppressor function in a tissue-specific manner. In
addition, homozygous G67R mice were sterile due to the inability of the
mutant protein to interact with meiotic chromosomes at pachynema,
demonstrating that the ATPase activity of Mlh1 is essential for
fertility in mammals.

COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, SER252TER

In a colorectal tumor cell line (H6) (609310) manifesting microsatellite
instability, Papadopoulos et al. (1994) used a technique that involves
the transcription and translation in vitro of PCR products to
demonstrate that only a truncated polypeptide was produced. Sequence
analysis of the cDNA revealed a C-to-A transversion at codon 252,
resulting in the substitution of a stop codon for serine. No band at the
normal C position was identified in the cDNA or genomic DNA from the H6
cells, indicating that these cells were devoid of a wildtype MLH1
allele.

.0002
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, SER44PHE

In a family with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (609310), Bronner
et al. (1994) found that 4 affected individuals were heterozygous for a
C-to-T substitution in an exon encoding amino acids 41 to 69, which
corresponds to a highly conserved region of the protein. The nucleotide
substitution resulted in a ser44-to-phe amino acid change.

MISMATCH REPAIR CANCER SYNDROME
MLH1, 3-BP DEL, LYS618DEL

In a man with mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300), Hamilton et al.
(1995) identified a 3-bp deletion (AAG) in the MLH1 gene, resulting in
the loss of a lysine at codon 618. The patient had adenocarcinomas of
the ascending and transverse colon at the age of 30, adenomas of the
descending and sigmoid colon at the ages of 32 and 33, and an ileal
adenocarcinoma and a glioblastoma multiforme at the age of 33. There was
a family history of HNPCC. The patient was also reported to have a
transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter.

.0004
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, 3.5-KB DEL

Nystrom-Lahti et al. (1995) found that a 3.5-kb genomic deletion in the
MLH1 gene was responsible for 14 of 30 Finnish kindreds meeting
international diagnostic criteria for HNPCC (609310). The origins of the
families were clustered in the south-central region of Finland. The
mutation consisted of exon 15 and the proximal 2.4 kb of intron 15
joined to a distal half of intron 16 followed by intron 17. Introns 15
and 16 were found to be rich in Alu repetitive sequences. Sequence
analysis of the deletion breakpoint region in both mutant and normal
alleles suggested to Nystrom-Lahti et al. (1995) that the deletion may
have been due to recombination between 2 Alu repeat elements, 1 in
intron 15 and another in intron 16.

This large deletion mutation and the splice site mutation leading to
deletion of exon 6 (120436.0005), referred to by Moisio et al. (1996) as
mutations 1 and 2 respectively, are frequent among Finnish kindreds with
HNPCC. In order to assess the ages and origins of these mutations,
Moisio et al. (1996) constructed a map of 15 microsatellite markers
around MLH1 and used this information and haplotype analyses of 19
kindreds with mutation 1 and 6 kindreds with mutation 2. All kindreds
with mutation 1 showed a single allele for the intragenic marker D3S1611
that was not observed on any unaffected chromosome. They also shared
portions of a haplotype of markers encompassing 2.0 to 19.0 cM around
MLH1. All kindreds with mutation 2 shared another allele for D3S1611 and
a conserved haplotype of 5 to 14 markers spanning 2.0 to 15.0 cM around
MLH1. The degree of haplotype conservation was used to estimate the ages
of these 2 mutations. The analyses suggested to the authors that the
spread of mutation 1 started 16 to 43 generations (400 to 1,075 years)
ago and that of mutation 2 started 5 to 21 generations (125 to 525
years) ago. These datings were compatible with genealogic results
identifying a common ancestor born in the 16th and 18th century,
respectively. The results indicated to Moisio et al. (1996) that all
Finnish kindreds studied to date showing either mutation 1 or mutation 2
were the result of single ancestral founding mutations relatively recent
in origin in the population. Alternatively, it is possible that the
mutations arose elsewhere and were introduced into Finland more
recently.

.0005
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, IVS5, G-A, -1

In 5 Finnish families with HNPCC (609310), Nystrom-Lahti et al. (1995)
found that a splice site mutation in the MLH1 gene was responsible. The
mutation consisted of a G-to-A transition in the -1 position of the
splice acceptor site in intron 5. This resulted in deletion of the 92-bp
segment corresponding to exon 6 and caused a frameshift that led to a
premature stop codon 24-bp downstream.

.0006
MUIR-TORRE SYNDROME
MLH1, 370-BP DEL

Muir-Torre syndrome (MRTES; 158320) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by development of sebaceous gland tumors and skin cancers,
including keratoacanthomas and basal cell carcinomas. Affected family
members may manifest a wide spectrum of internal malignancies, which
include colorectal, endometrial, urologic, and upper gastrointestinal
neoplasms. Sebaceous gland tumors, which are rare in the general
population, are considered to be the hallmark of MRTES, and may arise
prior to the development of other visceral cancers. Hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer shares many features in common with
MRTES, leading Lynch et al. (1985) to propose that these 2 syndromes
have a common genetic basis. Bapat et al. (1996) found a mutation in
MLH1 locus in a large, well-characterized kindred in which 17 affected
family members had colorectal and endometrial cancers, sebaceous gland
tumors, and hematopoietic malignancies. The family was originally
reported by Green et al. (1994) who excluded linkage to the MSH2 locus
(609309). Paraf et al. (1995) also described this family. Bapat et al.
(1996) studied 2 affected sibs and found by a protein-truncation test
(PTT) a truncated gene product of approximately 41 kD in addition to the
expected wildtype MLH1 protein of 53.9 kD. Further analysis discovered a
deletion of 370 bp (codons 346-467) corresponding to exon 12 of MLH1
cDNA. An examination of the MLH1 sequence indicated that deletion
generated a frameshift resulting in a stop codon at nucleotides
1472-1474 in exon 13 and a truncated protein of 40.8 kD. Linkage
analysis with an intragenic marker indicated that the affected parent
was heterozygous and the unaffected parent homozygous for the wildtype
allele.

.0007
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, IVS14DS, 7-BP DEL AND 4-BP INS

In 5 of 21 Danish families with HNPCC (609310) satisfying the Amsterdam
criteria, Jager et al. (1997) found a splice-donor mutation in intron 14
of MLH1: a combined 7-bp deletion and 4-bp insertion that led to the
exchange of the obligatory thymidine at position +2 and the exchange of
conserved purines at positions +3 to +5 in the splice donor site. Only 2
of 25 affected individuals suffered from extracolonic cancer. One
patient had endometrial cancer by the age of 33 years and 3 successive
colorectal cancers. The second patient had cancer of the ampulla of
vater by the age of 54 years and 4 colorectal cancers. The phenotype in
the families with the intron 14 mutation corresponded to Lynch syndrome
I. In 4 families with other types of intronic and splice site mutations,
almost 50% of affected individuals had extracolonic tumors corresponding
to Lynch syndrome II. Jager et al. (1997) suggested that clinical
surveillance could be restricted to colonic examinations in HNPCC gene
carriers with monoallelic MLH1 expression.

.0008
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, HIS329PRO

In a family that fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria of HNPCC (609310)
(Vasen et al., 1991), Wang et al. (1997) identified a his329-to-pro
germline mutation. That this mutation was of pathogenetic significance
was proved by finding the same missense mutation as a somatic event
('second hit') in colonic tumors of 2 other HNPCC patients who had
germline mutations at different sites of the MLH1 gene.

.0009
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, 1-BP DEL, 1784T

In a French-Canadian kindred, Yuan et al. (1998) found that a novel
truncating mutation, 1784delT, was associated with HNPCC (609310). The
I1307K APC polymorphism (175100.0029) was also segregating in the
family. This polymorphism, associated with an increased risk of
colorectal cancer, had previously been identified only in individuals of
self-reported Ashkenazi Jewish origin. In the French-Canadian family,
there appeared to be no relationship between the I1307K polymorphism and
the presence or absence of cancer.

COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MISMATCH REPAIR CANCER SYNDROME, INCLUDED
MLH1, ARG226TER

In a hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (609310) family from
Turkey, Ricciardone et al. (1999) identified 3 sibs, born of
consanguineous parents, who developed hematologic malignancy at a very
early age, 2 of whom displayed signs of type I neurofibromatosis (NF1;
162200). Sequence analysis in the 3 sibs demonstrated homozygosity for a
676C-T mutation in the MLH1 gene, leading to an arg226-to-ter mutation
(R226X). Hematologic malignancy was diagnosed in all 3 by the age of 3
years. Both parents had colon cancer at an early age. The phenotype in
the sibs was consistent with the mismatch repair cancer syndrome
(276300), which manifests features of NF1 and hematologic malignancies.

Huang et al. (2001) studied a family with HNPCC in which the proband was
diagnosed with colorectal cancer at the age of 14 years; her mother,
grandmother, and aunt had been diagnosed with HNPCC in their twenties.
DNA sequencing revealed that she was heterozygous for the R226X
mutation. As this mutation is 2 bp from the 3-prime end of exon 8 and
might affect donor splicing, an in vitro transcription translation assay
was performed and confirmed the presence of the truncated peptide, which
lacked the critical PMS2-binding regions at its C terminus.

.0011
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MISMATCH REPAIR CANCER SYNDROME, INCLUDED
MLH1, GLY67TRP

In 2 affected members of a consanguineous North African family in which
11 members of multiple generations developed colorectal cancers
(609310), 8 of them before the age of 50 years, Wang et al. (1999)
identified a heterozygous G-to-T transversion in exon 2 of the MLH1
gene, resulting in a gly67-to-trp (G67W) substitution. Two female
children who were homozygous for the mutation had early onset of
hematologic neoplastic disorders, including undifferentiated non-Hodgkin
malignant lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and a medulloblastoma,
consistent with mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300). In addition,
both sisters had clinical features of type I neurofibromatosis (NF1;
162200): one had multiple but strictly hemicorporal cafe-au-lait macules
and a pseudarthrosis of the tibia, whereas the other had 9 cafe-au-lait
spots. No other family member had NF1.

.0012
RECLASSIFIED - VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
MLH1, LYS618ALA

This variant, formerly titled COLON CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS,
TYPE 2, has been reclassified based on the findings of Kosinski et al.
(2010).

Liu et al. (1999) described 2 germline missense mutations in exon 16 of
the MLH1 gene associated with colorectal cancer (609310): lys618 to ala
and glu578 to gly (120436.0013). The tumors did not show the usual DNA
microsatellite instability (MSI) and would have been missed if this
method was used for selection of patients for mutation screening.

Using in vitro functional expression studies, Kosinski et al. (2010)
demonstrated that the K618A variant was fully expressed and retained MMR
activity, and that PMS2 (600259) was stable. The authors classified
K618A as a variant of uncertain significance rather than as disease
causing.

MLH1, EX16DEL

Vilkki et al. (2001) identified a homozygous deletion of exon 16 of the
MLH1 gene in a 4-year-old girl who died unexpectedly of brain hemorrhage
caused by glioma. She also had cafe-au-lait spots, including multiple
axillary freckles characteristic of NF1 (see 162200) without other
features of NF1. The phenotype in this girl was consistent with the
spectrum of mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300). Both parents, who
had family histories of HNPCC (609310), were heterozygous for the
deletion.

.0015
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, HYPERMETHYLATION

Gazzoli et al. (2002) examined 14 cases suspected to represent
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma (609310) with
microsatellite instability (MSI), but in which no germline MSH2
(609309), MSH6 (600678), or MLH1 mutations were detected, for
hypermethylation of CpG sites in the critical promoter region of MLH1.
The methylation patterns were determined using methylation-specific PCR
and by sequence analysis of sodium bisulfite-treated genomic DNA. In 1
case, DNA hypermethylation of 1 allele was detected in DNA isolated from
blood. In the tumor from this case, which showed high microsatellite
instability, the unmethylated MLH1 allele was eliminated by loss of
heterozygosity, and the methylated allele was retained. This biallelic
inactivation resulted in loss of expression of MLH1 in the tumor as
confirmed by immunohistochemistry. These results suggested a novel mode
of germline inactivation of a cancer susceptibility gene.

Morak et al. (2008) identified hypermethylation of the MLH1 proximal
promoter region in peripheral blood cells of 12 (13%) of 94 unrelated
patients with tumors and loss of MLH1 protein expression without
mutations in the MLH1 gene. Normal colonic tissue, buccal mucosa, and
tumor tissue available from 3 patients also showed abnormal methylation
at the MLH1 promoter. Seven patients who were heterozygous for
informative SNPs showed allele-specific methylation that was not
restricted to either allelic variant. Five patients had about 50%
methylation, consistent with complete methylation of 1 allele. One
patient showed 100% methylation, and the rest showed mosaicism or
incomplete methylation. Hypermethylation was found in 1 mother-son pair,
suggesting familial predisposition for an epimutation. However, there
was no evidence for epigenetic inheritance in the remaining families,
and 6 patients showed a mosaic or incomplete methylation pattern, which
argued against inheritance. Morak et al. (2008) concluded that MLH1
hypermethylation in normal body cells may constitute a pre-lesion, and
that patients with such defects should be under surveillance.

Crepin et al. (2012) identified constitutional MLH1 epimutations in 2
(1.5%) of 134 patients suspected of having Lynch syndrome who did not
have germline mutations in the MMR genes. One patient was a man who
developed colorectal cancer at age 35 years. Tumor tissue showed MSI,
and analysis of lymphocyte DNA showed complete hypermethylation of the
promoter of 1 MLH1 allele. The second patient was a woman with
colorectal cancer, who had a son with colorectal cancer and 2 daughters
with dysplastic colonic polyps. Blood from the mother showed 20%
hypermethylation at the MLH1 promoter, suggesting mosaicism. The son and
1 affected daughter also showed partial hypermethylation in blood,
suggesting transmission of the epimutation through the germline. Tumor
tissue from the 3 patients in the second family also showed partial
hypermethylation at MLH1, with loss of MLH1 expression in 2. Finally,
tumor tissue from the daughter also carried a somatic BRAF mutation
(164757.0001).

.0016
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, -42, C-T

Green et al. (2003) described, in a Newfoundland kindred, the first
report of a heritable MLH1 promoter mutation in HNPCC (609310). The
-42C-T mutation was within a putative Myb protooncogene (189990) binding
site. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they demonstrated
that the mutated Myb binding sequence was less effective in binding
nuclear proteins than the wildtype promoter sequence. Using in vivo
transfection experiments in HeLa cells, they further demonstrated that
the mutated promoter had only 37% of the activity of the wildtype
promoter in driving the expression of a reporter gene. The average age
of onset in 6 family members affected with colorectal cancer was 62
years, which is substantially later than the typical age of onset in
HNPCC families. This finding was considered consistent with the
substantial decrease, but not total elimination, of mismatch repair
function in affected members of this kindred.

.0017
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, THR117MET

The majority of mutations associated with HNPCC occur in the MSH2
(609309) and MLH1 genes (see 120435 and 609310, respectively). Wei et
al. (2003) studied these 2 genes in 15 Taiwanese HNPCC kindreds meeting
the Amsterdam criteria, using both RNA- and DNA-based methods. In the 15
kindreds they found no MSH2 mutations and mutations in MLH1 in 3
kindreds (20%), which is lower than that reported in other countries.
Two novel deletions were found and 1 mutation had been reported several
times in western countries (Maliaka et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1996;
Trojan et al., 2002). A C-to-T transition in codon 117 in exon 4
resulted in an amino acid change from threonine to methionine.

.0018
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, LYS616DEL

In 4 cases of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (609310), Taylor
et al. (2003) found deletion of 3 nucleotides: 1846-1848delAAG resulting
in deletion of lys616 (K616del) from the MLH1 protein. This mutation had
been previously observed by Miyaki et al. (1995). Taylor et al. (2003)
used the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLDA) assay
to demonstrate the deletion.

Tang et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 1846delAAG mutation in
affected members of 5 Taiwanese families with HNPCC2.

.0019
COLORECTAL CANCER, SPORADIC, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MLH1, ASP132HIS

Using a novel high density oligonucleotide array (HNPCC Chip) to look
for variants in the MLH1, MSH2 (609309), and MSH6 (600678) genes in
Israeli probands with familial colorectal cancer (CRC; 114500)
unstratified with respect to the microsatellite instability phenotype,
Lipkin et al. (2004) identified a 415G-C translation in the MLH1 gene,
resulting in an asp132-to-his (D132H) amino acid substitution. MLH1 415C
conferred clinically significant susceptibility to CRC. In contrast to
classic HNPCC, CRCs associated with MLH1 415C usually did not have the
microsatellite instability (MSI) defect, which is important for clinical
mutation screening. Structural and functional analyses showed that the
normal ATPase function of MLH1 was attenuated, but not eliminated, by
the MLH1 415G-C mutation.

COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MISMATCH REPAIR CANCER SYNDROME, INCLUDED
MLH1, PRO648SER

In 8 affected members of a Danish family with HNPCC (609310) reported by
Bisgaard et al. (2002), Raevaara et al. (2004) identified a
pro648-to-ser (P648S) mutation in the MLH1 gene. Only 1 member, a
6-year-old child with first-cousin parents, was homozygous for the
mutation. She had mild features of type I neurofibromatosis (162200) and
no hematologic cancers. She displayed cafe-au-lait spots and a skin
tumor clinically diagnosed as a neurofibroma, but no axillary freckles
or other abnormalities. The phenotype was consistent with the spectrum
of mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300). Raevaara et al. (2004)
commented that the mutated protein was unstable but still functional in
mismatch repair, suggesting that the cancer susceptibility in the family
and possibly also the mild disease phenotype in the homozygous
individual were linked to shortage of the functional protein.

.0021
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, SER269TER

In a 30-year-old patient who had developed colon cancer (609310) at the
age of 22 years, Rey et al. (2004) identified a homozygous 806C-G
transversion in exon 10 of the MLH1 gene, resulting in a ser269-to-thr
(S269T) substitution. Many members of the paternal and maternal families
presented with colon cancer, gastric polyposis, or breast cancer. A
founder effect was proposed because both ancestral families originated
from the same small region in the south of France. A complete MLH1
inactivation was thought to have been responsible for the precocity of
colon cancer and the more aggressive phenotype in this patient.
Relatives could not be studied.

.0022
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, ALA681THR

In a screen of 226 patients from families matching the Amsterdam II
diagnostic criteria or suspected HNPCC criteria for MSH2 (609309) and
MLH1 germline mutations, Kurzawski et al. (2006) found the ala681-to-thr
(A681T) change of MLH1 in 8 Polish families, consistent with HNPCC2
(609310). They concluded that this, the most frequently occurring
mutation of MLH1 in Poland, was a founder mutation. The amino acid
substitution resulted from a 2041G-to-A transition in exon 18.

.0023
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, 3-BP DEL, 213AGA

McVety et al. (2006) demonstrated the presence of an exon splicing
enhancer (ESE) in exon 3 of MLH1 and showed that a 3-bp in-frame
deletion (213_215delAGA) in this ESE was the cause of HNPCC (609310) in
a Quebec family. The deletion resulted in loss of codon 71 and caused
skipping of exon 3 during mRNA splicing.

.0024
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, EX18DEL

In 4 unrelated patients with HNPCC (609310), Pagenstecher et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 2103G-C transversion in the MLH1 gene. The
change was predicted to result in a gln701-to-his (Q701H) substitution,
but RNA analysis showed that it resulted in a splicing defect and
complete loss of exon 18.

.0025
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, EPIGENETICALLY SILENCED

Some epigenetic changes can be transmitted unchanged through the
germline (termed 'epigenetic inheritance'). Evidence that this mechanism
occurs in humans was provided by Suter et al. (2004) by the
identification of individuals in whom 1 allele of the MLH1 gene was
epigenetically silenced throughout the soma (implying a germline event).
These individuals were affected by hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal
cancer but did not have identifiable mutations in MLH1, even though it
was silenced, which demonstrated that an epimutation can phenocopy a
genetic disease.

.0026
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, EPIGENETICALLY SILENCED INHERITED

Hitchins et al. (2007) described a family in which a 66-year-old woman,
the mother of 3 sons by 2 different mates, had the clinical picture of
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. She had metachronous
carcinomas that had microsatellite instability and lacked MLH1
expression. The diagnosis of cancer of the endometrium was made at the
age of 45; of the colon, at age 59; and of the rectum at 60 years. She
was heterozygous for a SNP within the MLH1 promoter (dbSNP rs1800734),
with methylation confined to the A allele. In this woman methylation of
the A allele on approximately 50% of chromosomes was confirmed by
sulfite sequencing. Hitchins et al. (2007) identified an expressible C-T
SNP within MLH1 exon 16 in her son, which was used to demonstrate that
he was transcribing RNA only from the MLH1 allele inherited from his
father. The data were consistent with transmission of the MLH1
epimutation from the proband to her son. In DNA from peripheral blood
leukocytes obtained from this son, approximately half of the MLH1
alleles were methylated. In contrast, his sperm had no trace of MLH1
methylation, despite containing equal proportions of alleles derived
from his father and mother. Furthermore, analysis of the RNA in his
sperm at the MLH1 exon 16 C-T SNP showed reactivation of the maternally
derived MLH1 allele. These results indicated reversion of the MLH1
epimutation to normality during spermatogenesis, suggesting a negligible
risk of transmission from that family member.

In a 4-year-old boy with glioblastoma, nephroblastoma, and cafe-au-lait

MLH1 gene: a 2-bp deletion (593delAG) and a met35-to-asn (M35N;
120436.0028) substitution. Both tumors and normal tissue were negative
for the MLH1 protein. The nephroblastoma showed microsatellite
instability, but the glioblastoma did not. Both parents, who were each
heterozygous for a respective mutation, came from families with HNPCC2

In affected members of a family with HNPCC2 (609310), Clyne et al.
(2009) identified a heterozygous 200G-A transition in exon 2 of the MLH1
gene, resulting in a gly67-to-glu (G67E) substitution. The male proband
had breast cancer, leiomyosarcoma of the thigh, colon cancer, and
prostate cancer. Other relatively unusual tumors in other affected
family members included esophageal cancer, cervical adenosquamous
carcinoma, oligodendroglioma, and prostate cancer. In vitro functional
expression assays in yeast showed that the G67E-mutant protein
interfered with the ability to prevent the accumulation of mutations,
consistent with a loss of function.

the MLH1 gene, resulting in an arg265-to-cys (R265C) substitution. The
mutation was not found in 300 controls. Cancers that occurred included
colon, rectal, gastric, endometrial, ovarian, breast, and others.
Haplotype analysis indicated 2 common haplotypes, 1 of which was shared
by 10 families, suggesting a common origin in China several centuries
ago.

COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, 11.6-KB DEL

In 14 unrelated patients and 95 family members among a series of 84
Lynch syndrome (see 609310) families with germline mutations in MLH1,
MSH2 (609309), or MSH6 (600678), Pinheiro et al. (2011) identified an
identical exonic rearrangement affecting MLH1 and the contiguous LRRFIP2
gene (614043). All 14 probands harbored an 11,627-bp deletion comprising
exons 17 through 19 of the MLH1 gene and exons 26 through 29 of the
LRRFIP2 gene. The 5-prime and 3-prime breakpoints were located 280 bp
downstream of MLH1 exon 16 and 678 bp upstream of LRRFIP2 exon 25,
respectively (Chr3: 37.089-37.101 Mb, GRCh37). The mutation was
therefore designated 1896+280_oLRRFIP2:1750-678del. This mutation
represented 17% of all deleterious mismatch repair mutations in their
series. Haplotype analysis showed a conserved region of approximately 1
Mb, and the mutation age was estimated to be 283 +/- 78 years, or to the
beginning of the 18th century. All 14 families originated from the Porto
district countryside. Pinheiro et al. (2011) recommended using this
mutation as first line screening for Lynch syndrome among families of
Portuguese descent.

COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, IVS3DS, G-A, +5

In 17 Spanish families originating from northern Spain with HNPCC2
(609310), Borras et al. (2010) identified a G-to-A transition in intron
3 of the MLH1 gene (306+5G-A). RT-PCR on patient lymphocytes showed an
aberrant mRNA transcript expected to generate a truncated protein. This
transcript was associated with an increased amount of a transcript
corresponding to the in-frame skipping of exon 3. Although the variant
is pathogenic at the RNA level, neither abnormal bands nor differences
in protein expression were observed in lymphocytes from carriers,
suggesting that the mutant protein was unstable. By age 70, the lifetime
risk of colorectal cancer in carriers was estimated at 20.1% in men and
14.1% in women. A common haplotype was identified, consistent with a
founder effect, and the age of the mutation was estimated to be from 53
to 122 generations.

.0033
COLORECTAL CANCER, HEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS, TYPE 2
MLH1, LEU622HIS

In 12 Spanish families originating from southern Spain with HNPCC2
(609310), Borras et al. (2010) identified a 1865T-A transversion in the
MLH1 gene, resulting in a leu622-to-his (L622H) substitution in a highly
conserved residue at the interaction domain for MutL. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the substitution resulted in
decreased amounts of the MLH1 protein. Five of 6 tumors analyzed lost
the MLH1 wildtype allele, suggesting a growth advantage with loss of the
wildtype protein. By age 70, the lifetime risk of colorectal cancer in
carriers was estimated at 6.8% in men and 7.26% in women. A common
haplotype was identified, consistent with a founder effect, and the age
of the mutation was estimated to be from 12 to 22 generations.

.0034
MISMATCH REPAIR CANCER SYNDROME
MLH1, LEU73ARG

In a boy with mismatch repair cancer syndrome (276300), Baas et al.
(2013) identified a homozygous 218T-to-G transversion in exon 3 of the
MLH1 gene, resulting in a leu73-to-arg (L73R) substitution. His parents
were unrelated, but originated from the same Polynesian Pacific Island
population. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein had no DNA repair activity. The patient first presented
with a glioblastoma multiforme and later developed a T-cell
lymphoblastic lymphoma. He died of sepsis at the end of treatment. Brain
imaging showed near complete agenesis of the corpus callosum,
interhemispheric and intracerebral cysts, and right subcortical and
periventricular heterotopia. He was also noted to have multiple
cafe-au-lait spots. The maternal family history was positive for
colorectal cancer.

301040	TITLE #301040 ALPHA-THALASSEMIA/MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME, X-LINKED; ATRX
;;ALPHA-THALASSEMIA/MENTAL RETARDATION SYNDROME, NONDELETION TYPE;;
ATR-X SYNDROME;;
ATR, NONDELETION TYPE
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because the phenotype is
caused by mutation in the ATRX gene (300032).

The 'deletion' type of alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome
(141750) is a contiguous gene syndrome due to a deletion in chromosome
16p that involves the hemoglobin alpha-1 (HBA1; 141800) and alpha-2
(HBA2; 141850) genes.

The X-linked mental retardation-hypotonic facies syndrome (309580) is
also caused by mutation in the ATRX gene.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Weatherall et al. (1981) reported the association of hemoglobin H
disease (Hb H; see alpha-thalassemias, 141800) and mental retardation in
3 unrelated patients of northern European descent.

Wilkie et al. (1990) reported 5 unrelated patients, 2 of whom were
reported by Weatherall et al. (1981), with mental retardation and
alpha-thalassemia without molecular abnormalities of the alpha-globin
gene complex on chromosome 16p. The patients showed a strikingly uniform
phenotype comprising severe mental handicap, characteristic dysmorphic
facies, genital abnormalities, and an unusual, mild form of hemoglobin H
disease. Facial features included microcephaly, hypertelorism,
epicanthus, a small triangular upturned nose, and flat face. The degree
of red blood cell hypochromia and Hb H levels, which varied from 0.7 to
6.7%, were milder than usually found in alpha-thalassemia. Although
several approaches failed to find a defect in the alpha-globin genes, 3
patients tested had markedly reduced total mRNA levels of both HBA1 and
HBA2. The authors suggested that the responsible locus encoded a
trans-acting factor involved in the normal regulation of alpha-globin
expression.

Harvey et al. (1990) described the syndrome in a 21-year-old male and
his brother who had died earlier, suggesting X-linked inheritance. DNA
analysis showed no deletions within the alpha-globin gene cluster. Hb H
bodies were present at a low level (1.6%).

Porteous and Burn (1990) described a 6-year-old boy who had a maternal
uncle with an X-linked mental retardation syndrome, and suggested that
their case resembled 2 brothers previously thought to have an atypical
form of the Coffin-Lowry syndrome (303600) (illustrated in Smith's
Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation, Jones, 1988). However,
Wilkie et al. (1991) found that there were hematologic signs of the
nondeletion ATR syndrome in the patient reported by Porteous and Burn
(1990). In addition, Wilkie et al. (1991) reported that hematologic
evaluation of 1 of the brothers reported in Smith's book showed that he
had nondeletion ATR and that a male first-cousin through the maternal
line had the same condition. Wilkie et al. (1991) suggested that this
condition be called 'X-linked alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation'
(ATR-X) to distinguish it from the deletion form.

In a review, Gibbons et al. (1991) noted that some patients with ATR-X
syndrome have normal or only mildly abnormal hematologic indices; thus
normal hemoglobin levels and red cell indices do not necessarily exclude
the condition.

Cole et al. (1991) described an affected boy whose maternal uncle was
also affected. The boy had right-sided renal agenesis with left-sided
hydronephrosis and hydroureter. He had recurrent hypochromic, microcytic
anemia. His otherwise unaffected sister had had recurrent urinary tract
infections and persistent renal impairment in the absence of any
identifiable renal tract anomaly. Kurosawa et al. (1996) described a boy
with self-induced vomiting followed by rumination and noted that Cole et
al. (1991) made the same observation in a man and his nephew.

Donnai et al. (1991) described 4 brothers with this syndrome in whom the
diagnosis was first suspected because of their characteristic clinical
features and was confirmed in each case by the demonstration of Hb H
inclusions in a proportion of their red blood cells. Very rare Hb H
inclusions were found in the red blood cells of the mother and one
sister who both shared some facial features with the affected boys; they
were presumed to be carriers of the disorder.

Gorlin (1993) examined patients with typical features of the ATR-X
syndrome, but without hemoglobin H. The facies were identical and
mapping studies in several families suggested location of the mutation
in the site on the X chromosome involved in ATR-X. The facies of this
syndrome, which is often confused with that of Coffin-Lowry syndrome,
were marked by telecanthus, epicanthic folds, flat nasal bridge, midface
hypoplasia, a carp-shaped mouth with full lips, and small triangular
nose with anteverted nostrils. Gorlin (1993) noted that the alae of the
nose extended lower than the columella and septum. All developmental
milestones, especially walking, were delayed and speech was almost
absent. On further investigation, Gibbons (1994) found that the patients
of Gorlin (1993) did have alpha-thalassemia, as indicated by the
presence of hemoglobin H inclusions after use of 1% brilliant cresyl
blue staining overnight in buffered solution at room temperature. With
the staining, the Hb H inclusions give the erythrocytes the appearance
of golf balls.

Logie et al. (1994) reported a pedigree with 6 affected males in 4
sibships spanning 2 generations. Two affected cousins were described in
detail, one of whom had an unusually mild hematologic phenotype. Hb H
inclusions, the hallmark of the disorder, were detected in the
peripheral red blood cells only after repeated observations. The cousins
had strikingly similar facies with telecanthus, anteverted nares,
carp-shaped mouth, and large tongue. Gibbons et al. (1995) showed that
the hematologic findings in ATR-X may vary widely; indeed, in some
cases, the manifestation of alpha-thalassemia may be subtle and missed
without repeated examinations. McPherson et al. (1995) described a
kindred with 4 affected members. The hematologic abnormality was not
detected on routine hematologic studies, including hemoglobin
electrophoresis, but the patients were found to have hemoglobin H
inclusions on brilliant cresyl blue staining of peripheral smears.

Reardon et al. (1995) reported 2 phenotypic females with a 46,XY
karyotype who had abnormalities of the external genitalia resulting in
male pseudohermaphroditism. They pointed out that 1 of the 5 original
patients described in defining the ATR-X syndrome was a phenotypic
female with a 46,XY karyotype (Wilkie et al., 1990). McPherson et al.
(1995) described genital anomalies that led to a female sex of rearing
in 3 of 4 affected members of a family. Gibbons et al. (1995) emphasized
the progressive coarsening of the facial appearance. Kuno et al. (1997)
described a 5-year-old Japanese boy with this condition. He had an
abnormal hemoglobin which was found to consist exclusively of a beta
subunit. Severe mental retardation and hypoplastic penis and testes were
present. Anemia was only mild (hematocrit 35.8%). The family history was
unremarkable.

Martinez et al. (1998) reported 2 brothers and 1 maternal cousin with
severe mental retardation, microcephaly, short stature, cryptorchidism,
and spastic diplegia. Some facial dysmorphic features were present.
Martinez et al. (1998) pointed out the similarity in phenotype between
their family and that described by Sutherland et al. (1988) (see
309500). They suggested that the greater phenotypic severity in their
family was due to allelic heterogeneity. X-inactivation analysis of 1
potential and 3 obligate carriers showed nonrandom inactivation of the
disease-linked variant. On further analysis of this family, Lossi et al.
(1999) found that 3% of the patients' erythrocytes showed Hb H
inclusions, consistent with ATR-X. Lossi et al. (1999) also reported
dysmorphic facial features, including 'carp-like' triangular mouth,
hypertelorism, small triangular nose, and broad nasal root. The
hypertonia and spasticity were unusual findings in this family. A
mutation was found in the ATRX gene in affected individuals
(300032.0016).

Gibbons and Higgs (2000) provided a review of the clinical spectrum of
syndromes caused by mutation in the XH2 gene.

Martucciello et al. (2006) described male 3-year-old dizygotic twins
with ATRX who exhibited gastrointestinal problems including severe
regurgitation of food, vomiting, dysphagia, irritability, respiratory
disorders, meteorism, and chronic constipation. Barium studies in both
twins showed gastric pseudovolvulus, and 24-hour pH monitoring showed
severe gastroesophageal reflux. Enzymo-histochemical studies of
full-thickness colonic biopsies revealed a complex dysganglionosis:
ultrashort Hirschsprung disease (see 142623) associated with
hypoganglionosis. Martucciello et al. (2006) reviewed the
gastrointestinal phenotype of 128 confirmed cases of ATRX and found that
drooling was reported in 36% of cases, gastroesophageal reflux was
present in 72%, and constipation in 30%. Fundoplication was performed in
10% of cases, and 9% were fed by gastrostomy. Upper GI bleeding was
reported in 10% of cases. Fatal aspiration of vomitus occurred in 3
patients; volvulus was seen in 4 patients, 2 of whom died after
intestinal infarction; and 4 patients had recurrent hospitalizations for
ileus or pseudoobstruction. Martucciello et al. (2006) also noted that
there were numerous anecdotal reports from parents describing prolonged
episodes of patient distress with refusal to eat or drink.

Jezela-Stanek et al. (2009) reported a patient with ATRX confirmed by
genetic analysis. He had hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, strabismus,
short nose with flat bridge and triangular upturned tip, and tented
upper lip with everted lower lip. Other features included hypotonia,
psychomotor retardation, and hemoglobin H inclusions. The patient also
had undescended testes and ambiguous genitalia, which the authors
referred to as male pseudohermaphroditism. Laboratory studies showed
increased FSH and decreased testosterone. A deceased sib was believed to
have been affected and reportedly had ambiguous external genitalia.
Jezela-Stanek et al. (2009) postulated that the distinctive facial
features in ATRX result from facial hypotonia and can be confused with
Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS; 303600) or SLO syndromes (SLOS; 270400).

- Carrier Females

Studying 7 pedigrees that included individuals with the ATR-X syndrome,
Gibbons et al. (1992) concluded that intellectually normal female
carriers could be identified by the presence of rare cells containing Hb
H inclusions in their peripheral blood and by an extremely skewed
pattern of X inactivation in cells from a variety of tissues. McPherson
et al. (1995) used a combination of skewed X inactivation and haplotype
analysis at Xq12-q21.3 to establish carrier status.

Wada et al. (2005) found skewed X-inactivation patterns (greater than
90:10) in 6 of 7 unaffected Japanese female ATR-X carriers; the 1
carrier with non-skewed X inactivation (72:28) demonstrated moderate
mental retardation. The woman did not have dysmorphic features or
hemoglobin inclusions. Wada et al. (2005) concluded that mutations in
the ATRX gene may cause mental retardation in females if the chromosome
carrying the mutation is not properly inactivated.

Badens et al. (2006) reported a 4-year-old girl with typical features of
the ATR-X syndrome. Molecular studies showed a totally skewed
X-inactivation pattern, with the active chromosome carrying a
heterozygous mutation in the ATRX gene (300032.0018). Neither parent had
the mutation in peripheral blood leukocytes, but SNP analysis indicated
that the mutation occurred on the maternal chromosome. The child was
conceived with assisted reproduction technologies (ART) due to
micropolycystic ovaries and endometriosis in the mother. Badens et al.
(2006) suggested that some aspect of ART may have disturbed imprinting
in this patient.

MAPPING

By linkage analysis of 7 affected pedigrees, Gibbons et al. (1992)
mapped the ATR-X locus to an 11-cM interval on chromosome Xq12-q21.31
between markers DXS106 and DXYS1X (peak lod score of 5.4 at theta = 0 at
DXS72).

In a 3-generation ATR-X family with 3 affected males, Houdayer et al.
(1993) demonstrated a maximum lod score of 2.09 at a recombination
fraction of zero for linkage with DXS453 located at the boundary
Xq12-q13.1. The nearest flanking loci demonstrating recombination with
the disease locus were the androgen receptor (AR; 313700) at Xq11.2-q12
on the centromeric side and DXS72 at Xq21.1 on the telomeric side.
Houdayer et al. (1993) interpreted their results as compatible with a
distal boundary at Xq21.1 instead of Xq21.31 as previously held.

Gibbons et al. (1995) performed linkage analysis in 9 families with
ATR-X syndrome and identified key recombinants that reduced the area of
interest to 1.4 cM (estimated to be 15 Mb) between DXS454 and DXS72
within Xq13.1-q21.1 (Wang et al., 1994).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with the ATR-X syndrome, Gibbons et al. (1995) identified
mutations in the ATRX gene (300032.0001-300032.0009).

In affected members of a family with ATR-X syndrome, Villard et al.
(1996) identified a splice site mutation in the ATRX gene (300032.0010).
In 2 first cousins presenting the classic ATR-X phenotype with
alpha-thalassemia and Hb H inclusions, only the abnormal transcript was
expressed. In a distant cousin presenting with a similar dysmorphic
mental retardation phenotype, but without thalassemia, they found that
approximately 30% of the ATRX transcripts were normal. These data
suggested that the mode of action of the ATRX gene product on globin
expression is distinct from its mode of action in brain development and
facial morphogenesis, and that the mutated splice site could be used
with varying efficiency in different individuals.

Hendrich and Bickmore (2001) reviewed human disorders that share in
common defects of chromatin structure or modification, including the
ATR-X spectrum of disorders, ICF syndrome (242860), Rett syndrome
(312750), Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (180849), and Coffin-Lowry syndrome.

- Partial Duplication of the ATRX Gene

Thienpont et al. (2007) reported 3 patients, including 2 sibs, with the
ATRX syndrome due to partial duplications of the ATRX gene. In 1 family,
the duplication included exons 2 to 35; in the other family, exons 2 to
29. Further analysis showed that both mothers carried the duplication
and both had skewed X inactivation. In 1 patient, ATRX mRNA levels were
about 3% of normal values. Thienpont et al. (2007) noted that the
duplications were not identified by sequence analysis and suggested that
quantitative analysis to detect copy numbers of the ATRX gene may be
required in some cases.

Cohn et al. (2009) reported a family in which 3 males had ATRX syndrome
due to a partial intragenic duplication of the ATRX gene that spanned
exons 2 to 31. Northern blot analysis failed to identify a full-length
transcript, but cDNA sequencing was consistent with some level of
expression. The authors noted that complete loss of ATRX is most likely
lethal, suggesting that the mutation was likely hypomorphic and
associated with some residual protein function. Unaffected obligate
carrier females in the family had highly skewed X inactivation. The
phenotype was typical for the disorder, although the facial features
were not as readily apparent in the 2 older affected individuals. The
proband was identified from 2 larger cohorts comprising 300 males with
mental retardation. Cohn et al. (2009) did not find ATRX duplications in
29 additional males with ATRX syndrome who were negative on sequence
analysis, suggesting that duplications are a rare cause of the disorder.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In a review article, Gibbons and Higgs (2000) noted that mutations in
the ATRX gene resulting in the loss of the C terminal domain are
associated with the most severe urogenital abnormalities. However, at
other sites, there is no obvious link between genotype and phenotype,
and there is considerable variation in the degree of abnormalities seen
in individuals with the same mutation.

Among 22 ATRX patients from 16 families, Badens et al. (2006) found that
those with mutations in the PHD-like domain of the ATRX protein had
significantly more severe and permanent psychomotor retardation and
significantly more severe urogenital anomalies compared to those with
mutations in the helicase domain.

ANIMAL MODEL

Medina et al. (2009) surveyed ATR-X syndrome clinical findings and noted
that ocular defects were present in 47 (23%) of 202 patients. They
showed that Atrx was expressed in the neuroprogenitor pool in embryonic
mouse retina and in all cell types of adult mouse retina except rod
photoreceptors. Conditional inactivation of Atrx in mouse retina during
embryogenesis resulted in loss of only 2 types of neurons, amacrine and
horizontal cells. This defect did not arise from a failure to specify
these cells, but rather a defect in interneuron differentiation and
survival postnatally. The timing of cell loss was concomitant with
light-dependent changes in synaptic organization in mouse retina and
with a change in Atrx subnuclear localization within these interneurons.
The interneuron defects were associated with functional deficits as
demonstrated by reduced b-wave amplitudes upon electroretinogram
analysis. Medina et al. (2009) proposed a role for Atrx in interneuron
survival and differentiation.

107710	TITLE *107710 APOLIPOPROTEIN C-I; APOC1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tata et al. (1985) synthesized a mixed oligonucleotide 17 bases long and
used it to isolate cDNA clones for apoC-I from an adult liver cDNA
library.

MAPPING

Tata et al. (1985) used a probe and Southern blot techniques to identify
the human APOC1 gene in the DNA of various human-rodent cell hybrids.
Their results assigned the gene to chromosome 19.

By the study of somatic cell hybrids containing rearranged chromosome
19, Scott et al. (1985) concluded that the chromosome 19 cluster of
apolipoprotein genes probably lies in the 19p13-19cen region. (HGM8
placed the cluster in the 19cen-19q13 region.) Davison et al. (1986)
showed that there are 2 APOC1 sequences on chromosome 19 and that 1 of
them is 4 kb 3-prime to apolipoprotein E (APOE; 107741) and oriented in
the same way as APOE. One APOC1 gene appeared to be a pseudogene because
no mRNA product could be detected in any tissue (Lauer et al., 1988).
There are 2 APOC1 mRNA transcripts, but these may be the consequence of
differential processing of a single primary transcript.

Lusis et al. (1986) used a reciprocal whole arm translocation between
the long arm of chromosome 19 and the short arm of chromosome 1 to
determine that the APOC1, APOC2, APOE and GPI loci are on the long arm
and the LDLR, C3 and PEPD loci on the short arm. They isolated a single
lambda phage carrying APOC1 and part of APOE. These genes are 6 kb apart
and arranged tandemly. APOC2 and APOE were previously shown to be
tightly linked. Studying a cDNA APOC1 clone and a genomic APOE clone,
Myklebost and Rogne (1986) concluded that the loci are 4.3 kb apart. By
comparison, on chromosome 11, APOA1 (107680) is 2.6 kb from APOC3
(107720). Using separate probes for each locus, Bailey and Miller (1987)
mapped APOC2 and APOE to 19q13.1 at the border of q12 by in situ
hybridization.

Smit et al. (1988) presented a map of the apolipoprotein E-C1-C2 gene
cluster on chromosome 19: 5-prime--APOE--4.3 kb--APOC1--6 kb--APOC1
pseudogene--about 22 kb--APOC2--3-prime. Thus, the cluster spans
approximately 48 kb. This gene order and the size of the cluster were
confirmed by Myklebost and Rogne (1988) by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis mapping methods. A HpaI RFLP in the APOE-C1-C2 gene
cluster on chromosome 19 is strongly associated with familial
dysbetalipoproteinemia. Smit et al. (1988) showed that this RFLP site is
between APOE and APOC1 and specifically that it is located 317 bp
upstream of the transcription initiation site of the APOC1 gene. They
constructed a detailed restriction map of the gene cluster, showing that
the APOC2 gene is located 15 kb downstream of the APOC1 pseudogene.
Although Trask et al. (1993) did not map the APOC1 gene directly, the
mapping of the APOE and APOC2 genes to 19q13.2 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization established that the APOC1 gene is also in this band.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) is a designation used to define
the nondemented elderly with subjective and objective memory impairment
presenting no medical or other psychopathologic conditions that could
explain the memory problems (Crook et al., 1986). Bartres-Faz et al.
(2001) noted that it was controversial whether AAMI described a subgroup
of normally aging subjects or, on the other hand, whether these
individuals presented particular characteristics distinguishable from
controls or an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia.
Because an association between an APOE polymorphism (APOE*E4;
107741.0016) and late-onset Alzheimer disease (104310) had been
convincingly confirmed in several reports, they studied the distribution
of genetic polymorphisms in the APOE and APOC1 genes in a sample of 100
subjects fulfilling the National Institute of Mental Health criteria for
age-associated memory impairment and in 124 controls. They found
significant associations for both APOE and APOC1 and their combinations
with the AAMI condition.

ANIMAL MODEL

To determine the relationship between APOC1 and CETP (118470), Gautier
et al. (2002) crossed transgenic mice expressing human CETP with Apoc1
null mice. The high density lipoproteins (HDLs) of these crosses
contained 50% less cholesteryl esters and showed a decreased cholesteryl
ester-to-triglyceride ratio. The mean apparent diameter of LDLs from
these mice was also significantly reduced. In vitro, purified Apoc1
inhibited cholesteryl ester exchange when added to either total plasma
or to reconstituted HDL-free mixtures. Gautier et al. (2002) concluded
that APOC1 is a specific inhibitor of CETP.

Jong et al. (1999) found that adenovirus-delivery of LDLR (606945) to
transgenic mice overexpressing Apoc1 resulted in decreased plasma lipid
levels. Infection with VLDLR (192977) had no effect. These results,
coupled with in vitro binding studies, suggested that APOC1 inhibits the
clearance of lipoprotein particles via VLDLR, but APOC1-enriched
lipoproteins can still bind to LDLR.

603110	TITLE *603110 MOTHERS AGAINST DECAPENTAPLEGIC, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 5; SMAD5
;;MADH5;;
SMA- AND MAD-RELATED PROTEIN 5
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Drosophila Mad transduces signals from TGF-beta (e.g., 190180) family
members. By searching an expressed sequence tag (EST) database with the
protein sequences of Mad and Mad homologs, Riggins et al. (1996)
isolated partial human cDNAs encoding MADH5, which they called JV5-1.
The deduced MADH5 protein has 465 amino acids, with 57 of the C-terminal
59 residues identical to those of Mad.

Gemma et al. (1998) determined the full-length cDNA sequence of human
MADH5, which they called SMAD5. Using PCR-SSCP analysis to investigate
the frequency of SMAD5 somatic mutations in human cancers, Gemma et al.
(1998) did not detect either homozygous deletions or point mutations in
40 primary gastric tumors or 51 cell lines derived from diverse types of
cancer, including 20 cell lines resistant to the growth inhibitory
effects of TGF-beta. The SMAD5 protein has strong homology with SMAD1
(601595), SMAD2 (601366), SMAD3 (603109), and SMAD4 (600993) in the N-
and C-terminal domains, which are separated by a proline-rich sequence;
SMAD5 shows the greatest homology to SMAD1.

GENE FUNCTION

Bruno et al. (1998) showed that SMAD5 plays a critical role in the
signaling pathway by which TGF-beta inhibits the proliferation of human
hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta and bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMPs; see 112264) is mediated by miR21 (611020).
miR21 downregulates PDCD4 (608610), which in turn acts as a negative
regulator of smooth muscle contractile genes. TGF-beta and BMP signaling
promoted a rapid increase in expression of mature miR21 through a
posttranscriptional step, promoting the processing of primary
transcripts of miR21 (pri-miR21) into precursor miR21 (pre-miR21) by the
Drosha complex (see 608828). TGF-beta and BMP-specific SMAD signal
transducers SMAD1, SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD5 (603110) are recruited to
pri-miR21 in a complex with the RNA helicase p68 (DDX5; 180630), a
component of the Drosha microprocessor complex. The shared cofactor
SMAD4 (600993) is not required for this process. Thus, Davis et al.
(2008) concluded that regulation of microRNA biogenesis by
ligand-specific SMAD proteins is critical for control of the vascular
smooth muscle cell phenotype and potentially for SMAD4-independent
responses mediated by the TGF-beta and BMP signaling pathways.

GENE STRUCTURE

By comparison of the SMAD5 cDNA sequence with the SMAD5 genomic
sequence, obtained from YAC clones, Gemma et al. (1998) showed that the
SMAD5 gene has 8 exons, with the coding sequence contained in exons 3 to
8. By 5-prime RACE, the authors identified a SMAD5 cDNA derived from an
alternatively spliced transcript that lacks the 75-bp exon 2.

MAPPING

Riggins et al. (1996) mapped the MADH5 gene to 5q31 by somatic cell
hybrid analysis and screening of YAC clones.

603895	TITLE *603895 REGULATOR OF G PROTEIN SIGNALING 11; RGS11
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) family act as
GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) on the alpha subunits of
heterotrimeric, signal-transducing G proteins. As such, RGS proteins can
serve as negative regulators of G protein-mediated signaling pathways by
speeding the inactivation of GTP-bound G-alpha subunits.

CLONING

Snow et al. (1998) identified sequences encoding human RGS11 by database
searches. The predicted 467-amino acid human protein contains a DEP
(Dishevelled, EGL-10, pleckstrin) domain and an RGS domain. In addition,
sequence analysis revealed that RGS11, RGS6 (603894), RGS7 (602517),
RGS9, and C. elegans EGL-10 all contain a conserved 64-amino acid region
that the authors called a GGL (G protein gamma subunit-like) domain
because of its similarity to G protein gamma subunits (see 600874). In
vitro, the GGL domains of RGS11 and RGS7 interact preferentially with
the G protein beta-5 subunit. Coexpression of RGS11 with different
G-beta subunits indicated that RGS11 interacted specifically with
G-beta-5 in mammalian cells. The G-beta-5/RGS11 heterodimer acted as a
GAP on G-0-alpha (139311) in vitro. Northern blot analysis revealed that
RGS11 and G-beta-5 are expressed in overlapping patterns, with the
highest levels of RGS11 mRNA observed in brain and retina.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sierra et al. (2002) determined that the RGS11 gene contains 16 exons
and spans 8.1 kb.

MAPPING

By inclusion within mapped clones, Snow et al. (1998) mapped the RGS11
gene to 16p13.3.

114830	TITLE *114830 CARBONYL REDUCTASE 1; CBR1
;;CARBONYL REDUCTASE; CBR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Carbonyl reductase (EC 1.1.1.184) is 1 of several monomeric,
NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases having wide specificity for carbonyl
compounds that are generally referred to as aldo-keto reductases. Others
include aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2; 103830) and aldose reductase (EC
1.1.1.21; 103880).

CLONING

Wermuth et al. (1988) isolated and characterized a cDNA complementary to
carbonyl reductase mRNA from a human placenta cDNA library. The cDNA
contained an open reading frame encoding a protein comprised of 277
amino acids with a molecular weight of 30,375. Comparison of the
predicted protein sequence with the primary structures of other
aldo-keto reductases showed no significant homologies. A possible
homology, on the other hand, was found between carbonyl reductase and
'short' subunit alcohol/polyol dehydrogenases. The enzyme is widely
distributed in human tissues and also occurs in other mammalian and
nonmammalian species.

In a carbonyl reductase cDNA cloned from a breast cancer cell line,
Forrest et al. (1990) demonstrated 1,219 basepairs. Southern analysis of
genomic DNA digested with several restriction enzymes and analyzed by
hybridization with a labeled cDNA probe indicated that carbonyl
reductase is probably coded by a single gene and does not belong to a
family of structurally similar enzymes. Carbonyl reductase mRNA was
induced 3- or 4-fold in 24 hours with BHA, beta-naphthoflavone, or Sudan
1.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of 17 mouse/human somatic cell hybrids,
Forrest et al. (1990) showed that the CBR gene is located on chromosome
21.

Avramopoulos et al. (1992) confirmed assignment to chromosome 21 by
genetic linkage mapping using a DNA polymorphism from the 3-prime
untranslated region of the CBR gene. They demonstrated, furthermore,
that the gene lies between the interferon-alpha receptor gene (107450)
and D21S55, being about 3.4 and 7.2 cM, respectively, from the 2
flanking loci. The findings placed CBR in the telomeric band 21q22.3.

By high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization, Lemieux et al.
(1993) mapped the CBR gene to 21q22.12, very close to the SOD1 locus at
position 21q22.11. CBR displayed gene dosage effects in trisomy 21 human
lymphoblasts at both the DNA and the mRNA levels. With increasing
chromosome 21 ploidy, lymphoblasts also showed increased aldo-keto
reductase activity and increased quinone reductase activity. Both of
these activities have been shown to be associated with carbonyl
reductase. The location of CBR near SOD1 and the increased enzyme
activity and potential for free radical modulation in trisomy 21 cells
implicate CBR as a candidate for contributing to the pathology of Down
syndrome.

Wei et al. (1996) mapped the mouse Cbr1 gene to distal chromosome 16, as
had others. They identified a second carbonyl reductase gene in mouse
(Cbr2) and found that it mapped to distal chromosome 11.

GENE STRUCTURE

By sequence analysis of human chromosome region 21q22.2, Watanabe et al.
(1998) determined that the CBR1 gene contains 3 exons and spans 3.3 kb.
They identified a related gene, CBR3 (603608), 62 kb telomeric to CBR1.

GENE FUNCTION

Carbonyl reductase catalyzes the reduction of a great variety of
carbonyl compounds, e.g., quinones derived from polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, 9-ketoprostaglandins, and the antitumor anthracycline
antibiotics daunorubicin and doxorubicin (Wermuth et al., 1988).

NUCLEAR FACTOR ASSOCIATED WITH DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA; NFAR
DESCRIPTION For background information, see NF45 (ILF2; 603181).

CLONING

Kao et al. (1994) cloned cDNAs encoding NF45 and NF90. The NF90 gene
encodes a 671-amino acid polypeptide with limited similarity to several
RNA-binding proteins. The NF90 gene also appears to encode an
alternatively spliced 404-amino acid polypeptide, of which the first 394
amino acids are identical to the longer clone. Northern and Western blot
analysis demonstrated NF45 and NF90 expression in several cell types,
including both unstimulated and stimulated Jurkat T cells.

By immunoscreening a HeLa cell cDNA library for phosphoproteins,
Matsumoto-Taniura et al. (1996) isolated a partial cDNA encoding ILF3,
which they termed MPP4. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that MPP4
encodes 90- and 110-kD proteins. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated cytoplasmic expression during M phase and nuclear/nucleolar
expression during interphase.

Patel et al. (1999) purified double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding
proteins from HeLa cell extracts and microsequenced a 90-kD protein with
identity to MPP4 in its N terminus. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with a
mutant RNA-activated protein kinase (PRKR; 176871) as bait, followed by
RT-PCR, they isolated a full-length cDNA encoding ILF3, which they
called DRBP76. Sequence analysis predicted that the 702-amino acid
protein has a bipartite nuclear localization signal, 2 dsRNA-binding
domains, an RG2 domain, and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a 90-kD protein, larger than the
calculated 76 kD. EMSA analysis confirmed the dsRNA binding activity of
DRBP76. Autoradiographic analysis indicated that DRBP76 is
phosphorylated by PRKR.

Langland et al. (1999) noted that NF90 is primarily localized to
ribosomes.

Saunders et al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding DRBP76, which they
termed NFAR1, as well as a variant cDNA encoding a 110-kD, 894-amino
acid protein they designated NFAR2. Sequence analysis showed that the
NFAR proteins share homology with a known PRKR substrate, the
translation initiation factor EIF2S1 (603907). Northern blot analysis
revealed ubiquitous expression of multiple transcripts ranging from 4.0
to 8.0 kb. Immunoblot analysis indicated variable expression with lower
amounts particularly notable in liver and spleen, suggesting
differential regulation at the translational or posttranslational level.
Immunoblot analysis and confocal microscopy demonstrated that PRKR and
both NFAR variants reciprocally coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize in
the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated an association with
spliceosomes.

Viranaicken et al. (2006) identified splice variants of human and mouse
ILF3 that encode long and short isoforms of the ILF3 and NF90 proteins
via inclusion or exclusion of 13 N-terminal residues, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Kao et al. (1994) showed that the NF45 and NF90 proteins form an NFAT
DNA-binding activity that is enhanced by T-cell stimulation and
inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506.

Functional analysis by Saunders et al. (2001) indicated that both NFAR
proteins regulate gene transcription, probably at the level of mRNA
elongation. NFAR2 exhibited potent, constitutive regulatory activity
through its unique C-terminal region, which specifically interacted with
FUS (137070) and SMN1 (600354). Saunders et al. (2001) concluded that
NFARs facilitate dsRNA-regulated gene expression at the level of
posttranscription.

Shim et al. (2002) showed that NF90 binds to a subregion of the 3-prime
untranslated region that contains several AU-rich elements (AREs) and
slows down the degradation of IL2 (147680) mRNA. In nonstimulated cells,
NF90 was mostly nuclear, but T-cell activation resulted in its
accumulation in the cytoplasm. The authors concluded that nuclear export
of NF90 is required for IL2 mRNA stabilization.

Pfeifer et al. (2008) found that NFAR1 and NFAR2 were involved in
retaining cellular transcripts in intranuclear foci and could regulate
mRNA export to the cytoplasm. They also remained associated with
exported ribonucleoprotein complexes. Treatment of HeLa cells with small
interfering RNA to NFAR1 and/or NFAR2 resulted in an increase in protein
synthesis rates, particularly in the presence the mRNA export factors
TAP (NXF1; 602647), p15 (NXT1; 605811), or RAE1 (603343). Depletion of
NFAR in mouse fibroblasts or HeLa cells dramatically increased their
susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis virus or influenza virus,
respectively. Pfeifer et al. (2008) concluded that NFAR1 and NFAR2 are
retained on polyribosomes and act to govern translation rates, and that
they also play a role in innate immune defense to virus infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Saunders et al. (2001) determined that the
NFAR gene contains 21 exons and spans 16.2 kb. The 90-kD NFAR1 variant
expresses exon 18, which contains several stop codons that lead to
termination at amino acid 702. The 110-kD NFAR2 variant lacks exon 18
but contains exons 19, 20, and 21.

Viranaicken et al. (2006) identified an additional alternatively spliced
exon within intron 2 of the mouse and human ILF3 genes, increasing the
total number of exons to 22.

MAPPING

Saunders et al. (2001) mapped the NFAR gene to chromosome 19p13 by FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pfeifer et al. (2008) found that mice lacking Nfar died in utero.

610433	TITLE *610433 LYMPHOCYTE ANTIGEN 6 COMPLEX, LOCUS G5B; LY6G5B
;;G5B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LY6G5B belongs to a cluster of leukocyte antigen-6 (LY6) genes located
in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on
chromosome 6. Members of the LY6 superfamily typically contain 70 to 80
amino acids, including 8 to 10 cysteines. Most LY6 proteins are attached
to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that
is directly involved in signal transduction (Mallya et al., 2002).

CLONING

By EST database searching and RT-PCR analysis, Mallya et al. (2002)
obtained a full-length LY6G5B cDNA. The predicted protein contains an
N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a cys-rich LY6 domain and a
C-terminal hydrophobic region. RT-PCR detected a 606-bp product in
numerous hematopoietic cell lines and in fetal brain and adult lung.
Faint expression was detected in fetal liver and kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mallya et al. (2002) determined that the LY6G5B gene contains 3 exons
and spans about 1.3 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Mallya et al. (2002) mapped the LY6G5B
gene to a LY6 gene cluster within the MHC class III region on chromosome
6p21.3.

612696	TITLE *612696 VAULT RNA 1-2; VTRNA1-2
;;HVG2;;
VAULT RNA COMPONENT 2; VAULTRC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vaults are large cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins composed largely of MVP
(605088) and a nontranslated vault RNA component. By PCR of a human
genomic DNA library, Kickhoefer et al. (1998) cloned 3 vault RNA genes,
HVG1 (VTRNA1-1; 612695), HVG2 (VTRNA1-2), and HVG3 (VTRNA1-3; 612697).
Both HVG2 and HVG3 contain 86 bases and have an internal RNA polymerase
III (see 606007)-type promoter element and a typical polymerase III
termination signal. They both have an internal 10-base deletion compared
with HVG1.

Kickhoefer et al. (1999) found that only HVG1 was expressed in all human
cell lines examined. When expressed, HVG2 and HVG3 were often associated
with the supernatant fraction rather than microsomal pellets containing
vaults.

Nandy et al. (2009) described the structure of VTRNA1-2. The
88-nucleotide RNA forms an extended stem-loop structure with asymmetric
internal bulges. It contains characteristic internal polymerase III
A-box and B-box promoter elements and a downstream B2-box motif. Size
exclusion chromatography of fractionated HeLa cells, followed by
Northern and Western blot analyses, detected about 5% of the VTRNA1-1
and VTRNA1-2 content eluting with MVP, while 95% remained in the
supernatant.

GENE FUNCTION

Kickhoefer et al. (1998) found that HVG1, but not HVG2 or HVG3,
associated with vaults in human cell lines.

Nandy et al. (2009) found that expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2,
VTRNA1-3, and CBL3 (VTRNA2-1; 614938) was upregulated in cord blood
lymphocytes infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Upregulation was
highest for VTRNA1-1 (about 1,100-fold) and lowest for CBL3 (about
3-fold). Expression of VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and CBL3 was also upregulated
by the EBV-related Kaposi sarcoma virus, but not by members of other
virus families.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) determined that the upstream region of the
VTRNA1-2 gene contains a TATA-like element, a consensus proximal
sequence, and a cAMP response element.

MAPPING

Kickhoefer et al. (2003) stated that the VTRNA1-1, VTRNA1-2, and
VTRNA1-3 genes map to a 16-kb region of chromosome 5.

Nandy et al. (2009) stated that the VTRNA1-2 gene is located near the
PCDHA gene cluster (604966), which Wu and Maniatis (1999) mapped to
chromosome 5q31.

;;OGT-INTERACTING PROTEIN, 106-KD; OIP106;;
KIAA1042;;
MILTON, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned KIAA1042. The deduced protein
contains 953 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected high expression of
OIP106 in spinal cord and moderate expression in all other tissues and
specific brain regions examined.

By searching a sequence database for homologs of rat Oip98 (ALS2CR3;
607334), Iyer et al. (2003) identified KIAA1042, which they designated
OIP106. OIP106 contains coiled-coil domains. Confocal and electron
microscopy showed that OIP106 colocalized with RNA polymerase II (see
180660) in nuclear puncta in HeLa cells. In vitro translation
synthesized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 115 kD by
SDS/PAGE. Western blot analysis detected a 115-kD OIP106 protein in HeLa
cell lysates. Further analysis revealed expression of OIP106 in all cell
lines examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Iyer et al. (2003) found that OIP106 interacted with the
tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT (300255) and was O-glycosylated by OGT.
However, unlike other O-glycosylation substrates, OIP106 formed stable
in vitro and in vivo associations with OGT. Coimmunoprecipitations
confirmed that OIP106 interacts with RNA polymerase II and with OGT in
vivo.

Numerous studies have shown that neuroreceptors, including
gamma-aminobutyric acid type A, or GABA(A), receptors, are not
stationary structures on the cell surface. Instead, they undergo a
constant flux whereby surface-bound receptors are endocytosed to form an
intracellular pool, and receptors in this pool are either recycled back
onto the cell surface or shunted toward lysosome-mediated degradation.
Several pieces of evidence suggest that TRAK1, and perhaps TRAK2
(ALS2CR3; 607334), is involved in this trafficking process. Both TRAK1
and TRAK2 are associated with the motor protein kinesin (see 602809)
(Brickley et al., 2005), and TRAK2 can bind to the beta-2 subunit of
GABA(A) receptors (Beck et al., 2002). Based on these observations,
Gilbert et al. (2006) hypothesized that TRAK1 has a crucial role in
regulating the endocytic trafficking of GABA(A) receptors. TRAK1 may
facilitate the targeting of endocytosed GABA(A) receptors back to the
cell surface or block them from degradation. TRAK1 may also be involved
in directing newly synthesized GABA(A) receptors to the cell surface.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the OIP106
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP stSG4620). Gilbert et al. (2006) stated that
this gene, which they referred to as TRAK1, is located on 3p.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hypertonia, which results from motor pathway defects in the central
nervous system (CNS), is observed in numerous neurologic disorders,
including cerebral palsy, stroke, spinal cord injury, stiff-person
syndrome (184850), spastic paraplegia, dystonia, and Parkinson disease.
Mice with mutation in the 'hypertonic' gene (hyrt) exhibit severe
hypertonia as their primary symptom. Gilbert et al. (2006) showed that
Hyrt mutant mice have much lower levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid type
A, or GABA(A), receptors in their CNS, particularly the lower motor
neurons, than do wildtype mice, indicating that the hypertonicity of the
mutants is likely to be caused by deficits in GABA-mediated motor neuron
inhibition. By linkage analysis they localized the mutant gene
responsible for the hyrt phenotype to mouse chromosome 9 in a region
containing the KIAA1042 gene. Mouse KIAA1042 contains 16 exons and
predicts a protein of 939 amino acids. Sequencing of KIAA1042 in hyrt
homozygotes revealed a 20-bp deletion in the last exon of KIAA1042 that
results in a frameshift after amino acid position 824. Given that the
deletion disrupts only the final 12% of the protein, it may result in
partial loss of function.

NOMENCLATURE

Gilbert et al. (2006) noted that the TRAK1 gene was also referred to as
mammalian Milton (Stowers et al., 2002).

604745	TITLE *604745 TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-LIKE 5; TCFL5
DESCRIPTION Transcription factors containing basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motifs
play important roles in the regulation of neurogenesis, myogenesis,
cardiogenesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. By differential
display analysis of PCR products from mRNAs isolated from 9 different
human tissues, Maruyama et al. (1998) identified a testis-specific cDNA,
which they designated transcription factor-like-5 (TCFL5), encoding a
452-amino acid protein that contains a bHLH motif. Immunohistochemical
staining located the gene product exclusively in cell nuclei of primary
spermatocytes at the pachytene stage. The authors concluded that TCFL5
may function as a transcription factor in spermatogenesis through
binding to a specific DNA sequence.

Maruyama et al. (1998) determined that the TCFL5 gene consists of 6
exons and spans approximately 24 kb of genomic DNA.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Maruyama et al. (1998) mapped the
TCFL5 gene to chromosome 20q13.3-qter.

602572	TITLE *602572 ANNEXIN A11; ANXA11
;;ANNEXIN XI; ANX11;;
AUTOANTIGEN, 56-KD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ANXA11 is a member of the annexin family of calcium-dependent
phospholipid-binding proteins. Annexins have unique N-terminal domains
and homologous C-terminal domains containing the calcium-dependent
phospholipid-binding sites.

CLONING

To identify a 56-kD antigen recognized by sera from patients with
autoimmune diseases, Misaki et al. (1994) screened a human
teratocarcinoma cDNA expression library with the anti-56-kD antigen
autoantibodies. They isolated a cDNA predicting a 505-amino acid protein
with 60% identity to other annexins in the conserved C-terminal domain
and 92.5% identity to bovine annexin XI over the entire protein. Misaki
et al. (1994) concluded that the 56-kD autoantigen is human annexin XI,
or ANXA11.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bances et al. (2000) determined that the mouse Anxa11 gene contains 15
exons and spans 40 kB. Exon 1 is untranslated, and intron 1 spans about
20 kb. The human ANXA11 gene has the same general structure as the mouse
gene; however, EST database analysis indicated that human ANXA11
transcripts also use variably spliced exons 1b and 1c, which can
lengthen the 5-prime UTR. The intronic sequences of the mouse and human
ANXA11 genes contain several types of repetitive elements, including
retroviral long terminal repeats. The mouse promoter region contains a
remnant LINE-1 insertion not found in the human gene. The 5-prime
flanking region of the ANXA11 gene contains a CpG island and MYOD
(159970), SP1 (189906), and glucocorticoid response elements, but no
proximal TATA or CAAT boxes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the ANXA11
gene and susceptibility to sarcoidosis, see SS3 (612388).

MAPPING

Morgan et al. (1998) mapped the ANXA11 gene to 10q22.3-q23.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

By genomic sequence analysis, Bances et al. (2000) mapped the mouse
Anxa11 gene to chromosome 14.

607001	TITLE *607001 EUCHROMATIC HISTONE METHYLTRANSFERASE 1; EHMT1
;;EUHMTASE1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ogawa et al. (2002) identified the components of the E2F6 (602944)
complex, which represses transcription. Although histone acetylase and
deacetylase activities were not detected in the E2F6 complex,
methyltransferase activity was. Ogawa et al. (2002) identified
euchromatic histone methyltransferase-1 as a component of the E2F6
complex. The 1,267-amino acid EU-HMTase-1 protein contains ankyrin
repeats and a SET domain. EU-HMTase-1 shares 63% sequence similarity
with NG36/G9A (604599). EU-HMTase-1 exhibited histone methyltransferase
activity with a specificity for histone H3 in core histones, whereas it
hardly methylated nucleosomes, suggesting that other subunits in the
E2F6 complex are required for modification of nucleosomal substrates.
Ogawa et al. (2002) demonstrated that lysine-9 of histone H3 is the
target of euchromatic histone methyltransferase-1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kleefstra et al. (2006) stated that the EHMT1 gene contains 28 exons.
The initiation ATG occurs in exon 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The chromosome 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome, or Kleefstra syndrome
(610253), is a mental retardation syndrome that was thought to be caused
by small interstitial deletions in the 9q subtelomeric region. Kleefstra
et al. (2005) characterized the breakpoints in a female with a balanced
translocation t(X;9)(p11.23;q34.3) and found that the chromosome
breakpoint disrupted the EHMT1 gene in intron 9. The patient presented
typical features of 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome, which suggested
that the core phenotype of this entity is due to haploinsufficiency of
EHMT1. Kleefstra et al. (2006) performed a comprehensive mutation
analysis of the EHMT1 gene in 23 patients with clinical presentations
consistent with 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome. Three patients had
microdeletions that comprised the EHMT1 gene; 1 interstitial deletion
reduced the critical region for this syndrome. Two patients had de novo
mutations, a nonsense mutation and a frameshift mutation, in the EHMT1
gene (607001.0001-607001.0002). These results appeared to establish that
haploinsufficiency of EHMT1 is causative for the 9q subtelomeric
deletion syndrome.

In 6 of 24 patients with a clinical phenotype consistent with 9q
deletion syndrome who had normal chromosome studies, Kleefstra et al.
(2009) identified 6 different intragenic mutations in the EHMT1 gene
(see, e.g., C1042Y, 607001.0003 and R260X, 607001.0004). There were 2
nonsense mutations, a deletion, 2 splice site mutations, and 1 missense
mutation in a highly conserved residue. A comparison of the phenotype
between these 6 patients and 16 additional patients with larger
deletions of 9q showed no genotype/phenotype correlations. Kleefstra et
al. (2009) concluded that haploinsufficiency for EHMT1 is the basis for
the phenotypic features in this disorder.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schaefer et al. (2009) found that conditional ablation of Ehmt2 (604599)
or Ehmt1 in postnatal mouse forebrain neurons caused a reduction in
euchromatic H3K9 methylation in the forebrain and
upregulation/derepression of neuronal and nonneuronal genes (e.g., AFP;
104150), including those involved in developmental stage-dependent gene
expression (e.g., Dach2; 300608). These changes were not associated with
alterations in neuronal architecture or electrophysiologic features.
Mice with postnatal knockout of Ehmt1 or Ehmt2 in the forebrain showed
decreased exploratory behavior in a novel environment and had a decrease
in the preference for sucrose solution compared to wildtype mice, the
latter of which may indicate an underlying dysfunction in
motivation/reward. Both Ehmt2-null and Ehmt1-null mice became obese.
Ehmt1-null mice also showed defects in contextual and cued fear
conditioning, indicating a problem with learning and memory. Mice
lacking Ehmt2 specifically in Drd1 (126449)- or Drd2 (126450)-expressing
neurons in the striatum showed altered locomotor and behavioral
responses to Drd-specific receptor agonist or antagonists, reflecting
reductions of cell type-specific activity. The changes in these mice
resembled the features of the human chromosome 9q34.3 deletion syndrome.
Schaefer et al. (2009) concluded that Ehmt1 and Ehmt2 are key regulators
of cognition and adaptive behavior in adult mice through regulation of
transcriptional homeostasis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME
EHMT1, ARG1137TER

In a patient with clinical features of the 9q subtelomeric deletion
syndrome (610253), Kleefstra et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous
3409C-T transition in exon 24 of the EHMT1 gene that caused an
arg1137-to-stop substitution (R1137X).

.0002
KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME
EHMT1, 13-BP DEL

In a patient with clinical features of the 9q subtelomeric deletion
syndrome (610253), Kleefstra et al. (2006) identified a heterozygous
13-bp deletion in exon 8 of the EHMT1 gene (1320_1332del13). The
deletion resulted in a frameshift (P442fs) and a premature stop that
predicted a mutant protein of 526 amino acids.

.0003
KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME
EHMT1, CYS1042TYR

In a 20-year-old woman with a phenotype consistent with chromosome 9q
subtelomeric deletion syndrome (610253), Kleefstra et al. (2009)
identified a de novo heterozygous 3125G-A transition in the EHMT1 gene,
resulting in a cys1042-to-tyr (C1042Y) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the pre-SET domain of the protein. Protein modeling
predicted that the substitution would abolish a strong cysteine-zinc
interaction and interfere with the local conformation of the pre-SET
domain. The phenotype was fully compatible with the deletion syndrome,
and included severe psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, and
characteristic facial features of midface hypoplasia, synophrys, and
eversion of the lower lip. She also had pulmonary stenosis. Kleefstra et
al. (2009) postulated loss of protein function and haploinsufficiency
rather than a dominant-negative effect.

.0004
KLEEFSTRA SYNDROME
EHMT1, ARG260TER

In a 19-year-old man with a phenotype consistent with chromosome 9q
subtelomeric deletion syndrome (610253), Kleefstra et al. (2009)
identified a de novo heterozygous 778C-T transition in the EHMT1 gene,
resulting in an arg260-to-ter (R260X) substitution, predicted to result
in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The man had mental retardation,
seizures, and characteristic facial abnormalities.

607419	TITLE *607419 GEM-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 7; GEMIN7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GEMIN7 is part of the large macromolecular SMN complex (see 600354),
which is localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and plays a
role in the cytoplasmic assembly of small nuclear ribonuculeoproteins
(snRNPs).

CLONING

Pellizzoni et al. (2002) identified a number of proteins that
coimmunoprecipitate with SMN or with GEMIN2 (602595) from lysates of
human kidney cells, including GEMIN6 (607006) and a 15-kD protein.
Baccon et al. (2002) sequenced the 15-kD protein, which they called
GEMIN7, identified corresponding ESTs, and cloned GEMIN7 by PCR
amplification of a cDNA library. The deduced 131-amino acid GEMIN7
protein contains several RG repeats. By EST database searching, Baccon
et al. (2002) also identified the putative mouse ortholog, which shares
82% amino acid sequence identity with the human protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation and immunolocalization experiments, Baccon
et al. (2002) demonstrated that GEMIN7 is a component of the SMN complex
and colocalizes with SMN in the cytoplasm and in gems. Binding
experiments showed that GEMIN7 interacts directly with SMN and GEMIN6
and mediates the association of GEMIN6 with the SMN complex. The RG
repeats were necessary for its interaction with SMN. GEMIN7 also
interacted with several Sm proteins of snRNPs, particularly with SmE
(SNRPE; 128260).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GEMIN7
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP SHGC-112).

603436	TITLE *603436 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 205; ZNF205
;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 210; ZNF210
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The largest family of zinc finger proteins is the C2H2, or Kruppel,
type. See 165220. Some members of the Kruppel family contain a conserved
KRAB region that can be divided into 2 subregions, the A box and the B
box. See 601742. While constructing a transcript map of the critical
region of familial Mediterranean fever (see MEFV; 608107), Deng et al.
(1998) isolated cDNAs encoding ZNF205, which they designated ZNF210.
Sequence analysis indicated that the predicted 504-amino acid protein is
a Kruppel-type zinc finger protein that contains a KRAB A box N-terminal
to 8 zinc finger motifs. Northern blot analysis revealed that the 2.2-kb
ZNF210 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested. An additional
transcript was detected in a number of tissues.

MAPPING

By analysis of clones from the MEFV region, Deng et al. (1998)
determined that the ZNF205 gene is located approximately 120 kb from the
MEFV gene on 16p13.3. They reported that 4 other zinc finger genes are
located in the MEFV region, including ZNF200 (603231), ZNF174, and
FPM315.

604764	TITLE *604764 ZINC FINGER AND HOMEODOMAIN PROTEIN 1; ZHX1
DESCRIPTION NFYA (189903), NFYB (189904), and NFYC (605344) comprise the
heterotrimeric transcription factor known as nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), or
CCAAT-binding protein (CBF). NF-Y binds many CCAAT box elements and Y
box elements, which are inverted CCAAT boxes. Mutations of these
elements that disrupt the binding of NF-Y result in decreased
transcription from various tissue-specific and inducible promoters. To
identify proteins that interact with NF-Y and that may play a role in
tissue-specific or hormone-inducible promoter activity, Yamada et al.
(1999) screened a human liver cDNA library using a yeast 2-hybrid system
with the NFYA subunit as bait. They isolated a partial ZHX1 cDNA lacking
5-prime coding sequence. Yamada et al. (1999) subsequently cloned the
remaining ZHX1 coding sequence. The predicted 873-amino acid ZHX1
protein contains 2 N-terminal zinc fingers, 5 central and C-terminal
homeodomains, a C-terminal acidic region, and 2 putative nuclear
localization signals. Human and mouse ZHX1 share 91% amino acid sequence
identity. The authors demonstrated that ZHX1 specifically interacts with
NFYA both in vivo and in vitro. This interaction does not require the
zinc fingers of ZHX1. Northern blot analysis detected major 4.5- and
5-kb ZHX1 transcripts in all tissues tested, namely heart, lung, liver,
pancreas, kidney, brain, skeletal muscle, and placenta. The 5-kb
transcript was more highly expressed than the 4.5-kb transcript in most
of these tissues.

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel, Yamada et al. (1999) mapped
the ZHX1 gene to chromosome 8. They localized the ZHX1 gene to 8q by
radiation hybrid mapping.

608503	TITLE *608503 POLY(rC)-BINDING PROTEIN 4; PCBP4
;;ALPHA-CP4;;
MCG10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The poly(rC)-binding proteins are a subfamily of KH-domain-containing
RNA-binding proteins that bind C-rich pyrimidine tracts and play pivotal
roles in a broad spectrum of posttranscriptional events (Chkheidze and
Liebhaber, 2003).

CLONING

By subtraction hybridization for genes induced by p53 (191170) in a lung
cancer cell line, Zhu and Chen (2000) cloned PCBP4, which they
designated MCG10. They also identified an alternatively spliced
transcript, which they designated MCG10as. The deduced proteins contain
424 and 369 amino acids. Each protein contains an N-terminal KH (HNRNPK
(600712)-homology) domain, a C-terminal KH domain, 3 proline-rich
domains, a potential nuclear export signal, and a potential nuclear
localization signal.

Based on its sequence similarity with mouse and human PCBP2 (601210),
Makeyev and Liebhaber (2000) cloned mouse Pcbp4, and using this sequence
as query to search an EST database, they identified human PCBP4. Both
mouse and human PCBP4 encode 403-amino acid proteins with calculated
molecular masses of 41.5 kD. PCBP4 contains 2 KH domains in the
N-terminal half, and 1 near the C terminus. Quantitative RT-PCR detected
expression in all mouse tissues examined.

Chkheidze and Liebhaber (2003) cloned a PCBP4 transcript that encodes a
deduced 329-amino acid protein. Epitope-tagged PCBP4 localized to the
cytosol of transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhu and Chen (2000) found that PCBP4 was induced following p53
expression in a lung cancer cell line. Expression of a p53 mutant
defective in transactivation, and a p53 lacking the proline-rich domain,
did not induce PCBP4 expression. Chemically-induced DNA damage also led
to p53-dependent PCBP4 upregulation. By generating cell lines that
inducibly expressed either wildtype or mutated forms of the 2 PCBP4
splice variants, Zhu and Chen (2000) found that both variants suppressed
cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in
G(2)-M. Through their KH domains, both variants bound poly(rC) and their
RNA-binding activity was necessary to induce apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhu and Chen (2000) identified 3 potential p53-binding sites in the
untranslated region upstream of the PCBP4 transcription start site.
Makeyev and Liebhaber (2000) determined that the PCBP4 gene contains 14
exons and spans 9.8 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhu and Chen (2000) and Makeyev and
Liebhaber (2000) mapped the PCBP4 gene to chromosome 3p21. By FISH,
Makeyev and Liebhaber (2000) mapped the mouse Pcbp4 gene to a syntenic
region of mouse chromosome 9F1-F2.

605119	TITLE *605119 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE, MAGNESIUM-DEPENDENT, 1G; PPM1G
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE, MAGNESIUM-DEPENDENT, 1, GAMMA ISOFORM;;
PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C, GAMMA ISOFORM; PP2CG;;
PP2C-GAMMA
DESCRIPTION Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are key regulatory
mechanisms in many cellular processes. Four major classes of
serine/threonine protein phosphatases have been described: PP1, PP2A,
PP2B, and PP2C. These proteins differ in their substrate specificity,
divalent cation requirements, and sensitivity to inhibitors. PP1, PP2A,
and PP2B phosphatases have catalytic subunits with significant sequence
similarity, and regulatory subunits which are believed to regulate
activity or cellular localization. In contrast, PP2C phosphatases are
monomeric and have amino acid sequences that are distinct from those of
the other phosphatases. By searching an EST database using the amino
acid sequence of PP2C-alpha (PPM1A; 606108) as the query, Travis and
Welsh (1997) identified PPM1G, which they called PP2C-gamma. They
isolated a human skeletal muscle cDNA containing a complete PPM1G coding
sequence. The deduced 546-amino acid PPM1G protein contains the highly
conserved signature sequences of PP2C phosphatases, suggesting that it
is a member of the PP2C family. However, PPM1G shares only 34% amino
acid sequence identity with human PP2C-alpha. A distinctive feature of
PPM1G is the presence of a large acidic domain. PPM1G also contains
putative PEST sequences, numerous potential sites for phosphorylation,
and a possible myristylation site. Travis and Welsh (1997) demonstrated
that recombinant PPM1G expressed in bacteria requires magnesium or
manganese for activity, and is inhibited by fluoride but not okadaic
acid or vanadate. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately
2.3-kb PPM1G transcript in all human tissues examined, with the highest
levels in testis, skeletal muscle, and heart.

Dephosphorylation of splicing factors may be important for catalysis
after spliceosome assembly. To identify activities involved in human
pre-mRNA splicing, Murray et al. (1999) separated HeLa cell nuclear
extract into 5 complementing fractions. They purified an activity that
they called 'splicing-complementing factor-1' (SCF1) from 1 of these
fractions by assaying for reconstitution of splicing in the presence of
the remaining 4 fractions. Murray et al. (1999) showed that a component
of SCF1 is PPM1G. They demonstrated that human PPM1G is physically
associated with the spliceosome in vitro throughout the splicing
reaction, but is first required during the early stages of spliceosome
assembly for efficient formation of the A complex. The phosphatase
activity is required for the splicing function of PPM1G, as an active
site mutant does not support spliceosome activity. The requirement for
PPM1G is highly specific, as the closely related phosphatase PP2C-alpha
cannot substitute for PPM1G. Consistent with a role in splicing, PPM1G
localizes to the nucleus in vivo. Murray et al. (1999) concluded that at
least 1 specific dephosphorylation event catalyzed by PPM1G is required
for formation of the spliceosome.

137780	TITLE *137780 GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; GFAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Glial fibrillary acidic protein is an intermediate-filament (IF) protein
that is highly specific for cells of astroglial lineage. Reeves et al.
(1989) isolated a cDNA encoding GFAP and determined its nucleotide
sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence indicated that GFAP shares
structural similarities--particularly in the central rod domain and to a
lesser degree in the carboxyl-terminal domain--with other IF proteins
found in nonepithelial cell types. Considerable sequence divergence in
the amino-terminal region of GFAP suggested that the tissue-specific
functions of this IF protein may be mediated through this region of the
molecule. GFAP is a useful marker of astroglia in the brain.

Using PS1 (104311) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Nielsen et al.
(2002) cloned a splice variant of GFAP, which they called GFAP-epsilon,
from a fetal brain cDNA library. GFAP-epsilon contains 42 amino acids
encoded by exon 7a at its C terminus in place of the 43-amino acid C
terminus encoded by exons 8 and 9 of GFAP-alpha, the originally
identified GFAP transcript.

MAPPING

Bernier et al. (1988) used cDNA probes to determine the chromosomal
location of the GFAP gene in the mouse by following its segregation in a
panel of interspecies somatic cell hybrids. Furthermore, they defined
RFLPs associated with the gene. Patterns of inheritance of these RFLPs
in recombinant inbred strains of mice showed that GFAP is encoded by a
single genetic locus on mouse chromosome 11. The murine gene is in close
proximity to the genes encoding p53 and myeloperoxidase. By Southern
blot hybridization of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization,
Bongcam-Rudloff et al. (1991) mapped the GFAP gene to human 17q21.
Brownell et al. (1991) also assigned the GFAP gene to chromosome 17 by
screening a mouse/human somatic cell hybrid panel with a GFAP cDNA
fragment.

GENE FUNCTION

Using binding assays with recombinant proteins, Nielsen et al. (2002)
determined that the unique C terminus of the GFAP-epsilon splice variant
was required for interaction with PS1, as were the coiled-coil 2 and
linker 1-2 regions shared with GFAP-alpha. GFAP-alpha did not interact
with PS1. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis of point mutations introduced into PS1
indicated that 2 nonconservative amino acid substitutions abolished
interaction with GFAP-epsilon, but 2 conservative substitutions, both
associated with Alzheimer disease, did not effect GFAP-epsilon binding.
By transfection in human embryonic kidney cells and in mouse
neuroblastoma cells, Nielsen et al. (2002)found that GFAP-epsilon
associated with intermediate filaments and perfectly colocalized with
GFAP-alpha, suggesting that both isoforms are polymerized into the same
filamentous structures. A subpopulation of GFAP-epsilon also colocalized
with PS1 in the perinuclear region and in cytoplasmic granules.

Radomska et al. (2013) stated that 3 major GFAP splice variants,
GFAP-alpha, -delta, and -kappa, are present in human central nervous
system. They found that GFAP-alpha was the dominant GFAP variant in
primary cultured human astrocytes. Knockdown of the RNA-binding protein
QKI (609590), predominantly the QKI7 variant, reduced astrocyte content
of GFAP-alpha mRNA. Treatment of astrocytes with the antipsychotic drug
haloperidol increased the expression of both QKI7 and GFAP-alpha.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Alexander disease (203450) is a rare disorder of the central nervous
system. Infants with Alexander disease develop a leukoencephalopathy
with macrocephaly, seizures, and psychomotor retardation, leading to
death usually within the first decade; patients with juvenile or adult
forms typically experience ataxia, bulbar signs and spasticity, and a
more slowly progressive course. The pathologic hallmark of all forms of
Alexander disease is the presence of Rosenthal fibers, cytoplasmic
inclusions in astrocytes that contain the intermediate filament protein
GFAP in association with small heat-shock proteins. By sequence analysis
of DNA from patients representing different Alexander disease
phenotypes, Brenner et al. (2001) found that most cases were associated
with nonconservative mutations in the coding region of the GFAP gene.
Alexander disease, therefore, represents the first example of a primary
genetic disorder of astrocytes, one of the major cell types in the
vertebrate CNS. Each mutation identified in the GFAP gene was
heterozygous, suggesting a dominant mutation. Because parental DNA was
normal in all instances where it was available, the authors concluded
that most cases of Alexander disease result from de novo mutations. It
was noteworthy that mutations in only 4 codons accounted for Alexander
disease in 10 of 11 patients, and these were all arginine codons.
Arginine codons are recognized as particularly prone to mutation,
presumably due to methylation of the CpG dinucleotide. Brenner et al.
(2001) suggested that the GFAP mutations in Alexander disease most
likely act in a dominant gain-of-function manner, as the phenotype of
Gfap-null mice is subtle and does not resemble Alexander disease. They
pointed out that the results do not exclude the possibility that defects
in other genes may be responsible for some cases of Alexander disease.
For example, Schuelke et al. (1999) reported a child with a phenotype
resembling Alexander disease (but without pathologic confirmation) who
was homozygous for a mutation in the NDUFV1 gene (161015.0003).

Rodriguez et al. (2001) searched for GFAP mutations in a series of
patients who had heterogeneous clinical symptoms but were candidates for
Alexander disease on the basis of suggestive neuroimaging abnormalities.
De novo heterozygous missense GFAP mutations were found in exon 1 or
exon 4 in 14 of the 15 patients analyzed, including patients without
macrocephaly. Nine patients carried arginine mutations that had been
described elsewhere: 4 had arg239 to cys (137780.0001); 1 had arg239 to
his (137780.0002); and 1 had arg79 to his (137780.0004). The other 5
patients had 1 of 4 novel mutations, of which 2 affected arginine and 2
affected nonarginine residues. All mutations were located in the rod
domain of GFAP, and there was a correlation between clinical severity
and the affected amino acid.

Li et al. (2005) identified mutations in the GFAP gene in 41 patients
with Alexander disease. They stated that a total of 42 different GFAP
mutations had been identified, and almost all mutations resulted in a
gain-of-function dominant effect. There was a suggestion of male
predominance of the disorder.

Li et al. (2006) determined that the paternal chromosome carried the
GFAP mutation in 24 of 28 unrelated cases of Alexander disease analyzed,
suggesting that most mutations occur during spermatogenesis rather than
in the embryo. No effect of paternal age was observed.

In 13 unrelated Italian patients with Alexander disease, including 8
with the infantile, 2 with the juvenile, and 3 with the adult form,
Caroli et al. (2007) identified 11 different mutations in the GFAP gene
(see, e.g., 137780.0005), including 4 novel mutations. Ten mutations
occurred in the rod domains and 1 in the tail domain.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Rodriguez et al. (2001) could discern a genotype-phenotype correlation
for the 2 most frequently mutated arginine residues, R79 (8 patients)
and R239 (10 patients), with the phenotype of the R79 mutations
appearing much less severe than that of the R239 mutations. The 4
patients they found with R79 mutations appeared to be the least severely
affected: none developed macrocephaly, 3 achieved independent walking,
and, at the time of report, all were alive at ages 2.5 to 20 years.
Similarly, among the 4 patients with R79 mutations who were reported by
Brenner et al. (2001), 2 lived until the ages of 14 and 48 years, the
other 2 were still alive, at ages 7 and 8 years, at the time of report
by Rodriguez et al. (2001). Patients with R239 mutations, reported by
both Brenner et al. (2001) and Rodriguez et al. (2001), had marked
impairment of psychomotor development, and some had progressive
macrocephaly.

Gorospe et al. (2002) reported 12 genetically confirmed cases of
Alexander disease caused by 9 heterozygous point mutations in the GFAP
gene. The cases demonstrated variable ages of onset and symptoms. The
authors stated that no clear-cut genotype-phenotype correlations were
apparent.

ANIMAL MODEL

Messing et al. (1998) found that overexpression of human GFAP in
astrocytes of transgenic mice was fatal and was accompanied by the
presence of inclusion bodies indistinguishable from human Rosenthal
fibers, the pathologic hallmark of all forms of Alexander disease. These
results suggested that a primary alteration in the GFAP gene may be
responsible for Alexander disease.

Gomi et al. (1995), Pekny et al. (1995), Shibuki et al. (1996), and
Liedtke et al. (1996) independently reported generation of
GFAP-deficient mice. In all cases, the mutant mice are normal at birth
and develop grossly normal. Using immunohistochemical analysis, Pekny et
al. (1995) concluded that GFAP knockout mice are lacking intermediate
filaments in astrocytes of the hippocampus and in the white matter of
the spinal cord. Using microscopic analysis of brain sections, Liedtke
et al. (1996) observed a mutant phenotype characterized by abnormal
myelination, alterations in the blood-brain barrier, disorganization of
white matter architecture and vascularization, and hydrocephalus in
older mice associated with loss of white matter. They concluded that
GFAP is necessary for the long-term maintenance of normal CNS
myelination. Shibuki et al. (1996) observed that long-term depression at
parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses is deficient in GFAP knockout
mice. Furthermore, GFAP mutant mice exhibited a significant impairment
of eyeblink conditioning without any detectable deficits in motor
coordination tasks. They concluded that GFAP may be required for
communications between Bergmann glia and Purkinje cells during long-term
depression induction and maintenance.

Hagemann et al. (2005) performed gene expression analysis on olfactory
bulbs of transgenic mice overexpressing wildtype human GFAP at 2
different ages. Expression profiles revealed a stress response that
included genes involved in glutathione metabolism, peroxide
detoxification, and iron homeostasis. Many of these genes are regulated
by the transcription factor Nfe2l2 (600492), which is also increased in
expression at 3 weeks. An immune-related response occurred with
activation of cytokine and cytokine receptor genes, complement
components, and acute phase response genes. These transcripts were
further elevated with age, with additional induction of
macrophage-specific markers, such as Mac1 (ITGAM; 120980) and CD68
(153634), suggesting activation of microglia. At 4 months, decreased
expression of genes for microtubule-associated proteins, vesicular
trafficking proteins, and neurotransmitter receptors became apparent.
Interneuron-specific transcription factors, including Dlx family members
and Pax6 (607108), were downregulated as well as Gad1 (605363) and Gad2
(138275), suggesting impairment of GABAergic granule cells. Hagemann et
al. (2005) proposed a mechanism wherein an initial stress response by
astrocytes results in the activation of microglia and compromised
neuronal function.

Hagemann et al. (2009) noted that Rosenthal fibers in the complex
astrocytic inclusions characteristic of Alexander disease contain GFAP,
vimentin (VIM; 193060), plectin (PLEC1; 601282), ubiquitin (UBB;
191339), HSP27 (HSPB1; 602195), and alpha-B-crystallin (CRYAB; 123590).
CRYAB regulates GFAP assembly, and elevation of CRYAB is a consistent
feature of Alexander disease; however, its role in Rosenthal fibers and
disease pathology is not known. In a mouse model of Alexander disease,
Hagemann et al. (2009) showed that loss of Cryab resulted in increased
mortality, whereas elevation of Cryab rescued animals from terminal
seizures. When mice with Rosenthal fibers induced by overexpression of
GFAP were crossed into a Cryab-null background, over half died at 1
month of age. Restoration of Cryab expression through the GFAP promoter
reversed this outcome, showing the effect was astrocyte-specific.
Conversely, in mice carrying an Alexander disease-associated mutation
and in mice overexpressing wildtype GFAP, which, despite natural
induction of Cryab also died at 1 month, transgenic overexpression of
Cryab resulted in a markedly reduced CNS stress response, restored
expression of the glutamate transporter Glt1 (SLC1A2; 600300), and
protected these animals from death.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG239CYS

Brenner et al. (2001) found that 5 unrelated patients with Alexander
disease (203450) were heterozygous for mutations in codon 239 of the
GFAP gene. In 4 of these, a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 729 led to
an arg239-to-cys mutation (R239C). Age at death in these 4 patients
varied from 4 years to 11 years. The fifth patient had an arg239-to-his
mutation (137780.0002). DNA was normal in the parents where available.

In a 1-year-old female with typical features of Alexander disease,
Shiroma et al. (2001) identified the frequent R239C missense mutation.
The patient was born of nonconsanguineous parents. Early developmental
milestones were normal, but at the age of 1 year she had the first
febrile seizure, and after 2 weeks she had status epilepticus with
fever. Thereafter, she lost the ability to stand with help and to speak
words. Examination showed increased head circumference (+2.3 SD) and
good social response. Plantar responses were bilaterally extensor. In
addition to the typical manifestations of macrocephaly, psychomotor
retardation, spasticity, and seizures, the radiologic findings were
typical of Alexander disease.

Rodriguez et al. (2001) found the arg239-to-cys mutation in heterozygous
state in 4 of 14 patients with infantile Alexander disease. One of the
patients was 18 months old at the time of onset, underwent deterioration
of psychomotor development at the age of 6 years, had a head
circumference of 1.5 standard deviations above the mean, and was alive
at age 8 years.

Li et al. (2005) reported 2 unrelated patients with juvenile-onset
Alexander disease who were heterozygous for the R239C mutation. One
patient had onset at age 2 years and the other at age 4 years.

.0002
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG239HIS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Brenner et al. (2001)
identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 730 of the GFAP gene,
causing an arg239-to-his substitution. This infant died at the age of 11
months. Four other patients had an arg239-to-cys mutation; see
137780.0001.

Li et al. (2005) reported 5 unrelated patients with Alexander disease
resulting from the R239H mutation. All patients had a severe form of the
disease, with onset by age 6 months and death by age 5 years.

.0003
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG416TRP

In 2 unrelated patients with Alexander disease (203450) that led to
death at ages 7 and 8, respectively, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1260 of the GFAP gene, resulting in an
arg416-to-trp substitution.

Li et al. (2005) noted that the R416W mutation had been identified in
patients with infantile-, juvenile-, and adult-onset Alexander disease.

A pathologic hallmark of Alexander disease is the abundance of protein
aggregates in astrocytes. These aggregates, termed Rosenthal fibers,
contain the protein chaperones alpha-B crystallin (123590) and HSP27
(602195) as well as GFAP. Perng et al. (2006) showed that the R416W
mutation in GFAP significantly perturbs in vitro filament assembly. The
filamentous structures formed resemble assembly intermediates but
aggregated more strongly. Consistent with the heterozygosity of the
mutation, this effect was dominant over wildtype GFAP in coassembly
experiments. Transient transfection studies demonstrated that R416W GFAP
induces the formation of GFAP-containing cytoplasmic aggregates in a
wide range of different cell types, including astrocytes. Monoclonal
antibodies specific for R146W GFAP revealed, for the first time for any
intermediate filament-based disease, the presence of the mutant protein
in the characteristic histopathologic features of the disease, namely,
Rosenthal fibers. The data confirmed that the effects of the R416W GFAP
are dominant, changing the assembly process in a way that encourages
aberrant filament-filament interactions that then lead to protein
aggregation and chaperone sequestration as early events in Alexander
disease.

.0004
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG79HIS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450) with onset at age 10 years
and death at age 48 years, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a G-to-A
transition at nucleotide 250 of the GFAP gene, leading to an
arg79-to-his substitution. Brenner et al. (2001) found the same mutation
in a patient with Alexander disease still living at the age of 8 years.

.0005
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG79CYS

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450) with onset at 3 months and
death at 14 years, Brenner et al. (2001) identified a C-to-T transition
at nucleotide 249 of the GFAP gene, leading to an arg79-to-cys (R79C)
substitution. Brenner et al. (2001) found the same mutation in a patient
with Alexander disease still living at the age of 7 years.

Caroli et al. (2007) identified the R79C mutation in 3 unrelated Italian
boys with Alexander disease. All had onset before age 10 months. One of
the patients died at age 19 years.

.0006
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG88CYS

In 2 unrelated patients with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et
al. (2001) found an arg88-to-cys (R88C) mutation in the GFAP gene.

.0007
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG88SER

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found an arg88-to-ser (R88S) missense mutation in heterozygous state in
the GFAP gene.

.0008
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, LEU76PHE

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found a leu76-to-phe (L76F) heterozygous missense mutation in the GFAP
gene.

.0009
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ASN77TYR

In a patient with Alexander disease (203450), Rodriguez et al. (2001)
found a de novo, heterozygous missense mutation, asn77-to-tyr (N77Y), in
the GFAP gene.

.0010
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, GLU362ASP

In a patient with juvenile-onset Alexander disease (203450), Sawaishi et
al. (2002) identified a homozygous 1100G-C transition in the GFAP gene,
resulting in a glu362-to-asp substitution. A brother and the parents did
not carry the mutation. The mutation occurred in the C-terminal end of
the central rod domain, a highly conserved region of GFAP and other
types of intermediate filaments (e.g., vimentin (193060), desmin
(125660), keratin-1 (139350)).

.0011
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ARG276LEU

In 2 Japanese brothers with Alexander disease (203450), Namekawa et al.
(2002) described an 841G-T transition at nucleotide 841, resulting in an
arg276-to-leu (R276L) substitution. Both brothers had spastic paresis
without palatal myoclonus, and MRI showed marked atrophy of the medulla
oblongata and cervicothoracic cord. The autopsy showed severely involved
shrunken pyramids but scarce Rosenthal fibers. Moderate numbers of
Rosenthal fibers were observed in the stratum subcallosum and
hippocampal fimbria. One patient was well until age 33; the second
brother developed regressive spastic gait at the age of 48 years and
gradually noticed that he could not raise his left arm. The parents were
nonconsanguineous and both died in their eighth decade without apparent
evidence of a neurologic disorder. They had only the 2 offspring, both
of whom had no children. The R276L mutation was heterozygous in both
brothers. Assuming accurate attribution of paternity, one might suggest
that this represented an example of parental gonadal mosaicism.

.0012
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, LEU352PRO

In a patient with a severe form of infantile Alexander disease (203450),
Bassuk et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous 1055T-C transition in the
GFAP gene, resulting in a leu352-to-pro (L352P) substitution. Residue
352 is a highly conserved amino acid that is found in all intermediate
filament proteins and across species.

.0013
ALEXANDER DISEASE
GFAP, ASP78GLU

In a family with an autosomal dominant adult form of Alexander disease
(203450), Stumpf et al. (2003) identified a heterozygous C-to-A change
in exon 1 of the GFAP gene, resulting in an asp78-to-glu (D78E)
substitution. Amino acid 78 lies in the rod domain of the protein. The
clinical phenotype varied in severity, but the pattern of evolution was
similar in all affected members. Although sleep disturbances and
dysautonomia, primarily constipation, began in childhood, the major
neurologic features began in the third or fourth decade of life. MRI of
the older patients showed atrophy of the medulla without signal
abnormalities.

120353	TITLE *120353 MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 1; MMP1
;;COLLAGENASE, FIBROBLAST; CLG; CLGN;;
COLLAGENASE, INTERSTITIAL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Matrix metalloproteinases are zinc-dependent proteases that degrade
extracellular matrix proteins. MMP1 is also known as collagenase (EC
3.4.23.7) (Nagase et al., 1992).

CLONING

Brinckerhoff et al. (1987) identified a cDNA clone of human collagenase.
The clone identified a single collagenase gene of about 17 kb from blots
of human genomic DNA. Restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequence data
indicated that the cDNA clone was full length and that it was identical
to that described for human skin fibroblast collagenase. Collagenase is
the only enzyme able to initiate breakdown of the interstitial
collagens, types I, II, and III. The fact that the collagens are the
most abundant proteins in the body means that collagenase plays a key
role in the remodeling that occurs constantly in both normal and
diseased conditions. The identity of human skin and synovial cell
collagenase and the ubiquity of this enzyme and of its substrates,
collagens I, II, and III, imply that the common mechanism controlling
collagenolysis throughout the body may be operative in both normal and
disease states.

MAPPING

Gerhard et al. (1987) confirmed the assignment of the collagenase gene
to chromosome 11 by the use of a DNA probe for Southern analysis of
somatic cell hybrids. Analysis of cell lines with rearrangements
involving chromosome 11 indicated that the gene is in the region
11q11-q23. Church et al. (1983) had used somatic cell hybrids between
mouse cells and human normal skin and corneal fibroblasts and recessive
dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB; 226600) skin fibroblasts to
assign the human structural gene for collagenase to chromosome 11.
Production of collagenase was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay.
It appeared that both the normal and the RDEB collagenase gene mapped to
chromosome 11. This was earlier taken to indicate that the abnormal
collagenase produced by RDEB cells represented a mutation of the
structural gene. Later work indicated that both the autosomal dominant
(131750) and autosomal recessive forms of dystrophic epidermolysis
bullosa are due to mutations in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1;
120120). The excessive formation of collagenase must represent a
secondary phenomenon, not the primary defect. It should be noted that
fibroblasts from patients with the Werner syndrome (277700) also express
high constitutive levels of collagenase in vitro (Bauer et al., 1986).

Pendas et al. (1996) isolated a 1.5-Mb YAC clone mapping to 11q22.
Detailed analysis of this nonchimeric YAC clone ordered 7 MMP genes as
follows: cen--MMP8 (120355)--MMP10 (185260)--MMP1--MMP3 (185250)--MMP12
(601046)--MMP7 (178990)--MMP13 (600108)--tel.

GENE FUNCTION

Maymon et al. (2000) measured levels of MMP1 in amniotic fluid from 353
women, including those with intact membranes, in term or preterm labor
or not in labor, and those with term and premature rupture of the
membranes (610504), with or without microbial invasion of the amniotic
cavity. MMP1 was detectable in 81.3% (287 of 353) amniotic fluid
samples, and the concentration increased with increasing gestational
age. Analysis of the matrix metalloproteinase profile of amniotic fluid
in term and preterm rupture of membranes showed that patterns were
similar for every enzyme except MMP1 and MMP8 (120355), suggesting
different molecular pathophysiologic mechanisms for extracellular matrix
degradation of rupture of membranes in term and preterm gestations.
Maymon et al. (2000) concluded that MMP1 is implicated in the mechanisms
of membrane rupture.

Lahmann et al. (2001) found significantly more MMP1 mRNA in the buttock
skin of smokers than nonsmokers and suggested that smoking-induced MMP1
might be important in the skin-aging effects of tobacco smoking.

Saffarian et al. (2004) showed that activated collagenase (MMP1) moves
processively on the collagen fibril. The mechanism of movement is a
biased diffusion with the bias component dependent on the proteolysis of
its substrate, not ATP hydrolysis. Inactivation of the enzyme by a
single amino acid residue substitution in the active center eliminated
the bias without noticeable effect on rate of diffusion. Monte Carlo
simulations using a model similar to a 'burnt bridge' Brownian ratchet
accurately described the experimental result and previous observations
on kinetics of collagen digestion. Saffarian et al. (2004) concluded
that the biologic implications of MMP1 acting as a molecular ratchet
tethered to the cell surface suggested novel mechanisms for its role in
tissue remodeling and cell-matrix interaction.

Boire et al. (2005) found that expression of PAR1 (F2R; 187930) was both
required and sufficient to promote growth and invasion of breast
carcinoma cells in a xenograft mouse model. MMP1 acted as a protease
agonist of PAR1, cleaving the receptor at the proper site to generate
PAR1-dependent Ca(2+) signals and migration. MMP1 activity was derived
from fibroblasts and was absent from the breast cancer cells. These
results demonstrated that MMP1 in the stromal-tumor microenvironment can
alter the behavior of cancer cells through PAR1 to promote cell
migration and invasion.

By in vivo selection, transcriptomic analysis, functional verification,
and clinical validation, Minn et al. (2005) identified a set of genes
that marks and mediates breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Some of
these genes serve dual functions, providing growth advantages both in
the primary tumor and in the lung microenvironment. Others contribute to
aggressive growth selectivity in the lung. Among the lung metastasis
signature genes identified, several, including MMP1 (p less than
0.000001), were functionally validated. Two that were not functionally
validated but that achieved the highest statistical significance (p less
than 0.000001) were FSCN1 (602689) and angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4;
605910). Those subjects expressing the lung metastasis signature had a
significantly poorer lung metastasis-free survival, but not bone
metastasis-free survival, compared to subjects without the signature.

Metastasis entails numerous biologic functions that collectively enable
cancerous cells from a primary site to disseminate and overtake distant
organs. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, Gupta et al. (2007)
showed that the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand epiregulin
(602061), the cyclooxygenase COX2 (600262), and the matrix
metalloproteinases MMP1 and MMP2 (120360), when expressed in human
breast cancer cells, collectively facilitate the assembly of new tumor
blood vessels, the release of tumor cells into the circulation, and the
breaching of lung capillaries by circulating tumor cells to seed
pulmonary metastasis. Gupta et al. (2007) concluded that their findings
revealed how aggressive primary tumorigenic functions can be
mechanistically coupled to greater lung metastatic potential, and how
such biologic activities can be therapeutically targeted with specific
drug combinations.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Joos et al. (2002) found an association between a 1-bp insertion in the
MMP1 gene (G-1607GG; dbSNP rs1799750; 120353.0001) and the rate of
decline of lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD;
606963).

Fujimoto et al. (2002) analyzed the G-1607GG promoter polymorphism in
the MMP1 gene in 75 African American infants who were born after preterm
premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM; 610504) and 235 controls, and
found a significant association between fetal carriage of a 2G allele
and PPROM (OR = 2.29; p = 0.028).

In studies in amnion fibroblasts, Wang et al. (2008) found that
inhibition of DNA methylation resulted in significantly increased MMP1
gene transcription and an associated significant increase in MMP1
production. These effects were correlated with reduced DNA methylation
at a specific site, -1538C, in the MMP1 promoter, and DNA methylation at
that site was reduced in a larger percentage of fetal membranes that
ruptured prematurely. The authors identified another SNP, 3447T-C
(numbering based on AF007878.1; dbSNP rs2075847), and observed that the
minor C allele was always methylated in vivo and that methylation
resulted in increased affinity for a nuclear protein in amnion
fibroblasts. Plasmid transfection studies and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated reduced promoter activity of the
minor C allele. In a case-control study involving 284 African American
neonates from pregnancies complicated by PPROM and 361 African American
neonates from normal term pregnancies, Wang et al. (2008) found the
minor C allele to be protective against PPROM (OR = 0.7451; p = 0.0326),
consistent with its reduced promoter function. Neonates homozygous for
the major T allele had 3.51-higher risk for PPROM compared to CC
homozygotes (p = 0.007). Wang et al. (2008) concluded that, in addition
to genetic variation, DNA methylation plays a role in controlling MMP1
expression and risk of PPROM.

Titeux et al. (2008) demonstrated that the G-1607GG polymorphism in MMP1
results in transcriptional upregulation. They found a significant
association between this SNP and disease severity among patients with
autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB; 226600).

Rutter et al. (1998) identified a SNP (dbSNP rs1799750) in the promoter
region of the MMP1 gene (position -1607) where an additional guanine
nucleotide creates a binding site for members of the Ets family of
transcription factors. The 2G SNP displayed significantly higher
transcription in normal fibroblasts and in melanoma cells compared to
the 1G SNP. The occurrence of 2G homozygotes was 30% in 100 CEPH
controls; in tumor cell lines it was 62.5%. Rutter et al. (1998)
suggested that increased MMP1 expression contributes to stromal
degradation involved in tumor invasion.

Rate of Decline of Lung Function in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease

Joos et al. (2002) investigated the role of MMP polymorphisms (including
G-1607GG in MMP1 and N357S in MMP12) in the development of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (see 606963). The authors determined the
prevalence of these polymorphisms in 590 continuing smokers chosen from
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Lung Health Study for
having the fastest (284 individuals) and slowest (306 individuals)
5-year rate of decline of lung function. Of 5 polymorphisms among 3 MMP
loci, only G-1607GG was associated with a rate of decline in lung
function. This allele was associated with a fast rate of decline (p =
0.02). However, haplotypes consisting of alleles from the G-1607GG and
N357S polymorphisms were associated with rate of decline of lung
function (p = 0.0007). Joos et al. (2002) concluded that polymorphisms
in the MMP1 and MMP12 genes, but not MMP9, are either causative factors
in smoking-related lung injury or are in linkage disequilibrium with
causative polymorphisms.

Preterm Premature Rupture of the Membranes

Fujimoto et al. (2002) studied the G-1607GG promoter polymorphism in
amnion-derived cells and found that the 2G promoter had more than 2-fold
greater activity than the 1G allele. Induction of MMP1 mRNA by phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was significantly greater in cells with a
1G/2G or 2G/2G genotype compared to cells homozygous for the 1G allele.
Analysis in 75 African American infants who were born after preterm
premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM; 610504) and 235 controls
demonstrated a significant association between fetal carriage of a 2G
allele and PPROM (OR = 2.29; p = 0.028). The authors concluded that the
2G allele has stronger promoter activity in amnion cells, that it
confers increased responsiveness of amnion cells to stimuli that induce
MMP1, and that this polymorphism contributes to the risk of PPROM.

Modifier of Epidermolysis Bullosa Dystrophica

Titeux et al. (2008) demonstrated that the G-1607GG polymorphism (dbSNP
rs1799750) in MMP1 results in transcriptional upregulation. The authors
found a significant association between this SNP and disease severity
among patients with autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa
(RDEB; 226600). In 3 affected sibs and a follow-up cohort of 31
unrelated French patients, the functional SNP resulting in increased
collagenase activity was associated with a more severe phenotype (p =
6.27 x 10(-5)). Titeux et al. (2008) concluded that increased MMP1 leads
to increased collagen degradation and worsening disease severity,
suggesting that MMP1 is a modifier gene in RDEB.

300822	TITLE *300822 OPSIN 1, LONG-WAVE-SENSITIVE; OPN1LW
;;RED CONE PIGMENT; RCP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The long-wave-sensitive opsin-1 gene (OPN1LW) encodes red cone pigment,
1 of 3 light-sensitive pigments that mediate human color vision. The
red-sensitive and green-sensitive (OPN1MW; 300821) opsins comprise a
family of repeated genes on the X chromosome. Whereas there is a single
red pigment gene, green pigment genes vary in number among persons with
normal color vision. The red pigment gene and the multiple green pigment
genes are arranged in a head-to-tail tandem array. The maximal
sensitivity of red cones is 560 nm (Nathans et al., 1986, 1986).

A master switch for the genes of this locus, called the locus control
region (LCR; 300824), is located between 3.1 kb and 3.7 kb 5-prime of
the gene array and has been shown to be essential for expression of both
the red and green pigment genes as well as cone-specific expression of
the genes and their segregated expression in separate cones (summary by
Deeb, 2005).

CLONING

Nathans et al. (1986) isolated and sequenced genomic and cDNA clones
that encode each of the 3 visual pigments. The deduced amino acid
sequences show 41% identity with rhodopsin (180380). The red and green
pigments show 96% mutual identity, but only 43% identity with the blue
pigment (613522). In determining which of the 3 opsin genes corresponded
to each of the 3 cone pigments, Nathans et al. (1986) used the fact that
2 are X-linked and 1 is autosomal. The autosomal one was clearly the
blue cone pigment which is defective in tritan colorblindness (190900);
which of the other genes was for the red pigment and which for the green
was resolved by study of males with red (protan) or green (deutan)
colorblindness.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nathans et al. (1986) determined that the OPN1LW gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

Nathans et al. (1986) mapped the OPN1LW and OPN1MW genes to the distal
part of Xq, tightly linked to each other and to the G6PD gene (305900).

GENE FUNCTION

Visual pigments consist of an apoprotein, opsin, covalently linked to a
small, conjugated chromophore, 11-cis retinal, or in some cases 11-cis
dehydroretinal. Photon absorption by the visual pigments initiates
visual excitation by causing an 11-cis to all-trans isomerization of the
chromophore. Variation in absorption spectra of different visual
pigments is thought to arise from differences in the primary structure
of the apoprotein. Specifically, the visual pigments of the 3 types of
cones that mediate color vision are thought to differ in their
absorption spectra as a result of attachment of 11-cis retinal to 3
structurally distinct cone opsins. A corollary of the hypothesis is that
colorblindness arises from alterations in the genes encoding the cone
opsins. Most humans can match any color by mixing 3 primary colors: red,
green, and blue. Thomas Young (1802) hypothesized that this phenomenon
(trichromacy) is the consequence of humans having 3 independent
light-sensitive mechanisms. It is now known that Young's 3 mechanisms
are embodied in 3 classes of cone photoreceptor cells in the retina.
Each class contains a different visual pigment, which determines the
spectral sensitivity of all the cones of that class. The maximal
sensitivity of red, green, and blue cones is 560 nm, 530 nm, and 420 nm,
respectively (Nathans et al., 1986, 1986; Deeb, 2005).

Light exposure can induce suppression and/or circadian phase shift of
plasma melatonin levels in subjects with normal color vision. To
determine if normal cone photoreceptor systems are necessary for
light-induced melatonin suppression, Ruberg et al. (1996) tested whether
color vision-deficient humans also have light-induced melatonin
suppression. In 1 study, 14 red-green color vision-deficient subjects
and 7 normal controls were exposed to a 90-min, 200-lux, white light
stimulus from 0200-0330 h. Melatonin suppression was observed in
controls (t = -7.04; P less than 0.001), all color vision-deficient
subjects (t = -4.76; P less than 0.001), protanopic observers (t =
-6.23; P less than 0.005), and deuteranopic observers (t = -3.48; P less
than 0.05), with no significant difference in the magnitude of
suppression between groups. These findings suggested that a normal
trichromatic visual system is not necessary for light-mediated
neuroendocrine regulation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nathans et al. (1986) determined that whereas there is a single red
pigment gene, green pigment genes vary in number among persons with
normal color vision. The red pigment gene and the multiple green pigment
genes are arranged in a head-to-tail tandem array, with the red pigment
gene at the 5-prime end. Nathans et al. (1986) suggested that
nonhomologous pairing and unequal crossing-over can explain the
development of protan (red; 303800) and deutan (green; 303900)
colorblindness. Gene conversion may also be involved.

Although there are 15 amino acid differences between the MW (green) and
LW (red) opsins, the greater part of the spectral shift in sensitivity
is the result of substitutions at sites 180, 277, and 285, with 5 other
sites having smaller effects. Site 180 (see 300822.0002) is polymorphic
in both MW and LW opsin genes. The middlewave opsin is missing or
defective in deuteranopia and the longwave opsin in protanopia. Using
refined methods, Neitz and Neitz (1995) reexamined the numbers and
ratios of genes in the Xq28 cluster in men with normal color vision.
Results indicated that many men have more pigment genes on the X
chromosome than had previously been suggested and that many have more
than 1 longwave pigment gene.

In a study of 33 unrelated subjects with blue cone monochromacy
(303700), Nathans et al. (1993) found one subject with a single red
pigment gene carrying an arg247-to-ter mutation (300822.0001). In
another subject, they identified a cys203-to-arg mutation in both the
red pigment (300822.0003) and the green pigment (300821.0002) genes. In
addition, in 14 unrelated BCM probands, Nathans et al. (1993) identified
a single 5-prime red, 3-prime green hybrid gene carrying the C203R
mutation.

In a Danish family with BCM, Ladekjaer-Mikkelsen et al. (1996)
identified an isolated red pigment gene with deletion of exon 4
(300822.0005). The authors stated that this was the first intragenic
deletion reported among the red and green pigment genes and that it
represented a new mechanism underlying the development of BCM.

Ueyama et al. (2002) analyzed DNA in 217 Japanese males with congenital
red/green color vision deficiencies. The normal genotype of a single red
gene, followed by a green gene, was found in 23 subjects. Four of the 23
were from the 69 protan subject groups and 19 of the 23 were from the
148 deutan subject group. Three of the 23 subjects had missense
mutations: asn94-to-lys (300821.0003) in the single green gene of a
deutan subject; arg330-to-gln (300821.0004) in both green genes of
another deutan subject; and gly338-to-glu (300822.0004) in the single
red gene of a protan subject. Both normal and mutant opsins were
expressed in cultured COS-7 cells and visual pigments were regenerated
with 11-cis-retinal. The mutations resulted in no absorbance or a low
absorbance spectrum. Therefore, these 3 mutant opsins probably affected
the folding process, resulting in a loss of function as a visual
pigment.

In a British family segregating X-linked recessive BCM, Michaelides et
al. (2005) identified a single hybrid 5-prime-L/M-3-prime gene
containing the C203R substitution in exon 4 (see 300822.0003).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
BLUE CONE MONOCHROMACY
OPN1LW, ARG247TER

In the male proband from a 4-generation BCM family with 3 affected
individuals, who had been previously studied by Reitner et al. (1991)
(patient 'MP'), Nathans et al. (1993) identified a single red pigment
gene carrying a C-T transition in exon 4, resulting in an arg247-to-ter
(R247X) substitution.

.0002
RED CONE POLYMORPHISM
OPN1LW, SER180ALA

Genetic variation of human senses within the normal range probably
exists but usually cannot be investigated in detail for lack of
appropriate methods. Subtle perceptual differences in red-green vision
can be studied, however, since both photo-pigment genotypes and
psychophysical phenotypes can be assessed by sophisticated techniques.
Color matches of males with normal color vision fall into 2 main groups
that appear to be transmitted by X-linked inheritance. This difference
in color matching is likely to reflect small variations in the
absorption maxima of visual pigments, suggesting the presence of 2
common variants of the red and/or green visual pigments that differ in
spectral positioning. Winderickx et al. (1992) reported a common single
amino acid polymorphism (62% ser, 38% ala) at residue 180 of the RCP
gene, explaining the finding of 2 major groups in the distribution of
color matching among males with normal color vision.

.0003
BLUE CONE MONOCHROMACY
OPN1LW AND OPN1MW, CYS203ARG

In the male proband from a 3-generation family with 8 individuals with
blue cone monochromacy (303700), Nathans et al. (1993) identified a
cys203-to-arg (C203R) mutation in both the RCP and the GCP (300821.0002)
genes. In addition, in 14 unrelated BCM probands, Nathans et al. (1993)
identified a single 5-prime red, 3-prime green hybrid gene carrying the
C203R mutation.

Reyniers et al. (1995) described a family with BCM due to the presence
of a C203R mutation in both RCP and GCP. The flanking sequences of the
C203R mutation in exon 4 of RCP were characteristic for GCP, indicating
that this mutation was transferred from GCP into RCP by gene conversion.

In a British family segregating X-linked recessive BCM, Michaelides et
al. (2005) identified a single hybrid 5-prime-L/M-3-prime gene, which
was the result of recombination within intron 4, with a C203R
substitution in exon 4.

.0004
COLORBLINDNESS, PROTAN
RCP, GLY338GLU

In a person with protan colorblindness (303900), Ueyama et al. (2002)
found a gly338-to-glu (GGG to GAG; G338E) mutation in the single red
pigment gene. The mutant opsin showed no absorbance.

.0005
BLUE CONE MONOCHROMACY
OPN1LW, EX2DEL

In the proband of a Danish family with blue cone monochromacy (303700),
Ladekjaer-Mikkelsen et al. (1996) identified a single red pigment gene
in which exon 4 had been deleted. The same deletion was found in a
maternal half-brother with BCM and their unaffected carrier mother,
whereas the deletion was not found in a brother with normal color
vision. The deletion was predicted to generate a premature stop codon,
resulting in a protein that lacks the final 3 of 7 transmembrane
alpha-helices, including the lysine at codon 312 where 11-cis retinal
covalently attaches to normal pigment.

611854	TITLE *611854 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L50; MRPL50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL50
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl50 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL50. They also identified MRPL50 homologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast, E. coli, or Arabidopsis.
Mouse and human MRPL50 share 77.9% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003) mapped the
MRPL50 gene to chromosome 9q31.1. They identified MRPL50 pseudogenes on
chromosomes 2, 5, and 10.

RED BLOOD CELL ANTIGEN MER 2; MER2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transmembrane 4 (4TM) superfamily proteins are membrane proteins with 4
conserved transmembrane domains. Fitter et al. (1995) showed that the
platelet surface glycoprotein gp27 identified by Ashman et al. (1991) is
a member of this group. Fitter et al. (1995) cloned the gp27 gene,
designated PETA3 by them, by sequencing purified protein and using the
resulting probes in RT-PCR to obtain a cDNA from megakaryoblastic cells.
Fitter et al. (1995) assigned this 253-amino acid protein to the 4TM
group because it has 4 predicted hydrophobic regions and 30% homology to
other members of the group. Northern blot analysis showed that PETA3 is
expressed in most tissues, but not in brain. Hasegawa et al. (1996)
cloned the same gene, which they named SFA1, during a screen for genes
induced by HTLV-1 transformation in T cells. The 62-bp difference
between the 5-prime untranslated regions of the PETA3 and SFA1 cDNAs was
ascribed to alternative splicing in an erratum to Hasegawa et al.
(1996).

Bill et al. (1987) cloned the MER2 (179620) gene using a strategy that
involved cotransfection of resistance to an antibiotic.

GENE FUNCTION

Hemidesmosomes are specialized junctional complexes that function as
cell-attachment sites for binding to basement membranes. They appear as
electron-dense structures, resembling half a desmosome. Alpha-6 (ITGA6;
147556)/beta-4 (ITGB4; 147557) integrin is a major component of
hemidesmosomes. In addition to ITGA6/ITGB4, classic type I
hemidesmosomes contain BP180 (COL17A1; 113811) and BP230 (BPAG1;
113810), while type II hemidesmosomes, which are found in cylindrical
epithelia, contain plectin (601282). Using immunohistochemistry and
immunoelectron microscopy, Sterk et al. (2000) identified CD151, but not
the tetraspanins CD9 (143030) or CD81 (186845), codistributed with
ITGA6/ITGB4 in hemidesmosomes but not desmosomes at the basolateral
surfaces of basal keratinocytes. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot
analysis showed that CD151 associates with ITGA6/ITGB4 and with ITGA3
(605025)/ITGB1 (135630), but not with ITGA5 (135620)/ITGB1. In pyloric
atresia-junctional epidermolysis bullosa (PA-JEB; 226730) cells lacking
ITGB4 (thus lacking hemidesmosomes), CD151 colocalized with ITGA3/ITGB1.
Expression of ITGB4 in PA-JEB cells induced surface expression of
ITGA6/ITGB4 in hemidesmosomes together with CD151 and the apparent
replacement of ITGA3/ITGB1. Fluorescent microscopy showed that CD151 is
a component of both type I and type II hemidesmosomes. The authors
demonstrated that recruitment of CD151 requires the heterodimerization
of ITGB4 with ITGA6, with which CD151 is associated.

The 4-transmembrane domain superfamily (the tetraspanins) are integral
cell membrane proteins comprising at least 28 members in mammals.
Tetraspanins are widely distributed on animal cells, and several are
known to be expressed on human hematopoietic cells, including CD151.
Tetraspanin CD151 forms very stable laminin-binding complexes with
integrins alpha-3-beta-1 (605025; 135630) and alpha-6-beta-1 (147556;
135630) in kidney and alpha-3-beta-1 and alpha-6-beta-4 (147558; 147557)
in skin. Karamatic Crew et al. (2004) demonstrated that CD151 expresses
the MER2 blood group antigen and is located on erythrocytes.

CD151 is highly expressed in megakaryocytes and, to a lesser extent, in
platelets. Using Cd151-deficient mice, Lau et al. (2004) provided the
first direct evidence that CD151 is essential for normal platelet
function and that disruption of CD151 induces a moderate outside-in
integrin alpha-IIb-beta-3 (see 607759, 173470) signaling defect.

GENE STRUCTURE

By PCR and genomic sequence analyses, Whittock and McLean (2001)
determined that the CD151 gene contains 8 exons spanning 4.3 kb, with
exons 2 to 8 encoding the CD151 protein. They also described a PCR-based
mutation-detection strategy to facilitate identification of pathogenic
mutations in patients with fragile skin and mucous membranes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Karamatic Crew et al. (2004) studied the CD151 gene in 3 patients who
were negative for the blood group antigen MER2 (179620), which is
expressed by the CD151 tetraspanin. The patients were of Indian Jewish
origin and had end-stage kidney disease. In addition to hereditary
nephritis, the sibs had sensorineural deafness, pretibial epidermolysis
bullosa, and beta-thalassemia minor. All 3 patients were homozygous for
a single-nucleotide insertion in exon 5 of CD151, causing a frameshift
and premature stop signal at codon 140 (602243.0001). The resultant
truncated protein would lack its integrin-binding domain. Karamatic Crew
et al. (2004) concluded that CD151 is essential for the proper assembly
of the glomerular and tubular basement membrane in kidney, has
functional significance in the skin, is probably a component of the
inner ear, and could play a role in erythropoiesis, as suggested by the
presence of beta-thalassemia minor.

MAPPING

Hasegawa et al. (1997) mapped the PETA3 gene to 11p15.5 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization. Whittock and McLean (2001) confirmed that the
CD151 gene maps to 11p15.5 by radiation hybrid analysis.

Daniels et al. (1987) assigned the MER2 locus to 11p15 by study of
somatic cell hybrids.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wright et al. (2004) generated mice with a homozygous deletion of all 6
coding exons of the Cd151 gene. The Cd151 -/- mice were viable, fertile,
and healthy, with normal blood and marrow cell counts and normal tissue
morphology and integrin expression in skin. However, the mice had a
minor abnormality in hemostasis, with longer bleeding times, greater
blood loss, and increased incidence of spontaneous tail vein rebleeding.
Cd151 -/- keratinocytes migrated poorly in skin explant cultures, and
mutant lymphocytes were hyperproliferative after mitogen stimulation in
vitro. Wright et al. (2004) noted that other tetraspanin deletion
mutants produce mild phenotypes and suggested that this may be due to
complementation by other tetraspanins or that these proteins function as
modifiers rather than as essential components of the molecular complexes
in which they participate.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEPHROPATHY WITH PRETIBIAL EPIDERMOLYSIS BULLOSA AND DEAFNESS
CD151, 1-BP INS, G383

In 3 MER2-negative patients of Indian Jewish origin with end-stage
kidney disease (609057), Karamatic Crew et al. (2004) found homozygosity
for a single-nucleotide insertion (G383) in exon 5 of the CD151 gene,
causing a frameshift and premature stop signal in codon 140. The
resultant truncated protein would lack its integrin-binding domain. The
findings suggested that CD151 is essential for the proper assembly of
the glomerular and tubular basement membrane in kidney, as well as
having functional significance in skin and probably the inner ear.

142560	TITLE *142560 DEAD BOX POLYPEPTIDE 39B; DDX39B
;;HLA-B-ASSOCIATED TRANSCRIPT 1; BAT1;;
U2AF65-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 56-KD; UAP56;;
D6S81E
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

UAP56 (BAT1) is an essential splicing factor that is recruited to the
pre-mRNA dependent on U2AF65 (191318) and is required for the U2
snRNP-branchpoint interaction. UAP56 is a member of the DEAD box family
of RNA-dependent ATPases, which mediate ATP hydrolysis during several
steps of pre-mRNA splicing (Fleckner et al., 1997).

CLONING

By chromosome walking with overlapping cosmids, Spies et al. (1989)
isolated a 435-kb DNA segment that was centromeric to HLA-B (142830) in
the human major histocompatibility complex. The presence of additional
genes was suggested by a large cluster of CpG islands. With cosmid
probes, 5 distinct transcripts were detected in RNA samples from a
variety of cell lines, and the corresponding cDNA clones were isolated
and designated 'HLA-B-associated transcripts' (BAT1 through BAT5,
142620).

Peelman et al. (1995) sequenced both human and pig BAT1 and showed that
the genes are members of the DEAD-box family of ATP-dependent RNA
helicases, which are involved in a number of cellular functions
including initiation of translation, RNA splicing, and ribosome
assembly. Proteins of this family have 9 conserved amino acid motifs but
differ at their amino and carboxyl ends. From studies of other family
members, the first block is involved in ATP binding, the fifth block may
be an ATPase, the sixth block is needed for RNA helicase activity, and
the ninth block is involved with ATP hydrolysis-independent RNA
interactions during unwinding. The gene contains 10 exons spanning about
10 kb of genomic DNA and encodes a 428-amino acid protein. Peelman et
al. (1995) detected 3 different length mRNAs (4.1, 17, and 0.9 kb) in
all tissues analyzed, although at different relative levels. The protein
is highly conserved, with 98% identity to the p47 rat liver nuclear
protein and 99% identity to the pig BAT1 homolog. Peelman et al. (1995)
showed that a recombinant epitope-tagged BAT1 construct was expressed in
COS cells and showed localization of the protein to the nucleus.

Fleckner et al. (1997) cloned a human 56-kD U2AF65-associated protein
that they termed UAP56. Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Fleckner et al.
(1997) identified UAP56 as the splicing factor that interacts with
U2AF65 amino acids 138 to 183. UAP56 encodes a protein of 428 amino
acids containing the 7 consensus motifs characteristic of DEAD box RNA
helicases.

GENE FUNCTION

Spies et al. (1989) raised the question of whether variation at one of
the BAT genes, rather than at HLA-B itself, determines susceptibility to
ankylosing spondylitis (106300).

Allcock et al. (2001) used antisense DNA corresponding to exons 2
through 5 of the BAT1 gene and showed that after antigenic stimulation,
monocytic and T-cell lines produced higher levels of the acute phase
cytokines TNF, interleukin-1 (IL1; see 147760), and IL6 (147620) than
cells containing the transfecting vector alone. These results suggested
that BAT1 is a negative regulator of inflammation.

Fleckner et al. (1997) demonstrated that UAP56 is an essential splicing
factor that is required for U2 snRNP-branchpoint interaction. It is a
component of the spliceosome. Luo et al. (2001) demonstrated that UAP56
interacts directly and highly specifically with ALY (THOC4; 604171).
Moreover, UAP56 is present together with ALY in a spliced mRNA-protein
complex (mRNP). Excess UAP56 is a potent dominant-negative inhibitor of
mRNA export. Excess UAP56 also inhibits the recruitment of ALY to the
spliced mRNP. Furthermore, mutation in ALY that blocks its interaction
with UAP56 prevents recruitment of ALY to the spliced mRNP. Luo et al.
(2001) concluded that the splicing factor UAP56 functions in coupling
the splicing and export machineries by recruiting ALY to the spliced
mRNP.

Strasser et al. (2002) showed that UAP56 is part of the RNase-resistant
TREX (transcription/export) complex, which includes TEX1 (THOC3;
606929), HPR1 (THOC1; 606930), THO2 (THOC2; 300395), and ALY and is
conserved from yeast to humans. Functional studies in yeast led them to
conclude that the TREX complex is specifically recruited to the
transcribing gene and travels with the polymerase during transcriptional
elongation. Strasser et al. (2002) suggested that it physically links
proteins that function in mRNA export or transcription.

Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis of HeLa cell
nuclear extracts, Masuda et al. (2005) found that the human TREX complex
contained THO2, FSAP79 (THOC5; 612733), HPR1, UAP56, TEX1, FSAP35
(THOC6; 615403), ALY, and FSAP24 (THOC7; 611965). Immunodepletion and
gel-filtration analyses revealed that THO2, HPR1, FSAP79, FSAP35, and
FSAP24 were tightly associated in the THO complex, whereas UAP56, ALY,
and TEX1 were more loosely associated. Immunoprecipitation of any TREX
component efficiently immunoprecipitated spliced mRNA and cDNA
transcripts, but not unspliced pre-mRNAs. Immunodepletion of any
component had no effect on spliceosome assembly, splicing, or RNA
stability. The TREX complex assembled on every mRNA examined. Mutation
analysis showed that the C terminus of ALY was required for binding of
both UAP56 and the THO complex. The C terminus of UAP56 was sufficient
for ALY binding. The N terminus of UAP56 interacted weakly with the THO
complex and TEX1, suggesting that other regions of UAP56 are required
for maximal binding. Masuda et al. (2005) concluded that recruitment of
the human TREX complex is not directly coupled to transcription, as in
yeast.

GENE STRUCTURE

Peelman et al. (1995) demonstrated that the BAT1 gene contains 10 exons
spanning about 10 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By chromosome walking with overlapping cosmids, Spies et al. (1989)
isolated a 435-kb DNA segment that is centromeric to HLA-B in the human
major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6p21. Within the cloned
region, the genes for the tumor necrosis factors (TNFA, 191160; TNFB,
153440) and HLA-B (142830) were 210 kb apart. The human homolog of the
mouse gene B144 (LST1; 109170) is located near TNFA. The presence of
additional genes was suggested by a large cluster of CpG islands. With
cosmid probes, 5 distinct transcripts were detected in RNA samples from
a variety of cell lines and the corresponding cDNA clones were isolated.
These 'HLA-B-associated transcripts' (BAT1-BAT5) mapped to different
locations within a 160-kb region that included the TNFA and TNFB genes.

In the pig, BAT1 was shown to be about 30 kb upstream of TNF (Nunes et
al., 1994). The location of BAT1 at the telomeric end of the class III
region is conserved in both humans and pig (Peelman et al., 1995).

603871	TITLE *603871 BY THE RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S6 GENE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG-LIKE; BYSL
;;BYSTIN
DESCRIPTION Trophinin (300132) and tastin (603872) form a cell adhesion molecule
complex that may be involved in mediating the initial attachment of the
blastocyst to uterine epithelial cells at the time of implantation.
However, Suzuki et al. (1998) found that trophinin and tastin do not
bind to each other directly in vitro or in yeast 2-hybrid assays. By
using an expression assay, these authors isolated a cDNA that allowed
COS-1 cells expressing trophinin to adhere to the upper surfaces of
SNG-M endometrial adenocarcinoma cells. The cDNA encoded a predicted
306-amino acid protein that they named 'bystin' because it is 53%
identical to Drosophila bys (symbolizing 'by the ribosomal protein S6
gene'), or mrr (myosin rod-related), protein. Bystin has an apparent
molecular weight of 35 kD. Northern blot analysis revealed that bystin
is expressed as a 2-kb major transcript and a 3.6-kb minor transcript in
SNG-M cells and in human trophoblastic teratocarcinoma HT-H cells. Using
yeast 2- and 3-hybrid assays and in vitro protein binding assays, Suzuki
et al. (1998) determined that bystin binds directly to trophinin and
tastin, and that this binding is enhanced when cytokeratins 8 (148060)
and 18 (148070) are present. Immunocytochemistry of HT-H cells showed
that bystin colocalizes with trophinin, tastin, and the cytokeratins.
The authors suggested that these molecules form a complex in
trophectoderm cells at the time of implantation. Using
immunohistochemistry, Suzuki et al. (1999) determined that trophinin and
bystin are found in the placenta from the sixth week of pregnancy. Both
proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast in
the chorionic villi and in endometrial decidual cells at the
uteroplacental interface. After week 10, the levels of trophinin,
tastin, and bystin decreased and then disappeared from placental villi.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Pack et al. (1998) mapped the
bystin gene to 6p21.1.

604472	TITLE *604472 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR LIGAND SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 13; TNFSF13
;;APRIL;;
TNF- AND APOL-RELATED LEUKOCYTE EXPRESSED LIGAND 2; TALL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands play
important roles in various physiologic and pathologic processes,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death, and modulation
of immune responses. By screening EST databases, Hahne et al. (1998)
cloned a novel TNF cDNA, TNFSF13, which they called APRIL, for 'a
proliferation-inducing ligand.' The full-length cDNA TNFSF13 clone
encodes a 250-amino acid protein with a predicted 28-amino acid
cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and an
extracellular domain of 201 amino acids with no signal peptide. There is
only 1 N-linked glycosylation site. The sequence of the extracellular
domain shows 21% homology with TNFSF6 (134638) and 20% homology with
TNFA (191160). Northern blot analysis revealed weak expression
restricted to a few tissues: transcripts of 2.1 and 2.4 kb in prostate
and a transcript of 1.8 kb in peripheral blood leukocytes. All tumor
cell lines, however, strongly expressed the TNFSF13 2.1-kb transcript,
and expression of extracellular or full-length TNFSF13 led to increased
proliferation of various cell lines.

Shu et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they designated TALL2.
TALL2 shares about 35% sequence identity with TALL1 (BLYS, or TNFSF13B;
603969) in the C terminus.

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK (TNFSF12; 602695) to exons 2 through 6 of
APRIL. See 602695 for further information on the protein encoded by the
TWEAK/APRIL transcript, which Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) called
TWEPRIL.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Seyler et al. (2005) analyzed synovial tissue specimens from 72 patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (180300) for TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B production
and TNFSF13/TNFSF13B receptor expression. Synovitis with ectopic
germinal centers present had the highest levels of TNFSF13, produced
exclusively by CD83 (604534)-positive dendritic cells; TNFSF13B was
present in similar levels in all types of synovitis (with or without
germinal centers or T cell-B cell aggregates) and was produced
exclusively from CD68 (153634)-positive macrophages. In synovitis with
germinal centers, inhibiting TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B with a TACI
(TNFRSF13B; 604907):Fc fusion protein resulted in destruction of the
germinal centers and marked inhibition of IFN-gamma (147570) and Ig
transcription, whereas similar inhibition in the aggregate and diffuse
types of synovitis enhanced IFN-gamma production and did not affect Ig
levels. These differential immunomodulatory effects correlated with the
presence of TACI-positive T cells in aggregate and diffuse synovitis and
their absence in synovitis with germinal centers. Seyler et al. (2005)
proposed that TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B regulate B-cell as well as T-cell
function and have both pro- and antiinflammatory effects in rheumatoid
arthritis.

Both BLYS and APRIL have been described as homotrimeric molecules, a
feature common to many members of the TNF superfamily. Using ELISA
analysis, Roschke et al. (2002) found that patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700), rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, psoriatic
arthritis (see 607507), polymyositis (see 160750), and ankylosing
spondylitis (106300) had significantly higher levels of BLYS/APRIL
heterotrimers than did controls. Roschke et al. (2002) proposed that
BLYS/APRIL heterotrimers may play a role in rheumatic and other
autoimmune diseases, and that other members of the TNF ligand
superfamily may also form active soluble heterotrimers.

Using cell-based, biochemical, and structural studies, Hymowitz et al.
(2005) characterized interactions between APRIL and TACI. They found
that the short isoform of human TACI, which lacks cysteine-rich domain-1
(CRD1), was still functional for signaling and that CRD2 of TACI was
sufficient for high-affinity binding to either murine April or human
BAFF (TNFSF13B). The solution structure of CRD2 of TACI revealed a
compact domain and additional ligand-binding determinants. Cocrystal
structures of murine April bound to CRD2 of human TACI or to human BCMA
(TNFRSF17; 109545) showed large interfaces and revealed key differences
that likely influence ligand-binding affinity and specificity.

Ingold et al. (2005) showed that the TNF homology domain of mouse and
human APRIL bound BCMA and TACI, whereas a basic sequence (QKQKKQ) close
to the N terminus of the mature protein bound negatively charged
sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Although T-cell
lines bound little APRIL, ectopic expression of glycosaminoglycan-rich
syndecans (see SDC1; 186355) or glypicans (see GPC1; 600395) conferred
on these cells a high binding capacity that was completely dependent on
the N-terminal basic sequence of APRIL. Moreover, SDC1-positive plasma
cells and proteoglycan-rich nonhematopoietic cells displayed high
specific, heparin-sensitive binding to APRIL. Inhibition of BAFF and
APRIL, but not BAFF alone, prevented survival and/or migration of newly
formed plasma cells to bone marrow. In addition, costimulation of B-cell
proliferation by APRIL was only effective upon APRIL oligomerization.
Ingold et al. (2005) proposed that APRIL binding to the extracellular
matrix or to proteoglycan-positive cells induces APRIL oligomerization,
which is the prerequisite for triggering TACI- and/or BCMA-mediated
activation, migration, and survival signals.

Using flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemical
analysis, Huard et al. (2008) found that APRIL was expressed on
recruited neutrophils and accumulated on subepithelial heparan sulfate
proteoglycans in upper (e.g., tonsils) and lower (e.g., lamina propria)
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and contributed to survival of
plasma cells. Mice lacking April had less-persistent mucosal humoral
immunity. Huard et al. (2008) proposed that inflammation-recruited
neutrophils may create plasma cell niches in MALT to sustain local
antibody production.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF13 gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the transcriptional start
site of the TNFSF13 gene lies 878 bp downstream of the TNFSF12 gene on
chromosome 17p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

By treating mice with TACI-Ig, Gross et al. (2001) determined that BLYS
and APRIL are required for the development of both transitional (T2) and
mature B lymphocytes. TACI-Ig-treated mice also had less circulating
immunoglobulin and produced less collagen-specific antibody. TACI-Ig
treatment inhibited the development of collagen-induced rheumatoid
arthritis. Gross et al. (2001) proposed that TACI-Ig may have a role in
both the prevention and treatment of autoimmune disease mediated by
pathogenic autoantibodies.

Stein et al. (2002) created mice expressing human APRIL as a transgene
in T cells. These mice appeared normal. Transgenic T cells showed
enhanced survival in vitro and enhanced survival of staphylococcal
enterotoxin B-reactive Cd4-positive T cells in vivo, and both of these
responses correlated with elevated Bcl2 levels. Analysis of humoral
responses to T cell-dependent antigens in the transgenic mice indicated
that APRIL affected IgM responses, but not IgG responses. In contrast, T
cell-independent type-2 (TI-2) humoral responses were enhanced in APRIL
transgenic mice. As TACI had been reported to be indispensable for TI-2
antibody formation, Stein et al. (2002) concluded that APRIL-TACI
interactions have a role in generating the TI-2 response and that APRIL
is involved in the induction and/or maintenance of T- and B-cell
responses.

To investigate the role of APRIL in immunity, Castigli et al. (2004)
generated April-deficient mice. April -/- mice had normal T and B
lymphocyte development, normal T and B cell proliferation in vitro, but
increased numbers of CD4+ effector/memory T cells and increased IgG
responses to T-dependent antigens. Serum IgA levels were significantly
decreased, and serum IgA antibody responses to mucosal immunization with
T-dependent antigens and to type 1 T-independent antigens were impaired
in April -/- mice. The results suggested that APRIL downregulates T
cell-dependent antibody responses and promotes IgA class switching.

605276	TITLE *605276 APOPTOSIS-ASSOCIATED TYROSINE KINASE; AATK
;;AATYK
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By randomly selecting cDNA clones from size-fractionated human brain
cDNA libraries, Ishikawa et al. (1998) identified a full-length cDNA
clone, which they called KIAA0641, encoding a protein with significant
homology to the mouse Aatyk protein identified by Gaozza et al. (1997).
The deduced human AATK protein contains 1,207 amino acids and has an
observed molecular mass greater than 100 kD. By RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al.
(1998) detected expression of AATK in brain, lung, kidney, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

From studies of the mouse Aatyk gene, Gaozza et al. (1997) hypothesized
that Aatyk is a necessary prerequisite for the induction of growth
arrest and/or apoptosis of myeloid precursor cells. They found that
expression of Aatyk is dramatically upregulated during apoptotic death
of 32D bone marrow-derived cells during IL3 (147740) deprivation as well
as during GCSF (138970)-induced terminal differentiation of 32D cells.
Additionally, the expression of Aatyk is blocked in v-abl or bcr-abl
transformed myeloid cells, which are unable to apoptose when deprived of
IL3.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the AATK
gene to chromosome 17. By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Seki et
al. (1999) refined the localization to 17q25.3

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the sequences of EXT1 (608177), EXT2
(608210), and EXTL1 (601738), followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE,
Saito et al. (1998) cloned full-length cDNAs for 2 new members of the
EXT family, EXTL2 (602411) and EXTL3, which they called EXTR2 and EXTR1,
respectively. The deduced 919-amino acid EXTL3 protein contains a highly
conserved region in the C terminus common to other EXT proteins.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of 6.2- and 4.7-kb EXTR1
transcripts in all tissues tested except ovary. The larger transcript
was predominant in brain, skeletal muscle, and testis, and the shorter
transcript in heart, liver, thymus, and prostate.

Kobayashi et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA for a REG protein (see 167770)
receptor from a rat islet cDNA library. Cells into which the cDNA had
been introduced bound REG protein with high affinity. When the cDNA was
introduced into a pancreatic beta-cell line that showed REG-dependent
growth, the transformants exhibited a significant increase in the
incorporation of 5-prime-bromo-2-prime-deoxyuridine as well as in the
cell numbers in response to REG protein. A homology search revealed that
the rat REG protein receptor cDNA is a homolog of EXTL3. The rat and
human proteins share 97% sequence identity. Kobayashi et al. (2000)
found that REG receptor mRNA in the rat is detectable in liver, kidney,
stomach, small intestine, colon, adrenal gland, pituitary gland, and
brain, but not in heart, suggesting the possible involvement of the
REG-REG protein receptor signal system in a variety of cell types other
than pancreatic beta cells.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Saito et al.
(1998) mapped the human EXTL3 gene to chromosome 8p21. By FISH,
radiation hybrid analysis, and inclusion within a mapped contig, Van Hul
et al. (1998) mapped the gene to 8p21-p12.

;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 30; GPR30;;
CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR-LIKE 2; CMKRL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Owman et al. (1996) performed PCR of template DNA from human B-cell
lymphoblasts using degenerate primers to G protein-coupled receptors.
They identified a full-length cDNA encoding a 375-amino acid protein,
which they termed CMKRL2. CMKRL2 is expressed in the Burkitt lymphoma
cell lines Raji and Daudi but not in T-cell lymphoma Jurkat cells, T- or
B-cell leukemias, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or other cancer cell
lines (Owman et al., 1996). Northern blot analysis of normal tissue
showed expression of a 2.4-kb transcript in many tissues including the
brain; there was no detectable mRNA in placenta, bone marrow, or
peripheral blood leukocytes (Owman et al., 1996).

Using the technique of differential cDNA library screening to identify
genes overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ESR)-positive breast carcinoma
cell lines compared to ESR-negative cell lines, Carmeci et al. (1997)
isolated a CMKRL2 cDNA and designated it GPR30. Sequence analysis
determined that the clone shares significant homology to G
protein-coupled receptors. This receptor was abundantly expressed in 3
ESR-positive breast carcinoma cell lines. Expression was absent or
minimal in 3 ESR-negative breast carcinoma cell lines. It was
ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues examined, but was most
abundant in placenta. In 11 primary breast carcinomas, it was detected
in all 4 ESR-positive tumors and in only 1 of 7 ESR-negative tumors. The
pattern of expression of the gene indicated that the receptor may be
involved in physiologic responses specific to hormonally responsive
tissues.

Using PCR with degenerate primers to identify novel members of the G
protein-coupled receptor family, Feng and Gregor (1997) also cloned
GPR30. They designated the gene CEPR for 'constitutively/commonly
expressed peptide-like receptor' because the 3.3-kb mRNA was detected in
most human tissues on Northern blots. They found that CEPR is encoded by
an intronless gene. Similarly, Kvingedal and Smeland (1997) cloned GPR30
using RT-PCR of B-cell mRNA to identify G protein-coupled receptors
expressed in lymphocytes. They designated the gene LyGPR for
'lymphocyte-derived G protein-coupled receptor.' Takada et al. (1997)
cloned GPR30 from endothelial cells exposed to fluid shear stress. They
designated the gene FEG1 for 'flow-induced endothelial G protein-coupled
receptor gene-1.'

GENE FUNCTION

Revankar et al. (2005) found that unlike other known G protein-coupled
receptors, GPR30 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it
specifically binds estrogen and estrogen derivatives. Activating GPR30
by estrogen resulted in intracellular calcium mobilization and synthesis
of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the nucleus. Revankar et
al. (2005) concluded that GPR30 represents an intracellular
transmembrane estrogen receptor that may contribute to normal estrogen
physiology as well as pathophysiology. Pietras et al. (2005) questioned
the conclusions raised by Revankar et al. (2005); Prossnitz et al.
(2005) provided a response.

MAPPING

Owman et al. (1996) mapped the CMKRL2 gene to 7p22 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Based upon PCR analysis in somatic hybrid cell

300512	TITLE *300512 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 13; WDR13
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a human testis cDNA library, Singh et al. (2003) cloned
WDR13. The deduced 485-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 53 kD. The N-terminal domain of WDR13 contains several consensus
phosphorylation sites, and the C terminus contains 6 WD repeats. Singh
et al. (2003) also identified a splice variant that encodes a 393-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 43 kD. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of transcripts at about 3.0 and
2.0 kb in all tissues examined. RNA dot blot analysis confirmed
widespread expression in adult and fetal tissues. Transfection of the
WDR13 splice variants in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated
expression of the 53-kD isoform in the nucleus and expression of the
43-kD isoform in both cytoplasm and nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Singh et al. (2003) determined that the WDR13 gene contains 9 exons and
spans 7.3 kb. The promoter region contains a GC box and binding sites
for AP1 (see JUN, 165160), SP1 (189906), and GATA1 (305371).

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Singh et al. (2003) mapped the
WDR13 gene to chromosome Xp11.23.

613358	TITLE *613358 ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 16 FAMILY, MEMBER A1; ALDH16A1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mass spectrometry to identify proteins that coimmunoprecipitated
with maspardin (ACP33; 608181) from HeLa cell lysates, followed by
database analysis, Hanna and Blackstone (2009) identified ALDH16A1.
Immunohistochemical analysis detected a punctate cytoplasmic ALDH16A1
distribution in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis showed that the
protein had an apparent molecular mass of 85 kD. RT-PCR detected
Aldh16a1 in mouse brain. In situ hybridization of cultured mouse
cortical neurons revealed prominent punctate Aldh16a1 staining in cell
bodies and growth cones.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays, Hanna
and Blackstone (2009) showed that endogenous maspardin and ALDH16A1
interacted directly.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ALDH16A1 gene to chromosome 19q13.33 based on an
alignment of the ALDH16A1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY007096) with the
genomic sequence (GRCH37).

142810	TITLE *142810 HISTIDYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; HARS
;;HRS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

HARS catalyzes the covalent ligation of histidine to its cognate tRNA as
an early step in protein biosynthesis (O'Hanlon and Miller, 2002).

CLONING

O'Hanlon et al. (1995) noted that HARS and HARS2 (600783), which they
called HO3, are oriented in a head-to-head configuration and share a
bidirectional promoter. They reported that the deduced 509-amino acid
HARS protein shares 72% amino acid identity with HARS2. Both proteins
contain 3 motifs conserved among class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and
2 signature regions of histidyl-tRNA synthetases. However, HARS and
HARS2 have divergent N-terminal domains that are encoded by the first 2
exons of each gene. HARS has a calculated molecular mass of 57.4 kD.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.0-kb HARS transcript that was highly
expressed in heart, brain, liver, and kidney.

Using 5-prime RACE with a human kidney cDNA library, O'Hanlon and Miller
(2002) identified several HARS transcripts that differed only in the
lengths of their 5-prime UTRs. O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) noted that
pufferfish and human HARS proteins share 84% amino acid homology,
suggesting a high degree of conservation.

GENE STRUCTURE

O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) determined that the HARS gene contains 13
exons and spans approximately 17.4 kb. The HARS and HARS2 genes share a
bidirectional promoter that lacks TATA and CAAT boxes. Both genes use
multiple transcriptional start sites. HARS also uses a second, more
distal promoter that overlaps the first exons of the HARS2 gene.

MAPPING

Carlock et al. (1985) used a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line with
mutations in 3 genes, HARS, RPS14 (130620) and CHR (118840), in
interspecies cell hybridization experiments, to assign the HARS gene to
chromosome 5. Wasmuth and Carlock (1986) assigned the HARS gene to
chromosome 5 by use of human-Chinese hamster ovary cell hybrids.

By genomic sequence analysis, O'Hanlon and Miller (2002) mapped the HARS
and HARS2 genes to chromosome 5q31.3. HARS and HARS2 exhibit a
head-to-head orientation, with 344 bp separating their ORFs.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients from Old Order Amish families in Pennsylvania with Usher
syndrome type III mapping to chromosome 5q (USH3B; 614504), Puffenberger
et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the
HARS gene (Y454S; 142810.0001) that was not found in dbSNP 129 or the
1000 Genomes Project. In addition, an Old Order Amish patient from an
unrelated deme in Ontario, Canada, had an identical phenotype and was
homozygous for the same mutation.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIIB
HARS, TYR454SER

In 2 patients from Old Order Amish families in Pennsylvania with Usher
syndrome type IIIB (USH3B; 614504), Puffenberger et al. (2012)
identified homozygosity for a 1361A-C transversion in the HARS gene,
resulting in a tyr454-to-ser (Y454S) substitution in the interface
between the catalytic domain and the anticodon binding domain. A patient
with an identical phenotype from an unrelated Old Order Amish deme in
Ontario, Canada, was also homozygous for the Y454S mutation. The variant
was not found in dbSNP 129 or the 1000 Genomes Project; it was, however,
detected in 7 of 406 Old Order Amish alleles, for a population-specific
allele frequency of 1.72%. (Puffenberger (2012) stated that the correct
population-specific allele frequency data appear in Table 4;
corresponding data in the text are incorrect.)

.0002
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
HARS, ARG137GLN (dbSNP rs191391414)

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to a peripheral neuropathy has not been confirmed.

In a 64-year-old man with a 15-year history of impaired sensation in the
lower extremities and electrophysiologic studies suggestive of an axonal
peripheral neuropathy, Vester et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous
410G-A transition (dbSNP rs191391414) in the HARS gene, resulting in an
arg137-to-gln (R137Q) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the
catalytic core of the enzyme. The patient was ascertained from a larger
cohort of 363 individuals with peripheral neuropathy. The R137Q variant
was also found in 3 of over 13,000 control chromosomes. One of the
control carriers had no evidence of neuropathy at age 57 years.
Generation of a yeast strain with deletion of the Hst1 gene (the
ortholog of HARS) showed that the R137Q variant could not complement the
Hst1 deletion, suggesting that it is a loss-of-function allele.
Expression of the R137Q variant specifically in GABA motor nerves of C.
elegans caused gross morphologic defects in commissural axons, with
failure to reach the dorsal nerve cord, axonal beading, defasciculation,
and breaks in the nerve cord. The animals with the variant also showed
locomotor defects. Vester et al. (2013) concluded that the HARS R137Q
variant may be a pathogenic allele that predisposes to the development
of peripheral neuropathy, similar to other ARS mutations (see, e.g.,
GARS, 600287), but noted that a causal link remains unclear.

602352	TITLE *602352 GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE 2; GNRH2
DESCRIPTION Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GNRH1; 152760) is a decapeptide widely
known for its role in regulating reproduction by serving as a signal
from the hypothalamus to pituitary gonadotropes. This function for GNRH1
has been highly conserved during 500 million years of vertebrate
evolution despite the fact that its amino acid sequence varies by 50%.
In addition to the hypothalamic GNRH1 of variable sequence, many
vertebrate species express a second, invariant GNRH form, GNRH-II (or
GNRH2), with the primary structure
gln-his-trp-ser-his-gly-trp-tyr-pro-gly. Antibody staining demonstrates
GNRH2 in the midbrain of all species where its location has been
described (Kasten et al., 1996). Furthermore, nucleic acid probes have
been used to identify GNRH2 expression in the midbrain of several fish
species and one mammal. White et al. (1998) showed that a gene encoding
GNRH2 is expressed in humans and is located on chromosome 20p13,
distinct from the GNRH1 gene on 8p21-p11.2. The genomic and mRNA
structures of GNRH2 parallel those of GNRH1. However, in contrast to
GNRH1, GNRH2 is expressed at significantly higher levels outside the
brain (up to 30-fold), particularly in the kidney, bone marrow, and
prostate. The widespread expression of GNRH2 suggests it may have
multiple functions. Molecular phylogenetic analysis shows that GNRH2 is
likely the result of a duplication before the appearance of vertebrates,
and predicts the existence of a third GNRH form in humans and other
vertebrates. White et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization
to map GNRH2 to 20p13.

Chen et al. (2002) found that human normal and leukemic T cells produce
GNRH2 and GNRH1. Exposure of normal or cancerous human or mouse T cells
to GNRH2 or GNRH1 triggered de novo gene transcription and cell-surface
expression of the laminin receptor (150370), which is involved in
cellular adhesion and migration and in tumor invasion and metastasis.
GNRH2 or GNRH1 also induced adhesion to laminin and chemotaxis toward
SDF1A (600835), and augmented entry in vivo of metastatic T-lymphoma
into the spleen and bone marrow. Homing of normal T cells into specific
organs was reduced in mice lacking GNRH1. A specific GNRH1 receptor
antagonist blocked GNRH1 but not GNRH2-induced effects, which was
suggestive of signaling through distinct receptors. Chen et al. (2002)
suggested that GNRH2 and GNRH1, secreted from nerves or autocrine or
paracrine sources, interact directly with T cells and trigger gene
transcription, adhesion, chemotaxis, and homing to specific organs.

603002	TITLE *603002 TRANSPORTIN 2; TNPO2
;;TRN2;;
KARYOPHERIN BETA-2B; KPNB2B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Transportin-1 (KPNB2; 602901) interacts directly and specifically with
M9, the bidirectional transport signal of the nuclear shuttling protein
hnRNPA1 (164017) and mediates hnRNPA1 nuclear import. In the course of
isolating additional transportin-1 cDNAs, Siomi et al. (1997) isolated
cDNAs encoding a related protein that they designated 'transportin-2.'
The sequence of the predicted 894-amino acid protein shares 84% identity
with that of transportin-1. One notable difference is that transportin-2
contains a short extra sequence within the region corresponding to the
M9-interacting domain of transportin-1. Far Western blotting showed that
transportin-2 and transportin-1 have different substrate specificities.
Siomi et al. (1997) suggested that the insert in transportin-2 modifies
its interaction with import substrates.

GENE FUNCTION

Transport of macromolecules between the cell nucleus and cytoplasm
occurs through the nuclear pores and is mediated by soluble carriers
known as karyopherins, transportins, importins, or exportins. Shamsher
et al. (2002) found that transportin-2 forms complexes with the mRNA
export factor TAP (NXF1; 602647) that strictly depend on the presence of
RanGTP. The data supported the conclusion that transportin-2
participates directly in the export of a large proportion of cellular
mRNAs, and that TAP connects transportin-2 to mRNAs to be exported.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRN2
gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP WI-30101).

305360	TITLE *305360 MEMBRANE PROTEIN, PALMITOYLATED 1; MPP1
;;ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN p55; EMP55;;
PALMITOYLATED ERYTHROCYTE MEMBRANE PROTEIN; PEMP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EMP55 is the prototype of a family of membrane-associated proteins
termed MAGUKs (membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs). MAGUKs
interact with the cytoskeleton and regulate cell proliferation,
signaling pathways, and intracellular junctions (Kim et al., 1996).

CLONING

Ruff et al. (1991) deduced the complete amino acid sequence of a 55-kD
erythrocyte membrane protein from cDNA clones isolated from a human
reticulocyte library. This protein, p55, was copurified during the
isolation of dematin, an actin-bundling protein of the erythrocyte
membrane cytoskeleton. Its tight association with the plasma membrane
was reminiscent of an integral membrane protein. Protein p55 is the most
extensively palmitoylated protein of the erythrocyte membrane. Predicted
primary structure of p55 contained a conserved sequence, called the SH3
(src homology 3) motif, found in several other proteins that associate
with the cytoskeleton and are suspected to play important roles in
signal transduction.

Metzenberg and Gitschier (1992) found a gene located in a CpG island 30
kb 3-prime to the factor VIII gene (F8; 300841). The 2-kb transcript
encoded a previously described palmitoylated membrane protein, p55,
containing an src homology motif, SH3. Although originally described in
reticulocytes (Ruff et al., 1991), Metzenberg and Gitschier (1992) found
that the transcript was expressed in a wide variety of human tissues.
The gene was also found in the mouse where it was expressed in all
tissues examined. The EMP55 gene did not appear to be developmentally
regulated in erythrocytes; p55 is constitutively and abundantly
expressed in erythroid cells during their development from stem cells to
fully differentiated reticulocytes. In contrast, other red cell
membrane-associated proteins such as 4.1, ankyrin, and band 3 are
expressed late in erythropoiesis. These results suggested that the p55
protein may have a housekeeping function. Other work indicated that it
is a peripheral membrane protein. Bryant and Woods (1992) demonstrated
that p55 is homologous to the yeast guanylate kinase and to the product
of a Drosophila tumor suppressor gene.

Elder et al. (1996) cloned and sequenced the mouse MPP1 gene. The mouse
gene shares 89% sequence identity with the coding sequence of human
MPP1. The coding region size and intron/exon structures of the mouse and
human genes are identical. The human and mouse sequences and structures
are highly homologous to the MPP1 gene of fish (Fugu), suggesting that
the gene serves an essential function in development.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a mouse embryo cDNA library, Mburu et al.
(2006) found that whirlin (WHRN; 607928) interacted with p55. p55 was
expressed in mouse outer hair cells in long stereocilia that made up the
stereocilia bundle and in surrounding shorter stereocilia structures.
Since p55 and protein 4.1R (EPB41; 130500) form complexes critical for
actin cytoskeletal assembly in erythrocytes, Mburu et al. (2006)
proposed that p55 and whirlin may have a similar role in hair cell
stereocilia.

GENE STRUCTURE

Metzenberg and Gitschier (1992) estimated that the EMP55 gene spans 20
to 30 kb.

Kim et al. (1996) reported the complete intron/exon map of the human
erythroid p55 gene. The structure of the p55 gene was determined from
cosmid clones isolated from a cosmid library specific for the human X
chromosome. There is a single copy of the p55 gene, composed of 12 exons
and spanning approximately 28 kb in the Xq28 region. Several of the exon
boundaries corresponded to the boundaries of functional domains in the
p55 protein. These domains include an SH3 motif and a region that binds
to cytoskeletal protein 4.1.

MAPPING

Metzenberg and Gitschier (1992) identified the EMP55 gene in a CpG
island 30 kb 3-prime to the factor VIII gene (300841). They confirmed
the Xq28 localization of the EMP55 gene by study of hybrid cell lines
containing various parts of the human X chromosome in rodent
backgrounds. They proved that the gene is located between the F8 and
glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; 305900) genes by hybridization
to a YAC clone that extends approximately 60 kb beyond the F8C gene. The
EMP55 gene appeared to be transcribed in the same direction as F8C. No
known factor VIII gene deletions extended into the EMP55 gene. Since the
function of the p55 protein was not known, the gene was formally a
candidate for any of the many disease genes that are closely linked
genetically to the F8C gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Metzenberg et al. (1994) failed to find evidence of mutation in the
EMP55 gene in either of 2 disorders that on the grounds of phenotype and
map location are candidate disorders: dyskeratosis congenita (305000)
and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300).

Liu et al. (1997) reported a method of determination of clonality using
allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) to detect exonic polymorphisms in p55 and
G6PD (305900). They demonstrated a significant sex difference in allele
frequencies in African Americans but not in Caucasians, and linkage
disequilibrium for the p55 and G6PD alleles in Caucasians but not in
African Americans.

605213	TITLE *605213 3-@PHOSPHOINOSITIDE-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 1; PDPK1
;;PDK1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Isoforms of protein kinase B (PKB, or AKT1; 164730) are overexpressed in
some ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancer cells, and PKB has been
shown to protect cells from apoptosis. Activation of PKB, which is
preventable by inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (see PIK3CG;
601232), is stimulated by insulin or growth factors after
phosphorylation of PKB at thr308 and ser473. Alessi et al. (1997)
biochemically purified a protein kinase, which they called PDK1, that
phosphorylates PKB at thr308 in response to phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) or phosphatidylinositol
3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and enhances PKB activity. By
microsequence analysis of the approximately 67- to 69-kD PDK1 protein,
searching an EST database, and probing a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Alessi et al. (1997) isolated a cDNA encoding PDK1, also called
PDPK1. Sequence analysis predicted that the 556-amino acid PDPK1 protein
contains a catalytic domain with 11 classic kinase subdomains and a
C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Alessi et al. (1997) found that expression of recombinant PDPK1 resulted
in the activation and phosphorylation of PKB at thr308 in a
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3- or PtdIns(3,4)P2-dependent manner via the PH domains.

Stephens et al. (1998) demonstrated that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and
PtdIns(3,4)P2 bind to the PH domains of PKB and PDPK1, causing their
translocation to the membrane and leading to PKB activation.

Pullen et al. (1998) showed that PDPK1 selectively phosphorylates the
70-kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70-RPS6K) at thr229, which is
required for its activation. Thr229 of p70-RPS6K is homologous to thr308
of the PKB protein.

Using transfected HEK293 cells stimulated with pervanadate or insulin,
Park et al. (2001) found that PDK1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and
translocates to the plasma membrane. Following pervanadate treatment,
PDK1 kinase activity increased 1.5- to 3-fold, whereas the activity of
PDK1 associated with the plasma membrane increased approximately 6-fold.
The activity localized to the plasma membrane was also increased by
insulin treatment. Using site-directed mutants, they determined that
phosphorylation of tyr373/tyr376 is important for PDK1 activity.

Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011) after
engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) is important for T cell
proliferation and activation during the adaptive immune response. Lee et
al. (2005) demonstrated that PDK1 has an essential role in this pathway
by regulating the activation of PKC-theta (PRKCQ; 600448) and through
signal-dependent recruiting of both PKC-theta and CARD11 (607210) to
lipid rafts. PDK1-associated PKC-theta recruits the IKK complex, whereas
PDK1-associated CARD11 recruits the Bcl10-MALT1 complex (see 604860),
thereby allowing activation of the IKK complex through
Bcl10-MALT1-dependent ubiquitination of the IKK complex subunit NEMO
(300248). Lee et al. (2005) concluded that PDK1 plays a critical role by
nucleating the TCR-induced NF-kappa-B activation pathway in T cells.

Gruber et al. (2006) commented on the study of Lee et al. (2005),
stating they observed that PKC-theta is phosphorylated on the activation
loop at thr538 before T cell activation. The results of Gruber et al.
(2006) are therefore inconsistent with the conclusions of Lee et al.
(2005) that thr538 phosphorylation of PKC-theta is regulated by T-cell
receptor activation. They postulated that other mechanisms, such as
autophosphorylation of thr219, might orchestrate the cellular function
of PKC-theta in T cells. Lee et al. (2006) responded to the comments of
Gruber et al. (2006) to state that several other groups have replicated
their data regarding inducible phosphorylation of thr538 in T cells. Lee
et al. (2006) noted that although the physiologic relevance of the
discrepancy is unclear, substantial differences and experimental
conditions and reagents may have accounted for the conflicting
observations.

In 3-dimensional matrices, cancer cells move with a rounded, amoeboid
morphology that is controlled by ROCK1-dependent contraction of
actomyosin. Using human cancer cell lines, Pinner and Sahai (2008)
showed that PDK1 was required for phosphorylation of myosin light chain
(see 160780) and cell motility, both on deformable gels and in vivo.
Depletion of PDK1 via RNA interference altered the localization of ROCK1
and reduced its ability to drive cortical actomyosin contraction. This
form of ROCK1 regulation did not require PDK1 kinase activity. Instead,
PDK1 competed directly with RHOE (RND3; 602924) for binding to ROCK1 and
opposed inhibition of ROCK1 by RHOE.

MAPPING

Alessi et al. (1997) and Stephens et al. (1998) mapped the PDPK1 gene to
16p13.3 based on its identity to a sequence located in the same region
as the PKD1 (601313) and TSC2 (191092) loci (Burn et al., 1996).

ANIMAL MODEL

Lawlor et al. (2002) found that Pdk1-null mice died at embryonic day 9.5
with multiple abnormalities, including lack of somites, forebrain, and
neural crest-derived tissues. Development of hind- and midbrain,
however, proceeded relatively normally. Lawlor et al. (2002) developed a
mouse strain that showed reduced levels of Pdk1 activity. These
hypomorphic Pdk1 mice were viable and fertile, and insulin injection
induced the normal phosphorylation responses attributed to Pdk1
activation. Nevertheless, these mice were 40 to 50% smaller than control
animals. The organ volumes from the Pdk1 hypomorphic mice were reduced
proportionally, and the volume of a number of Pdk1-deficient cells was
reduced by 35 to 60%. Pdk1 deficiency seemed to regulate cell size
directly and independently of cell number or proliferation rate.

The PDK1 'master kinase' mediates activation of AGC serine kinases (PKA,
PKG, and PKC (see 176960)) by phosphorylating them at the 'T-loop' site
of their catalytic domains. In order to determine the role of AGC serine
kinases in T-cell development, Hinton et al. (2004) used conditional
gene deletion of Pdk1 in mouse T cells to avoid embryonic lethality.
Complete loss of Pdk1 blocked T-cell differentiation in thymus, whereas
reducing Pdk1 activity to 10% of normal allowed differentiation to
proceed but blocked thymic expansion.

Hashimoto et al. (2006) investigated the role of PDK1, a
serine-threonine kinase, in regulating islet mass via a signaling
pathway that includes INSR (147670) or IGF1R (147370), IRS1 (147545),
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Hashimoto et al. (2006) showed
that mice lacking Pdk1 specifically in pancreatic beta cells developed
progressive hyperglycemia as a result of loss of islet mass. The mice
showed reductions in islet density as well as in number and size of beta
cells. Haploinsufficiency of the Foxo1 gene (136533) resulted in a
marked increase in the number, but not the size, of beta cells and
resulted in restoration of glucose homeostasis in beta cell-specific
Pdk1-null mice. Hashimoto et al. (2006) suggested that PDK1 is important
in maintenance of pancreatic beta cell mass and glucose homeostasis.

In mice lacking Pdk1 in oocytes, Reddy et al. (2009) demonstrated that
the majority of primordial follicles were depleted around the onset of
sexual maturity, causing premature ovarian failure (POF) during early
adulthood. Suppressed PDK1-Akt1 (164730)-S6K1 (RPS6KB1; 608938)-RPS6
(180460) signaling in oocytes appeared to be responsible for the loss of
primordial follicles, and mice lacking the Rps6 gene in oocytes showed
POF similar to that in Pdk1-deficient mice. Reddy et al. (2009)
concluded that the PI3K/PTEN (601728)-PDK1 signaling pathway in oocytes
controls the survival, loss, and activation of primordial follicles
(which together determine reproductive aging and the length of
reproductive life in females), and that underactivation or
overactivation of the pathway in oocytes may cause POF and infertility.

611982	TITLE *611982 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S18B; MRPS18B
;;MRPS18-2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPS18B
is a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human MRPS18B, which they called MRPS18-2. The deduced
MRPS18B protein contains 258 amino acids and has a calculated molecular
mass of 29.3 kD. Removal of a predicted 25-amino acid N-terminal
mitochondrial localization signal results in a mature 26.5-kD protein.
Koc et al. (2001) noted that 1 Mrps18 protein is present in E. coli,
whereas other organisms contain several Mrps18 orthologs. Humans have 3
MRPS18 proteins, MRPS18A (611981), MRPS18B, and MRPS18C (611983), that
share sequence conservation only in their central regions. Mouse and
human MRPS18B share 78.4% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang and Gerstein (2003) mapped the
MRPS18B gene to chromosome 6p21.3. They identified MRPS18B pseudogenes
on chromosomes 1 and 2.

613110	TITLE *613110 BLADDER CANCER-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; BLCAP
;;BLADDER CANCER-ASSOCIATED, 10-KD; BC10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The BLCAP gene is a tumor suppressor that limits cell proliferation and
stimulates apoptosis. BLCAP protein or message is downregulated or
absent in a variety of human cancers (Schulz et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using differential display to identify genes upregulated in tumor
biopsies obtained from a noninvasive compared with invasive bladder
transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs), Gromova et al. (1999) identified
BLCAP, which they designated BC10. Gromova et al. (2002) cloned
full-length BC10 from a cDNA library developed from a noninvasive TCC.
The deduced 87-amino acid peptide has a calculated molecular mass of 9.8
kD. It has an N-terminal cytoplasmic region, followed by a proline-rich
region with characteristics of the SRC (190090) homology-3
domain-binding site, 2 highly hydrophobic regions, and a C terminus with
a putative casein kinase II (see CSNK2A1, 115440) phosphorylation site.
Human and mouse BC10 share 100% amino acid identity, and the
corresponding transcripts share 95% nucleotide identity in the coding
region. Close orthologs were also detected in nematode and fly,
suggesting a high degree of conservation. Northern blot analysis
detected a transcript of about 2 kb in noninvasive TCC. Two-dimensional
separation of proteins in BC10-expressing COS cells, followed by Western
blot analysis, revealed a major acidic form of BC10, and a minor basic
form of BC10, both at an apparent molecular mass of 10 kD. The acidic
form is likely phosphorylated.

Schulz et al. (2009) identified at least 4 distinct human BLCAP
transcripts and 2 distinct mouse transcripts. They referred to BLCAP
transcripts with translation start sites downstream of NNAT (603106),
which is within intron 1 of BLCAP, as BLCAP-V1A, -V1B, and -V1C, and
they referred to the BLCAP transcript with translation start site
upstream of NNAT as BLCAP-V2A.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR, Gromova et al. (2002) confirmed
that the expression of BLCAP was downregulated in invasive bladder TCCs.

Yao et al. (2007) stated that expression of BLCAP is downregulated in
several types of carcinomas and overexpression of BLCAP in HeLa cells
induces apoptosis. They found that BLCAP overexpression in a human
tongue carcinoma cell line induced S phase arrest and apoptosis,
accompanied by upregulation of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899) and downregulation
of BCL2 (151430) and BCLXL (BCL2L1; 600039).

GENE STRUCTURE

Schulz et al. (2009) noted that the BLCAP gene consists of 2 exons
traversing approximately 13 kb, with evidence for 2 alternative exons
resulting in minor splice variants. In mouse and human, the first intron
of the BLCAP gene contains the distinct neuronatin (NNAT; 603106) gene,
which is an imprinted gene exclusively expressed from the paternally
inherited allele.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gromova et al. (2002) mapped the BLCAP
gene to chromosome 20q11.2-q12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schulz et al. (2009) found that mouse Blcap-v1 transcripts were
preferentially expressed from maternally-inherited alleles in adult and
fetal brain but not in other murine tissues, and likewise human BLCAP-V1
transcripts showed similar preferential expression from
maternally-inherited alleles in adult and fetal brain. Mouse and human
BLCAP-V2A transcripts were found predominantly expressed from
paternally-inherited alleles in brain. They proposed that the
tissue-specific imprinting of BLCAP may be due to the particularly high
transcriptional activity of NNAT in brain. Schulz et al. (2009)
hypothesized that the imprinted expression of BLCAP and its interplay
with NNAT at the transcriptional level may be relevant to human
carcinogenesis.

603486	TITLE *603486 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 4; USP4
;;UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE; UNP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs) are a group of deubiquitinating
enzymes that possess 2 signature motifs, the Cys box and the His box
(summary by Frederick et al., 1998).

CLONING

Gupta et al. (1993) isolated mouse cDNAs encoding Unp, a protein similar
to the human TRE oncogene. Using Western blots, Gupta et al. (1994)
found that Unp has an apparent molecular mass of 180 kD. They reported
that overexpression of Unp led to oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3
cells injected into athymic mice.

By screening a human frontal cortex library with a murine Unp cDNA, Gray
et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding human UNP. Analysis of the clones
revealed a large open reading with the potential to encode a protein of
854 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 97 kD. The human and mouse
proteins share 90% sequence identity. Northern blot analysis of primary
lung tumor samples indicated that levels of UNP mRNA were elevated in
small cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas relative to normal adult lung.

Frederick et al. (1998) sequenced additional UNP cDNAs and found several
differences from the sequence reported by Gray et al. (1995), including
2 single nucleotide insertions that increased the length of the
predicted protein, UNPEL (UNP extended, long isoform), to 963 amino
acids. They also recovered cDNAs encoding a shorter isoform designated
UNPES. Both isoforms exhibited deubiquitinating activity. Antibodies
against UNP detected 2 proteins of 105 to 110 kD on Western blots. Using
immunocytochemistry of mammalian cells expressing epitope-tagged UNP and
cell fractionation studies, Frederick et al. (1998) demonstrated that
both isoforms of the human protein are localized primarily in the
cytosol. (In an erratum, Frederick et al. (1998) cited a personal
communication from the Gray laboratory stating that the data in Gupta et
al. (1993) locating Unp in the nuclear fraction of mammalian cell
extracts was apparently in error.) Northern blot analysis revealed UNP
expression as a closely-migrating cluster of mRNAs in all tissues
tested. However, the authors found no evidence for overexpression of UNP
transcripts in cell lines derived from small cell lung carcinomas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Di Fruscio et al. (1998) reported that the mouse Unp gene contains 22
exons distributed over 47 kb. A processed ribosomal S2 pseudogene was
identified in the third intron.

MAPPING

By analysis of an interspecific backcross, Gupta et al. (1993) mapped
the Unp gene to mouse chromosome 9 in a region showing homology of
synteny with human chromosome 3p.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Gray et al. (1995) mapped the
human UNP gene to 3p21.3, a region implicated in neoplasms of the lung.
Using the same technique, Frederick et al. (1998) refined the map
position to 3p21.31.

;;FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, 36-KD
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS; 194050) is a developmental disorder
caused by haploinsufficiency of genes in 7q11.23. The deleted DNA
associated with WBS spans more than 1 Mb. Using an STS that maps close
to the common WBS centromeric deletion breakpoint, Meng et al. (1998)
isolated human testis cDNAs corresponding to a novel gene, FKBP6,
located within the WBS deletion region. The FKBP6 gene has 9 exons and
is oriented in a 5-prime to 3-prime direction from centromere to
telomere. FKBP6 is completely contained within a 35-kb cosmid; the DNA
corresponding to the insert of this cosmid was deleted in 40 of 40 WBS
individuals. The predicted 327-amino acid FKBP6 protein shows structural
homology to FKBP immunophilins, which are cellular receptors for the
immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and rapamycin. FKBP6 contains an
N-terminal FK506-binding peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (rotamase) domain and
3 imperfect C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. Northern
blot analysis detected an approximately 1.6-kb FKBP6 transcript in all
human tissues examined, with exceptionally high expression in testis and
high expression in heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney.

Metcalfe et al. (2005) described a Bulgarian father and son with
Williams-Beuren syndrome who appeared to have a common heterozygous
deletion, confirming the expected dominant transmission and adding to
the few familial cases reported. The deletion included the FKBP6 gene
which has been shown to play a role in homologous chromosome pairing in
meiosis and male fertility in mouse models. Metcalfe et al. (2005)
suggested that haploinsufficiency for FKBP6 does not appear to preclude
male fertility in WBS, although male infertility involving this gene has
the potential to follow the mouse model as a human autosomal recessive
condition.

ANIMAL MODEL

Crackower et al. (2003) showed that Fkbp6 localizes to meiotic
chromosome cores and regions of homologous chromosome synapsis. Targeted
inactivation of Fkbp6 in mice resulted in aspermic males and the absence
of normal pachytene spermatocytes. Moreover, Crackower et al. (2003)
identified the deletion of Fkbp6 exon 8 as the causative mutation in
spontaneously sterile male 'aspermia' (as/as) mutant rats. Loss of Fkbp6
results in abnormal pairing and misalignments between homologous
chromosomes, nonhomologous partner switches, and autosynapsis of X
chromosome cores in meiotic spermatocytes. Fertility and meiosis are
normal in Fkbp6 mutant females. Thus, Crackower et al. (2003) concluded
that Fkbp6 is a component of the synaptonemal complex essential for
sex-specific fertility and for the fidelity of homologous chromosome
pairing in meiosis.

607389	TITLE *607389 SINGLE-STRANDED DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 2; SSBP2
;;SENSOR OF SINGLE-STRANDED DNA COMPLEX, SUBUNIT B2; SOSSB2;;
SOSS COMPLEX, SUBUNIT B2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SSBP2 is a subunit of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding complex
involved in the maintenance of genome stability (Huang et al., 2009).

CLONING

By positional cloning, Castro et al. (2002) identified a novel gene,
which they designated SSBP2, that is disrupted at the 5q13 breakpoint in
the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line ML3. EST database searching
revealed that the transcript is similar to the chicken gene CSDP, which
encodes a protein that binds single-stranded pyrimidine-rich
mirror-repeat elements with high specificity. By further database
searching, they identified 2 additional cDNAs encoding single-stranded
DNA-binding proteins, SSBP3 (607390) and SSBP4 (607391). The deduced
362-amino acid SSBP2 protein shares 83% and 73% sequence identity with
SSBP3 and SSBP4, respectively, and 100% identity with the mouse Ssbp2
homolog. SSBP family members share a highly conserved N terminus
followed by a glycine- and proline-rich domain. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of a 1.9-kb SSBP2 transcript. Expression
was high in all hematopoietic tissues, including spleen, lymph node,
peripheral blood, bone marrow, thymus, and fetal liver, with highest
expression in thymus and fetal liver. Expression was also high in heart,
brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Of 5 leukemia cell lines tested,
expression was highest in pre-T lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CEM. No
gross inactivating mutations were found in leukemia cell lines or in
primary leukemic blasts from 4 patients.

GENE FUNCTION

Using HEK293 cells for tandem affinity purification, Huang et al. (2009)
identified SOSSA (INTS3; 611347) and SOSSC (613273) as common components
of 2 distinct and complementary ssDNA-binding heterotrimeric complexes
defined by their inclusion of either SOSSB1 (SSBP1; 600439) or SOSSB2
(SSBP2), but not both. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that
SOSS complexes formed in HeLa cells independent of DNA damage.
Recombinant heterotrimeric SOSS complexes specifically bound ssDNA, but
not double-stranded DNA. SOSSA served as the central assembly factor,
and SOSSB and SOSSC bound overlapping regions on SOSSA, but they did not
interact directly with each other. Depletion of SOSSA by small
interfering RNA led to dramatic decreases in SOSSB1 and SOSSB2 protein
levels, abrogated targeting of SOSSB1 and SOSSB2 to chromatin, increased
ionizing radiation sensitivity, caused defective G2/M checkpoint, and
impaired homologous recombination repair. Huang et al. (2009)
demonstrated that both SOSS complexes and the CTIP (RBBP8; 604124)/RPA
(see RPA1; 179835) complex acted downstream of the MRE11 (600814)-RAD50
(604040)-NBS1 (NBN; 602667) complex and functioned in DNA damage repair.

GENE STRUCTURE

Castro et al. (2002) determined that the SSBP2, SSBP3, and SSBP4 genes
all contain 17 exons and have identical intron/exon boundaries,
suggesting duplication from a common ancestral gene. They also
identified alternative splicing and additional internal exons for all 3
genes, suggesting the existence of multiple isoforms for each protein.
The SSBP2 gene spans more than 200 kb.

MAPPING

Castro et al. (2002) mapped the SSBP2 gene to chromosome 5q13.3, within
the critical breakpoint region in the AML cell line ML3.

KIAA0775
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TBKBP1 is an adaptor protein that binds to TBK1 (604834) and is part of
the interaction network in the TNF (191160)/NFKB (see 164011) pathway
(Bouwmeester et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching for sequences with the potential to encode large proteins
expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding
KIAA0775. The predicted protein contains 615 amino acids. RT-PCR
analysis detected ubiquitous expression, with highest levels in ovary,
followed by testis, brain, heart, lung, smooth muscle, kidney, and
liver.

;;ZINC FINGER PROTEIN, SUBFAMILY 1A, MEMBER 1; ZNFN1A1;;
IKAROS; IK1;;
LYF1
IKAROS/BCL6 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ikaros proteins are lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription
factors that are considered master regulators of lymphocyte
differentiation. Klug et al. (1998) noted that there are at least 8
alternatively spliced transcripts of the Ikaros gene that encode
isoforms with common N-terminal and C-terminal domains. By screening a
Jurkat T-cell cDNA library with a mouse Ikaros cDNA, Molnar et al.
(1996) isolated human Ikaros cDNAs. The deduced human and mouse Ikaros
proteins are 95% identical. RT-PCR of human thymus and peripheral blood
leukocyte mRNAs detected 6 Ikaros splicing variants which were expressed
at similar levels and ratios as the corresponding mouse leukocyte Ikaros
transcripts. The authors found that Ikaros proteins are conserved in
sequence composition and relative expression between human T cells and
mouse thymocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of
7.5- and 4.5-kb Ikaros transcripts in human thymus, spleen, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

By PCR using primers based on a conserved nucleotide sequence of various
zinc finger proteins, Nietfeld and Meyerhans (1996) cloned human bone
marrow cDNAs encoding Ikaros, which they designated IK1. The deduced
519-amino acid protein is 93% identical to the mouse Ikaros isoform
1/LyF1 isoform VI and contains 4 N-terminal and 2 C-terminal zinc finger
domains. The authors detected 3 human mRNA species by Northern blot
analysis: a 4.4-kb transcript, which was prominent in peripheral blood
leukocytes; a 6.0-kb transcript, which was strongly expressed in spleen,
thymus, lymph node, and bone marrow; and a 7.0-kb transcript. They
stated that the human and mouse Ikaros genes have similar overall
transcription patterns.

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the N-terminal Kruppel-like zinc finger
domain of Ikaros proteins is involved in DNA binding, while the
C-terminal zinc finger domain mediates homo- or heterodimerization with
other Ikaros proteins. Alternative splicing of exons 3 to 6 produces
Ikaros isoforms with 0 to 4 N-terminal zinc fingers, and those with at
least 3 efficiently bind DNA. The DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms include
IK1, IK2, IK3, and IKX, and IK4 can bind DNA on palindromic sequences.
IK5, IK6, IK7, and IK8 are considered dominant-negative isoforms due to
their capacity to bind other isoforms and their inefficiency in binding
DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Harker et al. (2002) showed that Ikaros may play an important role in
CD4 (186940) versus CD8 (see CD8A; 186910) lineage commitment decisions
by demonstrating: (1) that it binds to regulatory elements in the
endogenous CD8A locus in vivo using thymocyte chromatin
immunoprecipitations; (2) that Ikaros suppresses position effect
variegation of transgenes driven by CD8 regulatory elements; and (3)
that mice with reduced levels of Ikaros and Aiolos (606221) show an
apparent increase in CD4 populations with immature phenotype, i.e.,
cells that fail to activate the CD8A gene. The authors proposed that
Ikaros family members function as activators of the CD8A gene and that
their associated activities are critical for appropriate chromatin
remodeling transitions during thymocyte differentiation and lineage
commitment.

Ezzat et al. (2005) demonstrated that Ikaros is expressed in the
hormone-producing pituitary corticomelanotroph cells of mice, where it
binds the proopiomelanocortin promoter and regulates endogenous gene
expression. Ikaros-null mice had contraction of the pituitary
corticomelanotroph population, reduced circulating adrenocorticotrophic
hormone levels, and adrenal glucocorticoid insufficiency. Hematopoietic
reconstitution failed to correct this hormonal deficit, but the
phenotype of reduced body weight and diminished survival was rescued by
systemic glucocorticoid-hormone administration. Ezzat et al. (2005)
concluded that Ikaros plays a role in orchestrating immune-endocrine
development and function.

Yap et al. (2005) identified Ikaros-binding elements in the 5-prime
flanking regions of pufferfish, mouse, and human STAT4 (600558).
Transactivation, electrophoretic mobility shift, and RNA interference
analyses showed that Ikaros bound to the STAT4 promoter and was involved
in regulation of STAT4 in human T cells.

Dijon et al. (2008) found that purified CD34 (142230)-positive human
cord blood cells and adult peripheral blood cells that were cultured
under erythroid conditions expressed the DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms IK1
through IK4, but not the dominant-negative isoform IK6.
Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that expression of IK6 in these
cells resulted in complex formation between IK6 and IK1, and IK6
decreased cell number and increased cell death. IK6 overexpression
disturbed erythroid differentiation and expression of erythroid-specific
genes, although it had no effect on Ikaros expression, and favored
myelopoiesis by promoting expression of myeloid-specific genes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dijon et al. (2008) stated that the IKZF1 gene contains 7 translated
exons.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid DNAs, Molnar et al. (1996) mapped the human
Ikaros gene to 7p13-p11.1, near the EGFR gene (131550). They mapped the
mouse Ikaros gene to chromosome 11 by interspecific backcross analysis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Ikaros is required for normal lymphocyte development. Germline mutant
mice that express only non-DNA-binding dominant-negative 'leukemogenic'
Ikaros isoforms lacking critical N-terminal zinc fingers develop an
aggressive form of lymphoblastic leukemia 3 to 6 months after birth (see
'Animal Model' below). These facts prompted Sun et al. (1999) to seek
molecular abnormalities involving the Ikaros gene in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL2; 613067) in infants. In leukemic cells from 12 ALL
infants less than 1 year of age, Sun et al. (1999) found high-level
expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ikaros with abnormal
subcellular compartmentalization patterns. PCR cloning and nucleotide
sequencing were used to identify the specific Ikaros isoforms and detect
Ikaros gene mutations in these cells. Leukemic cells from 7 of 7 infants
with ALL, including 5 of 5 MLL-AF4-positive (159557) infants, expressed
dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms IK4, IK7, and IK8 that lack critical
N-terminal zinc fingers. In 6 of 7 patients, Sun et al. (1999) detected
an in-frame deletion of 10 amino acids (KSSMPQKFLG) upstream of the
transcription-activation domain adjacent to the C-terminal zinc fingers
of IK2, IK4, IK7, and IK8. In contrast, only wildtype IK1 and IK2
isoforms with normal nuclear localization were found in normal infant
bone marrow cells and infant thymocytes. These results implicated the
expression of dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms and the disruption of
normal Ikaros function in the leukemogenesis of ALL in infants.

Nakase et al. (2000) found overexpression of the dominant-negative IK6
isoform in 14 of 41 B-cell patients with adult B-cell ALL. None of the
other dominant-negative isoforms of the Ikaros gene were detected by
RT-PCR analysis. Southern blot analysis with PstI digestion revealed
that those patients with the dominant-negative IK6 isoform might have
small mutations in the Ikaros locus. The results suggested that Ikaros
plays a key role in human B-cell malignancies through the
dominant-negative isoform IK6.

Using RT-PCR to detect Ikaros isoforms with the 30-base deletion in exon
6, Payne et al. (2001) showed that transcripts for IK1 and IK1 with the
deletion were present in normal cord blood and bone marrow, as well as
in 3 ALL cell lines. In addition, they identified an isoform, IKX, that
was identical to IK3 except that it included exon 6; IKX was generated
from a novel exon combination with and without the 30-base deletion.
Payne et al. (2001) detected multiple DNA-binding and nonbinding
isoforms with a 60-base insertion linked to leukemia expressed at the
RNA level in normal hemopoietic cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated
that the predominant isoform in normal cells is IKX, while the
predominant form in leukemic cells is IK1.

In a genomewide analysis of leukemic cells from 242 pediatric ALL
patients using high resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, Mullighan et al. (2007) identified
mutations in genes encoding principal regulators of B-lymphocyte
development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases.
Deletions were detected in IKZF1, IKZF3 (606221),TCF3 (147141), EBF1
(164343), and LEF1 (153245). The PAX5 (167414) gene was the most
frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases.

The Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality that encodes
BCR-ABL1 (see 151410, 189980), is the defining lesion of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). To define oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to
induce ALL, Mullighan et al. (2008) performed a genomewide analysis of
diagnostic leukemia samples from 304 individuals with ALL, including 43
BCR-ABL1 B-progenitor ALLs and 23 CML cases. IKZF1, encoding the
transcription factor Ikaros, was deleted in 83.7% of BCR-ABL1 ALL, but
not in chronic phase CML. Deletion of IKZF1 was also identified as an
acquired lesion at the time of transformation of CML to ALL (lymphoid
blast crisis). The IKZF1 deletions resulted in haploinsufficiency,
expression of a dominant-negative Ikaros isoform, or the complete loss
of Ikaros expression. Sequencing of IKZF1 deletion breakpoints suggested
that aberrant RAG-mediated recombination (see 179615) is responsible for
the deletions. Mullighan et al. (2008) concluded that genetic lesions
resulting in the loss of Ikaros function are an important event in the
development of BCR-ABL1 ALL.

Mullighan et al. (2009) identified deletions involving the IKZF1 gene in
leukemic cells of 63 (28.6%) of 221 children with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. Cells from 20 patients had a deletion of coding
exons 3 through 6, resulting in the expression of a dominant-negative
form of IKZF1. IKZF1 deletions were associated with an increased risk of
relapse and adverse effects in the original cohort and in an independent
cohort of 258 patients (p values ranging from less than 0.001 to 0.004).

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
IKZF1 gene and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, see ALL2 (613067).

CYTOGENETICS

The BCL6 gene (109565), isolated from the breakpoints of 3q27-associated
chromosomal translocations, is implicated in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBL). Hosokawa et al. (2000) described the molecular
characterization of novel t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations in 2 patients
with DLBL. Molecular genetic analysis of the breakpoint area involving
BCL6 revealed the presence of the Ikaros gene. As a molecular
consequence of the translocation, the 5-prime regulatory region of BCL6
was replaced by the putative 5-prime regulatory region of the Ikaros
gene, probably leading to deregulated expression of the BCL6 gene
throughout B-cell differentiation. RT-PCR and FISH analyses of a patient
sample established that the translocation resulted in fusion of the
Ikaros and BCL6 genes. The clinical features of the 2 patients with DLBL
and t(3;7)(q27;p12) translocations were reported by Ichinohasama et al.
(1998).

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice homozygous for a germline mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain
lack not only T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, but also
their earliest defined progenitors (Georgopoulos et al., 1994). In
contrast, the erythroid and myeloid lineages are intact in these mutant
mice. Klug et al. (1998) showed that the DNA-binding isoforms of mouse
Ikaros are localized in the nucleus of the most primitive hematopoietic
stem cell subset. They found that Ikaros localizes to heterochromatin in
Abelson-transformed pre-B lymphocytes. Changes in the RNA splicing
pattern of Ikaros occurred at 2 stages of lymphoid differentiation.

O'Neill et al. (1999, 2000) described the structure of a chromatin
remodeling complex associated with Ikaros that is present only in adult
hematopoietic cells. This complex binds to Ikaros-like DNA-binding
sites, including a long polypyrimidine-rich sequence upstream of the
human delta-globin gene (142000), and was thus called PYR complex.
Deletion of this sequence in a human beta locus-containing cosmid
(carrying sequences from the human gamma-A gene, 142200, through the
adult beta-globin gene, 141900) in transgenic mice resulted in delayed
switching from gamma-globin to beta-globin. Lopez et al. (2002) showed
that homozygous Ikaros-null mice lacked the PYR complex, demonstrating a
requirement for Ikaros in the formation of the complex on DNA.
Heterozygous Ikaros-null mice had about half as much PYR complex,
indicating a dosage effect for both Ikaros and PYR complex. They also
showed that Ikaros-null mice had multiple hematopoietic cell defects,
including anemia and megakaryocytic abnormalities, in addition to
lymphoid and stem cell defects. The null mice also had a delay in murine
embryonic-to-adult beta-globin switching and a delay in human
gamma-to-beta switching, consistent with the suggested role for PYR
complex in this process. Lastly, cDNA array analyses indicated that
several hematopoietic cell-specific genes in all blood lineages were
either up- or downregulated in 14-day embryos from Ikaros-null mice
compared with wildtype mice. These results indicated that Ikaros and PYR
complex function together in vivo at many adult hematopoietic
cell-specific genes and at intergenic sites, affecting their expression
and leading to pleiotropic hematopoietic defects.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are specialized dendritic cells that
produce high levels of type I interferon (see IFNA1; 147660) upon viral
infection. Allman et al. (2006) showed that mice expressing low levels
of Ikaros lacked peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells but not other
dendritic cell subsets. Loss of plasmacytoid dendritic cells was
associated with inability to produce type I interferon after challenge
with Tlr7 (300365) or Tlr9 (605474) ligands or murine cytomegalovirus.
Conventional dendritic cells were present in normal numbers and
exhibited normal responses to in vivo challenge with murine
cytomegalovirus or inactivated toxoplasma antigen.

605565	TITLE *605565 RESISTIN; RETN
;;RSTN;;
FOUND IN INFLAMMATORY ZONE 3; FIZZ3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching sequence databases for genes similar to mouse Fizz1,
Holcomb et al. (2000) identified cDNAs encoding human FIZZ2 (RETNLB;
605645), which the authors incorrectly called FIZZ1, and human and mouse
FIZZ3 (RETN). The deduced 108-amino acid FIZZ3 protein, 53% identical to
mouse Fizz3 and 47% identical to human FIZZ2, shares an N-terminal
signal peptide and a C-terminal stretch of 10 cysteine residues with
identical spacing with the other FIZZ family members. In situ
hybridization analysis detected diffuse expression of mouse Fizz3 in
white but not brown adipose tissue in a variety of organs.

GENE FUNCTION

Type II diabetes (125853), characterized by target-tissue resistance to
insulin (176730), is epidemic in industrialized societies and is
strongly associated with obesity. Steppan et al. (2001) studied the
mechanism by which increased adiposity causes insulin resistance. They
demonstrated that adipocytes secrete a unique signaling molecule, which
they called resistin (for resistance to insulin), that may be the
hormone potentially linking obesity to diabetes. Steppan et al. (2001)
identified resistin, which is identical to FIZZ3, by screening for genes
that are induced during adipocyte differentiation but downregulated in
mature adipocytes exposed to thiazolidinediones (TZD),
insulin-secreting, antidiabetic drugs that interact with the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG; 601487). Resistin gene
expression is induced during adipocyte differentiation, and the resistin
polypeptide is specifically expressed and secreted by adipocytes.
Resistin circulates in mouse serum, and its level is increased markedly
in both genetic and diet-induced obesity. Immunoneutralization improves
blood glucose and insulin action in this model of type II diabetes. By
contrast, administration of resistin impairs glucose tolerance and
insulin action in normal mice. In mouse, a single mRNA of roughly 750
residues is robustly expressed in white adipose tissue but not in
several other mouse tissues. Resistin expression is greater in white
adipose tissue than in brown adipose tissue, where resistin mRNA is
barely detectable. Resistin mRNA levels varied as a function of white
adipose depot and gender, with the highest level of expression in female
gonadal fat. Immunohistochemistry of epididymal white adipose tissue
showed that the resistin protein is abundant in adipocyte cytoplasm.
Steppan et al. (2001) found that a unique pattern of C-terminal
cysteines (X11-C-X8-C-X-C-X3-C-X10-C-X-C-X-C-X9-CC-X3-6-END) is
conserved in a family of resistin-like molecules, including at least 3
distinct mouse subtypes.

McTernan et al. (2002) found that resistin mRNA expression was similar
in both subcutaneous abdominal and omental fat depots. However, the
abdominal depots showed a 418% increase in resistin mRNA expression
compared with the thigh. The authors suggested that increased resistin
expression in abdominal fat could explain the increased risk of type II
diabetes associated with central obesity.

Degawa-Yamauchi et al. (2003) investigated the role of resistin in
obesity and insulin resistance by quantitating resistin protein by ELISA
in serum of 27 lean and 50 obese subjects. There was more serum resistin
protein in obese than lean subjects. The elevation of serum resistin in
obese humans was confirmed by Western blot as was expression of resistin
protein in human adipose tissue and isolated adipocytes. There was a
significant positive correlation between resistin and body mass index
(BMI). Multiple regression analysis with predictors BMI and resistin
explained 25% of the variance in the homeostasis model assessment of
insulin resistance score. BMI was a significant predictor of insulin
resistance (P = 0.0002), but resistin adjusted for BMI was not (P =
0.11). The authors concluded that their data demonstrate that resistin
protein is present in human adipose tissue and blood, and that there is
significantly more serum resistin in obese subjects, but it is not a
significant predictor of insulin resistance when adjusted for adiposity.

Verma et al. (2003) incubated endothelial cells with human recombinant
resistin and observed an increase in ET1 (EDN1; 131240) release and ET1
mRNA expression, with no change in nitric oxide production. Treatment
with resistin increased ET1 promoter activity via the activator
protein-1 (AP1; see 165160) site. Resistin upregulated adhesion
molecules and chemokines and downregulated tumor necrosis factor
receptor-associated factor-3 (TRAF3; 601896), an inhibitor of CD40
ligand (CD40LG; 300386) signaling. Verma et al. (2003) concluded that
these effects may represent the mechanistic link between resistin and
cardiovascular disease in the metabolic syndrome (see 605552).

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2002) determined that the resistin gene comprises 4 exons,
the first of which is untranslated, and spans approximately 1,750 bp.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Patel et al. (2004) determined the crystal structure of resistin and
RELM-beta (605645), which revealed an unusual multimeric structure. Each
protomer comprises a carboxy-terminal disulfide-rich beta-sandwich
'head' domain and an amino-terminal alpha-helical 'tail' segment. The
alpha-helical segments associate to form 3-stranded coiled-coils, and
surface-exposed interchain disulfide linkages mediate the formation of
tail-to-tail hexamers. Analysis of serum samples showed that resistin
circulates in 2 distinct assembly states, likely corresponding to
hexamers and trimers. Infusion of a resistin mutant, lacking the
intertrimer disulfide bonds, in pancreatic insulin clamp studies
revealed substantially more potent effects on hepatic insulin
sensitivity than those observed with wildtype resistin.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Cao and Hegele (2001) identified 2 noncoding single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RSTN gene useful for the study of diabetes,
obesity, or disorders of adipocyte biology such as lipodystrophy.

Pizzuti et al. (2002) searched for polymorphisms in the resistin gene by
SSCP and direct sequencing. They identified an ATG triplet repeat in the
3-prime-untranslated region and considered it for association with
insulin resistance. They identified 3 alleles: allele 1, with 8 repeats
and an allele frequency of 0.3%; allele 2, with 7 repeats and an allele
frequency of 94.5%; and allele 3, with 6 repeats and an allele frequency
of 5.2%. Allele 1 was not tested for association with insulin resistance
because of its very low allele frequency. Among Sicilians, subjects
carrying allele 3 had lower fasting insulin and insulin resistance
index, and lower glucose and insulin levels during the oral glucose
tolerance test. In subjects from Gargano (a region geographically close
to Sicily but with a different ethnicity), those carrying allele 3 had
lower fasting plasma glucose levels and serum triglycerides. When the 2
populations were analyzed together, subjects carrying allele 3 had lower
fasting insulin levels (P less than 0.005), homeostasis model assessment
of insulin resistance (P less than 0.005), and serum triglycerides (P =
0.01). The authors concluded that subjects carrying the 6-repeat allele
of the resistin gene are characterized by relatively high insulin
sensitivity.

Wang et al. (2002) hypothesized that genetic variation in the RSTN gene
might explain the heritability of insulin action in familial type II
diabetes kindreds. They screened 44 subjects with type II diabetes and
20 nondiabetic family members who were at the extremes of insulin
sensitivity. They identified 8 noncoding SNPs and 1 GAT microsatellite
repeat. Three SNPs, which were in incomplete linkage disequilibrium with
each other and had allelic frequencies exceeding 5%, were selected for
further study. No SNP was associated with type II diabetes, but the SNP
in the promoter region was a significant determinant of insulin
sensitivity index (P = 0.04) among nondiabetic family members who had
undergone intravenous glucose tolerance tests. The authors concluded
that the 3 common SNPs showed statistical significance as determinants
of insulin sensitivity index (P less than 0.01) in interaction with body
mass index.

Ma et al. (2002) sequenced the resistin gene in 32 subjects with type II
diabetes and identified 8 SNPs in the 5-prime flanking region and
introns of the gene. Allele and genotype distributions were determined
for all 8 SNPs in 312 cases with type II diabetes and in 303 nondiabetic
controls, all of Caucasian origin. No significant association with type
II diabetes was found at any of the polymorphic loci; however, an
interactive effect of one SNP, IVS2+181G-A, with obesity was a
significant determinant of type II diabetes risk in this population.

Insulin resistance is a major cause of type II diabetes mellitus.
Resistin, an adipocyte-secreted hormone, antagonizes insulin. Transgenic
mice that overexpress Retn in adipose tissue are insulin resistant
(Pravenec et al., 2003), whereas Retn-null mice show lower fasting blood
glucose (Banerjee et al., 2004), suggesting that the altered Retn
promoter function could cause diabetes. To determine the possible role
of RETN in human type II diabetes, Osawa et al. (2004) analyzed
polymorphisms in its 5-prime flanking region. They found that the GG
genotype at the -420C-G SNP was associated with type II diabetes with an
adjusted odds ratio of 1.97 and could accelerate the onset of diabetes
by 4.9 years. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that the GG
genotype itself was a primary variant in determining type II diabetes
susceptibility. Functionally, transcription factors Sp1 (189906) and Sp3
(601804) bound specifically to the susceptible DNA element that included
-420G. Overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 enhanced RETN promoter activity.
Consistent with these findings, fasting serum resistin levels were
higher in type II diabetes patients with the GG genotype. Osawa et al.
(2004) concluded that the specific recognition of -420G by Sp1/3
increases RETN promoter activity, leading to enhanced serum resistin
levels, thereby inducing human type II diabetes.

Mattevi et al. (2004) studied the association of the -420C-G SNP of the
RETN gene with obesity-related phenotypes in 585 nondiabetic Brazilians
of European descent. In the 356 women in the study, the G allele was
somewhat less frequent in the overweight/obese group than in normal
weight individuals (p = 0.040). Female carriers of the G allele had a
lower mean BMI and waist circumference than C/C homozygotes (p = 0.010).
When women were stratified by menopausal status, the association was
restricted to premenopausal women. Mattevi et al. (2004) suggested that
RETN gene variation has gender-specific effects on BMI.

MAPPING

Steppan et al. (2001) localized the human resistin gene to a cloned
fragment of human chromosome 19 (GenBank GENBANK AC008763).

ANIMAL MODEL

Rajala et al. (2003) found that an infusion of either resistin or RETNLB
in rats rapidly induced severe hepatic but not peripheral insulin
resistance. Increases in circulating resistin or RETNLB levels markedly
stimulated hepatic glucose production despite the presence of fixed
physiologic insulin levels. This enhanced rate of glucose output was due
to increased flux through glucose-6-phosphatase. The results supported
the notion that a novel family of fat- and gut-derived circulating
proteins modulates hepatic insulin action.

Banerjee et al. (2004) generated mice deficient in resistin by targeted
disruption. Resistin-null mice exhibited low blood glucose levels after
fasting due to reduced hepatic glucose production. This was partly
mediated by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (see 602739) and
decreased expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in the liver. Banerjee et
al. (2004) suggested that their data supported a physiologic function
for resistin in the maintenance of blood glucose during fasting.
Remarkably, lack of resistin diminished the increase in post-fast blood
glucose normally associated with increased weight, suggesting a role for
resistin in mediating hyperglycemia associated with obesity.

To determine whether resistin plays a causative role in the development
of diet-induced insulin resistance, Muse et al. (2004) lowered
circulating resistin levels in mice by use of a specific antisense
oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO) directed against resistin mRNA and assessed
in vivo insulin action by the insulin clamp technique. After 3 weeks on
a high-fat diet, mice displayed severe insulin resistance associated
with an approximately 80% increase in plasma resistin levels. In
particular, the rate of endogenous glucose production increased more
than 2-fold compared with that in mice fed a standard chow. Treatment
with the resistin ASO for 1 week normalized the plasma resistin levels
and completely reversed the hepatic insulin resistance. Acute infusion
of purified recombinant mouse resistin in these mice, designed to
elevate acutely the levels of circulating resistin up to those observed
in the mice fed a high-fat diet, was sufficient to reconstitute hepatic
insulin resistance. These results provided strong support for the
physiologic role of resistin in the development of hepatic insulin
resistance.

RETN, +62G-A

Cao and Hegele (2001) identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
of the RETN gene, +62G-A, located 62 bp downstream of the last base of
the codon for termination in the 3-prime untranslated region of exon 4.

Tan et al. (2003) studied the association of the resistin gene +62G-A
polymorphism with type II diabetes (125853) in 1,102 Chinese type II
diabetes patients and 743 subjects without diabetes. Type II diabetes
subjects had a lower frequency of the A allele (GG:GA/AA, 83.5%:16.5%)
than did the controls (GG:GA/AA, 75.1%:24.9%; odds ratio, 1.524; 95% CI,
1.268-1.831; P less than 0.001). Unexpectedly, diabetic patients with
the GG genotype had a higher prevalence of hypertension (GG:GA/AA,
49.8%:36.2%; odds ratio, 1.375; 95% CI, 1.116-1.693; P = 0.001).
Logistic regression analysis confirmed that the +62G-A polymorphism acts
as an independent contributing factor to type II diabetes and
hypertension. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in
diabetic subjects with the GG genotype (144 +/- 21/87 +/- 13 mm Hg) were
significantly higher than those in subjects with GA/AA variants (139 +/-
21/84 +/- 14 mm Hg; P = 0.004 and P = 0.002, respectively). The authors
concluded that resistin may play a role in the pathogenesis of type II
diabetes and insulin resistance-related hypertension.

612092	TITLE *612092 MICRO RNA 200C; MIR200C
;;miRNA200C;;
MIRN200C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN200C, are 20- to 22-nucleotide noncoding
RNAs that inhibit gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by
binding to complementary sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs
(Park et al., 2008).

CLONING

Park et al. (2008) stated that miR200C belongs to the miR200 family of
miRNAs, which can be divided into 2 subfamilies based on a 1-nucleotide
difference in seed sequences. miR200A (612090) and miR141 (612093) have
a seed sequence of AACACUG, whereas miR200B (612091), miR200C, and
miR429 (612094) have a seed sequence of AAUACUG.

GENE FUNCTION

Park et al. (2008) evaluated expression of 207 miRNAs in 60 human cell
lines and found that expression of miR200 family members, including
miR200C, was associated with an epithelial phenotype. Expression of
these miRNAs showed a positive correlation with expression of E-cadherin
(CDH1; 192090), an epithelial cell marker, and a negative correlation
with expression of vimentin (VIM; 193060), a mesenchymal cell marker.
Park et al. (2008) identified multiple miR200 target sequences in the
3-prime UTRs of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 (189909)
and ZEB2 (605802). Using the 3-prime UTRs of mouse and human ZEB1 and
ZEB2, they showed that endogenous miR200s suppressed ZEB1 and ZEB2
expression. Increasing the levels of miR200A and miR200C induced
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in human cancer cell lines,
reducing their aggressiveness. Conversely, reducing miR200 levels
induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Park et al. (2008)
concluded that the miR200 family regulates EMT/MET by targeting ZEB1 and
ZEB2, which control expression of E-cadherin.

Using the MDCK canine epithelial cell line and a subclone with a
mesenchymal phenotype, Gregory et al. (2008) independently showed that
the miR200 family, including miR141, and miR205 (613147) regulated
expression of Zeb1 and Zeb2 and controlled EMT. Furthermore, expression
of the miR200 family and miR205 was lost in invasive human breast cancer
cell lines with mesenchymal phenotype and in primary breast cancer
specimens lacking E-cadherin.

Shimono et al. (2009) showed that MIR200C downregulated expression of
BMI1 (164831), a regulator of stem cell self-renewal. Expression of
MIR200C resulted in growth retardation and differentiation in Tera-2
cells, suppressed clonogenicity in mouse breast cancer cells, reduced
tumorigenicity of human breast cancer stem cells in immunocompromised
mice, and suppressed mammary outgrowth from normal mouse mammary stem
cells in vivo. Shimono et al. (2009) concluded that MIR200C provides a
molecular link between normal and cancerous stem cells.

MAPPING

Park et al. (2008) stated that the miR200 family members MIRN200C and
MIRN141 are clustered on chromosome 12, whereas MIRN200A, MIRN200B, and
MIRN429 are clustered on chromosome 1.

613117	TITLE *613117 SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNA, C/D BOX, 50A; SNORD50A
;;RNA, U50 SMALL NUCLEOLAR; RNU50;;
snoRNA, U50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SNORD50A belongs to the C/D box class of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs),
which are thought to function as guide RNAs in the site-specific ribose
methylation of preribosomal RNA (Kiss-Laszlo et al., 1996).

CLONING

Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) isolated SNORD50A, which they called RNU50,
from a cDNA library of intronic snoRNAs from HeLa cells. RNU50 is 74
nucleotides long.

GENE FUNCTION

Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) found that a 15-nucleotide sequence of RNU50
was complementary to a region near the D box of 28S ribosomal RNA (see
180450), and that a 12-nucleotide sequence of RNU50 was complementary to
a region near the D-prime box of 28S RNA. These regions of 28S RNA
contain an O-methylcytosine and a potential O-methylguanine,
respectively. Kiss-Laszlo et al. (1996) hypothesized that RNU50 may have
a role in methylation of 28S RNA at these sites.

Using Northern blot analysis and real-time PCR, Dong et al. (2008)
showed that expression of snoRNA U50 was downregulated in a significant
number of primary prostate cancer specimens and prostate cancer cell
lines. Ectopic expression of snoRNA U50 significantly reduced colony
formation in the 2 prostate cancer cell lines examined.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tanaka et al. (2000) determined that the
SNORD50A gene lies within intron 5 of the SNHG5 gene (613263) on
chromosome 6q15.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Dong et al. (2008) identified a homozygous 2-bp (TT) germline deletion
in the SNORD50A gene in 2 (2%) of 89 unrelated patients with prostate
cancer but not in 104 men without prostate cancer. A somatic homozygous
TT deletion was found 2 of 30 prostate cancer cell lines or xenografts,
and 9 of 89 localized prostate cancers (total, 11 (9%) of 119 cancers).
The homozygous deletion abolished U50 suppressive function in a colony
formation assay, suggesting that SNORD50A is a tumor suppressor gene and
that germline mutation may increase susceptibility to prostate cancer.
Further analysis of 1,371 prostate cancer patients and 1,371 matched
controls showed that a heterozygous germline TT deletion was found at
similar levels in patients and controls, suggesting that it may be a
common polymorphism.

606045	TITLE *606045 INTRAFLAGELLAR TRANSPORT 122, CHLAMYDOMONAS, HOMOLOG OF; IFT122
;;WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 10; WDR10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

A conserved core of 4 or more modular repeat units defines a group of
functionally diverse regulatory proteins in eukaryotes known as the WD
repeat family. WD repeats are minimally conserved regions of
approximately 40 amino acids typically bracketed by gly-his and trp-asp
(GH-WD), which may facilitate formation of heterotrimeric or
multiprotein complexes. Proteins belonging to the WD repeat family are
involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle
progression, signal transduction, apoptosis, and gene regulation
(summary by Claudio et al., 1999).

CLONING

Gross et al. (2001) screened human HL60 leukemia and prostate and colon
cancer cDNA libraries with degenerate oligonucleotide primers directed
to sequences encoding the AF2 domains of class III nuclear receptors.
They then used 5-prime and 3-prime RACE and screening of a testis cDNA
library to clone IFT122, which they designated WDR10. They also isolated
a longer variant of this cDNA, which appeared to have an additional
153-bp exon near the 5-prime end. The full-length WDR10 cDNA encodes a
deduced 1,242-amino acid protein with an AF2-like domain, 7 N-terminal
WD repeat units, and 2 potential nuclear localization sequences.
Northern blot analysis detected a single 4-kb WDR10 transcript in most
tissues tested, with predominant expression in testis and pituitary; a
3.5-kb transcript was detected in HL60 leukemia cells. Study of a
WDR10-GFP fusion protein demonstrated that WDR10 is localized in the
cytoplasm. In situ hybridization on reproductive tissues in the rat
showed stage-specific expression of WDR10 within developing sperm and
ovarian follicles.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gross et al. (2001) determined that the IFT122 gene has at least 28
exons spanning approximately 65 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

By FISH, Gross et al. (2001) mapped the IFT122 gene to chromosome 3q21.

GENE FUNCTION

Walczak-Sztulpa et al. (2010) performed morpholino knockdown of ift122
in zebrafish embryos and observed defects typical of other ciliopathy
models including shortened body axis and curvature, cardiac edema, and
small eyes at 80 hours postfertilization, with pronephric cysts and a
distended cranium consistent with hydrocephalus and otolith defects at 5
days postfertilization. Cilia and their basal bodies were dramatically
reduced in the pronephric duct of morphant embryos compared to control
embryos, and primary cilia shortening was observed in the morphant
zebrafish Kupffer vesicle.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a consanguineous Polish family with cranioectodermal dysplasia
mapping to chromosome 3q21-q24 (CED1; 218330), Walczak-Sztulpa et al.
(2010) sequenced 79 candidate genes and identified homozygosity for a
missense mutation in the IFT122 gene (V553G; 606045.0001) that
segregated with the disease. Fibroblasts from 1 of the sibs showed
significantly reduced cilia frequency and length compared to controls.
Analysis of IFT122 in 11 additional unrelated patients with CED revealed
homozygosity and compound heterozygosity for mutations in 2 of the
patients (606045.0002-606045.0004, respectively).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CRANIOECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA 1
IFT122, VAL553GLY

In an affected sister and brother with cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED1;
218330), born of distantly related Polish parents, Walczak-Sztulpa et
al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a T-G transversion in the IFT122
gene, resulting in a val553-to-gly (V553G) substitution at a highly
conserved residue. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 340 ethnically matched control
chromosomes. Analysis of fibroblasts from the brother showed
significantly reduced cilia frequency and length compared to 3
unrelated, healthy German controls.

In a boy with cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED1; 218330), born of
fourth-cousin Norwegian parents and previously reported by Fry et al.
(2009), Walczak-Sztulpa et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a C-T
transition in the IFT122 gene, resulting in a ser373-to-phe (S373F)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. The unaffected parents were
heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 340 ethnically
matched control chromosomes. The patient had an unaffected sister.

In an Italian boy with cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED1; 218330),
originally reported by Zaffanello et al. (2006), Walczak-Sztulpa et al.
(2010) identified compound heterozygosity for a G-A transition in intron
6 (502+5G-A) of the IFT122 gene and a de novo trp7-to-cys substitution
(W7C; 606045.0004) at a highly conserved residue in exon 1. The mother
was a heterozygous carrier of the splice site mutation but the missense
mutation was not detected in either parent; neither mutation was found
in 340 ethnically matched control chromosomes.

186820	TITLE *186820 T-CELL ANTIGEN CD7; CD7
;;Tp41
DESCRIPTION The CD7 antigen is a cell surface glycoprotein found on thymocytes and
mature T cells. It is one of the earliest antigens to appear on cells of
the T-lymphocyte lineage and the most reliable clinical marker of T-cell
acute lymphocytic leukemia. Aruffo and Seed (1987) isolated and
sequenced a full-length CD7 cDNA as well as a cDNA for an unusual
intron-bearing precursor. They found that COS cells expressing CD7 do
not bind IgM. Van Dongen et al. (1985) assigned T-cell antigen Tp41
(CD7) to chromosome 17 by somatic cell hybridization. Osada et al.
(1988) confirmed the location of CD7 on chromosome 17 by studying
reactivity with Tp40 antibody in hybrid human-mouse T-cell clones. By
chromosomal in situ hybridization, Baker et al. (1990) localized CD7 to
17q25.2-q25.3. Schanberg et al. (1991) isolated and characterized the
human CD7 gene and its 5-prime flanking region; the gene comprises 4
exons that span 3.5 kb. Comparison of the organization of the CD7 gene
with that of other members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily
revealed that the human CD7 gene most closely resembles the murine Thy-1
gene (188230). Both genes have 4 exons and promoters with no TATA boxes.
Yoshikawa et al. (1991) cloned and characterized the CD7 gene.

Jung et al. (1986) found that the T-cell surface membrane-associated
glycoprotein CD7, which they referred to as Tp40 (40,000 MW), was not
expressed by the T cells of a patient with severe combined
immunodeficiency. In addition to this abnormality, T-cell proliferative
responses to mitogens were defective and the IL2 receptor expression was
deficient on the patient's T lymphocytes. However, his T cells were
found to provide help for the differentiation of normal B cells to
Ig-secreting cells. Abundant circulating B cells were detected. The
findings were interpreted as supporting the idea that the Tp40
deficiency was related to a defect in T-cell precursors, and that Tp40
plays an essential role not only in T-cell interactions but also in
certain aspects of T-cell/B-cell interaction during early lymphoid
development. However, Bonilla et al. (1997) found that targeted
disruption of the mouse CD7 gene (located on chromosome 11 in that
species), with resulting CD7 deficiency, was associated with normal
histology of thymus and spleen, normal lymphocyte populations in primary
and secondary lymphoid tissues, and normal serum Ig levels. Specific
antibody responses after immunization with T-dependent and T-independent
antigens were equivalent in wildtype and CD7 knockout mice.
CD7-deficient lymphocytes responded normally to T-cell mitogenic and
allogeneic stimuli, and displayed normal NK cell cytotoxicity.

614471	TITLE *614471 UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE 19; USP19
;;KIAA0891
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

USP19 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (EC 3.4.19.12) with a role in
regulating cell cycle progression (Lu et al., 2009).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned USP19, which they designated
KIAA0891. The deduced 1,371-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with the ubiquitin protease UNPH (USP4; 603486). RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest expression in fetal liver, followed by adult spinal
cord. All other tissues, including adult and fetal brain, showed much
lower expression, and no expression was detected in spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that
regulates the G1/S transition. Using rat myoblast and fibroblast cell
lines, Lu et al. (2009) showed that Usp19 regulated p27(KIP1) levels by
deubiquitinating and stabilizing Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472), an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that ubiquitinates cytosolic p27(KIP1) and targets it for
proteasomal degradation at G1 phase. Immunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that Usp19 interacted directly with Kpc1. Knockdown of Usp19
resulted in loss of Kpc1, accumulation of p27(KIP1), inhibition of cell
proliferation, and slower progression from G0/G1 to S phase.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the USP19 gene
to chromosome 3.

Hartz (2011) mapped the USP19 gene to chromosome 3p21.31 based on an
alignment of the USP19 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB020698) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GTF2IRD1 gene was identified within the chromosomal region on
7q11.23 commonly deleted in Williams syndrome (194050) and is involved
in mammalian craniofacial and cognitive development (Tassabehji et al.,
2005).

CLONING

Tassabehji et al. (1999) isolated and characterized a 3.4-kb gene, which
they called general transcription factor III (GTF3), which occupies
about 140 kb of the region deleted in Williams syndrome. Northern blot
analysis showed that the gene is expressed in skeletal muscle and heart,
and RT-PCR analysis showed expression in a range of adult tissues with
stronger expression in fetal tissues. Part of the conceptual GTF3
protein sequence was found to be almost identical to a slow muscle-fiber
enhancer binding protein identified by O'Mahoney et al. (1998) and
termed MusTRD1. GTF3 showed significant homology to the 90-amino acid
putative helix-loop-helix repeat (HLH) domains of the transcription
factor TFII-I (GTF2I; 601679), which maps distal to GTF4 within the
Williams syndrome deleted region.

Osborne et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they termed
WBSCR11, by genomic DNA sequence analysis and screening of 2 colon
carcinoma cell line cDNA libraries. The cDNA sequence predicts an
895-amino acid protein.

Franke et al. (1999) cloned GTF2IRD1 from cDNA libraries representing
several diverse tissues, and they obtained a full-length cDNA by 5-prime
RACE of an adult brain cDNA library. They also identified several splice
variants arising from exon skipping. The longest deduced protein
contains 944 amino acids. In addition to the repeated GTF2I motifs and
HLH repeats, Franke et al. (1999) identified a myc (190080)-type HLH
dimerization domain, a number of putative phosphorylation sites and
N-myristoylation sites, an amidation site, and several putative nuclear
localization signals. Northern blot analysis detected expression of
GTF2IRD1 in all adult and fetal tissues except leukocytes. The dominant
transcript was 3.6 kb long, with sizes ranging from 1.5 kb to 5.0 kb.

By Western blot analysis, Yan et al. (2000) found that endogenous
GTF2IRD1, which they designated CREAM1, was expressed at low levels as a
120-kD protein in a variety of human cell lines and tissues. GTF2IRD1
was expressed in the nucleus of transfected cells, and deletion of the
C-terminal nuclear localization signal resulted in cytoplasmic
expression.

Bayarsaihan and Ruddle (2000) cloned mouse Gtf2ird1, which they
designated Ben. The deduced full-length 1,072-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal leucine zipper motif, followed by 6
helix-loop-helix domains, a nuclear localization signal, and a
C-terminal serine-rich region. Northern blot analysis detected several
Ben transcripts in all mouse tissues examined. Western blot analysis
showed several Ben isoforms with apparent molecular masses of 40 to 165
kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Osborne et al. (1999) determined that the WBSCR11 gene spans 95 kb of
genomic DNA and consists of 26 exons, not including the last noncoding
exon.

Franke et al. (1999) determined that the GTF2IRD1 gene contains up to 30
exons and spans about 105 kb. The coding sequence uses 26 exons.

Palmer et al. (2010) determined that the region upstream of the GTF2IRD1
gene contains a well-conserved CCAAT box and 3 canonical
GTF2IRD1-recognition sequences (GGATTA), one of which is inverted.

MAPPING

Franke et al. (1999) reported that the GF2IRD1 gene maps within the WBS
deletion region on chromosome 7q11.23 and is oriented 5-prime to 3-prime
in the centromeric to telomeric orientation.

Tassabehji et al. (1999) tabulated 11 genes in addition to GTF3 that had
been mapped to the deleted area of chromosome 7 in classic Williams
syndrome.

Lazebnik et al. (2008) stated that the mouse Gtf2ird1 gene maps to a
region of chromosome 5 that shares homology of synteny with human
chromosome 7.

GENE FUNCTION

Yan et al. (2000) determined that GTF2IRD1 interacted with the RB1
protein (614041) in vitro and in vivo. They also showed that full length
GTF2IRD1 stimulated transcription of a reporter gene and, by mutation
analysis, they localized the activation domain to the N terminus.

Using yeast 1-hybrid analysis, Bayarsaihan and Ruddle (2000) showed that
in vitro-translated mouse Ben interacted with an early enhancer upstream
of the Hoxc8 (142970) transcription start site.

Ring et al. (2002) characterized the Xenopus homolog of GTF2IRD1,
Xwbscr11. They determined that Xwbscr11 binds DNA via selective HLH
repeats and interacts with the transcription factor FOXH1 (603621) and
the signal transduction molecules Smad2 (601366) and Smad3 (603109) to
affect activin (147290)/nodal-mediated induction of the distal element
of the Xenopus goosecoid promoter.

Vullhorst and Buonanno (2003) characterized mouse Gtf3 splice variants.
They determined that HLH domain 4 is necessary and sufficient for
binding the bicoid-like motif of the troponin (191042) enhancer. An
isoform that lacks exon 23 and exons 26 through 28 interacted most
avidly with the bicoid-like motif. Isoforms that included these exons
failed to bind in gel retardation assays. The authors also determined
that Gtf3 polypeptides associate with each other via the leucine zipper.

Lazebnik et al. (2008) showed that BEN bound the 8-bp core consensus
sequence CAG(C/G)G(C/A)GA, surrounded by G- and C-rich sequences. BEN
repressed expression of a reporter gene containing 3 copies of the
sequence 5-prime-GGGGGCAGCGACAGCCCCC-3-prime. Knockdown of Ben
expression in C2C12 mouse myoblasts enhanced expression of Bmpr1b
(603248), Sox4 (184430), En1 (131290), and Fgf15, the mouse ortholog of
FGF19 (603891). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis followed by
quantitative PCR confirmed binding of BEN to Fgf15.

Palmer et al. (2010) found that GTF2IRD1 is subject to negative
autoregulation. All isoforms of mouse or human GTF2IRD1 bound 3
canonical GTF2IRD1-binding sites (GGATTA) in the region upstream of the
GTF2IRD1 gene. EMSA using artificial DNA probes and in vitro-translated
GTF2IRD1 revealed enhanced binding in the presence of 3 GGATTA sites and
dimerization of GTF2IRD1 proteins via an N-terminal leucine zipper
region. Binding by GTF2IRD1 repressed expression of a reporter gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tassabehji et al. (1999) found that GTF3 was deleted in patients with
classic Williams syndrome, but not in patients with partial deletions
who had only supravalvular aortic stenosis. They suggested that
haploinsufficiency of the GTF3 gene may be the cause of the abnormal
muscle fatigability that is characteristic of Williams syndrome.

Tassabehji et al. (2005) reported a rare WBS individual with an atypical
deletion, including the GTF2IRD1 gene, showed facial dysmorphism and
cognitive deficits that differed from those of classic WBS cases. They
proposed a mechanism of cumulative dosage effects of duplicated and
diverged genes applicable to other human chromosomal disorders.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tassabehji et al. (2005) demonstrated that GTF2IRD1 is involved in
mammalian craniofacial and cognitive development. Gtf2ird1-null mice
exhibited phenotypic abnormalities reminiscent of the human
microdeletion disorder Williams-Beuren syndrome; craniofacial imaging
revealed abnormalities in both skull and jaws that may arise through
misregulation of goosecoid (138890), a downstream target of Gtf2ird1.

Palmer et al. (2010) found that mutant mice lacking Gtf2ird1 exon 2
expressed a mutant Gtf2ird1 transcript. The mutant transcript was
expressed at wildtype levels due to escape from nonsense mediated decay
and escape from negative autoregulation by Gtf2ird1 itself.

607082	TITLE *607082 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, ALPHA-2/DELTA SUBUNIT 2; CACNA2D2
;;KIAA0558
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The CACNA2D2 gene encodes the alpha-2-delta-2 auxiliary subunit of high
voltage-gated calcium channels. Auxiliary subunits modulate calcium
current and channel activation and inactivation kinetics, and may be
involved in proper assembly and membrane localization of the channels.
Alpha-2-delta-2 is a receptor for the antiepileptic drug gabapentin
(summary by Edvardson et al., 2013).

CLONING

By searching for sequences with the potential to encode large proteins
expressed in brain, Nagase et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding
CACNA2D2, which they called KIAA0558. The deduced 1,145-amino acid
protein was predicted to be 45% identical to mouse Cacna2d2. RT-PCR
analysis detected ubiquitous expression.

Using a positional cloning strategy to identify a putative tumor
suppressor gene on chromosome 3p21.3, Gao et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA
encoding CACNA2D2. The CACNA2D2 protein is 56% identical to CACNA2D1
(114204), and 17 of 22 cysteines in CACNA2D2 are conserved in CACNA2S1,
suggesting similar secondary structures. CACNA2D2 also has multiple
putative N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a 5.5-kb transcript that was most abundant in lung and
testis, followed by brain, heart, and pancreas, with low levels in
prostate and skeletal muscle. Some lung cancer lines expressed CACNA2D2.
Western blot analysis showed expression of a 150-kD protein, larger than
the predicted 130 kD, presumably due to glycosylation. Functional
analysis indicated that CACNA2D2 is able to act as an auxiliary subunit
of all 3 subfamilies of voltage-gated calcium channels.

By physical cloning methodologies and bioinformatic computational
analyses, Lerman and Minna (2000) identified a number of genes,
including CACNA2D2, in a region of chromosome 3p21.3 that is associated
with a putative lung cancer tumor suppressor gene. They did not detect
CACNA2D2 mutations in any lung cancer cell lines tested.

Each alpha-2-delta subunit is encoded by a single gene and
post-translationally cleaved into a long, N-terminal, extracellular
alpha-2 protein and a shorter, membrane-anchored delta polypeptide; the
alpha-2 and delta proteins are covalently linked by disulfide bonds
(summary by Brill et al., 2004).

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerman and Minna (2000) determined that
the CACNA2D2 gene contains at least 40 exons and spans approximately 140
kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the CACNA2D2
gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Gao et al. (2000)
refined the localization to 3p21.3, a site of frequent deletions in
breast and lung cancers.

GENE FUNCTION

Hoppa et al. (2012) showed that a trafficking step probably sets
synaptic voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) levels in rats, because
overexpression of the pore-forming alpha-1A VGCC subunit (CACNA1A;
601011) fails to change synaptic VGCC abundance or function.
Alpha-2-deltas are a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored VGCC-associated subunits that, in addition to being the
target of the potent neuropathic analgesics gabapentin and pregabalin
(alpha-2-delta-1 (CACNA2D1) and alpha-2-delta-2 (CACNA2D2)), were also
identified in a forward genetic screen for pain genes (alpha-2-delta-3
(CACNA2D3; 606399)). Hoppa et al. (2012) showed that these proteins
confer powerful modulation of presynaptic function through 2 distinct
molecular mechanisms. First, alpha-2-delta subunits set synaptic VGCC
abundance, as predicted from their chaperone-like function when
expressed in nonneuronal cells. Second, alpha-2-deltas configure
synaptic VGCCs to drive exocytosis through an extracellular metal
ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), a conserved set of amino acids
within the predicted von Willebrand A domain of alpha-2-delta.
Expression of alpha-2-delta with an intact MIDAS motif leads to an 80%
increase in release probability, while simultaneously protecting
exocytosis from blockade by an intracellular calcium chelator.
Alpha-2-deltas harboring MIDAS site mutations still drive synaptic
accumulation of VGCCs; however, they no longer change release
probability or sensitivity to intracellular calcium chelators. Hoppa et
al. (2012) concluded that their data reveal dual functionality of these
clinically important VGCC subunits, allowing synapses to make more
efficient use of calcium entry to drive neurotransmitter release.

ANIMAL MODEL

Brodbeck et al. (2002) showed that mice with the 'ducky' (du) mutation,
a model for absence epilepsy (see 600131), had a mutation in Cacna2d2
gene. The mutation resulted in the introduction of a premature stop
codon and the expression of a truncated protein encoded by the first 3
exons of Cacna2d2, followed by 8 novel amino acids. The shortened mRNA
and protein were expressed in mutant mouse cerebellum and Purkinje
cells. Brodbeck et al. (2002) detected high expression of the normal
protein in cerebellar Purkinje cells, but found that ducky mice had
abnormalities in their Purkinje cell dendritic trees. Functional
analysis indicated that the mutant Cacna2d2 protein failed to increase
or even decreased the peak current density of the voltage-gated Ca(V)2.1
(CACNA1A; 601011)/beta-4 (CACNB4; 601949) channel combination,
suggesting that it may contribute to the ducky phenotype.

Brill et al. (2004) identified a recessive mouse phenotype, 'entla,'
caused by an in-frame duplication of 39 amino acids in the Cacna2d2
gene, resulting in expression of a full-length, membrane-associated
protein, but with loss of the disulfide linkage between the 2 derived
proteins. Mutant mice developed ataxia by postnatal day 13 to 15
followed by paroxysmal dyskinesia. The mice showed reduced size and
weight, increased mortality before weaning, and female infertility. EEG
studies suggested absence epilepsy, with 2- and 4-Hz spike-wave
discharges in the cortex and hippocampus. Cerebellar Purkinje cells
isolated from mutant mice showed about a 50% reduction in current, as
well as a reduction of gabapentin binding to the membrane compared to
wildtype and to heterozygous mice. Entla (ent) mice showed no
neuroanatomical abnormalities.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CACNA2D2, LEU1040PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy has not
been confirmed.

In 3 sibs, born of consanguineous Arab-Palestinian parents, with early
infantile epileptic encephalopathy, global developmental delay, and
cerebellar atrophy, Edvardson et al. (2013) identified a homozygous
3119A-G transition in the CACNA2D2 gene, resulting in a leu1040-to-pro
(L1040P) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The variant, which
was identified by linkage analysis combined with whole-exome sequencing,
was not found in 102 controls or in 6,503 control exomes. In vitro
expression studies in Xenopus oocytes showed that the variant protein
decreased currents of N- and L-type calcium channels and caused slower
inactivation in N-type channels. Although the variant protein was
expressed, it showed decreased localization to the plasma membrane
compared to wildtype, suggesting that it may not properly associate with
the alpha-1 subunit. Edvardson et al. (2013) postulated that prolonged
channel opening and calcium influx during depolarization associated with
delayed inactivation may underlie the epileptic phenotype observed in
these patients. There was no evidence for a dominant-negative effect.
Exome sequencing in 1 of the 3 affected sibs also identified a
homozygous C-to-T transition in the CELSR3 gene (604264), resulting in a
met2630-to-ile (M2630I; 604264.0001) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. This variant also segregated with the disease state in the
family. Inactivation of Celsr3 in mice causes abnormalities in
connectivity in the cerebral cortex (Zhou et al., 2008). Edvardson et
al. (2013) could not exclude a role for the CELSR3 mutation in the
epileptic phenotype in this family.

610611	TITLE *610611 GINS COMPLEX SUBUNIT 4; GINS4
;;SLD5, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; SLD5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The yeast heterotetrameric GINS complex is made up of Sld5, Psf1 (GINS1;
610608), Psf2 (GINS2; 610609), and Psf3 (GINS3; 610610). The formation
of the GINS complex is essential for the initiation of DNA replication
in yeast and Xenopus egg extracts (Ueno et al., 2005). See GINS1 for
additional information about the GINS complex.

CLONING

By searching a human database for sequences similar to yeast SLD5,
Takayama et al. (2003) identified GINS4, which they called SLD5. The
deduced protein contains 223 amino acids.

Using mouse Psf1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid analysis of an 11-day mouse
embryo cDNA library, Kong et al. (2006) cloned Sld5. The deduced
223-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a
central basic region, and a C-terminal domain that is conserved between
the mouse and yeast proteins. RT-PCR of mouse tissues detected abundant
expression in adult testis, and weak expression in thymus and bone
marrow. No Sld5 was detected in brain, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and
heart. Immunohistochemical analysis detected Psf1 and Sld5 in the
cytoplasm of transfected NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Kong et al. (2006) demonstrated that
mouse Sld5 and Psf1 interacted in transfected NIH3T3 cells.

MAPPING

International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GINS4 gene
to chromosome 8 (TMAP RH102031).

NOMENCLATURE

The GINS complex derives its name from the Japanese words Go, Ichi, Nii,
and San, which mean 5, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and refer to the
numbering of the yeast homologs of the GINS complex (Takayama et al.,
2003).
