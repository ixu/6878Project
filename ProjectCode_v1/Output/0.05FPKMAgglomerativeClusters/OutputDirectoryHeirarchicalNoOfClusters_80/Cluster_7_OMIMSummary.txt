600448	TITLE *600448 PROTEIN KINASE C, THETA; PRKCQ
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases
play critical roles in the regulation of cellular differentiation and
proliferation of diverse cell types. In an attempt to find PKC isoforms
involved in growth control and/or activation of T lymphocytes, Baier et
al. (1993) used a human peripheral blood lymphocyte-derived cDNA library
to identify a novel PKC isoform, termed PKC-theta. The gene encodes a
protein of approximately 80 kD, expressed predominantly in lymphoid
tissues and hematopoietic cell lines, particularly T cells.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Erdel et al. (1995) assigned the
PRKCQ gene to chromosome 10p15. Blanco and Brown (1997) mapped the mouse
Prkcq homolog to chromosome 2 by analysis of an interspecific backcross.

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse mammary tumors, Belguise and Sonenshein (2007) identified Prkcq
as a positive regulator of c-Rel (REL; 164910) transcriptional activity,
as well as downstream target genes. In human breast cancer cell lines,
there was an inverse correlation between ESR1 (133430) and PRKCQ mRNA,
and PRKCQ was found to inhibit ESR1 expression via activation of AKT1
(164730). Belguise and Sonenshein (2007) concluded that PRKCQ plays a
pivotal role in mammary tumorigenesis by activating AKT1, which
ultimately leads to derepression of c-Rel through inhibition of ESR1.

Zanin-Zhorov et al. (2010) showed that PKC-theta recruitment to the
immunologic synapse is required for full effector T cell (T-eff)
activation. In contrast, PKC-theta was sequestered away from the
regulatory T cell (T-reg) immunologic synapse. Furthermore, PKC-theta
blockade enhanced T-reg function, demonstrating that PKC-theta inhibits
T-reg-mediated suppression. Inhibition of PKC-theta protected T-reg
cells from inactivation by TNF-alpha (191160), restored activity of
defective T-regs from rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300) patients, and
enhanced protection of mice from inflammatory colitis. Zanin-Zhorov et
al. (2010) concluded that T-reg cells freed of PKC-theta-mediated
inhibition can function in the presence of inflammatory cytokines.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sun et al. (2000) demonstrated that PKC-theta is essential for T-cell
antigen receptor (TCR)-mediated T-cell activation, but dispensable
during TCR-dependent thymocyte development. They generated mice
deficient in Pkc-theta by homologous recombination. Mutant mice were
normal and fertile. TCR-initiated NF-kappa-B (see 164011) activation was
absent from Pkc-theta -/- mature T lymphocytes, but was intact in
thymocytes. Activation of NF-kappa-B by tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(191160) and interleukin-1 (see 147760) was unaffected in the mutant
mice. Induction of Jnk (see 601158) was normal in T cells from mutant
mice. Sun et al. (2000) concluded that PKC-theta functions in a unique
pathway that links the TCR signaling complex to the activation of
NF-kappa-B in mature T lymphocytes.

Using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, Kim et al. (2004) demonstrated
that skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin action did not differ between
wildtype and Pkc-theta-null mice. A 5-hour lipid infusion decreased
insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake in the wildtype mice
that was associated with 40 to 50% decreases in insulin-stimulated
tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1; 147545)
and IRS1-associated PI3K (see 171834) activity. In contrast, Pkc-theta
inactivation prevented fat-induced defects in insulin signaling and
glucose transport in skeletal muscle. Kim et al. (2004) concluded that
PKC-theta is a crucial component mediating fat-induced insulin
resistance in skeletal muscle.

Tan et al. (2006) found that Pkc-theta -/- mice resisted development of
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of central
nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease. Flow cytometric and
histopathologic analyses revealed a profound reduction in T-cell and
macrophage infiltration and demyelination. Stimulation of splenic T
cells from Pkc-theta -/- mice resulted in significantly reduced
production of Ifng (147570) and Il17 (603149), despite comparable levels
of Il2 (147680) and Il4 (147780) and no difference in
lymphoproliferation. After TCR activation, Pkc-theta -/- T cells failed
to upregulate the adhesion molecule Lfa1 (see ITGB2; 600065).
Immunohistochemical analysis showed reduced expression of Il17 in the
CNS of Pkc-theta -/- mice. Tan et al. (2006) concluded that PKC-theta is
important in the regulation of multiple T-cell functions necessary for
development of autoimmune disease.

603872	TITLE *603872 TROPHININ-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; TROAP
;;TROPHININ-ASSISTING PROTEIN;;
TASTIN
DESCRIPTION See trophinin (300132). One essential feature of implantation is the
formation of allogeneic and heterotypic cell-to-cell contacts between
embryonic and maternal cells. Fukuda et al. (1995) identified trophinin
and tastin (trophinin-assisting protein) as molecules that mediate the
cell adhesion between HT-H trophoblastic cells and SNG-M endometrial
adenocarcinoma cells. Proline residues make up 16% of the predicted
778-amino acid tastin protein. One region of the protein contains 4
tandem repeats and is rich in cysteines. In vitro translated tastin has
a molecular mass of 80 kD. Immunofluorescence studies with mammalian
cells expressing trophinin alone or in combination with tastin indicated
that tastin creates multivalent trophinin patches on the cell surface
that serve as potent adhesion sites. In both HT-H and SNG-M cells,
tastin localized as a diffuse cytoplasmic protein and in fibers,
suggesting that it associates with the cytoskeleton. Northern blot
analysis revealed that tastin is expressed as a major 3.2- and a minor
3.5-kb mRNA in HT-H and SNG-M cells. However, tastin did not appear to
be expressed in various other types of human cells, with the exception
of macrophages. Based on the expression pattern of tastin and trophinin
in vivo and the activity of the cloned proteins, Fukuda et al. (1995)
suggested that these proteins might mediate the adhesion of the
blastocyst to the endometrial epithelium at the time of implantation. By
immunohistochemistry of placenta from the sixth week of pregnancy,
Suzuki et al. (1999) found that tastin was exclusively localized to the
apical side of the syncytiotrophoblast.

;;TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEAT-CONTAINING GENE 4; TNRC4;;
BRUNO-LIKE 1; BRUNOL1;;
CUGBP- AND ETR3-LIKE FACTOR 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF3, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for human sequences similar to Xenopus Brunol1,
Good et al. (2000) identified a partial sequence for TNRC4, which they
called BRUNOL1. The partial human protein shares 91% amino acid identity
with Xenopus Brunol1.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to CUGBP (601074),
followed by PCR of a human brain cDNA library, Ladd et al. (2001) cloned
TNRC4, which they called CELF3. The deduced 462-amino acid protein
contains 2 N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a C-terminal RRM,
several potential phosphorylation sites, and a nuclear localization
signal near the C terminus. Ladd et al. (2001) also identified a region
of allelic variation in CELF3 in which a variable number of CAG repeats
encode a stretch of glutamines of unfixed length. RNA dot blot analysis
detected CELF3 expression only in brain.

Using RNA dot blot analysis, Ladd et al. (2004) found that CELF3 was
highly expressed in several adult brain regions, in pituitary, and in
fetal brain.

By Western blot analysis of adult human cortex, Chapple et al. (2007)
showed that the full-length 465-amino acid TNRC4 protein had an apparent
molecular mass of about 50 kD. Epitope-tagged TNRC4 was expressed in the
nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells.
Removal of RRM3 led to exclusion of TNRC4 from the nucleus, confirming
the presence of a C-terminal nuclear localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Ladd et al. (2001) showed that all human CELF proteins, including CELF3,
bound RNA containing muscle-specific splicing enhancer (MSE) elements
and could activate MSE-dependent exon inclusion of cardiac troponin T
(TNNT2; 191045) minigenes in transfected quail fibroblasts.

By RT-PCR analysis of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, Chapple
et al. (2007) showed that TNRC4 activated inclusion of exon 10 in a tau
(MAPT; 157140) minigene. Deletion and mutation analyses showed that the
activity of TNRC4 on tau exon 10 splicing required RRM2 in TNRC4 and an
intronic element in tau pre-mRNA. The polyglutamine sequence of TNRC4
had no effect on tau exon 10 splicing. Tnrc4 -/- mice exhibited
decreased inclusion of exon 10 in tau mRNA.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the TNRC4 gene
to chromosome 1q21.

179060	TITLE *179060 PYRUVATE DEHYDROGENASE, BETA POLYPEPTIDE; PDHB
;;PYRUVATE DEHYDROGENASE COMPLEX, E1 BETA POLYPEPTIDE; PHE1B
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Pyruvate decarboxylase is a tetramer consisting of 2 alpha subunits
(PDHA1; 300502) and 2 beta subunits. The enzyme, which is found in
mitochondria, is one of the component enzymes of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDH). It catalyzes the first reaction
of an oxidative decarboxylation sequence converting pyruvate to
acetyl-CoA and CO(2) (summary by Koike et al., 1988).

CLONING

Koike et al. (1988) cloned and sequenced cDNAs encoding the alpha and
the beta subunits.

Ho et al. (1988) isolated a 1.5-kb cDNA clone for the beta subunit of E1
from a human liver gamma-gt11 cDNA library using anti-E1 serum.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe, Olson et al. (1990) demonstrated that the PHE1B gene
is located on 3p13-q23.

GENE STRUCTURE

Koike et al. (1990) described the molecular cloning of the entire human
PHE1B gene, its characterization by restriction enzyme analysis, and its
complete nucleotide sequence. The PHE1B gene contains 10 exons. All
intron-exon splice junctions follow the GT/AG rule. The Alu family was
found in introns 2 and 8.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 unrelated patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency (PDHBD;
614111), Brown et al. (2004) identified homozygous mutations in the PDHB
gene (179060.0001-179060.0002). The patients presented with lactic
acidosis and neurologic dysfunction and had little residual PDH activity
in cultured fibroblasts. The consequences of the mutations could be
analyzed by comparison with the normal structure of the human PDH E1
enzyme.

;;N1/N2, XENOPUS, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION During mammalian spermatogenesis, testis-specific histones (see H1FT;
142712) and other testis- and sperm-specific proteins are expressed.
NASP (nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein) is a testis- and
sperm-specific histone-binding protein. O'Rand et al. (1992) cloned NASP
cDNA from a human testis cDNA library. The gene encodes a 787-amino acid
polypeptide with a predicted mass of 85 kD. The protein sequence is 53%
identical to that of the Xenopus ortholog, and 85% identical to that of
the rabbit ortholog when the N terminal of the rabbit sequence is
aligned with amino acid 101 of the human sequence. Two histone-binding
domains are strongly conserved. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3.2 kb
mRNA. Immunolocalization experiments demonstrated that in the testis,
NASP is found primarily in the cytoplasm of primary spermatocytes and
around or within the nuclei of spermatids. NASP is present near the
acrosomal region in mature human sperm.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By microarray analysis to identify genes upregulated in colorectal
carcinomas, followed by database analysis, Yuki et al. (2004) identified
LEMD1. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.7-kb LEMD1 transcript
expressed in testis only. RT-PCR revealed 6 alternatively spliced LEMD1
transcripts in testis. The longest deduced protein, LEMD1A, contains 181
amino acids and has an N-terminal LEM domain. Of the 6 LEMD1 variants,
LEMD1B, which encodes a deduced 29-amino acid protein lacking the LEM
domain, showed highest expression in testis. LEMD1F, which encodes a
67-amino acid protein containing the N-terminal LEM domain, was detected
in 17 of 18 colon cancer tissues examined. Epitope-tagged LEMD1F was
expressed in transfected COS-7 cells at the nuclear membrane and
colocalized with transfected BAF (BANF1; 603811).

GENE STRUCTURE

Yuki et al. (2004) determined that the LEMD1 gene contains 6 exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the LEMD1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP RH92566).

;;SPECKLED, 140-KD;;
LYMPHOID-RESTRICTED SP100 HOMOLOG; LYSP100
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By subtractive hybridization for cDNAs enriched in a Raji Burkitt
lymphoma (113970) cell line cDNA library, followed by screening Raji and
HeLa cell cDNA libraries, Dent et al. (1996) cloned splice variants of
SP140, which they designated LYSP100A and LYSP100B. LYSP100A encodes a
deduced 412-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 46
kD, and LYSP100B encodes a deduced 882-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 100 kD. The N-terminal 353 amino acids of
LYSP100A and LYSP100B are identical, and the N-terminal 158 amino acids
of both proteins share 61% amino acid homology with the N-terminal
region of SP100 (604585). LYSP100B has a C-terminal PHD domain and a
bromodomain. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of 0.9, 1.6,
and 3.0 kb in spleen, thymus, and tonsil, but not in brain, liver, and
muscle. LYSP100 expression was detected in all mature B-lymphocyte and
plasma cell lines tested, as well as in some T-lymphocyte cell lines,
but not in nonlymphoid cell lines. Western blot analysis detected
LYSP100 isoforms ranging in size from 65 to 150 kD. Using confocal
microscopy and electron microscopy, Dent et al. (1996) localized LYSP100
to subnuclear structures morphologically and spatially distinct from
nuclear bodies containing PML (102578).

By screening a hepatocarcinoma cDNA expression library using
autoantibodies in serum from a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis
(PBC; 109720), followed by screening hepatocarcinoma and umbilical vein
endothelial cell cDNA libraries, Bloch et al. (1996) cloned SP140. The
deduced protein contains 753 amino acids. The N terminus of SP140,
between amino acids 29 and 157, is 49% identical to a corresponding
N-terminal region of SP100. The C terminus of SP140 contains a
cysteine-rich zinc finger motif and a bromodomain. SP140 also has a
central nuclear localization signal. RNA dot blot analysis detected high
SP140 expression in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes, with much
lower levels in thymus, prostate, ovary, small intestine, and colon;
other tissues showed little to no expression. Low expression of a
smaller transcript was also observed. Western blot analysis with PBC
autoantibodies detected SP140 at an apparent molecular mass of 140 kD
following in vitro transcription and translation. Immunohistochemistry
demonstrated that SP140 colocalized with PML in dense nuclear bodies in
activated myeloid precursor cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Bloch et al. (1996) found that expression of SP140 increased in myeloid
precursor cell lines following activation with phorbol ester, dimethyl
sulfoxide, or all-trans retinoic acid. Expression was also enhanced by
treatment of cells with gamma-interferon (147570).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SP140
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP SHGC-34902).

176875	TITLE *176875 PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, CATALYTIC SUBUNIT, ALPHA ISOFORM; PPP1CA
;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, ALPHA SUBUNIT; PPP1A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein phosphorylation, a crucial posttranslational modification that
controls many diverse cellular functions, is dependent on the opposing
actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Protein
phosphatase-1 (PP1) is 1 of 4 major protein phosphatases identified in
the cytosol of eukaryotic cells that are responsible for the
dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in proteins. Although
all 4 protein phosphatases have overlapping substrate specificities in
vitro, they can be distinguished by the use of inhibitor proteins and by
their dependence on metal ions. PP1 is inhibited by nanomolar
concentrations of 2 thermostable proteins, inhibitor-1 (PPP1R1A; 613246)
and inhibitor-2 (PPP1R2; 601792), whereas the other 3 phosphatases (see
PPP2CA; 176915) are unaffected by these inhibitors. PPP1CA encodes a
catalytic subunit of PP1 that forms heterodimers with various PP1
regulatory subunits (e.g., PPP1R3A; 600917). These regulatory subunits
target PP1 to particular subcellular locations and selectively enhance
its activity toward certain substrates (Cohen and Cohen, 1989).

CLONING

Barker et al. (1990) isolated a cDNA encoding 1 isoform (PP1-alpha) of
the catalytic subunit of human protein phosphatase-1.

Using 2 regions conserved within PP1 genes, Song et al. (1993) amplified
a partial PPP1CA sequence by PCR, and they screened a cDNA library using
this product to obtain a full-length clone. The deduced 330-amino acid
protein shows complete concordance with the rabbit protein. Northern
blot analysis revealed 1.6-kb transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Genoux et al. (2002) demonstrated that PP1 determined the efficacy of
learning and memory by limiting acquisition and favoring memory decline.
When PP1 is genetically inhibited during learning, short intervals
between training episodes are sufficient for optimal performance.
Enhanced learning correlates with increased phosphorylation of CREB
(123810), of CAMKII (114078), and of the GLUR1 subunit of the AMPA
receptor (138248); it also correlates with CREB-dependent gene
expression that, in control mice, occurs only with widely distributed
training. Inhibition to PP1 prolongs memory when induced after learning,
suggesting that PP1 also promotes forgetting. Genoux et al. (2002)
suggested that this property may account for age-related cognitive
decay, as old mutant mice had preserved memory. They concluded that
their findings emphasized the physiologic importance of PP1 as a
suppressor of learning and memory, and as a potential mediator of
cognitive decline during aging.

Danial et al. (2003) undertook a proteomic analysis to assess whether
BAD (603167) might participate in mitochondrial physiology. In liver
mitochondria, BAD resides in a functional holoenzyme complex together
with protein kinase A (see 176911) and PP1 catalytic units, WAVE1
(605035) as an A kinase-anchoring protein, and glucokinase (138079).
Using mitochondria from hepatocytes of Bad-deficient mice, Danial et al.
(2003) demonstrated that BAD is required to assemble the complex, the
lack of which results in diminished mitochondria-based glucokinase
activity and blunted mitochondrial respiration in response to glucose.
Glucose deprivation results in dephosphorylation of BAD, and
BAD-dependent cell death.

In CT26 mouse colon cancer cells, Obeid et al. (2007) demonstrated that
anthracyclins induced immunogenic cell death by way of a rapid,
preapoptotic translocation of calreticulin (CALR; 109091) to the cell
surface. Anthracyclin-induced Calr translocation was mimicked by
inhibition of the Ppp1ca/Gadd34 (PPP1R15A; 611048) complex.
Administration of recombinant Calr or inhibitors of Ppp1ca/Gadd34
restored the immunogenicity of cell death elicited by etoposide and
mitomycin C and enhanced their antitumor effects in vivo.

Novoyatleva et al. (2008) identified a consensus PP1-binding motif,
RVxF, in the RNA recognition motifs of several splicing factors,
including TRA2-beta (SFRS10; 602719), SF2/ASF (SFRS1; 600812), and
SRp30c (SFRS9; 601943). PP1 bound directly to this motif in TRA2-beta
and dephosphorylated the protein, altering its interaction with other
proteins. Reducing PP1 activity promoted usage of numerous alternative
exons, including the inclusion of the SMN2 (601627) exon 7 in mice
expressing the human gene. Novoyatleva et al. (2008) concluded that PP1
has a role in splice site selection.

By immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis of PP1 complexes
in HEK293 cells, Lee et al. (2010) identified a complex containing PNUTS
(PPP1R10; 603771), TOX4 (614032), WDR82 (611059), and any 1 of the 3 PP1
catalytic subunits, PP1-alpha, PP1-beta (PPP1CB; 600590), or PP1-gamma
(PPP1CC; 176914). The complex, which they called PTW/PP1, had an
apparent molecular mass of about 200 kD, suggesting that it contains 1
molecule of each subunit. Mutation analysis revealed that human
PP1-alpha interacted with the RVxF motif of mouse Pnuts. PP1-alpha did
not interact directly with human TOX4 and WDR82. The PTW/PP1 complex
efficiently dephosphorylated the isolated C-terminal domain of the large
subunit of mouse RNA polymerase II (POLR2A; 180660) in vitro. The
PTW/PP1 complex was stable throughout the cell cycle in HEK293 cells,
but its association with chromatin was regulated. PTW/PP1 associated
with chromatin during interphase, was excluded from condensed
chromosomes during early mitosis, and was reloaded onto chromosomes at
late telophase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Terrak et al. (2004) demonstrated the crystal structure at 2.7-angstrom
resolution of the complex between PP1 and a 34-kD N-terminal domain of
the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit MYPT1 (602021). MYPT1 is the
protein that regulates PP1 function in smooth muscle relaxation.
Structural elements amino- and carboxy-terminal to the RVXF motif of
MYPT1 are positioned in a way that leads to a pronounced reshaping of
the catalytic cleft of PP1, contributing to the increased myosin
specificity of this complex. Terrak et al. (2004) concluded that the
structure has general implications for the control of PP1 activity by
other regulatory subunits.

MAPPING

Barker et al. (1990) mapped the PPP1A gene to 11q13 by Southern analysis
of somatic cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization. Because of
evidence that PP1-alpha is a tumor suppressor and because of the
assignment to 11q13, PPP1A is a candidate gene for type I multiple
endocrine neoplasia (131100), which maps to the same area.
Translocations involving breakpoints at 11q13 have been observed in
lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia of the B-cell type (see 151400),
and multiple myeloma. Other oncogenes or suppressors mapping to 11q13
include HST (164980), INT2 (164950), SEA (165110), and ST3 (191181).

Richard et al. (1991) described a high resolution radiation hybrid map
of 11q12-q13, which placed the PPP1A locus at the extreme end of a
cluster of more than 12 genes with C1NH (606860) at the other end and
with GST3 (134660) as its closest neighbor in the linear array. Using
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Saadat et al. (1995) mapped PPP1CA
to human 11q13, rat 1q43, and mouse 7E3-F2. The results indicated that
PPP1CA is a member of a group of genes showing homology of synteny.

ANIMAL MODEL

Carr et al. (2002) noted that increased PP1 activity has been observed
in end-stage human heart failure. They developed a mouse model for
cardiac tissue-specific overexpression of PP1 by introducing PPP1CA
inserted downstream of the mouse alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter.
Overexpression of PP1 was associated with depressed cardiac function,
dilated cardiomyopathy, and premature mortality, consistent with heart
failure. Knockout of Ipp1 was associated with moderate increases in PP1
activity and impaired beta-adrenergic contractile responses. Expression
of constitutively active IPP1 in failing human myocytes in culture was
associated with rescue of beta-adrenergic responsiveness.

605341	TITLE *605341 PAIRED IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE TYPE 2 RECEPTOR, ALPHA; PILRA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using an SHP1 (176883) mutant as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a
mammary gland cDNA library, followed by 5-prime RACE, Mousseau et al.
(2000) identified a cDNA encoding PILRA (paired immunoglobulin-like
receptor-alpha). Sequence analysis predicted that the 303-amino acid
PILRA protein does not contain an Ig domain per se, but does contain an
Ig-like cysteine-based motif involved in intradomain disulfide bonding.
PILRA also has a potential N-glycosylation site; numerous
O-glycosylation sites; a transmembrane domain; and 3 potential tyrosine
phosphorylation sites, 2 of which are within an immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). When expressed in a kidney cell
line, immunoblot and BIAcore analysis showed that the approximately
50-kD PILRA glycoprotein was tyrosine-phosphorylated and coprecipitated
with SHP1 through a C-terminal tyrosine. Northern blot analysis revealed
strong expression of a 1.4-kb transcript in peripheral blood leukocytes,
with lower signals in lung, spleen, and placenta as well as in 2 B-cell
lines. RT-PCR analysis indicated that PILRA and PILRB (605342) are
expressed, or paired, at the mRNA level in various tissues. Mousseau et
al. (2000) concluded that PILRA and PILRB represent a novel
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-bearing and
non-ITIM-bearing receptor pair.

By random sequencing of an activated monocyte cDNA library, Fournier et
al. (2000) cloned PILRA, which they termed FDF03. RT-PCR analysis
identified 2 splice variants lacking transmembrane domains and
presumably encoding soluble proteins. RT-PCR and flow cytometry analysis
demonstrated expression of PILRA in peripheral blood-derived monocytes,
granulocytes, and particularly dendritic cells, but not in lymphocytes.
Western blot analysis of a monocyte cell line expressing PILRA suggested
that PILRA recruits SHP2 (PTPN11; 176876) more efficiently than it
recruits SHP1, whereas LAIR1 (602992), which is also an inhibitory
molecule, recruits both molecules equivalently. In contrast to LAIR1,
crosslinking of PILRA did not inhibit the differentiation of monocytes
into dendritic cells in the presence of GMCSF (CSF2; 138960).

GENE FUNCTION

Satoh et al. (2008) noted that herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection
requires viral glycoprotein B (gB). Using flow cytometric,
immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence microscopy analyses, they showed
that PILRA associated with gB and that cells transduced with PILRA
became susceptible to HSV-1 infection. Infection of cells expressing
both PILRA and HVEM (TNFRSF14; 602746), a receptor for HSV-1 gD, could
be blocked with antibody to either receptor, indicating that cellular
receptors for both gB and gD are required for HSV-1 infection. Satoh et
al. (2008) concluded that PILRA is a coreceptor for HSV-1 infection that
associates with gB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Mousseau et al. (2000) determined that the PILRA gene contains 7 exons
and spans approximately 26.7 kb.

MAPPING

By long-range PCR on genomic DNA and comparison to a chromosome 7
segment (GenBank GENBANK RG161A02), Mousseau et al. (2000) mapped the
PILRA gene to chromosome 7, 5.6 kb downstream from PILRB. Using
radiation hybrid analysis, Fournier et al. (2000) mapped the PILRA gene
to 7q22, a localization distinct from inhibitory receptor gene families
such as LIR (e.g., LILRB1; 604811) on chromosome 19 and the natural
killer cell receptors (e.g., KLRG1; 604874) on chromosome 12. The
localization of PILRA is close, however, to a region associated with
chromosomal abnormalities in the myelodysplastic syndrome and acute
myeloid leukemia.

605988	TITLE *605988 DNA CROSS-LINK REPAIR PROTEIN 1C; DCLRE1C
;;ARTEMIS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The V(D)J recombination process insures the somatic diversification of
immunoglobulin-encoding and antigen T-cell receptor-encoding genes. This
reaction is initiated by a DNA double-strand break, which is resolved by
the ubiquitously expressed DNA repair machinery. Human T-B severe
combined immunodeficiency associated with increased cellular
radiosensitivity (RS-SCID; 602450) is characterized by a defect in V(D)J
recombination leading to an early arrest of both B- and T-cell
maturation. The RS-SCID locus maps to the short arm of chromosome 10. By
analyzing chromosome 10 BAC contigs, searching sequence databases, and
RT-PCR, Moshous et al. (2001) isolated a cDNA encoding Artemis, a
protein involved in V(D)J recombination/DNA repair. The predicted
685-amino acid Artemis protein has a molecular mass of 77.6 kD and is
78% identical to the murine protein. Protein sequence analysis suggested
that Artemis belongs to the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily. Northern
blot and RT-PCR analyses detected ubiquitous expression of Artemis.

By RT-PCR and 5-prime RACE, Li et al. (2002) determined that alternative
splicing is found with exons 2, 2b, 2c, 3b, and 5 of the Artemis gene,
resulting in at least 6 alternative transcripts in addition to the
primary transcript. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated nuclear
localization of Artemis.

GENE FUNCTION

Ma et al. (2002) reported that Artemis forms a complex with the 469-kD
DNA-dependent protein kinase (PRKDC; 600899) in the absence of DNA. The
purified Artemis protein alone possesses single-strand-specific
5-prime-to-3-prime exonuclease activity. Upon complex formation, PRKDC
phosphorylates Artemis, and Artemis acquires endonucleolytic activity on
5-prime and 3-prime overhangs, as well as hairpins. The Artemis-PRKDS
complex can open hairpins generated by the RAG (see 179615) complex.
Thus, PRKDC regulates Artemis by both phosphorylation and complex
formation to permit enzymatic activities that are critical for the
hairpin-opening step of V(D)J recombination and for the 5-prime and
3-prime overhang processing in nonhomologous DNA end joining.

Moshous et al. (2003) presented evidence suggesting that Artemis also
acts as a 'caretaker' gene and is involved in genomic stability.

Lu et al. (2008) reported that the kinase activity of the Artemis:PRKDC
complex could be activated by hairpin DNA ends in cis, allowing nicking
of hairpins, followed by processing and joining by nonhomologous DNA end
joining. These insights enabled reconstitution of many aspects of
antigen receptor diversification of V(D)J recombination using 13 highly
purified polypeptides, thereby permitting variable domain exon assembly.
The features of the recombination sites created by this biochemical
system included all of the features observed in vivo, such as
nucleolytic resection, P nucleotides, and N nucleotide addition, and
indicated that most, if not all, of the end modification enzymes had
been identified.

To investigate the role of Artemis in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)
during class switch recombination (CSR), Du et al. (2008) characterized
the switch (S) recombinational junctions of Artemis-deficient human B
cells. They found that S(mu)-to-S(alpha) junctions could be amplified,
whereas S(mu)-to-S(gamma) junctions usually could not be amplified. Du
et al. (2008) concluded that impaired Artemis function results in
varying modes of CSR junction resolution for different S regions and
that Artemis is linked to the predominant NHEJ pathway during CSR.

Rivera-Munoz et al. (2009) found that mice conditionally lacking Artemis
in mature B cells exhibited reduced class switching to certain Ig
isotypes and increased DNA microhomology usage at CSR junctions.
Increased DNA microhomology usage was also found in CSR junctions of
RS-SCID patients harboring hypomorphic Artemis mutations. Rivera-Munoz
et al. (2009) concluded that Artemis participates in the repair of a
subset of DNA breaks generated during CSR.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Moshous et al. (2001) determined that the
Artemis gene contains 14 exons that range in size from 52 to 1,160 bp.

MAPPING

By BAC contig analysis, Moshous et al. (2001) mapped the Artemis gene to
chromosome 10p.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Moshous et al. (2001) identified 8 different mutations in the Artemis
gene in 13 patients from 11 families with RS-SCID.

Li et al. (2002) identified a founder mutation in exon 8 of the Artemis
gene (605988.0009) in 21 Native Americans with Athabascan-type severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCIDA; 602450). Wildtype Artemis could
complement the defective coding joint and reduced signal joint formation
in SCIDA fibroblasts.

Noordzij et al. (2003) identified 4 patients with RS-SCID on the basis
of Artemis gene mutations. One patient had a large genomic deletion, but
the other 3 carried simple missense mutations in conserved amino acid
residues in the SNM1 homology domain of the Artemis protein. The cells
containing the missense mutations had the same recombination phenotype
as the cells with the large deletion, indicating that these amino acid
residues are indispensable for Artemis function. Noordzij et al. (2003)
performed studies that demonstrated a complete B-cell differentiation
arrest at the pre-B-cell receptor checkpoint in bone marrow. The
completeness of this arrest illustrated the importance of Artemis at
this stage of lymphoid differentiation.

In 4 patients from 2 families with partial SCID, Moshous et al. (2003)
identified hypomorphic mutations in exon 14 of the Artemis gene
(605988.0010; 605988.0011). Both mutations spared the
metallo-beta-lactamase catalytic domain of the protein, resulting in
residual function. Two of the patients developed B-cell lymphoma, and
the authors suggested that Artemis also functions as a 'caretaker' gene,
responsible for genomic stability.

In a patient with Omenn syndrome (603554), Ege et al. (2005) identified
compound heterozygosity for hypomorphic Artemis mutations (605998.0012;
605988.0013). The patient's T cells expressed alpha/beta receptors with
an oligoclonal repertoire but normal V(D)J recombination coding joints.
Sequencing of the Artemis gene revealed compound heterozygosity in the
nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) factor encoded by the Artemis gene,
explaining the enhanced radiosensitivity of the patient's primary dermal
fibroblasts. The maternal allele contained a null mutation with the
active center, whereas the expression of the paternal allele with a
mutation in the start codon partially restored V(D)J recombination and
Artemis function in vivo and in vitro.

About 60% of DCLRE1C and IGHM (147020) gene defects involve gross
deletions, compared with about 6% of BTK (300300) gene defects. Van Zelm
et al. (2008) compared gross deletion breakpoints involving DCLRE1C,
IGHM, and BTK to identify mechanisms underlying these differences in
gross deletion frequencies. Their analysis suggested that gross
deletions involve transposable elements or large homologous regions
rather than recombination motifs. Van Zelm et al. (2008) hypothesized
that the transposable element content of a gene is related to its gross
deletion frequency.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rooney et al. (2002) reported that Artemis-deficient mice had an overall
phenotype similar to that of Prkdc-deficient mice, including severe
combined immunodeficiency associated with defects in opening and joining
V(D)J-coding hairpin ends and increased cellular ionizing radiation
sensitivity. While these findings supported the notion that Artemis
functions with PRKDC in a subset of nonhomologous DNA end-joining
functions, differences between Artemis- and Prkdc-deficient phenotypes,
most notably decreased fidelity of V(D)J signal sequence joining in
Prkdc-deficient but not Artemis-deficient fibroblasts, suggested
additional functions for PRKDC. Artemis deficiency led to chromosomal
instability in fibroblasts, demonstrating that Artemis functions as a
genomic caretaker.

Li et al. (2005) generated mice lacking Artemis and confirmed the
findings of Rooney et al. (2002). Hemopoietic stem cell transplants in
Artemis-deficient mice resulted in discordant reconstitution with a
preference for the T-cell compartment, similar to observations in
children with SCIDA.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION
DCLRE1C, ARG74TER

In 3 unrelated patients with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 279 of the Artemis gene,
resulting in an arg74-to-ter (R74X) substitution. Patient P2 was
homozygous for R74X, while patients P1 and P4 were compound heterozygous
for R74X and a genomic deletion of exons 1 to 4 (605988.0002) and an
exon 10 splice donor site mutation (605988.0005), respectively.

DCLRE1C, EX1-4DEL

In 4 unrelated patients with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a deletion of exons 1 to 4 of the Artemis gene, resulting in
a complete absence of Artemis transcript. Patients P6, P15, and P40 were
homozygous for the mutation, while patient P1 was compound heterozygous
for the deletion of exons 1 to 4 and an arg74-to-ter substitution
(605988.0001).

SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION
DCLRE1C, EX5-6DEL

In a patient (P3) with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a deletion of exons 5 to 6 of the Artemis gene, resulting in
the out-of-frame splicing of exons 4 to 7 and a frameshift at lys96. The
patient was compound heterozygous for this mutation and an exon 11
splice donor site mutation (605988.0004).

DCLRE1C, IVS11DS, G-C, +1

In a patient (P3) with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a splicing mutation (G to C) in the first nucleotide of the
donor consensus sequence of intron 11 of the Artemis gene, resulting in
an out-of-frame splicing of exons 10 to 12 and a frameshift at thr300.
The patient was compound heterozygous for this mutation and a deletion
of exons 5 to 6 (605988.0003).

DCLRE1C, IVS10DS, G-A, +1

In a patient (P4) with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a splicing mutation (G to A) in the first nucleotide of the
donor consensus sequence of intron 10 of the Artemis gene, resulting in
an in-frame splicing of exons 9 to 12 and potentially leading to a
protein that lacks ala261 to glu317. The patient was compound
heterozygous for this mutation and an arg74-to-ter substitution
(605988.0001).

.0006
SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY WITH SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION
DCLRE1C, IVS5DS, G-T, +1

In 4 patients (P5, P11, P12, and P38) from 2 families with RS-SCID
(602450), Moshous et al. (2001) identified a splicing mutation (G to T)
in the first nucleotide of the donor consensus sequence of intron 5 of
the Artemis gene, resulting in an out-of-frame splicing of exons 4 to 6
and a frameshift at lys96. The patients were homozygous for this
mutation.

In a patient (P16) with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a 1-bp deletion (G) at nucleotide 818 in exon 9 of the
Artemis gene, resulting in a frameshift after codon ala254. The patient
was homozygous.

DCLRE1C, EX5-8DEL

In a patient (P47) with RS-SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2001)
identified a deletion of exons 5 to 8 of the Artemis gene, resulting in
an in-frame splicing of exons 4 to 9 and potentially leading to a

SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY, ATHABASCAN-TYPE
DCLRE1C, TYR192TER

Li et al. (2002) identified a homozygous C-to-A transversion in exon 8
of the DCLRE1C gene in 17 of 18 Navajo and 3 of 3 Apache patients with
Athabascan-type severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIDA; 602450). The
mutation truncated the Artemis protein at tyr192 (Y192X) and created an
NspI restriction enzyme site in exon 8 of the gene, leading to a simple
assay to confirm the mutation and the heterozygous status for patients
and carriers. Li et al. (2002) estimated that the Y192X mutation is
carried by 2.1% of Navajo and Apache (Athabascan-speaking) Native
Americans.

SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY, PARTIAL
DCLRE1C, 7-BP DEL

In 3 sibs with partial SCID (602450), 2 of whom developed B-cell
lymphomas, Moshous et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for
2 mutations in the Artemis gene: a 7-bp deletion (1384-1390) in exon 14,
resulting in a premature stop codon 10 amino acids downstream, and a
null mutation (605988.0002). The 7-bp deletion in exon 14 spared the
metallo-beta-lactamase catalytic region of the protein, and functional
expression studies showed that the mutant protein retained residual
activity. All patients had decreased levels of polyclonal T and B cells,
indicating that a low level of V(D)J recombination had occurred.

SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY, PARTIAL
DCLRE1C, 17-BP DEL

In a patient with partial SCID (602450), Moshous et al. (2003)
identified a homozygous 17-bp deletion in exon 14 of the Artemis gene,
resulting in a premature stop codon 15 amino acids downstream. The
deletion spared the metallo-beta-lactamase catalytic region of the
protein, predicting residual functional activity.

.0012
OMENN SYNDROME
DCLRE1C, MET1THR

In a 5-month-old male infant with Omenn syndrome (603554), Ege et al.
(2005) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the Artemis
gene: inherited from his father, a T-to-C transition, resulting in a
met1-to-thr substitution (M1T), and a C-to-G transversion, resulting in
a his35-to-asp substitution (H35D; 605988.0013), inherited from his
mother. The maternal H35D allele contained a null mutation within the
active center of the protein, whereas expression of the paternal M1T
allele with a start codon mutation partially restored V(D)J
recombination and Artemis function in vivo and vitro. The healthy
nonconsanguineous parents had 2 older sons who both died with
manifestations consistent with Omenn syndrome. The eldest son presented
with erythrodermatitis and died at the age of 11 months of atypical
pneumonia. The second son died at the age of 5 years of aspergillosis
(see 614079). He suffered from thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic
anemia, which were considered to represent Evans syndrome. The deceased
second brother had the same compound heterozygous mutations as were
found in the proband.

107266	TITLE *107266 CD22 ANTIGEN; CD22
;;B-CELL ANTIGEN CD22;;
SIALIC ACID-BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE LECTIN 2; SIGLEC2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The human B-lymphocyte-restricted antigen CD22 is expressed early in
B-cell development in pro-B cells, as a cytoplasmic protein, and later
in B-cell development, at the late pre-B-cell stage, as a cell surface
protein. Once expressed as a membrane protein, CD22 persists on B cells
until they differentiate into plasma cells. The presence of cytoplasmic
CD22 is a useful marker for B-cell precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia.
CD22 appears to be a heterodimer consisting of 130- and 140-kD
glycoproteins with protein cores of 80 and 100 kD, respectively. The 2
subunits are thought to be independently transported to the surface and
originate from 2 separate precursor molecules. Studies of the structure
of the 2 proteins and cDNA cloning suggested that the 2 proteins arise
from differential RNA processing of the same gene, with the larger
subunit being composed of an extracellular portion of 7 immunoglobulin
domains, 1 V-like and 6 C-like, and a smaller subunit of 5 Ig domains, 1
V-like and 4 C-like. The CD22 polypeptide is structurally related to
myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG; 159460), neural cell adhesion
molecule (NCAM; 116930), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; 114890).
Consistent with the structural similarities to the adhesion molecules,
CD22 participates in adhesion between B cells and other cell types.
Wilson et al. (1991) cloned a full-length cDNA corresponding to the
B-cell membrane protein CD22.

GENE FUNCTION

Nonhuman mammalian cells express N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Human cells contain only Neu5Ac
because of an exon deletion/frameshift mutation in cytidine
monophospho-sialic acid hydroxylase (CMAH; 603209), which converts
Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins, or
SIGLECs, such as CD22 (SIGLEC2), recognize sialic acids. Brinkman-Van
der Linden et al. (2000) showed that human SIGLEC1 (SN; 600751) strongly
prefers Neu5Ac over Neu5Gc. Sequence analysis of SIGLEC2 cDNA found that
while the chimpanzee sequence is 97% homologous to human, bonobo and
gorilla are only 96% homologous, and the orangutan is only 93%
homologous. Using regions of SIGLEC2 proteins from mouse, chimpanzee,
orangutan, and human fused to the Fc region of human IgG, and flow
cytometry analysis, Brinkman-Van der Linden et al. (2000) showed that
all bound well to chimpanzee Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B
cells, which expressed high levels of Neu5Gc. Except for mouse, all
bound well to human EBV-transformed B cells, which expressed high levels
of Neu5Ac.

In a review of immune inhibitory receptors, Ravetch and Lanier (2000)
pointed out that autoimmune disorders may result from the disruption of
inhibitory receptors, particularly in their conserved intracellular
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs). ITIMs are sites
for alternative phosphorylation, typically by a Src kinase, and
dephosphorylation, either by the tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 (176883) or
the inositol phosphatase SHIP (601582), transducing signals to distinct
pathways. Ravetch and Lanier (2000) noted that CD22 has ITIMs that
interact with SHP1 and oppose activation mediated by the B cell
receptor.

Using murine B-cell lines, Wakabayashi et al. (2002) demonstrated that
CD22 downmodulates signaling through the IgM and IgD B-cell receptors
(BCRs), but not through the IgG BCR, because the IgG cytoplasmic tail
prevents CD22 phosphorylation and actually enhances IgG-BCR signaling.
Wakabayashi et al. (2002) proposed that enhanced IgG-BCR signaling may
be involved in efficient IgG production, which is crucial for protective
immunity against pathogens.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and coprecipitation analyses, John et al. (2003)
found that tyr843 or tyr863 in the cytoplasmic tail of CD22 interacted
with AP50 (AP2M1; 601024), the medium chain subunit of the AP2 complex.
Studies on B cells showed that internalization of CD22 was dependent on
its association with the AP2 complex via tyrosine-based internalization
motifs.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wilson et al. (1993) used a nearly full-length cDNA clone of CD22 to
isolate genomic clones that spanned the gene. The gene covers 22 kb of
DNA and comprises 15 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Wilson et al. (1993) showed that
the CD22 locus is located within band 19q13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

O'Keefe et al. (1996) made observations in mice with a targeted
disruption of the CD22 gene indicating that CD22 is a negative regulator
of antigen receptor signaling whose onset of expression at the mature B
cell stage may serve to raise the antigen concentration threshold
required for B cell triggering. Splenic B cells from CD22 knockout mice
were found to be hyperresponsive to receptor signaling. Heightened
calcium fluxes and cell proliferation were obtained at lower ligand
concentrations. The mice gave augmented immune response, had an expanded
peritoneal B-1 cell population, and contained increased serum titers of
autoantibody.

Chen et al. (2004) expressed mouse Cd22 in mouse and chicken B-cell
lines devoid of Cd22 and examined B cells from mice deficient in Cd22 or
Pmca4 (108732). They identified an activation-dependent interaction
between phosphorylated Cd22 and Pmca4 and found that Cd22 together with
Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883) provided negative control of B-cell activation by
enhancing Pmca4-mediated calcium efflux after B-cell receptor
stimulation.

102574	TITLE +102574 ACTININ, ALPHA-3; ACTN3
ACTN3 DEFICIENCY, INCLUDED;;
SPRINTING PERFORMANCE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Alpha-actinin is an actin-binding protein with multiple roles in
different cell types. In nonmuscle cells, the cytoskeletal isoform is
found along microfilament bundles and adherens-type junctions, where it
is involved in binding actin to the membrane (see ACTN1; 102575). In
contrast, skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle isoforms are localized to
the Z disc and analogous dense bodies, where they help anchor the
myofibrillar actin filaments. Beggs et al. (1992) characterized 2 human
muscle-specific alpha-actinin genes, ACTN2 (102573) and ACTN3. The
deduced 901-amino acid ACTN3 protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 103 kD. ACTN3 has an N-terminal actin-binding domain of about 250
amino acids, followed by 4 central repeats and 2 EF-hand motifs near the
C terminus. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected Actn3
expression in skeletal muscle, but not in heart, brain, liver, kidney,
or small intestine. ACTN3 was also detected in human fetal skeletal
muscle.

Seto et al. (2011) stated that the central repeats of ACTN3 are spectrin
(see 182860)-like repeats that form a rod domain.

MAPPING

Beggs et al. (1992) assigned the ACTN3 gene to human chromosome 11 by
use of somatic cell hybrids and narrowed the localization to chromosome
11q13-q14 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Mills et al. (2001) mapped the 4 murine actinin orthologs, which were
all located at evolutionarily conserved syntenic regions for the 4 human
genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Mills et al. (2001) demonstrated that murine Actn2 and Actn3 are
differentially expressed, spatially and temporally, during embryonic
development and that, in contrast to humans, alpha-actinin-2 expression
does not completely overlap alpha-actinin-3 in postnatal skeletal
muscle, suggesting independent function. Furthermore, sequence
comparison of human, mouse, and chicken alpha-actinin genes demonstrated
that ACTN3 has been conserved over a long period of evolutionary time,
implying a constraint on evolutionary rate imposed by continued function
of the gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

ACTN2 is expressed in all skeletal muscle fibers, whereas
alpha-actinin-3 expression is limited to a subset of type 2 (fast)
fibers. North et al. (1999) identified a common nonsense mutation in
ACTN3, arg577-to-ter (R577X; 102574.0001; dbSNP rs1815739), in the
general population in many ethnic groups. The R577X mutation had an
allele frequency ranging from 0.22 +/- 0.05 to 0.52 +/- 0.04 in ethnic
populations from Asia, the Americas, Australasia, Africa, and Europe.
Approximately 16% of the world population is predicted to have
congenital deficiency of alpha-actinin-3. No disease phenotype is
associated with this deficiency. North et al. (1999) concluded that
other factors likely compensate for the absence of alpha-actinin-3 at
the Z lines of skeletal muscle fast fibers. These results demonstrated
that ACTN3 is not an essential gene, and suggested that absence of a
structural protein caused by homozygosity for a null mutation cannot be
assumed to be disease-related without additional family and population
data.

Yang et al. (2003) demonstrated highly significant associations between
ACTN3 genotype and athletic performance. Both male and female elite
sprint athletes had significantly higher frequencies of the 577R allele
than did controls. This suggested that the presence of alpha-actinin-3
has a beneficial effect on the function of skeletal muscle in generating
forceful contractions at high velocity, and provides an evolutionary
advantage because of increased sprint performance. There is also a
genotype effect in female sprint and endurance athletes, with higher
than expected numbers of R577X heterozygotes among sprint athletes and
lower than expected numbers among endurance athletes. The lack of a
similar effect in males suggested that the ACTN3 genotype affects
athletic performance differently in males and females. The differential
effects in sprint and endurance athletes suggested that the R577X
polymorphism may have been maintained in the human population by
balancing natural selection. It is likely that there is a 'trade off'
between sprint and endurance traits that imposes important constraints
on the evolution of physical performance in humans and other vertebrates
(Garland et al., 1990). This hypothesis is supported by data from
world-class decathletes, which demonstrated that performance in the
100-meter sprint, shot put, long jump, and 110-meter hurdles (which rely
on explosive power and fast fatigue-susceptible muscle fibers) is
negatively correlated with performance in the 1,500-meter race (which
requires endurance and fatigue-resistant slow fiber activity) (Van Damme
et al., 2002).

ANIMAL MODEL

MacArthur et al. (2008) found that muscle from Actn3-knockout mice
displayed reduced force generation, reduced fast fiber diameter,
increased activity of multiple enzymes in the aerobic metabolic pathway,
altered contractile properties, and enhanced recovery from fatigue.
MacArthur et al. (2008) concluded that null mutation of ACTN3, such as
R577X, shifts the properties of fast fibers toward those characteristic
of slow fibers.

Quinlan et al. (2010) demonstrated a link between alpha-actinin-3 and
glycogen metabolism. Actn3 knockout mice had higher muscle glycogen
content and a 50% reduction in the activity of glycogen phosphorylase,
GPh (PYGM; 608455). The reduction in enzyme activity was accompanied by
altered posttranslational modification of GPh, suggesting that
alpha-actinin-3 may regulate GPh activity by altering its level of
phosphorylation. Quinlan et al. (2010) proposed that the changes in
glycogen metabolism underlie the downstream metabolic consequences of
alpha-actinin-3 deficiency.

Seto et al. (2011) found that, compared with wildtype, Actn3 -/- mouse
extensor digitorum longus muscle generated significantly reduced force
and was susceptible to contraction-induced damage during eccentric
contraction when stretched 30% above optimal length. Damage in Actn3 -/-
muscle was accompanied by upregulation of genes involved in muscle
regeneration. Expression of Actn2 was upregulated in Actn3 -/- muscle
such that the total sarcomeric content of alpha-actinin was unchanged.
The Z-disc proteins Zasp (LDB3; 605906), titin (TTN; 188840), and
vinculin (VCL; 193065) bound more avidly to Actn2 than to Actn3,
suggesting a biochemical basis for altered mechanics and fragility in
Actn3 -/- muscle.

ACTN3, ARG577TER (dbSNP rs1815739)

North et al. (1999) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1747
(dbSNP rs1815739) in exon 16 of the ACTN3 gene, which resulted in a stop
codon replacing the arg at residue 577 (R577X). This mutation resulted
in no protein detectable by Western blot. Sixteen percent of the world
population is predicted to be homozygous for this mutation. No disease
phenotype is associated; therefore, North et al. (1999) suggested that
the ACTN3 gene is functionally redundant in humans.

Mills et al. (2001) genotyped nonhuman primates and concluded that the
R577X null mutation most likely arose in humans.

Suminaga et al. (2000) found an allele frequency of 0.49 for the 1747C-T
polymorphism in Japanese. Although the incidence (24.2%) of congenital
deficiency of alpha-actinin-3 was high, no evidence could be found that
the homozygous state modified the dystrophinopathies Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (310200) and Becker muscular dystrophy (300376).

Yang et al. (2003) found that the R577X genotype is associated with
human elite athletic performance. Both male and female elite sprint
athletes had significantly higher frequencies of the 577R allele than
did controls. In female sprint and endurance athletes there was a higher
than expected number of R577X heterozygotes among sprint athletes and
lower than expected numbers among endurance athletes. The lack of a
similar effect in males suggested that the ACTN3 genotype affects
athletic performance differently in males and females. The differential
effects in sprint and endurance athletes suggested that the R577X
polymorphism may have been maintained in the human population by
balancing natural selection.

Niemi and Majamaa (2005) determined the ACTN3 R577X genotype in 52 elite
Finnish endurance and 89 sprint athletes and found that the frequency of
the XX genotype was higher and RR lower among the endurance athletes,
and that none of the top Finnish sprinters had the XX genotype.

The association of the R577X polymorphism with elite athlete status and
human muscle performance suggests that ACTN3 deficiency influences the
function of fast muscle fibers. MacArthur et al. (2007) showed that loss
of ACTN3 expression in a knockout mouse model resulted in a shift in
muscle metabolism toward the more efficient aerobic pathway and an
increase in intrinsic endurance performance. In addition, they
demonstrated that the genomic region surrounding the 577X null allele
shows low levels of genetic variation and recombination in individuals
of European and East Asian descent, consistent with strong, recent
positive selection. They proposed that the 577X allele has been
positively selected in some human populations owing to its effect on
skeletal muscle metabolism.

In a study of 992 Greek adolescent boys and girls, Moran et al. (2007)
found a significant association between the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism and
40 meter sprint times in males (p = 0.003) that accounts for 2.3% of
phenotypic variance, with the 577R allele contributing to faster times
in an additive fashion. The R577X polymorphism was not associated with
other predominantly strength/power-related or endurance phenotypes.

In 52 white and 23 black elite-level bodybuilders and powerlifters from
the U.S., Roth et al. (2008) found significantly lower XX genotype
frequency in strength athletes (6.7%) compared to controls (16.3%; p =
0.005). The XX genotype was significantly lower in white athletes (9.7%)
compared to white controls (19.9%; p = 0.018), but did not reach
significance in black athletes (0%) compared to black controls (4.8%; p
= 0.10). Roth et al. (2008) concluded that the 577X allele is
underrepresented in elite strength athletes in addition to sprint
athletes, consistent with previous reports indicating that ACTN3
deficiency appears to impair muscle performance.

602355	TITLE *602355 TNF RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 6; TRAF6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011) is activated by many
cytokines that signal through different cell surface receptors. Members
of the TRAF protein family have been implicated in the activation of
this transcription factor by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF; 191160)
superfamily. By database analysis and screening human cDNA libraries,
Cao et al. (1996) cloned TRAF6, a novel human TRAF. The deduced
522-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 57 kD. It has
a cysteine-rich N terminus that includes a RING finger and 5 potential
zinc fingers, followed by a TRAF-N domain and a C-terminal TRAF-C
domain. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of TRAF6
transcripts of about 2.5, 4, and 8 kb in all human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Cao et al. (1996) showed that when overexpressed in cultured human
cells, TRAF6 activates NF-kappa-B. A dominant-negative mutant of TRAF6
inhibited this activation signaled by interleukin-1 (IL1A; 147760). IL1A
treatment of the same cells induced the association of TRAF6 with
interleukin-1-associated kinase (IRAK; 300283), a serine/threonine
kinase that is rapidly recruited to the IL1A receptor after IL1A
induction. The findings were interpreted as indicating that TRAF
proteins function as signal transducers for distinct receptor families
in that TRAF6 participates in IL1A signaling.

TRANCE (or RANKL; 602642), a TNF family member, and its receptor, RANK
(603499), are critical regulators of dendritic cell and osteoclast
function. Wong et al. (1999) demonstrated that TRANCE activates the
antiapoptotic serine/threonine kinase PKB (AKT1; 164730) through a
signaling complex involving SRC (190090) and TRAF6. A deficiency in SRC
or addition of SRC family kinase inhibitors blocked TRANCE-mediated PKB
activation in osteoclasts. SRC and TRAF6 interacted with each other and
with RANK upon receptor engagement. TRAF6, in turn, enhanced the kinase
activity of SRC, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream
signaling molecules such as CBL (165360). These results defined a
mechanism by which TRANCE activates SRC family kinases and PKB, and
provided evidence of cross-talk between TRAF proteins and SRC family
kinases.

TRAF6 is a signal transducer in the NF-kappa-B pathway that activates
I-kappa-B kinase (IKK; see 600664) in response to proinflammatory
cytokines. Deng et al. (2000) purified a heterodimeric protein complex
that links TRAF6 to IKK activation. Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis
revealed that this complex, which they called TRIKA1 (TRAF6-regulated
IKK activator-1), is composed of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBC13
(603679) and the UBC-like protein UBE2V1 (602995). They found that
TRAF6, a RING domain protein, functions together with UBC13/UBE2V1 to
catalyze the synthesis of unique polyubiquitin chains linked through
lysine-63 (K63) of ubiquitin. Blockade of this polyubiquitin chain
synthesis, but not inhibition of the proteasome, prevents the activation
of IKK by TRAF6. These results unveil a new regulatory function for
ubiquitin, in which IKK is activated through the assembly of K63-linked
polyubiquitin chains.

Wang et al. (2001) determined that TRIKA2, the second factor required
for IKK activation in the presence of TRAF6 and TRIKA1, is composed of
TAK1 (602614) and its binding partners, TAB1 (602615) and TAB2 (605101).

Takayanagi et al. (2000) demonstrated that T-cell production of
interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) strongly suppresses osteoclastogenesis
by interfering with the RANKL-RANK signaling pathway. IFNG induces rapid
degradation of the RANK adaptor protein, TRAF6, resulting in strong
inhibition of the RANKL-induced activation of the transcription factor
NFKB and JNK (601158). This inhibition of osteoclastogenesis could be
rescued by overexpressing TRAF6 in precursor cells, indicating that
TRAF6 is the target critical for the IFNG action. Furthermore,
Takayanagi et al. (2000) provided evidence that the accelerated
degradation of TRAF6 requires both its ubiquitination, which is
initiated by RANKL, and IFNG-induced activation of the
ubiquitin-proteasome system. Takayanagi et al. (2000) concluded that
their study showed that there is crosstalk between the tumor necrosis
factor and IFN families of cytokines, through which IFNG provides a
negative link between T-cell activation and bone resorption.

Takatsuna et al. (2003) found that mouse Tifa (609028) bound Traf6
directly, and they presented evidence that TIFA is involved in TRAF6
activation of NFKB and JNK. Ea et al. (2004) showed that human TIFA
induced the oligomerization and polyubiquitination of TRAF6, leading to
activation of TAK1 and IKK.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Wooff et al. (2004) found that mouse Traf6
interacted with human UBC13, but not with human MMS2 (UBE2V2; 603001) or
UEV1A (UBE2V1). Mutation analysis revealed that the N-terminal RING
finger and zinc finger domains of Traf6 were necessary and sufficient
for the interaction. These domains also mediated Traf6 self-association.

Akiyama et al. (2005) demonstrated that deficiency in TRAF6 results in
disorganized distribution of medullary thymic epithelial cells (TECs)
and the absence of mature medullary TECs. Engraftment of thymic stroma
of Traf6-null embryos into athymic nude mice induced autoimmunity. Thus,
Akiyama et al. (2005) concluded that TRAF6 directs the development of
thymic stroma and represents a critical point of regulation for
self-tolerance and autoimmunity.

Bai et al. (2005) found that Fhl2 (602633) inhibited association of
Traf6 with Rank in mouse osteoclast precursors. Consequently, Fhl2
reduced Traf6-induced NF-kappa-B activity and Rank signaling, delaying
Rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis.

Bai et al. (2008) found that Traf6 interacted with the transcription
factor Runx1 (151385) in mouse osteoclast nuclei. Fhl2 increased the
nuclear abundance of Traf6 in transfected cells and interacted with
nuclear Traf6 and Runx1. Fhl2 did not interact with Runx1 in the absence
of Traf6. The Traf6-Runx1-Fhl2 complex bound Runx1 recognition sequences
in the Fhl2 promoter and induced Fhl2 expression. Traf6 also reduced
Fhl2 content via polyubiquitination of Fhl2, followed by Fhl2
proteasomal degradation.

To dissect biochemically Toll-like receptor signaling, Hacker et al.
(2006) established a system for isolating signaling complexes assembled
by dimerized adaptors. Using MyD88 (602170) as a prototypic adaptor,
they identified TRAF3 (601896) as a new component of Toll/interleukin-1
receptor signaling complexes that is recruited along with TRAF6. Using
myeloid cells from Traf3- and Traf6-deficient mice, Hacker et al. (2006)
demonstrated that TRAF3 is essential for the induction of type I
interferons and the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL10;
124092), but is dispensable for expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
In fact, Traf3-deficient cells overproduced proinflammatory cytokines
owing to defective IL10 production. Despite their structural similarity,
the functions of TRAF3 and TRAF6 are largely distinct. TRAF3 is also
recruited to the adaptor TRIF (607601) and is required for marshalling
the protein kinase TBK1 (604834) into Toll/interleukin-1 receptor
signaling complexes, thereby explaining its unique role in activation of
the interferon response.

Pearce et al. (2009) demonstrated that TRAF6 regulates CD8 (see 186910)
memory T cell development after infection by modulating fatty acid
metabolism. They showed that mice with a T cell-specific deletion of
TRAF6 mounted robust CD8 antigen-specific effector T cell responses, but
had a profound defect in their ability to generate memory T cells that
was characterized by the disappearance of antigen-specific cells in the
weeks after primary immunization. Microarray analysis revealed that
TRAF6-deficient CD8 T cells exhibited altered expression of genes that
regulate fatty acid metabolism. Consistent with this, activated CD8 T
cells lacking TRAF6 displayed defective AMP-activated kinase activation
and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in response to growth
factor withdrawal. Administration of the antidiabetic drug metformin
restored FAO and CD8 memory T cell generation in the absence of TRAF6.
This treatment also increased CD8 memory T cells in wildtype mice, and
consequently was able to considerably improve the efficacy of an
experimental anticancer vaccine.

Yang et al. (2009) found that the protein kinase Akt (164730) undergoes
lysine-63 chain ubiquitination, which is important for Akt membrane
localization and phosphorylation. TRAF6 was found to be a direct E3
ligase for Akt and was essential for Akt ubiquitination, membrane
recruitment, and phosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation. The
human cancer-associated Akt mutant (164730.0001) displayed an increase
in Akt ubiquitination, in turn contributing to the enhancement of Akt
membrane localization and phosphorylation. Thus, Yang et al. (2009)
concluded that Akt ubiquitination is an important step for oncogenic Akt
activation.

Xia et al. (2009) found that unanchored polyubiquitin chains synthesized
by TRAF6 and UBCH5C (602963) activate the IKK (see 600664) complex.
Disassembly of the polyubiquitin chains by deubiquitination enzymes
prevented TAK1 (602614) and IKK activation. Xia et al. (2009) concluded
that unanchored polyubiquitin chains directly activate TAK1 and IKK,
suggesting a new mechanism of protein kinase regulation.

Shembade et al. (2010) showed that A20 (191163) inhibits the E3 ligase
activities of TRAF6, TRAF2 (601895), and cIAP1 (601712) by antagonizing
interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBC13 (603679) and
UBCH5C. A20, together with the regulatory molecule TAX1BP1 (605326),
interacted with UBC13 and UBCH5C and triggered their ubiquitination and
proteasome-dependent degradation. These findings suggested a mechanism
of A20 action in the inhibition of inflammatory signaling pathways.

West et al. (2011) demonstrated that engagement of a subset of Toll-like
receptors (TLR1, 601194; TLR2, 603028; and TLR4, 603030) results in the
recruitment of mitochondria to macrophage phagosomes and augments
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production. This response
involves translocation of a TLR signaling adaptor, TRAF6, to
mitochondria, where it engages the protein ECSIT (608388), which is
implicated in mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly. Interaction with
TRAF6 leads to ECSIT ubiquitination and enrichment at the mitochondrial
periphery, resulting in increased mitochondrial and cellular ROS
generation. ECSIT- and TRAF6-depleted macrophages have decreased levels
of TLR-induced ROS and are significantly impaired in their ability to
kill intracellular bacteria. Additionally, reducing macrophage mROS
levels by expressing catalase (115500) in mitochondria results in
defective bacterial killing, confirming the role of mROS in bactericidal
activity. West et al. (2011) concluded that their results revealed a
novel pathway linking innate immune signaling to mitochondria,
implicated mROS as an important component of antibacterial responses,
and further established mitochondria as hubs for innate immune
signaling.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Ye et al. (2002) reported the crystal structures of TRAF6, alone and in
complex with TRAF6-binding peptides from CD40 and TRANCER (RANK),
members of the TNFR superfamily, to gain insight into the mechanism by
which TRAF6 mediates several signaling cascades. A 40-degree difference
in the directions of the bound peptides in TRAF6 and TRAF2 showed that
there are marked structural differences between receptor recognition by
TRAF6 and other TRAFs. The structural determinant of the peptide-TRAF6
interaction revealed a Pro-X-Glu-X-X-(aromatic/acidic residue)
TRAF6-binding motif, which is present not only in CD40 and RANK but also
in the 3 IRAK adaptor kinases for IL1R/Toll-like receptor signaling (see
604459). Cell-permeable peptides with the TRAF6-binding motif inhibited
TRAF6 signaling, which indicated their potential as therapeutic
modulators. Ye et al. (2002) concluded that their studies identified a
universal mechanism by which TRAF6 regulates several signaling cascades
in adaptive immunity, innate immunity, and bone homeostasis.

One of the E3 ligases responsible for K63-linked NEMO polyubiquitination
is TRAF6, which participates in several signaling pathways controlling
immunity, osteoclastogenesis, skin development, and brain function.
Gautheron et al. (2010) determined that a site at the N terminus of NEMO
(300248) binds the coiled-coil domain of TRAF6 and apparently works in
concert with NEMO's ubiquitin-binding domain to provide a dual mode of
TRAF6 recognition. The E57K NEMO mutation, found in a mild form of
incontinentia pigmenti (308300), resulted in impaired TRAF6 binding and
IL1-beta (147720) signaling. In contrast, activation of NF-kappa-B by
TNF-alpha was not affected. The authors concluded that the NEMO-TRAF6
interaction has physiologic relevance.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TRAF6
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-17696).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In members of 2 Maltese pedigrees with osteoporosis mapping to
chromosome 11q12 (BMND8; 611738), Vidal et al. (2007) sequenced the
TRAF6 gene and identified 3 noncoding sequence variants, including a
-721A-T transversion in the promoter region of the gene that was present
in 3 affected members of 1 family. The promoter variant was also found
in heterozygosity in 3 of 82 unrelated postmenopausal women and in 2 of
350 control chromosomes from the general population.

ANIMAL MODEL

TRAFs are essential to perinatal and postnatal survival. Lomaga et al.
(1999) reported that mice deficient in Traf6 exhibited osteopetrosis
with defects in bone remodeling and tooth eruption due to impaired
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP; see 171640)-positive
osteoclast function. The authors noted that osteoclasts are absent in
Opgl (602642)-deficient mice. In Traf6 knockout mice, however,
osteoclasts were present but lacked contact with bone surfaces and were
unable to resorb significant amounts of bone. Unlike other TRAFs, TRAF6
is required for IL1 signaling. IL1B (147720) stimulation failed to
induce NFKB or JNK/SAPK activation in cells from Traf6 -/- mice.
Inducible nitrous oxide synthase (INOS; see 163729) production in
response to TNF plus IFNG, but not to IL1, was intact in Traf6-deficient
mice. B lymphocytes from knockout mice exposed to anti-CD40 (see 109535)
or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) failed to proliferate or to activate NFKB.
T-lymphocyte proliferation was unaffected by Traf6 deletion.

Naito et al. (2002) reported that Traf6 -/- mice had defective
development of epidermal appendices, including guard hair follicles,
sweat glands, sebaceous glands of back skin, and modified sebaceous
glands, such as meibomian, anal, and preputial glands. Excluding the
sebaceous gland impairment, these abnormal phenotypes are identical to
those observed in 'Tabby' (Ta), 'downless' (dl), and 'crinkled' (cr)
mice, which are models of hypohidrotic (anhidrotic) ectodermal dysplasia
(224900) in humans resulting from mutations in the EDA1 (305100), EDAR
(604095), and EDARADD (606603) genes, respectively. Beta-catenin
(CTNNB1; 116806) and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1
(MADCAM1; 102670), an early marker of developing guard-hair follicles,
were absent in the skin of Traf6-deficient embryos. Thus, TRAF6 is
essential for development of epidermal appendices. Traf6 did not
associate with the cytoplasmic tail of the dl protein, which, when
mutated, results in hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. However, Traf6
associated with XEDAR (300276) and TAJ (606122), which are EDAR-related
members of the TNFR superfamily that are expressed at high levels in
epidermal appendices. The results suggested that TRAF6 may transduce
signals emanating from XEDAR or TAJ that are associated with development
of epidermal appendices.

Ohazama et al. (2004) found that Traf6 mutant mice had abnormalities in
molar teeth that were similar to but more severe than those produced by
mutations in Eda signaling molecules. Sections of first mandibular
molars revealed a major reduction in cusp shape and height compared with
wildtype, demonstrating that Traf6 plays an essential role in cusp
formation.

King et al. (2006) generated healthy mice lacking Traf6 specifically in
T lymphocytes. At 10 to 12 weeks of age, these mice developed
splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, with increased B-cell and Cd4
(186940)-positive T-cell numbers, but fewer Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T
cells. Histopathologic analysis showed systemic inflammation in multiple
organs of mutant mice. Cd4-positive/Cd25 (IL2RA; 147730)-positive
regulatory T cells were present and appeared functional in mutant mice,
but proliferation of Traf6 -/- T cells could not be suppressed by
wildtype or mutant regulatory T cells, suggesting the presence of a
responder T-cell mechanism necessary to render T cells susceptible to
regulation. The resistance to suppression was accompanied by
hyperactivation of PI3K (see 601232)-dependent pathways. King et al.
(2006) concluded that TRAF6 is important in maintaining the balance
between immune activation and suppression.

603214	TITLE *603214 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY D, MEMBER 4; ABCD4
;;PEROXISOMAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN 1-LIKE; PXMP1L;;
P70R;;
PMP69
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ABCD4 gene encodes a protein with several transmembrane domains and
ATPase function. There is a cytosolic nucleotide (ATP)-binding domain
with highly conserved motifs at the C terminus. The protein is involved
in the intracellular processing of cobalamin (vitamin B12) (summary by
Coelho et al., 2012).

CLONING

The peroxisomal membrane contains several ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters, including PMP70 (ABCD3; 170995), ALDP (ABCD1; 300371), and
ALDR (ABCD2; 601081). All 3 proteins are ABC half-transporters, which
dimerize to form an active transporter. See 603076. By searching an EST
database for homologs of PMP70 and ALDP, Shani et al. (1997) and
Holzinger et al. (1997) identified PXMP1L cDNAs. They respectively
designated the gene P70R and PMP69. Shani et al. (1997) reported that
the predicted 606-amino acid protein has the structure of an ABC
half-transporter and shares 25 to 27% sequence identity with PMP70,
ALDR, and ALDP. Antibodies against PXMP1L detected a 73-kD protein on
Western blots. Immunofluorescence studies localized the protein to
peroxisomes. Northern blot analysis revealed that PXMP1L was expressed
as a 2.6-kb mRNA in all tissues examined. Holzinger et al. (1997) and
Holzinger et al. (1998) found transcript variants resulting from
alternative splicing and use of alternative polyadenylation sites.

GENE STRUCTURE

Holzinger et al. (1998) reported that the PXMP1L gene contains 19 exons
and spans approximately 16 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by identity with mapped
clones, Shani et al. (1997) mapped the PXMP1L gene to 14q24. Holzinger
et al. (1998) confirmed this localization by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. They noted that part of a PXMP1L cDNA was included in a
cosmid derived from chromosome 14q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Coelho et al. (2012) demonstrated that ABCD4 colocalized with the
lysosomal proteins LAMP1 (153330) and LMBRD1 (612625), the latter of
which is deficient in methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, type
cblF (277380). Cellular studies with mutant ABCD4 alleles indicated that
the ATPase domain of ABCD4 may be involved in the intracellular
processing of vitamin B12 (cobalamin). The biochemical findings and
localization studies suggested that ABCD4 is involved in the lysosomal
release of cbl into the cytoplasm. Although ABCD4 was initially thought
to be a peroxisomal protein, Coelho et al. (2012) provided evidence
against the involvement of peroxisomes in cbl metabolism.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCER), adrenomyeloneuropathy
(AMN), and AMN with cerebral demyelination are the main phenotypic
variants of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD; 300100), which is caused
by mutation in the ABCD1 gene (300371). The biochemical hallmark of ALD
is the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in plasma and
tissues. Asheuer et al. (2005) studied the expression of the ABCD1,
ABCD2, ABCD3 (170995), and ABCD4 genes and 2 VLCFA synthetase genes,
VLCS (SLC27A2; 603247) and BG1 (ACSBG1; 614362), in fibroblasts and
brains from normal controls and ALD patients with the 3 main phenotypes,
and they studied VLCFA concentrations in normal-appearing white matter
from ALD patients with the 3 main phenotypes. The authors showed that
ABCD1-truncating mutations were unlikely to cause variation in the ALD
phenotype. Accumulation of saturated VLCFA in normal-appearing white
matter correlated with ALD phenotype. Expression of ABCD4 and BG1, but
not of the ABCD2, ABCD3, and VLCS genes, tended to correlate with the
severity of the disease, acting early in the pathogenesis of ALD.

In 2 unrelated children with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria
type cblJ (614857), Coelho et al. (2012) identified 4 different
mutations in the ABCD4 gene (603214.0001-603214.0004) in compound
heterozygous state. The mutations, which were found using
microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and exome sequencing, resulted in
a loss of function. The patients presented soon after birth with
hypotonia, respiratory distress, and evidence of bone marrow failure.
One child had mild dysmorphic features, cardiac abnormalities, and
delayed psychomotor development. Biochemical studies confirmed a defect
in cobalamin metabolism and were similar to abnormalities observed in
patients with cblF (277380). Patient cell lines showed no rescue of the
defect when transfected with LMBRD1, suggesting that these 2 genes
function in the same pathway.

In a North American child with methylmalonic aciduria and
homocystinuria, complementation group J (cblJ; 614857), Coelho et al.
(2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ABCD4
gene: a 956A-G transition resulting in a tyr319-to-cys (Y319C)
substitution in the last transmembrane domain, and a 2-bp insertion
(1746insCT; 603214.0001), resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination (Glu583LeufsTer9) leading to the removal of 14 residues from
the C terminus in the predicted cytosolic nucleotide binding domain. The
mutations were identified by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations. Neither mutation was found in the 1000 Genomes Project data
set. Expression of wildtype ABCD4 in patient fibroblasts led to rescue
of the biochemical phenotype.

In a European child with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria,

compound heterozygosity for 2 splice site mutations in the ABCD4 gene: a
G-T transversion in intron 5 (542+1G-T), resulting in the skipping of
exon 5 (D143_S181del), which encodes 1 of the transmembrane domains, and
a 1456G-T transversion at the last nucleotide in exon 14, resulting in
the skipping of exons 13 and 14 (G443_S485del; 603214.0004) in the
cytosolic nucleotide binding domain. The mutations were identified by
microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and exome sequencing. Neither
mutation was found in the 1000 Genomes Project data set. Expression of
wildtype ABCD4 in patient fibroblasts led to rescue of the biochemical
phenotype.

610825	TITLE *610825 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 25, MEMBER 45; SLC25A45
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC25A45 belongs to the SLC25 family of mitochondrial carrier proteins
(Haitina et al., 2006).

CLONING

By searching databases for SLC25 family members, Haitina et al. (2006)
identified 4 splice variants of SLC25A45. The deduced protein contains
304 amino acids. Quantitative real-time PCR detected variable expression
in most rat tissues examined, with highest levels in skeletal muscle,
intestine, and brain coronal sections containing olfactory bulb and
cerebral cortex.

GENE STRUCTURE

Haitina et al. (2006) determined that the SLC25A45 gene contains 7
exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Haitina et al. (2006) mapped the SLC25A45
gene to chromosome 11. They mapped the mouse gene to chromosome 19.

DESCRIPTION 
GENE FUNCTION

Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA
polymerase II (POLR2A; 180660) is believed to control the transition
from transcription initiation to elongation. The general transcription
factor TFIIH contains a kinase activity capable of phosphorylating this
domain (Lu et al., 1992). Factors that promote the association of RNA
polymerase II with the preinitiation complex stimulate this activity.
TFIIE, which is required for the stable association of TFIIH with the
preinitiation complex, affects the processivity of TFIIH kinase. TFIIH
is a multisubunit factor consisting of at least 5 polypeptides of 92
(133510), 62, 43 (601748), 40, and 35 (601750) kD (Flores et al., 1992).
A 52-kD subunit (601760) has also been identified as a component of the
TFIIH 'core,' along with p89, p62, p44, and p34 (Marinoni et al., 1997).
Lu et al. (1992) expressed the belief that TFIIH is the human
counterpart of the yeast general transcription factor b. See also 133530
and Habraken et al. (1996).

Shiekhattar et al. (1995) purified TFIIH and found that it contained
material that reacted with antibodies to cyclin-dependent kinase 7
(CDK7; 601955) and cyclin H (601953). The authors confirmed the presence
of the CDK-activating kinase complex as a distinct component of TFIIH,
suggesting a link, by the phosphorylation of the cell division cycle 2
(116940) or CDK2 (116953) genes, between TFIIH and the processes of
transcription, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression.

Mammalian CDK8 (603184) and cyclin C (123838) are components of the RNA
polymerase II holoenzyme complex, where they function as a protein
kinase that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit
of RNA polymerase II. The CDK8/cyclin C protein complex is also found in
a number of mammalian 'Mediator'(see 602984)-like protein complexes,
which repress activated transcription independently of the C-terminal
domain in vitro. Akoulitchev et al. (2000) demonstrated that CDK8/cyclin
C can regulate transcription by targeting the CDK7/cyclin H subunits of
TFIIH. CDK8 phosphorylates mammalian cyclin H at serine-5 and serine-304
both in vitro and in vivo, in the vicinity of its functionally unique N-
and C-terminal alpha-helical domains. This phosphorylation represses
both the ability of TFIIH to activate transcription and its C-terminal
kinase activity. In addition, mimicking CDK8 phosphorylation of cyclin H
in vivo has a dominant-negative effect on cell growth. Akoulitchev et
al. (2000) concluded that their results linked the Mediator complex and
the basal transcription machinery by a regulatory pathway involving 2
cyclin-dependent kinases. This pathway appears to be unique to higher
organisms.

High levels of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II depend on high
rates of transcription initiation and reinitiation. Initiation requires
recruitment of the complete transcription machinery to a promoter, a
process facilitated by activators and chromatin remodeling factors.
Reinitiation is thought to occur through a different pathway. After
initiation, a subset of the transcription machinery remains at the
promoter, forming a platform for assembly of a second transcription
complex. Yudkovsky et al. (2000) described the isolation of a
reinitiation intermediate in yeast that includes transcription factors
TFIID, TFIIA (see 600520), TFIIH, TFIIE, and Mediator. This intermediate
can act as a scaffold for formation of a functional reinitiation
complex. Formation of this scaffold is dependent on ATP and TFIIH. In
yeast, the scaffold is stabilized in the presence of the activator
Gal4-VP16, but not Gal4-AH, suggesting a new role for some activators
and Mediator in promoting high levels of transcription.

Hoogstraten et al. (2002) generated cell lines expressing functional
GFP-tagged TFIIH. TFIIH was homogeneously distributed throughout the
nucleus with nucleolar accumulations. The authors provided in vivo
evidence for involvement of TFIIH in RNA polymerase I transcription.
Photobleaching revealed that TFIIH moved freely and was engaged in RNA
polymerase I and II transcription for approximately 25 seconds and
approximately 6 seconds, respectively. TFIIH readily switched between
transcription and repair sites, where it was immobilized for 4 minutes,
without large-scale alterations in composition. These findings supported
a model of diffusion and random collision of individual components that
permits a quick and versatile response to changing conditions.

Trichothiodystrophy (TTD; 601675) is a rare hereditary multisystem
disorder associated with defects in nucleotide excision repair (NER) as
a consequence of mutation in XPD (126340), XPB (133510), or TTDA
(608780), 3 genes that are related to TFIIH. Botta et al. (2002) showed
that all the mutations found in TTD cases, irrespective of whether they
were homozygotes, hemizygotes, or compound heterozygotes, caused a
substantial and specific reduction (by up to 70%) in the cellular
concentration of TFIIH. However, the degree of reduction in TFIIH did
not correlate with the severity of the pathologic phenotype, suggesting
that the severity of the clinical features in TTD cannot be related
solely to the effects of mutations on the stability of TFIIH. Mild
reductions (up to 40%) in TFIIH content were also found in some, but not
all, cell strains from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (see 278700).
Botta et al. (2002) concluded that the severity of the clinical features
in TTD patients and the clinical outcome of differentially mutated XPD
proteins may depend both on the effects that each mutation has on the
stability of TFIIH as well as on the transcriptional activity of the
residual TFIIH complexes.

GENE FAMILY

Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II is a complex process
requiring, in addition to the polymerase itself, 7 auxiliary factors.
Entry of the polymerase into the transcription cycle is mediated by
transcription factor TFIIF (see 189968) and requires a DNA-protein
complex composed of the TATA-binding protein subunit of TFIID (313650)
in association with the TATA motif and TFIIB (189963), the so-called DB
complex. The largest subunit of mammalian RNA polymerase II (POLR2A;
180660) contains a heptapeptide repeat, YSPTSPS in the single-letter
amino acid code, occurring 52 times at its C terminus. Because the
heptapeptide contains serine, threonine, and tyrosine, it is prone to
phosphorylation. As a result, RNA polymerase II occurs in 2 forms in
vivo: a highly phosphorylated II(O) form and a nonphosphorylated II(A)
form. The nonphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II is recruited by
TFIIF to the DB complex. This complex is then recognized by TFIIE
(189962), TFIIH, and TFIIJ, which enter the transcription cycle in that
order, to generate a transcription-competent complex (summary by Lu et
al., 1992).

Giglia-Mari et al. (2004) tabulated the 10 subunits of TFIIH. They
referred to GTF2H1 as TFB1.

MAPPING

Heng et al. (1994) mapped the GTF2H1 gene to 11p15.1-p14 by fluorescence
in situ hybridization.

By PCR analysis on hybrid DNAs and the YACs, Fantes et al. (1995) placed
the GTF2H1 gene in their interval XX between the LDHA/C (150000; 150150)
and the SAA (104750) genes. Furthermore, restriction mapping placed
GTF2H1 within 50 kb of LDHA.

Fantes et al. (1995) described a detailed physical map of 11p, extending
from the distal part of 11p13 through the entirety of 11p14 to proximal
11p15.1. The primary level of mapping was based on chromosome
breakpoints that divided the region into 20 intervals. At higher
resolution, YACs covered approximately 12 Mb of the region. The map
incorporated 18 known genes, including precise localization of the
GTF2H1 gene encoding the 62-kD subunit of TFIIH.

608668	TITLE *608668 ZINC FINGER MYND DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 11; ZMYND11
;;BS69
BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED MOLECULE 1, INCLUDED;
BRAM1, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using adenovirus E1A as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a 16-day
whole mouse embryo cDNA library, followed by screening a human colon
carcinoma cDNA library, Hateboer et al. (1995) cloned ZMYND11, which
they called BS69. The deduced 562-amino acid protein had an apparent
molecular mass of about 69 kD following in vitro transcription and
translation. BS69 contains 2 N-terminal zinc finger motifs, followed by
a nuclear localization signal and a C-terminal E1A-binding domain.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.7-kb transcript in all mouse tissues
examined, with highest expression in kidney.

Using the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse Bmpr1a (601299)
as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human placenta cDNA library,
followed by screening a kidney cDNA library and 5-prime RACE, Kurozumi
et al. (1998) cloned a splice variant of BS69 that they designated
BRAM1. The deduced BRAM1 protein contains the C-terminal 186 amino acids
of BS69 preceded by 12 amino acids unique to BRAM1. Northern blot
analysis detected variable expression of 4.4-kb and 1.3-kb transcripts
in all tissues examined. Following transfection in mouse fibroblasts,
BRAM1 localized to the cytoplasm, whereas BS69 localized to the nucleus.

Masselink and Bernards (2000) noted that BS69 contains 3 motifs involved
in transcription regulation: a PHD finger and bromodomain in its
N-terminal half, and a MYND domain at its extreme C terminus. The MYND
domain, which is also present in the BRAM1 variant, is a 2-zinc finger
motif first identified in Drosophila Deaf1 (602635) and human MTG8
(133435).

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation, Hateboer et al. (1995) confirmed direct
interaction between BS69 and the 289-amino acid isoform of E1A (289R)
following cotransfection in a human cell line; BS69 did not interact
with the shorter 243R E1A isoform. Endogenous BS69 complexed with E1A in
adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cells. C-terminal deletion
mutants of BS69 failed to interact with E1A. BS69 inhibited
transactivation mediated by the 289R E1A protein, but not the 243R E1A
protein. BS69 also suppressed E1A-stimulated transcription of retinoic
acid receptor (see 180240) in COS cells.

Kurozumi et al. (1998) determined that BRAM1 interacts specifically with
the kinase domain of BMPR1A. BS69 did not interact with BMPR1A,
suggesting that the N terminus of BS69 interferes with this interaction.
Further investigation indicated that BRAM1 also interacts with TAB1
(602615). Kurozumi et al. (1998) hypothesized that a ternary complex of
MBPR1A, TAB1, and BRAM1 may be involved in BMP-TAB1-TAK1 (601426)
signaling.

Masselink and Bernards (2000) determined that full transcriptional
repression by BS69 requires the MYND domain. BS69 and BRAM1 interacted
with NCOR (600849) through the MYND domain, but BRAM1 was unable to
repress transcription, indicating that NCOR interaction is necessary but
not sufficient for BS69 repression. Expression of E1A inhibited
repression mediated by BS69.

Ansieau and Leutz (2002) showed that the MYND domain of BS69 interacts
with a conserved PxLxP motif in E1A, the Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein
EBNA2, and a MYC (190080)-related cellular protein, MGA. The viral
proteins competed with MGA for BS69 binding in a PxLxP-dependent
fashion.

MAPPING

By FISH, Masselink and Bernards (2000) mapped the ZMYND11 gene to
chromosome 10p14.

123831	TITLE *123831 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 5; CDK5
;;CELL DIVISION KINASE 5;;
PSSALRE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The p34(CDC2) protein kinase (116940) regulates important transitions in
the eukaryotic cell cycle. Using RT-PCR of HeLa cell mRNA with
degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of CDC2, Meyerson
et al. (1992) identified cDNAs encoding 7 novel human protein kinases.
They designated one of these proteins PSSALRE, following the accepted
practice of naming cdc2-related kinases based on the amino acid sequence
of the region corresponding to the conserved PSTAIRE motif of CDC2. The
predicted 291-amino acid PSSALRE protein shares 57% identity with CDC2.
The in vitro transcription/translation product has an apparent molecular
weight of 31 kD by SDS-PAGE. Northern blot analysis detected PSSALRE
expression in all human tissues and cell lines tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Cyclin-dependent kinase-5 is predominantly expressed in neurons where it
phosphorylates both high molecular weight neurofilaments (NEFH; 162230)
and microtubule-associated protein tau (157140) (Ohshima et al., 1995).

CDK5 is required for proper development of the mammalian central nervous
system (CNS). To be activated, CDK5 must associate with its regulatory
subunit, p35 (CDK5R1; 603460). Patrick et al. (1999) showed that p25, a
truncated form of p35, accumulates in neurons in the brains of patients
with Alzheimer disease (104300). This accumulation correlated with an
increase in CDK5 kinase activity. Unlike p35, p25 was not readily
degraded, and binding of p25 to CDK5 constitutively activated CDK5,
changed its cellular location, and altered its substrate specificity. In
vivo, the p25/CDK5 complex hyperphosphorylated tau, which reduced tau's
ability to associate with microtubules. Moreover, expression of the
p25/CDK5 complex in cultured primary neurons induced cytoskeletal
disruption, morphologic degeneration, and apoptosis. Patrick et al.
(1999) concluded that cleavage of p35, followed by accumulation of p25,
may be involved in the pathogenesis of cytoskeletal abnormalities and
neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases.

Bibb et al. (1999) demonstrated that CDK5 can phosphorylate DARPP32
(604399) at threonine-75, converting it into an inhibitor of PKA (see
176911).

Cocaine enhances dopamine-mediated neurotransmission by blocking
dopamine reuptake at axon terminals. Most dopamine-containing nerve
terminals innervate medium spiny neurons in the striatum of the brain.
Cocaine addiction is thought to stem, in part, from neural adaptations
that act to maintain equilibrium by countering the effects of repeated
drug administration. Chronic exposure to cocaine upregulates several
transcription factors that alter gene expression and which could mediate
such compensatory neural and behavioral changes. One such transcription
factor is delta-FosB (164772), a protein that persists in striatum long
after the end of cocaine exposure. Bibb et al. (2001) identified Cdk5 as
a downstream target of delta-FosB by use of DNA array analysis of
striatal material from inducible transgenic mice. Overexpression of
delta-FosB, or chronic cocaine administration, raised levels of Cdk5
mRNA, protein, and activity in the striatum. Moreover, injection of Cdk5
inhibitors into the striatum potentiated behavioral effects of repeated
cocaine administration. Bibb et al. (2001) concluded that changes in
Cdk5 levels mediated by delta-FosB, and resulting alterations in
signaling involving D1 dopamine receptors, contribute to adaptive
changes in the brain related to cocaine addiction.

Wang et al. (2003) showed that transient forebrain ischemia in rat
caused hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuronal cell death. Ischemia in these
cells led to an increase in p25, which was associated with prolonged
activation of CDK5. Activated CDK5 phosphorylated the NMDA receptor-2A
subunit (NR2A; 138253) at ser1232, resulting in enhanced current
activity through NMDA synaptic receptors. Inhibition of CDK5 or of the
interaction between CDK5 and NR2A protected CA1 pyramidal cells from
ischemic insult. Wang et al. (2003) concluded that modulation of NMDA
receptors by CDK5 is the primary intracellular event underlying ischemic
injury of CA1 pyramidal neurons.

In mice, Smith et al. (2003) showed that administration of MPTP, a toxin
that damages the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, resulted in an
increase of cdk5 expression and activity. Inhibition of cdk5 attenuated
the loss of dopaminergic neurons caused by MPTP. Smith et al. (2003)
suggested that cdk5 may be a regulator of dopaminergic neuron
degeneration in Parkinson disease (168600).

Xie et al. (2003) found that Fak (PTK2; 600758) phosphorylation by Cdk5
was important for microtubule organization, nuclear movement, and
neuronal migration in cultured mouse neurons. Phosphorylated Fak was
enriched along a centrosome-associated microtubule fork abutting the
nucleus. Overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable Fak mutant resulted in
disorganization of the microtubule fork and impaired nuclear movement in
vitro and a neuronal positioning defect in vivo. Xie et al. (2003)
concluded that CDK5 phosphorylation of FAK is critical for neuronal
migration through regulation of a microtubule fork important for nuclear
translocation.

Phosphorylation of doublecortin (DCX; 300121) is developmentally
regulated in brain, and phosphorylation corresponds to expression of
p35, the major activating subunit for CDK5. Tanaka et al. (2004) found
that Dcx was phosphorylated on ser297 by Cdk5 during mouse brain
development. Phosphorylation lowered the affinity of Dcx to microtubules
in vitro, reduced its effect on polymerization, and displaced it from
microtubules in cultured neurons. In addition, mutation of ser297
blocked the effect of Dcx on neuron migration in a fashion similar to
inhibition of Cdk5 activity. Tanaka et al. (2004) concluded that DCX
phosphorylation by CDK5 regulates its actions on migrating neurons
through an effect on microtubules.

In beta cell-derived MIN6 cells and rat pancreatic islets, Wei et al.
(2005) demonstrated that inhibition of CDK5 enhanced insulin secretion
after stimulation by high concentrations of glucose, and p35-null mice
also showed enhanced insulin secretion in response to a glucose
challenge. In beta cells, CDK5 inhibition increased the Ca(2+) influx
across the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (see CACNA1C;
114205) upon stimulation with high glucose, but had no effect without
glucose stimulation. The inhibitory regulation by CDK5 on the beta cell
calcium channel was attributed to the phosphorylation of loop II-III of
CACNA1C at ser783, which prevented binding to SNARE proteins and
subsequently resulted in decreased activity of the channel. Wei et al.
(2005) concluded that CDK5 is part of a signaling cascade in the
regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic beta
cells.

Kim et al. (2006) demonstrated that Wave1 (605035) is phosphorylated at
multiple sites by Cdk5 both in vitro and in intact mouse neurons.
Phosphorylation of Wave1 by Cdk5 inhibited its ability to regulate
Arp2/3 complex (604221)-dependent actin polymerization. Loss of Wave1
function in vivo or in cultured neurons resulted in a decrease in mature
dendritic spines. Expression of a dephosphorylation-mimic mutant of
Wave1 reversed this loss of Wave1 function in spine morphology, but
expression of a phosphorylation-mimic mutant did not. Cyclic AMP
signaling reduced phosphorylation of the Cdk5 sites in Wave1 and
increased spine density in a Wave1-dependent manner. Kim et al. (2006)
concluded that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of WAVE1 in neurons has
an important role in the formation of the filamentous actin
cytoskeleton, and thus in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology.

Choi et al. (2010) showed that obesity induced in mice by high fat
feeding activates the protein kinase CDK5 in adipose tissues. This
results in phosphorylation of the nuclear receptor PPARG (601487), a
dominant regulator of adipogenesis and fat cell gene expression, at
ser273. This modification of PPARG does not alter its adipogenic
capacity, but leads to dysregulation of a large number of genes whose
expression is altered in obesity, including a reduction in the
expression of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine adiponectin (605441).
The phosphorylation of PPARG by CDK5 is blocked by antidiabetic PPARG
ligands such as rosiglitazone and MRL24. This inhibition works both in
vitro and vivo, and is completely independent of classic receptor
transcriptional agonism. Similarly, inhibition of PPARG phosphorylation
in obese patients by rosiglitazone was very tightly associated with the
antidiabetic effects of this drug. Choi et al. (2010) concluded that all
these findings strongly suggested that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of
PPARG may be involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and
presented an opportunity for development of an improved generation of
antidiabetic drugs through PPARG.

Choi et al. (2011) described novel synthetic compounds that have a
unique mode of binding to PPARG, completely lack classic transcriptional
agonism, and block the CDK5-mediated phosphorylation in cultured
adipocytes and in insulin-resistant mice. Moreover, one such compound,
SR1664, has potent antidiabetic activity without causing the fluid
retention and weight gain that are serious side effects of many of the
PPARG drugs. Also, unlike thiazolidinediones, SR1664 does not interfere
with bone formation in culture. Choi et al. (2011) concluded that new
classes of antidiabetes drugs can be developed by specifically targeting
the CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of PPARG.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ohshima et al. (1995) cloned the mouse cdk5 gene and determined that it
contains 12 exons in a region of approximately 5 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Demetrick et al. (1994) mapped
the CDK5 gene to chromosome 7q36. Ohshima et al. (1995) assigned mouse
cdk5 to the centromeric region of mouse chromosome 5 by interspecific
backcross mapping.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ohshima et al. (1996) generated Cdk5-null mice and found that they
exhibited unique lesions in the central nervous system associated with
perinatal mortality. The brains of Cdk5-null mice lacked cortical
laminar structure and cerebellar foliation. In addition, the large
neurons in the brainstem and in the spinal cord showed chromatolytic
changes with accumulation of neurofilament immunoreactivity. The authors
concluded that Cdk5 is an important molecule for brain development and
neuronal differentiation and suggested that Cdk5 may play critical roles
in neuronal cytoskeleton structure and organization.

Using immunohistochemistry and immunoblot experiments, Nguyen et al.
(2001) found that Cdk5 activity and the p25/p35 (see 603460) ratio were
abnormally elevated in the spinal cord of SOD1(G37R) transgenic mice
(see 147450.0001), a mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS;
105400). Using different transgenic mouse lines with various SOD1(G37R)
expression levels, Nguyen et al. (2001) observed a correlation between
Cdk5 activity and the longevity of the transgenic mice. Double
immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that Cdk5 and p25 colocalize
with perikaryal neurofilament accumulations in SOD1(G37R) mutant mice
bred onto a neurofilament mutant background. Nguyen et al. (2001)
hypothesized that perikaryal accumulations of neurofilament proteins in
motor neurons may alleviate ALS pathogenesis in SOD1(G37R) mice by
acting as a phosphorylation sink for Cdk5 activity, thereby reducing the
detrimental hyperphosphorylation of tau and other neuronal substrates.

Cdk5, which is essential for the proper development of the CNS, is also
implicated in numerous complex functions of the adult CNS, such as
synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal signaling. To
elucidate the molecular roles of Cdk5 in the adult CNS, Hirasawa et al.
(2004) abrogated neuronal expression of Cdk5 in perinatal mice using the
Cre-loxP system. The Cdk5-loxP flanked mice were crossed with the Cre
transgenic mice in which the Cre expression was driven by the Nefh
promoter, resulting in generation of viable Cdk5 conditional knockout
mice with the restricted deletion of the Cdk5 gene in specific neurons
beginning around embryonic day 16.5. Twenty-five percent of the Cdk5
conditional knockout mice carrying the heterozygous Cre allele had
neuronal migration defects confined to brain areas where neuronal
migration continues through the perinatal period. The results indicated
that abrogation of Cdk5 expression in mature neurons results in a viable
mouse model that enables investigation of the molecular roles of Cdk5 in
the adult CNS.

Fu et al. (2005) found reduced Erbb2 (164870) and Erbb3 (190151)
phosphorylation and Erbb2 kinase activity in Cdk5-deficient mouse
skeletal muscle. In addition, Cdk5-null mice displayed morphologic
abnormalities at the pre- and postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, and
intramuscular nerve projections exhibited profuse and anomalous
branching patterns. Acetylcholine receptor clustering was also abnormal.
These abnormalities were accompanied by elevated frequency of miniature
endplate potentials in Cdk5-null diaphragm. Fu et al. (2005) concluded
that CDK5 regulates the development of motor axons and neuromuscular
synapses.

Pareek et al. (2006) found high expression of Cdk5 and p35 in primary
afferent nociceptive C fibers in mouse dorsal root ganglia. Induction of
inflammation in peripheral nerves resulted in increased levels of Cdk5,
p35, and p25. P35-null mice showed delayed responses to painful thermal
stimulation, whereas transgenic mice overexpressing p35 were
hypersensitive to painful stimuli compared to controls. Pareek et al.
(2006) concluded that Cdk/p35 plays a role in primary afferent
nociceptive signaling.

607668	TITLE *607668 ADP-RIBOSYLATION-LIKE FACTOR 6-INTERACTING PROTEIN 4; ARL6IP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Sasahara et al. (2000) cloned novel mouse and human cDNAs, which they
designated SR-25, from insulinoma cDNA libraries. The deduced human
218-amino acid protein shares 77.7% sequence identity with the mouse
homolog and contains a serine-arginine (SR) repeat and 2 types of amino
acid clusters: a serine cluster and a highly basic cluster. Northern
blot analysis detected expression in all mouse tissues tested, with
abundant expression in testis and thymus. Based on the structure and
expression pattern of SR-25, Sasahara et al. (2000) suggested that the
protein is localized in the nucleus and may contribute to RNA splicing.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ARL6IP4
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP stSG29931).

607529	TITLE *607529 SERYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE; SARS
;;SERS
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Vincent et al. (1997) assembled 2 overlapping clones of SARS, which they
called SERS, isolated from human fetal and infant brain cDNA libraries.
They obtained the full-length cDNA by 5-prime RACE of a brain cDNA
library. The deduced 514-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular
mass of about 59 kD. SARS has a 2-domain structure consisting of a
tRNA-binding domain and a catalytic domain, which contains the 3 motifs
shared by class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Motifs 2 and 3 share
sequence conservation between prokaryotic and eukaryotic seryl-tRNA
synthetases. SARS has no mitochondrial import signal sequence. Partial
Sars protein sequences from mouse and Chinese hamster share 94% and 92%
identity with human SARS.

GENE FUNCTION

Vincent et al. (1997) assayed bacterially expressed human SARS against
calf liver and E. coli tRNAs and found similar seryl-tRNA synthetase
activity against both substrates.

Using small interfering RNA, Herzog et al. (2009) found that depletion
of SARS from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) increased
cell death, presumably due to loss of the function of SARS in protein
synthesis. However, prior to cell death, SARS depletion caused abnormal
tube formation and increased branching behavior of HUVECs in a rapid
network formation assay. Herzog et al. (2009) concluded that SARS
functions in angiogenesis, in addition to its role in protein synthesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vincent et al. (1997) determined that the SARS gene contains 11 exons
and spans more than 15 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SARS
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG9565).

ANIMAL MODEL

Independently, Fukui et al. (2009) and Herzog et al. (2009) identified
mutations in the zebrafish Sars gene that caused abnormal vascular
development. The function of Sars in vascular development was
independent of its canonical seryl-tRNA synthetase activity.

612137	TITLE *612137 RING FINGER PROTEIN 146; RNF146
;;DACTYLIDIN;;
IDUNA
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Von Rotz et al. (2005) cloned RNF146, which they called dactylidin after
the Greek word for ring, from a human brain cDNA library. The deduced
358-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 38.8 kD. It
contains an N-terminal C3HC4-type RING finger domain, 2 putative
myristoylation sites, and several putative phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb transcript in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle. RNF146
mRNA showed similar abundance in all brain regions examined. Northern
blot analysis of mouse tissues detected highest Rnf146 expression in
heart and lower expression in all other tissues examined, including
skeletal muscle. In situ hybridization of mouse brain revealed
widespread expression of Rnf146 in the cytosol of neurons, but not in
glial cells. Epitope-tagged human RNF146 was detected in the cytosolic
fraction of transfected human glioblastoma cells. Database and Northern
blot analyses suggested that RNF146 may be alternatively spliced.

Andrabi et al. (2011) cloned mouse Rnf146, which they called Iduna after
the Norse goddess of protection and eternal youth. The deduced 359-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 39.8 kD. Iduna contains
an N-terminal RING finger domain and a central WWE domain that has a
poly(ADP-ribose)-binding site. Northern blot analysis detected Iduna
expression in mouse brain, spleen, heart, kidney, testis, and liver,
with 2 transcripts in testis. Western blot analysis detected variable
expression of an Iduna protein with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kD
in mouse brain regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Using quantitative PCR, von Rotz et al. (2005) found that RNF146 mRNA
was upregulated in the inferior temporal lobes of Alzheimer disease
(104300) patients compared with healthy controls.

Glutamate excitotoxicity is mediated largely through influx of calcium
through NMDA receptor (see 138249), leading to activation of PARP1
(173870) and generation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymer, a death signal that
kills cells via AIF (AIFM1; 300169). Andrabi et al. (2011) referred to
poly(ADP-ribose) polymer-induced cell death as parthanatos. Using
real-time PCR, Andrabi et al. (2011) found that Iduna expression
increased in mouse cortical neuronal cultures following exposure to a
sublethal dose of NMDA or oxygen-glucose deprivation. Iduna expression
also increased in mice following brief bilateral common carotid artery
occlusion. Increased Iduna expression protected cells and mice from
subsequent lethal challenge. Knockdown of Iduna expression in mouse
cortical neurons abolished the neuroprotective effect of sublethal NMDA
challenge. Overexpression of human Iduna was protective against
excitotoxic NMDA treatment in mouse cortical neurons in which Iduna
expression had been knocked down. Transient occlusion of the middle
cerebral artery in Iduna-overexpressing mice resulted in significantly
smaller infarct volume and improved neurologic function compared with
wildtype mice. Deletion and mutation analysis revealed that
neuroprotection against NMDA toxicity resulted from Iduna binding to
poly(ADP-ribose) polymer via critical tyrosine and arginine residues
within its central poly(ADP-ribose)-binding region. Andrabi et al.
(2011) concluded that Inuda antagonizes poly(ADP-ribose)
polymer-mediated cell death signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Von Rotz et al. (2005) determined that the RNF146 gene contains 5 exons.
Exon 5 contains the entire coding region.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, von Rotz et al. (2005) mapped the RNF146
gene to chromosome 6q22.1-q22.33.

611665	TITLE *611665 DEAD/H BOX 54; DDX54
;;DEAD BOX RNA HELICASE, 97-KD; DP97
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DEAD box family members, including DDX54, are putative ATP-dependent RNA
helicases that play important roles in a variety of cellular processes
including cell development, differentiation, and proliferation. The name
of the gene family is derived from the amino acid sequence
Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), one of at least 8 highly conserved motifs shared
by the family members. See also DDX8 (600396).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of human breast cancer cells using
antiestrogen-liganded ER-alpha (ESR1; 133430) as bait, followed by
screening a human muscle cDNA library, Rajendran et al. (2003) cloned
DDX54, which they called DP97. The deduced 865-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 97 kD. DDX54 contains 2 bipartite nuclear
localization signals, 3 nuclear receptor boxes (LXXLL motifs), a
potential CoRNR box, and several stretches of glutamate and lysine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.1-kb transcript and a
minor 4.3-kb transcript in several human cancer cell lines and in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in pancreas and lung.
Immunocytochemical studies localized DDX54 to the nucleus where it was
distributed throughout the nucleoplasm and concentrated at the nucleoli.
DDX54 colocalized with ER-alpha to speckled structures in the
nucleoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Rajendran et al. (2003) showed that DDX54 displayed ATP-dependent RNA
helicase activity. In vitro binding and yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed
stronger interaction for antiestrogen-liganded ER-alpha than for
estradiol-liganded ER-alpha. In DDX54-transfected Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells, transactivation assays demonstrated that DDX54 repressed
ER-alpha transcriptional activity, and DDX54 also displayed nuclear
receptor corepressor activity against ER-beta (ESR2; 601663),
progesterone (PGR; 607311), glucocorticoid (GCCR; 138040), and RARA
(180240). Deletion studies and Gal4 fusion studies showed that DDX54
amino acids 589-631 function as the transcriptional repression domain
and that the C-terminal DDX54 amino acids 664-865 interact with the
C-terminal portion of nuclear receptors. Both antisense and siRNA
knockdown of DDX54 caused an increase in ER transcriptional activity and
expression of estradiol-stimulated genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rajendran et al. (2003) mapped the DDX54
gene to chromosome 12q22-q23.

;;CALCIUM CHANNEL, L TYPE, ALPHA-1 POLYPEPTIDE, ISOFORM 6; CACNL1A6
CaV2.3;;
CALCIUM CHANNEL, R TYPE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using mouse Cacn1e as probe, Williams et al. (1994) cloned CACNA1E,
which they designated alpha-1E-1, from a hippocampus cDNA library. The
deduced 2,251-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 255 kD. Williams et al. (1994) also cloned an isoform that has a
19-amino acid repeat sequence. This isoform, which they called
alpha-1E-3, contains 2,270 amino acids and has a calculated molecular
mass of about 257 kD. There are 24 transmembrane regions, organized into
4 repeats of 6 transmembrane regions, which are characteristic of other
Ca(2+) channel alpha-1 subunits. A large cytoplasmic loop exists between
transmembrane regions IIS6 and IIIS1. Alpha-1E-1 contains 1 casein
kinase II (see 115440) phosphorylation site between transmembrane
regions IIS5 and IIS6, and alpha 1E-3 contains 2. Human alpha-1E-3
shares 61% identity with CACNA1A (601011), 60% identity with CACNA1B
(601012), and 96.3% identity with mouse alpha-1E. The mammalian alpha-1E
sequences share about 67% identity with the marine ray doe-1 sequence.
RT-PCR indicated expression in all neuronal tissues tested, as well as
in human kidney and mouse retina, spleen, and pancreatic islet cells.
Expression was also detected in human neuroblastoma, rat insulinoma, and
mouse anterior pituitary cell lines. In situ hybridization of mouse
brain slices revealed wide expression.

GENE FUNCTION

Williams et al. (1994) showed that expression of CACNA1E in human
embryonic kidney cells and Xenopus oocytes produced high
voltage-activated Ca(2+) currents that inactivated rapidly. The current
size was significantly enhanced by coexpression with neuronal
alpha-2/delta (114204) and beta (see 114207) Ca(2+) channel subunits.

MAPPING

Diriong et al. (1995) mapped the CACNL1A6 gene to 1q25-q31 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Yamazaki et al. (1998) confirmed the
mapping to 1q25-q32 by radiation hybrid analysis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Matsuda et al. (2001) found that Cacna1e-null mice were heavier than
wildtype mice. In glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests, mutant
mice showed a significantly higher blood glucose level. However,
stress-induced blood glucose changes were similar to wildtype mice.

In Cacna1e-null mice, Jing et al. (2005) observed a 20% reduction in
glucose-evoked insulin secretion. Dynamic insulin release measurements
demonstrated that genetic or pharmacologic Cacna1e ablation strongly
suppressed second-phase secretion, whereas first-phase secretion was
unaffected, both in vitro and in vivo. Suppression of the second phase
coincided with an 18% reduction in oscillatory Ca(2+) signaling and a
25% reduction in hormone-containing granule recruitment after completion
of the initial exocytotic burst in individual null beta cells. Jing et
al. (2005) proposed that CACNA1E channels have a specific role in
second-phase insulin release by mediating the Ca(2+) entry needed for
replenishment of the releasable pool of granules.

610973	TITLE *610973 MEMBRANE PROTEIN, PALMITOYLATED 7; MPP7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) are important adaptor
proteins involved in the assembly of protein complexes at sites of
cell-cell contact. They are found in synapses, adherens junctions, and
tight junctions. All MAGUKs contain at least 1 PDZ domain, an SH3
domain, and a GUK domain, and many contain 1 or 2 L27 domains, which are
involved in multimerization of MAGUKs. MPP7 belongs to the p55 stardust
subfamily of MAGUKs, which is named for a Drosophila gene required for
establishment of cell polarity in the developing fly embryo (Bohl et
al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching databases for homologs of MPP5 (606958), Katoh and Katoh
(2004) identified MPP7. The deduced 576-amino acid protein has 2 L27
domains (L27N and L27C) at its N terminus, followed by a PDZ domain, an
SH3 domain, and a C-terminal GUK domain. It shares 93% amino acid
identity with mouse Mpp7, 76% identity with the zebrafish humpback
protein, and 56% identity with human MPP3 (601114). In silico expression
analysis suggested that MPP7 is widely expressed.

GENE FUNCTION

Bohl et al. (2007) found that MPP7 formed a tripartite complex with DLG1
(601014) and LIN7A (603380) or LIN7C in vitro and in vivo. MPP7
dimerized with the LIN7 proteins through its L27C domain. The LIN7/MPP7
dimer then linked to DLG1 though the L27N domain of MPP7. This complex
localized to epithelial adherens junctions in transfected Madin-Darby
canine kidney cells. Expression of an MPP7 construct lacking either the
PDZ or SH3 domain redistributed MPP7, DLG1, and LIN7 into the soluble
cytoplasmic fraction.

Stucke et al. (2007) showed that the L27N domain of endogenous MPP7
bound DLG1 in human epithelial cells. The SH3-HOOK domain of MPP7
interacted with MPP5, and in turn MPP5 interacted with CRB3 (609737).
MPP7 and DLG1 colocalized at the lateral surface of epithelial cells,
and they overlapped with markers of adherens junctions and tight
junctions. Recruitment of MPP7 to the plasma membrane was dependent on
its L27N-mediated interaction with DLG1 and on CRB3-dependent
recruitment via the SH3-HOOK domain of MPP7. Loss of either DLG1 or MPP7
from epithelial cells resulted in a significant defect in assembly and
maintenance of functional tight junctions. Stucke et al. (2007)
concluded that formation of the DLG1-MPP7 complex promotes epithelial
cell polarity and tight junction formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Katoh and Katoh (2004) determined that the MPP7 gene contains at least
19 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh and Katoh (2004) mapped the MPP7
gene to chromosome 10p12.1.

605747	TITLE *605747 LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR ADAPTOR PROTEIN 1; LDLRAP1
;;LDLR ADAPTOR PROTEIN 1;;
ARH GENE; ARH
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LDLRAP1 is an adaptor protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail
of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR; 606945), phospholipids, and
components of the clathrin (see CLTC; 118955) endocytic machinery
(Garuti et al., 2005).

CLONING

Garcia et al. (2001) cloned the ARH gene after performing linkage
analysis in families suffering from autosomal recessive
hypercholesterolemia (ARH; 603813) that mapped the ARH locus to a 1-cM
interval on chromosome 1p35. The gene encodes a 308-amino acid protein
containing a 170-amino acid phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which
shares considerable sequence similarity with the PTB domains of many
adaptor proteins. PTB domains bind the consensus sequence NPXY, which is
present in the cytoplasmic domains of several cell surface receptors,
including LDLR. The integrity of the NPXY sequence in the cytoplasmic
tail of LDLR is absolutely required for internalization, and LDLR has
been shown in vitro to bind other proteins containing PTB domains. The
human ARH protein shares 89% sequence identity with orthologous proteins
in mouse and Xenopus. By Northern blot analysis, Garcia et al. (2001)
found that ARH is normally expressed at high levels in the kidney,
liver, and placenta, with lower levels detectable in brain, heart,
muscle, colon, spleen, intestine, lung, and leukocytes.

Nagai et al. (2003) reported that the N-terminal half of human, rat, and
mouse ARH contains the PTB domain, and the C-terminal half contains a
clathrin box (LLDLE), a beta-2 adaptin (AP2B1; 601025)-binding site, and
a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid, pull-down, and coimmunoprecipitation assays, Nagai
et al. (2003) found that rat Arh bound the first FxNPxY motif of megalin
(LRP2; 600073). Arh colocalized with megalin in clathrin-coated pits and
in recycling endosomes in the Golgi region of rat L2 cells. Upon
internalization of megalin, megalin and Arh colocalized in
clathrin-coated pits, followed by their colocalization in early
endosomes and tubular recycling endosomes in the pericentriolar region,
and then by their reappearance at the cell surface. Expression of Arh in
canine kidney cells expressing megalin minireceptors enhanced
megalin-mediated uptake of lactoferrin (LTF; 150210), a megalin ligand.
Nagai et al. (2003) concluded that ARH facilitates endocytosis of
megalin and escorts megalin along its endocytic route.

By biochemical assays and electron microscopy, Michaely et al. (2004)
found that lymphocytes from patients with ARH deficiency had over
20-fold more LDLR on the cell surface and about 27-fold excess of LDLR
outside of coated pits. However, despite the increase in cell surface
receptors, LDL binding was only 2-fold higher in ARH-deficient
lymphocytes. Michaely et al. (2004) concluded that ARH is not only
required for internalization of the LDL-LDLR complex, but also for
efficient binding of LDL to the receptor.

By mutation analysis, Garuti et al. (2005) found that integrity of the
FDNPVY sequence in LDLR was required for ARH-associated LDLR clustering
into clathrin-coated pits in polarized hepatocytes. The
phosphotyrosine-binding domain of ARH plus either the clathrin box or
the AP2-binding region was required for LDLR clustering and
internalization. These findings were confirmed in vivo by expressing the
same ARH mutants in livers of Arh -/- mice. Garuti et al. (2005)
concluded that ARH must bind the LDLR tail and either clathrin or AP2 to
promote receptor clustering and internalization of LDL.

Sirinian et al. (2005) found that ARH codistributed with LDLR on the
basolateral surface of polarized confluent HepG2 cells. Activation of
LDLR-mediated endocytosis, but not binding of LDL to LDLR, promoted
colocalization of ARH with the LDL-LDLR complex. Depletion of ARH by
more than 70% by RNA interference caused an 80% reduction in LDL
internalization. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis of LDL-stimulated
polarized HepG2 cells showed that ARH interacted with other components
of the endocytic machinery, including beta-adaptin, DAB2 (601236), and
the small GTPase RAB4 (179511). Sirinian et al. (2005) concluded that
ARH is not constitutively associated with LDLR at the plasma membrane,
but is recruited to the membrane after LDL binding, thus facilitating
endocytosis of the LDL-LDLR complex.

GENE STRUCTURE

Garcia et al. (2001) determined that the ARH gene spans 25 kb and
contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Garcia et al. (2001) mapped the ARH gene
to chromosome 1p35.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Of the 6 mutations identified in ARH by Garcia et al. (2001), 1 was a
frameshift (605747.0002) found in homozygosity among 1 set of Sardinian
families. A nonsense mutation (605747.0003) was identified in 1 of the
Lebanese families; only trace amounts of ARH mRNA was detected in
cultured fibroblasts from patients with this mutation. The other
Lebanese family was homozygous for a missense mutation (605747.0004)
that was associated with a normal level of ARH mRNA in cultured
fibroblasts. Garcia et al. (2001) found that the defect in LDLR function
in ARH patients appeared to be not only receptor-specific, but also
tissue-specific. They were not able to identify a consistent defect in
LDLR function (binding, uptake, or internalization) in cultured
fibroblasts from ARH patients. It is possible that another PTB domain
protein compensates for the absence of ARH in cultured fibroblasts, or
that adaptor molecules are not required for receptor-mediated
endocytosis of LDL in fibroblasts and possibly other extrahepatic cells.

Arca et al. (2002) performed extensive clinical and molecular genetic
studies in 28 Sardinians with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia
from 17 unrelated families. They sequenced the coding regions and
consensus splice sites of the ARH gene in probands from these families,
and from 40 individuals of non-Sardinian origin who had an autosomal
recessive form of hypercholesterolemia of unknown cause. In all 17
unrelated Sardinian families, 2 ARH mutations were present, 432insA in
exon 4 (605747.0002), referred to as ARH1 by them, and a nonsense
mutation, 65G-A in exon 1 (trp22 to ter; 605747.0001), referred to as
ARH2 by them. Three of the ARH alleles in the Sardinian patients
contained both mutations, as a result of an ancient recombination
between ARH1 and ARH2. No regional clustering of the 3 mutant alleles
was apparent. Furthermore, 4 Italians from the mainland with autosomal
recessive hypercholesterolemia were homozygous for ARH1. The small
number, high frequency, and dispersed distribution of ARH mutations on
Sardinia were consistent with these mutations being ancient and
maintained in the Sardinian population because of geographic isolation.

Mishra et al. (2002) showed that the ARH protein is a component of the
endocytic machinery, with mutations of the ARH gene contributing to the
LDL-uptake-disease phenotype of ARH patients. PTB domains of the ARH
protein bind to the internalization motif of the LDL receptor. The
authors showed that in addition, ARH binds directly to soluble clathrin
trimers and to clathrin adaptors. At steady state, ARH colocalizes with
endocytic proteins in HeLa cells, and the LDL receptor fluxes through
peripheral ARH-positive sites before delivery to early endosomes. Their
findings suggested that in ARH patients, defective sorting adaptor
function in hepatocytes leads to faulty LDL receptor traffic and
hypercholesterolemia.

To define the molecular mechanism underlying autosomal recessive
hypercholesterolemia, Wilund et al. (2002) examined ARH mRNA and protein
in fibroblasts and lymphocytes from 6 hypercholesterolemic patients with
different ARH mutations. Five probands were homozygous for mutations
that introduced premature termination codons; the sixth patient was
homozygous for a 2.6-kb insertion in intron 1 which was associated with
no detectable ARH mRNA. None of the probands had detectable full-length
ARH protein in fibroblasts or lymphoblasts. No relationship was apparent
between the site of the mutation in ARH and the amount of mRNA.
Radiolabeled LDL degradation was normal in ARH fibroblasts, but LDLR
function was markedly reduced in ARH lymphoblasts, despite a 2-fold
increase in LDL cell surface binding in these cells. Wilund et al.
(2002) concluded that ARH is required for normal LDLR function in
lymphocytes and hepatocytes, but not in fibroblasts, and that residual
LDLR function in cells that do not require ARH may explain why ARH
patients have lower plasma LDL levels than do patients with homozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia (144010) who have no functional LDLRs.

Al-Kateb et al. (2002) studied a Syrian family in which 3 sibs had
elevated LDL levels; 3 other sibs and both parents had normal LDL
levels, suggesting an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. A
genomewide scan using 427 markers showed support for linkage on both
chromosomes 1 and 13, with significant lod scores at 1p36.1-p35 and
13q22-q32 (see cholesterol-lowering factor, 604595). Al-Kateb et al.
(2002) found evidence for an interaction between these loci. They
identified an intron 1 acceptor splice site mutation in the ARH gene
(605747.0007) in homozygous state in the affected sibs and in
heterozygous state in the parents.

In 2 affected sibs from a nonconsanguineous Mexican family with
autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia, Canizales-Quinteros et al.
(2005) identified homozygosity for a donor splice site mutation in
intron 4 of the ARH gene (605747.0008).

ANIMAL MODEL

Jones et al. (2003) generated Arh-deficient mice and found that the
fractional clearance rate of radiolabeled Ldl in these mice was lower
than that in Ldlr -/- mice. By immunolocalization studies, they
demonstrated that Ldl receptors are sorted normally to the sinusoidal
surface in Arh -/- mouse livers. Jones et al. (2003) concluded that the
Ldl internalization defect in Arh-deficient mice is caused by the
inability of the receptors to enter the endocytic cycle.

Jones et al. (2007) examined the synthesis and catabolism of Vldl in
mouse models of autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (Ldlr
-/-) and ARH (Arh -/-). Despite similar rates of Vldl secretion in
response to a high-sucrose diet, the rate of Vldl clearance was
significantly higher in Arh-null mice than in Ldlr-null mice, suggesting
that LDLR-dependent uptake of VLDL is maintained in the absence of ARH.
Hepatocytes from Arh-null mice, but not Ldlr-null mice, internalized
beta-Vldl, demonstrating that ARH is not required for LDLR-dependent
uptake of VLDL by the liver. Jones et al. (2007) concluded that the
preservation of VLDL remnant clearance attenuates the phenotype of ARH
and likely contributes to greater responsiveness to statins in ARH
compared with FH.

(603813), Al-Kateb et al. (2002) identified a G-to-C transversion in the
acceptor splice site of intron 1 of the ARH gene. Al-Kateb et al. (2003)
found that the mutation caused the deletion of 2 bp from the start of
exon 2, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein due to a
premature stop codon (TGA) 2 codons later.

autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (603813), Canizales-Quinteros
et al. (2005) identified homozygosity for a +2T-G transversion in intron
4 of the ARH gene, resulting in the activation of a cryptic splice site
and the expression of a mutant protein lacking 26 amino acids involving
the beta-6 and beta-7 strands of the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB)
domain. The authors stated that this was the first case of an ARH
mutation causing an altered PTB domain. Both parents and an unaffected
sister were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 41
unrelated normolipidemic Mexican individuals.

In 2 Japanese sibs with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia
(603813), Harada-Shiba et al. (2003) identified a novel insertion in the
ARH gene of a cytosine in the tract of 8 cytosines at positions 599
through 606 in exon 6, resulting in a sequence of 9 cytosines and
generating an early stop codon at 657-659. The mother was heterozygous
for this mutation. Neither transcription product nor protein of ARH was
detected in the fibroblasts of the homozygous patients. Both sibs
exhibited fatty liver, which may also be related to this mutation.

604726	TITLE *604726 SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 17A; STK17A
;;DAP KINASE-RELATED APOPTOSIS-INDUCING PROTEIN KINASE 1; DRAK1
DESCRIPTION Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a highly regulated process that
is crucial in development. Deregulation of apoptosis is responsible for
a wide range of diseases such as autoimmune and neurodegenerative
disorders. By sequence homology searches using the catalytic domains of
2 serine/threonine kinases important in the regulation of apoptosis, DAP
kinase (600954) and ZIP kinase (603289), Sanjo et al. (1998) cloned 2
novel members of the ser/thr protein kinase family, which they termed
DRAK1 and DRAK2 (604727), but which were later designated STK17A and
STK17B, respectively. The full-length STK17A cDNA encodes a deduced
414-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 46.56 kD. The putative
kinase domain is located at the N terminus and contains all 11
subdomains conserved among ser/thr kinases. STK17A and STK17B share
59.7% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis revealed that STK17A
is expressed as a 1.9-kb transcript predominantly in placenta, but also
in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. An in vitro assay
demonstrated that STK17A is capable of autophosphorylation and of
phosphorylating myosin light chain as an exogenous substrate, and that
the noncatalytic C terminus is crucial for full kinase activity.
Immunofluorescence studies showed that both STK17A and STK17B are
localized in the nucleus. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with STK17A
expression plasmid displayed the morphologic changes typical of cells
undergoing apoptosis, but not when transfected with STK17A with an
inactivated kinase domain or a truncated noncatalytic C-terminal region.
A colony formation assay showed that the apoptosis-inducing activity of
STK17A requires the intact structure of the entire gene and that STK17A
and STK17B share similar levels of apoptosis-inducing activity.

603288	TITLE *603288 KERATOCAN; KERA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Keratan sulfate proteoglycans (KSPGs) are members of the small
leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. KSPGs, particularly keratocan,
lumican (600616), and mimecan (602383), are important to the
transparency of the cornea (summary by Funderburgh et al., 1998).

CLONING

Liu et al. (1998) isolated mouse keratocan cDNA and genomic DNA. Mouse
keratocan cDNA predicts a 351-amino acid polypeptide containing a
conserved central leucine-rich repeat region. Northern blot analysis of
mouse tissues revealed that keratocan is expressed selectively in the
eye throughout development. In situ hybridization demonstrated that
keratocan is expressed early in neural crest development and later in
corneal stromal cells.

Tasheva et al. (1999) isolated the cDNA and identified the genomic
structure of the human keratocan gene. An open reading frame starting at
the beginning of the second exon encodes a protein of 352 amino acids.
The amino acid sequence of keratocan shows high identity among mammalian
species. This evolutionary conservation between the keratocan proteins
as well as the restricted expression of the KERA gene in cornea suggests
that this molecule might be important in developing and maintaining
corneal transparency.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tasheva et al. (1999) demonstrated that the human keratocan gene is
spread over 7.65 kb of DNA and contains 3 exons.

MAPPING

Funderburgh et al. (1998) mapped the mouse keratocan gene to distal
mouse chromosome 10, very closely linked to the lumican gene. By
fluorescence in situ hybridization, Tasheva et al. (2000) mapped the
human keratocan gene to 12q22. Pellegata et al. (2000) independently
cloned the human KERA gene and mapped it to 12q.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pellegata et al. (2000) identified mutations in KERA in 47 patients with
recessive cornea plana (CNA2; 217300). Forty-six Finnish patients were
homozygous for a founder missense mutation (603288.0001), and 1 American
patient was homozygous for a mutation leading to a premature stop codon
that truncates the KERA protein (603288.0002). No mutations in KERA were
identified in CNA1 patients (121400).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CORNEA PLANA 2
KERA, ASN247SER

In 46 Finnish patients with autosomal recessive cornea plana (CNA2;
217300), Pellegata et al. (2000) found homozygosity for an A-to-G
transition resulting in an asparagine-to-serine substitution at codon
247 of the KERA gene (N247S). This amino acid substitution affects the N
residue in the LRR consensus motif, the most highly conserved amino acid
in the LRR motif throughout the SLRP family. This result agreed with the
hypothesis that all Finnish CNA2 patients share a single mutation
inherited from a common founding ancestor. None of 154 grandparents of
CEPH families carried the mutated allele, nor did any of 121 anonymous
blood donors from southern Finland. Among blood donors from northeastern
Finland, where most CNA2 patients originate, Pellegata et al. (2000)
found 2 individuals heterozygous for the mutated allele. A carrier
frequency of 2 in 126 is in agreement with expectations based on disease
incidence.

Sipila and Aula (2002) announced the creation of an up-to-date database
for the mutations of the Finnish disease heritage, i.e., the more than
30 monogenic disorders that are more prevalent in the Finnish population
than in the rest of the world. They noted that all Finnish cases of
cornea plana have had the N247S mutation.

.0002
CORNEA PLANA 2
KERA, GLN174TER

In an American CNA2 (217300) patient of Chinese origin, Pellegata et al.
(2000) identified a homozygous CAG-to-TAG transition in exon 2 that
caused a change of glutamine to a premature termination codon at codon
174 of the KERA gene (Q174X). This was the only genetic change found in
the entire coding region and intron-exon boundaries of the gene. Both
parents were heterozygous for this mutation. The parents were first
cousins.

.0003
CORNEA PLANA 2
KERA, THR215LYS

In a consanguineous pedigree in which cornea plana (217300) cosegregated
with microphthalmia, Lehmann et al. (2001) identified a C-to-A
transversion at codon 215 of the KERA gene, resulting in a thr215-to-lys
(T215K) substitution at the start of a highly conserved leucine-rich
repeat motif. Structural modeling predicted that this mutation altered
the length and position of 1 of these motifs on the beta-sheet array of
keratocan. The authors concluded that normal corneal function is
dependent on the regular spacing of collagen fibrils, and the predicted
alteration of the tertiary structure of KERA is the probable mechanism
of the cornea plana phenotype.

.0004
CORNEA PLANA 2
KERA, ARG313TER

In 5 children with autosomal recessive cornea plana (217300), the
offspring of first-cousin parents of ethnic Arab origin, Khan et al.
(2004) identified homozygosity for a 937C-T transition in exon 3 of the
KERA gene, resulting in a change of arginine to a premature termination
codon at codon 313 (R131X). The resulting truncated protein lacks the
highly conserved eleventh LRR motif of normal keratocan. Both parents
were heterozygous for the mutation, which was absent in a clinically
unaffected sib.

615354	TITLE *615354 LIGAND-DEPENDENT NUCLEAR RECEPTOR-INTERACTING FACTOR 1; LRIF1
;;RECEPTOR-INTERACTING FACTOR 1; RIF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

LRIF1 is a nuclear protein that represses ligand-dependent activation of
nuclear hormone receptors (Li et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA; 180240) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a human B cell cDNA library, followed by screening a
bone marrow cDNA library, Li et al. (2007) cloned LRIF1, which they
called RIF1. The deduced 739-amino acid protein contains a RARA-binding
domain, a transcriptional repression domain, and a C-terminal heptad
repeat predicted to form an amphipathic alpha-helical wheel, all in the
C-terminal portion. RIF1 also contains a predicted bipartite nuclear
localization signal. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression
of 3.5- and 1.8-kb RIF1 transcripts in all human tissues and cell lines
examined. In tissues, highest expression was detected in heart, liver,
and placenta. Epitope-tagged RIF1 was expressed in nuclei of transfected
HeLa cells, with exclusion from nucleoli.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein pull-down assays, Li et al. (2007) found that RIF1
interacted with a number of human nuclear hormone receptors, including
ER-alpha (ESR1; 133430), GR-alpha (GCCR; 138040), TR-alpha (THRA;
190120), and PPAR-gamma (PPARG; 601487) and with mouse ROR-alpha (RORA;
600825), as well as with human RARA, but not with RXR (RXRA; 180245).
Addition of cognate hormones for these receptors did not alter their
interactions with RIF1. Overexpression of epitope-tagged RIF1 in MCF7
cells redistributed RARA from the cytosolic and chromatin fractions to
the nuclear matrix fraction. Full-length and the isolated C-terminal 100
amino acids of RIF1 showed strong transcriptional repression activity in
a dose-dependent manner, which depended upon recruitment of histone
deacetylase activity. Coexpression studies revealed that RIF1 inhibited
ligand-induced transcriptional activation of RARA in a dose-dependent
manner. Li et al. (2007) concluded that RIF1 functions as a
transcriptional repressor in part through recruitment of histone
deacetylases.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Li et al. (2007) mapped the LRIF1 gene to
chromosome 1p12.

608610	TITLE *608610 PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH 4; PDCD4
;;NEOPLASTIC TRANSFORMATION INHIBITOR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening a glioma cDNA expression library with antibodies raised
against a nuclear protein, Matsuhashi et al. (1997) cloned PDCD4, which
they designated H731. The deduced 458-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 50.6 kD. PDCD4 is an acidic protein with
characteristics of a nuclear nonhistone protein. It contains 2
overlapping GxGxxG nucleotide-binding motifs, which are characteristic
of protein kinases, but it does not have a kinase catalytic domain.
PDCD4 also has several putative serine and threonine phosphorylation
sites. Northern blot analysis detected transcripts of about 2.7 and 3.8
kb in HeLa cell total RNA. Recombinant PDCD4 expressed in E. coli
resulted in proteins with apparent molecular masses of 56 and 37 kD. The
37-kD truncated protein was synthesized from val127, reading the val
codon as an f-met initiation codon.

Yoshinaga et al. (1999) found that PDCD4 accumulated in the nuclei of
confluent or quiescent normal fetal lung fibroblasts, but it was
overproduced and localized in the cytoplasm during the cell cycle in
tumor cell lines. Immunohistologic analysis revealed that PDCD4 was
highly expressed in bladder carcinoma and breast carcinoma tissues
compared with normal tissues. PDCD4 was also abundantly expressed in the
small duct epithelial cells of normal mammary gland.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot and Western blot analyses, Kang et al. (2002)
determined that expression of both the PDCD4 transcript and protein was
upregulated in senescent diploid fibroblasts compared with cells in log
phase growth. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis showed that the C terminus of
PDCD4 could interact with a component of the 40S ribosome complex, RPS13
(180476), and with RPL5 (603634) and TI-227H. In vitro binding assays
confirmed the interaction between PDCD4 and RPS13. In vitro pull-down
assays also showed that PDCD4 interacted with EIF4G (600495), but not
with EIF4E (133440). Furthermore, PDCD4 localized to polysome fractions
of fractionated HeLa cells. Kang et al. (2002) concluded that PDCD4 may
regulate EIF4G-dependent translation through direct interaction with
EIF4G and RPS13 in senescent fibroblasts.

Dorrello et al. (2006) found that the tumor suppressor PDCD4 inhibits
the translation initiation factor EIF4A (see 602641), an RNA helicase
that catalyzes the unwinding of secondary structure at the 5-prime
untranslated region of mRNAs. In response to mitogens, PDCD4 was rapidly
phosphorylated on ser67 by the protein kinase S6K1 (608938) and
subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin ligase SCF-beta(TRCP) (603482).
Expression in cultured cells of a stable PDCD4 mutant that was unable to
bind beta-TRCP inhibited translation of an mRNA with a structured
5-prime untranslated region, resulted in smaller cell size, and slowed
down cell cycle progression. Dorrello et al. (2006) proposed that
regulated degradation of PDCD4 in response to mitogens allows efficient
protein synthesis and consequently cell growth.

PDCD4 contains 2 tandem MA3 domains consisting of conserved
alpha-helical hairpins. Using x-ray crystallography, NMR, and surface
plasmon resonance, Suzuki et al. (2008) found that both MA3 domains of
human PDCD4 were structurally and functionally similar and bound
specifically to the N-terminal domain of EIF4A using similar binding
interfaces. The MA3 domains of PDCD4 competed with the MA3 domain of
EIF4G and RNA for EIF4A binding. Suzuki et al. (2008) concluded that
PDCD4 inhibits translation initiation by displacing EIF4G and RNA from
EIF4A. They proposed that the PDCD4 MA3 domains act synergistically to
form a tighter and more stable complex with EIF4A, explaining the need
for 2 tandem MA3 domains.

Davis et al. (2008) demonstrated that induction of a contractile
phenotype in human vascular smooth muscle cells by TGF-beta (190180) and
BMPs (see 112264) is mediated by miR21 (611020). miR21 downregulates
PDCD4, which in turn acts as a negative regulator of smooth muscle
contractile genes. Davis et al. (2008) concluded that PDCD4 is a
functional target of miR21 involved in the BMP-mediated induction of
smooth muscle cell markers in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Asangani et al. (2008) identified an miR21 target sequence in the
3-prime UTR of PDCD4 and confirmed binding and inhibition of PDCD4 by
miR21 using reporter gene assays. They observed an inverse correlation
between miR21 and PDCD4 expression in 10 colorectal cell lines and in 22
colorectal cancer tissues and matched normal controls. Transfection of
RKO human colorectal cancer cells with anti-miR21 increased PDCD4
protein concentration, reduced the invasive potential of RKO cells in
3-dimensional gels, and reduced intravasation and lung metastasis of RKO
cells in a chicken embryo metastasis assay. Overexpression of miR21
reduced expression of PDCD4 protein, but not mRNA, in Colo206f cells.

MAPPING

By FISH, Soejima et al. (1999) mapped the PDCD4 gene to chromosome
10q24.

606203	TITLE *606203 GRB2-ASSOCIATED BINDING PROTEIN 2; GAB2
;;KIAA0571
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The GAB2 gene encodes an adaptor molecule that is the principal
activator of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PIK3; see 171833) in
response to activation of the high-affinity IgE receptor (see 147140)
(Gu et al., 2001).

CLONING

Nishida et al. (1999) identified GAB2 as a 100-kD adaptor molecule
(pp100) interacting with SHP2 (176876) and PI3 kinase in response to
various stimuli. The human GAB2 gene encodes a 676-amino acid protein
with a pleckstrin homology domain, proline-rich sequences, and tyrosine
residues that bind to SH2 domains when they are phosphorylated.

Zhao et al. (1999) identified a human adaptor molecule containing a
pleckstrin homology domain at the N terminus that is closely related to
GAB1 (604439) and Drosophila 'daughter of sevenless' (Dos). Zhao et al.
(1999) called this protein GAB2. Northern blot analysis indicated that
GAB2 is widely expressed and has an overlapping but distinctive
expression pattern as compared with that of GAB1, with high levels of
GAB2 mRNA detected in the heart, brain, placenta, spleen, ovary,
peripheral blood leukocytes, and spinal cord.

Nishida et al. (1999) and Zhao et al. (1999) identified cDNA KIAA0571
(Nagase et al., 1998) as GAB2. Nagase et al. (1998) reported the high
homology of GAB2 with GAB1 (34.2% amino acid identity).

GENE FUNCTION

Nishida et al. (1999) showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of GAB2 is
induced by stimulation through gp130 (IL6ST; 600694), IL2R (147730),
IL3R (308385), TPOR (159530), SCFR (164920), and TCR (see 186880). The
authors showed GAB1 and GAB2 to be substrates for SHP2 in vitro.

Zhao et al. (1999) demonstrated that upon tyrosine phosphorylation, GAB2
physically interacts with SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase and GRB2 adaptor
protein (604330). GAB2 has an inhibitory effect on the activation of
ELK1 (311040)-dependent transcription triggered by a dominant active Ras
(190020) mutant or under growth factor stimulation, whereas GAB1 acts to
potentiate slightly the ELK1 activity in the same system. In contrast to
the reciprocal effects of GAB1 and GAB2 in mediating ELK1 induction,
these 2 molecules have a similar function in extracellular
signal-regulated kinase activation induced by either oncogenic Ras or
growth factor stimulation. Zhao et al. (1999) concluded that GAB1 and
GAB2 may have distinct roles in coupling cytoplasmic-nuclear signal
transduction.

Wada et al. (2005) determined that GAB2 has a role in osteoclast
differentiation. GAB2 interacted with the C-terminal domain of RANK
(603499) and mediated differentiation through a signaling pathway that
included NFKB (see 164011), AKT (see AKT1; 164730), and JNK (see MAPK8;
601158).

The scaffolding adaptor GAB2 maps to 11q13.4-q13.5, a region commonly
amplified in human breast cancer, and is overexpressed in breast cancer
cell lines and primary tumors. Bentires-Alj et al. (2006) found that
overexpression of GAB2 increases proliferation of MCF10A mammary cells
in 3-dimensional culture. Coexpression of GAB2 with antiapoptotic
oncogenes caused luminal filling, whereas coexpression with NEU (also
known as ERBB2 and HER2; 164870) resulted in an invasive phenotype.
These effects of GAB2 were mediated by hyperactivation of the SHP2-ERK
pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of Gab2 potentiated, whereas
deficiency of Gab2 ameliorated, Neu-evoked breast carcinogenesis in
mice. Finally, Bentires-Alj et al. (2006) found that GAB2 is amplified
in some GAB2-overexpressing human breast tumors. Their data suggested
that GAB2 may be a key gene within an 11q13 amplicon in human breast
cancer and proposed a role for overexpression of GAB2 in mammary
carcinogenesis. The authors suggested that agents that target GAB2 or
GAB2-dependent pathways may be useful for treating breast tumors that
overexpress GAB2 or HER2 or both.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the GAB2 gene to chromosome 11 using a
radiation hybrid panel. By FISH, Yamada et al. (2001) mapped the GAB2
gene to human chromosome 11q13.4-q13.5 and mouse chromosome 7E2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Reiman et al. (2007) used a genomewide SNP survey to examine 1,411
individuals with late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD; 104300) and controls,
including 644 carriers of the APOE (107741) E4 allele and 767
noncarriers. The authors found a significant association between AD and
6 SNPs in the GAB2 gene that are part of a common haplotype block.
Maximal significance of the association was at dbSNP rs2373115 with an
odds ratio of 4.06 (uncorrected p value of 9 x 10(-11)). Carriers of the
APOE4 alleles had an even higher disease risk when the SNP risk allele
was present (odds ratio of 24.64) compared to noncarriers.
Neuropathologic studies found that GAB2 was overexpressed in neurons
from AD patients, and the protein was detected in neurons,
tangle-bearing neurons, and dystrophic neurites.

In contrast to the findings of Reiman et al. (2007), both Chapuis et al.
(2008) and Miyashita et al. (2009) failed to detect an association
between dbSNP rs2373115 and risk of developing AD in Caucasian and
Japanese individuals, respectively. Chapuis et al. (2008) studied 3
European Caucasian populations totaling 1,749 AD cases and 1,406
controls, and Miyashita et al. (2009) studied 1,656 Japanese cases and
1,656 Japanese controls; they suggested that GAB2 is, at best, a minor
disease susceptibility gene for AD.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gu et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in Gab2 by homologous
recombination. Gab2 -/- mice were viable and generally healthy; however,
the response of Gab2 -/- mast cells to stimulation of the high affinity
IgE receptor Fc-epsilon-RI (see 147140) was defective. Accordingly,
allergic reactions, such as passive cutaneous and systemic anaphylaxis,
were markedly impaired in Gab -/- mice. Biochemical analyses revealed
that signaling pathways dependent on phosphatidylinositol-3
hydroxykinase (PI3K), a critical component of the Fc-epsilon-RI
signaling, were defective in Gab2 -/- mast cells. Gu et al. (2001)
concluded that GAB2 is the principal activator of PI3K in response to
Fc-epsilon-RI activation, thereby providing genetic evidence that
Dos/Gab family scaffolds regulate the PI3K pathway in vivo.

Wada et al. (2005) found that the bone marrow of Gab2 -/- mice showed
reduced cellularity, and they observed a significant increase in bone
mass in Gab2 -/- mice. Wada et al. (2005) determined that Gab2
deficiency led to decreased bone resorption due to defective osteoclast
differentiation.

605353	TITLE *605353 GHRELIN; GHRL
;;GROWTH HORMONE SECRETAGOGUE RECEPTOR LIGAND;;
MOTILIN-RELATED PEPTIDE
OBESTATIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ghrelin is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue
receptor (GHSR; 601898) and is involved in regulating growth hormone
(GH; 139250) release. Ghrelin is derived from a preprohormone called
preproghrelin, which also generates a second peptide called obestatin
(Zhang et al., 2005). Obestatin is an endogenous ligand for the orphan G
protein-coupled receptor GPR39 (602886) and is involved in satiety and
decreased food intake.

CLONING

Small synthetic molecules called growth hormone secretagogues (GHSs)
stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. They act
through the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, a G protein-coupled
receptor. Kojima et al. (1999) reported the purification and
identification in rat stomach of an endogenous ligand specific for GHSR.
The purified ligand is a peptide of 28 amino acids in which the serine-3
residue is n-octanoylated. The acylated peptide specifically releases GH
both in vivo and in vitro, and O-n-octanoylation at serine-3 is
essential for the activity. Kojima et al. (1999) designated the
GH-releasing peptide 'ghrelin' ('ghre' is the Proto-Indo-European root
of the word 'grow'). Human ghrelin is homologous to rat ghrelin apart
from 2 amino acids. The occurrence of ghrelin in both rat and human
indicates that GH release from the pituitary may be regulated not only
by hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH; 139190), but
also by ghrelin. Human preproghrelin, isolated from a stomach cDNA
library, consists of 117 amino acids. Rat and human preproghrelins are
82.9% identical. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues showed that
preproghrelin mRNA of 0.62 kb occurs in stomach. In situ hybridization
indicated that ghrelin mRNA is found in the region from the neck to the
base of the oxyntic gland. Ghrelin-immunoreactive cells in the stomach
have the same distribution as that found using in situ hybridization.
The distribution pattern and morphologic features of the labeled and
immunostained cells showed that ghrelin cells are endocrine cells.

Kojima et al. (1999) detected a ghrelin transcript in brain by RT-PCR
amplification but not by Northern blot analysis. Immunohistochemical
analyses performed after colchicine treatment revealed that
ghrelin-immunoreactive neurons were localized in the hypothalamic
arcuate nucleus.

Tanaka et al. (2001) cloned a splice variant of mouse ghrelin, which
they called ghrelin gene-derived transcript (GGDT), from adult mouse
testis. The variant encodes a deduced 54-amino acid peptide generated by
alternative exon 1 usage and alternative splicing. Northern blot
analysis showed that GGDT expression is limited to the mouse testis and
is developmentally regulated, being absent in testis at 2 weeks of age
and increasing to reach adult expression levels at 4 weeks of age.
Tanaka et al. (2001) found no significant change in the abundance of
full-length ghrelin mRNA in the stomach from 2 to 8 weeks of age.

- Obestatin

Zhang et al. (2005) searched for orthologs of the human ghrelin gene and
compared preproghrelin sequences from 11 mammalian species. In addition
to the known ghrelin mature peptide, which immediately follows the
signal peptide, they identified another conserved region that was
flanked by potential convertase cleavage sites. This region encoded a
putative 23-amino acid peptide with a flanking conserved glycine residue
at the C terminus, suggesting that it might be amidated. Zhang et al.
(2005) named this ghrelin-associated peptide obestatin, from the Latin
'obedere,' to devour, and 'statin,' denoting suppression.

GENE FUNCTION

Kojima et al. (1999) found that ghrelin circulates in healthy human
blood at a considerable plasma concentration (117.2 +/- 37.2
fmol/ml(-1); n = 6); this, together with the finding that ghrelin, when
injected intravenously, induces GH release, suggested to the authors
that this molecule is produced in and secreted from the stomach,
circulating in the bloodstream to act on the pituitary.

Takaya et al. (2000) studied GH-releasing activity and other effects
generated by ghrelin in 4 normal men aged 28 to 37 years. They
demonstrated that ghrelin strongly stimulates GH release in humans in a
dose-dependent manner. Per mol, ghrelin is more potent for GH release
than GHRH. The lowest dose of ghrelin used (0.2 microg/kg) led to
massive GH release (43.3 +/- 6.0 ng/mL), with minimum effects on ACTH or
PRL (176760). Ghrelin administration did not change serum LH (see
118850), FSH (136530), or TSH (188540) levels.

Kluge et al. (2007) investigated the effect of pulsatile ghrelin
administration on the nocturnal secretion patterns of LH and
testosterone in 10 healthy young men. They found that ghrelin caused
both a delay and suppression of the amplitude of LH pulses. They
concluded that, as in nonhuman mammals, ghrelin may affect the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis predominantly by suppressing
secretion of LH.

Tschop et al. (2000) showed that peripheral daily administration of
ghrelin caused weight gain by reducing fat utilization in mice and rats.
Intracerebroventricular administration of ghrelin generated a
dose-dependent increase in food intake and body weight. Rat serum
ghrelin concentrations were increased by fasting and were reduced by
refeeding or oral glucose administration, but not by water ingestion.
Tschop et al. (2000) proposed that ghrelin, in addition to its role in
regulating GH secretion, signals the hypothalamus when an increase in
metabolic efficiency is necessary.

Nakazato et al. (2001) demonstrated that ghrelin is involved in the
hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis. Intracerebroventricular
injections of ghrelin strongly stimulated feeding in rats and increased
body weight gain. Ghrelin also increased feeding in rats that were
genetically deficient in growth hormone. Antighrelin immunoglobulin G
robustly suppressed feeding. After intracerebroventricular ghrelin
administration, FOS protein (164810), a marker of neuronal activation,
was found in regions of primary importance in the regulation of feeding,
including neuropeptide Y (NPY; 162640) neurons and agouti-related
protein (AGRP; 602311) neurons. Antibodies and antagonists of NPY and
AGRP abolished ghrelin-induced feeding. Ghrelin augmented NPY gene
expression and blocked leptin (LEP; 164160)-induced feeding reduction,
implying that there is a competitive interaction between ghrelin and
leptin in feeding regulation. Nakazato et al. (2001) concluded that
ghrelin is a physiologic mediator of feeding and probably has a function
in growth regulation by stimulating feeding and release of growth
hormone.

Date et al. (2001) demonstrated a role for ghrelin in the central
regulation of gastric function. Specifically, intracerebroventricular
administration of ghrelin stimulated gastric acid secretion in a
dose-dependent and atropine-sensitive manner. Vagotomy abolished gastric
acid secretion. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the induction of Fos
expression in the nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsomotor nucleus
of the rat vagus nerve.

Cummings et al. (2002) investigated plasma ghrelin levels after weight
loss induced by diet or by gastric bypass surgery. They reasoned that if
circulating ghrelin participates in the adaptive response to weight
loss, its levels should rise with dieting. Because ghrelin is produced
primarily in the stomach, weight loss after gastric bypass surgery might
be accompanied by impaired ghrelin secretion. They found an increase in
the plasma ghrelin level with diet-induced weight loss. Gastric bypass
was associated with markedly suppressed ghrelin levels, possibly
contributing to the weight-reducing effect of the procedure.

Leonetti et al. (2003) observed a significant difference in plasma
ghrelin levels between laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP)
and laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB), suggesting
that each procedure could induce weight loss by a different mechanism in
which ghrelin could be involved.

Kojima et al. (2001) reviewed the role of ghrelin. This peptide is found
in the secretory granules of X/A-like cells, a distinct endocrine cell
type found in the submucosal layer of the stomach (Date et al., 2000).
These cells contain round, compact, electron-dense granules and are
filled with ghrelin. Ghrelin immunoreactive cells are also found in the
small and large intestines.

Cowley et al. (2003) discovered expression of ghrelin in a theretofore
uncharacterized group of neurons adjacent to the third ventricle between
the dorsal, ventral, paraventricular, and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei.
These neurons send efferents onto key hypothalamic circuits, including
those producing NPY, AGRP, proopiomelanocortin (POMC; 176830) products,
and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH; 122560). Within the
hypothalamus, ghrelin bound mostly on presynaptic terminals of NPY
neurons. Using electrophysiologic recordings, Cowley et al. (2003) found
that ghrelin stimulated the activity of arcuate NPY neurons and mimicked
the effect of NPY in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.
Cowley et al. (2003) proposed that at these sites, release of ghrelin
may stimulate the release of orexigenic peptides and neurotransmitters,
thus representing a novel regulatory circuit controlling energy
homeostasis.

Abizaid et al. (2006) demonstrated that ghrelin bound to neurons of the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice and rats, where it triggered
increased dopamine neuronal activity, synapse formation, and dopamine
turnover in the nucleus accumbens in a Ghsr-dependent manner. Direct VTA
administration of ghrelin triggered feeding, while intra-VTA delivery of
a selective Ghsr antagonist blocked the orexigenic effect of circulating
ghrelin and blunted rebound feeding following fasting. In addition,
ghrelin- and Ghsr-deficient mice showed attenuated feeding responses to
restricted feeding schedules.

Dixit et al. (2004) demonstrated that ghrelin and its receptor, GHSR,
are expressed in human T lymphocytes and monocytes, where ghrelin acts
via GHSR to inhibit specifically the expression of proinflammatory
anorectic cytokines such as IL1-beta (147720), IL6 (147620), and
TNF-alpha (191160). Ghrelin led to a dose-dependent inhibition of
leptin-induced cytokine expression, whereas leptin upregulated GHSR
expression on human T lymphocytes. Dixit et al. (2004) proposed the
existence of a reciprocal regulatory network by which ghrelin and leptin
control immune cell activation and inflammation. In a murine model of
endotoxemia, Dixit et al. (2004) also showed that ghrelin has potent
antiinflammatory effects and attenuates endotoxin-induced anorexia.

Pagotto et al. (2003) investigated circulating ghrelin levels in a group
of hypogonadal men before and after therapeutic intervention aiming at
normalization of low testosterone concentrations. After the 6-month
replacement testosterone therapy, ghrelin levels of hypogonadal patients
increased and did not differ significantly in comparison with both
control groups. The positive correlation between ghrelin and androgens
still persisted after testosterone replacement therapy, after adjusting
for confounding variables. The authors concluded that androgens modulate
circulating ghrelin concentrations in humans.

Farquhar et al. (2003) measured ghrelin in neonates who were small
(SGA), appropriate (AGA), or large (LGA) for gestational age and
observed that ghrelin concentration was 40% higher in SGA neonates
compared with AGA and LGA neonates. There was a positive correlation
between ghrelin and gestational age in AGA/LGA and a negative
correlation in SGA neonates. The authors suggested that ghrelin may play
a physiologic role in fetal adaptation to intrauterine malnutrition.

To determine whether ghrelin releases GH by a pituitary or a
hypothalamic action, Popovic et al. (2003) compared a group of patients
with organic lesions mainly in the hypothalamic area with matched
controls. Patients showed a severe GH deficiency after hypothalamic
stimulation by insulin tolerance test, but partial response after GHRH
(139190) administration. The authors concluded that when hypothalamic
structures are not operative, ghrelin, either alone or in combination
with GHRH, is not able to significantly release GH. The authors
postulated a hypothalamic point of action for ghrelin-induced GH
secretion.

The studies of Corbetta et al. (2003) suggested that carcinoids and
pancreatic tumors rarely cause ghrelin hypersecretion. However, in this
series, 1 pancreatic ghrelinoma not associated with clinical features of
acromegaly was identified.

After administration of ghrelin, Doi et al. (2006) observed increases in
Ia2-beta (PTPRN2; 601698) in mouse brain, pancreas, and insulinoma cell
lines, but not Ia2 (PTPRN; 601773). Administration of ghrelin or
overexpression of Ia2-beta inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion in insulinoma cells, and inhibition of Ia2-beta overexpression
by RNA interference ameliorated ghrelin's inhibitory effects on
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Doi et al. (2006) suggested that
the inhibitory effects of ghrelin on glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion are at least partly due to increased expression of Ia2-beta
induced by ghrelin.

Leidy et al. (2004) studied the effects of a 3-month energy
deficit-imposing diet and exercise intervention on circulating ghrelin
in healthy women of normal weight. Ghrelin significantly increased over
time in the weight-loss group compared with the controls and the
weight-stable group (P less than 0.05). Changes in ghrelin were
negatively correlated with changes in body weight (r = -0.61; P less
than 0.05). Body fat, body weight, and resting metabolic rate
significantly decreased in the weight-loss group before the increase in
ghrelin. The authors concluded that ghrelin responds in a compensatory
manner to changes in energy homeostasis in healthy young women, and that
ghrelin exhibits particular sensitivity to changes in body weight.

Yang et al. (2008) found that mouse Goat (MBOAT4; 611940) octanoylated
ghrelin following cotransfection of Goat and preproghrelin in cultured
endocrine cell lines. Mutation analysis showed that Goat octanoylated
ghrelin on ser3, a modification required for its endocrine effects.

Checchi et al. (2007) studied the diagnostic use of the measurement of
serum ghrelin compared with other markers of gastric damage in
predicting the presence of atrophic body gastritis (ABG) in patients
with autoimmune gastritis. All 233 patients with autoimmune gastritis
and 211 control subjects were screened for circulating parietal cell
antibodies (PCAs) and were tested for serum ghrelin, gastrin (137250),
pepsinogen I (see 169700) and II (169740), and anti-Helicobacter pylori
antibody levels. A total of 52 patients and 28 control subjects
underwent a gastric endoscopy. In PCA/positive patients, mean serum
ghrelin levels were significantly lower, and mean serum gastrin levels
were significantly higher with respect to PCA/negative patients. Checchi
et al. (2007) concluded that ghrelin secretion is negatively affected by
autoimmune gastritis, and its serum level represents the most sensitive
and specific noninvasive marker for selecting patients at high risk for
ABG.

Andrews et al. (2008) showed that ghrelin initiates robust changes in
hypothalamic mitochondrial respiration in mice that are dependent on
uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2; 601693). Activation of this mitochondrial
mechanism is critical for ghrelin-induced mitochondrial proliferation
and electric activation of NPY (162640)/AgRP (602311) neurons, for
ghrelin-triggered synaptic plasticity of proopiomelanocortin (POMC;
176830)-expressing neurons, and for ghrelin-induced food intake. The
UCP2-dependent action of ghrelin on NPY/AgRP neurons is driven by a
hypothalamic fatty acid oxidation pathway involving AMPK (see 602739),
CPT1 (600528), and free radicals that are scavenged by UCP2. Andrews et
al. (2008) concluded that their results revealed a signaling modality
connecting mitochondria-mediated effects of G protein-coupled receptors
on neuronal function and associated behavior.

In studies in mice lacking Mboat4 and mice overexpressing Mboat4,
Kirchner et al. (2009) demonstrated that Mboat4 is regulated by nutrient
availability, depends on specific dietary lipids as acylation
substrates, and links ingested lipids to energy expenditure and body fat
mass. Kirchner et al. (2009) concluded that ghrelin acylation and the
secretion of acylated ghrelin probably represent 2 independent
processes, and that the ghrelin-MBOAT4 system is a signaling pathway
that alerts the central nervous system to the presence of dietary
calories, rather than to their absence, as had been commonly accepted.

- Role in Prader-Willi Syndrome

To determine whether ghrelin is elevated in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS;
176270), Delparigi et al. (2002) measured fasting plasma ghrelin
concentration, body composition, and subjective ratings of hunger in 7
subjects with PWS and 30 healthy subjects who had fasted overnight. The
mean plasma ghrelin concentration was higher in PWS than in the
reference population and this difference remained significant after
adjustment for percentage of body fat. A positive correlation was found
between plasma ghrelin and subjective ratings of hunger. The authors
concluded that ghrelin is elevated in subjects with PWS. They also
suggested that ghrelin may be responsible, at least in part, for the
hyperphagia observed in PWS.

Haqq et al. (2003) measured fasting serum ghrelin levels in children
with PWS with an average age of 9.5 years and body mass index (BMI) of
31.3 kilograms per square meter. The PWS group was compared with 4
control groups: normal weight controls, obese children, and children
with melanocortin-4 receptor mutations and leptin deficiency. Ghrelin
levels in children with PWS were significantly elevated (3-4 fold)
compared with BMI-matched obese controls. The authors concluded that
elevation of serum ghrelin levels to the degree documented in this study
may play a role as an orexigenic factor driving the insatiable appetite
and obesity found in PWS.

Feigerlova et al. (2008) studied total plasma ghrelin levels in 40
children with PWS and 84 controls from 2 months to 17 years. Plasma
ghrelin levels were higher in children with PWS than controls, both in
the youngest children below 3 years who were not receiving GH (139250)
(771 vs 233 pg/ml, P less than 0.0001) and in the children older than 3
years, all of whom were treated with GH (428 vs 159 pg/ml, P less than
0.0001). The authors concluded that plasma ghrelin levels in children
with PWS are elevated at any age, including during the first years of
life, thus preceding the development of obesity.

- Obestatin

In addition to ghrelin, the preproghrelin peptide also produces
obestatin. Contrary to the appetite-stimulating effects of ghrelin,
Zhang et al. (2005) demonstrated that treatment of rats with obestatin
suppressed food intake, inhibited jejunal contraction, and decreased
body weight gain. Intraperitoneal injection of amidated human obestatin
in adult male mice resulted in suppressed food intake in a time- and
dose-dependent manner. Intracerebroventricular treatment with obestatin
also decreased food intake, similar to the anorexigenic effect of the
synthetic melanocortin (176830) agonist MTII (melanotan-II). In
contrast, treatment with the nonamidated obestatin was less effective.

Chartrel et al. (2007) were unable to reproduce the finding of Zhang et
al. (2005) that obestatin bound to the orphan G protein-coupled receptor
GPR39 (602886). In response to the comments by Chartrel et al. (2007),
Zhang et al. (2007) stated that they also could not reproduce this
finding. However, Zhang et al. (2007) stated that they could reproduce
their original findings on the in vivo effects of obestatin in mice
(decrease in food intake, gastric emptying responses, and body weight
gain) under precise experimental conditions.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Korbonits et al. (2002) studied the ghrelin gene in a group of 70 tall
and obese children. They found 10 SNPs. One common polymorphism of the
ghrelin gene, leu72 to met (L72M; 605353.0002), corresponding to an
amino acid change in the tail of the preproghrelin molecule, was
significantly associated with children with a higher BMI (P = 0.001),
and with lower insulin secretion during the first part of an oral
glucose tolerance test (P = 0.05), although no difference in glucose
levels was noted. The authors concluded that variations in the ghrelin
gene contribute to obesity in children and may modulate glucose-induced
insulin secretion.

Ukkola et al. (2001) reported an arg51-to-gln polymorphism (R51Q;
605353.0001) in the ghrelin gene associated with obesity.

Hinney et al. (2002) screened the ghrelin coding region in 215 extremely
obese German children and adolescents (study group 1) and 93
normal-weight students (study group 2) by single-strand conformation
polymorphism analysis (SSCP). They found 2 previously described SNPs,
R51Q (605353.0001) and L72M (605353.0002), in similar frequencies in
study groups 1 and 2. Hence, they could not confirm the previous
finding. Additionally, 2 novel variants were identified within the
coding region. They detected a nonconservative amino acid change from
gln to leu at codon 90 (605353.0003). They also detected a frameshift
mutation (605353.0004) in 1 healthy normal-weight individual. The
authors concluded that none of the variants seem to influence weight
regulation.

To determine whether mutations in GHRL influence eating behavior and
risk for metabolic syndrome (see 605552), obesity, diabetes, and related
traits, Steinle et al. (2005) genotyped 856 Amish samples for 3 missense
polymorphisms in GHRL, R51Q (605363.0001), L72M (605363.0002) (dbSNP
rs696217), and Q90L (605363.0003) (dbSNP rs4684677) and performed
association analyses with eating behavior traits and metabolic syndrome.
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was lower among those carrying the
51Q allele (3.8 vs 15.8%; age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio = 0.22; P =
0.031). The L72M variant was also associated with increased prevalence
of metabolic syndrome (23.2 vs 13.4%; age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio =
2.57; P = 0.02) as well as higher fasting glucose, lower high density
lipoprotein, and higher triglyceride levels (P = 0.02, P = 0.007, and P
= 0.04, respectively). The 2 variants were not in linkage disequilibrium
with each other, suggesting independent effects. The authors concluded
that mutations in GHRL may confer risk for the metabolic syndrome.

MAPPING

Scott (2000) mapped the human gene encoding ghrelin to 3p26-p25 based on
sequence similarity between the ghrelin precursor (GenBank GENBANK
AB029434) and a BAC (GenBank GENBANK AC008116) mapped to 3p26-p25.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wortley et al. (2004) generated ghrelin-null mice which were viable and
exhibited normal growth rates as well as normal spontaneous food intake
patterns, normal basal levels of hypothalamic orexigenic and
anorexigenic neuropeptides, and no impairment of reflexive hyperphagia
after fasting. Wortley et al. (2004) concluded that endogenous ghrelin
is not an essential regulator of food intake. Analyses of the
ghrelin-null mice demonstrated increased use of fat as a fuel source
when placed on a high-fat diet, indicating that endogenous ghrelin plays
a prominent role in determining the type of metabolic substrate (e.g.,
fat vs carbohydrate) that is used for maintenance of energy balance,
particularly under conditions of high fat intake.

Wortley et al. (2005) demonstrated that male Ghrl-null mice are
protected from the rapid weight gain induced by early exposure to a
high-fat diet; the reduced weight gain was associated with decreased
adiposity and increased energy expenditure and locomotor activity as the
animals aged. Despite the absence of ghrelin, these Ghrl-null mice
showed a paradoxical preservation of the GH/IGF1 (147440) axis. Wortley
et al. (2005) suggested that endogenous ghrelin plays an important role
in the metabolic adaptation to nutrient availability.

Zigman et al. (2005) generated Ghsr (601898)-null mice and observed that
ghrelin administration failed to acutely stimulate food intake or
activate arcuate nucleus neurons. When fed a high-fat diet, both female
and male Ghsr-null mice ate less food, stored less of their consumed
calories, preferentially utilized fat as an energy substrate, and
accumulated less body weight and adiposity than control mice. Ghsr-null
mice also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in both
respiratory quotient and locomotor activity compared to wildtype, and
their blood glucose levels were significantly lower than wildtype mice
of similar weight and body composition. Zigman et al. (2005) concluded
that ghrelin-responsive pathways are an important component of
coordinated body weight control, and suggested that ghrelin signaling is
required for development of the full phenotype of diet-induced obesity.

In rats undergoing chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of ghrelin,
Theander-Carrillo et al. (2006) observed increases in the glucose
utilization rate of white and brown adipose tissue with no effect on
skeletal muscle. In white adipocytes, mRNA expression of various fat
storage-promoting enzymes was markedly increased, whereas mRNA
expression of CPT1A (600528), which controls the rate-limiting step in
fat oxidation, was decreased. In brown adipocytes, central ghrelin
infusion resulted in lowered expression of the thermogenesis-related
mitochondrial UCP1 (113730) and UCP3 (602044). These ghrelin effects
were dose-dependent, occurred independently of ghrelin-induced
hyperphagia, and seemed to be mediated by the sympathetic nervous
system; none of the effects on adipocyte metabolism were observed
following peripheral administration of equal amounts of ghrelin.
Theander-Carrillo et al. (2006) concluded that central ghrelin is of
physiologic relevance in the control of cell metabolism in adipose
tissue.

Dixit et al. (2007) reported that ghrelin and ghrelin receptor
expression within the thymus diminished with progressive aging. Infusion
of ghrelin into 14-month-old mice significantly improved age-associated
changes in thymic architecture and thymocyte numbers, increasing recent
thymic emigrants and improving T cell receptor diversity of peripheral T
cell subsets. Ghrelin-induced thymopoiesis during aging was associated
with enhanced early thymocyte progenitors and bone marrow-derived
hematopoietic stem cells, while Ghrl/Ghsr-deficient mice displayed
accelerated age-associated thymic involution. Leptin (164160) also
enhanced thymopoiesis in aged but not young mice.

Jerlhag et al. (2009) provided evidence that the central ghrelin
signaling system is required for alcohol reward. In mice, central
ghrelin administration to brain ventricles, or to tegmental areas
involved in reward, increased voluntary alcohol intake. Central or
peripheral administration of ghrelin receptor antagonists suppressed
alcohol intake. In addition, suppression of central ghrelin signaling
resulted in blunting of alcohol-induced locomotor stimulation, decreased
dopamine release, and impaired conditioned place preference. These
findings indicated that central ghrelin signaling not only stimulates
the reward system, but is also required for stimulation of that system
by alcohol.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OBESITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
METABOLIC SYNDROME, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
GHRL, ARG51GLN

In 6 of 96 obese (601665) subjects, Ukkola et al. (2001) found a
substitution of gln for arg at codon 51 of preproghrelin (R51Q). This
mutation was caused by a G-to-A transition at codon 346 of the ghrelin
gene, leading to a replacement of arg by gln at the last codon of the
mature ghrelin product, codon 28. This mutation was not found among 96
control subjects. Hinney et al. (2002) found this mutation in similar
frequency among obese and control subjects, however.

In a study examining the relationship between GHRL variants and eating
behavior and risk for metabolic syndrome (see 605552), obesity,
diabetes, and related traits involving 856 Amish participants, Steinle
et al. (2005) found that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was lower
among those carrying the 51Q allele (3.8 vs 15.8%; age- and sex-adjusted
odds ratio = 0.22; P = 0.031).

.0002
OBESITY, AGE AT ONSET OF
METABOLIC SYNDROME, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
GHRL, LEU72MET

Ukkola et al. (2001) found this mutation, a nucleotide 408C-A
transversion resulting in a leu72-to-met (L72M) amino acid change, in 15
obese (601665) (12 heter- and 3 homozygotes) and 12 control subjects.
Among the obese carriers, 12 were heterozygous and 3 homozygous for the
substitution; among the control carriers, all were heterozygotes. This
mutation is outside the coding region for mature ghrelin. The age at
onset of self-reported weight problems tended to be lower among carrier
obese subjects than among those without the polymorphism.

Korbonits et al. (2002) found this SNP (dbSNP rs696217), which they
referred to as SNP247, in heterozygosity in 14 subjects. They noted that
children carrying this polymorphism had a significantly higher Z BMI
compared to those carrying only the wildtype allele, and that the age at
onset of obesity for those carrying this SNP was slightly earlier
(median SNP247 group 2.0 years, wildtype group 3.5 years; P = 0.036).

Hinney et al. (2002) identified this variant in both extremely obese
children and adolescents and normal-weight students.

In a study examining the relationship between GHRL variants and eating
behavior and risk for metabolic syndrome (see 605552), obesity,
diabetes, and related traits involving 856 Amish participants, Steinle
et al. (2005) found that the L72M variant was associated with increased
prevalence of metabolic syndrome (23.2 vs 13.4%; age- and sex-adjusted
odds ratio = 2.57; P = 0.02) as well as higher fasting glucose, lower
high density lipoprotein, and higher triglyceride levels (P = 0.02, P =
0.007, and P = 0.04, respectively).

.0003
OBESITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
GHRL, GLN90LEU

Hinney et al. (2002) identified a novel variant in the ghrelin gene, an
A-to-T transversion that led to a nonconservative amino acid change from
gln to leu at codon 90 (Q90L; dbSNP rs4684677). The frequency of the
leu90 allele was significantly higher in the extremely obese (601665)
children and adolescents than in the normal-weight students.
Additionally, they genotyped 134 underweight students and 44
normal-weight adults for this SNP. Genotype frequencies were similar in
extremely obese children and adolescents, underweight students, and
normal-weight adults.

.0004
GHRELIN POLYMORPHISM
GHRL, 2-BP DEL, CODON 34

In a healthy normal-weight individual, Hinney et al. (2002) identified a
2-bp deletion at codon 34 of ghrelin leading to the insertion of 36
aberrant amino acids and a stop codon at position 71. This variant
affects the coding region of mature ghrelin; presumably, this individual
is haploinsufficient for ghrelin.

605493	TITLE *605493 TRIPARTITE MOTIF-CONTAINING 3; TRIM3
;;RING FINGER PROTEIN 22; RNF22;;
BRAIN-EXPRESSED RING FINGER; BERP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

El-Husseini and Vincent (1999) screened rat cerebellar mRNA for
nucleotide-binding proteins. Using the resulting RT-PCR product as a
probe to screen a rat brain cDNA library, they isolated a novel ring
finger cDNA, Rnf22, which they designated Berp. Berp encodes a member of
the RBCC subgroup of RING finger proteins characterized by 3 motifs: an
N-terminal ring finger, a B-box zinc finger, and a coiled-coil domain.
The rat Berp protein contains a 130-amino acid region that is 41%
identical to a repeat domain present in actin-binding proteins. Its C
terminus contains 6 repeats that are predicted to form a circular
beta-propeller similar to that in WD and kelch proteins. Northern blot
analysis detected highest expression of Berp in cerebellum, with weaker
expression in other brain regions as well as in lung, liver, kidney, and
heart. Using a yeast 2-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation
experiments, Berp was expressed in cytoplasm with a punctate pattern
similar to that of endogenous myosin Va (MYO5A; 160777), a pattern
characteristic of organelle-associated proteins.

Using rat Berp to screen a hippocampus cDNA library, followed by EST
database analysis and RT-PCR of cerebellar total RNA, El-Husseini et al.
(2001) cloned human BERP. The deduced 744-amino aid protein has an
N-terminal RING finger, followed by B-box motifs, a coiled-coil domain,
a putative actin-binding protein-like beta-sheet structure, and a
predicted C-terminal 6-blade beta-propeller domain. Human BERP shares
98% amino acid identity with rat and mouse Berp and about 30% identity
with the putative C. elegans ortholog. Northern blot analysis detected a
major 3-kb transcript in human brain. EST database analysis suggested
that BERP is also expressed in breast, heart, uterus, and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

El-Husseini and Vincent (1999) demonstrated that the RBCC domain of rat
BERP could homodimerize. Additionally, the C-terminal repeats of Berp
interacted with class V myosins. El-Husseini and Vincent (1999)
hypothesized that BERP may mediate interactions with various proteins,
allowing cargo transport via a myosin V-mediated pathway. BERP
interactions with class V myosins may also be important in organelle
transport and neurite outgrowth.

El-Husseini et al. (2000) demonstrated interaction between the RBCC
domain of rat BERP and a rat brain cDNA for a nonmuscle isoform of
alpha-actinin, Actn4 (604638). Using immunohistochemistry, El-Husseini
et al. (2000) showed that both Berp and Actn4 were expressed in a
punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm and neuritic processes of
differentiated PC12 cells. They concluded that BERP may serve to anchor
class V myosin to particular cell domains via its interaction with
ACTN4.

Using mutation analysis and reporter gene assays, Cheung et al. (2010)
found that only 1 of 4 putative p53 (TP53; 191170)-binding sites in the
promoter region of human BERP activated BERP expression. Similarly,
treatment with pentylenetetrazol upregulated Berp expression in p53 +/+
mouse hippocampal neurons, but not in p53 -/- hippocampal neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

El-Husseini et al. (2001) determined that the TRIM3 gene contains 11
coding exons.

Cheung et al. (2010) identified a functional p53-binding site within
intron 1 of the TRIM3 gene.

MAPPING

Using FISH, El-Husseini et al. (2001) mapped the TRIM3 gene to
chromosome 11p15.5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cheung et al. (2010) found that Berp -/- mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio and were viable, healthy, and fertile, with no gross or
histologic abnormalities. Berp -/- mice were more resistant to
pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures than wildtype mice. Patch-clamp
recordings showed that cortical neurons from Berp -/- mice exhibited
reduced mean miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current frequency and
amplitude compared with wildtype neurons, which appeared to be due to
reduced surface expression of the Gabrg2 (137164) GABA receptor subunit.
Gabrg2 mRNA content was not altered in Berp -/- neurons.

306250	TITLE *306250 COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR 2 RECEPTOR, ALPHA; CSF2RA
;;GRANULOCYTE-MACROPHAGE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR RECEPTOR, LOW AFFINITY,
ALPHA SUBUNIT; GMCSFR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF, or CSF2;
138960) activates STAT5 (601511) and other signaling pathways via
binding to a cell surface receptor composed of a ligand-binding alpha
subunit, encoded by CSF2RA, and a nonbinding affinity-enhancing beta
subunit, encoded by CSF2RB (138981) (Suzuki et al., 2008).

CLONING

Using an expression cloning strategy, Gearing et al. (1989) isolated a
cDNA encoding CSF2RA, which they called GMCSFR, from a human placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 400-amino acid precursor protein has a
22-amino acid signal peptide. The 378-amino acid mature protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 43.7 kD and contains a single transmembrane
domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain, and a short
intracytoplasmic tail. Northern blot analysis detected GMCSFR expression
in a variety of hemopoietic cells displaying GMCSF binding.

Raines et al. (1991) identified a truncated, soluble form of the
low-affinity GMCSF receptor in choriocarcinoma cells. Clones encoding
the soluble receptor were identical in sequence to the membrane-bound
form except for a 97-nucleotide deletion. The amino acid sequence of
this deleted cDNA predicted a protein that lacks the 84 C-terminal amino
acids of the membrane-bound receptor, including the transmembrane and
cytoplasmic domains, and contains 16 different amino acids at its C
terminus. RNase protection analysis indicated that this variant cDNA was
derived from a naturally occurring mRNA. Soluble receptors had been
identified for several other hematopoietin receptors and may be a
general feature of this class. It is likely that alternative mRNA
splicing is the mechanism by which the soluble counterparts are
generated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rappold et al. (1992) found that the CSF2RA gene spans at least 45 kb.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of a panel of mouse-human somatic cell
hybrids, Gough et al. (1990) demonstrated that the CSF2R gene is on the
X chromosome. The possibility that an allele also maps to the Y
chromosome was suggested by the observation that many DNA samples from
normal males carry 2 alleles of this gene. Among 65 normal persons, 23
females and 20 males were homozygous for an allele of fragment A,
whereas 8 females and 14 males were heterozygous. By in situ
hybridization, Gough et al. (1990) showed that the CSF2R gene maps to
the tip of the short arm of the X chromosome and the short arm of the Y
chromosome (see 425000), with the most likely localization being
Xpter-p21 and Ypter-p11.2. Although this information was consistent with
its location in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), conclusive proof
required study of segregation of the locus with respect to sexual
phenotype. They found in a total of 14 informative male meioses, 3
recombination events; i.e., in 2 cases a daughter had inherited the
allele from the paternal Y chromosome, and in 1 instance a son had
inherited the allele from the paternal X chromosome. Thus, the CSF2R
locus is distal to the MIC2 locus (313470), which shows only about 2.5%
recombination and maps close to the PAR boundary. This was the first
localization of a gene of known function to this region, which
encompasses about 2,500 kb.

By pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Rappold et al. (1992) localized the
CSF2RA gene 1,180 to 1,300 kb from the telomere, in close proximity to
the CpG island B5. The gene showed abundant hypervariable sequences, and
a number of informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms were
defined. Rappold et al. (1992) suggested that these polymorphisms might
be useful in proving the pseudoautosomal inheritance of apparently
autosomal traits, as has been suggested for schizophrenia (Crow, 1988),
cerebral dominance (Crow, 1989), and Kabuki make-up syndrome (Niikawa et
al., 1988; 147920), among others.

Rappold (1993) discussed in detail the pseudoautosomal regions that
exist at the tips of the short and long arms of the X and Y chromosomes
and cover 2.6 and 0.4 Mb, respectively.

By both in situ hybridization and linkage analysis, Disteche et al.
(1992) found that the murine Csf2ra gene maps to chromosome 19.

GENE FUNCTION

DiPersio et al. (1988) studied the binding of GMCSF, over a wide range
of concentrations, to normal human peripheral blood cells, bone marrow,
acute and chronic myeloid leukemia cells, and a number of established
human myeloid and nonmyeloid cell lines; thereby, they defined the
receptors.

Gearing et al. (1989) found that transfection of GMCSFR cDNA into COS
cells directed expression of a GMCSF receptor showing a single class of
affinity and specificity for human GMCSF, but not interleukin-3 (IL3;
147740).

Hayashida et al. (1990) showed that the high-affinity GMCSF receptor is
composed of at least 2 components in a manner analogous to the IL2
receptor (see 147730). They proposed to designate the low-affinity GMCSF
receptor as the alpha subunit, and the 'new' protein that they
identified and called KH97 as the beta subunit (see 138981). The 2
subunits are approximately 80 and 120 kD, respectively.

Raines et al. (1991) found that expression of the variant cDNA encoding
the truncated, soluble CSF2R isoform produced a secreted protein that
retained its capacity to bind CSF2 in solution.

Kondo et al. (2000) showed that a clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor,
a bone marrow-resident cell that gives rise exclusively to lymphocytes
(T, B, and natural killer cells), can be redirected to the myeloid
lineage by stimulation through exogenously expressed interleukin-2
receptor (146710) and GMCSF receptor. Analysis of mutants of the
beta-chain of the IL2 receptor revealed that the granulocyte and
monocyte differentiation signals are triggered by different cytoplasmic
domains, showing that the signaling pathways responsible for these
unique developmental outcomes are separable. Finally, Kondo et al.
(2000) showed that the endogenous myelomonocytic cytokine receptors for
GMCSF and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1R; 164770) are
expressed at low to moderate levels on the more primitive hematopoietic
stem cells, are absent on common lymphoid progenitors, and are
upregulated after myeloid lineage induction by IL2 (147680). Kondo et
al. (2000) concluded that cytokine signaling can regulate cell fate
decisions and proposed that a critical step in lymphoid commitment is
downregulation of cytokine receptors that drive myeloid cell
development.

Loss of either the X or the Y chromosome is apparent in 25% of acute
myeloid leukemias of the M2 subtype (AML-M2), compared with only 1 to 6%
in other AML subtypes, suggesting the involvement of a 'recessive
oncogene' in the genesis of M2 AMLs. The presumed gene is likely to be
in the PAR, because if it were located in the portion of the X
chromosome not shared with the Y, then similar loss of the Y chromosome
would not be predicted, and vice versa. Gough et al. (1990) suggested
that CSF2R may be the gene in question. Loss or inactivation of both
copies of the gene in a myeloid progenitor cell would be expected to
result in a clone of cells unable to respond to GMCSF, and hence in the
relatively undifferentiated phenotype of the M2 form of leukemia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder in which
surfactant-derived lipoproteins accumulate excessively within pulmonary
alveoli, causing severe respiratory distress. It is a disorder of
surfactant metabolism. The importance of CSF2 in the pathogenesis of PAP
has been confirmed in humans and mice, wherein CSF2 signaling is
required for pulmonary alveolar macrophage catabolism of surfactant.
Using flow cytometry, Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) found that
CSF2RA was absent on monocytes from a 4-year-old girl with PAP due to
pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction (SMDP4; 300770). The
patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas the
patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation of
monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 induced upregulation of
CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the patient. Karyotypic
analysis showed that the patient had 1 X chromosome of apparently normal
length and 1 X chromosome with a truncated Xp arm that did not hybridize
with a PAR1 probe. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in
leukocytes from the patient's family members, but not in those from the
patient. PCR analysis of the 11 coding exons of the CSF2RA gene revealed
a deletion of exons 5 through 13 (306250.0001) in the patient's DNA,
providing a genetic basis for the absence of CSF2RA mRNA and protein.

Using flow cytometry, Suzuki et al. (2008) found that both CSF2RA and
CSF2RB were present on leukocytes from 2 sisters with PAP, as well as
all family members tested. However, Western blot analysis showed that
the affected sisters expressed only a truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas
their father was heterozygous for the normal and truncated forms, and
their mother expressed only normal CSF2RA. CSF2 binding and
CSF2-dependent signaling were severely reduced, but not abolished, in
the sisters, and their CD11B stimulation test was abnormal. Suzuki et
al. (2008) identified a mutation in the CSF2RA gene in the affected
sisters that resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R; 306250.0002)
substitution. The father was heterozygous for the G174R mutation, but
the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed that CSF2RA
copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but not in the
father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of PAR1, including
the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome of the sisters and mother. Suzuki et
al. (2008) concluded that PAP may be caused by compound heterozygous
abnormalities affecting the CSF2RA gene, and that CSF2 signaling is
critical for surfactant homeostasis in humans.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schweizerhof et al. (2009) presented evidence that GCSF (CSF3; 138970)
and GMCSF mediate bone cancer pain and tumor-nerve interactions.
Increased levels of both factors were detected in bone marrow lysates
and adjoining connective tissue in a mouse sarcoma model of bone
tumor-induced pain compared to controls. The functional receptors GCSFR
(CSF3R; 138971) and GMCSFR were expressed on peripheral nerves in the
bone matrix and in dorsal root ganglia. GMCSF sensitized nerves to
mechanical stimuli in vitro and in vivo, potentiated CGRP (114130)
release, and caused sprouting of sensory nerve endings in the skin. RNA
interference of GCSF and GMCSF signaling in the mouse sarcoma model led
to reduced tumor growth and nerve remodeling, and abrogated bone cancer
pain.

CSF2RA, EX5-13 DEL

In a 4-year-old girl with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (300770),
Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) identified a deletion of exons 5
through 13 in the CSF2RA gene. Karyotypic analysis showed that the
patient's other X chromosome had a truncated Xp arm that did not
hybridize with a probe for pseudoautosomal region-1, which contains
CSF2RA. The patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas
the patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation
of monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 (1389060) induced
upregulation of CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the
patient. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in leukocytes
from the patient's family members, but not in those from the patient.

SURFACTANT METABOLISM DYSFUNCTION, PULMONARY, 4
CSF2RA, GLY174ARG

Suzuki et al. (2008) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the
CSF2RA gene in genomic DNA from 2 sisters with pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis (300770), one 6 years of age and the other 8 years of age.
The mutation resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R) substitution that
altered 1 of 11 potential N-glycosylation sites in the CSF2RA protein.
Western blot analysis showed that the affected sisters expressed only a
truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas their father was heterozygous for the
normal and truncated forms, and their mother expressed only normal
CSF2RA. CSF2 (138960) binding and CSF2-dependent signaling were severely
reduced, but not abolished, in the sisters, and their CD11B (120980)
stimulation test was abnormal. The father was heterozygous for the G174R
mutation, but the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed
that CSF2RA copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but
not in the father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of
pseudoautosomal region-1, including the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome
of the sisters and mother. Transfection of CSF2RA with the G174R
mutation into 293 cells reproduced the CSF2 signaling defect at
physiologic CSF2 concentrations. At high CSF2 concentrations, similar to
those observed in the index patient, signaling was partially rescued,
thereby providing a molecular explanation for the slow disease
progression in the 2 sisters.

600727	TITLE *600727 NUCLEAR FACTOR I/A; NFIA
;;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NFIA;;
KIAA1439
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nuclear factor I (NFI) proteins, such as NFIA, constitute a family of
dimeric DNA-binding proteins with similar, and possibly identical,
DNA-binding specificity. They function as cellular transcription factors
and as replication factors for adenovirus DNA replication. Diversity in
this protein family is generated by multiple genes, differential
splicing, and heterodimerization (summary by Qian et al., 1995).

CLONING

Qian et al. (1995) isolated partial cDNA sequences derived from 4
independent genes: NFIA, NFIB (600728), NFIC (600729), and NFIX
(164005).

By sequencing clones obtained from an adult brain cDNA library, Nagase
et al. (2000) cloned NFIA, which they designated KIAA1439. The deduced
protein contains 561 amino acids and shares complete sequence identity
with rat nuclear factor-1 over 509 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
moderate to high expression in all tissues examined. Highest expression
was detected in heart and liver, followed by brain, lung, ovary,
skeletal muscle, kidney, testis, fetal liver, fetal brain, pancreas, and
spleen. NFIA was expressed at moderate to high levels in all adult brain
regions tested, with highest expression in cerebellum and caudate
nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grunder et al. (2003) determined that the NFIA gene contains 11 exons.
By ortholog comparisons using protein sequences from 7 vertebrate
species, they identified 12 NFIA variants that are produced by
alternative splicing.

MAPPING

By FISH, Qian et al. (1995) mapped the NFIA and NFIB genes to
chromosomes 1p31.3-p31.2 and 9p24.1, respectively. They localized the
NFIC and NFIX genes to chromosome 19p13.3 in the order
cen--NFIX--NFIC--tel. Comparison of the position of NFI genes and JUN
genes (see JUNB, 165161) revealed a close physical linkage between
members of the NFI and JUN gene families in the human genome.

By FISH, Grunder et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Nfia and Nfib genes to
chromosome 4C4-C6.

GENE FUNCTION

Deneen et al. (2006) found that Nfia and Nfib were induced in the spinal
cord ventricular zone of mouse embryos concomitant with induction of
Glast (SLC1A3; 600111), a marker of gliogenesis. Using mouse and chicken
embryos and embryonic rat cortical progenitor cells, they showed that
Nfia and Nfib were necessary and sufficient to promote glial cell fate
specification. At later embryonic stages, Nfia and Nfib promoted
terminal astrocyte differentiation. Nfia also inhibited neurogenesis in
ventricular zone progenitors.

Rosa et al. (2007) identified a pathway by which PU.1 (SPI1; 165170)
regulated human monocyte/macrophage differentiation. PU.1 activated
transcription of MIR424 (300682), which translationally repressed NFIA,
resulting in activation of differentiation-specific genes, such as MCSFR
(CSF1R; 164770).

regulated human monocyte/macrophage differentiation. PU.1 activated
transcription of MIR424 (300682), which translationally repressed NFIA,
resulting in activation of differentiation-specific genes, such as MCSFR
(CSF1R; 164770).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lu et al. (2007) reported 5 patients, including 2 half sibs, with
balanced translocations or interstitial deletions of chromosome 1q31-q32
(613735) involving the NFIA gene confirmed by FISH and Southern blot
analysis. Three of the patients had been previously reported by Campbell
et al. (2002) and Shanske et al. (2004). The 2 half sibs had a 12-Mb
deletion involving approximately 47 additional genes, and another
patient had a 12-Mb deletion of chromosome 2q encompassing 39 additional
genes, as well as a translocation involving chromosome 1p. The remaining
2 patients had a translocation with a microdeletion and a translocation,
respectively. All 5 showed a similar phenotype characterized by
hypoplastic or absent corpus callosum, hydrocephalus or
ventriculomegaly, and developmental delay. Four patients had a tethered
spinal cord, 3 had Chiari type I malformation, and 3 had seizures. In
addition, 3 patients had urinary tract defects, including vesicoureteral
reflux and urinary incontinence. Although all 5 cases had
haploinsufficiency of NFIA, each case also had involvement of 1 or more
additional genes, which may have contributed to the phenotype.
Intragenic mutations in the NFIA gene were not identified in any of the
patients or in 219 additional patients with various neurologic
developmental abnormalities. Lu et al. (2007) noted the phenotypic
similarities to Nfia loss of function in the mouse and suggested that
haploinsufficiency of the NFIA gene contributed to the malformation
syndrome in these patients.

ANIMAL MODEL

Das Neves et al. (1999) found that disruption of the mouse Nfia gene
caused perinatal lethality. More than 95% of Nfia null animals died
within 2 weeks after birth. Newborn animals lacked a corpus callosum and
showed ventricular dilation indicating early hydrocephalus. Rare
surviving homozygous mice lacked a corpus callosum, showed severe
communicating hydrocephalus, a full-axial tremor indicative of
neurologic defects, male sterility, and low female fertility, but they
had near normal life spans.

612465	TITLE *612465 TBC1 DOMAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 4; TBC1D4
;;AKT SUBSTRATE, 160-KD; AS160;;
KIAA0603
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned TBC1D4, which they designated
KIAA0603. The deduced 1,299-amino acid protein shares significant
similarity with mouse Tbc1 (TBC1D1; 609850), suggesting a role in cell
signaling and communication. RT-PCR analysis detected TBC1D4 expression
in all tissues examined, with highest levels in kidney, skeletal muscle,
ovary, and heart.

Matsumoto et al. (2004) reported that the TBC1D4 protein contains 2
N-terminal phosphotyrosine interaction domains and a C-terminal TBC
domain. The region containing the TBC domain shares 31% homology with
human RAB GTPase-activating protein-1 (RABGAP1). A C-terminal region
containing most of the TBC domain of TBC1D4 was predicted to have a
tertiary structure similar to the GTPase-activating site structure of
yeast Gyp1, suggesting that arg973 is essential to the GTPase-activating
site of TBC1D4. Northern blot analysis detected a 6-kb transcript in
several tissues, with highest expression in heart and skeletal muscle. A
5-kb transcript was also observed in placenta and several immune
tissues, including spleen, lymph node, and leukocyte.

Using Northern blot analysis, Kurihara et al. (2002) showed that mouse
Tbc1d4 was expressed at low levels at embryonic days 7 and 11, but that
expression increased at embryonic days 15 and 17. In adult mice, Tbc1d4
was detected at variable levels in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Using differential display analysis and RT-PCR, Matsumoto et al. (2004)
found that TBC1D4 was upregulated in peripheral blood CD3 (see
186740)-positive cells from atopic dermatitis (AD; see 603165) patients
compared with normal control cells. Expression was highest in
CD3-positive cells from patients with moderate pathology. Among
leukocyte subsets from 5 healthy subjects, TBC1D4 expression was highest
in T cells, particularly CD4 (186940)-positive/CD45RO (151460)-positive
memory T cells. TBC1D4 expression was transiently upregulated following
in vitro stimulation of T cells with anti-CD3 antibodies or calcium
mobilization.

In muscle and fat cells, insulin (INS; 176730) stimulation activates a
signaling cascade that causes intracellular vesicles containing glucose
transporter-4 (GLUT4, or SLC2A4; 138190) to translocate to and fuse with
the plasma membrane. Using mass spectrometry, Larance et al. (2005)
identified AS160, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP, or LNPEP;
151300), Rab10 (612672), Rab11 (see RAB11A; 605570), and Rab14 (612673)
on Glut4 vesicles from cultured mouse adipocytes. Association of As160
with Glut4 vesicles was mediated in part by direct interaction with the
cytosolic tail of membrane-bound Irap. The As160-Irap interaction was
insulin dependent, and As160 dissociated from Glut4 vesicles with
insulin exposure. Knockdown of As160 expression via small interfering
RNA led to increased levels of Glut4 at the plasma membrane in the basal
state.

Miinea et al. (2005) stated that phosphorylation of AS160 in adipocytes
by AKT (see AKT1; 164730) is required for insulin-stimulated
translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. They found that the
purified recombinant GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain of human
AS160 showed GAP activity with RAB2A (RAB2; 179509), RAB8A (165040),
RAB10, and RAB14, but not with 14 other RABs. Immunoblot analysis showed
that these RABs associated with Glut4-positive vesicles in mouse
adipocytes. Mutation of arg673 to leu inactivated AS160. Miinea et al.
(2005) concluded that AK160 functions as a RAB GAP and that RABs may
participate in GLUT4 translocation.

Karlsson et al. (2005) found that expression of AS160 protein was
similar in muscle biopsy samples from 9 control subjects and from 10
patients with type-2 diabetes (125853). However, phosphorylation of
AS160 in response to physiologic hyperinsulinemia was reduced 39% (p
less than 0.05) in diabetic samples compared with controls. Impaired
AS160 phosphorylation with diabetes was related to aberrant AKT
signaling. Phosphorylation on thr308 of AKT was impaired 51% (p less
than 0.05) in type-2 diabetic samples compared with controls, whereas
phosphorylation on ser473 of AKT was not significantly reduced. Karlsson
et al. (2005) concluded that physiologic hyperinsulinemia increases
AS160 phosphorylation in normal human skeletal muscle, and they
suggested that defects in insulin action on AS160 may impair GLUT4
trafficking in type-2 diabetes.

Bouzakri et al. (2008) found that human and mouse pancreatic beta cells
expressed AS160 and that AS160 was phosphorylated after glucose
stimulation. AS160 mRNA expression was downregulated in pancreatic
islets from individuals with type-2 diabetes. In mouse insulin-secreting
cells, glucose induced phosphorylation of Akt and As160, and this was
mediated by insulin receptor (INSR; 147670), Irs2 (600797), and PI3
kinase (see 601232) independently of changes in cytosolic Ca(2+).
Knockdown of AS160 in mouse cells increased basal insulin secretion, but
it abolished glucose-stimulated insulin release. As160 knockdown also
increased apoptosis and loss of glucose-induced proliferation. Bouzakri
et al. (2008) concluded that AS160 is a major effector of insulin
signaling in pancreatic beta cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kurihara et al. (2002) determined that the 5-prime ends of the mouse and
human TBC1D4 genes contain a conserved CpG island.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the TBC1D4
gene to chromosome 13. By genomic sequence analysis, Kurihara et al.
(2002) mapped the TBC1D4 gene to chromosome 13q22. They mapped the mouse
Tbc1d4 gene to a syntenic region of chromosome 14.

613666	TITLE *613666 ALG11, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; ALG11
;;ASPARAGINE-LINKED GLYCOSYLATION 11, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF;;
KIAA0266
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ALG11 is a mannosyltransferase that uses GDP-mannose to sequentially add
the fourth and fifth mannose residues to growing dolichol-linked
oligosaccharide side chains at the outer leaflet of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). Upon completion, the lipid-linked polyoligosaccharides
are translocated to the ER lumen for subsequent transfer to substrate
asparagine residues of newly synthesized glycoproteins (Rind et al.,
2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated KG-1 immature
myeloid cell line, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned ALG11, which they
designated KIAA0266. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its
3-prime end, and the deduced protein contains 766 amino acids. Northern
blot analysis revealed low and uniform expression of ALG11 in all human
tissues and cell lines examined.

Rind et al. (2010) predicted that human ALG11 contains 2 Rossmann-like
type B domains, which are separated by a catalytic flexible hinge
region, and a conserved C-terminal nucleotide sugar-binding region.
ALG11 also has 2 predicted transmembrane domains and 2 putative
N-glycosylation sites. Immunofluorescence analysis of human fibroblasts
revealed colocalization of ALG11 with an ER marker, calnexin (CANX;
114217).

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the ALG11 gene
to chromosome 13. Hartz (2010) mapped the ALG11 gene to chromosome
13q14.3 based on an alignment of the ALG11 sequence (GenBank GENBANK
AK025456) with the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 Turkish sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with congenital
disorder of glycosylation type Ip (CDG1P; 613661), Rind et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous mutation (L86S; 613666.0001) in the ALG11 gene.
The phenotype was a multisystem metabolic disorder characterized by
hypotonia, seizures, developmental retardation, deafness, and death by
age 2 years. One affected child showed mild dysmorphic features.

In 3 unrelated patients with CDG1P, Thiel et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in the ALG11 gene
(613666.0002-613666.0006). All mutations occurred in conserved residues,
and the cellular biochemical defects could be rescued by retroviral
complementation with wildtype ALG11. Glucose starvation prior to
metabolic labeling of patient-derived fibroblasts was a crucial step for
the correct biochemical diagnosis.

In 2 Turkish sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with congenital
disorder of glycosylation type Ip (CDG1P; 613661), Rind et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 257T-C transition in exon 2 of the ALG11 gene,
resulting in a leu86-to-ser (L86S) substitution in a highly conserved
region in the N terminus between 2 hydrophobic helices at the end of a
glycine-rich motif. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 100 control alleles. Introduction of
wildtype ALG11 in patient fibroblasts and yeast deficient in the enzyme
complemented the biochemical abnormality. Immunofluorescent studies
showed that the mutation did not affect protein localization and did not
appear to affect the stability of the mannosyltransferase complex.
However, studies in yeast showed that the mutant L86S protein had some
residual activity, but not as much as wildtype, suggesting that it is a
leaky mutation.

In a 7-year-old girl with CDG1P (613661), Thiel et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ALG11 gene: an 18-bp
deletion (623_642) resulting in a frameshift and premature truncation
after 210 amino acids, and an 836A-C transversion resulting in a
tyr279-to-ser (Y279S; 613666.0003) substitution. The patient had
developmental delay, mental retardation, axial hypotonia, slight
peripheral hypertonia, no communication and poor social interaction,
seizures, and strabismus. Neither mutation was found in 120 control
alleles. Biochemical analysis showed a CDG type I pattern. However, the
pathologic glycosylation phenotype was only apparent after glucose
starvation in patient fibroblasts; then, analysis of dolichol-linked
oligosaccharides led to the emergence of pathologic shortened
intermediate dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, indicating a defect in
biosynthesis which could be rescued by retroviral complementation with
wildtype ALG11.

and a 1192G-A transition resulting in a glu398-to-lys (E398K;

retardation, central hypotonia, peripheral hypertonia, no communication,
and seizures. Other anomalies included dystrophic facial features with
high forehead, long philtrum, and retrognathia, dry scaly skin,
oscillation of body temperature, inverted nipples, fat pads, and

;;HERMES ANTIGEN;;
Pgp1;;

INLU-RELATED p80 GLYCOPROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD44 is an integral cell membrane glycoprotein with a postulated role in
matrix adhesion lymphocyte activation and lymph node homing (Aruffo et
al., 1990).

CLONING

Telen et al. (1983) used a murine monoclonal antibody (A3D8) to identify
an erythrocyte antigen inhibited by the In(Lu) gene. Telen et al. (1984)
showed that the A3D8 antigenic property resides on an 80-kD red cell
membrane protein which is present in only trace amounts in In(Lu)
Lu(a-b-) red cells (INLU; 111150). Haynes (1986) had evidence that the
A1G3 and A3D8 monoclonal antibodies bind to different epitopes on the
same 80-kD molecule. The monoclonal antibody A3D8 recognized an antigen
officially called MDU3, for 'monoclonal Duke University, 3,' or CD44.
Telen (1992) knew of no evidence that the INLU and CD44 (MDU3) genes are
the same.

By screening cDNA libraries prepared from hemopoietic cell lines,
Stamenkovic et al. (1989) isolated CD44 clones. Immunoprecipitation of
CD44 from transfected COS cells and cultured cell lines detected
cell-specific expression of an 80- to 90-kD protein and a 160-kD
protein. Several minor forms of 52 to 200 kD were variably present in
different cell types. RNA blot analysis revealed transcripts of 1.6,
2.2, and 5.0 kb in hemopoietic cell lines. RNA blot analysis of
carcinoma cell lines revealed 3 patterns of expression: the first,
exemplified by melanoma cell lines, was identical to the hemopoietic
cell pattern associated with the 80- to 90-kD isoform; the second,
exemplified by a colon carcinoma cell line, showed transcripts of 2.0,
2.6, and 5.6 kb associated with the 160-kD isoform; and the third,
exemplified by another colon carcinoma cell line, was a composite of the
first 2 patterns. All primary carcinoma specimens examined showed
prevalent CD44 transcripts of either hemopoietic or composite type. The
CD44 cDNA encodes a 361-amino acid protein with a 20-residue secretory
signal peptide, a 248-residue extracellular N-terminal domain with
multiple N- and O-linked glycosylation sites, a 21-amino acid
transmembrane domain, and a 72-residue hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain.
The mature protein has a calculated molecular mass of 37 kD. Sequence
analysis suggested homology with chicken and rat cartilage link proteins
(HAPLN1; 115435).

Stefanova et al. (1989) demonstrated that the lymphocyte homing receptor
is identical to the human leukocyte surface glycoprotein called CDw44,
on the basis of studies at the Third International Workshop on Human
Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens. It also appears to be identical to
the Pgp-1 glycoprotein of Omary et al. (1988).

GENE FAMILY

A table of all the CD antigens was provided by Schlossman et al. (1994)
with a list of the common names, the size in kilodaltons, and the nature
of the protein (adhesion, myeloid, platelet, and B cell, T cell, etc.).

GENE STRUCTURE

Screaton et al. (1992) found that the CD44 gene contains 19 exons
spanning 50 kb of genomic DNA. They identified 10 alternatively spliced
exons within the extracellular domain, including 1 exon that had not
previously been reported. In addition to the inclusion or exclusion of
whole exons, additional diversity was generated through the utilization
of internal splice donor and acceptor sites within 2 of the exons. A
variation in the cytoplasmic domain was shown to result from the
alternative splicing of 2 exons. Thus the genomic structure of CD44 is
remarkably complex, and alternative splicing is the basis of its
structural and functional diversity.

Nedvetzki et al. (2003) noted that human CD44 isoforms are generated
from 9 variant exons (v2 to v10) inserted in different combinations
between 2 constant regions consisting of 5 exons at the N terminus and 4
exons at the C terminus (constant exon 19 is noncoding). Direct splicing
of constant exon 5 to constant exon 16, thereby skipping the variant
exons, generates the standard CD44 isoform.

GENE FUNCTION

Aruffo et al. (1990) demonstrated that CD44 is the main cell surface
receptor for hyaluronate. Mature lymphocytes in the circulation migrate
selectively from the bloodstream to different lymphatic tissues through
specialized high endothelial venules (HEV). Molecules on the surface of
lymphocytes called homing receptors interact specifically with HEV and
play a central role in the migration.

Splice variants of the glycoprotein CD44 may be associated with
metastases and therefore may be useful in the early detection of
metastatic potential in surgical biopsy specimens, as well as in the
early diagnosis of cancer in screening programs, assessment of remaining
disease, and early detection of recurrence (Matsumura and Tarin, 1992).
Mayer et al. (1993) found that expression of CD44, which is not found in
normal gastric mucosa and is found in only 49% of primary tumors, was
associated with distant metastases at time of diagnosis and with tumor
recurrence and increased mortality from gastric cancer.

Weber et al. (1996) noted that the CD44 gene encodes a transmembrane
protein that is expressed as a family of molecular isoforms generated
from alternative RNA splicing and posttranslational modifications.
Certain CD44 isoforms that regulate activation and migration of
lymphocytes and macrophages may also enhance local growth and metastatic
spread of tumor cells. One ligand of CD44 is hyaluronic acid, binding of
which to the NH2-terminal domain of CD44 enhances cellular aggregation
and tumor cell growth. (Krainer et al. (1991) referred to CD44 as a
'hyaladherin' -- see 601269.) Weber et al. (1996) demonstrated that
another ligand is osteopontin (166490). Osteopontin induces cellular
chemotaxis but not homotypic aggregation of cells, whereas the inverse
is true for the interaction between CD44 and hyaluronate. The
alternative responses to CD44 ligation may be exploited by tumor cells
to allow OPN-mediated metastatic spread and hyaluronate-dependent growth
in newly colonized tissues in the process of tumor metastasis.

Sherman et al. (1998) investigated the role of CD44 proteins in early
limb development. Members of this family of transmembrane glycoproteins
are expressed by cells of the limb bud, including those of the apical
ectodermal ridge (AER). Distinct CD44 variants are generated from a
single gene by alternative RNA splicing of up to 10 variant exons and by
extensive posttranslational modifications. The amino acid sequences
encoded by these variant exons are located in the extracellular portion
of the protein near the transmembrane domain. A standard form of CD44
lacking these variant sequences is expressed by numerous cell types and
is the smallest CD44 protein. It carries no variant exon sequences.
Splice variants are expressed in only a limited number of tissues and in
certain tumors. Signals from the AER of the developing vertebrate limb,
including fibroblast growth factor-8 (600483), can maintain limb
mesenchymal cells in proliferative state. Sherman et al. (1998) reported
that a specific CD44 splice variant is crucial for the proliferation of
these mesenchymal cells. Epitopes carried by this variant colocalize
temporally and spatially with FGF8 in the AER throughout early limb
development. A splice variant containing the same sequence expressed on
model cells binds both FGF4 (164980) and FGF8 and stimulates mesenchymal
cells in vitro. Sherman et al. (1998) found that when applied to the
AER, an antibody against a specific CD44 epitope blocked FGF
presentation and inhibited limb outgrowth. Therefore, CD44 is necessary
for limb development and functions in a novel growth factor presentation
mechanism likely relevant to other physiologic and pathologic situations
in which a cell surface protein presents a signaling molecule to a
neighboring cell.

Cywes and Wessels (2001) demonstrated that CD44-dependent group A
Streptococcus binding to polarized monolayers of human keratinocytes
induced marked cytoskeletal rearrangements manifested by membrane
ruffling and disruption of intercellular junctions. Transduction of the
signal induced by group A Streptococcus binding to CD44 on the
keratinocyte surface involved Rac1 (602048) and the cytoskeleton linker
protein ezrin (123900), as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular
proteins. Studies of bacterial translocation in 2 models of human skin
indicated that cell signaling triggered by interaction of the group A
Streptococcus capsule with CD44 opened intercellular junctions and
promoted tissue penetration by group A Streptococcus through a
paracellular route. Cywes and Wessels (2001) concluded that their
results support a model of host cytoskeleton manipulation and tissue
invasion by an extracellular bacterial pathogen.

Nedvetzki et al. (2003) identified a CD44 variant, designated CD44vRA,
in synovial fluid aspirated from 23 of 30 patients with rheumatoid
arthritis (RA; 180300). Sequence analysis showed that the CD44vRA
isoform contains an intron-derived CAG trinucleotide inclusion 5-prime
to constant exon 5 within the CD44v3-v10 isoform. Functional expression
studies in human cells showed that the CD44vRA variant interacted with
FGF2 (134920) via the heparan sulfate on exon v3 in a way that enhanced
binding and activation of soluble FGFR1 (136350) to a greater extent
than CD44v3-v10. Synovial fluid cells from RA patients bound soluble
FGFR1 more intensively than control cells. Nedvetzki et al. (2003)
postulated that activation of FGFR1 may play a role in the RA
inflammatory process.

In a mouse hindlimb model of arteriogenesis, van Royen et al. (2004)
found that Cd44 expression increased strongly during collateral vessel
growth in wildtype mice and that arteriogenesis was severely impaired in
Cd44 -/- mice. The defective arteriogenesis was accompanied by reduced
leukocyte trafficking to sites of collateral artery growth and reduced
expression of FGF2 and platelet-derived growth factor-B protein (PDGFB;
190040). In 14 consecutive patients with single-vessel coronary artery
disease, van Royen et al. (2004) found that the maximal expression of
CD44 on activated monocytes was reduced in patients with poor
collateralization compared to patients with good collateralization. Van
Royen et al. (2004) concluded that CD44 plays a pivotal role in
arteriogenesis.

By analyzing a human breast cancer cell line transduced with a micro RNA
(miRNA) expression library, Huang et al. (2008) found that human miR373
(611954) and miR520C stimulated cell migration and invasion in vitro and
in vivo. Using expression array analysis, they found that the migration
phenotype of miR373- and miR520C-expressing cells depended on
suppression of CD44. Upregulation of miR373 correlated inversely with
CD44 expression in breast cancer metastasis samples. The authors noted
that increased expression of the most common CD44 isoform correlates
with overall survival of breast cancer patients.

Godar et al. (2008) found that p53 (TP53; 191170) negatively regulated
CD44 expression in normal human mammary epithelial cells by binding to a
noncanonical p53-binding sequence in the CD44 promoter. Inhibition of
CD44 enabled the cells to respond to stress-induced, p53-dependent
cytostatic and apoptotic signals that would have otherwise been blocked
by CD44. In the absence of p53, CD44 promoted growth in a highly
tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line. In both normal and tumorigenic
cell lines, p63 (TP63; 603273) positively regulated CD44 expression.

MAPPING

Francke et al. (1983) showed that the antigens defined by monoclonal
antibodies A3D8 and A1G3 are determined by genes on 11p.

The mouse monoclonal antibody Hermes-3 recognizes the 85- to 95-kD human
lymphocyte homing receptor. Using mouse-human T-lymphocyte hybrids and
hybrids of Chinese hamster ovary cells with human amniotic fibroblasts,
Ala-Kapee et al. (1989) found that Hermes-3 expression, as demonstrated
by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, was determined
by 11pter-p13. Forsberg et al. (1989) refined the assignment of the
lymphocyte homing receptor gene to 11pter-p13 by study of Chinese
hamster-human cell hybrids in which the human parent cells had various
deletions of human chromosome 11. Although CD44 may have function as a
lymphocyte homing receptor, the gene that maps to chromosome 11 is
distinct from the lymph node homing receptor located on chromosome 1
(153240) (Seldin, 1990). In the mouse, the corresponding gene has been
referred to as Ly-24.

Cianfriglia et al. (1992) mapped a drug-sensitivity marker, MC56, to
11pter-p13. Identity of the protein to the CD44 antigen, suggested on
other grounds, was supported by the map location.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The Indian blood group (609027) comprises 2 antigens, In(a) and In(b),
which reside on CD44. By RT-PCR analysis of cDNA extracted from
In(a+b-)-transformed B lymphocytes, Telen et al. (1996) identified the
CD44 polymorphism that causes the In(b-) phenotype. The polymorphism
results in an arg46-to-pro change (R46P; 107269.0001), removing the
basically charged amino acid at the C terminus of the hyaluronan
(HA)-binding motif of CD44. In previous studies using chimeric proteins,
arg46 was shown to be crucial for HA binding by CD44 (Yang et al.,
1994). However, Telen et al. (1996) demonstrated that the R46P change
does not reduce HA binding to CD44.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schmits et al. (1997) generated mice deficient in all known isoforms of
Cd44 by targeting exons encoding the invariant N-terminal region of the
molecule. Mice were born in mendelian ratio without any obvious
developmental or neurologic deficits. Hematologic impairment was
evidenced by altered tissue distribution of myeloid progenitors with
increased levels of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage in bone
marrow and reduced numbers in spleen. Fetal liver colony-forming
unit-spleen and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilization
assays, together with reduced colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage
in peripheral blood, suggested that progenitor egress from the bone
marrow was defective. Mice also developed exaggerated granuloma
responses to Cryotosporidium parvum infection. Tumor studies showed that
SV40-transformed Cd44-deficient fibroblasts were highly tumorigenic in
nude mice, whereas reintroduction of Cd44 expression into these
fibroblasts resulted in a dramatic inhibition of tumor growth.

Teder et al. (2002) studied the role of Cd44 in lung inflammation by
using the Cd44-deficient mice generated by Schmits et al. (1997). After
intratracheal administration of bleomycin, 75% of Cd44-deficient mice
died by day 14. They developed unremitting inflammation, characterized
by impaired clearance of apoptotic neutrophils, persistent accumulation
of hyaluronan fragments at the site of the tissue injury, and impaired
activation of transforming growth factor beta-1 (190180). This phenotype
was partially reversed by reconstitution with Cd44+ cells, thus
demonstrating a critical role for this receptor in resolving lung
inflammation.

Using immunohistochemistry, Leemans et al. (2003) confirmed that
Cd44-high cells accumulated in mouse lungs following intranasal
infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cd44 -/- mice, however, had a
50% reduction in pulmonary macrophages 2 weeks after infection, although
the absolute numbers of leukocytes were unchanged. By 5 weeks after
infection, a significant reduction in Cd4 (186940)-positive lymphocyte
numbers was observed in mutant mice. At both time points, the
Cd44-deficient mice displayed disorganized granulomas containing
predominantly polymorphonuclear neutrophils rather than well-demarcated
granulomas consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages. Splenocytes were
more numerous in mice lacking Cd44, and they secreted significantly more
Ifng (147570) in response to antigen-specific stimulation than
splenocytes of wildtype mice. Flow cytometric analysis showed that human
CD44 bound to M. tuberculosis, and Cd44 -/- mouse macrophages contained
fewer bacteria than wildtype macrophages. The mutant mice allowed
greater replication of M. tuberculosis in lung and liver and had reduced
survival compared with wildtype mice. Leemans et al. (2003) proposed
that CD44 mediates resistance to mycobacterial infection by promoting
binding and phagocytosis by macrophages and by recruiting these cells to
the site of infection.

TNF (191160) is a major inducer of chronic inflammation, and its
overexpression leads to chronic inflammatory arthritis. Hayer et al.
(2005) crossed Cd44 -/- mice with mice transgenic for human TNF and
found that destruction of joints and progressive crippling was far more
severe in Cd44 -/- transgenic mice than in transgenic mice expressing
Cd44. Cd44 -/- transgenic mice exhibited increased systemic bone
resorption due to an increase in the number, size, and activity of
osteoclasts. Bone formation and osteoblast differentiation were not
affected. Cd44 -/- osteoclasts had an enhanced response to TNF that was
associated with increased activation of p38 (MAPK14; 600289). Hayer et
al. (2005) concluded that CD44 is a critical inhibitor of TNF-induced
joint destruction and inflammatory bone loss.

Krause et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Cd44 were as susceptible as
wildtype mice to murine chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; 608232) after
challenge with BCR-ABL virus. However, bone marrow cells from Cd44 -/-
mice transduced with the virus showed defective homing to recipient bone
marrow, resulting in decreased engraftment and reduced CML-like disease.
In contrast, Cd44 was dispensable for induction of B-lymphoblastic
leukemia-like disease. Krause et al. (2006) concluded that CD44 is
required for leukemic stem cells that initiate CML.

Jin et al. (2006) found that treatment with activating monoclonal
antibodies to CD44 markedly reduced leukemic repopulation in nonobese
diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice challenged
with human acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626) cells. Absence of
leukemia following serial tumor transplantation experiments in mice
demonstrated direct targeting of AML leukemic stem cells (LSCs).
Treatment of engrafted mice with anti-CD44 reduced the number of Cd34
(142230)-positive/Cd38 (107270)-negative primitive stem cells and
increased the number of Cd14 (158120)-positive monocytic cells.
Anti-CD44 treatment also diminished the homing capacity of SCID
leukemia-initiating cells to bone marrow and spleen. Jin et al. (2006)
concluded that CD44 is a key regulator of AML LSCs, which require a
niche to maintain their stem cell properties. They suggested that CD44
targeting may help eliminate quiescent AML LSCs.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INDIAN BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM POLYMORPHISM
CD44, ARG46PRO

The Indian blood group (609027) comprises 2 antigens, In(a) and In(b),
which reside on CD44. By RT-PCR analysis of cDNA extracted from
In(a+b-)-transformed B lymphocytes, Telen et al. (1996) identified the
CD44 polymorphism that causes the In(b-) phenotype. The G-to-C change at
nucleotide 252 results in an arg46-to-pro change (R46P), removing the
basically charged amino acid at the C terminus of the hyaluronan
(HA)-binding motif of CD44. In previous studies using chimeric proteins,
arg46 was shown to be crucial for HA binding by CD44 (Yang et al.,
1994). However, Telen et al. (1996) demonstrated that the R46P change
does not reduce HA binding to CD44.

607562	TITLE *607562 INTERLEUKIN 23 RECEPTOR; IL23R
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL23 is a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of p19 (IL23A; 605580) and
p40 (IL12B; 161561) subunits. The p40 subunit also interacts with p35
(IL12A; 161560) to form IL12. IL23, like IL12, binds to IL12RB1
(601604), but only IL12 binds to IL12RB2 (601642). IL23R does not
interact with IL12, but pairs with IL12RB1 to confer IL23 responsiveness
on cells expressing both subunits (Parham et al., 2002).

CLONING

By PCR analysis of cDNA libraries of T-cell lines responding to IL23,
Parham et al. (2002) identified a 2.9-kb cDNA encoding IL23R. The
predicted 629-amino acid type I transmembrane protein, which shows some
homology to IL12RB2, contains a signal sequence, an N-terminal Ig-like
domain, 2 cytokine receptor domains, 7 potential N-linked glycosylation
sites, a WQPWS motif in the transmembrane domain, and a 252-residue
cytoplasmic domain with 6 conserved tyrosine residues and an additional
tyrosine at position 463 not found in mice. Northern blot analysis
revealed expression of an approximately 2.9-kb transcript in the Kit225
T-cell line, and quantitative real-time PCR analysis detected expression
in Th1, Th0, and NK cell lines, with little expression in monocytes,
dendritic cells, or B-cell lines.

By fragment size analysis of IL23R splice variants expressed in human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), Yu and Gallagher (2010)
identified an IL23R splice variant that lacks exon 9. The variant, which
they called delta-9, represented 12 to 20% of total IL23R mRNA in PBMCs.
The deduced delta-9 protein contains 353 amino acids and has a
calculated molecular mass of 41 kD. It lacks the membrane anchor and
intracellular signaling domain of full-length IL23R, but it retains an
intact extracellular domain. Both full-length IL23R and the delta-9
variant were expressed equally inside transfected 293T cells, but unlike
full-length IL23R, delta-9 was also secreted. ELISA analysis showed that
delta-9 protein was generally present at low levels in human serum.
Western blot analysis and N-glycosidase treatment revealed that delta-9
was expressed as an N-glycosylated 65-kD protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Parham et al. (2002) determined that the
IL23R gene contains 10 exons spanning approximately 92 kb. Yu and
Gallagher (2010) stated that the IL23R gene contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Parham et al. (2002) mapped the IL23R gene
to chromosome 1p32.1-p31.2, within 150 kb of the IL12RB2 gene.

GENE FUNCTION

FACS analysis by Parham et al. (2002) readily detected binding of IL23,
but not IL12, to IL23R. Signal transduction analysis showed constitutive
association of IL23R with JAK2 (147796) and ligand-dependent association
with STAT3 (102582), as well as IL23-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation
of IL23R.

In mice, Buonocore et al. (2010) demonstrated that bacteria-driven
innate colitis is associated with an increased production of IL17
(IL17A; 603149) and interferon-gamma (147570) in the colon. Stimulation
of colonic leukocytes with IL23 induced the production of IL17 and
interferon-gamma exclusively by innate lymphoid cells expressing Thy1
(188230), stem cell antigen-1, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor
(Ror)-gamma-t; (RORC; 602943), and IL23R, and these cells markedly
accumulated in the inflamed colon. IL23-responsive innate intestinal
cells are also a feature of T cell-dependent models of colitis. The
transcription factor Ror-gamma-t, which controls IL23R expression, has a
functional role, because Rag (see 179615)-null/Rorc-null mice failed to
develop innate colitis. Last, depletion of Thy1+ innate lymphoid cells
completely abrogated acute and chronic innate colitis. Buonocore et al.
(2010) concluded their results identified a previously unrecognized
IL23-responsive innate lymphoid population that mediates intestinal
immune pathology and may therefore represent a target in inflammatory
bowel disease.

By flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analyses, Tonel et al. (2010)
demonstrated that expression of IL23 and IL23R was increased in the
tissues of patients with psoriasis (see 177900). Injection of a
neutralizing monoclonal antibody to IL23 in a xenotransplant mouse model
showed IL23-dependent inhibition of psoriasis comparable to results
obtained with anti-TNF (191160) blockers. Tonel et al. (2010) concluded
that the IL23 pathway has a critical role in the pathogenesis of
psoriasis.

Yu and Gallagher (2010) demonstrated that the IL23R delta-9 isoform
bound IL23, but not IL12, suggesting that it preferentially binds IL23
p19. Delta-9 formed a complex with IL23 and IL12RB1. In the presence of
delta-9, IL23-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was inhibited and
maturation of Th17 cells to an active phenotype was reduced, as
indicated by diminished secretion of IL17A and IL17F (606496). Yu and
Gallagher (2010) concluded that IL23R delta-9 is a soluble form of the
receptor that represents a regulatory mechanism for Th17 cells.

Wu et al. (2013) used transcriptional profiling of developing T(H)17
cells to construct a model of their signaling network and nominate major
nodes that regulate T(H)17 development. Wu et al. (2013) identified
serum glucocorticoid kinase-1 (SGK1; 602958), a serine/threonine kinase,
as an essential node downstream of IL23 signaling. SGK1 is critical for
regulating IL23R expression and stabilizing the T(H)17 cell phenotype by
deactivation of mouse Foxo1 (136533), a direct repressor of IL23R
expression. SGK1 has been shown to govern sodium transport and salt
(NaCl) homeostasis in other cells. Wu et al. (2013) showed that a modest
increase in salt concentration induces SGK1 expression, promotes IL23R
expression, and enhances T(H)17 cell differentiation in vitro and in
vivo, accelerating the development of autoimmunity. Loss of SGK1
abrogated sodium-mediated T(H)17 differentiation in an IL23-dependent
manner. Wu et al. (2013) concluded that their data demonstrated that
SGK1 has a critical role in the induction of pathogenic T(H)17 cells and
provided a molecular insight into a mechanism by which an environmental
factor such as a high-salt diet triggers T(H)17 development and promotes
tissue inflammation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Association with Inflammatory Bowel Disease 17

Duerr et al. (2006) performed a genomewide association study using
308,332 SNPs to investigate genetic factors contributing to Crohn
disease. The original study population comprised 547 non-Jewish European
ancestry patients with ileal Crohn disease and 548 non-Jewish controls.
Duerr et al. (2006) found a highly significant association between Crohn
disease and the IL23R gene (see IBD17, 612261), with an uncommon coding
variant, R381Q (607562.0001) conferring strong protection against Crohn
disease. Additional noncoding IL23R variants were independently
associated with Crohn disease. Duerr et al. (2006) then replicated the
association in an independent ileal Crohn disease cohort consisting of
401 patients and 433 controls, all of Jewish ancestry. Significant
associations were observed for several of the same markers that were
associated in the non-Jewish cohort. In a combined analysis of the data
from the 2 ileal Crohn disease case-control cohorts, 9 markers had
highly significant association P values ranging from 1.6 x 10(-9) to
3.36 x 10(-13). In family-based association testing of 27 IL23R region
markers in an independent cohort of 883 nuclear families, Duerr et al.
(2006) observed significant departure from random allele transmission to
affected offspring for R381Q and other IL23R markers in both Jewish and
non-Jewish families, providing further evidence for association between
Crohn disease and IL23R. The authors also observed distortion of allele
transmission to non-Jewish ulcerative colitis-affected offspring,
providing evidence for association of IL23R with non-Jewish ulcerative
colitis. There was no evidence for association of R381Q or other IL23R
region markers in the Jewish ulcerative colitis families. The glutamine
allele of R381Q is much less common than the arginine allele, with an
allele frequency of 1.9% in the non-Jewish patients with ileal Crohn
disease and 7% in non-Jewish controls. The glutamine allele appears to
protect against development of Crohn disease in both non-Jewish (OR,
0.26, 95% CI, 0.15-0.43) and Jewish (OR, 0.45, 95% CI, 0.27-0.73) case
control cohorts.

Libioulle et al. (2007) performed a genomewide association study with
more than 300,000 SNPs in 547 Caucasian patients with Crohn disease (CD)
from Belgium and 928 controls and found the strongest association (p
less than 10(-9)) with markers of the IL23R gene, including dbSNP
rs11209026, which corresponds to the R381Q substitution in IL23R. The
association with R381Q was replicated in 1,255 additional Caucasian CD
patients and 550 controls (combined p = 2.2 x 10 (-18)), and a
transmission disequilibrium test in 127
affected-offspring/unaffected-parent trios revealed significant
overtransmission of the associated alleles.

In an analysis of the IL23R region in CD patients from the Quebec
Founder Population and 2 independent German samples, Raelson et al.
(2007) found that the R381Q SNP did not occur consistently in all risk
and protective haplotypes, and concluded that it is highly unlikely that
R381Q fully explains the functional role of this gene in CD etiology.

In a genomewide association study involving DNA samples from 988
patients with ileal Crohn disease and 1,007 controls, Rioux et al.
(2007) found significant association with a SNP in the IL23R gene, dbSNP
rs7517847 (p = 3.06 x 10(-12)).

The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007) described a joint
genomewide association study, using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping
Array Set undertaken in the British population, which examined
approximately 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a
shared set of approximately 3,000 controls. The association between
Crohn disease and SNPs within IL23R was represented by a cluster of
associated SNPs, including dbSNP rs11805303 (p = 6.5 x 10(-13)).

Glas et al. (2007) analyzed 10 IL23R variants, previously linked to CD
by Duerr et al. (2006), in a Caucasian German IBD cohort that included
patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) as well as CD patients. All of the
IL23R variants displayed highly significant associations with CD, and 8
of the 10 variants were also significantly associated with UC (see,
e.g., 607562.0001); the strongest association was found at dbSNP
rs1004819 (p = 1.92 x 10(-11) for CD). The odds ratios differentiating
between protection and susceptibility for UC were very similar to those
observed for CD, suggesting overall similar disease-modifying effects of
the different IL23R variants on CD and UC. Glas et al. (2007) found no
evidence for epistatic interaction between IL23R and CARD15 (605956),
SLC22A4 (604190), or SLC22A5 (603377).

In a study involving 1,841 ulcerative colitis cases and 1,470 controls,
Fisher et al. (2008) genotyped 16 SNPs tagging 13 CD-associated loci
identified by genomewide association studies and confirmed the
association between IL23R variants and UC (p = 1.3 x 10(-5) at dbSNP
rs11805303). Genotyping 5 additional IL23R SNPs refined the association,
and conditional regression analysis revealed that dbSNP rs11209026
(R381Q) provided the strongest signal (OR, 0.53; p = 8.0 x 10(-8)), with
evidence that additional independent variants also contribute to
ulcerative colitis risk.

Using high-throughput sequencing of DNA pools to search for rare coding
variants influencing susceptibility to Crohn disease, Momozawa et al.
(2011) identified 3 low-frequency coding variants in the IL23R gene
conferring protection against CD: arg86-to-gln (R86Q), gly149-to-arg
(G149R), and val362-to-ile (V362I), which were all found at higher
frequencies in controls than in CD patients. They replicated a
protective effect for the known R381Q variant (607562.0001). They also
presented preliminary evidence that 2 of the variants, G149R and V362I,
also act protectively against ulcerative colitis.

Rivas et al. (2011) used pooled next-generation sequencing to study 56
genes from regions associated with Crohn disease in 350 cases and 350
controls. Through follow-up genotyping of 70 rare and low-frequency
protein-altering variants in 9 independent case-control series (16,054
Crohn disease cases, 12,153 ulcerative colitis cases, and 17,575 healthy
controls), they identified 2 additional protective variants in IL23R:
G149R (p = 3.2 x 10(-4)) and V362I (p = 1.2 x 10(-5)). These findings
confirmed the findings of Momozawa et al. (2011) and indicated that each
of these variants has a protective effect equivalent to that of the more
common R381Q substitution, although they arose on different haplotype
backgrounds and are not in linkage disequilibrium with R381Q. Despite
the large follow-up sample size (n = 31,747), Rivas et al. (2011) did
not find evidence for a protective effect of the R86Q variant.

Using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood cells from 6
individuals heterozygous for a C-to-A SNP in the 3-prime UTR of IL23R
(dbSNP rs10889677) and a SNP-specific assay, Zwiers et al. (2012) showed
that the A allele produced significantly more IL23R mRNA than the C
allele. Western blot analysis showed that AA homozygous individuals also
produced significantly more IL23R protein than CC homozygous
individuals. Database analysis suggested that the SNP abolished binding
sites for the microRNAs (miRNAs) LET7E (MIRLET7E; 611250) and LET7F (see
MIRLET7F1; 612146). Luciferase analysis confirmed the in silico
prediction and demonstrated increased IL23R expression from the C
allele, but not the A allele, when a LET7E-specific inhibitor was used.
Likewise, transfection analysis showed that both LET7E and LET7F
interfered with upregulation of IL23R in CC cells, but not AA cells.
Zwiers et al. (2012) proposed that dbSNP rs10889677, which is associated
with susceptibility to IBD, affects the functionality of the IL23R gene
by altering miRNA regulation.

- Other Associations

The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and the
Australo-Anglo-American Spondylitis Consortium (2007) found evidence
suggesting that IL23R may be a common susceptibility factor for the
major 'seronegative' diseases.

may be a susceptibility gene for leprosy.

Association with Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Using a large-scale genomewide association study, Duerr et al. (2006)
identified an uncommon coding mutation in the IL23R gene, a 1142G-A
transition, resulting in an arg381-to-glu (R381Q) substitution (dbSNP
rs11209026), that confers strong protection against Crohn disease (see
612261). This SNP was identified in 1 cohort and replicated in 2 others.
The gln381 allele was found in 7% of non-Jewish controls and 1.9% of
non-Jewish patients with ileal Crohn disease.

Libioulle et al. (2007) performed a genomewide association study with
more than 300,000 SNPs in 547 Caucasian patients with Crohn disease from
Belgium and 928 controls and found the strongest association (p less
than 10(-9)) with markers of the IL23R gene, including dbSNP rs11209026,
which corresponds to the R381Q substitution. The association with R381Q
was replicated in 1,255 additional Caucasian CD patients and 550
controls (combined p = 2.2 x 10(-18)).

Raelson et al. (2007) analyzed the IL23R region in 477 parent-proband
trios with Crohn disease from the Quebec Founder Population and 2
independent German samples involving 521 affected-child trios, 752
cases, and 828 independent controls. The authors found that the R381Q
SNP did not occur consistently in all risk and protective haplotypes,
and concluded that it is highly unlikely that R381Q fully explains the
functional role of this gene in CD etiology.

In a Caucasian German IBD cohort that included 833 CD patients, 456
patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 1,381 unrelated controls,
Glas et al. (2007) confirmed the association between dbSNP rs11209026
and protection against CD (OR, 0.43; p = 8.04 x 10(-8)) and also found a
significant association with protection from UC (OR, 0.70; p = 0.00361).

In a study involving 1,841 ulcerative colitis cases and 1,470 controls,
Fisher et al. (2008) found the strongest signal at dbSNP rs11209026 (p =
8.0 x 10(-8); OR, 0.53), with evidence that additional independent IL23R
variants also contribute to ulcerative colitis risk.

McGovern et al. (2010) combined new data from 2 genomewide association
studies of ulcerative colitis involving 266,047 SNPs and performed a
metaanalysis with previously published data (Silverberg et al., 2009),
thus bringing together a discovery set of 2,693 European UC patients and
6,791 controls; the top results from the metaanalysis were then
independently replicated with 2,009 additional European UC cases and
1,580 controls. McGovern et al. (2010) confirmed association with UC at
dbSNP rs11209026 (combined p = 1.9 x 10(-13)).

Association with Psoriasis

Capon et al. (2007) reported a significant association between the R381Q
variant and protection against psoriasis (PSORS7; 605606) among 318
British patients with the disorder. The findings were replicated in a
second group of 519 British patients. Together, the association yielded
an odds ratio of 0.49 (p = 0.00014), with the gln381 allele offering
protection from the disease. Capon et al. (2007) noted that the arg381
residue is highly conserved among higher vertebrates and is located
within the binding domain for JAK2 kinase, which is the first mediator
of the IL23R signaling cascade (Parham et al., 2002).

612399	TITLE *612399 TRANSDUCIN-LIKE ENHANCER OF SPLIT 6; TLE6
;;GROUCHO-RELATED GENE 6; GRG6
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dang et al. (2001) cloned mouse Tle6, which they called Grg6. The
deduced 581-amino acid protein shares significant similarity with the
Drosophila groucho protein, particularly in the C-terminal WD40 repeat
region. Northern blot analysis showed that Grg6 was expressed
predominantly in heart, lung, liver, muscle, and testis, with very low
expression in brain, spleen, and kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Using representational difference analysis, Dang et al. (2001) found
that the oncogenic E2A (TCF3; 147141)/HLF (142385) fusion protein
upregulated expression of Grg6 and several other groucho-related genes
following expression in a mouse pro-B cell line. A mutant E2A/HLF
protein lacking DNA-binding activity also stimulated Grg6 expression.

Li et al. (2008) identified a subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) in
mouse that assembled during oocyte growth and was essential for zygotes
to progress beyond the first embryonic cell division. Within this large
complex, Floped (OOEP; 611689), Mater (NRLP5; 609658), and Tle6
interacted with each other, and Filia independently bound Mater.
Although the transcripts encoding these proteins were degraded during
meiotic maturation and ovulation, the SCMC persisted in the early
embryo. The SCMC, which was located in the subcortex of the egg, was
excluded from regions of cell-cell contact in the cleavage-stage embryo
and segregated to the outer cells of the morulae and blastocyst. Oocytes
lacking Floped and/or Mater were fertilized, but the embryos did not
progress beyond the cleavage stage of development, and female mice
lacking Floped and/or Mater were sterile.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the TLE6 gene to chromosome 19p13.3 based on an
alignment of the TLE6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK024071) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

606753	TITLE *606753 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 4; TTC4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The 34-amino acid tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif is found in a
variety of proteins and may mediate protein-protein or protein-membrane
interactions.

CLONING

By screening multiple cDNA libraries with ESTs from chromosome 1p31, a
region in which loss of heterozygosity has been frequently observed in
breast cancers, followed by 5-prime RACE, Su et al. (1999) obtained a
cDNA encoding TTC4. The deduced 356-amino acid protein has only limited
identity with TTC1 (601963) and TTC2 (601964), but all have coiled-coil
domains, and TTC4 has 4 TPR motifs. Northern blot analysis revealed wide
expression of a 2.0-kb TTC4 transcript, although levels were low in
lung.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hey et al. (2000) determined that the TTC4 gene contains 10 exons and
spans 28 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Hey et al. (2000) mapped the TTC4 gene to chromosome 1p31.3,
excluding it as a target for loss in breast cancer. They identified a
TTC4 pseudogene, TTC4P, on 7p14-p13.

602744	TITLE *602744 GLYCERONEPHOSPHATE O-ACYLTRANSFERASE; GNPAT
;;DIHYDROXYACETONEPHOSPHATE ACYLTRANSFERASE; DHAPAT; DAPAT;;
ACYL-CoA:DIHYDROXYACETONEPHOSPHATE ACYLTRANSFERASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT, or DAPAT; EC
2.3.1.42), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids, is
localized exclusively within peroxisomes.

CLONING

Thai et al. (1997) extracted the DHAPAT enzyme from rabbit Harderian
gland peroxisomes. From peptide sequences matching EST clones, they
isolated a DHAPAT cDNA by screening a human brain cDNA library. The
DHAPAT cDNA encodes a 680-amino acid peptide containing a C-terminal
type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1).

Ofman and Wanders (1994) isolated the DHAPAT protein from human placenta
and Webber and Hajra (1993) purified it from guinea pig liver
peroxisomes. Ofman et al. (1998) determined the N-terminal amino acid
sequence of the enzyme isolated from human placenta and used this
sequence to identify a DHAPAT cDNA. They confirmed that DHAPAT contains
a PTS1 sequence (alanine-glycine-leucine) at the extreme C terminus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Thai et al. (2001) determined that the GNPAT gene contains 16 exons
spanning 30 kb.

MAPPING

Thai et al. (2001) mapped the GNPAT gene to chromosome 1q42 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Partial deficiency of DHAPAT occurs in most patients with rhizomelic
chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), along with deficiency of 4 other
peroxisomal enzymes in type 1 RCDP (215100). In addition, there are 2
forms of RCDP resulting from isolated deficiency of DHAPAT or of
alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase (alkyl-DHAP synthase),
designated as RCDP type 2 (222765) and type 3 (see 600121),
respectively, by Ofman et al. (1998). Ofman et al. (1998) identified 5
different mutations in DHAPAT in a group of 8 patients with type 2 RCDP.

Thai et al. (2001) identified homozygous and compound heterozygous
mutations in the GNPAT gene in 3 DHAPAT-deficient patients (602744.0001
and 602744.0006-602744.0007). As a consequence of the resulting
plasmalogen deficiency, structural alterations of caveolae,
clathrin-coated pits, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi cisternae were
observed, as well as a reduced rate of transferrin receptor cycling. The
authors hypothesized that plasmalogens, analogous to cholesterol, are
essential for correct membrane functioning, and their deficiency results
in impaired membrane trafficking.

Itzkovitz et al. (2012) studied 6 patients with RCDP, 3 with RCDP2 and 3
with RCDP3 (600121), and identified homozygosity or compound
heterozygosity for mutations in the GNPAT (see, e.g.,
603744.0007-603744.0009) or AGPS (see, e.g., 603051.0004) genes,
respectively. Comparison of phenotypic severity and GNPAT and AGPS
protein levels in patients with RCDP1 (215100), RCDP2, or RCDP3
indicated that milder RCDP phenotypes are likely to be associated with
residual protein function. In RCDP2 patient cell lines, GNPAT protein
was undetectable, although AGPS amounts were normal, indicating that the
absence of GNPAT does not affect levels of AGPS at steady state. In
contrast, in RCDP3 patient cell lines, GNPAT protein levels correlated
generally with the amount of AGPS protein present; Itzkovitz et al.
(2012) concluded that at steady state, the amount of wildtype GNPAT was
highly dependent on the presence of AGPS.

ANIMAL MODEL

Rodemer et al. (2003) generated a mouse model for RCDP by a targeted
disruption of the Dhapat gene. The mutant mice revealed multiple
abnormalities, such as male infertility, defects in eye development,
cataract, and optic nerve hypoplasia, some of which are also observed in
RCDP. Mass spectroscopic analysis demonstrated the presence of highly
unsaturated fatty acids including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in brain
plasmalogens and the occurrence of plasmalogens in lipid raft
microdomains (LRMs) isolated from brain myelin. In mutants, plasmalogens
were completely absent and the concentration of brain DHA was reduced.
The marker proteins flotillin-1 (FLOT1; 606998) and contactin (CNTN1;
600016) were found in brain LRMs in reduced concentrations. In addition,
the gap junctional protein connexin-43 (GJA1; 121014), known to be
recruited to LRMs and essential for lens development and
spermatogenesis, was downregulated in embryonic fibroblasts of the ether
lipid-deficient mice. In these fibroblasts, free cholesterol, an
important constituent of LRMs, was found to be accumulated in a
perinuclear compartment. Rodemer et al. (2003) concluded that
plasmalogens may be required for the correct assembly and function of
LRMs.

Teigler et al. (2009) characterized a mouse model carrying a targeted
deletion of Dhapat gene that results in the complete lack of ether
lipids (ELs). The cerebellum of these mice demonstrated defects in
foliation patterning and delay in precursor granule cell migration and
defects in myelination and concomitant reduction in the level of myelin
basic protein. Further studies showed disturbances in paranode
organization by extending Caspr (CNTNAP1; 602346) distribution and
disrupting axoglial septate-like junctions, impaired innervation of
Purkinje cells by both parallel fibers and climbing fibers, and
formation of axon swellings by the accumulation of
inositol-trisphosphate receptor-1 (ITPR1; 147265) containing smooth
ER-like tubuli. Functionally, conduction velocity of myelinated axons in
the corpus callosum was significantly reduced.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, ARG211HIS

In 2 brothers and a sister with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata and
absence of DHAPAT activity (RCDP2; 222765), who were born of
consanguineous parents, Ofman et al. (1998) demonstrated homozygosity
for a 632G-A transition in the GNPAT gene, resulting in an arg211-to-his
(R211H) substitution. One of the sibs had been described in detail by
Clayton et al. (1994); the patient had a mild form of RCDP with no
evidence of rhizomelic shortening of the limbs or cataract and with only
subtle dysmorphic features.

In 2 brothers with RCDP and DHAPAT deficiency, born of healthy
first-cousin parents, Thai et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the GNPAT gene: the R211H mutation and
a 1556A-G transition in exon 11, resulting in an asp519-to-gly (D519G;
602744.0006) substitution. Functional analysis revealed loss of enzyme
activity with the R211H mutant, and an approximately 70% reduction in
enzyme activity with D519G. The brothers presented at ages 1 year and 3
years, respectively, with developmental delay, hypotonia, failure to
thrive, microcephaly, subtle dysmorphic features, and marked punctate
epiphyseal calcifications.

.0002
RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, ARG211CYS

In a male patient with unrelated parents and a mild form of RCDP
(222765), Ofman et al. (1998) demonstrated a 631C-T transition,
resulting in an arg211-to-cys amino acid substitution affecting the same
codon as that involved in the R211H mutation (602744.0001).

.0003
RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, 2-BP INS, 848TT

In a female patient who was described by Wanders et al. (1992) and
showed all the clinical manifestations associated with RCDP (222765),
Ofman et al. (1998) demonstrated homozygosity for an insertion of 2
nucleotides, TT after nucleotide 848, resulting in a frameshift and a
premature stop. Homozygosity for the same mutation was demonstrated in a
fetus from the same parents. Prenatal diagnosis had revealed severe
DHAPAT deficiency in amniotic fluid cells. After elective termination,
the diagnosis was confirmed by activity measurements in fetal skin
fibroblasts.

.0004
RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, 1-BP DEL, NT780

In a male patient who presented with all the clinical abnormalities
characteristic for RCDP (222765) including rhizomelic shortening of the
limbs, facial dysmorphia, and mental retardation, Ofman et al. (1998)
found homozygous deletion of a single nucleotide at position 780 which
caused a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon (TGA) at position
787 and a truncated version of the DHAPAT protein.

.0005
RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, 1-BP DEL, NT1575

In a female patient with a mild form of RCDP (222765) whose parents were
unrelated, Ofman et al. (1998) found homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion at
nucleotide 1575 in the DHAPAT cDNA.

RHIZOMELIC CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA, TYPE 2
GNPAT, IVS9, T-G, -3

In a girl with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata and DHAPAT
deficiency (RCDP2; 222765) who was originally described by Elias et al.
(1998), Thai et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for a -3G-A
transition in intron 9 of the GNPAT gene, resulting in deletion of all
243 base pairs comprising exon 10 (del1281_1523).

In an 8-year-old boy with RCDP, Itzkovitz et al. (2012) identified
compound heterozygosity for the intron 9 splice site mutation
(1280-3T-G) resulting in 427_507del, and a 2-bp deletion
(1429_1430delAT; 602744.0008) in exon 10 of the GNPAT gene that was not
present as a polymorphism in dbSNP (build 133). The patient had
rhizomelia of the upper extremities, stippled epiphyses in shoulders and
knees, metaphyseal irregularities, vertebral coronal clefts, and
shortening of the posterior arch of C1. Brain MRI at 1 year of age
showed myelination delays and volume loss. His general health was good
except for a seizure disorder. At age 8 years, he could not speak, but
could scoot, walk in a walker, and peddle an adaptive tricycle. In a
cell line from the patient, GNPAT was absent but AGPS protein levels
were normal. RT-PCR and sequencing of GNPAT transcripts in cell lines
from this patient and the girl originally described by Elias et al.
(1998) revealed only 1 transcript, containing an in-frame deletion of
exon 10. Itzkovitz et al. (2012) suggested that the milder phenotype in
the girl might be due to residual protein from two 427_507del alleles
versus just 1.

GNPAT, IVS14, G-A, +5

In a 6.5-year-old boy with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata and
absent DHAPAT (RCDP2; 222765), born to first-cousin parents of Jordanian
descent, Itzkovitz et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a 1937+5G-A
transition in intron 14 of the GNPAT gene. The mutation was not present
as a polymorphism in dbSNP (build 133). RT-PCR and sequencing revealed 2
cDNA species, a larger band containing an intact intron 14 and a
smaller, less-intense band containing normal sequence. GNPAT protein was
undetectable in a cell line from the patient; however, AGPS protein
levels were normal. The patient had rhizomelia of the upper extremities
and bilateral cataracts. Radiographs showed stippled epiphyses; brain
MRI shortly after birth was normal. He spoke his first word at 1 year of
age and sat independently at 16 months; at 4.5 years of age, he was
walking with a walker. He had ongoing problems with dysphagia,
aspiration, and vesicoureteral reflux, but otherwise was in general good
health. Itzkovitz et al. (2012) suggested that the less severe clinical
and biochemical phenotype in this patient might be due to residual GNPAT
enzyme activity from reduced amounts of wildtype protein.

613121	TITLE *613121 NEXILIN, RAT, HOMOLOG OF; NEXN
;;NEXILIN-LIKE PROTEIN; NELIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NEXN is a filamentous actin (F-actin; see 102560)-binding protein that
localizes to focal contacts and may be involved in cell adhesion and
migration (Ohtsuka et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2005).

CLONING

Ohtsuka et al. (1998) cloned 2 splice variants of rat nexilin, which
they called b-nexilin and s-nexilin, from brain and cultured
fibroblasts, respectively. The name nexilin came from the Latin word
nexilis, meaning 'bound together.' Full-length b-nexilin contains an
N-terminal F-actin-binding domain (ABD), followed by a spacer, a
coiled-coil region, a second ABD, and a long C-terminal tail. In
comparison, s-nexilin lacks the N-terminal ABD and has an insertion in
the C-terminal tail. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that both
b-nexilin and s-nexilin colocalized with F-actin at focal contacts at
the ends of stress fibers. The nexilins did not localize to cell-cell
junctions. Western blot analysis detected nexilin proteins with apparent
molecular masses above 90 kD in rat brain, testis, and spleen and in
cultured rodent fibroblasts. Neither protein was detected in liver,
kidney, or epithelial cell lines. Wang et al. (2010) stated that the
full-length nexilin protein contains 675 amino acids.

By sequencing clones obtained from a heart cDNA library and by EST
database analysis, Zhao et al. (2001) cloned human nexilin, which they
called NELIN. The deduced 493-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
FERIN-like domain, followed by an ABD and a C-terminal immunoglobulin
domain. It also has 2 nuclear localization signals. Northern blot
analysis detected a major 4.0-kb transcript in adult and fetal heart and
skeletal muscle only. A minor 2.7-kb transcript, representing the NELIN
cDNA cloned by Zhao et al. (2001), was detected in adult and fetal heart
only.

Using RT-PCR, Wang et al. (2005) cloned NELIN from umbilical vein wall
mRNA. The deduced protein contains 447 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected a major transcript of about 3.0 kb in heart and
skeletal muscle. Fluorescence-tagged NELIN localized predominantly to
the cytoplasm of transfected HeLa cells, with some perinuclear
concentration. NELIN colocalized with F-actin.

Using whole-mount antisense RNA in situ hybridization, Hassel et al.
(2009) found that NEXN expression first became detectable in the
developing somite and zebrafish heart tube and remained restricted to
the heart and skeletal muscle throughout embryogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (2010) noted that the NEXN gene contains 13 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhao et al. (2001) mapped the NEXN gene to
chromosome 1p32-p31.

Hassel et al. (2009) noted that the NEXN gene maps to chromosome 1p31.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Using F-actin and deletion constructs of recombinant rat nexilins in
cosedimentation assays, Ohtsuka et al. (1998) showed that b-nexilin has
2 ABDs and that s-nexilin has a single ABD. The coiled-coil region and
the second ABD were required for localization of b-nexilin and s-nexilin
at focal contacts. Pretreatment of F-actin with myosin (see 160730)
subfragment-1, which binds along the sides of F-actin, inhibited F-actin
binding by b-nexilin. This inhibition was reversed by MgATP, which
dissociates the actin-myosin complex. B-nexilin, but not s-nexilin,
increased the viscosity of the nexilin-F-actin complex, and electron
microscopy showed that the increased viscosity was due to F-actin
crosslink formation by b-nexilin. The stoichiometry of nexilin-F-actin
binding appeared to be 1 b-nexilin molecule per about 9 actin molecules
and 1 s-nexilin molecule per about 10 actin molecules. Ohtsuka et al.
(1998) concluded that the nexilins bind along the sides of F-actin, and
that the second ABD of b-nexilin is engaged in F-actin crosslinking.

Wang et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged NELIN coimmunoprecipitated
with F-actin from rat PC12 cells. HeLa cells overexpressing NELIN showed
increased cell migration and elevated adhesion compared with control
cells.

Hassel et al. (2009) inactivated zebrafish nexilin by morpholino
injection and observed development of severe heart failure. The authors
found that nexilin was dispensable for early heart development,
differentiation of cardiomyocytes, and expression of contractile
elements, but analysis of the ultrastructure of cardiac muscle cells
revealed that although the primary organization of thick and thin
filaments was normal in nexilin-deficient zebrafish hearts, sarcomeric
units were disrupted and frequently detached from the irregular and
blurry Z discs, leaving sarcomeres in tatters. Sarcomere damage became
more extensive as the embryos aged from 48 to 72 hours after
fertilization, suggesting that nexilin has an essential role in the
maintenance of Z disc and sarcomere integrity rather than in the primary
assembly of these structures. Increasing mechanical strain aggravated Z
disc damage in nexilin-deficient skeletal muscle, implying a unique role
of nexilin in protecting Z discs from mechanical trauma.
Immunoprecipitation-western blotting assays indicated that nexilin forms
a complex with alpha-actin (see 102540), beta-actin (102630), and
alpha-actinin (see 102575) at the cardiac Z disc.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy 1CC

Because of evidence that loss of nexilin leads to severe cardiomyopathy
in zebrafish, Hassel et al. (2009) analyzed the NEXN gene in 90 patients
diagnosed with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD) and identified
heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion (G650del; 613121.0001) in 2 patients
with CMD1CC (613122). Screening of the entire NEXN coding sequence in an
additional 910 CMD patients revealed the G650del mutation in 4 more
patients. In addition, 2 heterozygous missense mutations were detected,
Y652C in 2 patients (613121.0002) and P611T in 1 patient (613121.0003).
None of the mutations were found in 1,251 age-, gender-, ethnicity- and
geography-matched controls. All mutation-positive patients were screened
for mutations in other known CMD-associated genes, but no mutations were
identified.

- Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy 20

Wang et al. (2010) analyzed the NEXN gene in 121 unrelated Han Chinese
patients with CMH who were negative for mutations in 8 common
myofilament-associated genes responsible for CMH, and they identified 2
heterozygous missense mutations in 2 probands (613121.0004 and
613121.0005, respectively) that were located at highly conserved
residues, segregated with disease in each family, and were not found in
192 ethnically matched controls.

NEXN, 3-BP DEL, 1948GGA

In 6 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1CC; 613122), Hassel et
al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the NEXN
gene, resulting loss of a conserved gly650 residue (G650del). The
deletion was not found in 1,251 age-, gender-, ethnicity- and
geography-matched controls. One proband had a mildly affected brother
who carried the deletion and an asymptomatic 33-year-old daughter, who
declined further evaluation. Two probands had fathers who did not carry
the deletion, and both obligate-carrier mothers had died of cardiac
failure; 1 of the 2 probands also had 2 brothers who had died of cardiac
failure. All G650del carriers shared an identical haplotype over a large
genomic region surrounding the NEXN gene, suggesting a founder effect.
Ultrastructural analysis of myocardial biopsy tissue from a G650del
patient showed disruption of sarcomeric units with detached and blurry Z
discs, similar to that seen in NEXN-deficient zebrafish. Ectopic
expression of G650-deleted nexilin in zebrafish resulted in dilated
cardiomyopathy, with markedly reduced systolic function and Z disc
disruption. Injection of an equal amount of wildtype nexilin had no
effect on cardiac function or ultrastructure, indicating a
dominant-negative effect of the mutant nexilin.

NEXN, TYR652CYS

In 2 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1CC; 613121), Hassel et
al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 1955A-G transition in the
NEXN gene, resulting in a tyr652-to-cys (Y652C) substitution at a highly
conserved residue. Both probands had a parent who had died of dilated
cardiomyopathy; 1 proband underwent heart transplantation at age 60
years due to progressive dilated cardiomyopathy. The 2 Y652C mutation
carriers shared a common haplotype that was distinct from the G650del
(613121.0001)-associated haplotype, suggesting a distinct founder
effect; the mutation was not found in 1,251 age-, gender-, ethnicity-
and geography-matched controls. Ultrastructural analysis of myocardial
biopsy tissue from a Y652C patient showed disruption of sarcomeric units
with detached and blurry Z discs, similar to that seen in NEXN-deficient
zebrafish. Ectopic expression of Y652C-mutated nexilin in zebrafish
resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy, with markedly reduced systolic
function and Z disc disruption. Injection of an equal amount of wildtype
nexilin had no effect on cardiac function or ultrastructure, indicating
a dominant-negative effect of the mutant nexilin.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1CC
NEXN, PRO611THR

In a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1CC; 613121), Hassel et al.
(2009) identified heterozygosity for a 1831C-A transversion in the NEXN
gene, resulting in a pro611-to-thr (P611T) substitution at a highly
conserved residue that was not found in 1,251 age-, gender-, ethnicity-
and geography-matched controls. Ectopic expression of P611T-mutated
nexilin in zebrafish resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy, with markedly
reduced systolic function and Z disc disruption; injection of an equal
amount of wildtype nexilin had no effect on cardiac function or
ultrastructure, indicating a dominant-negative effect of the mutant
nexilin.

NEXN, GLN131GLU

In a 37-year-old Han Chinese woman with familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH20; 613876), Wang et al. (2010) identified
heterozygosity for a 391C-G transversion in exon 5 of the NEXN gene,
resulting in a gln131-to-glu (Q131E) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD). The mutation was
also detected in the proband's affected brother and daughter, but was
not found in her unaffected daughter or 192 ethnically matched controls.
Transfection studies in C2C12 cells showed that mutant nexilin
accumulated in the cytoplasm and that the expressed fragment of
Q131E-mutant ABD completely lost the ability to bind F-actin (see
102610). Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated that the Q131E mutation
decreased the binding of full-length NEXN to alpha-actin (102610) and
abolished the interaction between the fragment of ABD and alpha-actin.

In a 45-year-old Han Chinese man with familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH20; 613876), Wang et al. (2010) identified
heterozygosity for an 835C-T transition in exon 8 of the NEXN gene,
resulting in an arg279-to-cys (R279C) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the coiled-coil domain. The R279C mutation was detected in
the proband's affected father and brother, and was also present in his
12-year-old clinically asymptomatic daughter, but was not found in 192
ethnically matched controls. Transfection studies in C2C12 cells showed
that mutant nexilin accumulated in the cytoplasm, but binding to
alpha-actin (102610) was not altered.

300775	TITLE *300775 E74-LIKE FACTOR 4; ELF4
;;MYELOID ELF1-LIKE FACTOR; MEF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ELF4 is a member of the ETS (see 164720) gene family of transcription
factors (Aryee et al., 1998). ELF4 is involved in inducing cell cycle
arrest in naive CD8+ T cells (Yamada et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using nested, degenerate oligonucleotide PCR to obtain an ETS
domain-containing cDNA from megakaryocytes, followed by sequence
analysis and RACE, Miyazaki et al. (1996) obtained a full-length cDNA
encoding ELF4, which they termed MEF for myeloid ELF1 (189973)-like
factor. The predicted 663-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
acidic region, an 85-amino acid ETS domain that is 94% identical to that
of ELF1, a central serine-threonine-rich region, and a proline-rich
region. Northern blot analysis revealed a major 4.2-kb transcript in
peripheral blood, ovary, spleen, thymus, liver, and colon as well as in
several cell lines of hematopoietic origin. Liver contained a minor
3.5-kb transcript, whereas a minor 6.2-kb transcript was found in the
other tissues. DNA binding and EMSA analysis indicated that MEF binds to
the ETS consensus GGA motif. Reporter assays showed that MEF, but not
ELF1, both binds and transactivates GMCSF (CSF2; 138960) and IL3
(147740) gene promoters. Miyazaki et al. (1996) concluded that MEF has
DNA binding properties similar to ELF1 but has additional
transactivating effects in hematopoietic cells.

Aryee et al. (1998) cloned and characterized ELF4, which they termed
ELFR for ELF1-related protein. Northern blot analysis revealed highest
expression in placenta.

ANIMAL MODEL

By BrdU and CFSE incorporation analysis, Yamada et al. (2009) showed
that activated naive, but not memory, Elf4 -/- CD8+ T cells proliferate
much more than Elf4+ cells. Proliferation in response to low antigen
concentrations was greater in Elf4 -/- CD8+ T cells than in those of
wildtype. The percentage of memory (CD44-high, 107269/CD122+, 146710)
CD8+ T cells increased and CD44-low cells decreased with age, and the
increase was accelerated in the absence of Elf4, accompanied by
splenomegaly, hyperplasia of the white pulp, increased CD4+ and CD8+
splenic T cells, and lymphocytic infiltration in the liver. The
Elf4-deficient mice accumulated memory cells expressing low levels of
the lymph node-homing marker CD62l (SELL; 153240) and its activator Klf2
(602016), as well as Ccr7 (600242), leading to a diversion of CD8+
memory cells from lymph nodes to the spleen. Mice lacking Elf4 also
accumulated a higher proportion and number of memory CD8+ T cells after
vaccination. Global gene expression, reporter, and ChIP analysis
determined that Klf4 (602253) is upregulated by Elf4, resulting in an
inhibition of CD8+ T cell proliferation. Yamada et al. (2009) concluded
that ELF4 regulates T cell homeostasis and the antigen-driven expansion
of polyclonal T cells by inducing KLF4 expression, and controls T cell
homing via KLF2. In turn, through KLF4 expression, ELF4 maintains the
expression of CD62L and CCR7 on memory T cells.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Aryee et al. (1998) mapped the ELFR gene to chromosome Xq26.

;;MYOMEGALIN, RAT, HOMOLOG OF;;
MYOMEGALIN-LIKE PROTEIN; MMGL;;
KIAA0454;;
KIAA0477
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
rat Pde4d (600129), Verde et al. (2001) cloned rat Pde4dip, which they
called myomegalin. Rat myomegalin is a 2,324-amino acid protein composed
mostly of alpha-helical and coiled-coil structures. It contains domains
that share similarity with microtubule-associated proteins, as well as a
leucine zipper identical to that found in Drosophila centrosomin (see
602039). Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5- to 8.0-kb transcript in
most rat tissues examined; testis-, heart-, and skeletal muscle-specific
variants were also detected. Western blot analysis detected myomegalin
at about 62 kD in testis and at 230 to 250 kD in heart and skeletal
muscle. Immunocytochemistry and transfection studies demonstrated
colocalization of myomegalin with Pde4d in the Golgi/centrosomal area of
cultured cells and in sarcomeric structures of skeletal muscle.

By analyzing ESTs for cardiac muscle-specific transcripts, followed by
screening heart cDNA libraries and 5-prime RACE, Soejima et al. (2001)
cloned 4 splice variants of PDE4DIP, which they called MMGL. The
variant-1 transcript has a long 3-prime untranslated region containing 9
possible polyadenylation signals, and it encodes a deduced 174-amino
acid protein. Variants 2, 3, and 4 encode proteins of 174, 173, and 240
amino acids, respectively. Northern blot analysis detected high
expression of a 1.0- to 1.3-kb band and lower expression of 4.4- and
8.5-kb bands in adult and fetal heart, skeletal muscle, and all specific
heart regions examined. Only the 4.4-kb transcript was detected in
aorta. Fluorescence-tagged variants 1 and 4 were expressed in both the
cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected mouse myocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation studies of
myomegalin expressed in COS-7 cells, Verde et al. (2001) found that rat
myomegalin associated with variant 3 of Pde4d and that they were
sequestered in particulate structures.

GENE STRUCTURE

Soejima et al. (2001) determined that the PDE4DIP gene contains 8 exons
and spans at least 70 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Soejima et al. (2001) mapped the PDE4DIP
gene to chromosome 1q1, but by FISH they mapped it to chromosomes 1q1
and 1p1. They determined that chromosome 1q1 is the correct location of
the PDE4DIP gene.

Wilkinson et al. (2003) reported the molecular cloning of a novel
translocation t(1;5)(q23;q33). They showed that it resulted in fusion of
the PDGFRB gene (173410) on 5q33 with the PDE4DIP gene, which by this
evidence is located on 1q23. They found that the translocation
t(1;5)(q23;q33) resulted in a myeloproliferative disorder associated
with eosinophilia.

604126	TITLE *604126 SUPERVILLIN; SVIL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Supervillin is a 205-kD F-actin-binding protein originally isolated from
bovine neutrophils. This protein is tightly associated with both actin
filaments and plasma membranes, suggesting that it forms a link between
the actin cytoskeleton and the membrane.

CLONING

Pope et al. (1998) used PCR with primers based on bovine sequence to
clone human supervillin. The human gene encodes a 1,788-amino acid
polypeptide that contains 3 predicted nuclear localization signals,
several consensus phosphorylation sites, 1 ATP/GTP-binding motif, 1
potential RNP-binding site, and 3 potential actin-binding sites. The
region containing the actin-binding sites is similar to the 'headpiece'
of villin (193040). Dot blots showed that many tissues express
supervillin, with the highest expression in muscle tissues. Northern
blot analysis revealed a 7.5-kb mRNA that is abundant in some human
cancer cell lines. Southern blot analysis revealed that supervillin is a
single-copy gene.

Activation of androgen receptor (AR; 313700) via androgen in muscle
cells is closely linked to their growth and differentiation. Ting et al.
(2002) cloned and characterized supervillin as an AR coregulator from a
skeletal muscle cDNA library. They identified a domain within
supervillin (amino acids 594 to 1,268) that could interact with the AR N
terminus and DNA-binding domain-ligand-binding domain in a
ligand-enhanced manner. Subcellular colocalization studies with
fluorescence staining indicated that supervillin colocalized with AR in
the presence of 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone in COS-1 cells. Furthermore,
supervillin could enhance expression of the endogenous AR target gene
p27(KIP1) (600778) in prostate cells. Thus, supervillin is an AR
coregulator that can enhance AR transactivation in muscle and other
cells.

MAPPING

Pope et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
supervillin gene to chromosome 10p11.2

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The specific inhibitors of plasminogen activators (173370, 191840) have
been classified into 4 immunologically distinct groups: PAI1 type PA
inhibitor from endothelial cells (173360); PAI2 type PA inhibitor from
placenta, monocytes, and macrophages; urinary inhibitor; and
protease-nexin-I. Antalis et al. (1988) purified human monocyte-derived
plasminogen activator inhibitor to homogeneity and partially sequenced
it. They used oligonucleotide probes derived from this sequence to
screen a cDNA library. By nucleotide sequence analysis, they showed that
the PAI2 cDNA encodes a protein containing 450 amino acids with a
predicted unglycosylated molecular mass of 46,543. Plasminogen activator
inhibitor-2 is also known as monocyte arg-serpin because it belongs to
the superfamily of serine proteases in which the target specificity of
each is determined by the amino acid residue located at its reactive
center; i.e., met or val for elastase, leu for kinase, and arg for
thrombin.

Webb et al. (1987) isolated the cDNA encoding a monocyte-derived PAI.

GENE FUNCTION

Kruithof et al. (1995) concluded that although a large body of
information has accumulated on the biology, biochemistry, and clinical
aspects of PAI2, suggesting that it is involved in many physiologic and
pathologic processes, its precise role in placenta, in pregnancy plasma,
in skin, and in inflammatory conditions, as well as the diagnostic and
therapeutic possibilities of PAI2, remained to be established.

Using gene expression microarrays, Woodruff et al. (2007) found that
CLCA1 (603906), periostin (POSTN; 608777), and SERPINB2 were upregulated
in airway epithelial cells of individuals with asthma (see 600807), but
not smokers. Corticosteroid treatment downregulated expression of these
3 genes and upregulated expression of FKBP51 (602623). High baseline
expression of CLCA1, POSTN, and SERPINB2 was associated with a good
clinical response to corticosteroids, whereas high expression of FKBP51
was associated with a poor response. Treatment of airway epithelial
cells with IL13 resulted in increased expression of CLCA1, POSTN, and
SERPINB2, an effect that could be suppressed by corticosteroids.

Gastrin (GAS; 137250) regulates the expression of a variety of genes
involved in the control of acid secretion. It also triggers tissue
response to damage, infection, and inflammation in cells expressing
gastrin receptor (CCKBR; 118445) and, indirectly, in nearby cells via a
paracrine mechanism. Almeida-Vega et al. (2009) found that gastrin
directly induced upregulation of PAI2 in CCKBR-positive cells.
CCKBR-positive cells also released IL8 (146930) and prostaglandin E2
into the culture medium in response to gastrin, which resulted in
elevated PAI2 expression in cocultured CCKBR-negative cells. IL8
signaling in CCKBR-negative cells upregulated PAI2 via binding of the
ASC1 complex (see TRIP4; 604501) to the PAI2 promoter. Prostaglandin E2
independently upregulated PAI2 via RHOA (165390)-dependent signaling
that induced binding of MAZ (600999) to the PAI2 promoter.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis revealed that MAZ and the p50 subunit of the ASC1 complex
(ASCC1; 614215) bound directly to sites in the PAI2 promoter. Mutation
of the putative MAZ site in the PAI2 promoter reduced responses to RHOA.
Knockdown of the p50 or p65 (TRIP4) subunits of the ASC1 complex via
small interfering RNA significantly reduced PAI2 upregulation in
response to gastrin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Samia et al. (1990) demonstrated that the intron-exon arrangement of
PAI2 is identical to that of chicken ovalbumin and Y genes and distinct
from that of other members of the serpin superfamily.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of human-mouse somatic cell hybrid DNA, Webb
et al. (1987) located the PAI2 gene, which they called PLANH2, to human
chromosome 18. Oldenburg et al. (1989) also assigned PAI2 to chromosome
18 by Southern analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrid DNAs. By in
situ hybridization, Webb et al. (1989) assigned the PLANH2 gene to
18q21.2-q22. By YAC cloning of a 2-Mb contig within chromosomal band
18q21, Silverman et al. (1991) established physical linkage of BCL2
(151430) with PLANH2. They concluded that PLANH2 is 600 kb telomeric to
BCL2 and has an opposite transcriptional orientation.

Bartuski et al. (1997) identified 6 genes in a 500-kb region of 18q21.3.
The order of the 6 genes from centromere to telomere was determined to
be cen--PI5 (154790)--SCCA2 (600518)--SCCA1 (600517)--PAI2--PI10
(602058)--PI8 (601697)--tel.

ANIMAL MODEL

PAI2 is thought to serve as a primary regulator of plasminogen
activation in the extravascular compartment. High levels of PAI2 are
found in keratinocytes, monocytes, and the human trophoblast, the latter
suggesting a role in placental maintenance or in embryo development. The
primarily intracellular distribution of PAI2 may also indicate a unique
regulatory role in a protease-dependent cellular process such as
apoptosis (Dickinson et al., 1995). To examine the potential functions
of PAI2 in vivo, Dougherty et al. (1999) generated PAI2-deficient mice
by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. Homozygous PAI2-deficient
mice exhibited normal development, survival, and fertility, and were
also indistinguishable from normal controls in response to a bacterial
infectious challenge or endotoxin infusion. No differences in monocyte
recruitment into the peritoneum were observed after thioglycollate
injection. Epidermal wound healing was equivalent among null and control
mice. Finally, crossing PAI2 -/- with PAI1 -/- mice to generate animals
deficient in both plasminogen activator inhibitors failed to uncover an
overlap in function between these 2 related proteins.

600411	TITLE *600411 GUANYLATE-BINDING PROTEIN 1, INTERFERON-INDUCIBLE, 67-KD; GBP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Interferons are cytokines that have antiviral effects and inhibit tumor
cell proliferation. They induce a large number of genes in their target
cells, including those coding for guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs).
GBPs, such as GBP1, are characterized by their ability to specifically
bind guanine nucleotides (GMP, GDP, and GTP) and are distinguished from
the GTP-binding proteins by the presence of 2 binding motifs rather than
3 (Cheng et al., 1991).

CLONING

Cheng et al. (1991) cloned cDNAs for GBP1 (a 67-kD protein) and GBP2
(600412).

Olszewski et al. (2006) reported that the 593-amino acid GBP1 protein
shares 77% and 88% identity with GBP2 and GBP3 (600431), respectively.
All GBPs, including GBP1, have a conserved N-terminal globular
GTP-binding domain containing 2 consensus sequences and a third T(L/V)RD
sequence not found in other GTPases. GBP1, GBP2, and GBP5 (611467)
contain a C-terminal CaaX isoprenylation motif. EST database analysis
showed wide expression of GBP1 in human tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

The putative window of embryo implantation in the human opens between
days 19 to 24 of the menstrual cycle. A major challenge in the study of
human reproduction is to identify the molecular signals that participate
in the establishment of this critical receptive phase in the context of
the natural cycle. Toward this goal, Kumar et al. (2001) analyzed human
endometrial biopsies at various days of the menstrual cycle by mRNA
differential display. They isolated several cDNAs representing genes
that are either up- or downregulated within the putative window of
implantation. They identified one of these genes as GBP1, which
possesses GTPase activity. Analysis of endometrial biopsies by Northern
blot and RT-PCR demonstrated that GBP1 mRNA is specifically induced at
the midsecretory phase of the menstrual cycle. In situ hybridization
analysis revealed that GBP1 mRNA expression is localized in the
glandular epithelial cells as well as in the stroma in the immediate
vicinity of the glands. The authors concluded that its unique expression
overlapping the putative window of implantation suggests that GBP1 may
serve as a useful marker of uterine receptivity in the human.

Using RT-PCR, Tripal et al. (2007) detected high expression of GBP1,
GBP2, and GBP3 in endothelial cells after stimulation with IFNG
(147570), TNF (191160), or IL1B (147720). Immunofluorescence analysis
demonstrated cytoplasmic expression of GBP1. In the presence of aluminum
fluoride, IFNG induced translocation of GBP1 to the Golgi apparatus.

Kim et al. (2011) examined a complete mouse 65-kD guanylate-binding
protein (Gbp) gene family as part of a 43-member
interferon-gamma-inducible guanosine triphosphatase superfamily in mouse
and human genomes. Family-wide loss of function analysis found that at
least 4 Gbps--Gbp1 (see 600412), Gbp6, Gbp7 (612468), and
Gbp10--conferred cell-autonomous immunity to listerial or mycobacterial
infection within macrophages and gene-deficient animals. These Gbps
solicited host defense proteins, including the phagocyte oxidase,
antimicrobial peptides, and autophagy effectors, to kill intracellular
bacteria. Thus, Kim et al. (2011) concluded that specific 65-kD Gbps
coordinate a potent oxidative and vesicular trafficking program to
protect the host from infection.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Ghosh et al. (2006) found that the isolated N-terminal G domain of GBP1
retained the main enzymatic properties of the full-length protein and
cleaved GDP. Crystal structures of the N-terminal G domain and
biochemical data revealed that, like other GTP-binding proteins,
homodimerization of GBP1 is regulated by structural changes in the
switch region. Homodimerization generates a conformation in which arg48
of the P loop and ser73 are oriented for efficient catalysis.
Positioning of the substrate for the second hydrolysis step is achieved
by a change in nucleotide conformation at the ribose that keeps the
guanine base interactions intact and positions the beta-phosphates in
the gamma-phosphate-binding site.

GENE STRUCTURE

Strehlow et al. (1994) identified the human GBP1 gene and showed that it
contains 11 exons. Olszewski et al. (2006) determined that, like other
GBPs, the GBP1 gene contains 11 exons and begins translation in exon 2.

MAPPING

By use of somatic cell hybrid DNAS, Strehlow et al. (1994) mapped the
GBP1 gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis, Olszewski et
al. (2006) mapped the GBP1 gene to the GBP gene cluster on chromosome
1p22.2. It is located telomeric to GBP2 and centromeric to GBP3.

A mouse homolog of GBP1 has been mapped to the distal region of mouse
chromosome 3 (Prochazka et al., 1985).

606233	TITLE *606233 PROKINETICIN 1; PROK1
;;PK1; PRK1;;
ENDOCRINE GLAND-DERIVED VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR; EG-VEGF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF)
induces proliferation, migration, and fenestration in capillary
endothelial cells derived from endocrine glands. Its expression is
induced by hypoxia and is restricted to the steroidogenic glands (ovary,
testis, adrenal, and placenta). Its expression is often complementary to
the expression of VEGF (192240), suggesting that these molecules
function in a coordinated manner.

CLONING

LeCouter et al. (2001) screened a library of purified human secreted
proteins for the ability to induce proliferation in primary bovine
adrenal cortex-derived capillary endothelial cells. EG-VEGF was capable
of inducing a strong and reproducible mitogenic response. Mature EG-VEGF
is a protein with a relative molecular mass of 8,600 encoded by a cDNA
cloned from human ovary library. The 1.4-kb cDNA encodes a protein of
105 amino acids with a well defined signal sequence. The mature protein
is predicted to have 86 amino acids, including 10 cysteines, and an
expected isoelectric point of 8.46. These cysteines potentially form 5
disulfide bridges. EG-VEGF displays a high degree of homology to a
nontoxic protein purified from the venom of the black mamba snake, venom
protein A (VPRA). The structure of native VPRA was solved, and the
disulfide bridge partners were revealed. The number and spacing of
cysteines are completely conserved between VPRA and EG-VEGF. BV8, a
human molecule closely related to a peptide isolated from the
yellow-bellied toad, is 58% identical to the EG-VEGF mature protein.
There is also significant homology to the carboxy-terminal sequence of
Xenopus dickkopf (see 605189) and to colipase (120105).

Li et al. (2001) identified EG-VEGF as prokineticin-1.

GENE FUNCTION

EG-VEGF is mitogenic and chemoattractive and able to induce
fenestration. EG-VEGF expression is induced by hypoxia, and there is an
HIF1 (603348) binding site present on EG-VEGF. EG-VEGF is able to induce
angiogenesis and ovarian cyst formation. Northern blot analysis
demonstrated expression in testis, ovary, adrenal gland, and placenta. A
signal was detectable in prostate after prolonged exposure.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PROK1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP SHGC-16135).

607301	TITLE *607301 PRECURSOR mRNA-PROCESSING FACTOR 3, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; PRPF3
;;PRP3;;
HPRP3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The removal of introns from nuclear pre-mRNAs occurs on complexes called
spliceosomes, which are made up of 4 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
(snRNP) particles and an undefined number of transiently associated
splicing factors. PRPF3 is 1 of several proteins that associate with U4
and U6 snRNPs.

CLONING

Using peptide sequences of PRP3 purified from HeLa cell nuclear
extracts, Lauber et al. (1997) and Horowitz et al. (1997) identified
ESTs containing PRP3 and sequenced full-length cDNAs. The deduced
683-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 77.5 kD.
PRP3 shares significant homology with yeast and nematode Prp3, with the
similarity limited to their C-terminal halves. Lauber et al. (1997)
determined that PRP3 contains an N-terminal nuclear localization signal
and serine-rich region, followed by a proline-rich region and a
C-terminal nuclear localization signal. Overall, PRP3 has a large
percentage of basic residues (18% arginine and lysine). PRP3 also
contains 3 sequences that are homologous to one another and that share a
central ELK motif. It also has a region with some similarity to a
double-stranded RNA-binding motif. In vitro translation resulted in a
protein that comigrated with the native protein at an apparent molecular
mass of about 90 kD.

Using yeast Prp3 to interrogate a sequence database, followed by PCR and
cDNA library screening, Wang et al. (1997) cloned HPRP3. The deduced
protein contains 682 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of
about 77 kD. Western blot analysis of HeLa cell nuclear extracts
detected PRP3 protein at an apparent molecular mass of about 90 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

Lauber et al. (1997) and Wang et al. (1997) confirmed the presence of
HPRP3 in U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNPs and showed that HPRP3 associated more
tightly with U4/U6 snRNP. Wang et al. (1997) determined that recombinant
HPRP3, produced in E. coli, interacted directly with HPRP4 (607795) from
HeLa cell nuclear extracts.

Gonzalez-Santos et al. (2002) determined that the central region of
HPRP3, but not the N or C termini, is required for HPRP4 binding. They
hypothesized that HPRP3 may recruit HPRP4 for the U4/U6 snRNP assembly.

MAPPING

By FISH, Heng et al. (1998) mapped the PRPF3 gene to chromosome 1q21.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutations in human splicing factors PRPF31 (606419) and PRPF8 (607300)
may cause retinitis pigmentosas (RP) in some families. Since the human
HPRP3 gene, ortholog of the yeast pre-mRNA splicing factor PRP3,
localizes within the RP18 disease interval, Chakarova et al. (2002)
screened HPRP3 as a candidate in 3 chromosome 1q-linked RP families. Two
different missense mutations in 2 English families, a Danish family, and
in 3 RP individuals were identified. Both mutations are clustered within
a 2-codon stretch in the eleventh exon of the HPRP3 gene. One of the
mutations, thr494 to met (T494M; 607301.0001), was seen repeatedly in
apparently unlinked families, raising the possibility of a mutation
hotspot. Haplotype analysis using SNPs spanning the HPRP3 gene region
supported multiple origins of the mutation. The altered amino acids,
which were highly conserved in all known HPRP3 orthologs, suggested a
major function of that domain in the splicing process. Although HPRP3
appears to be ubiquitously expressed, the authors speculated that a
retina-specific splicing element may interact with HPRP3 and generate
the rod photoreceptor-specific phenotype.

By quantitating RNA content in Northern blots, Tanackovic et al. (2011)
determined that normal human retina expressed about 7 times more major
snRNAs than other tissues tested. Retina also expressed about twice as
many minor snRNAs than other tissues, except for testis, which had
comparable minor snRNA content. Retina also showed higher content of
processed pre-mRNAs. Compared with normal human lymphocytes, patient
lymphocyte cell lines with mutations in the PRPF31, PRPF3, and PRPF8
genes showed mutation- and gene-specific changes in the stoichiometry of
snRNAs and altered composition of the precatalytic U4/U6.U5 complex.
Mutations in the PRPF genes caused delayed spliceosome assembly, with
transcript-specific splicing defects and altered patterns of alternative
splicing. Tanackovic et al. (2011) concluded that retinitis pigmentosa
is a systemic splicing disease, but that retina is more sensitive to the
defect due to elevated splicing activity in retina compared with other
tissues.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 18
PRPF3, THR494MET

In 2 English families and a Danish family with retinitis pigmentosa-18
(601414), Chakarova et al. (2002) found a 1482C-T transition in exon 11
of the PRPF3 gene, resulting in a thr494-to-met (T494M) substitution at
a highly conserved residue. Three of 150 simplex RP patients screened
were also heterozygous for the mutation.

Gonzalez-Santos et al. (2008) showed that the T494M substitution
significantly reduced the phosphorylation of PRPF3 by casein kinase II
(see 115440) in vitro and in cultured cells. Consequently, the PRPF3
C-terminal region was defective in its association with itself, PRPF4
(607795), and U4/U6 snRNA. Gonzalez-Santos et al. (2008) concluded that
phosphorylation of PRPF3 on T494 is a key step in initiating
interactions within U4/U6 snRNP complex, and that aberrant interactions
between T494M and the U4/U6 snRNP complex cause the RP18 phenotype.

.0002
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 18
PRPF3, PRO493SER

In an isolated case of retinitis pigmentosa-18 (601414), Chakarova et
al. (2002) found a 1478C-T transition in exon 11 of the PRPF3 gene,
resulting in a pro493-to-ser (P493S) substitution at a highly conserved
residue.

.0003
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA 18
PRPF3, ALA489ASP

In affected members of a Spanish family with retinitis pigmentosa-18
(601414), Gamundi et al. (2008) identified a heterozygous 1466C-A
transversion in exon 11 of the PRPF3 gene, resulting in an ala489-to-asp
(A489D) substitution.

311850	TITLE *311850 PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE I; PRPS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS; EC 2.7.6.1) catalyzes the
phosphoribosylation of ribose 5-phosphate to
5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, which is necessary for the de novo and
salvage pathways of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis (Roessler et al.,
1990). Three PRPS genes have been identified: the widely expressed PRPS1
and PRPS2 (311860) genes, which map to chromosome Xq22-q24 and Xp22,
respectively, and PRPS3 (PRPS1L1; 611566), which maps to chromosome 7
and appears to be transcribed only in testis (Becker, 2001).

CLONING

Roessler et al. (1990) isolated a partial clone corresponding to the
PRPS1 gene from a human lymphoblast cDNA library. The deduced PRPS1
protein has 318 amino acids and shares 95% amino acid homology with
PRPS2. Becker et al. (1990) also cloned the PRPS1 gene and detected a
2.3-kb mRNA transcript.

By Northern blot analysis using rat Prps1 as probe, Taira et al. (1989)
detected a 2.3-kb transcript in human adipose tissue, testis, and
placenta and in 2 human cell lines.

Kim et al. (2007) demonstrated that the PRPS1 amino acid sequence shows
an exceptionally high degree of conservation, with homologies greater
than 95% across different species from zebrafish to human.

GENE STRUCTURE

The PRPS1 gene spans over 30 kb and contains 7 exons (Becker, 2001).

MAPPING

By the Goss-Harris method, Becker et al. (1978) concluded that the order
of loci on chromosome Xq is G6PD (305900)--HPRT1
(308000)--PRPS1--alpha-GAL (GLA; 300644)--PGK1 (311800)--centromere.
Becker et al. (1979) assigned the PRPS1 locus to a position between the
GLA and HPRT1 loci, particularly close to the latter, and discussed the
functional significance of the proximity of the genes for their
biochemically related functions.

Becker et al. (1990) mapped PRPS1 to Xq22-q24 by a combination of in
situ hybridization and study of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids.

- Pseudogene

By in situ chromosomal hybridization, Becker et al. (1990) identified a
PRPS1-related gene or pseudogene (PRPS1L2) on chromosome 9q33-q34.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

De Brouwer et al. (2010) provided a review of the clinical and molecular
features of the 4 distinct syndromes caused by mutation in the PRPS1
gene: PRPS1 superactivity (300661), X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease-5 (CMTX5; 311070), Arts syndrome (301835), and isolated X-linked
sensorineural deafness (304500). The neurologic phenotype in all 4
PRPS1-related disorders seems to result primarily from reduced levels of
GTP and possibly other purine nucleotides including ATP, suggesting that
these disorders belong to the same disease spectrum. Preliminary results
of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) supplementation in 2 Australian brothers
with Arts syndrome revealed some improvement of their condition,
suggesting that SAM supplementation could potentially alleviate some of
the symptoms of patients with PRPS1 spectrum diseases by replenishing
purine nucleotides.

- Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate Synthetase Superactivity

In patients with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity
(300661), Roessler et al. (1991, 1993) and Becker et al. (1995)
identified mutations in the PRPS1 gene (311850.0001-311850.0008). All
patients except 1 had hyperuricemia, neurodevelopmental abnormalities,
and sensorineural deafness; the other patient had only hyperuricemia and
gout. Functional expression studies of all mutations showed that enzyme
overactivity was due to alteration of allosteric feedback mechanisms.

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, X-linked Recessive, 5

In affected males with X-linked recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-5
(CMTX5; 311070), Kim et al. (2007) identified mutations in the PRPS1
gene (311850.0009; 311850.0010). The phenotype includes peripheral
neuropathy, sensorineural deafness, and visual impairment. Kim et al.
(2007) used a positional cloning technique and evaluation of candidate
genes known to be expressed in the cochlea to identify the PRPS1 gene
for study. The mutations were shown to result in decreased enzyme
activity; none of the affected individuals had increased uric acid or
gout. Kim et al. (2007) noted that both PRPS1 superactivity and CMT5X
phenotypes share neurologic features.

- Arts Syndrome

Arts syndrome (301835) is an X-linked disorder characterized by mental
retardation, early-onset hypotonia, ataxia, delayed motor development,
hearing impairment, and optic atrophy. Using oligonucleotide microarray
expression profiling of fibroblasts from 2 probands in a Dutch family
with Arts syndrome, de Brouwer et al. (2007) found reduced expression
levels of PRPS1. Sequencing of PRPS1 led to the identification of 2
different missense mutations: L152P (311850.0011) in the Dutch family
and Q133P (311850.0012) in the Australian family. Both mutations
resulted in a loss of PRPS1 activity, as was shown in silico by
molecular modeling and was shown in vitro by enzyme assays in
erythrocytes and fibroblasts from patients. This was in contrast to the
gain-of-function mutations in PRPS1 identified in PRPS-related gout. The
loss-of-function mutations of PRPS1 probably result in impaired purine
biosynthesis, which was supported by the undetectable hypoxanthine in
urine and the reduced uric acid levels in serum from patients. De
Brouwer et al. (2007) suggested that treatment with S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM) theoretically could have therapeutic efficacy to replenish low
levels of purine, and a clinical trial involving the 2 affected
Australian brothers was underway. De Brouwer et al. (2010) reported
preliminary results of the 2 Australian brothers with Arts syndrome.

- X-linked Deafness 1

In a large 5-generation Chinese family segregating X-linked nonsyndromic
hearing loss (NSHL) mapping to the DNF2 locus (DFNX1; 304500) on
chromosome Xq22, Liu et al. (2010) analyzed 14 candidate genes and
identified a missense mutation in the PRPS1 gene (D65N; 311850.0013)
that cosegregated with the phenotype. Analysis of the PRPS1 gene in a
British American DNF2 family, previously reported by Tyson et al.
(1996), revealed a different missense mutation (A87T; 311850.0014);
missense mutations were also detected in DFN2 families previously
reported by Manolis et al. (1999) and Cui et al. (2004) (311850.0015 and
311850.0016, respectively). Liu et al. (2010) stated that none of the
mutations were predicted to result in a major structural change in the
PRPS1 protein, which might explain why the disease phenotype was limited
to NSHL.

HISTORY

Wada et al. (1974) and Iinuma et al. (1975) reported a Japanese infant
with mental retardation, hypouricemia, megaloblastic changes in the bone
marrow, and orotic aciduria associated with erythrocyte PRPS deficiency.
Hypsarrhythmia was first observed at 10 months of age and markedly
improved with ACTH therapy concomitant with an increase in red cell PRPS
activity. However, studies in fibroblasts from this patient did not
confirm enzyme deficiency (Becker, 2001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, ASN113SER

In a boy with hyperuricemia, sensorineural deafness, ataxia, and
secondary renal insufficiency associated with PRPS1 superactivity
(300661) reported by Becker et al. (1986), Roessler et al. (1991, 1993)
identified a 341A-G transition in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an
asn113-to-ser (N113S) substitution. Biochemical studies in fibroblasts
were consistent with PRPS superactivity and purine nucleotide
feedback-resistance. The nucleotide sequence of PRPS2 cDNA was normal.

By in vitro functional expression studies in E. coli, Becker et al.
(1995) demonstrated that the N113S mutation resulted in alteration of
the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme inhibition by purine
nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

.0002
PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, ASP182HIS

In a boy with hyperuricemia, mental retardation, and sensorineural
deafness associated with PRPS1 superactivity (300661) reported by Becker
et al. (1980), Roessler et al. (1991, 1993) identified a 547C-G
transversion in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an asp182-to-his (D182H)
substitution. His affected mother had gout, uric acid urolithiasis, and
significant hearing loss. The nucleotide sequence of PRPS2 cDNA was
normal. Fibroblast studies of this patient and his mother (Becker et
al., 1980) indicated that the mutant enzyme had both regulatory and
catalytic defects. The enzyme showed 4- to 5-fold greater than normal
resistance to feedback inhibition and, in addition, increased maximal
velocity of the enzyme reaction. The son was hemizygous, and his mother
heterozygous, for the defect.

By in vitro functional expression studies in E. coli, Becker et al.
(1995) demonstrated that the D182H mutation resulted in alteration of
the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme inhibition by purine
nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, ASP51HIS

In a man with gout due to PRPS1 superactivity (300661) resulting from
purine nucleotide feedback-resistance (Zoref et al., 1975), Becker et
al. (1995) identified a 154G-C transversion in the PRPS1 gene, resulting
in an asp51-to-his (D51H) substitution. The patient had recurrent uric
acid lithiasis since age 14 years and severe gouty arthritis since age
20 years. His mother had increased uric acid excretion. In vitro
functional expression studies in E. coli demonstrated that the D51H
mutation resulted in alteration of the allosteric mechanisms regulating
both enzyme inhibition by purine nucleotides and activation by inorganic
phosphate.

(1995) identified a 385C-A transversion in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in
a leu128-to-ile (L128I) substitution. In vitro functional expression

(1995) identified a 569C-T transition in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an
ala189-to-val (A189V) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies in E. coli demonstrated that the A189V mutation resulted in
alteration of the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme
inhibition by purine nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

PRPS1, HIS192GLN

In a boy with hyperuricemia, mental retardation, and sensorineural

(1995) identified a 579C-G transversion in the PRPS1 gene, resulting in
a his192-to-gln (H192Q) substitution. In vitro functional expression
studies in E. coli demonstrated that the H192Q mutation resulted in
alteration of the allosteric mechanisms regulating both enzyme
inhibition by purine nucleotides and activation by inorganic phosphate.

CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED RECESSIVE, 5
PRPS1, GLU43ASP

In 2 affected brothers with X-linked recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease-5 (311070), Kim et al. (2007) identified a 129A-C transversion
in exon 2 of the PRPS1 gene, resulting in a glu43-to-asp (E43D)
substitution on the 'flag' region of the N-terminal domain. The affected
residue is highly conserved from zebrafish to human, and the mutation
was not observed in 50 unrelated Caucasian individuals or in 1,103
Korean control chromosomes. None of the affected individuals had
increased uric acid production or gout.

.0010
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, X-LINKED RECESSIVE, 5
PRPS1, MET115THR

In affected members of a Korean family with CMTX5 (311070), Kim et al.
(2007) identified a 344T-C transition in exon 3 of the PRPS1 gene,
resulting in a met115-to-thr (M115T) substitution in the alpha-helix of
the N-terminal domain. The affected residue is highly conserved from
zebrafish to human, and the mutation was not observed in 1,103 Korean
control chromosomes. In vitro functional expression studies showed that
the M115T mutation resulted in partial loss of enzyme function. None of
the affected individuals had increased uric acid production or gout.

ARTS SYNDROME
PRPS1, LEU152PRO

In a Dutch family with Arts syndrome (301835) originally reported by
Arts et al. (1993), de Brouwer et al. (2007) found that the disorder was
associated with a 455T-C transition in exon 4 of the PRPS1 gene that
resulted in a leu152-to-pro (L152P) substitution.

.0012
ARTS SYNDROME
PRPS1, GLN133PRO

In an Australian family with Arts syndrome (301835), de Brouwer et al.
(2007) found that the disorder was caused by a 398A-C transversion in
exon 3 of the PRPS1 gene that resulted in a gln133-to-pro (Q133P)
substitution. Enzyme assays and molecular modeling demonstrated loss of
function of the mutant protein.

DEAFNESS, X-LINKED 1
PRPS1, ASP65ASN

In affected members of a large 5-generation Chinese family segregating
X-linked deafness-1 (304500), Liu et al. (2010) identified a 193G-A
transition in exon 2 of the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an asp65-to-asn
(D65N) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the alpha helix at
the N terminus. The mutation was not found in 1,025 ethnically matched
control chromosomes. Enzymatic activity assays showed reductions of
PRPS1 activity in patient erythrocytes of approximately 40 to 70% and in
patient fibroblasts of approximately 50 to 60% compared to controls.

PRPS1, ALA87THR

In affected members of a British American family segregating X-linked
deafness-1 (304500), previously reported by Tyson et al. (1996), Liu et
al. (2010) identified a 259G-A transition in exon 2 of the PRPS1 gene,
resulting in an ala87-to-thr (A87T) substitution at a highly conserved
residue. The mutation was not found in 1,475 Chinese control chromosomes
or 450 chromosomes of European descent.

PRPS1, GLY306ARG

In affected members of an American family segregating X-linked
deafness-1 (304500), previously reported by Manolis et al. (1999), Liu
et al. (2010) identified a 916G-A transition in exon 7 of the PRPS1
gene, resulting in a gly306-to-arg (G306R) substitution at a highly
conserved residue. The mutation was not found in 1,475 Chinese control
chromosomes or 450 chromosomes of European descent.

PRPS1, ILE290THR

In affected members from a Chinese family segregating X-linked
postlingual nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNX1; 304500), previously
reported by Cui et al. (2004), Liu et al. (2010) identified an 869T-C
transition in exon 7 of the PRPS1 gene, resulting in an ile290-to-thr
(I290T) substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was not
found in 1,025 ethnically matched control chromosomes.

.0017
ARTS SYNDROME AND PHOSPHORIBOSYLPYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHETASE SUPERACTIVITY
PRPS1, VAL142LEU

In a boy with a complex phenotype comprising Arts syndrome and PRPS1
superactivity (see 301835), Moran et al. (2012) identified a 424G-C
transversion in exon 4 of the PRPS1 gene, resulting in a val142-to-leu
(V142L) substitution at a highly conserved residue. Both the mother and
grandmother were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in
202 control alleles. The patient had developmental delay, hypotonia,
areflexia, motor neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and a Chiari I
malformation. Laboratory studies showed increased serum uric acid and
increased urinary hypoxanthine consistent with PRPS1 superactivity, but
he did not have gout. In addition, he had recurrent infections and early
death at age 27 months from infection, consistent with Arts syndrome. A
maternal uncle with similar symptoms had died of pneumonia at age 2.
Molecular modeling predicted that the substitution would disrupt
allosteric sites involved in inhibition of PRPS1, resulting in a gain of
enzyme function, and the ATP-binding site, resulting in a loss of enzyme
function. Patient fibroblasts showed normal PRPP synthetase activity,
whereas erythrocytes showed a loss of enzyme activity, suggesting that
the effect of the V142L mutation on protein activity depends on cell
type. Moran et al. (2012) postulated a gain-of-function effect in
proliferating cells and a loss-of-function effect in postmitotic cells.
The report indicated that PRPS1 missense mutations can cause a
continuous spectrum of features ranging from progressive nonsyndromic
postlingual hearing impairment to uric acid overproduction, neuropathy,
and recurrent infections depending on the functional sites affected.

library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned EXPH5, which they designated
KIAA0624. The deduced protein contains 1,983 amino acids. RT-PCR
detected highest EXPH5 expression in kidney, followed by lung, brain,
liver, and ovary. Little to no expression was detected in skeletal
muscle or spleen. Kuroda et al. (2002) showed that EXPH5, which they
called SLAC2B, contains an N-terminal synaptotagmin (see SYT1,
185605)-like homology domain (SHD).

By semiquantitative RT-PCR, McGrath et al. (2012) demonstrated
expression of EXPH5 in skin, muscle, heart, and brain. No amplification
was achieved from kidney, liver, or lung.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the EXPH5
gene to chromosome 11.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a protein pull-down assay, Kuroda et al. (2002) found that the
isolated N-terminal SHD of human SLAC2B and mouse Slp2a (SYTL2; 612880)
bound RAB27A (603868), but no other small GTP-binding protein examined.
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that full-length SLAC2B and
SLP2A interacted specifically with RAB27A following transfection of
COS-7 cells.

McGrath et al. (2012) examined the cytoskeletal architecture of
keratinocytes from patients with a truncating mutation in the EXPH5 gene
(612878.0001) compared to SLAC2B-knockdown control keratinocytes, and
observed disruption of the keratin filament network and more cortically
distributed F-actin in both compared to wildtype. Keratinocyte adhesion
assays demonstrated significantly reduced cell adhesion in both mutant
and knockdown keratinocytes compared to controls. SLAC2B was also
observed to colocalize with RAB27B (603869) and beta-4-integrin (147557)
to early adhesion initiation sites in spreading normal keratinocytes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous Iraqi family segregating
autosomal recessive inherited skin fragility (615028) with
clinicopathologic features that were not diagnostic for any particular
subtype of epidermolysis bullosa (see 601001) and who were negative for
mutation in the KRT5 (148040) and KRT14 (148066) genes, McGrath et al.
(2012) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (612878.0001) in the
EXPH5 gene.

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous Iraqi family with inherited
skin fragility (615028), McGrath et al. (2012) identified homozygosity
for a 1-bp deletion (5786delC) in exon 6 of the EXPH5 gene, causing a
frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination codon
truncating the protein by 52 residues (Pro1929LeufsX8). The mutation
segregated with disease in the family and was not found in 200 control
chromosomes from mixed Iraqi, Iranian, Kuwaiti, and Omani populations.
Patient keratinocytes showed disruption of the keratin filament network
and more cortically distributed F-actin as well as significantly reduced
cell adhesion compared to wildtype keratinocytes.

610813	TITLE *610813 HYDROCEPHALUS-INDUCING, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF, 2; HYDIN2
;;HYDIN, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF, 2;;
KIAA1864
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned HYDIN2, which they designated
KIAA1864. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate HYDIN2 expression in adult and
fetal brain, spinal cord, and all specific brain regions examined. Lower
expression was detected in lung, kidney, testis, and ovary, and little
to no expression was detected in other tissues examined.

By genomic sequence analysis, Doggett et al. (2006) identified a
duplicated copy of HYDIN (610812), HYDIN2, on chromosome 1. Database and
sequence analyses revealed HYDIN transcripts that had been isolated from
lung, testis, NT2 neuronal precursor cells, and Jurkat leukemic T cells,
whereas HYDIN2 transcripts had been isolated from brain and NT2 cells
only. Both genes appeared to be expressed as alternatively spliced
transcripts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Doggett et al. (2006) determined that the HYDIN2 gene contains 79 exons
and spans approximately 360 kb. It lacks the first 5 exons and last 2
exons of the HYDIN gene.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2001) mapped the HYDIN2
gene to both chromosome 1 and chromosome 16. By genomic sequence
analysis, Doggett et al. (2006) determined that the HYDIN2 gene maps to
chromosome 1q21.1 and is a duplicated copy of the HYDIN gene on
chromosome 16q22.2.

EVOLUTION

Using PCR and FISH, Doggett et al. (2006) confirmed that duplication of
the HYDIN gene is specific to humans. A large and diverse sample of
humans contained both HYDIN and HYDIN2, and there was no evidence for
polymorphic presence of HYDIN2.

Brunetti-Pierri et al. (2008) found that patients with 1q21 deletion
phenotype (612474) had microcephaly, whereas patients with
microduplication of this region (612475) had macrocephaly. They
postulated that dosage sensitivity of the HYDIN2 gene was responsible
for the variation in head circumference.

POPULATION GENETICS

By analyzing short-read mapping depth for 159 human genomes, Sudmant et
al. (2010) demonstrated accurate estimation of absolute copy number for
duplications as small as 1.9 kb pairs, ranging from 0 to 48 copies.
Sudmant et al. (2010) identified 4.1 million 'singly unique nucleotide'
positions informative in distinguishing specific copies and used them to
genotype the copy and content of specific paralogs within highly
duplicated gene families. These data identified human-specific
expansions in genes associated with brain development, such as GPRIN2
(611240) and SRGAP2 (606524), which have been implicated in neurite
outgrowth and branching. Also included were the brain-specific HYDIN2
gene, associated with micro- and macrocephaly; DRD5 (126453), a dopamine
D5 receptor; and the GTF2I (601679) transcription factors, whose
deletion has been associated with visual-spatial and sociability
deficits among Williams-Beuren syndrome (194050) patients, among others.
The data of Sudmant et al. (2010) also revealed extensive population
genetic diversity, especially among the genes NPEPPS (606793), UGT2B17
(601903), and NBPF1 (610501), as well as LILRA3 (604818), which is the
most highly stratified gene by copy number in the human genome. In
addition, Sudmant et al. (2010) detected signatures consistent with gene
conversion in the human species.

;;ALDO-KETO REDUCTASE 7; AKR7;;
AFLATOXIN B1-ALDEHYDE REDUCTASE; AFAR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Aldo-keto reductases, such as AKR7A2, are involved in the detoxification
of aldehydes and ketones.

CLONING

Ireland et al. (1998) used a rat aflatoxin B1-aldehyde reductase (AFAR)
cDNA and a human EST sequence to isolate human AFAR cDNAs from
cerebellum and liver libraries. The full-length cDNA encodes a 330-amino
acid polypeptide with 78% identity to rat AFAR, 22% identity to a
Shaker-related voltage-gated potassium channel, and 16% identity to
aldose reductase (103880). Northern blot analysis revealed that AFAR is
expressed in a wide range of human tissues.

By EST database analysis, Kelly et al. (2002) identified an AKR7A2
splice variant that encodes a deduced 359-amino acid protein with an
N-terminal extension.

GENE FUNCTION

Ireland et al. (1998) showed that expressed AFAR can metabolize
aflatoxin, but its specificity for some substrates differs from that of
rat AFAR. They showed that AFAR is the principal human liver reductase
for 2-carboxybenzaldehyde.

GENE STRUCTURE

Praml et al. (2003) determined that the AKR7A2 gene contains 7 exons and
spans 7.8 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Praml et al. (2003) mapped the
AKR7A2 gene to chromosome 1p36.1-p35, where it lies in a gene cluster
with the AKR7A3 (608477) and AKR7A4 (608478) genes. The genes are
oriented in a head-to-tail tandem arrangement,
distal-5-prime-AKR7A2-AKR7A3-AKR7A4-3-prime-proximal. AKR7A pseudogenes
are located on chromosomes Xq25 and 1p12. Praml et al. (2003) mapped the
mouse Akr7a2 gene to chromosome 5, where it is proximal to the Pla2g2a
gene (172411).

;;PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE, MAGNESIUM-DEPENDENT, 1, ALPHA ISOFORM;;
PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C, ALPHA ISOFORM; PP2CA;;
PP2C-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PPM1A is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is essential for
regulating cellular stress responses in eukaryotes. For further
background information on serine/threonine protein phosphatases, see
605119.

CLONING

By screening a human teratocarcinoma cDNA library with rat Pp2c-alpha as
the probe, Mann et al. (1992) cloned the human counterpart, PPM1A, which
they called PP2C-alpha. The PPM1A cDNA encodes a predicted 382-amino
acid peptide that shares 99.7% amino acid identity with rabbit
Pp2c-alpha.

In a genetic screen to identify protein phosphatases that negatively
regulate the p38 (600289) and JNK (see 601158) stress-activated MAPK
cascades, Takekawa et al. (1998) obtained a PP2C-alpha cDNA, which they
initially called MC4, that encodes a 324-amino acid peptide. The authors
hypothesized that MC4 is an alternative splicing product of PP2C-alpha.
The 2 proteins, which they termed PP2C-alpha-1 (382 amino acids) and
PP2C-alpha-2 (324 amino acids), differ at the C terminus. Northern blot
analysis detected 2.8- and 4.4-kb transcripts, which correspond to
PP2C-alpha-1 and PP2C-alpha-2, respectively. Both transcripts were
expressed at high levels in heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, and
pancreas, and the 4.4-kb transcript (PP2C-alpha-2) was detected in
brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Das et al. (1996) detected PPM1A in
both the cytoplasm and nucleus of mammalian cells, consistent with a
role in dephosphorylating components of stress-activated pathways.

By expressing PPM1A in mammalian cells, Takekawa et al. (1998)
demonstrated that PPM1A inhibits the activation of the stress-responsive
p38 and JNK MAPK cascades. Their in vivo and in vitro observations
indicated that PPM1A dephosphorylates and inactivates MAPKKs (MKK6
(601254) and SEK1 (601335)) and a MAPK (p38) in the stress-responsive
MAPK cascades. Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, the authors
demonstrated that PPM1A directly interacts with p38.

A key step in TGF-beta (TGFB1; 190180) signaling is ligand-induced
phosphorylation of receptor-activated SMADs (see SMAD2; 601366). Using a
functional genomic approach, Lin et al. (2006) identified human PPM1A as
a SMAD phosphatase. PPM1A dephosphorylated and promoted nuclear export
of TGF-beta-activated SMAD2 and SMAD3 (603109) in human cells. Ectopic
expression of PPM1A abolished TGF-beta-induced antiproliferative and
transcriptional responses, whereas depletion of PPM1A enhanced TGF-beta
signaling in human and other mammalian cells. In zebrafish,
Smad-antagonizing activity of Ppm1a was observed during Nodal
(601265)-dependent early embryogenesis. Lin et al. (2006) concluded that
PPM1A plays a critical role in TGF-beta signaling through
dephosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Das et al. (1996) determined the crystal structure of PPM1A, which they
called PP2C. The structure revealed a novel protein fold with a
catalytic domain composed of a central beta sandwich that binds 2
manganese ions, which is surrounded by alpha helices. The authors stated
that the protein architecture and deduced catalytic mechanism are
similar to the PP1, PP2A, and PP2B family of protein ser/thr
phosphatases.

CLONING

Levedakou et al. (1994) used degenerate PCR to clone a novel
serine/threonine protein kinase, termed STK2, from a human breast
carcinoma cell line. The gene encodes an 841-amino acid polypeptide.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the STK2 gene is expressed as 2
mRNAs of 4.0 kb and 6.8 kb in heart and several other tissues. Levedakou
et al. (1994) noted that levels of STK2 mRNA remain invariant throughout
the cell cycle.

;;NITROGEN-FIXING BACTERIA S, HOMOLOG OF; NIFS;;
CYSTEINE DESULFURASE;;
ISCS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are prosthetic groups found in respiratory
chain complexes and numerous mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes.
Assembly of Fe-S clusters requires cysteine desulfurases, such as NFS1,
as well as scaffold proteins, iron donors, and chaperones (Li et al.,
2006).

CLONING

Using sequence homology to bacterial NifS, Land and Rouault (1998)
cloned the human homolog of NifS, a cysteine desulfurase that is
proposed to supply the inorganic sulfur in iron-sulfur clusters. In
human cells, different forms of NIFS that localize either to
mitochondria or to the cytosol and nucleus are synthesized from a single
transcript through initiation at alternative in-frame AUGs, and
initiation site selection varies according to the pH of the medium or
cytosol. Thus, this form of translational regulation permits rapid
redistribution of NIFS proteins into different compartments of the cell
in response to changes in metabolic status.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (2006) overexpressed the cytosolic isoform of human ISCS in
yeast and showed that it was an active cysteine desulfurase that
converted cysteine to alanine and covalently bound sulfur in a
persulfide. Cytosolic ISCS homodimerized and formed a complex in vitro
with overexpressed human cytosolic ISCU (611911). When incubated with
iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP1, or ACO1; 100880), cysteine, and iron,
the cytosolic isoforms of ISCS and ISCU facilitated efficient formation
of a 4Fe-4S cluster on IRP1.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NFS1
gene to chromosome 20pter-p12.3 (TMAP SGC32196).

158374	TITLE *158374 MUCIN 6, GASTRIC; MUC6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MUC6 gene encodes gastric mucin, a secreted glycoprotein that plays
an essential role in epithelial cytoprotection from acid, proteases,
pathogenic microorganisms, and mechanical trauma in the gastrointestinal
tract (summary by Toribara et al., 1993).

CLONING

By expression cloning, Toribara et al. (1993) isolated cDNAs coding for
human gastric mucin. Expression of the gene was highest in the stomach
and gallbladder, with weaker expression in the terminal ileum and right
colon.

Reid and Harris (1998) used tissue in situ hybridization to study MUC6
gene expression in midtrimester human fetal gut. MUC6 mRNA was detected
at low levels in the small intestine between 13 and 23 weeks' gestation.
Abundant MUC6 mRNA was detected in gastric neck mucous cells, in
contrast with MUC5AC (158373). MUC6 mRNA was present at high levels in
pancreatic ductal epithelium throughout the midtrimester.

Rousseau et al. (2004) described the domain structure of human MUC6.
MUC6 contains an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by several von
Willebrand factor (VWF; 613160)-like domains, a large tandem repeat
domain, and a C-terminal cystine knot domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Sekine et al. (2006) found that expression of HATH1 (ATOH1; 601461) was
lost in 5 of 8 gastric cancer (GC) cell lines examined, whereas normal
gastric mucosa expressed HATH1. Expression of the gastric mucin genes
MUC6 and MUC5AC showed a correlation with that of HATH1 in most GC cell
lines. Overexpression of Math1, a mouse HATH1 homolog, in GC cells
strongly enhanced MUC6 and MUC5AC mRNA levels. RNA interference-mediated
downregulation of HATH1 in GC cells led to decreased expression of the
mucin genes. Sekine et al. (2006) concluded that HATH1 is a
transcriptional regulator for MUC5AC and MUC6 in GC cells and that HATH1
loss may be involved in gastric carcinogenesis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rousseau et al. (2004) determined that the MUC6 gene contains 30 5-prime
exons, 1 large central exon containing the tandem repeat domain, and 2
3-prime exons.

Kwon et al. (2010) noted that the MUC6 gene contains 35 exons and spans
about 24 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Toribara et al. (1993) mapped the
MUC6 gene to chromosome 11p15.5-p15.4. Two other mucin genes (MUC2,
158370; MUC5AC, 158373) have been mapped to the 11p15 region, suggesting
a clustering of secretory mucin genes.

Rousseau et al. (2004) determined that the MUC6 and MUC2 genes are
located 38.5 kb apart in a head-to-head orientation within a gene
complex on chromosome 11p15.5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kwon et al. (2010) identified 5 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)
minisatellite polymorphisms in the MUC6 gene, which they termed MS1 to
MS5. MS1 and MS2 are located in the promoter region, MS3 in intron 1,
MS4 in intron 8, and MS5 in intron 26. All were shown to be meiotically
stable and subject to mendelian inheritance. Among 470 Korean patients
with gastric cancer (137215) and 1,103 controls, there was no difference
in the frequency of alleles for MS1 to MS4. However, there was a
significant association between the rare MS5 short alleles and gastric
cancer (p = 0.005; OR, 7.08), particularly for poorly differentiated
gastric cancer. An analysis of 700 gastric cancer cases showed that
those with short alleles lacked MUC6 gene expression. The MS5 region
contained several putative transcription factor binding sites, and
studies of transfected cells showed that the short MS5 allele
significantly decreased reporter gene expression. These findings
suggested that susceptibility to gastric cancer may be related to
variation in MUC6 gene expression.

614555	TITLE *614555 FERM DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6; FRMD6
;;WILLIN;;
CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 31; C14ORF31
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins containing a 4.1 (see 130500)-ezrin (VIL2; 123900)-radixin
(RDX; 179410)-moesin (MSN; 309845) (FERM) domain, such as FRMD6, are
frequently involved in maintaining the cytoskeleton (Gunn-Moore et al.,
2005).

CLONING

By searching databases for orthologs of a rat protein that interacted
with neurofascin (609145), Gunn-Moore et al. (2005) identified human
FRMD6, which they called Willin after William Dick, founder of the Royal
(Dick) School Veterinary College, University of Edinburgh. The deduced
614-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 71 kD and
contains an N-terminal FERM domain. The rat and human proteins share 91%
identity. Database analysis revealed Willin expression in human brain,
heart, liver, prostate, and lung. Northern blot analysis detected rat
Willin in sciatic nerve, but not in brain. Immunohistochemical staining
of normal human oral mucosa and squamous cell carcinoma and expression
of fluorescence-tagged Willin in mammalian cell lines showed that Willin
could exist in both the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, in either a
punctate distribution or in a perinuclear location. Willin accumulated
at points of cell contact in both HEK293 and rat PC12 pheochromocytoma
cells and at cleavage furrows of dividing HEK293 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Gunn-Moore et al. (2005) found that epitope-tagged Willin bound the same
phospholipids as moesin, namely phosphoinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P),
PI(4)P, and PI(5)P, but not PI(3,4)P2 or other phospholipids tested.
Willin relocalized from the cytoplasm to the membrane in rat PC12 cells
following treatment with EGF (131530) or NGF (see 162030), but this
redistribution of Willin was not seen in transfected HEK293 or COS-7
cells. Inhibitor studies showed that growth factor-dependent
redistribution of Willin in PC12 cells was not dependent upon PI3 kinase
(see 601232) activity or actin.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the FRMD6 gene to chromosome 14q22.1 based on an
alignment of the FRMD6 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK055545) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

602435	TITLE *602435 PEPTIDYL-PROLYL ISOMERASE E; PPIE
;;CYCLOPHILIN, 33-KD; CYP33;;
CYCLOPHILIN E
DESCRIPTION The cyclophilins (CYPs) are a conserved family of peptidyl-prolyl
cis-trans isomerases (PPIases; see 123840) that bind the
immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA).

CLONING

Mi et al. (1996) used degenerate PCR to identify the sequences of novel
cyclophilins expressed in Jurkat T cells. They subsequently cloned a
novel cDNA whose sequence encodes a 301-amino acid polypeptide of
molecular mass 33 kD, termed CYP33 by them. Sequence analysis revealed
that the encoded protein contains an N-terminal RNA-binding domain and a
C-terminal CYP domain. Expression studies showed that the CYP33 protein
exhibits RNA-binding activity, PPIase activity, and protein folding
activity. The PPIase activity of CYP33 is inhibited by CsA with kinetics
similar to other CYPs. Northern blotting of T-cell mRNA revealed
expression of a low abundance 1.6-kb CYP33 transcript. Mi et al. (1996)
stated that CYP33 is the first example of a protein that combines
RNA-binding and PPIase activities.

While characterizing aberrant LMYC (164850) transcripts in a small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) cell line, Kim et al. (1998) detected a novel
transcript. By searching an EST database, they determined that the novel
sequence had greatest identity with PPIases. Using the 5-prime end of
the sequence, which they called PPIE, as a probe to screen a human
skeletal muscle cDNA library, they obtained a cDNA encoding a 301-amino
acid protein that is identical to CYP33. Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of a major 1.4-kb transcript in some but not all SCLC lines.

MAPPING

By Southern blot and somatic cell hybrid analysis, Kim et al. (1998)
mapped the PPIE gene to an 800-kb fragment of chromosome 1p32 between
LMYC (164850) and RLF (180610).

614075	TITLE #614075 HERMANSKY-PUDLAK SYNDROME 6; HPS6
DESCRIPTION A number sign (#) is used with this entry because this form of
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS6) is caused by homozygous or compound
heterozygosity for mutation in the HPS6 gene (607522) on chromosome
10q24.32.

For a phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity
of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, see HPS1, 203300.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Zhang et al. (2003) described a 39-year-old Belgian woman with
Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome-6. She had oculocutaneous albinism and
frequent prolonged nosebleeds, as well as prolonged bleeding after
dental extractions and surgery. She had no pulmonary or gastrointestinal
symptoms. Her platelet count was normal, and her bleeding time was
moderately prolonged. Platelet function test showed reduced secretion in
response to ATP. Electron microscopy of her platelets showed only very
rare dense granules. Her parents had no known consanguinity, but both
were from the same small region of east Flanders. A brother was
similarly affected.

Schreyer-Shafir et al. (2006) studied a large consanguineous Israeli
Bedouin family in which the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome phenotype was
characterized mainly by oculocutaneous albinism. Electron microscopic
studies of platelets showed absence of dense bodies, consistent with
HPS, and confocal microscopy revealed abnormal distribution of LAMP3
(605883) in patient fibroblasts, indicating abnormal trafficking of
lysosomal-related organelles. The findings expanded the phenotype
associated with mutations in the HPS6 gene.

Huizing et al. (2009) described 4 patients with Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome-6. The first was a 36-year-old woman of Irish and German
descent who was found to have partial albinism and nystagmus at age 5
months, but diagnosis was not made until age 26 when bleeding
complications were followed up, revealing an absence of platelet dense
bodies. She also had multiple abdominal surgeries for hernia,
imperforate anus, and gluteal flap repairs. She had other medical
problems, including 4 miscarriages, endometriosis, frequent upper
respiratory and urinary tract infections, incontinence, migraine
headaches, and hearing loss. However, she did not have granulomatous
colitis, and renal and pulmonary functions were normal. The second
patient was a 22-year-old man of northern European descent who had
nystagmus at birth and was diagnosed with oculocutaneous albinism at age
3 months. Although bruising and bleeding after trauma were noted in
childhood, he was not diagnosed with HPS until age 16 years, when
laboratory studies showed absence of platelet dense granules. There was
no renal or lung disease. The third was a 13-year-old girl of German and
Dutch descent who had rotary nystagmus in infancy and was diagnosed with
oculocutaneous albinism. She had global delayed development and easy
bruising. Platelet storage pool deficiency and absence of dense bodies
were noted at age 4 years. The fourth patient, a 52-year-old Italian
man, also had rotary nystagmus at birth and bruising in childhood. He
was diagnosed at age 44 years only when he was found to have
gastrointestinal symptoms and oculocutaneous albinism. Laboratory
studies showed iron-deficiency anemia and low vitamin B12. There was no
interstitial lung disease or renal involvement. Huizing et al. (2009)
concluded that patients with HPS6 appear to have clinical features
similar to those of other BLOC2-deficient patients, that is, patients
with HPS3 (614072) and HPS5 (614074).

MAPPING

Zhang et al. (2003) mapped the HPS6 gene to chromosome 10q24.32.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 39-year-old Belgian woman with HPS, Zhang et al. (2003) identified
a homozygous 4-bp deletion (607522.0001) in the HPS6 gene.

Huizing et al. (2009) identified homozygous or compound heterozygous
mutations (607522.0003-607522.0007) in the HPS6 gene in 4 unrelated
patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. All mutations except 1 resulted
in a truncated protein. The phenotype was characterized by early-onset
nystagmus, oculocutaneous albinism, and a mild bleeding diathesis, but
no pulmonary fibrosis, granulomatous colitis, or renal involvement.
However, 2 patients had gastrointestinal symptoms. In vitro cellular
studies performed on patient melanocytes indicated aberrant cytoplasmic
distribution patterns of melanogenic proteins and increased trafficking
of TYRP1 (115501) through the plasma membrane, indicating a defect in
lysosomal-related organelles.

610171	TITLE *610171 CALMODULIN-LIKE 6; CALML6
;;CALGLANDULIN-LIKE PROTEIN; CAGLP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By EST database searching with the sequence of the 4-EF hand-containing
calglandulin protein in Bothrops insularis snake as query, followed by
PCR analysis, Chen et al. (2004) cloned human CALML6, which they called
CAGLP, from skeletal muscle. The deduced 181-amino acid protein contains
4 EF-hand motifs and shares 80% sequence identity with the snake
protein. RT-PCR analysis detected a single transcript at highest levels
in skeletal muscle but also in prostate, thymus, heart, bone marrow, and
ovary. Western blot analysis of a CAGLP-EGFP fusion product in HeLa
cells showed that CAGLP has a molecular mass of 19 kD. Fluorescence
microscopy localized the CAGLP-EGFP fusion protein throughout the cell,
with a higher accumulation in cytoplasm than in the nucleus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chen et al. (2004) determined that the CAGLP gene contains 6 exons. They
found some evidence of a shorter splice variant lacking the second exon,
but the predicted shorter transcript was not detected in RT-PCR
analysis.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chen et al. (2004) mapped the CAGLP gene
to chromosome 1p36.33.

134650	TITLE *134650 FATTY ACID-BINDING PROTEIN 1; FABP1
;;FATTY ACID-BINDING PROTEIN, LIVER; FABPL;;
Z PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION Fatty acid-binding protein is an abundant constituent of the cytoplasm
that regulates lipid transport and metabolism. It binds free fatty
acids, their CoA derivatives, bilirubin, organic anions, and other small
molecules. See also FABP2 (134640), FABP3 (134651), and FABP4 (600434).
Liver fatty acid-binding protein is required for cholesterol synthesis
and metabolism. Chen et al. (1986) used cDNA of liver FABP in Southern
analysis of human/mouse cell hybrid DNA and assigned the FABPL locus to
2p. Sparkes et al. (1987) confirmed the assignment to chromosome 2 and
regionalized the gene to 2p11 by in situ hybridization. Sweetser et al.
(1987) found that the mouse homolog of this gene is located on
chromosome 6, within 3 cM of the lymphocyte antigen-2 (Ly-2) locus. They
suggested that the liver form of FABP may be identical to the major
liver protein-1 (Lvp-1), which is encoded by a gene situated within 1 cM
of Ly-2.

;;SMALL EDRK-RICH FACTOR 1; SERF1;;
SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY-RELATED GENE H4F5; H4F5;;
SMA MODIFIER 1; SMAM1
DESCRIPTION Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been classified into 3 types based on
age of onset and severity. SMA I-III all map to 5q13, and nearly all
patients display deletions or gene conversions of the SMN1 gene
(600354). Although some correlation has been established between SMN
protein levels and disease course, the genetic basis for SMA phenotypic
variability is mainly unexplained, and it had been postulated that the
loss of an additional modifying factor contributes to the severity of
type I SMA. Scharf et al. (1998) found that a multicopy microsatellite
marker deleted in more than 90% of type I SMA chromosomes was embedded
in an intron of H4F5, indicating that this gene is also highly deleted
in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier
for SMA. The microsatellite marker, designated C212, is located in the
last intron of H4F5, 5 kb upstream of H4F5 exon 3b and 13 kb upstream of
SMN exon 1. In 58 type I SMA patients of varied European and Arabian
descent, Scharf et al. (1998) found a reduction or absence of C212/H4F5
alleles in 94% of chromosomes, implying a deletion of 1 or both copies
of the marker and therefore of H4F5 exon 3b in these individuals. In
comparison with the high rate of C212/H4F5 deletions in type I SMA, the
C212 deletion frequency in type II SMA chromosomes was between that of
type I and control chromosomes, whereas deletions in type III
chromosomes were only slightly more frequent than in controls.

Scharf et al. (1998) sequenced a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
containing the mouse Smn gene to identify conserved elements between the
human SMA interval and its previously identified syntenic region on
mouse chromosome 13 (Scharf et al., 1996). The resulting sequence was
filtered for repetitive elements and used to screen the EST database.
ESTs corresponding to SMN and NAIP were identified as well as 2 ESTs
representing novel genes within the BAC. One of these ESTs, clone
368449, mapped to 10.6 kb upstream of mouse Smn; subsequent analysis of
surrounding genomic sequences using 4 exon-prediction programs
identified no additional transcripts between 368449 and Smn or between
Smn and Naip. The full-length 566-bp mouse 368449 cDNA and its human
ortholog were cloned from a mouse brain and human skeletal muscle cDNA
library, respectively. The human clone was 99% homologous to exon 4F5,
an exon previously trapped from an SMA cosmid known to contain SMN exon
1. The full-length human cDNA was named H4F5, and its mouse counterpart
M4f5, until an appropriate function can be assigned to the 2 genes. The
proteins displayed 97% amino acid similarity to one another and both
genes were ubiquitously expressed with highest RNA levels in testis. In
addition, H4F5 has a larger 1.8-kb isoform, H4F5L, with a predicted
110-amino acid open reading frame that results from alternative splicing
of exon 3. In contrast to the 0.6-kb mouse and 0.7-kb human 4F5S
isoforms, the 1.8-kb H4F5L transcript is predominantly expressed in
heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Both isoforms are also expressed
throughout the central nervous system, including spinal cord, which is
the tissue primarily affected in SMA. H4F5 was found to lie closer to
SMN1 than any previously identified gene in the region.

612733	TITLE *612733 THO COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 5; THOC5
;;FMS-INTERACTING PROTEIN; FMIP;;
PK1.3;;
FSAP79
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In yeast, the TREX (transcription/export) complex contains the THO
transcription elongation complex, which functions in cotranscriptional
recruitment of mRNA export proteins to the nascent transcript. The human
TREX complex contains ALY (THOC4; 604171), UAP56 (DDX39B; 142560), and
the human counterpart of the THO complex, which includes THOC5. The
human TREX complex appears to be recruited to spliced mRNAs late in the
splicing reaction rather than by direct cotranscriptional recruitment,
as in yeast (Masuda et al., 2005).

CLONING

Using exon amplification to identify genes in a region of chromosome 22
associated with meningioma (607174), followed by screening a fetal brain
cDNA library, Xie et al. (1993) cloned THOC5, which they called PK1.3.
The deduced 683-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
78.5 kD. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in skeletal
muscle, followed by heart and pancreas. A 10-kb transcript was also
detected in brain, placenta, and skeletal muscle.

Tamura et al. (1999) cloned mouse Thoc5, which they called Fmip. Mouse
and human THOC5 share 95.6% amino acid identity. Both contain a central
WW domain-binding motif, followed by an acidic region with 3 potential
phosphorylation sites, and a leucine zipper with 4 heptad repeats. They
also have 2 clusters of basic residues that may act as nuclear
localization signals. Northern blot analysis detected Thoc5 in all mouse
tissues examined, with highest expression in testis, liver, and heart.
Among human fetal tissues, THOC5 was highly expressed in kidney and
liver, with lower expression in lung and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and in vitro protein interaction assays,
Tamura et al. (1999) showed that the N-terminal domain of mouse and
human FMIP interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of activated FMS
(CSF1R; 164770), a tyrosine kinase that functions as a receptor for
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF, or CSF1; 120420). Binding
induced rapid FMS-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FMIP within its
FMS-binding domain, which was followed by dissociation of the 2
molecules. FMIP did not interact with other receptor tyrosine kinases
examined. MCSF treatment induced a bipotential mouse myeloid progenitor
cell line to differentiate into macrophages, but MCSF stimulation in the
presence of overexpressed FMIP induced the same cells to differentiate
into granulocytes. Tamura et al. (1999) concluded that the level of FMIP
determines the differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells into either
macrophages or granulocytes.

Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis of HeLa cell
nuclear extracts, Masuda et al. (2005) found that the human TREX complex
contained THO2 (THOC2; 300395), FSAP79 (THOC5), HPR1 (THOC1; 606930),
UAP56, TEX1 (THOC3; 606929), FSAP35 (THOC6; 615403), ALY, and FSAP24
(THOC7; 611965). Immunodepletion and gel-filtration analyses revealed
that THO2, HPR1, FSAP79, FSAP35, and FSAP24 were tightly associated in
the THO complex, whereas UAP56, ALY, and TEX1 were more loosely
associated. Immunoprecipitation of any TREX component efficiently
immunoprecipitated spliced mRNA and cDNA transcripts, but not unspliced
pre-mRNAs. Immunodepletion of any component had no effect on spliceosome
assembly, splicing, or RNA stability. The TREX complex assembled on
every mRNA examined. Mutation analysis showed that the C terminus of ALY
was required for binding of both UAP56 and the THO complex. The C
terminus of UAP56 was sufficient for ALY binding. The N terminus of
UAP56 interacted weakly with the THO complex and TEX1, suggesting that
other regions of UAP56 are required for maximal binding. Masuda et al.
(2005) concluded that recruitment of the human TREX complex is not
directly coupled to transcription, as in yeast.

Pierce et al. (2008) showed that expression of the human oncogenic
fusion protein TEL (ETV6; 600618)/PDGFRB (173410) in murine myeloid
FDCP-Mix cells increased the expression and phosphorylation of Thoc5.
Inhibition of TEL/PDGFRB with imatinib partially reversed Thoc5
upregulation. Elevated Thoc5 expression led to increased levels of
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3), suggesting that the
elevated PtdInsP3 levels observed with TEL/PDGFRB expression were due,
at least in part, to Thoc5 upregulation. Thoc5 upregulation also
decreased apoptosis, whereas knockdown of Thoc5 via small interfering
RNA led to rapid cell death. TEL/PDGFRB and several other leukemogenic
tyrosine kinases phosphorylated Thoc5 on tyr225.

Carney et al. (2009) showed that MCSF-stimulated maturation of a mouse
myelogenous leukemia cell line was associated with enhanced Thoc5
expression and phosphorylation. Thoc5 also formed a complex with
Cebp-beta (CEBPB; 189965). Ectopic expression of human THOC5 mimicked
MCSF-mediated cell maturation and enhanced the expression of several
myeloid transcription factors, including CEBP-beta. Increased THOC5
expression also mimicked the MCSF-stimulated increase in PtdInsP3.
Inhibition of the THOC5-induced increase in PtdInsP3 abrogated the
effects of elevated Cebp-beta. Carney et al. (2009) concluded that THOC5
stabilizes transcription factors to potentiate monocytic cell line
development.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xie et al. (1993) estimated that the THOC5 gene spans 100 to 150 kb.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and analysis of a YAC and cosmid contig,
Xie et al. (1993) mapped the THOC5 gene to chromosome 22q12, adjacent
and centromeric to the NF2 gene (607379).

ANIMAL MODEL

Using Thoc5-knockout mice, Pierce et al. (2008) showed that Thoc5 was
required to maintain hematopoietic cells in vivo.

109700	TITLE *109700 BETA-2-MICROGLOBULIN; B2M
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Beta-2-microglobulin is a serum protein found in association with the
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I heavy chain on the
surface of nearly all nucleated cells (Gussow et al., 1987).

CLONING

Cunningham et al. (1973) reported the complete amino acid sequence of
the beta-2-microglobulin protein. It is a single polypeptide chain with
a molecular mass of 11.6 kD that shows homology to immunoglobulins and
HLA, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.

Suggs et al. (1981) isolated a partial cDNA clone corresponding to the
B2M gene. The mature protein is predicted to contain 99 amino acids.

Gussow et al. (1987) isolated a full-length clone corresponding to the
human B2M gene from a human lymphoblastoid cell cDNA library. The
deduced 99-residue protein shows 70% amino acid sequence similarity to
the mouse protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gussow et al. (1987) determined that the B2M gene contains 4 exons and
spans approximately 8 kb.

MAPPING

Goodfellow et al. (1975) and Smith et al. (1975) mapped the B2M gene to
chromosome 15 by somatic cell hybridization.

Manolov et al. (1979) reported that the Daudi lymphoblastoid cell line,
which is derived from Burkitt lymphoma (113970) and lacks both HLA
antigens and beta-2-microglobulin, has 1 normal chromosome 15 and 1 with
a deletion of 15q12-q21. Using high resolution banding techniques, Zhang
and Zech (1981) concluded that the abnormal chromosome 15 in the Daudi
cell line is del(15)(q13q15).

Cox et al. (1982) assigned the mouse B2m gene to mouse chromosome 2,
which is syntenic to human chromosome 15, and suggested that B2M is not
linked to major histocompatibility or immunoglobulin loci.

GENE FUNCTION

Arce-Gomez et al. (1978) made somatic cell hybrids between the Daudi
lymphoblastoid cell line and a human cell line derived from HeLa and
also showing no HLA antigens. The hybrid cells did express HLA antigens.
Since Daudi cells do not express B2M despite the presence of a
chromosome 15, reexpression in the hybrid cells was thought to be due to
provision of beta-2-microglobulin by the other parental cell line. The
experiment showed that beta-2-microglobulin is essential to expression
of HLA.

On the basis of molecular cloning studies, Margulies et al. (1983)
suggested that the Ly-m11 antigenic determinant demonstrated on
lymphocytes by a monoclonal antibody is on the B2M molecule.

The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is a heterodimer of a nonclassical MHC
class I alpha chain (FCGRT; 601437) and B2M that binds the 2 most
abundant serum proteins, IgG and albumin (ALB; 103600), after their
constitutive cellular uptake. FcRn binds both proteins, thus acting as a
salvage pathway, protecting them from lysosomal degradation and
extending the catabolic half-lives of both proteins (Wani et al., 2006).

- Disease Associations

Like immunoglobulins, prealbumin, and the beta protein (APP; 104760)
found in the amyloid of Alzheimer disease (104300), beta-2-microglobulin
has a predominantly beta-pleated sheet structure that may adopt the
fibrillar configuration of amyloid in certain pathologic states
(Cunningham et al., 1973).

Beta-2-microglobulin had been found in the serum of normal individuals
and in the urine in elevated amounts in patients with Wilson disease
(277900), cadmium poisoning, and other conditions leading to renal
tubular dysfunction (Berggard and Bearn, 1968).

Hemodialysis-related amyloidosis (HRA) is a form of systemic amyloidosis
with a predilection for the synovium and bone that occurs with a
disturbingly high frequency among patients on long-term hemodialysis.
The clinical features include carpal tunnel syndrome, erosive
arthropathy, spondyloarthropathy, lytic bone lesions, and pathologic
fractures. Gejyo et al. (1985) found that protein that accumulates in
amyloid-laden tissue obtained from a chronic hemodialysis patient with
carpal tunnel syndrome was identical to B2M in several characteristics.
Connors et al. (1985) demonstrated the in vitro creation of amyloid
fibers from B2M. Gorevic et al. (1985, 1986) reported the amino acid
sequence of the HRA subunit protein and identified it as
beta-2-microglobulin. The occurrence of amyloidosis in these patients
can be prevented by periodic use of high-permeability membranes or
intermittent hemofiltration.

Charra et al. (1984) reported that 38 of 52 patients receiving
hemodialysis for more than 8 years for chronic renal failure not due to
amyloid nephropathy developed carpal tunnel syndrome. Tissues excised at
surgical decompression contained amyloid. In 95% of these patients,
shoulder pain, which was presumed to be due to amyloid deposits, was
present. McClure et al. (1986) demonstrated the beta-2-microglobulin
nature of the amyloid in 3 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome
requiring decompression surgery after long-term hemodialysis treatment
for chronic renal failure not due to amyloid nephropathy. Zingraff et
al. (1990) described a patient with severe renal insufficiency who had
beta-2-microglobulin amyloidosis despite the fact that dialysis had
never been performed. The authors suggested that some B2M variants are
more amyloidogenic than others.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Some tumors lack cell surface expression of HLA class I molecules and
this may be one mechanism by which tumor cells escape immune recognition
by cytotoxic T cells. In some cases, there is loss of the heavy chain
surface expression encoded by the HLA-A, -B, and -C genes which is
responsible; in other cases, expression of the B2M gene for the light
chain is responsible. The Daudi lymphoblastoid cell line, derived from a
patient with Burkitt lymphoma and lacking both HLA antigens and beta-2
microglobulin, fails to express HLA class I molecules because of a
specific defect in the B2M component. In the Daudi cell line, Rosa et
al. (1983) demonstrated a G-to-C transversion in the initiator ATG
sequence of the B2M gene, predicted to change the initiator methionine
residue to isoleucine.

In the human melanoma cell line FO-1, D'Urso et al. (1991) found that
the lack of expression of HLA class I antigens was the result of a
defect in the B2M gene: a deletion of the first exon of the 5-prime
flanking region and of a segment of the first intron.

Bicknell et al. (1994) used single-strand conformation polymorphism
(SSCP) analysis to screen a series of 37 established colorectal cell
lines, 22 fresh tumor samples, and 22 normal DNA samples for mutations
in the B2M gene. Exon 1 (including the leader peptide sequence) and exon
2 were screened separately. Mutations were found in 6 of 7 colorectal
cell lines and 1 of 22 fresh tumors, whereas no mutations were detected
in the normal DNA samples. Sequencing of these mutations showed that an
8-bp CT repeat in the leader peptide sequence was particularly variable,
since 3 of the cell lines and 1 fresh tumor sample had deletions in this
region. In 2 related colorectal cell lines, DLD-1 and HCT-15, 2 similar
mutations were identified, a C-to-A substitution in codon 10 and a
G-to-T mutation in the splice sequence of intron 1. Expression of
beta-2-microglobulin was examined using a series of monoclonal
antibodies in an ELISA system. Reduced expression correlated with a
mutation in 1 allele of the B2M gene, whereas loss of expression was
seen in instances where a line was homozygous for a mutation or
heterozygous for 2 mutations.

- Familial Hypercatabolic Hypoproteinemia

In 2 sibs with familial hypercatabolic hypoproteinemia (241600)
originally reported by Waldmann (1969), Wani et al. (2006) identified a
homozygous mutation in the B2M gene (109700.0001). The findings were
consistent with the hypothesis that FcRn, which contains B2M, binds IgG
and albumin and serves to salvage both proteins.

- Familial Visceral Amyloidosis

In 4 affected members of a family with autosomal dominant visceral
amyloidosis (105200), Valleix et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the B2M gene (D76N; 109700.0002). Studies on the recombinant
D76N protein showed reduced stability of the fully folded mutant protein
and significantly increased conversion of the mutant protein into
fibrils with amyloid-like properties under physiologic conditions,
whereas the wildtype protein did not aggregate at all. In mid-adult
life, the patients developed slowly progressive chronic diarrhea with
weight loss and sicca syndrome. One had sensorimotor axonal
polyneuropathy and orthostatic hypotension and 2 had severe autonomic
neuropathy. Valleix et al. (2012) noted that the amyloid deposition in
this family was different from that observed in dialysis-related
amyloidosis, in which B2M-amyloid accumulates around bones and joints.
In addition, serum B2M was not increased in the patients with familial
disease, whereas it is increased in those with dialysis-related
amyloidosis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Allelic variation in the B2m gene has been reported in the mouse
(Robinson et al., 1981).

Class I MHC molecules, known to be important for immune responses to
antigen, are expressed also by neurons that undergo activity-dependent,
long-term structural and synaptic modifications. Huh et al. (2000)
showed that in mice genetically deficient for cell surface class I MHC,
due to deletion of either TAP1 (170260) or beta-2-microglobulin, or for
a class I MHC receptor component, CD3-zeta (186780), refinement of
connections between retina and central targets during development is
incomplete. In the hippocampus of adult mutants, N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor-dependent long-term potentiation is enhanced, and long-term
depression is absent. Specific class I MHC mRNAs are expressed by
distinct mosaics of neurons, reflecting a potential for diverse neuronal
functions. These results demonstrated an important role for these
molecules in the activity-dependent remodeling and plasticity of
connections in the developing and mature mammalian central nervous
system.

The defect in hereditary hemochromatosis (235200) resides in the HFE
gene (613609) in the class I MHC region. This fact lends significance to
the findings of de Sousa et al. (1994), who reported a comparative
histologic and quantitative analysis of iron distribution in the tissues
of mice homozygous and heterozygous for knockout of the
beta-2-microglobulin gene. Progressive hepatic iron overload,
indistinguishable from that observed in human hemochromatosis, was found
only in mice homozygous for the mutated B2M gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
HYPOPROTEINEMIA, HYPERCATABOLIC
B2M, ALA11PRO

In 2 sibs with familial hypercatabolic hypoproteinemia (241600)
originally reported by Waldmann (1969), Wani et al. (2006) identified a
homozygous 913G-C transversion in exon 1 of the B2M gene, resulting in
an ala11-to-pro (A11P) substitution at the midpoint of the signal
sequence. Both sibs had B2M serum levels that were less than 1.0% of
normal as well as soluble HLA levels that were less than 0.2% of normal.
Transfection studies showed that the mutant B2M gene resulted in reduced
expression of the B2M, MHC class I, and FcRn proteins.

.0002
AMYLOIDOSIS, FAMILIAL VISCERAL
B2M, ASP76ASN

In 4 affected members of a family with autosomal dominant visceral
amyloidosis (105200), Valleix et al. (2012) identified a heterozygous
286G-A transition in the B2M gene, resulting in an asp76-to-asn (D76N)
substitution. Studies on the recombinant D76N protein showed reduced
stability of the fully folded mutant protein and significantly increased
conversion of the mutant protein into fibrils with amyloid-like
properties under physiologic conditions, whereas the wildtype protein
did not aggregate at all. Although the high-resolution crystal structure
of the mutant protein was similar to wildtype, the D76N substitution has
2 notable effects: establishment of new hydrogen bonds and increase of
the isoelectric point. In mid-adult life, the patients developed slowly
progressive chronic diarrhea with weight loss and sicca syndrome. One
had sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy and orthostatic hypotension and 2
had severe autonomic neuropathy. Postmortem examination of 1 patient,
who died at age 70 years, showed extensive B2M-containing amyloid
deposits in the spleen, liver, heart, salivary glands, and nerves.
Colonic biopsy from another affected individual also contained
B2M-containing amyloid deposits. Amyloid scinotography of 2 patients
showed a heavy visceral amyloid burden in the spleen and adrenal glands,
but not in heart. Valleix et al. (2012) noted that the amyloid
deposition in this family was different from that observed in
dialysis-related amyloidosis, in which B2M-amyloid accumulates around
bones and joints. In addition, serum B2M was not increased in the
patients with familial disease, whereas it is increased in those with
dialysis-related amyloidosis.

;;DAG;;
DYSTROGLYCAN, ALPHA;;
AGRIN RECEPTOR; AGRNR
DYSTROGLYCAN, BETA, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The DAG1 gene encodes 2 dystroglycan proteins, both of which are
dystrophin-associated glycoproteins (DAGs). Dystrophin (DMD; 300377), a
large skeletal muscle protein localized to the inner surface of the
sarcolemma, is tightly linked to a large complex of glycoproteins that
comprise the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). Alpha- and
beta-dystroglycan are parts of the DGC (Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al.,
1992).

Beta-dystroglycan is an integral membrane protein, whereas
alpha-dystroglycan is membrane-associated through its noncovalent
interaction with the extracellular domain of beta-dystroglycan. The
alpha- and beta-dystroglycans provide important physical linkages
between components of basement membranes and cytoplasmic proteins that
bind to the actin cytoskeleton (Spear, 1998).

CLONING

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (1992) demonstrated that the transmembrane
43-kD and extracellular 156-kD DAG proteins are encoded by a single
5.8-kb mRNA. The deduced 895-residue precursor protein has a molecular
mass of 96 kD and undergoes posttranslational processing to generate a
43-kD transmembrane protein and a 156-kD extracellular protein. The
predicted amino acid sequence of human and rabbit dystroglycan are 93%
identical, with predicted glycosylation sites being conserved. Both
dystroglycan proteins were expressed in a variety of fetal and adult
tissues. The muscle and nonmuscle isoforms of dystroglycan differ by
carbohydrate moieties but not protein sequence.

GENE STRUCTURE

The coding sequence of the DAG1 gene is organized into 2 exons,
separated by a large intron (Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al., 1993).

MAPPING

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (1992, 1993) mapped the DAG gene to
chromosome 3 by Southern blot analysis of human/Chinese hamster somatic
cell hybrid DNAs. The regional assignment to 3p21 was confirmed and
further refined by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Gorecki et al. (1994) demonstrated that the Dag1 gene is located on
mouse chromosome 9 in a region of conserved synteny with human 3p. The
location was consistent with a possibility that dystroglycan mutations
are involved in either of 2 mouse neurologic mutations, 'ducky' (du) or
'tippy' (tip).

GENE FUNCTION

Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al. (1992) demonstrated that the extracellular
156-kD DAG binds laminin, and thus may provide linkage between the
sarcolemma and extracellular matrix (ECM).

Agrin (103320) is a component of the synaptic basal lamina which induces
the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors and other elements of the
postsynaptic membrane. Ma et al. (1993) determined the localization,
binding characteristics, and biochemical profile of the agrin receptor
in Torpedo electric organ membranes and defined domains of agrin that
bind this receptor. Campanelli et al. (1994) and Gee et al. (1994)
presented evidence that the alpha-dystrophin-associated glycoprotein
functions as an agrin receptor. Utrophin (128240) colocalizes with
agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor clusters. Agrin may function by
initiating or stabilizing a synapse-specific membrane cytoskeleton that
in turn serves as a scaffold upon which synaptic molecules are
concentrated. Sealock and Froehner (1994) reviewed the evidence that
alpha-dystroglycan is an agrin-binding protein and the functional
implications of this.

Yamada et al. (1996) showed that dystroglycan is a dual receptor for
agrin and laminin-2 in the Schwann cell membrane. Laminin-2 is composed
of the alpha-2 (156225), beta-1 (150240), and gamma-1 (150290) laminin
chains.

Rambukkana et al. (1998) showed that alpha-DG serves as a Schwann cell
receptor for Mycobacterium leprae, the causative organism of leprosy.
They found that M. leprae specifically binds to alpha-DG only in the
presence of the G domain of the alpha-2 chain of laminin-2. Native
alpha-DG competitively inhibited the laminin-2-mediated M. leprae
binding to primary Schwann cells. Thus, M. leprae may use linkage
between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton through laminin-2
and alpha-DG for its interaction with Schwann cells. The neuropathy of
leprosy is caused, in part, by invasion of peripheral nerves by M.
leprae. The Schwann cell is an important target for bacterial invasion.
In the endoneurium of peripheral nerves, Schwann cells are covered by
basal lamina, composed of laminin, type IV collagen, entactin/nidogen,
and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Similarly, Cao et al. (1998) found
that alpha-DG serves as a receptor for lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (LCMV) and for Lassa fever virus (LFV). They purified a peripheral
membrane protein that is interactive with LCMV from cells permissive to
infection by this virus. Tryptic peptides from this protein were
determined to be alpha-DG. Several strains of LCMV and other
arenaviruses, including LFV, Oliveros, and Mobala, bound to purified
alpha-DG protein. Soluble alpha-DG blocked both LCMV and LFV infection.
Cells bearing a null mutation of the gene encoding DG were resistant to
LCMV infection, and reconstitution of DG expression in null mutant cells
restored susceptibility to LCMV infection. Thus, alpha-DG is a cellular
receptor for both LCMV and LFV.

Spence et al. (2004) localized beta-dystroglycan to microvilli
structures in a number of cell types where it associated with the
cytoskeletal adaptor ezrin (VIL2; 123900), through which it was able to
modulate the actin cytoskeleton and induced peripheral filopodia and
microvilli. Ezrin was able to interact with dystroglycan through a
cluster of basic residues in the juxtamembrane region of dystroglycan,
and mutation of these residues both prevented ezrin binding and the
induction of actin-rich surface protrusions.

Wright et al. (2012) found that mouse dystroglycan bound directly to the
laminin G domain of the axonal guidance molecule Slit (see SLIT1,
603742) in a calcium-dependent manner. Binding to dystroglycan was
required for proper Slit localization within the basement membrane and
floor plate, and for development of normal commissural axon guidance
tracts. Mutations in mouse Ispd (614631) or B3gnt1 (605517) that
disrupted dystroglycan glycosylation resulted in similar abnormalities
in axonal pathfinding.

- Role in Muscular Dystrophy

Abnormal glycosylation of DAG1 results in several forms of congenital
muscular dystrophy that range phenotypically from severe forms with
brain and eye anomalies (see, e.g., MDDGA1; 236670) to milder
limb-girdle types (see, e.g., MDDGC1; 609308). Mutations in 6 different
genes involved in glycosylation of DAG1 have been identified; these
genes include POMT1 (607423), POMT2 (607439), POMGNT1 (606822), FKTN
(607440), FKRP (606596), and LARGE (603590). These disorders are
collectively known as 'dystroglycanopathies' (Godfrey et al., 2007).

Matsumura et al. (1993) demonstrated deficient expression of multiple
dystrophin-associated glycoproteins in a form of congenital muscular
dystrophy due to mutation in the FKTN gene (607440). This form of
congenital muscular dystrophy, also known as Fukuyama-type congenital
muscular dystrophy (FCMD) or muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with
brain and eye anomalies (type A4; MDDGA4; 253800) is characterized by
defective glycosylation of DAG1. Matsumura et al. (1993) noted that the
156DAG/43DAG proteins are expressed in both muscle and brain.

Arahata et al. (1993) found preservation of immunostaining for 43DAG in
FCMD at the plasma membrane of the muscle fibers. On the other hand,
they found reduced laminin M (or merosin (156225), a striated
muscle-specific basal-lamina-associated protein) in most muscle fibers
of FCMD, suggesting that it may have an early or primary role in the
pathogenesis of the disorder.

Matsumura et al. (1993) showed that truncation of the dystrophin
molecule with loss of the C-terminal domains can lead to severe muscular
dystrophy, even when truncated dystrophin is demonstrable in the
subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. This is because the C-terminal domains are
involved in the interaction with the large oligomeric complex of
sarcolemmal glycoproteins, including dystroglycan.

Tinsley et al. (1994) reviewed the 'increasing complexity of the
dystrophin-associated protein complex.' Although the exact function of
dystrophin remained to be determined, analysis of its interaction with
this large oligomeric protein complex at the sarcolemma and the
identification of a structurally related protein, utrophin (128240),
were leading to the identification of candidate genes for various
neuromuscular disorders.

As reviewed by Spear (1998), structural integrity of the sarcolemma in
skeletal and cardiac muscle appears to depend in part on binding of the
cytoplasmic protein dystrophin to both actin and the cytoplasmic tail of
beta-dystroglycan, and binding of alpha-dystroglycan to laminin-2 in the
basal lamina. Laminins are composed of 3 polypeptide chains designated
alpha, beta, and gamma. The multiple isoforms of laminin differ in their
constituent chains. Laminin-2 is composed of alpha-2, beta-1, and
gamma-1. Homozygous deletion of the gene encoding dystroglycan is lethal
at the embryonic stage in mice (Williamson et al., 1997) and would
presumably also be lethal in humans.

Yamada et al. (2001) demonstrated that a 30-kD fragment of
beta-dystroglycan is the product of proteolytic processing of the
extracellular domain of beta-dystroglycan by the membrane-associated
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2; 120360). This processing disintegrates
the dystroglycan complex and disrupts this particular link between the
ECM and cell membrane. The authors proposed that this processing of
beta-dystroglycan may play a crucial role in the molecular pathogenesis
of sarcoglycanopathy.

Using PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting to analyze samples
from patients with Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, Hayashi et
al. (2001) confirmed a deficiency of fukutin (FKTN; 607440) and found
marked deficiency of highly glycosylated DAG1 in skeletal and cardiac
muscle and reduced amounts of DAG1 in brain tissue. Beta-dystroglycan
was normal in all tissues examined. These findings supported the
suggestion that fukutin deficiency affects the modification of
glycosylation of DAG1, which then cannot localize or function properly
and may be degraded or eluted from the extracellular surface membrane of
the muscle fiber. Hayashi et al. (2001) concluded that this disruption
underlies the developmental, structural, and functional damage to
muscles in patients with FCMD.

Using transfection experiments, Esapa et al. (2002) determined that
fukutin and fukutin-related protein (FKRP; 606596) are targeted to the
medial Golgi apparatus through their N termini and transmembrane
domains. Overexpression of FKRP in CHO cells altered the
posttranslational processing of alpha- and beta-dystroglycan, thus
inhibiting maturation of the 2 isoforms. Mutations in the DxD motif or
in the Golgi-targeting sequence, which cause inefficient trafficking of
FKRP to the Golgi apparatus, did not alter dystroglycan processing in
vitro. The pro448-to-leu mutation in FKRP (P448L; 606596.0003) resulted
in mislocalization of the mutant protein and disruption in dystroglycan
processing. Esapa et al. (2002) concluded that FKRP is required for the
posttranslational modification of dystroglycan. They suggested that
aberrant processing of dystroglycan caused by a mislocalized FKRP mutant
could be a novel mechanism that causes congenital muscular dystrophy.

Kanagawa et al. (2004) showed that both the N-terminal domain and a
portion of the mucin-like domain of alpha-dystroglycan are essential for
high-affinity laminin receptor function. They found that
posttranslational modification of alpha-dystroglycan by LARGE (603590)
occurs within the mucin-like domain, but the N-terminal domain interacts
with LARGE, defining an intracellular enzyme-substrate recognition motif
necessary to initiate functional glycosylation. Gene replacement in
dystroglycan-deficient muscle demonstrated that the dystroglycan
C-terminal domain is sufficient only for dystrophin-glycoprotein complex
assembly. To prevent muscle degeneration, expression of a functional
dystroglycan through LARGE recognition and glycosylation was required.
The authors concluded that molecular recognition of dystroglycan by
LARGE is a key determinant in the biosynthetic pathway to produce mature
and functional dystroglycan.

Using mass spectrometry- and nuclear magnetic resonance-based structural
analyses, Yoshida-Moriguchi et al. (2010) identified a phosphorylated
O-mannosyl glycan on the mucin-like domain of recombinant alpha-DG,
which was required for laminin binding. Yoshida-Moriguchi et al. (2010)
demonstrated that patients with muscle-eye-brain disease (253280) and
Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (253800), as well as mice with
myodystrophy, commonly have defects in a postphosphoryl modification of
this phosphorylated O-linked mannose, and that this modification is
mediated by the LARGE protein. Yoshida-Moriguchi et al. (2010) concluded
that their findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms that
underlie congenital muscular dystrophy.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a Turkish woman with limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy type C (MDDGC9; 613818) and severe
cognitive impairment reported by Dincer et al. (2003), Hara et al.
(2011) identified a homozygous mutation in the DAG1 gene (T192M;
128239.0001). Functional expression analysis in vitro and in mice
indicated that the mutation decreased LARGE (603590)-mediated
posttranslational O-mannosyl glycosylation of DAG1, interfering with its
receptor function and laminin binding in skeletal muscle and brain.

ANIMAL MODEL

Williamson et al. (1997) found that heterozygous Dag1-null mice were
viable and fertile. In contrast, homozygous embryos exhibited gross
developmental abnormalities beginning around 6.5 days' gestation. They
found that an early defect in the development of homozygous embryos was
a disruption of the Reichert membrane, an extra-embryonic basement
membrane. Consistent with the functional defects observed in Reichert
membrane, dystroglycan protein was localized in apposition to this
structure in normal egg cylinder-stage embryos. They also showed that
the localization of 2 critical structural elements of Reichert membrane,
laminin and collagen IV, were specifically disrupted in the homozygous
Dag1 embryos. The data indicated that dystroglycan is required for the
development of Reichert membrane and that disruption of basement
membrane organization is a common feature of muscular dystrophies linked
to the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.

Henry and Campbell (1998) found that Dag1-null murine embryonic stem
cells had defective formation of basement membranes in embryoid bodies.
These results further indicated that dystroglycan-laminin interactions
are prerequisite for the deposition of other basement membrane proteins.
Dystroglycan may exert its influence on basement membrane assembly by
binding soluble laminin and organizing it on the cell surface.

Cote et al. (1999) reported that chimeric mice generated with ES cells
targeted for both dystroglycan alleles have skeletal muscles essentially
devoid of dystroglycans and develop a progressive muscle pathology with
changes emblematic of muscular dystrophies in humans. In addition, many
neuromuscular junctions are disrupted in these mice. The ultrastructure
of basement membranes and the deposition of laminin within them,
however, appears unaffected in dystroglycan-deficient muscles. Cote et
al. (1999) concluded that dystroglycans are necessary for myofiber
survival and synapse differentiation or stability, but not for the
formation of the muscle basement membrane, and that dystroglycans may
have more than a purely structural function in maintaining muscle
integrity.

Moore et al. (2002) showed that brain-selective deletion of dystroglycan
in mice is sufficient to cause congenital muscular dystrophy-like brain
malformations, including disarray of cerebral cortical layering, fusion
of cerebral hemispheres and cerebellar folia, and aberrant migration of
granule cells. Dystroglycan-null brain loses its high affinity binding
to the extracellular matrix protein laminin (see 150240) and shows
discontinuities in the pial surface basal lamina (glia limitans) that
probably underlie the neuronal migration errors. Furthermore, mutant
mice have severely blunted hippocampal long-term potentiation with
electrophysiologic characterization indicating that dystroglycan might
have a postsynaptic role in learning and memory. Moore et al. (2002)
concluded that these data strongly supported the hypothesis that defects
in dystroglycan are central to the pathogenesis of structural and
functional brain abnormalities seen in congenital muscular dystrophies.

Michele et al. (2002) demonstrated in both muscle-eye-brain disease
(253280) and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (253800) patients
that alpha-dystroglycan is expressed at the muscle membrane, but similar
hypoglycosylation in the diseases directly abolishes binding activity of
dystroglycan for the ligands laminin, neurexin (see 600565), and agrin
(103320). Michele et al. (2002) showed that this posttranslational
biochemical and functional disruption of alpha-dystroglycan is
recapitulated in the muscle and central nervous system of mutant
myodystrophy (myd) mice, who have a mutation in the LARGE gene. Michele
et al. (2002) demonstrated that myd mice have abnormal neuronal
migration in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, and show
disruption of the basal lamina. In addition, myd mice reveal that
dystroglycan targets proteins to functional sites in brain through its
interactions with extracellular matrix proteins. Michele et al. (2002)
suggested that at least 3 mammalian genes function within a convergent
posttranslational processing pathway during the biosynthesis of
dystroglycan and that abnormal dystroglycan-ligand interactions underlie
the pathogenic mechanism of muscular dystrophy with brain abnormalities.

Cohn et al. (2002) found that striated muscle-specific disruption of the
Dag1 gene in mice resulted in loss of the dystrophin-glycoprotein
complex in differentiated muscle and a remarkably mild muscular
dystrophy with hypertrophy and without tissue fibrosis. They found that
satellite cells, expressing dystroglycan, supported continued efficient
regeneration of skeletal muscle along with transient expression of
dystroglycan in regenerating muscle fibers. Cohn et al. (2002)
demonstrated a similar phenomenon of reexpression of functional
dystroglycan in regenerating muscle fibers in a mild form of human
muscular dystrophy caused by disruption of posttranslational
dystroglycan processing. They concluded that maintenance of regenerative
capacity by satellite cells expressing dystroglycan is likely
responsible for mild disease progression in mice and possibly humans.
Cohn et al. (2002) suggested that inadequate repair of skeletal muscle
by satellite cells represents an important mechanism affecting the
pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.

Hara et al. (2011) demonstrated that mice with a homozygous T190M
mutation in the Dag1 gene, which corresponds to the human T192M mutation
(128239.0001), developed muscular dystrophy and neurologic motor
impairment. The mutation decreased LARGE (603590)-mediated
posttranslational O-mannosyl glycosylation of Dag1, interfering with its
receptor function and laminin binding in skeletal muscle and brain.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY-DYSTROGLYCANOPATHY (LIMB-GIRDLE), TYPE C, 9 (1
family)
DAG1, THR192MET

In a Turkish woman with limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (MDDGC9; 613818) and cognitive impairment,
Hara et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 575C-T transition in the DAG1
gene, resulting in a thr192-to-met (T192M) substitution in a highly
conserved residue in the N terminus of the protein. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 200
control chromosomes. Functional expression analysis in vitro and in mice
indicated that the mutation decreased LARGE (603590)-mediated
posttranslational O-mannosyl glycosylation of DAG1, interfering with its
receptor function and laminin binding in skeletal muscle and brain.

600681	TITLE *600681 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, INWARDLY RECTIFYING, SUBFAMILY J, MEMBER 2; KCNJ2
;;HHIRK1;;
IRK1;;
KIR2.1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Raab-Graham et al. (1994) used low stringency colony hybridization with
the complete coding region of the mouse IRK gene (Kubo et al., 1993) to
isolate cDNA from human heart that encodes an inwardly rectifying
potassium channel, KCNJ2. Raab-Graham et al. (1994) symbolized the gene
HHIRK1. The cDNA encodes a 427-amino acid protein with 2 putative
transmembrane domains and an H5 region. Expression of HHIRK1 in Xenopus
oocytes demonstrated strong inward rectification that was blocked by
both extracellular barium and cesium ions, and they measured a single
channel conductance of 30 pS. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a
single 5.5-kb transcript with high levels in heart, brain, placenta,
lung, and skeletal muscle. Lower levels were present in kidney. The
HHIRK1 message was found in all brain subregions tested, particularly in
the caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, and substantia nigra. In regions
of sequence overlap, HHIRK1 shares 66 to 67% identity with a small
conductance human potassium channel (KCNJ4; 600504). Because of
similarities in channel properties, Raab-Graham et al. (1994) suggested
that HHIRK1 was the prominent cardiac inward rectifier.

GENE STRUCTURE

Derst et al. (2001) determined that the KCNJ2 gene contains 2 exons and
spans approximately 10 kb.

MAPPING

Raab-Graham et al. (1994) mapped the HHIRK1 gene to human chromosome 17
by PCR amplification from a somatic cell hybrid panel. This location is
consistent with the mapping of mouse IRK1 to a distal region of mouse
chromosome 11 that shares homology with human chromosome 17. (See also
KCNJ1, 600359).

By radiation hybrid analysis, electronic PCR, and sequence similarity to
mapped BACs, Derst et al. (2001) mapped the KCNJ2 gene to chromosome
17q23.1-q24.2, separated by 34 kb from KCNJ16 (605722).

GENE FUNCTION

Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels are important regulators of
resting membrane potential and cell excitability. The activity of Kir
channels is critically dependent on the integrity of channel
interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Using
targeted mutations in KCNJ2 and KCNJ1 (600359), which the authors called
Kir2.1 and Kir1.1, Lopes et al. (2002) identified residues important for
PIP2 interaction. Mutations in residues associated with Andersen
syndrome (170390) and Bartter syndrome (241200) decreased the strength
of channel-PIP2 interactions. Lopes et al. (2002) concluded that a
decrease in channel-PIP2 interactions underlies the molecular mechanism
of Andersen and Bartter syndromes when these mutations are present in
patients.

To gain insight into the mechanism of arrhythmia susceptibility,
Tristani-Firouzi et al. (2002) used a ventricular myocyte model to
simulate the effects of reduced Kir2.1. A reduction in Kir2.1 prolonged
the terminal phase of the cardiac action potential, and in the setting
of reduced extracellular potassium ion, induced delayed
afterdepolarizations and spontaneous arrhythmias. These findings
suggested that the substrate for arrhythmia susceptibility in Andersen
syndrome is distinct from that in the other forms of inherited long QT
syndrome.

Although chloroquine is an important therapeutic agent for treatment of
malaria, its safety margin is narrow. Chloroquine inhibits the cardiac
inward rectifier K+ current and can induce lethal ventricular
arrhythmias. Rodriguez-Menchaca et al. (2008) found that chloroquine
blocked mouse Kir2.1 channels from the cytoplasmic surface in a voltage-
and K(+)-dependent manner. Mutagenesis and molecular modeling showed
that chloroquine did not penetrate deeply into the channel and was
stabilized within the binding pocket by negatively charged and aromatic
amino acids.

Epshtein et al. (2009) noted that K(+) channel activation is suppressed
by elevated membrane cholesterol. By mutating specific residues in mouse
Kir2.1, they found that cholesterol sensitivity was due to a subset of
channel-activating PIP2-sensitive residues within the CD loop in the
C-terminal cytosolic domain. PIP2-sensitive residues outside this loop
and lipid-facing residues of the outer helix transmembrane domain were
not involved in cholesterol sensitivity. Mutations of the critical
residues did not interfere with Kir2.1-PIP2 interaction and did not
alter the targeting of Kir2.1 to specific membrane domains. Epshtein et
al. (2009) hypothesized that these residues may contribute to the
docking of the Kir2.1 C terminus to the inner membrane leaflet,
facilitating its interaction with membrane cholesterol, and possibly
stabilizing the channel in the closed conformation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

-  Andersen Cardiodysrhythmic Periodic Paralysis

Andersen syndrome is characterized by periodic paralysis, cardiac
arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features. Using 400 polymorphic markers
across the entire genome in 15 individuals of a kindred with Andersen
syndrome, Plaster et al. (2001) mapped the disease locus to 17q23
(maximum lod of 3.23 at theta of 0 for D17S949) near the KCNJ2 gene.
They identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the KCNJ2 gene
in the linked family and 8 additional heterozygous mutations in
unrelated patients. Expression of 2 of these mutations (D71V,
600681.0001, and R218W, 600681.0002) in Xenopus oocytes revealed loss of
function and a dominant-negative effect in KCNJ2 current as assayed by
voltage-clamp. Plaster et al. (2001) concluded that mutations in the
KCNJ2 gene cause Andersen syndrome, and the findings suggested that
KCNJ2 plays an important role in developmental signaling in addition to
its function in controlling cell excitability in skeletal muscle and
heart.

Tristani-Firouzi et al. (2002) identified 3 novel Andersen
syndrome-associated mutations in the KCNJ2 gene
(600681.0007-600681.0009) and presented extensive clinical and in vitro
electrophysiologic studies on a total of 17 kindreds with 10 different
mutations. All these mutations in KCNJ2 caused dominant-negative
suppression of Kir2.1 channel function. There was significant overlap in
the extent of dominant-negative effect as well as overlap in clinical
phenotype. LQT and ventricular arrhythmias were common in mutation
carriers. Unlike other forms of inherited LQTS, sudden death had not
been reported in Andersen syndrome.

Among 17 unrelated probands with clinical symptoms of Andersen syndrome,
Donaldson et al. (2003) identified 8 different mutations, including 6
novel mutations, in the KCNJ2 gene in 9 probands. Six probands possessed
mutations of residues implicated in binding membrane-associated PIP2.
Including previous reports, the authors determined that mutations in
PIP2-related residues accounted for disease in 18 of 29 (62%) reported
families with KCNJ2-related ATS. Donaldson et al. (2003) found no
phenotypic differences between patients with mutations in the
PIP2-related residues and those with mutations elsewhere in the gene.
The authors suggested that genetic heterogeneity likely exists for this
disorder.

Davies et al. (2005) identified 9 different pathogenic mutations in the
KCNJ2 gene, including 6 novel mutations, in 22 affected individuals from
11 unrelated families with Andersen-Tawil syndrome. In vitro functional
expression studies of 5 of the mutant proteins showed a
dominant-negative effect on the wildtype allele.

In 3 affected members of a family with Andersen syndrome, Lu et al.
(2006) identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the KCNJ2
gene (T75R; 600681.0011), located in the highly conserved cytoplasmic
N-terminal domain. In vitro studies revealed that the mutant channel was
nonfunctional, and T75R transgenic mice had bidirectional ventricular
tachycardia after induction and longer QT intervals.

Choi et al. (2007) identified 2 different heterozygous missense
mutations in the KCNJ2 gene in affected members of 2 Korean families
with Andersen-Tawil syndrome. The authors stated that this was the first
report of causative mutations in KCNJ2 in Korean ATS patients.

In 2 unrelated probands with periodic paralysis and cardiac
dysrhythmias, who were known to be negative for common CACNA1S and SCN4A
mutations causing hypokalemic periodic paralysis, Bendahhou et al.
(2007) identified heterozygosity for 2 different missense mutations in
the KCNJ2 gene (600681.0012 and 600681.0013, respectively). Bendahhou et
al. (2007) noted that except for a small chin in 1 proband, there were
no dysmorphic features in these families, and suggested that KCNJ2
should be screened in patients with periodic paralysis even when the
classic dysmorphic features of Andersen syndrome are not present.

- Short QT Syndrome 3

In a 5-year-old girl and her father with short QT syndrome-3 (SQT3;
609622), Priori et al. (2005) identified a missense mutation in the
KCNJ2 gene (600681.0010). Functional studies revealed a significant
increase in the outward component of the I-V relation of I(K1).

- Familial Atrial Fibrillation 9

In affected members of a Chinese family segregating autosomal dominant
atrial fibrillation (ATFB9; 613980), Xia et al. (2005) identified
heterozygosity for a mutation in the KCNJ2 gene (V93I; 600681.0014).
Functional analysis revealed that the V93I mutation has a
gain-of-function effect on the Kir2.1 current, in contrast to the loss
of function observed with previously reported KCNJ2 mutations associated
with the Andersen periodic paralysis syndrome.

- Associations Pending Confirmation

KCNJ2 gene and susceptibility to thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, see
TTPP3 (614834).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Doyle et al. (1998) determined the atomic structure of a bacterial
potassium channel pore by means of x-ray crystallography. However,
serious doubts were raised concerning whether the prokaryotic potassium
channel pore actually represents those of eukaryotes. Lu et al. (2001)
addressed this issue by substituting the prokaryotic potassium channel
pore into eukaryotic voltage-gated (see 176260) and inward-rectifier
potassium channels. The resulting chimeras retained the respective
functional hallmarks of the eukaryotic channels, which indicates that
the ion conduction pore is indeed conserved among potassium channels.

Preisig-Muller et al. (2002) demonstrated that heteromerization of
Kir2.1 channels with wildtype Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 channels contributes to
the phenotype of Andersen syndrome. Coexpression of Kir2.1 mutants
related to Andersen syndrome with wildtype Kir2.x channels showed a
dominant negative effect, the extent of which varied between different
mutants. The results suggested that differential tetramerization of the
mutant allele of Kir2.1 with wildtype Kir2.1, Kir2.2, and Kir2.3
channels represents the molecular basis of the extraordinary pleiotropy
and variability of Andersen syndrome. In addition to cardiac arrhythmias
and periodic paralysis, dysmorphic features include scoliosis, low-set
ears, wide-set eyes, small chin, and broad forehead, but expression of
these traits is highly variable.

Miake et al. (2002) replaced 3 amino acid residues in the pore structure
of Kir2.1 with alanine to create a dominant-negative construct that
suppresses current when expressed with wildtype Kir2.1. When this
construct was packaged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) into a
bicistronic adenoviral vector and injected into the left ventricular
cavity of guinea pigs during transient cross-clamping of the great
vessels, transduction was successful in about 20% of ventricular
myocytes, as determined by GFP fluorescence. This suppression of Kir2.1
converted quiescent heart muscle cells into pacemaker cells that
successfully generated a spontaneous rhythmic electrical activity in the
ventricle in vivo. Miake et al. (2002) concluded that genetically
engineered pacemakers could be developed as a possible alternative to
implantable electronic devices.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, ASP71VAL

In the affected individuals of a pedigree (K4415) with Andersen syndrome
(LQT7; 170390), Plaster et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous
(dominant) mutation in the KCNJ2 gene. The A-to-T transversion at
nucleotide 440 resulted in an asp71-to-val substitution in the N
terminus of the KCNJ2 protein. The mutation was not found in 100
unaffected and unrelated individuals. Expression of this mutation in
Xenopus oocytes revealed loss of function and a dominant-negative effect
in KCNJ2 current as assayed by voltage-clamp.

.0002
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, ARG218TRP

In the affected individuals of 4 different pedigrees (K2679, K6515,
K2681, and K2401) with Andersen syndrome (LQT7; 170390), Plaster et al.
(2001) identified a heterozygous (dominant) mutation in the KCNJ2 gene.
The C-to-T transition at nucleotide 880 resulted in an arg218-to-trp
(R218W) substitution within the C-terminal interaction domain of the
KCNJ2 protein. The mutation occurred de novo in 3 pedigrees, and it was
not found in 100 unaffected and unrelated individuals. Expression of
this mutation in Xenopus oocytes revealed loss of function and a
dominant-negative effect in KCNJ2 current as assayed by voltage-clamp.

.0003
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, GLY300VAL

In the affected individuals of 2 different pedigrees (K3677 and K3387)
with Andersen syndrome (LQT7; 170390), Plaster et al. (2001) identified
a heterozygous (dominant) mutation in the KCNJ2 gene. The G-to-T
transversion at nucleotide 1127 resulted in a gly300-to-val
substitution. This mutation was not found in 100 unaffected and
unrelated individuals.

.0004
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, 12-BP DEL, NT513

In an affected individual of a pedigree (K2281) with Andersen syndrome
(LQT7; 170390), Plaster et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous
(dominant) in-frame deletion of 12 nucleotides in the KCNJ2 gene,
resulting in the deletion of amino acids 95 to 98 in the M1
transmembrane segment. This mutation was not found in 100 unaffected and
unrelated individuals.

.0005
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, 6-BP DEL, NT1167

In an affected individual of a pedigree (K5768) with Andersen syndrome
(LQT7; 170390), Plaster et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous
(dominant) in-frame deletion of 6 nucleotides in the KCNJ2 gene,
resulting in the deletion of amino acids 314 to 315. This mutation
occurred de novo in this family and was not found in 100 unaffected and
unrelated individuals.

.0006
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, ARG67TRP

See Andersen cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis (LQT7; 170390).
Andelfinger et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous missense mutation
(arg67 to trp; R67W) in the KCNJ2 gene in 41 members of a kindred with
ventricular arrhythmias (13 of 16 female members, 81%) and periodic
paralysis (10 of 25 male members, 40%) segregating as autosomal dominant
traits with sex-specific variable expressivity. Some mutation carriers
exhibited dysmorphic features, including hypertelorism, small mandible,
syndactyly, clinodactyly, cleft palate, and scoliosis, which, together
with cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis, constitute Andersen syndrome
(170390). However, no individual exhibited all manifestations of
Andersen syndrome, and this diagnosis was not considered in the proband
until other family members were examined. Other features seen in this
kindred included unilateral dysplastic kidney and cardiovascular
malformation (i.e., bicuspid aortic valve, bicuspid aortic valve with
coarctation of the aorta, or valvular pulmonary stenosis), which had not
previously been associated with Andersen syndrome. Nonspecific
electrocardiographic abnormalities were identified in some individuals,
but none had a prolonged QT interval.

Andelfinger et al. (2002) stated that sex specificity of cardiac
arrhythmias and periodic paralysis had not previously been described in
Andersen syndrome. However, there had been an increasing recognition of
specific electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic differences--for
example, resting heart rate and corrected QT intervals--between males
and females, but the precise way in which sex and gonadal steroids
contribute to these differences was not known (Pham and Rosen, 2002;
Wolbrette et al., 2002). Female subjects with the R67W mutation
typically noted onset of ventricular arrhythmia after age 10 years. An
increased incidence is usually reported during pregnancy, but female
subjects with R67W reported reduced ventricular arrhythmias during
pregnancy and after age 55 years, coinciding with menopause.

.0007
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, PRO186LEU

In a kindred with Andersen syndrome (LQT7; 170390), Tristani-Firouzi et
al. (2002) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 785 of the KCNJ2
gene, which resulted in a pro186-to-leu (P186L) amino acid substitution.
This mutation alters an amino acid of a PKKR motif (amino acids
186-189), a C-terminal motif implicated in binding the signaling
phospholipid PIP2.

.0008
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, VAL302MET

In a kindred with Andersen syndrome (LQT7; 170390), Tristani-Firouzi et
al. (2002) found a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1132 of the KCNJ2
gene, resulting in a val302-to-met (V302M) amino acid change. This
mutation lies in a C-terminal region that may be responsible for channel
subunit assembly.

.0009
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, ASN216HIS

In a kindred with Andersen syndrome (LQT7; 170390), Tristani-Firouzi et
al. (2002) identified an A-to-C transversion at nucleotide 874 of the
KCNJ2 gene, which resulted in an asn261-to-his (N216H) amino acid
change. This mutation lies within a C-terminal region (amino acids
207-246) thought to be involved in PIP2 interactions.

.0010
SHORT QT SYNDROME 3
KCNJ2, ASP172ASN

In a 5-year-old girl and her father with short QT syndrome-3 (SQT3;
609622), Priori et al. (2005) identified a 514G-A transition in the
KCNJ2 gene, resulting in an asp172-to-asn (D172N) substitution. The
mutation was not found in unaffected family members. Functional studies
revealed a significant increase in the outward component of the I-V
relation of I(K1).

.0011
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, THR75ARG

In 3 affected members of a family with Andersen syndrome (LQT7; 170390),
Lu et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for a 224C-G transversion,
resulting in a thr75-to-arg (T75R) substitution at a highly conserved
codon in the cytoplasmic N-terminal portion of Kir2.1. The mutation was
not found in 2 unaffected family members or in 100 unrelated controls.
Although the mutant protein was able to coassemble and traffic to the
cell membrane in mouse atrial cardiomyocytes, voltage clamp analysis in
Xenopus oocytes revealed that the mutant channel was nonfunctional; upon
coexpression of mutant and wildtype cRNA in Xenopus oocytes, the K(+)
current was completely lost, demonstrating the strong dominant-negative
effect of the T75R mutant. Transgenic T75R mice had bidirectional
ventricular tachycardia after induction and longer QT intervals.

.0012
ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, CYS54PHE

In a 19-year-old man with periodic paralysis and cardiac dysrhythmias
(170390), triggered by use of corticosteroids on at least 2 occasions,
Bendahhou et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 489G-T
transversion in the KCNJ2 gene, resulting in a cys54-to-phe (C54F)
substitution at a conserved residue in the N terminus. Functional
expression in mammalian cells revealed loss of function when the mutant
was expressed alone and a dominant-negative effect when expressed with
wildtype channels; however, channel trafficking and assembly were not
affected. The proband's unaffected brother and father also carried the
mutation. Aside from a small chin in the proband, there were no
dysmorphic features in this family.

ANDERSEN CARDIODYSRHYTHMIC PERIODIC PARALYSIS
KCNJ2, THR305PRO

In a 23-year-old woman with periodic paralysis and cardiac dysrhythmias
that began in childhood (170390), Bendahhou et al. (2007) identified
heterozygosity for a 1141A-C transversion in the KCNJ2 gene, resulting
in a thr305-to-pro (T305P) substitution at a conserved residue in the C
terminus. Functional expression in mammalian cells revealed loss of
function when the mutant was expressed alone and a dominant-negative
effect when expressed with wildtype channels; however, channel
trafficking and assembly were not affected. There were no dysmorphic
features in the proband. Her mother, maternal aunt, and maternal
grandmother had a history of cardiac dysrhythmias, and the grandmother
had a pacemaker.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, FAMILIAL, 9
KCNJ2, VAL93ILE

In affected members of a Chinese family with atrial fibrillation (ATFB9;
613980), Xia et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for a 227G-A
transition in the KCNJ2 gene, resulting in a val93-to-ile (V93I)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. The mutation was not found
in 420 controls. Patch-clamp studies in COS-7 and HEK293 cells
demonstrated that the V93I mutation has a gain-of-function effect on
Kir2.1 channels.

613785	TITLE *613785 COMPLEMENT COMPONENT 1, r SUBCOMPONENT; C1R
;;COMPLEMENT COMPONENT C1r
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The complement system is a major mediator of innate immunity. The first
enzymatic event in the cascade of the classical pathway of complement is
the activation of its first component, C1. C1 is a multimolecular
complex consisting of 2 loosely interacting entities: C1q (see 120550),
the recognition subunit, and C1r(2)/C1s(2), the catalytic one.
C1r(2)/C1s(2) is a tetrameric Ca(2+)-dependent complex of C1r and C1s
(120580), 2 serine-proteinase zymogens. C1r acts by transforming the
activation signal (the fixation of C1q on activating reagents, e.g.,
immune complexes) into an enzymic activity (summary by Journet and Tosi,
1986).

CLONING

Leytus et al. (1986) reported the nucleotide sequence for cDNA coding
for C1r. Journet and Tosi (1986) cloned and sequenced a full-length cDNA
for the C1r precursor, which contains a 17-amino acid leader peptide,
followed by a mature 688-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

By means of a cDNA in somatic cell hybrids, Cohen-Haguenauer et al.
(1986) assigned the C1R and C1S genes to chromosome 12. Leppert et al.
(1987) found a maximum lod score of 5.99 at theta = 0.038 for linkage
between C1S and one of the PRP loci (see 168710); the maximum lod score
between C1R and another PRP locus was 4.21 at theta = 0.001. Although
C1r and C1s are structurally and functionally similar, with a
significant degree of sequence homology suggesting origin by gene
duplication, cDNA probes for human C1r and C1s do not cross-hybridize
even at mild stringency conditions and are therefore gene-specific.
Using a panel of human-rodent cell hybrids, Van Cong et al. (1988)
independently assigned the C1r and C1s genes to chromosome 12. In situ
hybridization confirmed these assignments and localized the genes to
12p13.

In a study of 5 families heterozygous at both the C1R and the C1S locus,
Lyons et al. (1989) found evidence consistent with, but not proving,
linkage of the loci; maximum lod score = 1.505 at theta = 0.00.

By hybridization of C1r and C1s probes to restriction endonuclease
fragments of genomic DNA, Tosi et al. (1987) demonstrated close physical
linkage of the genes. This finding was consistent with their evolution
through tandem gene duplication and was also consistent with the
previously observed combined hereditary deficiencies of C1r and C1s (see
216950). Their coordinate expression may depend on the close linkage.
The 2 genes lie in a DNA stretch not longer than 50 kb.

By DNA blotting and sequencing analyses of genomic DNA and of an
isolated genomic DNA clone, Kusumoto et al. (1988) showed that the C1r
and C1s genes are closely located in a 'tail-to-tail' arrangement at a
distance of about 9.5 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kamboh and Ferrell (1986) demonstrated genetic polymorphism of C1R using
the high-resolving power of isoelectric focusing in 6M urea followed by
immunoblotting. Kamboh et al. (1988) described a new allele by
isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting. Using the same methods, Kamboh
et al. (1989) described 5 new alleles.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

607825	TITLE *607825 HOOK, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; HOOK3
;;HK3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Hook proteins are cytosolic coiled-coil proteins that contain conserved
N-terminal domains, which attach to microtubules, and more divergent
C-terminal domains, which mediate binding to organelles. The Drosophila
Hook protein is a component of the endocytic compartment (summary by
Walenta et al., 2001).

CLONING

Using homology with HOOK1 (607820) and HOOK2 (607824), Walenta et al.
(2001) identified an EST containing HOOK3, and they obtained the
full-length cDNA by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of a placenta cDNA library.
The deduced 718-amino acid protein has an acidic N-terminal globular
domain, an extended central coiled-coil motif, and a basic C-terminal
globular domain. HOOK3 shares significant identity with HOOK1, HOOK2,
and the Drosophila Hook protein, with highest conservation in the
N-terminal domain. Western blot analysis detected HOOK3 in all mouse
tissues and human and monkey cell lines examined. Endogenous HOOK3
detected in HEK293 cells had an apparent molecular mass of about 83 kD.
Immunolocalization of endogenous HOOK3 in Hep2 cells revealed a
perinuclear distribution and colocalization with Golgi marker proteins.
Immunogold labeling revealed a polarized distribution of HOOK3 in the
Golgi complex, consistent with labeling of the cis face of the Golgi.

GENE FUNCTION

By Western blot analysis of HEK293 immunoprecipitates, Walenta et al.
(2001) determined that HOOK3 exists in a protein complex that is
distinct from complexes containing HOOK1 and HOOK2. By microtubule
spin-down assay, they determined that full-length HOOK3 and a C-terminal
truncation mutant bound to microtubules. An N-terminal domain of 164
amino acids was sufficient to bind directly to microtubules.
Overexpression of full-length HOOK3 in monkey kidney cells caused a
scattered Golgi morphology and disrupted the microtubule network. During
mitosis, HOOK3 localized to the microtubule asters in prophase. When the
mitotic spindle was evident in metaphase, HOOK3 showed a more diffuse
cytoplasmic distribution.

613764	TITLE *613764 SECRETORY CARRIER MEMBRANE PROTEIN 4; SCAMP4
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Secretory carrier membrane proteins (SCAMPs) are widely distributed
integral membrane proteins implicated in membrane trafficking. Most
SCAMPs (e.g., SCAMP1; 606911) have N-terminal cytoplasmic NPF
(arg-pro-phe) repeats, 4 central transmembrane regions, and a short
C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. These SCAMPs likely have a role in
endocytosis that is mediated by their NPF repeats. Other SCAMPs, such as
SCAMP4, lack the NPF repeats and are therefore unlikely to function in
endocytosis (summary by Fernandez-Chacon and Sudhof, 2000).

CLONING

By searching EST databases, Fernandez-Chacon and Sudhof (2000)
identified mouse Scamp4. The deduced 230-amino acid mouse protein
contains 4 transmembrane domains that are highly conserved among other
SCAMPs, with little conservation at the N- and C-terminal ends. Scamp4
lacks the N-terminal NPF repeats found in several other SCAMPs. Northern
blot analysis revealed variable expression of Scamp4 in all rat tissues
examined, with highest expression in testis and liver.

Krebs and Pfaff (2001) cloned rat Scamp4. The deduced protein lacks the
calcium-binding, leucine zipper, and NPF motifs found in other SCAMPs,
but it has a putative protein kinase C (PKC; see 176960) phosphorylation
site. In situ hybridization showed that Scamp4 mRNA was relatively low
in female rat forebrain, with highest levels in ventromedial
hypothalamus, habenula, and hippocampus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using differential display PCR, Krebs and Pfaff (2001) found reduced
expression of Scamp4 mRNA in the ventromedial hypothalamus of female rat
brains after progesterone treatment, following estrogen priming. In situ
hybridization showed that Scamp4 mRNA was less abundant in habenula and
ventromedial hypothalamus during proestrus, when circulating levels of
estrogen and progesterone are at their peak, than during diestrus-1,
when circulating hormone levels are low. Krebs and Pfaff (2001) noted
that Scamp4 mRNA levels are high in habenula, a brain area rich in mast
cells that may be involved in courtship behavior. They suggested that
SCAMP4 may be involved in reproductive behaviors associated with mast
cell activity in the central nervous system.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the SCAMP4 gene to chromosome 19p13.3 based on an
alignment of the SCAMP4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC011747) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

164790	TITLE *164790 NEUROBLASTOMA RAS VIRAL ONCOGENE HOMOLOG; NRAS
;;ONCOGENE NRAS; NRAS1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Marshall et al. (1982) identified a gene with transforming activity in 2
different human sarcoma cell lines, a fibrosarcoma (HT1080) and an
embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RD). Hall et al. (1983) identified this gene
as a member of the RAS gene family and designated it N-RAS 'after
consultation with Wigler and with Weinberg.' They found that NRAS was
also activated in a promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60) and a
neuroblastoma cell line (SK-H-SH). NRAS was present at the same levels
in normal fibroblasts and tumor cells. Hall and Brown (1985) identified
2 main NRAS transcripts of 4.3 kb and 2 kb.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hall and Brown (1985) determined that the NRAS gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis, Hall et al. (1983)
mapped the NRAS gene to chromosome 1. By in situ hybridization, Davis et
al. (1983) assigned the NRAS gene to the short arm of chromosome 1. A
concentration of grains was observed just above the centromere in band
1p13. They commented on the wide dispersion of the oncogenes in the RAS
family; each of the 5 mapped to date was on a separate chromosome. Ryan
et al. (1983) confirmed assignment of HRAS (190020) to chromosome 11,
KRAS2 (190070) to chromosome 12, and NRAS to chromosome 1. Addendum in
proof indicated that the same laboratory had assigned NRAS1 to 1p21-cen.
De Martinville et al. (1984) assigned NRAS to 1p31-cen. By somatic cell
hybrid studies and by in situ hybridization, Rabin et al. (1984)
assigned the NRAS gene to 1p13-p11. By in situ hybridization, Popescu et
al. (1985) also assigned the NRAS locus to 1p13-p11. Povey et al. (1985)
reviewed the conflicting evidence on the site of NRAS on 1p. They found
evidence favoring both 1p22 and 1p12-p11. Dracopoli and Meisler (1990)
concluded from linkage analysis and pulsed field gel electrophoresis
that TSHB (188540), NGFB (162030), and NRAS form a tightly linked gene
cluster located in the same chromosomal band. Their location proximal to
the AMY2B gene in 1p21 and close linkage to the alpha-satellite
centromeric repeat D1Z5 provided strong evidence that the correct
assignment for these 3 loci is 1p13 and not 1p22. Mitchell et al. (1995)
localized NRAS to 1p13.2 and CD2 (186990) and NGFB to 1p13.1. They
concluded that the order is as follows: cen--CD2--NGFB--NRAS--tel.

Using teratomas (see 166950) as a means of 'centromere mapping,' Deka et
al. (1989) estimated the NRAS-centromere distance (y) to be 0.30.

GENE FUNCTION

Substitution of ser17 with asn (S17N) in any of the RAS proteins
produces dominant-inhibitory proteins with higher affinities for
exchange factors than normal RAS. These mutants cannot interact with
downstream effectors and therefore form unproductive complexes,
preventing activation of endogenous RAS. Using experiments in COS-7
cells, mouse fibroblasts, and canine kidney cells, Matallanas et al.
(2003) found that the Hras, Kras, and Nras S17N mutants exhibited
distinct inhibitory effects that appeared to be due largely to their
specific membrane localizations. The authors demonstrated that Hras is
present in caveolae, lipid rafts, and bulk disordered membranes, whereas
Kras and Nras are present primarily in disordered membranes and lipid
rafts, respectively. Thus, the Hras S17N mutant inhibited activation of
all 3 wildtype RAS isoforms, the Kras S17N mutant inhibited wildtype
Kras and the portion of Hras in disordered membranes, and the Nras S17N
mutant inhibited wildtype Nras and the portion of Hras in lipid rafts.

Rocks et al. (2005) showed that the specific subcellular distribution of
HRAS and NRAS guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins is generated by a
constitutive de/reacylation cycle that operates on palmitoylated
proteins, driving their rapid exchange between the plasma membrane and
the Golgi apparatus. Depalmitoylation redistributes farnesylated Ras in
all membranes, followed by repalmitoylation and trapping of Ras at the
Golgi, from where it is redirected to the plasma membrane via the
secretory pathway. This continuous cycle prevents Ras from nonspecific
residence on endomembranes, thereby maintaining the specific
intracellular compartmentalization. Rocks et al. (2005) found that the
de/reacylation cycle also initiates Ras activation at the Golgi by
transport of plasma membrane-localized Ras guanosine triphosphate.
Different de/repalmitoylation kinetics account for isoform-specific
activation responses to growth factors.

Haigis et al. (2008) used genetically engineered mice to determine
whether and how the related oncogenes Kras (190070) and Nras regulate
homeostasis and tumorigenesis in the colon. Expression of Kras(G12D) in
the colonic epithelium stimulated hyperproliferation in a Mek (see
176872)-dependent manner. Nras(G12D) did not alter the growth properties
of the epithelium, but was able to confer resistance to apoptosis. In
the context of an Apc (611731)-mutant colonic tumor, activation of Kras
led to defects in terminal differentiation and expansion of putative
stem cells within the tumor epithelium. This Kras tumor phenotype was
associated with attenuated signaling through the MAPK pathway (see
176872), and human colon cancer cells expressing mutant Kras were
hypersensitive to inhibition of Raf (see 164760) but not Mek. Haigis et
al. (2008) concluded that their studies demonstrated clear phenotypic
differences between mutant Kras and Nras, and suggested that the
oncogenic phenotype of mutant Kras might be mediated by noncanonical
signaling through Ras effector pathways.

Nazarian et al. (2010) showed that acquired resistance of BRAF(V600E)
(164757.0001)-positive melanomas to PLX4032, a novel class I
RAF-selective inhibitor, develops by mutually exclusive PDGFRB (173410)
upregulation or NRAS mutations but not through secondary mutations in
BRAF(V600E). Nazarian et al. (2010) used PLX4032-resistant sublines
artificially derived from BRAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell lines and
validated key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumors and tumor-matched,
short-term cultures from clinical trial patients. Induction of PDGFRB
RNA, protein, and tyrosine phosphorylation emerged as a dominant feature
of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of melanoma sublines,
patient-derived biopsies, and short-term cultures. PDGFRB-upregulated
tumor cells had low activated RAS levels and, when treated with PLX4032,
did not reactivate the MAPK (see 176872) pathway significantly. In
another subset, high levels of activated NRAS resulting from mutations
led to significant MAPK pathway reactivation upon PLX4032 treatment.
Knockdown of PDGFRB or NRAS reduced growth of the respective
PLX4032-resistant subsets. Overexpression of PDGFRB or mutated NRAS
conferred PLX4032 resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines.
Importantly, Nazarian et al. (2010) showed that MAPK reactivation
predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, Nazarian et al. (2010)
concluded that melanomas escape BRAF(V600E) targeting not through
secondary BRAF(V600E) mutations but via receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK)-mediated activation of alternative survival pathway(s) or
activated RAS-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting
additional therapeutic strategies.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Role in Carcinoma

Using the allele-specific amplification method (ARMS), a highly
sensitive 1-stage allele-specific PCR, Bezieau et al. (2001) evaluated
the incidence of NRAS- and KRAS2-activating mutations (in codons 12, 13,
and 61) in 62 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma (MM), or primary plasma cell
leukemia (PPCL), and in human myeloma cell lines (HMCL). Mutations in
one or the other gene, or in both, were found in 54.5% of MM patients at
diagnosis (but in 81% at the time of relapse), 50% of PPCL patients, and
50% of 16 HMCL patients. In contrast, the occurrence of such mutations
was very low in MGUS and indolent MM (12.5%). KRAS2 mutations were
always more frequent than NRAS mutations. Bezieau et al. (2001)
concluded that these early mutations may play a major role in the
oncogenesis of multiple myeloid myeloma and primary plasma cell
leukemia.

Vasko et al. (2003) performed a pooled analysis of 269 mutations in
HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS garnered from 39 previous studies. Mutations proved
significantly less frequent when detected with direct sequencing than
without (12.3% vs 17%). The rates of mutation involving NRAS exon 1 and
KRAS exon 2 was less than 1%. Mutations of codon 61 of NRAS were
significantly more frequent in follicular tumors (19%) than in papillary
cancers (5%) and significantly more frequent in malignant (25%) than in
benign (14%) tumors. HRAS mutations in codons 12/13 were found in 2 to
3% of all types of tumors, but HRAS mutations in codon 61 were observed
in only 1.4% of tumors, and almost all of them were malignant. KRAS
mutations in exon 1 were found more often in papillary than follicular
cancers (2.7% vs 1.6%) and were sometimes correlated with special
epidemiologic circumstances. The second part of this study involved
analysis of 80 follicular tumors from patients living in Marseille
(France) and Kiev (Ukraine). HRAS mutations in codons 12/13 were found
in 12.5% of common adenomas and 1 follicular carcinoma (2.9%). Mutations
of codon 61 of NRAS occurred in 23.3% and 17.6% of atypical adenomas and
follicular carcinomas, respectively. The authors concluded that their
results confirmed the predominance of mutations of codon 61 of NRAS in
thyroid follicular tumors and their correlation with malignancy.

Nikiforova et al. (2003) analyzed a series of 88 conventional follicular
and Hurthle cell thyroid tumors for RAS (HRAS, NRAS, or KRAS) mutations
and PAX8 (167415)-PPARG (601487) rearrangements using molecular methods
and for galectin-3 (153619) and mesothelioma antibody HBME-1 expression
by immunohistochemistry. Forty-nine percent of conventional follicular
carcinomas had RAS mutations, 36% had PAX8-PPARG rearrangement, and only
1 (3%) had both. Of follicular adenomas, 48% had RAS mutations, 4% had
PAX8-PPARG rearrangement, and 48% had neither. Follicular carcinomas
with RAS mutations most often displayed an
HBME-1-positive/galectin-3-negative immunophenotype and were either
minimally or overtly invasive. Hurthle cell tumors infrequently had
PAX8-PPARG rearrangement or RAS mutations.

Johnson et al. (2005) found that the 3 human RAS genes, HRAS KRAS, and
NRAS, contain multiple let-7 (see 605386) miRNA complementary sites in
their 3-prime UTRs that allow let-7 miRNA to regulate their expression.
Let-7 expression was lower in lung tumors than in normal lung tissue,
whereas expression of the RAS proteins was significantly higher in lung
tumors, suggesting a possible mechanism for let-7 in cancer.

The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (2013) analyzed the genomes of
200 clinically annotated adult cases of de novo AML, using either
whole-genome sequencing (50 cases) or whole-exome sequencing (150
cases), along with RNA and microRNA sequencing and DNA methylation
analysis. The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (2013) identified
recurrent mutations in the NRAS or KRAS genes in 23/200 (12%) samples.

- Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome, Type IV

Oliveira et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous germline mutation in
the NRAS gene (G13D; 164790.0003) in a 49-year-old patient with an
atypical autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, which they designated
type IV (ALPS4; 614470). The patient had a lifelong overexpansion of
lymphocytes, childhood leukemia, and early adulthood lymphoma, both
successfully treated. He had increased serum alpha/beta-positive,
CD4-/CD8- T cells and follicular hyperplasia of the lymph nodes.

- Noonan Syndrome 6

Cirstea et al. (2010) identified 1 of 2 different heterozygous mutations
in the NRAS gene (T50I; 164790.0004 and G60E; 164790.0005) in 5
patients, including a mother and son, with Noonan syndrome-6 (NS6;
613224). The mutations were de novo in 3 patients. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the mutations resulted in enhanced
stimulus-dependent MAPK activation. The patients were part of a larger
study of 917 affected individuals who were negative for previously known
Noonan-associated gene mutations, suggesting that NRAS mutations are a
rare cause of Noonan syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mutations in the RB1 gene (614041) predispose humans and mice to tumor
development. Takahashi et al. (2006) assessed the effect of Nras loss on
tumor development in Rb1 heterozygous mice. Loss of 1 or 2 Nras alleles
significantly reduced the severity of pituitary tumors arising in Rb1
+/- animals by enhancing their differentiation. By contrast, C-cell
thyroid adenomas occurring in Rb1 +/- mice progressed to metastatic
medullary carcinomas after loss of Nras. In Rb1/Nras doubly heterozygous
mice, distant medullary thyroid carcinoma metastases were associated
with loss of the remaining wildtype Nras allele. Loss of Nras in
Rb1-deficient C cells resulted in elevated Ras homolog family A (RhoA)
activity, and this was causally linked to the invasiveness and
metastatic behavior of these cells. These findings suggested that the
loss of the protooncogene Nras in certain cellular contexts can promote
malignant tumor progression.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RECTAL CANCER, SOMATIC
NRAS, GLY13ARG

Nitta et al. (1987) found a G-to-C point mutation at the first letter of
codon 13 in the NRAS gene as the presumed basis for activation of the
gene in a case of rectal cancer (see 114500). The point mutation
resulted in the substitution of arginine for glycine.

.0002
THYROID CARCINOMA, FOLLICULAR, SOMATIC
EPIDERMAL NEVUS, SOMATIC, INCLUDED
NRAS, GLN61ARG

Nikiforova et al. (2003) found that the CAA-CGA mutation of NRAS codon
61, resulting in a gln-to-arg change (Q61R), was present in 70% (12) of
follicular carcinomas (188470) and 55% (6) of follicular adenomas
studied.

Hafner et al. (2012) identified a somatic Q61R mutation in 1 of 72
keratinocytic epidermal nevi (162900).

.0003
AUTOIMMUNE LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE SYNDROME, TYPE IV
JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC LEUKEMIA, INCLUDED;;
NOONAN SYNDROME 6, INCLUDED
NRAS, GLY13ASP

Oliveira et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition in
the NRAS gene, resulting in a gly13-to-asp (G13D) substitution, in a
49-year-old patient with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS4;
614470). The patient had a lifelong overexpansion of lymphocytes and a
history of childhood leukemia, and early adulthood lymphoma, both
successfully treated. There were no developmental defects. Laboratory
studies showed increased serum alpha/beta, CD4-/CD8- T cells and lymph
node follicular hyperplasia. There was no evidence of CD95
(134637)-mediated apoptosis, but the patient's lymphocytes resisted
death by IL2 (147680) withdrawal, indicating a specific defect in
lymphocyte apoptosis. Further studies of the patient's cells indicated a
decrease of the proapoptotic protein BIM (BCL2L11; 603827), which is
critical for withdrawal-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the G13D mutation resulted in
increased activation of NRAS. Oliveira et al. (2007) noted that the same
mutation had been identified somatically in myeloid and lymphoid
malignancies (Bos et al., 1985; Lubbert et al., 1990).

De Filippi et al. (2009) identified a de novo germline heterozygous G13D
substitution in the NRAS gene in a male infant who presented at age 2
months with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML; 607785) and was
later noted to have dysmorphic features suggestive of, but not
diagnostic of, Noonan syndrome (NS6; 613224). Features included short
stature, relative macrocephaly, high forehead, epicanthal folds, long
eyebrows, low nasal bridge, low-set ears, 2 cafe-au-lait spots, and low
scores on performance tasks. Cardiac studies were normal. There were no
hematologic abnormalities related to ALPS in this patient.

.0004
NOONAN SYNDROME 6
NRAS, THR50ILE

In 2 unrelated boys with Noonan syndrome-6 (613224), Cirstea et al.
(2010) identified a de novo heterozygous 149C-T transition in exon 3 of
the NRAS gene, resulting in a thr50-to-ile (T50I) substitution in a
conserved residue located in the beta-2-beta-3 loop connecting the 2
switch regions. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein resulted in enhanced downstream phosphorylation in the
presence of serum, but did not substantially affect intrinsic GTPase
activity. Molecular modeling indicated that thr50 interacts with the
polar heads of membrane phospholipids and is an integral part of a
region that controls RAS membrane orientation. Cirstea et al. (2010)
hypothesized that the T50I substitution might alter RAS orientation,
increase the interaction of GTP-bound RAS with its effectors, and
enhance a downstream signal flow consistent with a gain of function.

.0005
NOONAN SYNDROME 6
NRAS, GLY60GLU

In 3 patients from 2 unrelated families with Noonan syndrome-6 (613224),
Cirstea et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 179G-A transition in
exon 3 of the NRAS gene, resulting in a gly60-to-glu (G60E) substitution
in a conserved residue in the switch 2 region. One proband had a de novo
mutation, whereas the other inherited it from his affected mother. In
vitro functional expression studies showed that the mutant protein
resulted in enhanced downstream phosphorylation in the presence of
serum, and that the G60E mutant NRAS protein accumulated constitutively
in the active GTP-bound form, although it appeared to be resistant to
GAP stimulation.

.0006
EPIDERMAL NEVUS, SOMATIC
NRAS, PRO34LEU

Hafner et al. (2012) identified a somatic pro34-to-leu (P34L) mutation
in the NRAS gene in 1 of 72 keratinocytic epidermal nevi (162900).

.0007
EPIDERMAL NEVUS, SOMATIC
NRAS, GLY12ASP

Hafner et al. (2012) identified a somatic gly12-to-asp (G12D) mutation
in the NRAS gene in 1 of 72 keratinocytic epidermal nevi (162900).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

O'Connell et al. (1989, 1990) demonstrated by genetic linkage and by
somatic cell hybrid and pulsed field gel electrophoresis that EVI2
(EVI2A), the human homolog of the mouse myeloid leukemia-associated gene
Evi2, maps between 2 breakpoints on the proximal part of 17q that define
the neurofibromatosis I region (162200).

Cawthon et al. (1990) isolated EVI2A cDNAs from human bone marrow and
frontal cortex cDNA libraries. The deduced 232-amino acid protein is
predicted to be a glycosylated protein with a single membrane-spanning
domain, a leucine zipper motif, and a cytoplasmic domain. There is a
high degree of conservation between the human and mouse EVI2A proteins.

MAPPING

Viskochil et al. (1991) reported that 3 genes, EVI2A, OMGP (164345), and
EVI2B, are embedded within an intron of NF1 on chromosome 17q11.2. All 3
genes had the same transcriptional orientation, which was opposite to
that of the NF1 gene.

607477	TITLE *607477 G2- AND S-PHASE EXPRESSED GENE 1; GTSE1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database searching for homologs of mouse Gtse1, Monte et al. (2000)
identified an EST for GTSE1 and obtained a full-length clone. The
deduced 720-amino acid protein shares 65% sequence identity with mouse
Gtse1. Western blot analysis of transiently transfected COS-7 cells
revealed an apparent molecular mass of about 110 kD. Transient
transfection of osteosarcoma cells resulted in immunofluorescent
localization of GTSE1 to microtubules and colocalization with tubulin
(see 191130).

GENE FUNCTION

Monte et al. (2000) determined that osteosarcoma cells overexpressing
GTSE1 contained a large subpopulation of cells with 4N DNA, indicative
of a prolonged G2/M phase. Synchronized human fibroblasts expressed
undetectable amounts of GTSE1 mRNA and protein while at rest and at 12
hours following cell cycle reentry. At 24 hours following cell cycle
reentry, however, GTSE1 was expressed along with cyclin B (123836), a
G2-phase marker. Monte et al. (2000) concluded that GTSE1, like its
mouse homolog, is a microtubule-localized protein, is cell cycle
regulated, and can induce G2/M-phase accumulation when overexpressed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Monte et al. (2000) determined that the GTSE1 gene contains 11 exons and
spans about 33 kb. Exon 1 contains the 5-prime untranslated region and
the ATG initiator codon.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Monte et al. (2000) mapped the GTSE1 gene
to chromosome 22q13.2-q13.3. By interspecific test-cross analysis, they
mapped the mouse Gtse1 gene to chromosome 15.

611141	TITLE *611141 MINDBOMB, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2; MIB2
;;SKELETROPHIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using differential display to identify genes upregulated by truncated
SWI1 (ARID1A; 603024) in a neuroblastoma cell line, followed by
screening a brain cDNA library, Takeuchi et al. (2003) cloned MIB2,
which they called skeletrophin. The deduced 1,013-amino acid protein
contains a dystrophin (DMD; 300377)-like cysteine-rich zinc-binding
domain in its N-terminal half and 5 ankyrin (see 600465) repeats in its
C-terminal half. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.2-kb transcript
that was highly expressed in skeletal muscle and more weakly expressed
in brain, heart, and kidney. Western blot analysis detected a 70-kD
protein in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, but not in liver, thymus,
or lung. Immunohistochemical analysis of skeletal muscle detected
cytoplasmic foci of skeletrophin expression near the cell surface.

Takeuchi et al. (2005) stated that skeletrophin contains 2 C-terminal
RING-HC domains, the second of which is atypical. By database analysis,
they identified 6 skeletrophin splice variants. RT-PCR analysis showed
tissue-specific expression of 3 of the variants. Dot blot analysis using
a cDNA encoding the N-terminal half of skeletrophin as probe revealed
widespread expression, with highest levels in skeletal muscle.

Koo et al. (2005) identified mouse and human MIB2 as paralogs of
zebrafish Mib (MIB1; 608677). MIB2 has a HERC2 (605837)/Mib domain on
each side of the zinc finger domain, as well as a Mib repeat prior to
the ankyrin repeats. Mouse tissues expressed 2 major Mib2 variants, and
overall expression was higher in neonates and adults than in embryos.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, Takeuchi et al.
(2003) showed that skeletrophin interacted with alpha-actin (ACTA1;
102610). Skeletrophin was expressed in 23 of 25 benign nevi, but not in
18 of 38 cases of primary skin melanoma. Treatment with a demethylating
agent restored skeletrophin expression in a human melanoma cell line.

Takeuchi et al. (2005) showed that a recombinant protein containing only
the RING domains of skeletrophin promoted autoubiquitination in a UBCH5B
(UBE2D2; 602962)-dependent manner. Mutation of cys969 in the second RING
motif eliminated the activity, whereas mutation of cys891 in the first
RING motif had no effect. Protein pull-down assays showed that
full-length skeletrophin bound Jagged-2 (JAG2; 602570), but it did not
bind other Notch (see NOTCH1; 190198) ligands tested. Skeletrophin
ubiquitinated the intracellular domain of JAG2, and immunohistochemical
analysis indicated that skeletrophin expression altered the
intracellular localization of JAG2. Overexpression of skeletrophin in a
mouse myeloma cell line induced expression of the Notch effector Hes1
(139605) in cocultured mouse stromal cells by direct cell-cell contact.
RING finger-mutated skeletrophin did not enhance Hes1 expression.
Takeuchi et al. (2005) found elevated skeletrophin expression in 23 of
40 multiple myeloma specimens, especially from patients with osteolytic
bone lesions.

Koo et al. (2005) showed that the RING domains of mouse Mib2 had E3
ubiquitin ligase activity. Mutation of the second RING domain, but not
the first, reduced the activity. Full-length Mib2 underwent
autoubiquitination in transfected cells, an effect that was dramatically
increased in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. Mib2 interacted
with Xenopus Delta (XD; see 606582) in transfected cells, and mutation
analysis showed that the intracellular domain of XD interacted with the
N-terminal region of Mib2. In transfected HeLa cells, mouse Mib2
colocalized with an early endosomal marker, and coexpression of Mib2
with XD caused ubiquitination of XD and relocalization of XD from the
cell surface into cytoplasmic vesicular structures. Mib2 rescued both
the neuronal and vascular defects in the zebrafish Mib mutant,
confirming that Mib2 acts along the Notch signaling pathway.

Takeuchi et al. (2006) found aberrant methylation of the skeletrophin
promoter in 6 of 31 invasive melanomas, but in none of 25 benign nevi or
5 noninvasive superficial spreading melanomas. The zinc finger
transcription factor SNAIL (see SNAI1; 604238), which is overexpressed
in many melanoma cells, repressed the skeletrophin promoter via an E
box-related element and was involved in downregulation of skeletrophin.
AP2 (TFAP2A; 107580) increased skeletrophin expression. Exogenous
expression of skeletrophin reduced melanoma cell invasion in vitro and
in vivo, and colony formation in soft agar was reduced in a RING
motif-dependent manner, without affecting cell growth. Skeletrophin
downregulated transcription of MET (164860) and increased expression of
HES1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Takeuchi et al. (2005) determined that the MIB2 gene contains 18 exons
and spans 14 kb.

Takeuchi et al. (2006) found that the MIB2 promoter region is GC rich
and lacks typical TATA and CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Takeuchi et al. (2003) mapped the MIB2 gene to chromosome
1p36.3-p36.2. Takeuchi et al. (2005) mapped the MIB2 gene to chromosome
1p36.32 by genomic sequence analysis.

601710	TITLE *601710 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 5; EIF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor-5 (EIF5) interacts with the 40S
initiation complex to promote hydrolysis of bound GTP with concomitant
joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to the 40S initiation complex. The
resulting functional 80S ribosomal initiation complex is then active in
peptidyl transfer and chain elongations (summary by Si et al., 1996).

CLONING

Si et al. (1996) cloned the gene encoding human EIF5. The gene encodes a
predicted 431-amino acid polypeptide that shares significant homology
with the rat sequence. The authors also characterized multiple mRNAs
expressed from the rat EIF5 gene and found that they differ only in the
lengths of their 3-prime untranslated regions. The transcript length
variations are tissue specific and arise from use of alternative
polyadenylation signals.

GENE FUNCTION

Das et al. (2001) characterized recombinant rat Eif5. They identified an
N-terminal GTPase-activating domain in addition to the C-terminal
Eif2-beta (EIF2S2; 603908)-binding region. Mutation analysis revealed 1
critical arginine and 2 critical lysine residues near the N terminus
that were essential for Eif5 function. Das et al. (2001) concluded that
Eif5 functions as a GTPase-activating protein.

EIF5 functions in start site selection as a GTPase accelerating protein
(GAP) for the EIF2-GTP-tRNAi(Met) ternary complex within the
ribosome-bound preinitiation complex (summary by Jennings and Pavitt,
2010). Jennings and Pavitt (2010) defined new regulatory functions of
EIF5 in the recycling of EIF2 from its inactive EIF2-GDP state between
successive rounds of translation initiation. First, the authors showed
that EIF5 stabilizes the binding of GDP to EIF2 and is therefore a
bifunctional protein that acts as a GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI).
Jennings and Pavitt (2010) found that this activity is independent of
the GAP function and identified conserved residues within EIF5 that are
necessary for this role. In addition, Jennings and Pavitt (2010) showed
that EIF5 is a critical component of the EIF2(alpha-P) regulatory
complex that inhibits the activity of the guanine-nucleotide exchange
factor (GEF) EIF2B (603908). Jennings and Pavitt (2010) concluded that
their findings defined a new step in the translation initiation pathway,
one that is critical for normal translational controls.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the EIF5 gene to chromosome 14q32.32 based on an
alignment of the EIF5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK U494936) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

;;BETA-KETOACYL SYNTHASE, MITOCHONDRIAL; KS
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

OXSM is a mitochondrial beta-ketoacyl synthase (EC 2.3.1.41) involved in
mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis. It is required for catalysis of the
chain-elongating condensation reaction (Zhang et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching human genomic and EST databases with prokaryotic
beta-ketoacyl synthase sequences as probes, followed by PCR, Zhang et
al. (2005) cloned OXSM. The deduced 459-amino acid protein has a
predicted molecular mass of 45.8 kD that was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. It
contains an N-terminal 38-amino acid sequence that functions as a
mitochondrial targeting signal as well as other conserved sequences
including a cysteine nucleophile, two catalytic histidine residues, and
a C-terminal glycine-rich motif. Northern blot analysis detected highest
expression in heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney, with lower
levels in placenta, brain, spleen, and lung. Little or no expression was
detected in colon, thymus, and leukocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2005) demonstrated that OXSM functionally complements the
yeast mutant cem1, which is characterized by a nuclear-encoded
respiratory-defective petite phenotype. Using purified histidine-tagged
OXSM, Zhang et al.(2005) showed that OXSM displays beta-ketoacyl
synthase activity, catalyzing elongation of mitochondrial acyl-ACP
(NDUFAB1; 603836) thioesters containing 2- to 14-carbon acyl moieties,
and showed highest affinities for the 4-carbon to 12-carbon acyl-ACP
thioesters. OXSM enzyme activity was inhibited by cerulenin, an
inhibitor of other fatty acid synthase systems.

MAPPING

By database sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2005) mapped the OXSM gene
to chromosome 3p24.2 and the mouse homolog to chromosome 14.

HOP2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; HOP2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PSMC3IP gene encodes a nuclear, tissue-specific protein with
multiple functions, including a role in meiotic recombination and as a
coactivator of ligand-dependent transcription mediated by nuclear
hormone receptors (summary by Zangen et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing putative genes centromeric to the BRCA1 gene (113705) on
chromosome 17, followed by screening a breast cancer cell line cDNA
library, Rommens et al. (1995) cloned GT198. The deduced protein
contains 203 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.6-kb
transcript in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with abundant
expression in testis, colon, a breast cancer cell line, and a lymphoma.

Tanaka et al. (1997) cloned Gt198, which they called Tbpip, from a mouse
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein has several
putative phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected Tbpip expression in CD4
(186940)-positive T cells and in macrophages. In situ hybridization
found Tbpip mRNA colocalized with Tbp1 (186852) in seminiferous tubules
of adult mouse testis. Western blot analysis detected Tbpip at an
apparent molecular mass of 24 kD. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse
testis detected Tbpip in nuclei of primary and secondary spermatocytes.

By PCR using primers designed from mouse Tbpip, Ijichi et al. (2000)
cloned full-length human TBPIP from breast cancer cell line mRNA and a
testis cDNA library. The deduced 217-amino acid protein contains an
acidic region near the C terminus and several putative phosphorylation
sites. Mouse and human TBPIP share 88% amino acid homology.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Rommens et al. (1995) mapped the TBPIP
gene to chromosome 17q21. Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ijichi et al.
(2000) mapped the TBPIP gene to chromosome 17q12-q21.

GENE FUNCTION

The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Tat is
essential for HIV-1 gene expression and replication in infected cells.
TBP1 is a cellular protein that suppresses Tat-mediated transactivation
of HIV replication. Tanaka et al. (1997) found that mouse Tbpip
synergistically cooperated with Tbp1 to suppress Tat-mediated
transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter.

Ijichi et al. (2000) showed that human TBPIP interacted directly with
TBP1 and enhanced TBP1-mediated inhibition of HIV Tat-mediated
transactivation.

Enomoto et al. (2006) demonstrated that coexpression of human MND1
(611422) and HOP2 in E. coli resulted in the formation of stable
heterodimers. The HOP2-MND1 complex stimulated DMC1 (602721)- and RAD51
(179617)-mediated DNA strand exchange, and preferentially bound to a
3-stranded DNA branch, which mimics the strand-exchange intermediate.
Enomoto et al. (2006) concluded that the HOP2-MND1 complex may ensure
proper pairing between homologous chromosomes by stimulating strand
exchange during meiosis.

Chi et al. (2007) found that the Hop2 component of the mouse recombinant
Hop2-Mnd1 complex was the major DNA-binding subunit, and that Mnd1 was
the Rad51-interacting entity. Hop2-Mnd1 stabilized the
Rad51-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) nucleoprotein filament, and enhanced
the ability of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament to capture duplex
DNA, which is an obligatory step in the formation of the synaptic
complex critical for DNA joint formation. Pezza et al. (2007) showed
that the mouse Hop2-Mnd1 complex stimulated Dmc1 to promote synaptic
complex formation on long duplex DNAs. Synaptic alignment was a
consequence of the ability of Hop2-Mnd1 to stabilize the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein complex and facilitate the conjoining of DNA molecules
through the capture of double-stranded DNA by the Dmc1-ssDNA
nucleoprotein filament.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree with
hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis mapping to chromosome 17 (ODG3;
614324), Zangen et al. (2011) analyzed candidate genes and identified
homozygosity for a 3-bp deletion in the PSMC3IP gene (608665.0001) that
segregated with disease in the family. In cell lines, the glu201del
mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven transcription.

ANIMAL MODEL

Petukhova et al. (2003) found that Hop2 knockout mice showed no gross
anomalies in somatic tissues but developed a profound deficiency in
gametogenesis. Hop2 -/- spermatocytes arrested at the stage of
pachytene-like chromosome condensation. Axial elements were fully
developed, but synapsis was limited. While meiotic double-stranded
breaks were formed and processed in Hop2 -/- mice, they failed to be
repaired.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OVARIAN DYSGENESIS 3
PSMC3IP, 3-BP DEL, 600GAG

In affected members of a large consanguineous Arab Palestinian pedigree
with hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis (ODG3; 614324), Zangen et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for an in-frame 3-bp deletion in the
acceptor splice junction of exon 8 of the PSMC3IP gene, resulting in
deletion of glu201. The unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
deletion, which was not found in 254 ethnically matched chromosomes.
RT-PCR analysis of leukocyte DNA from affected and unaffected family
members showed no alternative splicing, suggesting that the mutation
does not affect PSMC3IP splicing. Transfection studies in the IGROV1
ovarian carcinoma and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that
the glu201del mutation abolished PSMC3IP activation of estrogen-driven
transcription.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The SR family of mRNA splicing factors was so designated because SR
proteins contain sequences of consecutive serine (S) and arginine (R)
dipeptides. Zahler et al. (1992) identified 6 SR proteins in HeLa cell
extracts, and named them SRp30a (600812), SRp30b (600813), SRp40
(600914), SRp20, SRp55 (601944), and SRp75 (601940), based on their
apparent molecular masses. By searching a sequence database with the
partial protein sequence of SRp20, the authors found that a previously
identified cDNA, X16, encoded mouse SRp20. Using PCR with primers based
on the X16 sequence, they cloned a HeLa cell cDNA encoding human SRp20.
The predicted 164-amino acid mouse and human proteins are identical. The
sequence of the SRp20 protein is related to those of the other SR
proteins identified; all contain 1 or 2 copies of an N-terminal repeat
(A and B) spaced by a series of glycine residues that may form a
flexible hinge, followed by a C-terminal SR domain. The A repeat
contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM). SRp20 and SRp30b contain repeat
A only. Zahler et al. (1992) reported that all animal cells tested
expressed at least 6 SR proteins. They suggested that SR proteins have
different specificities for subclasses of pre-mRNAs and that regulation
of the levels of SR proteins in different cell types contributes to the
regulation of cell-specific splice choices.

GENE FUNCTION

Lou et al. (1998) demonstrated that SRp20 affected the recognition of an
alternative 3-prime-terminal exon via an effect on the efficiency of
binding of the 64-kD subunit of CSTF (300907), a polyadenylation factor,
to an alternative polyadenylation site. They suggested that SR proteins
can influence pre-mRNA processing at the level of polyadenylation and
generally participate in terminal exon recognition.

Jumaa et al. (1997) demonstrated that in vivo, SRp20 mRNA levels are
cell cycle regulated and that the SRp20 mRNA is itself alternatively
spliced, apparently in a cell cycle-specific manner. Sequence analysis
revealed that the SRp20 promoter contains 2 consensus binding sites for
E2F (189971), a transcription factor thought to be involved in
regulating the cell cycle. The authors suggested that cellular pre-mRNA
splicing may be regulated during the cell cycle, perhaps in part by
regulated expression of SR proteins.

Lareau et al. (2007) reported that in every member of the human SR
family of splicing regulators, highly or ultraconserved elements are
alternatively spliced, either as alternative 'poison cassette exons'
containing early in-frame stop codons, or as alternative introns in the
3-prime untranslated region. These alternative splicing events target
the resulting mRNAs for degradation by means of an RNA surveillance
pathway called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Mouse orthologs of the
human SR proteins exhibit the same unproductive splicing patterns. Three
SR proteins, SRp20, SC35 (600813), and 9G8 (SFRS7; 600572), had been
previously shown to direct splicing of their own transcripts, and SC35
autoregulates its expression by coupling alternative splicing with
decay. Lareau et al. (2007) concluded that unproductive splicing is
important for regulation of the entire SR family and found that
unproductive splicing associated with conserved regions has arisen
independently in different SR genes, suggesting that splicing factors
may readily acquire this form of regulation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jumaa et al. (1997) found that the mouse SRp20 gene contains 6 exons and
an additional alternative exon.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross analysis, Jumaa et al. (1997) mapped the
mouse SRp20 gene to a 2-centimorgan interval on chromosome 17.

610497	TITLE *610497 BRAIN AND REPRODUCTIVE ORGAN-EXPRESSED PROTEIN; BRE
;;BRCC4;;
BRCC45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Li et al. (1995) cloned BRE from a placenta cDNA library. The deduced
protein contains 383 amino acids. Northern blot analysis of normal human
fibroblasts detected a single BRE mRNA at 1.7 to 1.9 kb. Northern blot
analysis of several rat tissues detected highest expression in testis
and intermediate expression in brain and ovary. Using the juxtamembrane
domain of the p55 TNF receptor (TNFRSF1A; 191190) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen, Gu et al. (1998) cloned Bre from a mouse cerebellum
cDNA library.

GENE FUNCTION

Li et al. (1995) found that the expression of BRE decreased following
DNA damage in normal human fibroblasts caused by UV irradiation or
4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) exposure. Similar decreased BRE
expression was observed in retinoic acid-treated human brain glioma
cells and promyelocytic cells. BRE expression was unchanged in cells
following growth inhibition.

Using protein-binding assays and immunoprecipitation analysis in HEK293
cells, Gu et al. (1998) confirmed the interaction between mouse Bre and
Tnfrsf1a. Bre specifically interacted with Tnfrsf1a but not with other
TNF family members. Overexpression of Bre inhibited TNF-induced
NF-kappa-B activation.

Dong et al. (2003) demonstrated that in human cell lines BRE and BRCC3
(300617) are components of a holoenzyme complex containing BRCA1
(113705), BRCA2 (600185), BARD1 (601593), and RAD51 (179617), which they
called the BRCA1- and BRCA2-containing complex (BRCC). The complex
showed UBC5 (see UBE2D1; 602961)-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligase activity.
Inclusion of BRE and BRCC3 enhanced ubiquitination by the complex, and
cancer-associated truncations in BRCA1 reduced the association of BRE
and BRCC3 with the complex. RNA interference of BRE and BRCC3 in HeLa
cells increased cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and resulted in a
defect in G2/M checkpoint arrest. Dong et al. (2003) concluded that the
BRCC is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that enhances cellular survival following
DNA damage.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the BRE
gene to chromosome 2 (TMAP RH66226).

;;PROTEOGLYCAN II;;
PG II;;
PG40
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Decorin and biglycan (301870) are related but distinct small
proteoglycans found in many connective tissues. Using Northern blot
analysis or RT-PCR, Danielson et al. (1993) detected the 2 alternatively
spliced leader exons of the DCN gene in a variety of mRNAs isolated from
human cell lines and tissues. Sequences highly homologous (74-87%) to
exons Ia and Ib were found in the 5-prime untranslated region of avian
and bovine decorin, respectively. This high degree of conservation among
species suggested regulatory functions for these leader exons. In situ
hybridization studies of developing mouse embryos suggested that decorin
may play a role in epithelial/mesenchymal interactions during organ
development and shaping (Scholzen et al., 1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

Danielson et al. (1993) found that the human decorin gene spans more
than 38 kb and contains 8 exons and very large introns, 2 of which are
5.4 and more than 13.2 kb. They discovered 2 alternatively spliced
leader exons, Ia and Ib, in the 5-prime untranslated region.

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs
with cDNA probes, McBride et al. (1990) assigned the DCN gene to
chromosome 12. Regionalization to 12p12.1-qter was obtained by examining
hybrids containing spontaneous breaks or well-characterized
translocations involving chromosome 12. Hybridization with subfragment
cDNA probes suggested the presence of 2 copies of the DCN gene, or
related sequences, at the locus on chromosome 12, although there was no
evidence for the function of more than one DCN gene. By in situ
hybridization, Pulkkinen et al. (1992) placed the DCN gene at 12q21-q22.
Vetter et al., (1993) mapped the human decorin gene by in situ
hybridization to 12q21.3. Using a genomic clone as the labeled probe and
in situ hybridization, Danielson et al. (1993) mapped the DCN gene to
12q23. They specifically noted that there were 4 times as many grains
centered on 12q23 as on 12q21, where Pulkkinen et al. (1992) had placed
the probable site. In a study of candidate genes for Noonan syndrome
(163950), Ion et al. (2000) reassigned the map position of DCN to
12q13.2 using FISH. Scholzen et al. (1994) assigned the homologous gene
in the mouse to chromosome 10, using interspecific backcrossing.

GENE FUNCTION

Vogel and Clark (1989) found little evidence that the metabolism of
either decorin or biglycan is altered by abnormalities in the structure
or secretion of types I and III collagen. In a presumably homozygous
case of the Marfan syndrome (154700) reported by Schollin et al. (1988),
Pulkkinen et al. (1990) found markedly decreased level of mRNA for
decorin, markedly decreased decorin polypeptide in the culture medium of
fibroblasts from the infant, and deficient effect of interleukin-1-beta
(147720) on the transcription of decorin as tested in these fibroblasts.
In 3 of 12 other unrelated Marfan patients, they also found deficient
decorin expression.

Dyne et al. (1996) studied 2 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and
the same gly415-to-ser mutation of the COL1A1 gene (120150.0044), but a
different clinical expression. They speculated that these differences
could be the result of abnormalities in other connective tissue
proteins. Since decorin is a component of connective tissue, binds to
type I collagen fibrils, and plays a role in matrix assembly, they
studied decorin production in skin fibroblasts from these 2 patients.
Cultured fibroblasts from the patient with extremely severe osteogenesis
imperfecta (classified as type II/III) were found to secrete barely
detectable amounts of decorin into culture medium. Northern blot
analysis showed decorin mRNA levels below the limit of detection. The
patient with a less severe phenotype had fibroblasts that expressed
decorin normally. Dyne et al. (1996) suggested that the different
clinical phenotypes could be due to the differing genetic backgrounds of
the patients, such that in the more severely affected patient the
absence of decorin aggravated the clinical phenotype.

When expressed ectopically, decorin is capable of suppressing the growth
of various tumor cell lines. Moscatello et al. (1998) demonstrated that
it induced a marked growth suppression in A431 squamous carcinoma cells,
when either exogenously added or endogenously produced by a transgene.
Decorin caused rapid phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (131550) and a
concurrent activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signal
pathway. Thus, EGF and decorin converge functionally to regulate the
cell cycle through activation of a common pathway that ultimately leads
to growth suppression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a family with congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD; 610048),
Bredrup et al. (2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion in the
last exon, which they erroneously labeled exon 10 (Rodahl, 2009), of the
DCN gene (125255.0001). The deletion was found in all affected family
members but not in any healthy family member or in 200 normal controls.

In a Norwegian family originally reported by Odland (1968) with
congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD; 610048), Bredrup et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (967delT) in the last
exon, which they erroneously labeled exon 10 (Rodahl, 2009), of the DCN
gene. The mutation was predicted to lead to a frameshift, alteration of
4 amino acids, and loss of the C-terminal 33 amino acids (S323fsX5).
Bredrup et al. (2005) postulated that the defective interaction of
mutant decorin with collagen would disturb the regularity of corneal
collagen in affected heterozygotes.

;;HPAII TINY FRAGMENTS LOCUS 9C; HTF9C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) cloned mouse Htf9c, which encodes a deduced
676-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 75 kD. Htf9c
has a putative N-terminal nuclear targeting signal and a C-terminal
domain similar to yeast and bacterial nucleic acid-modifying enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) found that mouse Htf9c and Ranbp1 (601180)
were divergently transcribed from a bidirectional promoter. Expression
of both genes was activated upon entry into the cell cycle, peaked in S
phase, and was downregulated during completion of the cell cycle. The
bidirectional promoter was downregulated in both orientations in
arrested cells. Activation of the promoter was specific, resulting in
more restricted Htf9c expression and a sharper peak of Htf9c expression
in S phase compared with Ranbp1 expression. A region containing an E2f
(189971) site was important for cell cycle control of Htf9c, and a
common region containing sites for Sp1 (189906) and E2f contributed to
activation in both orientations.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the HTF9C gene to chromosome 22q11.21 based on an
alignment of the TRMT2A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025106) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

;;D2HGD
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.-) converts
D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) to 2-ketoglutarate (Achouri et al., 2004).

CLONING

Achouri et al. (2004) isolated and characterized rat D2hgdh and by
database analysis identified human D2HGDH, which encodes a 521-amino
acid protein. Subcellular fractionation of rat livers indicated that rat
D2hgdh was present in the mitochondrial fraction. Assays of
D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase in rat tissues indicated that this
enzyme is most active in liver and kidney but is also active in heart
and brain (Struys et al., 2005). Kranendijk et al. (2010) noted that the
D2HGDH protein contains 522 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kranendijk et al. (2010) noted that the D2HGDH gene contains 10 exons
with a noncoding exon 1.

MAPPING

Kranendijk et al. (2010) noted that the D2HGDH gene maps to chromosome
2p25.3. Hartz (2010) mapped the D2HGDH gene to chromosome 2q37.3 based
on an alignment of the D2HGDH sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK027102) with
the genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (600721) is a neurometabolic disorder
characterized by developmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, and
dysmorphic features. Struys et al. (2005) identified mutations in the
D2HGDH gene (609186.0001-609186.0003) in 2 unrelated patients with
severe D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.

In individuals from 2 unrelated families with mild forms of
D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, Struys et al. (2005) identified mutations
in the D2HGDH gene (609186.0004 and 609186.0005).

In a white Italian boy with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (600721) born
to healthy first-cousin parents, Struys et al. (2005) found homozygosity
for a 1331T-to-C transition in exon 9 of the D2HGD gene that resulted in
a val444-to-ala (V444A) amino acid substitution. The patient exhibited
psychomotor retardation, episodes of vomiting, and tonic, tonic-clonic,
and myoclonic seizures that were not responsive to antiepileptic
treatment. He died at 2 years of age.

In a white American girl with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (600721) born
to nonconsanguineous parents of mixed ancestry, described by Gibson et
al. (1993), Struys et al. (2005) found compound heterozygosity for
mutations in the D2HGD gene: a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 440 in
exon 2 that resulted in an ile147-to-ser (I147S) substitution, and a
splice site mutation (609186.0003). Overexpression studies in HEK-293
cells of the mutant missense protein showed a marked reduction of
D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase activity. The patient presented with
generalized tonic-clonic seizures, infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia,
hypotonia, a movement disorder, cortical blindness, and developmental
delay.

D-2-@HYDROXYGLUTARIC ACIDURIA 1
D2HGDH, IVS1, A-G, -23

In a white American girl with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (600721),
Struys et al. (2005) found compound heterozygosity for a splice site
mutation, IVS1-23A-G, and a missense mutation (609186.0002). The
IVS1-23A-G mutation created an alternative splice acceptor site located
19 nucleotides upstream of the wildtype splice acceptor site, causing an
insertion of 19 nucleotides into the mature mRNA and resulting in
frameshift and premature termination (cys100fsX9).

D-2-@HYDROXYGLUTARIC ACIDURIA 1
D2HGDH, IVS4, A-G, -2

In 2 asymptomatic sibs, born of consanguineous Palestinian parents, with
D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (600721), Struys et al. (2005) identified a
homozygous A-to-G transition at the -2 position of intron 4 of the D2HGD
gene, resulting in a splice site mutation. The sibs showed normal
development at ages 10 and 3 years, respectively. Both parents were
heterozygous for the mutation, and it was not identified in 210 control
chromosomes. Studies in cultured fibroblasts indicated that the mutant
mRNA was unstable.

.0005
D-2-@HYDROXYGLUTARIC ACIDURIA 1
D2HGDH, ASN439ASP

In a Palestinian child, born of consanguineous parents, with a mild form
of D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (600721), Struys et al. (2005)
identified a homozygous 1315A-G transition in the D2HGD gene, resulting
in an asn439-to-asp (N439D) substitution. Overexpression of the mutant
protein showed that the enzyme had approximately 13% residual activity.
Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation, and it was not
identified in 210 control chromosomes.

.0006
D-2-@HYDROXYGLUTARIC ACIDURIA 1
D2HGDH, 2-BP DUP, 326TC

In 2 monozygotic twin sisters with D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria
(600721), Misra et al. (2005) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the D2HGDH gene: a 2-bp duplication in exon 2 (326dupTC),
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination, and a 1123G-T
transversion in exon 7, resulting in an asp375-to-tyr (D375Y;
609186.0007) substitution. The girls were 4.5 years old, born of
nonconsanguineous African American parents, and had markedly different
phenotypes. The more severely affected girl had multiple congenital
anomalies, hypotonia, severe developmental delay, epileptic
encephalopathy, and cortical atrophy with periventricular leukomalacia.
In contrast, her sister had a normal neurocognitive and neuroradiologic
phenotype without congenital abnormalities. Both girls had similar
dysmorphic facies, with dolichocephaly, malar flattening, and broad
nasal root. Both also had a similar biochemical profiles. The discordant
phenotype indicated that epigenetic differences or environmental factors
must have influenced the phenotypic response to the biochemical defect,
rather than allelic heterogeneity.

602145	TITLE *602145 PROLIFERATION-ASSOCIATED 2G4, 38-KD; PA2G4
;;ERBB3-BINDING PROTEIN 1; EBP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The mouse Pa2g4 gene was isolated by Radomski and Jost (1995) by
screening a cDNA expression library from a murine macrophage cell line
with the antibody mAb2G4. This monoclonal antibody was generated against
a single-stranded DNA-binding protein to identify proteins showing cell
cycle specific variation in nuclear localization. The protein encoded by
Pa2g4, p38-2G4, was shown to be confined to the nucleus during
interphase and early prophase, but distributed throughout the cytoplasm
from metaphase through to telophase. In addition, p38-2G4 was found to
be highly expressed between G1 and mid-S phase, decreasing toward the
end of S phase and ceasing at the S/G2 transition. As the protein is
expressed in response to mitogen stimulation, it may belong to a large
family of cell cycle regulatory proteins or replication proteins that
maintain the cell cycle activities of proliferating cells. It appears to
be a proliferation-dependent gene that probably encodes a nuclear
DNA-binding protein involved in the control of cell replication.

Lamartine et al. (1997) isolated and characterized human PA2G4. A cDNA
of 1,697 nucleotides was predicted to encode a protein of 394 amino
acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of this human protein showed very
strong homology to the mouse protein p38-2G4.

Liu et al. (2006) identified isoforms of Ebp1 with apparent molecular
masses of 48 and 42 kD by SDS-PAGE in the rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cell
line. The 48-kD isoform (p48) localized to both the cytoplasm and
nucleus of PC12 cells, whereas the 42-kD isoform (p42) was predominantly
localized in the cytoplasm.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2006) found that the p48 isoform of Ebp1 suppressed
apoptosis in rat PC12 cells, whereas the cytoplasmic p42 isoform
promoted cell differentiation. EGF (131530) stimulated p42 to bind ERBB3
(190151) in transfected human embryonic kidney cells, and the
association depended on PKC (see PRKCA; 176960)-mediated phosphorylation
of p42. p48 did not bind ERBB3 regardless of EGF treatment.
Overexpression of p48 induced PC12 cell proliferation, which was
inhibited by p42. Nerve growth factor (NGFB; 162030) elicited extensive
sprouting in p42-transfected PC12 cells, whereas p48 induced only modest
neurite outgrowth. Akt (AKT1; 164730) was more active in p48 cells than
in p42 cells. Liu et al. (2006) concluded that EBP1 may regulate cell
survival and differentiation through 2 distinctive isoforms.

MAPPING

Lamartine et al. (1997) concluded that PA2G4 belongs to a gene family
with members in several chromosome regions: 3q24-q25, 6q22, 9q21, 12q13,
18q12, 20p12, and Xq25. They suggested that the human PA2G4 cDNA they
analyzed probably corresponds to a functional copy at chromosome 12q13.

600267	TITLE *600267 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, NONRECEPTOR-TYPE, 13; PTPN13
;;PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE PTPL1;;
FAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE 1; FAP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a PCR-based approach, Saras et al. (1994) cloned a cytoplasmic
protein tyrosine phosphatase of nonreceptor type, which they designated
PTPL1. Overlapping cDNA clones encompassed an open reading frame of
7,398 bp, predicting a 2,466-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of
275 kD. PTPL1 was found to have a wide tissue distribution, a 9.5-kb
transcript being expressed in most tissues. PTPL1 has a protein-tyrosine
phosphatase domain located in the C terminus. In the nonenzymatic part
of PTPL1, 3 different structural motifs were identified; 2 of these are
often found in proteins at the interface between the plasma membrane and
the cytoskeleton, namely, a domain with similarity to the band 4.1
(130500) superfamily, and a region consisting of 5 copies of an 80-amino
acid repeat found in a variety of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. In
addition, PTPL1 has a leucine zipper motif. Saras et al. (1994) noted
that PTPL1 was the largest known PTP and the only one known to contain a
leucine zipper motif. Its structure suggests that it may be able to form
dimers and may localize to the submembranous cytoskeleton.

Both Banville et al. (1994) and Maekawa et al. (1994) isolated the same
nonreceptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTPN13, which they
referred to as hPTP1E and PTP-BAS, respectively. Maekawa et al. (1994)
originally isolated a PCR product from basophil mRNA using degenerate
primers and RT-PCR. This was used as a probe to screen a
basophil-enriched KU812E cell cDNA library. The fully characterized cDNA
was over 8.1 kb and encoded a 2,485-amino acid predicted reading frame.
The Banville et al. (1994) cDNA was isolated by screening a ZR-75-1
breast carcinoma cell line at low stringency with a probe for LAR cDNA
(179590). The cDNA they identified was over 8.3 kb long and encoded a
2,490-amino acid reading frame. Both groups noted that the N-terminal
region contains motifs showing similarity to the GLGF motifs found in
guanylate kinase proteins that may play a role in the subcellular
distribution of these proteins within specialized structures of the cell
membrane where cell-cell interactions occur. Maekawa et al. (1994)
presented evidence for alternative splicing producing at least 3
different isoforms of PTPN13. Banville et al. (1994) expressed the
protein in E. coli and showed that the recombinant protein had the
expected protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. Northern blot analysis
showed expression in a variety of tissues with especially high levels in
the kidney, lung, and fetal brain.

PTPN13 binds to a negative regulatory domain in Fas that inhibits
Fas-induced apoptosis; it has therefore also been called Fas-associated
protein-tyrosine-1 (FAP1) (Inazawa et al., 1996).

GENE STRUCTURE

Yoshida et al. (2002) determined that the PTPN13 gene is located only
633 bp upstream from JNK3 (602897) in a head-to-head orientation. A
short G/C-rich region between the cap sites of the 2 genes suggested
that they might share a bidirectional promoter region that appears to
contain multiple cis elements. They found that the PTPN13 gene, which
contains 48 exons, initiates transcription within exon 2 and terminates
in exon 48.

MAPPING

Banville et al. (1994) assigned the PTPN13 gene to chromosome 11 by PCR
of somatic cell hybrid DNAs. In an erratum, they stated that the gene
had been assigned to chromosome 4 and not 11 as reported.

Inazawa et al. (1996) localized the PTPN13 gene to 4q21.3 by both
fluorescence in situ hybridization and PCR analysis of somatic cell
hybrids. They noted that the 4q21.3 chromosomal region contains a gene
for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (173910) and is
frequently deleted in liver and ovarian cancers.

The assignment to 4q21 was confirmed by van den Maagdenberg et al.
(1996) who also mapped the gene to mouse chromosome 5.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Wang et al. (2004) performed a mutational analysis of the tyrosine
phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers and identified 83 somatic
mutations in 6 protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRF, 179590; PTPRG,
176886; PTPRT, 608712; PTPN3, 176877; PTPN13; and PTPN14, 603155),
affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung,
breast, and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense,
frameshift, or splice site alterations predicted to result in truncated
proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Wang et al. (2004) biochemically
examined 5 missense mutations in PTPRT, the most commonly altered
protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and found that they reduced phosphatase
activity. Expression of wildtype but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer
cells inhibited cell growth. Wang et al. (2004) concluded that their
observations suggested that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor
suppressor genes, regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to
therapeutic intervention.

612678	TITLE *612678 CUGBP- AND ELAV-LIKE FAMILY, MEMBER 3; CELF3
;;TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEAT-CONTAINING GENE 4; TNRC4;;
BRUNO-LIKE 1; BRUNOL1;;
CUGBP- AND ETR3-LIKE FACTOR 3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the CELF family, such as CELF3, play various roles in
cotranscriptional and posttranscriptional RNA processing. All CELF
proteins appear to affect pre-mRNA splicing, but individual CELFs have
divergent roles in regulating mRNA stability and translation (summary by
Wagnon et al., 2012).

CLONING

By searching databases for human sequences similar to Xenopus Brunol1,
Good et al. (2000) identified a partial sequence for TNRC4, which they
called BRUNOL1. The partial human protein shares 91% amino acid identity
with Xenopus Brunol1.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to CUGBP (601074),
followed by PCR of a human brain cDNA library, Ladd et al. (2001) cloned
TNRC4, which they called CELF3. The deduced 462-amino acid protein
contains 2 N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a C-terminal RRM,
several potential phosphorylation sites, and a nuclear localization
signal near the C terminus. Ladd et al. (2001) also identified a region
of allelic variation in CELF3 in which a variable number of CAG repeats
encode a stretch of glutamines of unfixed length. RNA dot blot analysis
detected CELF3 expression only in brain.

Using RNA dot blot analysis, Ladd et al. (2004) found that CELF3 was
highly expressed in several adult brain regions, in pituitary, and in
fetal brain.

By Western blot analysis of adult human cortex, Chapple et al. (2007)
showed that the full-length 465-amino acid TNRC4 protein had an apparent
molecular mass of about 50 kD. Epitope-tagged TNRC4 was expressed in the
nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells.
Removal of RRM3 led to exclusion of TNRC4 from the nucleus, confirming
the presence of a C-terminal nuclear localization signal.

GENE FUNCTION

Ladd et al. (2001) showed that all human CELF proteins, including CELF3,
bound RNA containing muscle-specific splicing enhancer (MSE) elements
and could activate MSE-dependent exon inclusion of cardiac troponin T
(TNNT2; 191045) minigenes in transfected quail fibroblasts.

By RT-PCR analysis of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, Chapple
et al. (2007) showed that TNRC4 activated inclusion of exon 10 in a tau
(MAPT; 157140) minigene. Deletion and mutation analyses showed that the
activity of TNRC4 on tau exon 10 splicing required RRM2 in TNRC4 and an
intronic element in tau pre-mRNA. The polyglutamine sequence of TNRC4
had no effect on tau exon 10 splicing. Tnrc4 -/- mice exhibited
decreased inclusion of exon 10 in tau mRNA.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Good et al. (2000) mapped the TNRC4 gene
to chromosome 1q21.

171840	TITLE *171840 PHOSPHOFRUCTOKINASE, PLATELET TYPE; PFKP
;;PFK, PLATELET TYPE;;
PFK, FIBROBLAST TYPE; PFKF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PFKP gene encodes the platelet isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFK)
(ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate-1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11). PFK
catalyzes the irreversible conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and is a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis.
The PFKP gene, which maps to chromosome 10p, is also expressed in
fibroblasts. See also the muscle (PFKM; 610681) and liver (PFKL; 171860)
isoforms of phosphofructokinase, which map to chromosomes 12q13 and
21q22, respectively.

Vora (1981) determined that full tetrameric phophofructokinase enzyme
expressed in platelets can be composed of subunits P4, P3L, and P2L2.

CLONING

Simpson and Fothergill-Gilmore (1991) isolated a cDNA corresponding to
the PFKP gene from a human lymphocyte Raji cell line cDNA library using
a cDNA for human muscle PFK as a probe. The deduced amino acid sequence
showed 71% identity to the amino acid sequence for the human muscle
isoenzyme and 63% identity to the human liver isoenzyme.

GENE FUNCTION

Yi et al. (2012) demonstrated that the dynamic posttranslational
modification of proteins by O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine
(O-GlcNAcylation) is a key metabolic regulator of glucose metabolism.
O-GlcNAcylation was induced at ser529 of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) in
response to hypoxia. Glycosylation inhibited PFK1 activity and
redirected glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby
conferring a selective growth advantage on cancer cells. Blocking
glycosylation of PFK1 at ser529 reduced cancer cell proliferation in
vitro and impaired tumor formation in vivo.

MAPPING

Weil et al. (1980) developed a method of specific immunoprecipitation of
human PFK and used it to locate the structural gene for fibroblast PFK
(PFKF) to chromosome 10 in somatic cell hybrids. Vora et al. (1983)
assigned the PFKP gene to 10p by use of a mouse antihuman
P-subunit-specific antiserum in the study of human/rodent somatic cell
hybrids. A single discordant hybrid cell containing only 10q did not
express PFKP, and fibroblasts from a patient with duplication of 10p
exhibited PFK activity values 180% of normal.

Schwartz et al. (1984) confirmed the assignment of PFKP and hexokinase-1
(HK1; 142600) to 10p by dosage effects in a case of 10p partial trisomy.
The synteny of PFKP and HK1 may have functional significance because the
enzymes which they encode are the primary and secondary control points
of the glycolytic pathway.

By use of the cDNA clone as a biotinylated probe for in situ
hybridization to human chromosome spreads, Morrison et al. (1992)
assigned the PFKP gene to chromosome 10p15.3-p15.2.

NOMENCLATURE

Francke (1983) suggested that this form of PFK is best called the
'platelet' type and symbolized PFKP because it is the only form made by
platelets, whereas fibroblasts have more than one form of PFK.

605181	TITLE *605181 TRANSMEMBRANE 7 SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 3; TM7SF3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The superfamily of 7-transmembrane domain proteins, one of the largest
superfamilies of cell surface proteins, includes receptors for a variety
of ligands, such as peptides, hormones, and ions, and for external
sensory stimuli, such as odorants and light. Many 7-transmembrane
molecules are able to recruit small G proteins, suggesting that they can
transduce external signals to the cytoplasm. By sequencing cDNAs
randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from a human colon cancer
cell line, Akashi et al. (2000) identified TM7SF3. The predicted
570-amino acid protein contains 7 putative transmembrane domains, and 5
potential N-glycosylation sites in the N-terminal extracellular region.
Immunocytochemical analysis localized the TM7SF3 protein to the plasma
membrane. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately 2.5-kb TM7SF3
transcript in all human tissues examined, with highest expression in
kidney.

MAPPING

By FISH, Akashi et al. (2000) mapped the TM7SF3 gene to 12q11-q12. Using
radiation hybrid mapping, they localized the TM7SF3 gene between the
markers D12S1596 and D12S333.

subfamily of small proline-rich proteins, including SPRR2A.

GENE FUNCTION

Using DNA microarray analysis, Zimmermann et al. (2005) identified
Sprr2a and Sprr2b (182268) as allergen-induced genes in a mouse model of

601404	TITLE *601404 G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 68; GPR68
;;OVARIAN CANCER G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR 1; OGR1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Xu and Casey (1996) described a gene encoding a member of the G
protein-coupled receptors that they termed ovarian cancer G
protein-coupled receptor-1 (OGR1). It was isolated by degenerate PCR
from an ovarian cell line cDNA library. The 365-amino acid predicted
protein contains 7 hydrophobic transmembrane domains and is 54%
identical to the human orphan receptor GPR4 (600551). Xu and Casey
(1996) detected an approximately 3-kb transcript in a variety of
tissues, including spleen, testis, peripheral blood leukocytes, brain,
lung, and placenta. Its expression was lower in other tissues and
undetectable in some, including ovary.

Ludwig et al. (2003) demonstrated that OGR1, which had previously been
described as a receptor for sphingosylphosphorylcholine, acts as a
proton-sensing receptor stimulating inositol phosphate formation. The
receptor is inactive at pH 7.8 and fully activated at pH 6.8.
Site-directed mutagenesis showed that histidines at the extracellular
surface are involved in pH sensing. These include histidines 17, 20, 84,
269, and 169. Mutation of these amino acids resulted in receptors that
failed to stimulate inositol phosphate formation at pH 6.8 but on
exposure to more acidic pH activity, could be restored. Ludwig et al.
(2003) found that GPR4, a close relative of OGR1, also responds to pH
changes but elicits cAMP formation. They noted that the skeleton
participates in pH homeostasis as a buffering organ and that osteoblasts
respond to pH changes in the physiologic range; their findings suggested
that OGR1 represents an osteoblastic pH sensor regulating cell-mediated
responses to acidosis in bone. They found expression of OGR1 in
osteosarcoma cells and primary human osteoblast precursors, and
demonstrated that these cells exhibit strong pH-dependent inositol
phosphate formation. Immunohistochemistry on rat tissue sections
confirmed the presence of OGR1 in osteoblasts and osteocytes. Ludwig et
al. (2003) proposed that OGR1 and GPR4 are proton-sensing receptors
involved in pH homeostasis.

MAPPING

Xu and Casey (1996) mapped the OGR1 gene to chromosome 14 using a panel
of somatic cell hybrid DNAs and localized it to 14q31 by FISH.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The NTKR1 gene encodes the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase-1 receptor and
belongs to a family of nerve growth factor receptors whose ligands
include neurotrophins. Neurotrophins and their receptors play an
important role in regulating development of both the central and the
peripheral nervous systems. Bothwell (1996), Carter and Lewin (1997),
and Bibel and Barde (2000) reviewed neurotrophins and their receptors.
Nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR; 162010) is also referred to as
p75(NTR) due to its molecular mass and its ability to bind at low
affinity not only NGF (see 162020, 162030), but also other
neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF;
113505), neurotrophin-3 (NTF3; 162660), and neurotrophin-4 (NTF4;
162662). Higher affinity binding of NGFR can achieved by association
with higher molecular mass, low-affinity neurotrophin receptors, namely
the tropomyosin receptor kinases, TRKA (NTRK1), TRKB (NTRK2; 600456),
and TRKC (NTRK3; 191316). TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC are specific for or
'preferred by' NGF, NTF4 and BDNF, and NTF3, respectively (Ip et al.,
1993). NTF3 also binds to TRKA and TRKB, but with significantly lower
affinity.

CLONING

Mardy et al. (1999) reported cloning of the full-length human TRKA gene,
which was predicted to encode a 790- or 796-residue protein with a
single transmembrane domain. The extracellular domain is important for
specific NGF binding and contains 2 immunoglobulin-like domains. The
intracellular domain contains a juxtamembrane region, a tyrosine kinase
domain, and a short C terminal tail.

- NTRK1/TPM3 Fusion Gene

Martin-Zanca et al. (1986, 1986) identified a biologically active cDNA
of a transforming gene in a human colon carcinoma cell line. The gene,
referred to as the TRK protooncogene, is a chimera containing sequences
of both tropomyosin-3 (TPM3; 191030) and a tyrosine kinase. The TRK
protooncogene was predicted to encode a 641-amino acid transmembrane
tyrosine kinase expressed in neural tissues. The protein was identified
by its ability to transform rodent cells in gene transfer assays.
Martin-Zanca et al. (1986) suggested that the chimeric gene was likely
formed by a somatic rearrangement between the 2 genes, resulting in the
replacement of the extracellular domain of a putative transmembrane
receptor with the first 221 amino acids of the tropomyosin-3 molecule.

Mitra et al. (1987) expressed the entire coding sequence of the TRK
oncogene in E. coli. Antisera raised against these bacteria-synthesized
TRK polypeptides were used to identify the gene product of the TRK
oncogene as a 70-kD protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Greco et al. (1996) determined that the human NTRK1 gene contains 17
exons spanning 25 kb of DNA, of which exon 9 is alternatively spliced.
The 5-prime untranslated region lacks a TATA box but has putative
binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 (189906), AP1 (165160),
AP2 (107580), AP3, ATF (123803), and GCF (189901).

MAPPING

Miozzo et al. (1990) mapped the TRK protooncogene to chromosome 1q32-q41
by means of Southern analysis of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell
hybrids and subsequent in situ hybridization of human metaphase
chromosomes. Morris et al. (1991) localized the TRK oncogene to a more
proximal location, 1q23-q24, by in situ hybridization.

By use of computer-assisted microscopy and a method of fluorescence in
situ hybridization involving selection of human genomic P1 clones with
large DNA inserts, Weier et al. (1995) mapped the NTRK1 gene to
1q21-q22.

GENE FUNCTION

Hempstead et al. (1991) found that high affinity binding of NGF required
coexpression of the TRK gene and the low-affinity NGF receptor. NGF
stimulated phosphorylation of the TRK protein in neural cell lines and
in embryonic dorsal root ganglia. Kaplan et al. (1991) likewise
identified the TRK gene product as an NGF receptor, thus indicating that
the protein participates in the primary signal transduction mechanism of
NGF. Loeb et al. (1991) presented results indicating that TRK was
necessary for functional nerve growth factor signal transduction.
Cordon-Cardo et al. (1991) presented evidence that the product of the
TRK protooncogene was sufficient to mediate signal transduction
processes induced by nerve growth factor and neurotrophin-3. Ehrhard et
al. (1993) reported that TRK is expressed in monocytes; this finding as
well as others suggested that nerve growth factor is an immunoregulatory
cytokine acting on monocytes in addition to its neurotrophic function.

Chuang et al. (2001) demonstrated that bradykinin- or NGF-mediated
potentiation of thermal sensitivity in vivo required expression of VR1
(602076), a heat-activated ion channel on sensory neurons. Diminution of
plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,5,bisphosphate levels through
antibody sequestration or PLC-mediated hydrolysis mimicked the
potentiating effects of bradykinin or NGF at the cellular level.
Moreover, recruitment of PLC-gamma (172420) to TRK-alpha was essential
for NGF-mediated potentiation of channel activity, and biochemical
studies suggested that VR1 associates with this complex. Chuang et al.
(2001) concluded that their studies delineated a biochemical mechanism
through which bradykinin and NGF produce hypersensitivity and might
explain how the activation of PLC signaling systems regulates other
members of the TRP channel family.

Kuruvilla et al. (2004) found that the related neurotrophins NGF and
NT3, acting through a common TRKA receptor, were required for sequential
stages of sympathetic axon growth and innervation of target fields. Yet,
whereas NGF supported TRKA internalization and retrograde signaling from
distal axons to cell bodies to promote neuronal survival, NT3 could not.
Final target-derived NGF promoted expression of the p75 neurotrophin
receptor, in turn causing a reduction in the sensitivity of axons to
intermediate target-derived NT3. Kuruvilla et al. (2004) proposed that a
hierarchical neurotrophin signaling cascade coordinates sequential
stages of sympathetic axon growth, innervation of targets, and survival
in a manner dependent on the differential control of TRKA
internalization, trafficking, and retrograde axonal signaling.

Neurotrophins (NTFs) act as survival and differentiation factors in the
nervous system and have been detected in the developing rodent testis.
To determine whether neurotrophins could influence development and
maturation of the human fetal testis, Robinson et al. (2003) examined
the cell-specific expression and distribution of several members of the
neurotrophin family and their receptors during the second trimester,
with particular emphasis on NT4 and TRKB. They detected expression of
mRNA for nerve growth factor (NGF; 162030), NTF3 (162660) and NTF4
(162662), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505), the
high-affinity receptors TRKA, TRKB (600456), and TRKC (191316), and the
low-affinity p75 receptor NGFR in the human testis between 14 and 19
weeks' gestation. NT4 mRNA and protein were predominantly localized to
the peritubular cells. These cells were also the site of expression of
p75. By contrast, NGF and NT3 were mainly expressed in Sertoli and
interstitial cells. The authors concluded that these data demonstrate
the expression of neurotrophins and their receptors in the human fetal
testis during the second trimester and indicate possible roles in the
regulation of proliferation and survival of germ cells and peritubular
cells.

Cholinergic projection neurons of the basal forebrain nucleus basalis
(NB) express NGF receptors p75(NTR) and TrkA, which promote cell
survival. These same cells undergo extensive degeneration in Alzheimer
disease (AD; 104300). Counts et al. (2004) found an approximately 50%
average reduction in TrkA levels in 4 cortical brain regions of 15
patients with AD, compared to 18 individuals with no cognitive
impairment (NCI) and 16 with mild/moderate cognitive impairment (MCI).
By contrast, cortical p75(NTR) levels were stable across the diagnostic
groups. Scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) correlated
with TrkA levels in the anterior cingulate, superior frontal, and
superior temporal cortices. Counts et al. (2004) suggested that reduced
TrkA levels may be the cause or result of abnormal NB cholinergic
function in AD.

The AML1 (RUNX1; 151385)/ETO (CBFA2T1; 133435) fusion protein results
from a t(8;21) chromosomal translocation and is a potent transcriptional
modulator associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 601626). Mulloy
et al. (2005) transduced CD34 (142230)-positive cells with a retrovirus
carrying the AML1/ETO fusion transcript and found that AML1/ETO
expression upregulated NTRK1. Physiologic concentrations of NGF
increased the proliferation of AML1/ETO-transduced cells. Furthermore,
NGF and IL3 (147740) synergistically promoted the expansion of
ALM1/ETO-expressing cells, but not control CD34-positive cells, in
liquid culture. Mulloy et al. (2005) examined a large number of AML bone
marrow or peripheral blood samples and found those containing the
t(8;21) translocation expressed significantly higher levels of NTRK1
mRNA than samples without the translocation. They concluded that the
NGF/NTRK1 signaling pathway may be involved in the development of AML.

Keratoconus is a common corneal dystrophy that leads to severe visual
impairment. Since NGF is involved in trophism and corneal wound healing,
Lambiase et al. (2005) investigated alterations in the NGF pathway in
keratoconus-affected corneas and found a total absence of TRKA
expression and decreased expression of NGF and p75(NTR). The absence of
TRKA expression was associated with a strong increase in expression of
the short isoforms of SP3 (601804), which is involved in gene
repression, and lack of the long SP3 isoform, which is involved in gene
activation. Furthermore, expression of short SP3 isoforms in human
corneal keratocyte primary cultures resulted in downregulation of TRKA
expression. Lambiase et al. (2005) hypothesized that an imbalance in SP
transcription factor isoforms may play a role in controlling NGF
signaling, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of keratoconus.

Mutoh et al. (2005) reported an 86-year-old Japanese man with a history
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma who developed sensory axonal neuropathy and
autonomic dysfunction. Detailed laboratory investigations identified a
paraneoplastic autoantibody to Trk. Serum from the patient inhibited
NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and Trk autophosphorylation in rat
pheochromocytoma cells, suggesting that the autoantibody was responsible
for the clinical symptoms. Treatment with intravenous human
immunoglobulin resulted in clinical improvement.

Deppmann et al. (2008) reported that developmental competition between
sympathetic neurons for survival is critically dependent on a
sensitization process initiated by target innervation and mediated by a
series of feedback loops. Target-derived NGF (see 162020) promoted
expression of its own receptor TrkA in mouse and rat neurons and
prolonged TrkA-mediated signals. NGF also controlled expression of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 113505) and neurotrophin-4
(NT4; 162662), which, through the receptor p75, can kill neighboring
neurons with low retrograde NGF-TrkA signaling, whereas neurons with
high NGF-TrkA signaling are protected. Perturbation of any of these
feedback loops disrupts the dynamics of competition. Deppmann et al.
(2008) suggested that 3 target-initiated events are essential for rapid
and robust competition between neurons: sensitization, paracrine
apoptotic signaling, and protection from such effects.

- NTRK1/TPM3 Fusion Gene

Coulier et al. (1989) found that the only change leading to the
transforming capacity of the TRK oncogene was replacement of the
extracellular domain of NTRK1 by sequences coding for the 221
amino-terminal residues of TPM3.

By transfection assay, Bongarzone et al. (1989) found that the TRK
oncogene was activated in tumor cells, both primary tumor and/or
metastasis, in 4 of 16 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma
(188550).

Chromosomal rearrangements are responsible for the generation of 2
different oncogenes in papillary thyroid carcinoma: RET/PTC (164761) and
NTRK1/TPM3 (TRK). Both of these oncogenes result from the fusion of the
tyrosine kinase domain of a membrane receptor protein (RET and NTRK1,
respectively) with 5-prime unrelated sequences, yielding chimeric
proteins with ectopic, constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Greco et
al. (1993) established that the oncogenic rearrangement of the NTRK1
gene detected in thyroid tumors involved 3 different genes: the TPM3
gene was fused to the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain in 3 cases; the TPR
gene (189940) was involved in 3 cases; and the TAG gene (TFG; 602498)
was involved in the rearrangement in 1 case. Greco et al. (1993) found
that the rearrangements creating all the TRK oncogenes fell within a
2.9-kb XbaI/SmaI restriction fragment of the NTRK1 gene.

In 3 of 8 papillary thyroid carcinomas, Butti et al. (1995) found that
replacement of the extracellular domain of the NTRK1 gene by sequences
coding for the 221 amino-terminal residues of the TPM3 gene was
responsible for the oncogenic NTRK1 activation. In all of them, the
illegitimate recombination involved the 611-bp NTRK1 intron placed
upstream of the transmembrane domain and the TPM3 intron located between
exons 7 and 8. Therefore, due to the displacing mechanism, all of the
TPM3/NTRK1 gene fusions encoded an invariable transcript and the same
chimeric protein of 70 kD, which was constitutively phosphorylated on
tyrosine. In 2 of the 3 tumors, the simultaneous presence of the
reciprocal products of the TPM3/NTRK1 recombination (5-prime
TPM3/3-prime NTRK1 and 5-prime NTRK1/3-prime TPM3) and the previously
demonstrated localization of both genes on 1q led Butti et al. (1995) to
suggest that an intrachromosomal inversion was responsible for their
recombination. In these recombinant regions, they found some
recombinogenic elements as well as palindromes, direct and inverted
repeats, and Alu family sequences.

Using 3-dimensional structural analysis and a protein-protein
interaction system, Wehrman et al. (2007) found no evidence of TRKA and
p75 heterodimerization. Instead, TRKA formed a crab-shaped homodimer
after interaction with NGF, and p75 existed on the cell surface as a
preformed oligomer that was not dissociated by NGF. Wehrman et al.
(2007) proposed that TRKA and NGFR do not interact directly, but that
they likely communicate through convergence of downstream signaling
pathways and/or shared adaptor molecules.

Using engineered embryonic stem cells, Nikoletopoulou et al. (2010)
demonstrated that the neurotrophin receptors TRKA and TRKC (191316)
instruct developing neurons to die, both in vitro and in vivo. By
contrast, TRKB (600456), a closely related receptor primarily expressed
in the central nervous system, does not. These results indicated that
TRKA and TRKC behave as dependence receptors, explaining why developing
sympathetic and sensory neurons become trophic factor-dependent for
survival. Nikoletopoulou et al. (2010) suggested that the expansion of
the TRK gene family that accompanied the segregation of the peripheral
from the central nervous system generated a novel mechanism of cell
number control.

- NTRK1/TFG Fusion Gene

In one papillary thyroid carcinoma tumor, Greco et al. (1995) found a
chimeric oncogene, which they designated TRKT3, in which 1,412
nucleotides of NTRK1 were fused to 598 nucleotides from the TRK-fused
gene (TFG; 602498). Greco et al. (1995) determined that the TRKT3 gene
encodes a predicted 592-amino acid chimeric protein that forms
multimeric complexes in vivo.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 7 families with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis
(CIPA; 256800), Mardy et al. (1999) identified 11 novel mutations of the
TRKA gene: 6 missense mutations, 2 frameshift mutations, 1 nonsense
mutation, and 2 splice site mutations. Mendelian inheritance of the
mutations in this autosomal recessive disorder was confirmed in 6
families for which parent samples were available. The mutations were
distributed in an extracellular domain, involved in nerve growth factor
binding, as well as the intracellular signal transduction domain. Two
mutations were linked (on the same chromosome) to arg85 to ser
(191315.0006) and to his598 to tyr;gly607 to val (191315.0005); hence,
they probably represented double and triple mutations. Triple mutation
is rare and has been reported in Gaucher disease; see 230800.0009.
Double mutations have been reported more often, e.g., in the HEXA gene
causing Tay-Sachs disease (272800.0036), and in the LDLR gene causing
familial hypercholesterolemia (143890.0055).

Miura et al. (2000) studied the NTRK1 gene in 46 CIPA chromosomes
derived from 23 unrelated Japanese CIPA families, including 3 that had
previously been reported, and identified 11 novel mutations. Four were
missense mutations that resulted in amino acid substitutions at
positions conserved in the TRK family. Three frameshift and 3 nonsense
mutations were found. One was an intronic branch-site mutation
(191315.0007), causing aberrant splicing in vitro.

Shatzky et al. (2000) identified 2 novel mutations in the NTRK1 gene in
consanguineous Israeli-Bedouins with CIPA: a 1926insT (191315.0010) in
most of the patients of the southern Israeli-Negev, and a pro689-to-leu
mutation (191315.0011) in a different Bedouin isolate in northern
Israel.

Miura et al. (2000) reported the second case of paternal uniparental
disomy (UPD) for chromosome 1 in a male patient with congenital
insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis, who developed normally at term
and did not show overt dysmorphisms or malformations. He had only the
usual features of CIPA with a homozygous mutation (1726delC;
191315.0001) at the TRKA locus and a normal karyotype with no visible
deletions or evidence of monosomy 1. Haplotype analysis of the TRKA
locus and allelotype analyses of whole chromosome 1 revealed that the
chromosome pair was exclusively derived from his father. Nonmaternity
was excluded by analyses of autosomes other than chromosome 1. The
findings further supported the idea that there are no paternally
imprinted genes on chromosome 1 with a major effect on phenotype.

Mardy et al. (2001) introduced various CIPA-causing mutations into TRKA
cDNA and examined NGF-stimulated autophosphorylation in neuronal and
nonneuronal cells. Two mutations in the extracellular domain were
aberrantly processed and showed diminished autophosphorylation in
neuronal cells. Five mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain, including
gly571 to arg (191315.0003), were processed as wildtype TRKA but showed
significantly diminished autophosphorylation in both neuronal and
nonneuronal cells. In contrast, arg85 to ser (191315.0006) and his598 to
tyr; gly607 to val (191315.0005), detected previously as double and
triple mutations, are possibly polymorphisms in a particular ethnic
background.

Indo (2001) reviewed mutations and polymorphisms in the NTRK1 gene.
Thirty-seven different mutations had been identified.

Indo et al. (2001) reported 8 novel mutations in the TRKA gene in
patients with CIPA, detected in either homozygous or heterozygous state
in 9 families from 5 countries. In 1 family, paternal uniparental disomy
for chromosome 1 was thought to be the cause of reduction to
homozygosity of the TRKA gene mutation. A Hispanic patient from the
United States had 2 autosomal genetic disorders, CIPA and pyruvate
kinase (PK) deficiency (266200), whose genetic loci map to a closely
linked chromosomal region. A splice mutation and a missense mutation
were detected in the TRKA and PKLR (609712) genes, respectively, from
the homozygous proband. Thus, concordant occurrence of 2 disorders was
ascribed to a combination of 2 separate mutant genes, not to a
contiguous gene syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Smeyne et al. (1994) found that mice lacking the gene for Trka shared
dramatic features of congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis
(CIPA; 256800), including loss of responses to painful stimuli, although
anhidrosis is not apparent in the animals. This prompted Indo et al.
(1996) to consider the human TRKA homolog as a candidate for the CIPA
gene. In 3 unrelated CIPA patients who had consanguineous parents, they
detected a deletion (191315.0001), a splice site aberration
(191315.0002), and a missense mutation (191315.0003) in the tyrosine
kinase domain of the TRKA gene. The findings suggested to Indo et al.
(1996) that the NGF-TRKA system has a crucial role in the development
and function of the nociceptive reception system as well as
establishment of thermoregulation via sweating in humans.

Ugolini et al. (2007) found that MNAC13, an anti-TrkA antibody with
known neutralizing properties, induced analgesia in mouse models of both
acute inflammatory and chronic neuropathic pain. Treatment with MNAC13
resulted in a long-lasting effect in the neuropathic model and resulted
in significant functional recovery in mice with sciatic nerve ligation.
Moreover, treatment with MNAC13 potentiated the analgesic effects of
subthreshold doses of opiates.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, 1-BP DEL, 1726C

In a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain (256800), Indo et al.
(1996) found deletion of a single base C at nucleotide 1726 in exon C of
the NTRK1 gene. The deletion occurred in a region encoding the tyrosine
kinase domain, causing a frameshift and premature termination codons
downstream. The proband and her parents were homozygous and heterozygous
for the deletion, respectively. In a note added in proof, Indo et al.
(1996) indicated that they had discovered another patient homozygous for
the same single-base deletion in exon C.

Miura et al. (2000) found that the 1726delC mutation was present in 20
of 40 CIPA chromosomes studied. In 6 families, the mutation was
homozygous in affected individuals; in 8 families it was heterozygous.

The 1726delC mutation causes a frameshift and premature termination
codon after amino acid arg548 in exon 14. In the case of paternal
uniparental isodisomy for chromosome 1 reported by Miura et al. (2000),
the father was heterozygous for the mutation, and the mother was
homozygous for the wildtype allele. The mutation was on the chromosome 1
derived from the paternal grandmother. Neither maternal grandparent
carried the mutation.

INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, IVSDS, A-C, +3

In 2 Ecuadorian brothers with congenital insensitivity to pain with
anhidrosis (GM08382 and GM08383) (256800), Indo et al. (1996) found a
deletion of exon D (nucleotides 1872-2112) on 1 allele of the NTRK1
gene. Part of the same exon (nucleotides 1966-2112) was deleted on the
other allele, indicating the presence of RNA splicing errors. The
partial exon deletion was apparently due to activation of a cryptic
splice donor site. Sequencing of genomic DNA revealed that the 5-prime
splice site of an intron between exons D and E contained an A-to-C
transversion in the third position. Such mutations are known to result
in skipping of the preceding exon. No substitution was found in exon D
and the flanking exon/intron junctions. Restriction digestion analysis
demonstrated that GM08382 and GM08383 (identification numbers for cell
lines in the NIGMS cell bank) were homozygous for the A-to-C
transversion and that the parents were heterozygous.

.0003
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, GLY571ARG

In a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain and anhidrosis
(256800), Indo et al. (1996) found a G-to-C transversion at nucleotide
1795 in exon C which caused a gly571-to-arg substitution. The patient
and parents were homozygous and heterozygous for this mutation,
respectively. The investigators noted that gly571 is located in the
tyrosine kinase domain and is conserved among 14 receptor tyrosine
kinases, including human TRKB (600456) and TRKC (191316), suggesting
that it is important for enzyme activity.

INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, ARG774PRO

In an Italian patient with congenital insensitivity to pain and
anhidrosis (256800), Greco et al. (1999) identified homozygosity for a
G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 2405 in exon 17, predicting an
arg774-to-pro substitution. Other members of the family were
heterozygous; indeed, the arg774-to-pro mutation was present in both
maternal grandparents, who had no documented consanguinity but were from
the same village. Biologic and biochemical studies were consistent with
a loss-of-function effect.

.0005
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, GLN9TER, HIS598TYR, AND GLY607VAL

In an Italian patient with congenital insensitivity to pain with
anhidrosis (256800), Mardy et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a triple
mutation in exons 1 and 15 in the NTRK1 gene, leading to 1 nonsense
mutation (gln9 to ter) and 2 missense mutations (his598 to tyr; gly607
to val). Mardy et al. (1999) suggested that the gln9-to-ter mutation was
the most likely cause of CIPA in this family. The missense mutations
were later determined to have no effect on autophosphorylation of NTRK1
(Mardy et al., 2001), and are thus likely to be polymorphisms in this
population.

.0006
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, IVS4, G-C, -1 AND ARG85SER

In a male patient with CIPA (256800) from the United Arab Emirates,
Mardy et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a double mutation in the
NTRK1 gene: a G-to-C transversion in the first position of exon 4
(IVS4-1G-C), and a C-to-A transversion at nucleotide 337 in exon 2
causing an arg85-to-ser substitution. The latter mutation was later
determined to have no effect on autophosphorylation of NTRK1 (Mardy et
al., 2001), and is thus likely to be a polymorphism in this population.

.0007
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, IVS7AS, T-A, -33

In a Japanese patient with CIPA (256800), Miura et al. (2000) identified
an intronic branch-site mutation, IVS7AS-33 T-A, causing aberrant
splicing in vitro.

THYROID CARCINOMA, FAMILIAL MEDULLARY
NTRK1, TYR604HIS

By SSCP analysis of 31 sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (155240),
Gimm et al. (1999) detected variants in 5 exons (exons 4 and 14-17) of
the NTRK1 gene. All variants were also present in the corresponding
germline DNA. Interestingly, the sequence variants at codon 604 (C1810T,
tyr to his) and codon 613 (G1838T, val to gly) of exon 15 always
occurred together, possibly representing linkage disequilibrium.

NTRK1, 1-BP INS, 1926T

In patients with congenital insensitivity to pain (256800) from 16
Bedouin families from the southern Israeli-Negev, Shatzky et al. (2000)
identified a 1-bp insertion in the NTRK1 gene. The mutation was used for
prenatal diagnosis in 6 cases.

NTRK1, PRO689LEU

In CIPA (256800) patients from an isolate of Bedouins in northern
Israel, Shatzky et al. (2000) identified a pro689-to-leu mutation in the
NTRK1 gene.

.0012
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, TYR359CYS

Houlden et al. (2001) described a boy, from a consanguineous Pakistani
family, with recurrent pyrexial episodes from early life who sustained a
painless ankle injury and was found to have a calcaneus fracture and,
later, neuropathic joint degeneration of the tarsus. Examination
revealed distal loss of pain and temperature sensation and widespread
anhidrosis. Sural nerve biopsy demonstrated severe reduction in
small-caliber myelinated fiber density but only modest reduction in
unmyelinated axons. Houlden et al. (2001) concluded that the pathologic
findings were most consistent with hereditary sensory and autonomic
neuropathy type V (HSAN5; 608654); HSAN V is distinguished from the
usual congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA or HSAN4;
256800) by the selective loss of small myelinated fibers (Low et al.,
1978; Donaghy et al., 1987). Because the Pakistani patient was
homozygous for a tyr359-to-cys missense mutation in exon 8 of the NTRK1
gene, Houlden et al. (2001) concluded that HSAN IV and V are not
distinct disorders but different manifestations of mutations in the
NTRK1 gene.

Toscano et al. (2002) suggested that the patient reported by Houlden et
al. (2001) had HSAN4, not HSAN5, and noted that Houlden et al. (2001)
had based their diagnosis mainly on the pathologic findings.

.0013
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, MET581VAL

In a large family with CIPA (256800) with many consanguineous marriages
from a small remote island in the southern part of Japan, Yotsumoto et
al. (1999) reported a met581-to-val (M581V) mutation, occurring within
subdomain V (beta-5 strand) of the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. The
amino acid substitution resulted from an A-to-G transition at nucleotide
1825 in exon 14 of the NTRK1 gene. The 3 affected individuals were
adults and displayed milder clinical symptoms compared with other CIPA
patients, including normal temperature sensation and a relatively long
survival. Two patients were homozygous for the M581V mutation. Miranda
et al. (2002) demonstrated that the M581V mutation causes a reduction of
activity of the NTRK1 receptor in transfected COS-1 and NIH 3T3 cells.

.0014
INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN, CONGENITAL, WITH ANHIDROSIS
NTRK1, 2-BP DEL, 207TG

In 2 sibs with CIPA (256800), whose unrelated Israeli parents were of
Moroccan Jewish descent, Suriu et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
2-bp deletion (207delTG) in exon 1 of the NTRK1 gene, resulting in a
frameshift and premature termination at codon 86. Each unaffected parent
was heterozygous for the mutation. This mutation was identified in the
heterozygous state in a carrier from a second unrelated family of
Moroccan Jewish origin in which 2 individuals had CIPA and died. The
mutation was not found in 600 control chromosomes. Haplotype analysis
indicated shared markers surrounding the mutant allele. Both families
originated from Skoura, a small oasis village along the Valley of a
Thousand Kasbahs in southern Morocco. Most members of the Jewish
families residing there had immigrated to Israel in the 1950s. The
common ancestry suggested that 207delTG may be a founder mutation.

614282	TITLE *614282 STROMAL CELL-DERIVED FACTOR 4; SDF4
;;CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN, 45-KD; CAB45
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Scherer et al. (1996) cloned 2 splice variants of mouse Sdf4, which they
called Cab45. The transcripts differ in their 5-prime UTRs and encode
the same 361-amino acid protein. Cab45 has an N-terminal signal
sequence, followed by an N-glycosylation site and 6 EF hands
characteristic of calcium-binding proteins. Cab45 shares significant
sequence similarity with the endoplasmic reticulum-resident
calcium-binding proteins reticulocalbin (RCN1; 602735) and Erc55 (RCN2;
602584). Northern blot analysis detected variable Cab45 expression in
all mouse tissues examined. Pulse-chase, endoglycosidase H resistance,
and brefeldin-A experiments and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed
that Cab45 was a glycosylated, soluble, postmedial Golgi-resident
protein.

Koivu et al. (1997) cloned human CAB45 from a lymphocyte cDNA library.
The deduced 362-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of
41.8 kD and shares 87% identity with mouse Cab45. Northern blot analysis
detected variable CAB45 expression in all 8 human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an overlay assay, Scherer et al. (1996) found that mouse Cab45
showed significant binding of radiolabeled calcium.

Zhu et al. (2008) showed that expression of Cab45 was downregulated
during differentiation in cultured rat PC12 cells and rat cerebellum.
Cab45 expression was also downregulated by ethanol in mouse fibroblasts.
Knockdown of Cab45 in PC12 cells exacerbated the antiproliferative
effect of ultraviolet exposure.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the SDF4 gene to chromosome 1p36.33 based on an
alignment of the SDF4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF153686) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

102578	TITLE *102578 ACUTE PROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA, INDUCER OF; PML
;;MYL
PML/RARA FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PML tumor suppressor protein is essential for the formation of a
dynamic macromolecular nuclear structure called the PML-nuclear body
(PML-NB). PML-NBs have also been referred to as nuclear domains-10,
Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. Unlike more specialized
subnuclear structures, PML-NBs are involved in diverse cellular
functions, including sequestration and release of proteins, mediation of
posttranslational modifications, and promotion of nuclear events in
response to various cellular stresses. The PML gene is involved in the
t(15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376),
which generates the oncogenic fusion protein PML-retinoic acid
receptor-alpha (RARA; 180240). PML-NBs are disrupted in APL and are thus
implicated in APL pathogenesis (Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007; Salomoni et
al., 2008).

CLONING

In the process of analyzing the RARA gene in the t(15;17)(q22;q11.2-q12)
translocation specifically associated with APL, de The et al. (1990)
identified a novel gene on chromosome 15 involved with the RARA gene in
formation of a fusion product. This gene, which they called MYL for
'myelocytic leukemia,' was transcribed in the same direction as RARA on
the translocated chromosome. De The et al. (1990) identified a 144-bp
region, flanked by canonical splice acceptor and donor sequences, that
had a high probability of being an exon and showed no significant
similarity to any sequence in a protein data bank, thus suggesting that
MYL is a previously undescribed gene. In a later report, de The et al.
(1991) changed the name of the gene from MYL to PML. They reported,
furthermore, that the gene product contains a novel zinc finger motif
common to several DNA-binding proteins.

Goddard et al. (1991) demonstrated that PML is a putative zinc finger
protein and potential transcription factor that is commonly expressed,
with at least 3 major transcription products.

Goddard et al. (1995) cloned the murine Pml gene. The predicted amino
acid sequence of mouse Pml, a ring-finger protein, shows 80% similarity
to that of the human homolog, with greater than 90% similarity in the
proposed functional domains.

MAPPING

The PML gene maps to chromosome 15q22 (de The et al., 1990).

Goddard et al. (1995) mapped the mouse Pml gene to a region of
chromosome 9 with known homology of synteny to the region of 15q where
PML is located.

GENE FUNCTION

While PML does not colocalize with proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA; 176740) or spliceosomes, Dyck et al. (1994) showed that it is
part of a macromolecular structure, composed of at least 4 nuclear
proteins, that is adhered to the nuclear matrix. This structure shows a
labeling pattern resembling spheres that vary in both size and number
among individual cells of a given cell line. PML-RAR expression appears
to disrupt the integrity of these structures (referred to by Dyck et al.
(1994) as PML oncogenic domains, or PODs) and thus appears to be the
possible cause of their altered morphology. Retinoid treatment leads to
a striking reassembly of the POD, which in turn is linked to
differentiation of the leukemic cells. These results identified a novel
macromolecular nuclear structure and suggested that it may serve as a
target of cellular transformation.

From their analysis of the phosphoamino acids of the PML protein, Chang
et al. (1995) concluded that both tyrosine and serine residues are
phosphorylated. To investigate whether expression of the PML protein is
cell cycle related, HeLa cells synchronized at various phases of the
cell cycle were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and confocal
microscopy. They found that PML was expressed at a lower level in S, G2,
and M phases and at a significantly higher level in G1 phase. Other
studies showed that PML is a phosphoprotein and is associated with the
nuclear matrix. Chang et al. (1995) noted that PML shares many
properties with tumor suppressors such as RB (614041).

Fusion of PML and TIF1A (603406) to RARA and BRAF (164757),
respectively, results in the production of PML-RAR-alpha and
TIF1-alpha-B-RAF (T18) oncoproteins. Zhong et al. (1999) showed that
PML, TIF1-alpha, and RXR-alpha (180245)/RAR-alpha function together in a
retinoic acid-dependent transcription complex. Zhong et al. (1999) found
that PML acts as a ligand-dependent coactivator of RXR-alpha/RARA-alpha.
PML interacts with TIF1-alpha and CREB-binding protein (CBP; 600140). In
PML -/- cells, the retinoic acid-dependent induction of genes such as
RARB2, and the ability of TIF1-alpha and CBP to act as transcriptional
coactivators on retinoic acid, are impaired. Zhong et al. (1999) showed
that both PML and TIF1-alpha are growth suppressors required for the
growth-inhibitory activity of retinoic acid. T18, similar to
PML-RAR-alpha, disrupts the retinoic acid-dependent activity of this
complex in a dominant-negative manner, resulting in a growth advantage.
PML-RAR-alpha was the first example of an oncoprotein generated by the
fusion of 2 molecules participating in the same pathway, specifically
the fusion of a transcription factor to one of its own cofactors. Since
the PML and RAR-alpha pathways converge at the transcriptional level,
there is no need for a double-dominant-negative product to explain the
pathogenesis of APL.

Pearson et al. (2000) reported that the tumor suppressor PML regulates
the p53 response to oncogenic signals. Pearson et al. (2000) found that
oncogenic RAS (190020) upregulates PML expression, and that
overexpression of PML induces senescence in a p53-dependent manner. p53
is acetylated at lysine-382 upon RAS expression, an event that is
essential for its biologic function. RAS induces relocalization of p53
and the CBP acetyltransferase within the PML nuclear bodies and induces
the formation of a trimeric p53-PML-CBP complex. Lastly, RAS-induced p53
acetylation, p53-CBP complex stabilization, and senescence are lost in
PML -/- fibroblasts. Pearson et al. (2000) concluded that their data
established a link between PML and p53 and indicated that integrity of
the PML bodies is required for p53 acetylation and senescence upon
oncogene expression.

Khan et al. (2001) showed that PML interacts with multiple corepressors
(SKI (164780), NCOR, and Sin3A (607776)) and histone deacetylase-1
(HDAC1; 601241), and that this interaction is required for
transcriptional repression mediated by the tumor suppressor MAD
(600021). PML-RARA has the 2 corepressor-interacting sites and inhibits
MAD-mediated repression, suggesting that aberrant binding of PML-RARA to
the corepressor complexes may lead to abrogation of the corepressor
function. The authors suggested that these mechanisms may contribute to
events leading to leukemogenesis.

Turelli et al. (2001) showed that incoming retroviral preintegration
complexes trigger the exportin (602559)-mediated cytoplasmic export of
the SWI/SNF component INI1 (601607) and of the nuclear body constituent
PML. They further showed that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
genome associates with these proteins before nuclear migration. In the
presence of arsenic, PML was sequestered in the nucleus, and the
efficiency of HIV-mediated transduction was markedly increased. These
results unveiled an unsuspected cellular response that interferes with
the early steps of HIV replication.

Yang et al. (2002) determined that PML and checkpoint kinase-2 (CHEK2;
604373) mediated p53 (191170)-independent apoptosis following gamma
irradiation of several human cell lines. Endogenous CHEK2 bound PML
within PML nuclear bodies. Following gamma irradiation, CHEK2
phosphorylated PML on ser117, causing dissociation of the 2 proteins.
Apoptosis through this mechanism also required ATM (208900). Yang et al.
(2002) concluded that this pathway to gamma irradiation-induced
apoptosis utilizes ATM, CHEK2, and PML. Overexpression of PML alone
caused apoptosis in U937 myeloid cells.

Lin et al. (2004) demonstrated that cytoplasmic PML is an essential
modulator of TGF-beta signaling. Primary cells from Pml-null mice are
resistant to TGF-beta-dependent growth arrest, induction of cellular
senescence, and apoptosis. These cells also have impaired
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the TGF-beta signaling
proteins Smad2 (601366) and Smad3 (603109), as well as impaired
induction of TGF-beta target genes. Expression of cytoplasmic Pml is
induced by TGF-beta. Furthermore, cytoplasmic Pml physically interacts
with Smad2, Smad3, and SMAD anchor for receptor activation (SARA;
603755), and is required for association of Smad2 and Smad3 with Sara
and for the accumulation of Sara and TGF-beta receptor (see 190181) in
the early endosome. The PML-RAR-alpha oncoprotein of acute promyelocytic
leukemia can antagonize cytoplasmic PML function, and acute
promyelocytic leukemia cells have defects in TGF-beta signaling similar
to those observed in Pml-null cells. Lin et al. (2004) concluded that
their findings identified cytoplasmic PML as a critical TGF-beta
receptor and further implicated deregulated TGF-beta signaling in cancer
pathogenesis.

Trotman et al. (2006) demonstrated that the PML tumor suppressor
prevents cancer by inactivating phosphorylated AKT (164730) inside the
nucleus. They found in a mouse model that Pml loss markedly accelerated
tumor onset, incidence, and progression in Pten (601728) heterozygous
mutants, and led to female sterility with features that recapitulate the
phenotype of Foxo3a knockout mice. Trotman et al. (2006) showed that PML
deficiency on its own leads to tumorigenesis in the prostate, a tissue
that is exquisitely sensitive to phosphorylated AKT levels, and
demonstrated that PML specifically recruits the AKT phosphatase PP2a
(see 603113) as well phosphorylated AKT into PML nuclear bodies.
Notably, Trotman et al. (2006) found that PML-null cells are impaired in
PP2a phosphatase activity towards AKT, and thus accumulate nuclear
phosphorylated AKT. As a consequence, the progressive reduction in PML
dose leads to inactivation of FOXO3A-mediated transcription of
proapoptotic BIM (603827) and the cell cycle inhibitor p27(KIP1)
(600778). Trotman et al. (2006) concluded that their results demonstrate
that PML orchestrates a nuclear tumor suppressor network for
inactivation of nuclear phosphorylated AKT, and thus highlight the
importance of AKT compartmentalization in human cancer pathogenesis and
treatment.

Bernardi et al. (2006) identified PML as a critical inhibitor of
neoangiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) in vivo, in both
ischemic and neoplastic conditions, through the control of protein
translation. Bernardi et al. (2006) demonstrated that in hypoxic
conditions PML acts as a negative regulator of the synthesis rate of
hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A; 603348) by repressing MTOR
(601231). PML physically interacts with MTOR and negatively regulates
its association with the small GTPase RHEB (601293) by favoring MTOR
nuclear accumulation. Notably, PML-null cells and tumors display higher
sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo to growth inhibition by rapamycin,
and lack of PML inversely correlates with phosphorylation of ribosomal
protein S6 (180460) and tumor angiogenesis in mouse and human tumors.
Thus, Bernardi et al. (2006) concluded that their findings identified
PML as a novel suppressor of mTOR and neoangiogenesis.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human fetal brain cDNA library, followed
by coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Kunapuli et al. (2006) found that
ZNF198 (ZMYM2; 602221) was covalently modified by SUMO1 (601912).
Confocal microscopy showed that a proportion of ZNF198 colocalized with
SUMO1 and PML in PML nuclear bodies, and coimmunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that all 3 proteins resided in a protein complex. Mutation of
the SUMO1-binding site of ZNF198 resulted in degradation of ZNF198,
nuclear dispersal of PML, and loss of punctate PML nuclear bodies.
Kunapuli et al. (2006) found that the MDA-MB-157 breast cancer cell
line, which has a deletion in chromosome 13q11 encompassing the ZNF198
gene, lacked PML nuclear bodies, although PML protein levels appeared
normal. The fusion protein ZNF198/FGFR1 (136350), which occurs in
atypical myeloproliferative disease (613523) and lacks the SUMO1-binding
site of ZNF198, could dimerize with wildtype ZNF198 and disrupt its
function. Expression of ZNF198/FGFR1 disrupted PML sumoylation and
nuclear body formation and resulted in cytoplasmic localization of
SUMO1. Kunapuli et al. (2006) concluded that sumoylation of ZNF198 is
required for PML nuclear body formation.

Ito et al. (2008) showed that PML is critical in the maintenance of
quiescent leukemia-initiating cells and normal hematopoietic stem cells.
They suggested that targeting PML may be an effective treatment for
prevention of relapse in CML (608232).

Song et al. (2008) found that PTEN was aberrantly localized in APL in
which PML function was disrupted by the PML-RARA fusion oncoprotein.
Treatment with drugs that triggered PML-RARA degradation restored
nuclear PTEN. PML opposed the activity of HAUSP (USP7; 602519) towards
PTEN through a mechanism involving DAXX (603186). Confocal microscopy
and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that HAUSP was overexpressed in
prostate cancer and that levels of HAUSP directly correlated with tumor
aggressiveness and with PTEN nuclear exclusion. Song et al. (2008)
concluded that a PML-HAUSP network controls PTEN deubiquitinylation and
subcellular localization, which is perturbed in human cancers.

Arsenic, an ancient drug used in traditional Chinese medicine, has
attracted worldwide interest because it shows substantial anticancer
activity in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Arsenic
trioxide exerts its therapeutic effect by promoting degradation of
PML-RARA. PML and PML-RARA degradation is triggered by their
sumoylation, but the mechanism by which arsenic trioxide induces this
posttranslational modification was unclear. Zhang et al. (2010) showed
that arsenic binds directly to cysteine residues in zinc fingers located
within the RBCC domain of PML-RARA and PML. Arsenic binding induces PML
oligomerization, which increases its interaction with the small
ubiquitin-like protein modifier (SUMO)-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (601661),
resulting in enhanced sumoylation and degradation. Zhang et al. (2010)
concluded that the identification of PML as a direct target of arsenic
trioxide provides insights into the drug's mechanism of action and its
specificity for APL.

In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Giorgi et al. (2010) found that
extranuclear Pml was specifically enriched at the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and at the mitochondria-associated membranes, signaling domains
involved in ER-to-mitochondria calcium ion transport and in induction of
apoptosis. They found Pml in complexes of large molecular size with the
inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R; 147265), protein kinase Akt
(164730), and protein phosphatase 2a (176915). Pml was essential for
Akt- and PP2a-dependent modulation of Ip3r phosphorylation and in turn
for Ip3r-mediated calcium ion release from the endoplasmic reticulum.
Giorgi et al. (2010) concluded that their findings provided a
mechanistic explanation for the pleiotropic role of Pml in apoptosis.

Bernardi and Pandolfi (2007) reviewed the structure, dynamics, and
functions of PML-NBs.

Salomoni et al. (2008) reviewed the role of PML in tumor suppression.

- PML/RARA Fusion Protein

For information on the generation of PML/RARA fusion genes through
translocations associated with APL, see CYTOGENETICS.

Grignani et al. (1993) expressed the PML-RARA protein in U937 myeloid
precursor cells and showed that they lost the capacity to differentiate
under the action of stimuli such as vitamin D3 and transforming growth
factor beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180), acquired enhanced sensitivity to retinoic
acid, and exhibited a higher growth rate consequent to diminished
apoptotic cell death. These results provided evidence of biologic
activity of the fusion protein and recapitulated critical features of
the promyelocytic leukemia phenotype.

Lin et al. (1998) reported that the association of PLZF-RAR-alpha (see
176797) and PML-RAR-alpha with the histone deacetylase complex (see
605164) helps to determine both the development of APL and the ability
of patients to respond to retinoids. Consistent with these observations,
inhibitors of histone deacetylase dramatically potentiate
retinoid-induced differentiation of retinoic acid-sensitive, and restore
retinoid responses of retinoic acid-resistant, APL cell lines. Lin et
al. (1998) concluded that oncogenic retinoic acid receptors mediate
leukemogenesis through aberrant chromatin acetylation, and that
pharmacologic manipulation of nuclear receptor cofactors may be a useful
approach in the treatment of human disease.

Grignani et al. (1998) demonstrated that both PML-RAR-alpha and
PLZF-RAR-alpha fusion proteins recruit the nuclear corepressor (NCOR;
see 600849)-histone deacetylase complex through the RAR-alpha CoR box.
PLZF-RAR-alpha contains a second, retinoic acid-resistant binding site
in the PLZF amino-terminal region. High doses of retinoic acid release
histone deacetylase activity from PML-RAR-alpha, but not from
PLZF-RAR-alpha. Mutation of the NCOR binding site abolishes the ability
of PML-RAR-alpha to block differentiation, whereas inhibition of histone
deacetylase activity switches the transcriptional and biologic effects
of PLZF-RAR-alpha from being an inhibitor to an activator of the
retinoic acid signaling pathway. Therefore, Grignani et al. (1998)
concluded that recruitment of histone deacetylase is crucial to the
transforming potential of APL fusion proteins, and the different effects
of retinoic acid on the stability of the PML-RAR-alpha and
PLZF-RAR-alpha corepressor complexes determines the differential
response of APLs to retinoic acid.

RAR and acute myeloid leukemia-1 (AML1; 151385) transcription factors
are found in leukemias as fusion proteins with PML and ETO (CBFA2T1;
133435), respectively. Association of PML-RAR and AML1-ETO with the
NCOR-histone deacetylase complex is required to block hematopoietic
differentiation. Minucci et al. (2000) showed that PML-RAR and AML1-ETO
exist in vivo within high molecular weight nuclear complexes, reflecting
their oligomeric state. Oligomerization requires PML or ETO coiled-coil
regions and is responsible for abnormal recruitment of NCOR,
transcriptional repression, and impaired differentiation of primary
hematopoietic precursors. Fusion of RAR to a heterologous
oligomerization domain recapitulated the properties of PML-RAR,
indicating that oligomerization per se is sufficient to achieve
transforming potential. These results showed that oligomerization of a
transcription factor, imposing an altered interaction with
transcriptional coregulators, represents a novel mechanism of oncogenic
activation.

The recruitment of the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (NCOR2; 600848)
and subsequent repression of retinoid target genes is critical for the
oncogenic function of PML-RARA. Lin and Evans (2000) showed that the
ability of PML-RARA to form homodimers is both necessary and sufficient
for its increased binding efficiency to corepressor and its inhibitory
effects on hormonal responses in myeloid differentiation. Furthermore,
the authors found that altered stoichiometric interaction of SMRT with
PML-RARA homodimers may underlie these processes. An RXR mutant lacking
transactivation function AF2 recapitulated many biochemical and
functional properties of PML-RARA. Taken together, these results
indicated that altered dimerization of a transcription factor can be
directly linked to cellular transformation, and they implicated
dimerization interfaces of oncogenes as potential drug targets.

Pandolfi (2001) reviewed the roles of the RARA and PML genes in the
pathogenesis of APL and discussed the multiple oncogenic activities of
PML-RARA.

Di Croce et al. (2002) demonstrated that PML-RARA fusion protein induces
gene hypermethylation and silencing by recruiting DNA methyltransferases
to target promoters and that hypermethylation contributes to its
leukemogenic potential. Retinoic acid treatment induces promoter
demethylation, gene reexpression, and reversion of the transformed
phenotype. Di Croce et al. (2002) concluded that their results establish
a mechanistic link between genetic and epigenetic changes during
transformation and suggest that hypermethylation contributes to the
early steps of carcinogenesis.

The fusion protein PML-RARA initiates APL when expressed in the early
myeloid compartment of transgenic mice. Lane and Ley (2003) found that
PML-RARA was cleaved in several positions by a neutral serine protease
in a human myeloid cell line; purification revealed that the protease
was neutrophil elastase (ELA2; 130130). Immunofluorescence localization
studies suggested that cleavage of PML-RARA must have occurred within
the cell, perhaps within the nucleus. The functional importance of ELA2
for APL development was assessed in Ela2-deficient mice. More than 90%
of bone marrow PML-RARA-cleaving activity was lost in the absence of
Ela2, and Ela2-deficient animals, but not cathepsin G (116830)-deficient
animals, were protected from APL development. The authors determined
that primary mouse and human APL cells also contained ELA2-dependent
PML-RARA-cleaving activity. Lane and Ley (2003) concluded that, since
ELA2 is maximally produced in promyelocytes, it may play a role in APL
pathogenesis by facilitating the leukemogenic potential of PML-RARA.

Villa et al. (2006) found that MBD1 (156535) cooperated with PML-RARA in
transcriptional repression and cellular transformation in human cell
lines. PML-RARA recruited MBD1 to its target promoter through an HDAC3
(605166)-mediated mechanism. Binding of HDAC3 and MBD1 was not confined
to the target promoter, but was instead spread over the locus. Knockdown
of HDAC3 expression by RNA interference in acute promyelocytic leukemia
cells alleviated PML-RARA-induced promoter silencing. Furthermore,
retroviral expression of dominant-negative mutants of MBD1 in human
hematopoietic precursors interfered with PML-RARA-induced repression and
restored cell differentiation. Villa et al. (2006) concluded that
PML-RARA recruits an HDAC3-MBD1 complex to target promoters to establish
and maintain chromatin silencing.

CYTOGENETICS

- PML/RARA Fusion Gene

In the process of analyzing the RARA gene in the t(15;17)(q22;q11.2-q12)
translocation specifically associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL), de The et al. (1990) identified a novel gene on chromosome 15
involved with the RARA gene in formation of a fusion product. This gene,
which they called MYL, was transcribed in the same direction as RARA on
the translocated chromosome. In the chimeric gene, the promoter and
first exon of the RARA gene were replaced by part of the MYL gene. De
The et al. (1990) established that the translocation chromosome
generates an MYL-RARA chimeric transcript. The findings strongly
implicated RARA in leukemogenesis. The possibility was raised that the
altered retinoic acid receptor behaves as a dominant-negative mutant
that blocks the expression of retinoic acid target genes involved in
granulocytic differentiation. In a later report, de The et al. (1991)
changed the name of the gene from MYL to PML. The PML-RARA mRNA encoded
a predicted 106-kD chimeric protein containing most of the PML sequences
fused to a large part of the RARA gene, including its DNA- and
hormone-binding domains.

Goddard et al. (1991) determined that the PML breakpoints were clustered
in 2 regions on either side of an alternatively spliced exon. Although
leukemic cells with translocations characteristically expressed only 1
fusion product, both PML-RARA (on the 15q+ derivative chromosome) and
RARA-PML (on the 17q- derivative) were transcribed. The contribution of
PML to the oncogenicity of the fusion products was demonstrated by the
following: no mutations affecting RARA alone were observed in 20 APLs
analyzed; 2 APLs cytogenetically lacking t(15;17) chromosomes were found
to have rearrangements of both PML and RARA; and PML but not RARA was
molecularly rearranged in a variant APL translocation in which
chromosome 15 had been translocated to another chromosome with no
visible involvement of chromosome 17.

Tong et al. (1992) found that in 20 of 22 patients with a detectable MYL
rearrangement the breakpoints were clustered within a 4.4-kb segment,
which they designated MYL(bcr). The 2 remaining patients exhibited a
more 5-prime rearrangement at about 10-kb upstream of the MYL(bcr)
region, indicating the lack of at least one MYL gene exon in the
resulting MYL-RARA fusion gene.

Cleary (1991) pointed out that detection of the PML-RARA fusion links a
specific molecular defect in neoplasia with a characteristic biologic
and clinical response to pharmacologic therapy. It is a useful marker
for the diagnosis of APL and for the identification of patients who may
benefit from retinoid treatment.

PML, the gene involved in the breakpoint on chromosome 15, is a putative
transcription factor: it contains a cysteine-rich motif that resembles a
zinc finger DNA-binding domain common to several classes of
transcriptional factors. Two fusion genes, PML-RARA and RARA-PML, are
formed as a result of the characteristic translocation in APL.
Heterogeneity of the chromosome 15 breakpoints accounts for the diverse
architecture of the PML-RARA mRNAs isolated from different APL patients,
and alternative splicing of PML exons gives rise to multiple isoforms of
the PML-RARA mRNAs even within a single patient. Alcalay et al. (1992)
investigated the organization and expression pattern of the RARA/PML
gene in a series of APL patients. A RARA-PML transcript was present in
most but not all APL patients. Among 70 patients with APL, Diverio et
al. (1992) found an abnormality in intron 2 of the RARA gene in all
cases, with clustering of rearrangements within the 20-kb intronic
region separating exons 2 and 3. A curious difference was found in the
location of breakpoints in males and females: breakpoints at the 5-prime
end of intron 2 of the RARA gene occurred in females and 3-prime
breakpoints predominated in males.

Stock et al. (2000) pointed out that breakpoints in chromosomes 15 and
17 leading to the translocation associated with APL had been described
as located between 15q22 and 15q26, and between 17q11 and 17q25. Most
studies using FISH had indicated the chromosome 15 breakpoint to be in
15q22. Stock et al. (2000) used a combination of G-banding, FISH, and
chromosome microdissection/reverse in situ hybridization to map the
breakpoints precisely to 15q24 and 17q21.1.

Zaccaria et al. (2002) studied a rare example of cryptic translocation
causing APL. Conventional cytogenetics showed a normal karyotype; PCR
showed a typical PML-RARA rearrangement in exon 1. FISH analysis
revealed that a submicroscopic part of chromosome 15 had been inserted
into 17q. Zaccaria et al. (2002) reviewed other cases of cryptic
translocation; their report appeared to be the first in which both pairs
of chromosomes 15 and 17 were cytogenetically normal and a PML-RARA
fusion gene, discovered after FISH analysis, was located on chromosome
17. A poor response to ATRA therapy was postulated to have a
relationship to the atypical translocation.

Abreu e Lima et al. (2005) described a 47-year-old woman with acute
myeloid leukemia who had simultaneous expression of the PML/RARA and the
AML1/ETO (133435) fusion genes. Despite prolonged use of therapeutic
doses of ATRA plus chemotherapy, the patient did not achieve remission,
in contrast to the experience of most patients with such fusion genes.
Conventional cytogenetics in this case showed the presence of only the
t(8;21) translocation. In previous reports of coexpression of these 2
fusion genes there was evidence of the presence of 2 or 3 distinct
leukemic clones harboring either or both chromosomal translocations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Brown et al. (1997) established a transgenic mouse model that documented
the ability of the chimeric PML-RARA gene to initiate leukemogenesis.
The mice developed 2 currently unrelated abnormalities. The first was a
severe papillomatosis of the skin; the second was a disturbance of
hematopoiesis that presented as a partial block of differentiation in
the neutrophil lineage of the transgenic mice and then progressed at low
frequency to overt APL. The leukemia appeared to be a faithful
reproduction of the human disease, including a therapeutic response to
retinoic acid that reflected differentiation of the leukemic cells. Both
the preleukemic state and the overt leukemia could be transplanted into
nontransgenic hosts. Brown et al. (1997) commented that the model should
be useful for exploring the pathogenesis and treatment of APL.

From studies in mice with disruption of the Pml gene, Wang et al. (1998)
demonstrated that normally, PML regulates hemopoietic differentiation
and controls cell growth and tumorigenesis. PML function is essential
for the tumor-growth-suppressive activity of retinoic acid (RA) and for
its ability to induce terminal myeloid differentiation of precursor
cells. PML was needed for the RA-dependent transactivation of the
p21(Waf1/Cip1) gene (116899), which regulates cell cycle progression and
cellular differentiation. These results provided a framework for
understanding the molecular pathogenesis of APL. Whereas APL might
result from the functional interference of PML/RARA with 2 independent
pathways, PML and RXR/RAR, Wang et al. (1998) showed that these proteins
act, at least in part, in the same pathway. Thus, by simultaneously
interacting with RXR and PML, the fusion gene product may inactivate
this pathway at multiple levels, leading to the proliferative advantage
and the block of hemopoietic differentiation that characterize APL.

David et al. (1997) generated an inducible line of transgenic mice in
which the expression of PML-RARA is driven by the metallothionein
promoter. After 5 days zinc stimulation, 27 of 54 mice developed hepatic
preneoplasia and neoplasia including foci of basophilic hepatocytes,
dysplasia, and carcinoma, with a significantly higher incidence of
lesions in females than in males. The rapid onset of liver pathologies
was dependent on overexpression of the transgene, since it was not
detected in noninduced transgenic animals of the same age. The PML-RARA
protein was always present in altered tissues at much higher levels than
in the surrounding normal liver tissues. In addition, overexpression of
PML-RARA resulted in a strong proliferative response in the hepatocytes.
David et al. (1997) concluded that overexpression of PML-RARA
deregulates subproliferation and can induce tumorigenic changes in vivo.

In an animal model of acute promyelocytic leukemia, Padua et al. (2003)
developed a DNA-based vaccine by fusing the human PML-RARA oncogene to
tetanus fragment C (FrC) sequences. Padua et al. (2003) showed for the
first time that a DNA vaccine specifically targeted to an oncoprotein
can have a pronounced effect on survival, both alone and in combination
with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The survival advantage was
concomitant with time-dependent antibody production and an increase in
interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). Padua et al. (2003) also showed that
ATRA therapy on its own triggered an immune response in this model. When
DNA vaccination and conventional ATRA therapy were combined, they
induced protective immune responses against leukemia progression in
mice. Padua et al. (2003) concluded that this may provide a new approach
to improve clinical outcome in human leukemia.

193065	TITLE *193065 VINCULIN; VCL
METAVINCULIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vinculin is a cytoskeletal protein associated with the cytoplasmic face
of both cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adherens-type junctions,
where it is thought to function as one of several interacting proteins
involved in anchoring F-actin to the membrane (Weller et al., 1990).

CLONING

Weller et al. (1990) determined the complete sequence of the human
vinculin gene. They found that both human and chicken embryo sequences
of vinculin contain 1,066 amino acids and, furthermore, that the 2
proteins exhibit a high level of sequence identity (greater than 95%).
Southern blots of human genomic DNA hybridized with short vinculin cDNA
fragments indicated that there is a single vinculin gene.

Koteliansky et al. (1992) determined that metavinculin is the result of
alternative splicing of the VCL gene and contains an additional exon.
Across species, the deduced protein differs from vinculin in having an
additional insert of 68 to 79 amino acids in the C-terminal half of the
molecule. By comparison of metavinculin sequences from pig, man,
chicken, and frog, Strasser et al. (1993) found a division of the insert
into 2 parts: the first variable and the second highly conserved. The
longest insert, 79 amino acids, was found in Xenopus laevis. Three
different C-terminal constructs of vinculin and metavinculin
overexpressed in E. coli could be purified by column chromatography.
Using amino acid sequencing methods on the intact molecules and their
proteolytic subfragments, together with a polyclonal antibody specific
only for metavinculin from porcine stomach, Gimona et al. (1988)
identified and sequenced the insert in the porcine metavinculin
molecule. By alignment with the complete sequence of chick fibroblast
vinculin, they determined the exact location of the insert. In porcine
metavinculin, this insert lies between the 90-kD protease-resistant
N-terminal core and the C terminus of the molecule. It contains 68 amino
acids and is flanked by KWSSK sequences, one of which is present in
vinculin. The identity of the mapped vinculin and metavinculin sequences
outside this different peptide is consistent with 2 proteins arising via
alternative splicing at the mRNA level.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moiseyeva et al. (1993) determined that the VCL gene contains 22 exons
spanning greater than 75 kb. Alternative splicing of exon 19 results in
the cardiac- and smooth muscle-specific metavinculin isoform, containing
an additional 68 amino acids.

MAPPING

By use of a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, Weller et al.
(1990) mapped the VCL gene to chromosome 10q11.2-qter. By linkage
studies in a 3-generation family, Mulligan et al. (1992) mapped the VCL
gene to chromosome 10q22.1-q23, distal to D10S22. They confirmed the
assignment by hybridization of the vinculin cDNA to flow-sorted
translocation derivative chromosomes containing that portion of
chromosome 10.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Bakolitsa et al. (2004) described the crystal structure of the
full-length vinculin molecule (1,066 amino acids), which shows a
5-domain autoinhibited conformation in which the carboxy-terminal tail
domain is held pincer-like by the vinculin head, and ligand binding is
regulated both sterically and allosterically. Bakolitsa et al. (2004)
showed that the conformational changes in the head, tail, and
proline-rich domains are linked structurally and thermodynamically, and
proposed a combinatorial pathway to activation that ensures that
vinculin is activated only at sites of cell adhesion when 2 or more of
its binding partners are brought into apposition.

Using magnetic tweezers, total internal reflection fluorescence, and
atomic force microscopy, del Rio et al. (2009) investigated the effect
of force on the interaction between talin (186745), a protein that links
liganded membrane integrins to the cytoskeleton, and vinculin, a focal
adhesion protein that is activated by talin binding, leading to
reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Application of physiologically
relevant forces caused stretching of single talin rods that exposed
cryptic binding sites for vinculin. Thus in the talin-vinculin system,
molecular mechanotransduction can occur by protein binding after
exposure of buried binding sites in the talin-vinculin system.

GENE FUNCTION

Turner and Burridge (1989) reported experiments indicating that vinculin
is the major talin-binding protein in platelets. However, in addition, a
less abundant protein of approximately 150 kD also interacted strongly
with the talin fragment. Turner and Burridge (1989) confirmed that this
protein is metavinculin, a protein previously believed to be confined to
cardiac and smooth muscle tissue.

Hu et al. (2007) developed correlational fluorescent speckle microscopy
to measure the coupling of focal adhesion proteins to actin filaments
(see 102610). Different classes of focal adhesion structural and
regulatory molecules exhibited varying degrees of correlated motions
with actin filaments, indicating hierarchical transmission of actin
motion through focal adhesions. Interactions between vinculin, talin,
and actin filaments appear to constitute a slippage interface between
the cytoskeleton and integrins, generating a molecular clutch that is
regulated during the morphodynamic transitions of cell migration.

Using immunohistochemistry, Vasile et al. (2006) examined the pattern of
vinculin/metavinculin expression in the intercalated- and Z discs of
cardiomyocytes from patients with various cardiovascular conditions
associated with hypertrophy. Tissue specimens derived from patients with
obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH; see CMH15, 613255) and
aortic stenosis (see 109730) showed a universal defect of
vinculin/metavinculin expression in the intercalated disc but preserved
expression in the cardiac Z disc, whereas tissue specimens from patients
with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD; see CMD1W, 611407), hypertensive heart
disease (see 145500), or pulmonary hypertension (see 178600) exhibited
normal expression of vinculin/metavinculin in both the Z and the
intercalated disc, despite being associated with hypertrophy. Vasile et
al. (2006) suggested that differential expression of
vinculin/metavinculin in cardiac hypertrophy might depend on the
underlying pathophysiology, with localization unaffected by hemodynamic
overload but expression in the intercalated disc substantially reduced
by obstructive disease.

Kanchanawong et al. (2010) used 3-dimensional super-resolution
fluorescence microscopy to map nanoscale protein organization in focal
adhesions. Their results revealed that integrins and actin are
vertically separated by an approximately 40-nm focal adhesion core
region consisting of multiple protein-specific strata: a
membrane-apposed integrin signaling layer containing integrin
cytoplasmic tails (see 193210), focal adhesion kinase (600758), and
paxillin (602505); an intermediate force-transduction layer containing
talin and vinculin; and an uppermost actin-regulatory layer containing
zyxin (602002), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (601703), and
alpha-actinin (102575). By localizing amino- and carboxy-terminally
tagged talins, Kanchanawong et al. (2010) revealed talin's polarized
orientation, indicative of a role in organizing the focal adhesion
strata. Kanchanawong et al. (2010) concluded that their composite
multilaminar protein architecture provided a molecular blueprint for
understanding focal adhesion functions.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Olson et al. (2002) used SSCP to analyze the vinculin gene in 350
unrelated patients with sporadic or familial dilated cardiomyopathy
(611407) who were negative for mutations in the ACTC (102540) and TPM1
(191010) genes, and identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp in-frame
deletion (L954del; 193065.0001) and a missense mutation (R975W;
193065.0002) in 2 patients, respectively. Neither mutation was found in
500 controls. A potential risk-conferring polymorphism, A934V, was
identified in heterozygosity in a 30-year-old man with dilated
cardiomyopathy who died 2 years after diagnosis of progressive heart
failure; this variant was also found in 1 of 500 controls, a 67-year-old
woman in whom electrocardiography showed abnormal T waves but
echocardiogram was nondiagnostic for dilated cardiomyopathy. All
variants were located in exon 19, the metavinculin-specific exon of the
vinculin gene. Low-shear viscometry studies revealed variable reductions
in viscosity associated with the mutations, with greater reductions
caused by the L954del and R975W mutants. Fluorescence microscopy
confirmed the viscosity findings, with actin organization by the A934V
variant similar to wildtype, although the network appeared coarser; more
prominent bundles were observed for L954del, and R975W showed the
highest bundling activity. Electron microscopy of cardiac myocytes from
a patient with the R975W mutation showed irregular and fragmented
intercalated discs, with intact sarcomeric thin and thick filaments.

Vasile et al. (2006) analyzed the metavinculin-specific exon 19 of the
VCL gene in 389 unrelated patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(CMH), who were negative for mutation in 8 known CMH-associated
sarcomere/myofilament-encoding genes, and identified heterozygosity for
the R975W mutation in a patient with CMH15 (613255).

In a cohort of 228 CMH patients who were negative for mutation in 12
known CMH-associated sarcomere/myofilament-encoding genes, Vasile et al.
(2006) performed comprehensive analysis of the 22 exons of the VCL gene
and identified a heterozygous mutation in 1 patient (L277M;
193065.0003). The authors noted that despite its ubiquitous expression,
the HCM-associated VCL mutation clinically yielded a cardiac-specific
phenotype.

ANIMAL MODEL

Xu et al. (1998) used a targeting vector to inactivate vinculin in
embryonic stem cells, which were then injected into mice. They found
that Vcl -/- embryos failed to develop beyond the tenth day of gestation
and at best were two-thirds of the normal size range. The most prominent
defect was lack of midline fusion of the rostral neural tube, producing
a cranial bilobular appearance and attenuation of cranial and spinal
nerve development. Heart development was curtailed at E9.5, with
severely reduced and akinetic myocardial and endocardial structures.
Somites and limbs were retarded, and ectodermal tissues were sparse and
fragile. Fibroblasts isolated from mutant embryos showed reduced
adhesion to fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, and collagen compared to
wildtype. In addition, migration rates over these substrata were 2-fold
higher and the level of focal adhesion kinase (FAK; 600758) was 3-fold
higher. Xu et al. (1998) concluded that vinculin is necessary for normal
embryonic development, probably because of its role in the regulation of
cell adhesion and locomotion, although specific roles in neural and
cardiac development could not be ruled out.

Richards et al. (2005) analyzed hearts from Vcl +/- and wildtype mice
and found that although decreased vinculin expression enhanced
inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias, connexin-43 (GJA1; 121014)
content and distribution, and conduction velocities, were not
significantly different between mutant and wildtype mice. Richards et
al. (2005) suggested that other mechanisms, such as altered integrin
(see 192968) signaling, might contribute to arrhythmogenesis.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1W
VCL, 3-BP DEL, 2862GTT

In a 39-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1W; 611407), Olson
et al. (2002) identified heterozygosity for a 3-bp deletion (2862delGTT)
in exon 19 of the vinculin gene, resulting in the in-frame deletion of a
leucine residue (leu954del). The patient's father died of heart failure
at 59 years of age, and a 70-year-old paternal uncle had heart failure,
but the patient's relatives declined clinical and genetic evaluation.
The mutation was not found in 500 unrelated controls.

.0002
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1W
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 15
VCL, ARG975TRP

In a 57-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1W; 611407) who
had undergone cardiac transplantation, Olson et al. (2002) identified
heterozygosity for a 2923C-T transition in exon 19 of the vinculin gene,
resulting in an arg975-to-trp (R975W) substitution in the metavinculin
isoform. The mutation was also found in heterozygosity in 3 asymptomatic
relatives, 2 of whom were found to have disease on screening
echocardiogram: a 70-year-old maternal aunt had dilated cardiomyopathy,
and a 38-year-old daughter had mild left ventricular dilation. The
patient's 55-year-old sister carried the mutation but had normal left
ventricular dimensions and shortening/ejection fractions. The mutation
was not found in 500 unrelated controls.

In a 43-year-old woman with severe apical variant hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH15; 613255), Vasile et al. (2006) identified
heterozygosity for the R975W substitution in the VCL gene, located in a
highly conserved residue in the tail region of metavinculin and
predicted to cause significant alterations in the secondary structure
and helical organization of the protein. The mutation was not found in
1,400 reference allele. Immunohistochemical analysis of the patient's
myocardium demonstrated a marked reduction of both vinculin and
metavinculin in the intercalated discs. Noting that the patient was
homozygous for wildtype vinculin and heterozygous for R975W
metavinculin, Vasile et al. (2006) suggested that the marked reduction
of proteins in the intercalated discs might be due to a
dominant-negative effect. However, after analyzing immunohistochemically
stained tissue specimens from patients with various cardiovascular
conditions associated with hypertrophy, Vasile et al. (2006) suggested
that differential expression of vinculin/metavinculin in cardiac
hypertrophy might depend on the underlying pathophysiology, with
localization unaffected by hemodynamic overload but expression in the
intercalated disc substantially reduced by obstructive disease (see GENE
FUNCTION).

.0003
CARDIOMYOPATHY, FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC, 15
VCL, LEU277MET

In a 76-year-old Caucasian woman with severely obstructive hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (CMH15; 613255), Vasile et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous 829C-A transversion in exon 8 of the VCL gene, resulting in
a leu277-to-met (L277M) substitution at a conserved residue in a key
functional domain. The mutation was not detected in 400 reference
alleles. Immunostaining of myomectomy tissue from the patient showed
normal Z line staining but markedly reduced vinculin/metavinculin
staining in the intercalated discs.

608684	TITLE *608684 NINEIN; NIN
;;GSK3B-INTERACTING PROTEIN;;
KIAA1565
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ninein is a centrosomal protein required for the centrosome to function
as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and is essential for the
reformation of the interphase centrosome architecture following mitosis
(Ou et al., 2002).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned NIN, which they designated
KIAA1565. RT-PCR ELISA detected high NIN expression in ovary, spleen,
adult whole brain, and all individual brain regions examined. Expression
was intermediate in all other adult and fetal tissues examined except
testis, which showed no expression.

Using GSK3B (605004) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a fetal liver
cDNA library, followed by EST contig searching and 5-prime RACE of fetal
liver cDNA, Hong et al. (2000) cloned full-length NIN. The deduced
2,047-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 239 kD. NIN
contains an N-terminal GTP-binding site, a large coiled-coil domain with
4 leucine zipper motifs, and a C-terminal domain responsible for GSK
binding. Unlike mouse Nin, it does not have an N-terminal Ca(2+)-binding
site. Northern blot analysis detected a 9.0-kb transcript in all tissues
examined and a 7.0-kb transcript predominantly in heart and skeletal
muscle. Fluorescence-labeled NIN localized in the perinuclear foci
characteristic of centrosomes in transfected COS-1 cells.

Hong et al. (2000) cloned a splice variant of NIN, which they designated
ninein-lm (ninein like mouse) because the protein contains an N-terminal
Ca(2+)-binding site. This variant lacks intron 1 and utilizes an
alternate splice site in exon 2 that results in more 5-prime sequence of
exon 2. Ninein-lm encodes a deduced 2,041-amino acid protein with a
calculated molecular mass of 238 kD. RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis
indicated that ninein-lm expression was 20- to 50-fold higher than
ninein expression in all tissues tested except pancreas.

By Western blot analysis, Chen et al. (2003) determined that endogenous
HeLa cell ninein had an apparent molecular mass of about 230 kD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hong et al. (2000) determined that the NIN gene contains 29 exons and
spans about 130 kb. The promoter region contains a TATA box, 2 CCAAT
boxes, and 3 GC boxes. It also has 4 Sp1 (189906)-binding sites, 2 p300
(602700)-binding sites, and 1 AP1 (165160)-binding site.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and radiation hybrid analysis, Hong et al.
(2000) mapped the NIN gene to chromosome 14q22.

GENE FUNCTION

Hong et al. (2000) determined that the C termini of ninein and ninein-lm
bound GSK3B. The coiled-coil domain, but not the leucine-zipper domains,
mediated the interaction. The coiled-coil domain also mediated
oligomerization.

The mammalian centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles surrounded by
pericentriolar material (PCM). Ou et al. (2002) stated that a subset of
PCM proteins are arranged in a tubular conformation with an open and a
closed end within the centrosome. They found that, in the mother
centrosome, ninein and CEP110 (605496) were distributed at both ends of
the centrosome tube, including the site of centrosome duplication.
However, in the daughter centrosome, ninein and CEP110 were present only
at the closed end, where they colocalized with CEP250. The appearance of
ninein and CEP110 at the open end of the daughter centrosome occurred
during the telophase-G1 transition of the next cell cycle, concomitant
with the maturation of the daughter centrosome into a mother centrosome.
Microinjection of antibodies against either ninein or CEP110 into
metaphase HeLa cells disrupted the reformation of the tubular
conformation of proteins within the centrosome following cell division
and led to dispersal of centrosomal material throughout the cytosol.
Microinjection of antibodies to either ninein or CEP110 into metaphase
kangaroo rat kidney cells not only disrupted the tubular configuration
within the centrosome, but also affected the centrosome's ability to
function as an MTOC. Centrosomal architecture was not disrupted if
antibodies were microinjected into postmitotic cells with fully formed
centrosomes, but the MTOC function of the centrosomes was disrupted.

Chen et al. (2003) showed that the coiled-coil II (CCII) domain of
ninein, which contains a centrosome targeting signal, colocalized with
gamma-tubulin (191135) and centrin (see CENT1 603187) at the centrosome
of transfected HeLa cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that
ninein protein disappeared from spindle poles during metaphase and
anaphase, but reaccumulated at centrosomes at the end of cell division.
In vitro kinase assays indicated that the CCII domain was readily
phosphorylated by AIK (AURKA; 603072) and PKA (see 176911).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 sisters with severe short stature, microcephaly, and developmental
delay (Seckel syndrome-7; SCKL7, 614851), Dauber et al. (2012)
identified compound heterozygosity for missense mutations in the NIN
gene, Q1222R (608684.0001) and N1709S (608684.0002).

ANIMAL MODEL

Dauber et al. (2012) performed morpholino knockdown of ninein in
zebrafish and observed defects in the anterior neuroectoderm that
resulted in a deformity of the developing cranium, with a small, squared
skull highly reminiscent of the human phenotype.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SECKEL SYNDROME 7
NIN, GLN1222ARG

In 2 sisters with severe short stature, microcephaly, and developmental
delay (SCKL7; 614851), Dauber et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for a 3667G-A transition in exon 18 of the NIN gene,
resulting in a gln1222-to-arg (Q1222R) substitution, and a 5128A-G
transition in exon 23, resulting in an asn1709-to-ser (N1709S;
608684.0002) substitution; both substitutions occurred at evolutionarily
conserved residues. The unaffected parents were each heterozygous for 1
of the mutations, neither of which was present in the SNP database or
the NHLBI exome variant server; however, the Q1222R variant was present
in the 1000 Genomes pilot data, with an overall minor allele frequency
of 0.001. Functional analysis of patient fibroblasts suggested that the
compound heterozygous NIN defects did not disrupt ninein expression or
localization or affect mitotic functions in an obvious way.
