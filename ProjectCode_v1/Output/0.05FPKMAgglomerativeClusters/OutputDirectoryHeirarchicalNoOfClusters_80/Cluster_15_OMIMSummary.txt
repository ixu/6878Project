600848	TITLE *600848 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COREPRESSOR 2; NCOR2
;;SILENCING MEDIATOR FOR RETINOID AND THYROID HORMONE RECEPTORS; SMRT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NCOR2 is a transcriptional corepressor that maintains the 'off state' of
nonliganded nuclear receptors. Its interaction with nuclear receptors is
mediated by 2 C-terminal receptor-interacting domains (RIDs). NCOR2
facilitates transcriptional repression by serving as a scaffold protein
to recruit histone deacetylase complexes and chromatin-remodeling
factors (summary by Pei et al., 2011).

CLONING

Transcriptional silencing mediated by nuclear receptors is important in
development, differentiation, and oncogenesis. Chen and Evans (1995)
identified a receptor-interacting factor, NCOR2, which they designated
SMRT, as a silencing mediator (corepressor) for retinoid receptors (see
180240) and thyroid hormone receptors (see 190120). They cloned SMRT
from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The deduced 1,495-amino acid protein has
a calculated molecular mass of 168 kD. It has a proline-rich N-terminal
domain, followed by ERDR and SG regions and a C-terminal domain that
shares significant similarity with mouse Rip13 (NCOR1; 600849). Chen and
Evans (1995) also identified a splice variant of SMRT that encodes a
protein lacking a 46-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal domain.
Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous SMRT expression.
Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that SMRT is a nuclear protein.
Horlein et al. (1995) proposed that SMRT and NCOR (NCOR1; 600849) belong
to a family of corepressors that they termed TRACs (thyroid hormone- and
retinoic acid receptor-associated corepressors).

Using mouse Smrt and successive 5-prime proximal probes, Ordentlich et
al. (1999) cloned full-length human SMRT from a pituitary cDNA library.
The deduced protein contains 2,517 amino acid. The N terminus contains 2
repression domains separated by a SANT domain and is highly homologous
to the N terminus of NCOR1. Northern blot analysis detected a SMRT
transcript of about 10 kb in all mouse tissues examined, with highest
expression in brain, lung, and spleen. A minor transcript of 8.5 kb was
also detected in most tissues. Ordentlich et al. (1999) also cloned a
splice variant of Smrt from mouse brain that encodes a protein lacking
amino acids 36 through 254 of full-length Ncor2.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Binding of ligand to nuclear hormone receptors induces a conformation
that attracts coactivator proteins containing a leu-x-x-leu-leu motif,
the so-called NR box. Hu and Lazar (1999) showed that NCOR1 and SMRT
contain sequences that are similar to the NR box and are repeated in
each of 2 nuclear hormone receptor interaction domains. Hu and Lazar
(1999) called this box (L/I-x-x-I/V-I) the CoRNR (corepressor/nuclear
receptor; 'corner') box. The corner box is required for nuclear hormone
receptor interaction, and corner box peptides specifically block
corepressor interaction in vitro and repression in vivo. Sequences
flanking the corner box determine nuclear hormone receptor specificity.
Thus, Hu and Lazar (1999) concluded that the key feature of hormone
action, differential recognition of unliganded and liganded nuclear
hormone receptors by coactivators and corepressors, is due to very
subtle differences between CoRNR and NR boxes.

- Crystal Structure

Watson et al. (2012) reported the structure of a complex between an HDAC
(HDAC3; 605166) and a corepressor, NCOR2. The structure revealed 2
remarkable features. First, the SMRT-deacetylase activation domain (DAD)
undergoes a large structural rearrangement on forming the complex.
Second, there is an essential inositol tetraphosphate molecule,
D-myo-inositol-(1,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5,6)P4), acting as
an 'intermolecular glue' between the 2 proteins. Assembly of the complex
is clearly dependent on the Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, which may act as a
regulator, potentially explaining why inositol phosphates and their
kinases have been found to act as transcriptional regulators. This
mechanism for the activation of HDAC3 appears to be conserved in class I
HDACs from yeast to humans, and the authors suggested it opens the way
to novel therapeutic opportunities.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen and Evans (1995) found that association of SMRT with receptors,
both in solution and bound to DNA response elements, was destabilized by
ligand. The interaction with mutant receptors correlated with their
transcriptional silencing activities. The repressor function of thyroid
hormone receptor and retinoic acid receptor appeared to involve direct
interaction with SMRT, possibly in a way that stabilized or promoted
their interaction with the transcription factor TFIIB (189963). Chen and
Evans (1995) showed that ligand caused dissociation of SMRT from the
receptor, triggering the activation process.

Fischle et al. (2002) showed that the catalytic domain of HDAC4 (605314)
interacts with HDAC3 (605166) via the transcriptional corepressor NCOR2.
All experimental conditions leading to the suppression of HDAC4 binding
to NCOR2 and to HDAC3 resulted in loss of enzymatic activity associated
with HDAC4. These observations indicated that class II HDACs regulate
transcription by bridging the enzymatically active NCOR2-HDAC3 complex
and select transcription factors.

Hoberg et al. (2004) presented evidence that IKK-alpha (CHUK; 600664)
phosphorylates chromatin-bound SMRT, stimulating its removal from
chromatin and allowing recruitment of NFKB (see 164011) to promoters and
transcription of NFKB-dependent genes.

Jepsen et al. (2007) reported a critical role for SMRT in forebrain
development and in maintenance of the neural stem cell state. Analysis
of a series of markers in SMRT gene-deleted mice revealed the functional
requirement of SMRT in the actions of both retinoic acid-dependent and
Notch (see 190198)-dependent forebrain development. In isolated cortical
progenitor cells, SMRT was critical for preventing retinoic acid
receptor (see 180220)-dependent induction of differentiation along a
neuronal pathway in the absence of any ligand. Jepsen et al. (2007)
demonstrated that SMRT represses expression of the jumonji
domain-containing gene JMJD3 (611577), a direct retinoic acid receptor
target that functions as a histone H3 trimethyl K27 demethylase and
which is capable of activating specific components of the neurogenic
program.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jiang et al. (2001) determined that the NCOR2 gene contains 45 exons.

MAPPING

By FISH, Ordentlich et al. (1999) mapped the NCOR2 gene to chromosome
12q24.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pei et al. (2011) generated knockin mice expressing point mutations in
both RIDs of Smrt, which disrupted its interaction with nuclear
receptors. On a pure C57BL/6J background, these mice, which Pei et al.
(2011) called Smrt(mRID) mice, died shortly after birth from acute
respiratory distress syndrome due to abnormal terminal differentiation
of type I pneumocytes. Maternal delivery of antithyroid drugs, but not
antagonists of other nuclear receptors, rescued lethality in Smrt(mRID)
pups. Mice treated with antithyroid drugs during the time of terminal
lung differentiation were born alive, showed no evidence of respiratory
distress, and survived to adulthood. Microarray analysis revealed that
Klf2 (602016) expression was downregulated in Smrt(mRID) mice. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis of MLE-12 mouse lung carcinoma cells showed
that both Smrt and thyroid hormone receptor bound a conserved enhancer
region downstream of the mouse Klf2 gene. Overexpression of Klf2 in
MLE-12 cells upregulated expression of type I pneumocyte markers, and
targeted disruption of Klf2 in mouse lung recapitulated the phenotype of
Smrt(mRID) mice. Pei et al. (2011) concluded that regulation of KLF2
expression by SMRT is required for terminal lung development.

601128	TITLE *601128 H3 HISTONE, FAMILY 3A; H3F3A
;;H3F3;;
H3.3A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Histones are the basic nuclear proteins responsible for the nucleosome
structure within the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Five classes of
histone genes have been reported. Some classes are expressed only during
S phase, while others are replication independent. The latter are
referred to as replacement histones and are expressed in quiescent or
terminally differentiated cells. H3.3 is a replacement histone that is
encoded by 2 distinct replication-independent genes, H3.3A (H3F3A) and
H3.3B (H3F3B; 601058). The proteins encoded by the H3.3A and H3.3B genes
are identical (summary by Wells et al. (1987) and Albig et al. (1995)).

For additional background information on histones, histone gene
clusters, and the H3 histone family, see HIST1H3A (602810).

CLONING

Using an H3.3 pseudogene cDNA to probe a human fibroblast cDNA library,
Wells and Kedes (1985) cloned H3.3. The transcript contains a long
3-prime poly(A) tail, and the deduced protein contains 135 amino acids.
The H3.3 protein has 5 amino acid changes compared with H3.1 (see
602812), but their nucleotide sequences are more divergent. Northern
blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1.2 kb in HeLa cell poly(A)
RNA.

Chalmers and Wells (1990) showed that the rabbit H3.3a 3-prime
untranslated region is 94% similar to the human sequence of Wells and
Kedes (1985), indicating that evolutionary conservation extends beyond
the coding region.

Witt et al. (1997) noted that although the H3.3A and H3.3B proteins are
identical, their nucleotide coding sequences and flanking portions
differ. They reported that H3.3a was basally expressed in mouse testis,
whereas H3.3b was expressed in a stage-specific manner.

Using Northern blot analysis, Frank et al. (2003) assayed for expression
of the replacement histones H3.3A and H3.3B and the cell cycle-dependent
histone H3/m (HIST2H3C; 142780) in human tissues and cell lines. All 6
cell lines expressed H3.3A, H3.3B, and H3/m at high levels. Conversely,
fetal liver predominantly expressed H3/m, likely due to its rapid cell
growth, whereas adult liver, kidney, and heart predominantly expressed
H3.3A and H3.3B. The H3.3A transcript was detected at 1.0 kb.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wells and Kedes (1985) determined that the 5-prime UTR of the H3F3A gene
is GC rich (75%).

Wells et al. (1987) determined that the H3F3A gene contains 4 exons and
spans 8.8 kb. The first exon is noncoding. The 5-prime end contains
noncanonical TATA and CCAAT boxes and an SP1 (189906)-binding GC box.
The 3-prime end contains 2 potential polyadenylation signals and is
highly conserved, sharing 85% identity with the chicken ortholog.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by inclusion within a YAC
from that region, Lin and Wells (1997) mapped the H3F3A gene to
chromosome 1q41.

GENE FUNCTION

See HIST1H3A (602810) for functional information on the H3 histone
family.

- H3.3 Histone

Hake et al. (2006) noted that most studies on expression or
posttranslational modifications of H3 histones do not differentiate
between the H3.1 (see 602810), H3.2 (HIST2H3C; 142780), and H3.3
proteins, in part due to their high degree of amino acid identity. By
quantitative PCR of 5 human cell lines, they found that the 9 H3.1
genes, 1 H3.2 gene, and 2 H3.3 genes examined were expressed in a cell
line-specific manner. All 3 types of H3 genes were highly expressed
during S phase in human cell lines, whereas the H3.3 genes were also
highly expressed outside of S phase, consistent with their status as
replication-independent genes. Using a combination of isotopic labeling
and quantitative tandem mass spectrometry, Hake et al. (2006) showed
that the H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 proteins differed in their
posttranslational modifications. H3.1 was enriched in marks associated
with both gene activation and gene silencing, H3.2 was enriched in
repressive marks associated with gene silencing and the formation of
facultative heterochromatin, and H3.3 was enriched in marks associated
with transcriptional activation. Hake et al. (2006) concluded that H3.1,
H3.2, and H3.3 likely have unique functions and should not be treated as
equivalent proteins.

Jin et al. (2009) characterized the genomewide distribution of
nucleosome core particles containing H3.3 and/or H2A.Z (H2AFZ; 142763)
in HeLa cells. They found that highly labile particles containing both
H3.3 and H2A.Z were enriched at active promoters, enhancers, and
insulator regions. Nucleosomes containing H3.3, but not H2A.Z, were also
relatively unstable and were detected along the transcribed region of
genes and at transcriptional stop sites. Jin et al. (2009) suggested
that unstable particles containing both H3.3 and H2A.Z may serve as
place holders that are easily displaced by transcription factors. They
proposed that unstable particles containing only H3.3 along the
transcribed portions of genes may accommodate the passage of RNA
polymerase.

Xu et al. (2010) reported that significant amounts of histone H3.3-H4
(see 602822) tetramers split in vivo, whereas most H3.1 (see 602810)-H4
tetramers remain intact during mitotic division. Inhibiting DNA
replication-dependent deposition greatly reduced the level of splitting
events, which suggested that (i) the replication-independent H3.3
deposition pathway proceeds largely by cooperatively incorporating 2 new
H3.3-H4 dimers, and (ii) the majority of splitting events occur during
replication-dependent deposition. Xu et al. (2010) concluded that
'silent' histone modifications within large heterochromatic regions are
maintained by copying modifications from neighboring preexisting
histones without the need for H3-H4 splitting events.

Talbert and Henikoff (2010) reviewed the assembly of canonical
nucleosomes, which is thought to begin with a tetramer of 2 H3 molecules
and 2 H4 molecules held together by strong bonds between the H3
molecules. H3.1 is the major canonical H3 assembled into chromatin by
the histone chaperone CAF1 (see 601246) complex during DNA replication
and repair. The replacement histone H3.3 is assembled by the histone
regulator A (HIRA; 600237) complex independently of DNA synthesis.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Elsasser et al. (2012) reported the crystal structures of the DAXX
(603186) histone-binding domain with a histone H3.3-H4 (see 602822)
dimer, including mutants within DAXX and H3.3, together with in vitro
and in vivo functional studies that elucidated the principles underlying
H3.3 recognition specificity. Occupying 40% of the histone
surface-accessible area, DAXX wraps around the H3.3-H4 dimer, with
complex formation accompanied by structural transitions in the H3.3-H4
histone fold. DAXX uses an extended alpha-helical conformation to
compete with major interhistone, DNA, and ASF1 interaction sites.
Elsasser et al. (2012) concluded that their structural studies
identified recognition elements that read out H3.3-specific residues,
and functional studies addressed the contribution of gly90 in H3.3 and
glu225 in DAXX to chaperone-mediated H3.3 variant recognition
specificity.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Schwartzentruber et al. (2012) sequenced the exomes of 48 pediatric
glioblastoma (137800) samples. Somatic mutations in the H3.3-ATRX
(300032)-DAXX (603186) chromatin remodeling pathway were identified in
44% of tumors (21 of 48). Recurrent mutations in H3F3A, which encodes
the replication-independent histone-3 variant H3.3, were observed in 31%
of tumors, and led to amino acid substitutions at 2 critical positions
within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory
posttranslational modifications. Mutations in ATRX and DAXX, encoding 2
subunits of a chromatin remodeling complex required for H3.3
incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were
identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumors harboring a
G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation. Somatic TP53 (191170) mutations were
identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with H3F3A and/or
ATRX mutations. Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades
and histologies (n = 784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to
glioblastoma multiforme and highly prevalent in children and young
adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was
strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and
specific gene expression profiles. Schwartzentruber et al. (2012) stated
that this was the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a
regulatory histone in humans, and that their data suggested that defects
of the chromatin architecture underlie pediatric and young adult
glioblastoma multiforme pathogenesis.

Wu et al. (2012) reported that a K27M mutation occurring in either H3F3A
or HIST1H3B (602819) was observed in 78% of diffuse intrinsic pontine
gliomas (DIPGs) and 22% of non-brain-stem gliomas.

Lewis et al. (2013) reported that human DIPGs containing the K27M
mutation in either histone H3.3 (H3F3A) or H3.1 (HIST1H3B) display
significantly lower overall amounts of H3 with trimethylated lysine-27
(H3K27me3) and that histone H3K27M transgenes are sufficient to reduce
the amounts of H3K27me3 in vitro and in vivo. Lewis et al. (2013) found
that H3K27M inhibits the enzymatic activity of the Polycomb repressive
complex-2 (PRC2) through interaction with the EZH2 (601573) subunit. In
addition, transgenes containing lysine-to-methionine substitutions at
other known methylated lysines (H3K9 and H3K36) are sufficient to cause
specific reduction in methylation through inhibition of SET domain
enzymes. Lewis et al. (2013) proposed that K-to-M substitutions may
represent a mechanism to alter epigenetic states in a variety of
pathologies.

153390	TITLE *153390 LYMPHOCYTE-SPECIFIC PROTEIN-TYROSINE KINASE; LCK
;;ONCOGENE LCK;;
p56(LCK)
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LCK gene encodes p56(LCK), a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase of
the SRC (190090) oncogene family that is involved in transduction of
T-cell receptor (TCR; see 186880)-mediated activation. The p56(LCK)
protein is anchored to the plasma membrane and interacts with the
intracellular domains of CD4 (186940)/CD8 (see 186910) coreceptors. It
is composed of 4 SRC homology (SH) domains that are variably conserved
among members of the SRC family (Germani et al., 2003).

CLONING

Using RT-PCR, Rouer et al. (1999) identified the full-length LCK
transcript and a splice variant lacking exon 7 in various T-cell lines
and in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from healthy donors.

By RT-PCR of PBLs from diabetic patients and healthy controls, Nervi et
al. (2005) obtained cDNAs corresponding to full-length LCK, LCK lacking
exon 7 (LCK delta-7), and a novel LCK variant lacking exon 7 but
containing an additional 174 bp corresponding intron B between exons 2
and 3 (LCKB+7-). LCKB+7- encodes a 516-amino acid protein that, compared
with the full-length 509-amino acid protein, has a proline-rich 58-amino
acid insertion upstream of the SH3 domain and, like LCK delta-7, a
deletion of the ATP-binding site upstream of the catalytic domain. Far
Western blot analysis showed that the 58-amino acid insertion reduced
SH3 binding ability. RT-PCR analysis suggested that LCKB+7- is present
in all individuals but is sequestered in the nucleus. Nervi et al.
(2005) concluded that LCKB+7- is a rare transcript that may be present
in conditions with T-cell dysfunction.

GENE FUNCTION

Welte et al. (1999) analyzed the role of STAT (signal transducer and
activator of transcription) proteins in TCR signaling. STAT5 (601511)
became immediately and transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine-694 in
response to TCR stimulation. Expression of the protein-tyrosine kinase
LCK, a key signaling protein in the TCR complex, activated DNA binding
of transfected STAT5A and STAT5B to specific STAT-inducible elements.
The role of LCK in STAT5 activation was confirmed in a LCK-deficient
T-cell line in which the activation of STAT5 by TCR stimulation was
abolished. Inhibition of STAT5 function by expression of a
dominant-negative mutant STAT5 reduced antigen-stimulated proliferation
of T cells. Thus, TCR stimulation appears to directly activate STAT5,
which may participate in the regulation of gene transcription and T-cell
proliferation during immunologic responses.

Animals deficient in pre-TCR-alpha have few alpha-beta lineage cells but
an increased number of gamma-delta T cells. These gamma-delta T cells
exhibit more extensive TCR-beta rearrangement than gamma-delta T cells
from wildtype mice. These observations are consistent with the idea that
different signals emanating from the gamma-delta-TCR and pre-TCR
instruct lineage commitment. Using confocal microscopy and biochemistry
to analyze the initiation of signaling, Saint-Ruf et al. (2000) showed
that the pre-TCR, but not the gamma-delta TCR, colocalizes with the
p56(lck) Src kinase into glycolipid-enriched membrane domains (rafts)
apparently without any need for ligation. This results in the
phosphorylation of CD3-epsilon (186830) and ZAP70 signal transducing
molecules. Saint-Ruf et al. (2000) stated that their results indicated
clear differences between pre-TCR and gamma-delta-TCR signaling.

Type 1 diabetic (IDDM1; 222100) patients have diminished responses
following T-cell activation. By immunoblot analysis, Nervi et al. (2000)
found reduced levels of phosphorylated CD3Z (186780) in IDDM1 patients
after T-cell stimulation. Immunoblot, immunoprecipitation, and
densitometric analyses revealed significantly reduced LCK expression in
unstimulated peripheral blood cells of IDDM1 patients compared to
controls. The reduced LCK expression correlated with a lower
proliferative response. Very low LCK expression may also correlate with
the HLA-DQB1*0201/0302 (see 604305) genotype. Confocal microscopy
demonstrated normal plasma membrane expression of LCK in patients and
controls. Downstream signal transducing molecules were not affected in
these patients.

Kim et al. (2003) noted that the T-cell coreceptors CD4 and CD8 each
associate via their cytoplasmic tails with the N terminus of LCK in a
zinc-dependent manner. These interactions are required for T-cell
development and activation. By structural analysis, Kim et al. (2003)
showed that, in the absence of zinc, the coreceptor tails and the LCK N
terminus lack structure, but they assemble in the presence of zinc to
form compactly folded heterodimeric domains.

Using flow cytometry, Germani et al. (2003) deduced that the LCK delta-7
protein accounted for 15% of the total LCK protein in the Jurkat T-cell
line. Exon 7 encodes the first 51 amino acids of the LCK catalytic
domain, and deletion of this region reduced kinase activity of the
recombinant protein. However, the residual activity could be enhanced by
addition of Mn(2+). Enforced production of LCK delta-7 in transfected
Jurkat cells resulted in slower cell proliferation than did transfection
with full-length LCK. Germani et al. (2003) proposed that LCK delta-7 is
a cell signaling regulator. They noted that a case of severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) had been reported in which levels of full-length
LCK were low and LCK delta-7 appeared as the main LCK transcript (see
Goldman et al. (1998) and MOLECULAR GENETICS).

Using protein pull-down assays, Park et al. (2002) showed that the
N-terminal ser-rich portion of the herpesvirus Tip protein interacted
with the N terminus of the lysosomal protein WDR48 (612167). Interaction
of Tip with WDR48 induced lysosomal vesicle formation and, via the
C-terminal region of Tip, recruitment of LCK to these lysosomal vesicles
for degradation. Tip interactions with WDR48 and LCK resulted in
downregulation of TCR and CD4 surface expression, respectively, leading
to inhibition of T-lymphocyte signal transduction.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nervi et al. (2005) stated that the LCK gene contains 12 exons and spans
14 kb. Expression of LCK is controlled by 2 distinct promoters separated
by 35 kb. Alternate usage of the promoters produces 2 major classes of
mRNAs that differ only in their noncoding 5-prime ends. Alternative
splicing and the use of alternative transcription initiation sites
generates several variants in each mRNA class.

MAPPING

Marth et al. (1986) mapped the mouse Lck gene to distal chromosome 4.
Using molecular analysis by somatic cell hybridization and in situ
hybridization, they mapped the human LCK gene to chromosome 1p35-p32.
They noted that LCK closely resembles other protein-tyrosine kinase
oncogenes, notably SRC, YES (164880), and FGR (164940), and that
virus-induced murine lymphomas have been found with rearrangement of the
Lck gene, suggesting that aberrant expression of LCK may contribute to
lymphoid transformation. In man, chromosome abnormalities, deletions, or
translocations are seen in 1p34 in neuroblastomas (Gilbert et al., 1982)
and in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Levine et al., 1985).

Volpi et al. (1994) mapped the LCK gene to 1p35-p34.3 by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. By dual-color in situ hybridization with an LCK
probe and a probe for D1S57, which was mapped to 1p34.3-p34.2 by Van Roy
et al. (1993), they found that the LCK gene was telomeric to the
anonymous marker.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Goldman et al. (1998) noted that the T-cell antigen receptor plays a
crucial role in thymocyte differentiation and T-cell activation. After
antigen binding to the TCR, and in concert with engagement of other
coreceptors and their associated ligands (such as CD4 and major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, CD28 (186760), B7 (112203),
CD8, and MHC I), signal transduction cascades are activated. The
earliest measurable biochemical event is the activation of
protein-tyrosine kinases, resulting in the phosphorylation of multiple
cellular substrates. At least 3 protein-tyrosine kinases are known to be
involved in TCR signaling at the level of the receptor, including
p59(fyn) (FYN; 137025), p56(lck), and ZAP70 (176947). Individuals with
mutations in the gene coding for the ZAP70 protein show severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID), a heterogeneous disorder characterized by
profound defects in cellular and humoral immunity, due to selective
T-cell defect, e.g., 176947.0001. Patients present with an absence of
peripheral CD8(+) T cells and normal to high levels of peripheral CD4(+)
T cells which are unable to signal through the TCR. SCID-like phenotypes
have also been observed in mice rendered p56(lck) or p59(fyn) deficient
by homologous recombination. Mice lacking p56(lck) as well as transgenic
mice expressing dominant-negative mutations of p56(lck) demonstrate
severe T-cell developmental defects (Molina et al., 1992; Levin et al.,
1993).

Goldman et al. (1998) described an infant with clinical and laboratory
features of SCID and selective CD4 lymphopenia and lack of CD28
expression on CD8(+) T cells. T cells from this patient showed poor
blastogenic responses to various mitogens and to interleukin-2 (IL2;
147680). Other T-cell antigen receptor-induced responses, including
upregulation of CD69 (107273), were similarly inhibited. However, more
proximal T-cell antigen receptor signaling events, such as anti-CD3
induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of
mitogen-associated protein kinase, and calcium mobilization, were
intact. Although p59(fyn) and ZAP70 protein-tyrosine kinases were
expressed at normal levels, a marked decrease in the level of p56(lck)
was noted. Furthermore, this decrease was associated with the presence
of an alternatively spliced LCK transcript lacking the exon 7
kinase-encoding domain. These data suggested that deficiency in p56(lck)
expression can produce a SCID phenotype in humans. The patient was a
male infant from a nonconsanguineous union who was noted to have loose
stools and poor weight gain at 1 month of age. He was first hospitalized
at 2 months of age for dehydration, failure to thrive, and sepsis. Oral
candidiasis and weight below the fifth percentile were found at that
time. Rotavirus was isolated from the stool, Enterobacter cloacae from
the blood, and cytomegalovirus from the urine and intestinal biopsies.
Lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia were noted. Tests for HIV and for
other causes of SCID, including deficiencies of adenosine deaminase and
purine nucleoside phosphorylase, excluded those diagnoses. A 2-month
trial of IL2, begun when the patient was 26 months old, elicited neither
a clinical response nor an improvement in lymphocyte numbers (total
lymphocyte count ranged between 780 and 1,890). At the age of 32 months,
the patient underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant from a
matched unrelated donor. All sequences normally found in exon 7 were
absent in the patient. To test whether the skipping of exon 7 was due to
splice site mutations, intron 6, exon 7, and intron 7 were PCR amplified
from patient and control genomic DNA and then sequenced. No differences
were observed in the splice sequences flanking exon 7 or within 20 bp on
either side. The RT-PCR products generated from the patient's cDNA using
forward and reverse primers within the 5-prime and 3-prime ends of the
molecule yielded 2 bands of approximately equal intensity, whereas 1
band was barely detectable or absent when cDNA from control peripheral
blood mononuclear cells, the parents, or Jurkat cDNA was used. While the
precise genetic defect responsible for the decreased expression p56(lck)
in this patient was not fully understood, Goldman et al. (1998) thought
it likely that aberrant alternative splicing of exon 7 was responsible.

CYTOGENETICS

In a patient with T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and a translocation
t(1;7)(p34;q34) as the sole karyotypic abnormality, Tycko et al. (1991)
found evidence of joining of the LCK gene with the gene encoding the
T-cell antigen receptor beta subunit (TCRB; see 186930). The chromosomal
breakpoint was located 2 kb upstream of the LCK upstream promoter and
first nontranslated exon. In a second t(1;7) translocation, the
breakpoint was found between 2 alternative LCK promoters, upstream of
the second exon. Relative to normal thymus and activated T cells, levels
of LCK mRNA were greatly elevated in the first case and moderately
elevated in the second. Burnett et al. (1991) also studied involvement
of the LCK gene in a t(1;7) leukemia translocation.

Burnett et al. (1994) provided a molecular analysis of the
t(1;7)(p34;q34) in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that fuses LCK
and TCRB.

ANIMAL MODEL

During T-cell development, assembly and expression of a complete gene
for the beta chain of the T-cell receptor blocks further rearrangement
at the TCRB locus (a process referred to as allelic exclusion) and
drives the generation and expansion of cells positive for CD4 and CD8.
Studies in transgenic animals suggested that the lymphocyte-specific
protein-tyrosine kinase p56(lck) may impinge on the same pathway used by
TCR-beta chains to deliver such signals. This hypothesis predicts that
interference with p56(lck) function would mitigate the effects of a
simultaneously expressed TCR-beta chain. Anderson et al. (1993)
confirmed this prediction through examination of allelic exclusion in
mice expressing both a functional TCRB transgene and a catalytically
inactive form of p56(lck). Thus, the oncogene LCK is the
protein-tyrosine kinase that regulates allelic exclusion at the T-cell
receptor beta locus.

By creating a lck-knockout mouse with a doxycycline-inducible lck
transgene, Seddon et al. (2000) assessed the role of LCK in T cell
development and population of the peripheral T cell pool. Knockout mice
fed doxycycline (dox) had functional T cell phenotypes similar to those
of wildtype control mice, whereas the phenotype of knockout mice that
had dox removed from their diets (Lck1 OFF) resembled that of
Lck-negative mice. Analysis of thymic cellularity revealed a rapid
atrophy in the Lck1 OFF mice due to loss of double-positive (CD4+/CD8+)
cells. Although expression of lck is essential for full activation of
naive T cells, flow cytometric and immunoblot analyses showed that
continued expression of lck is not required for their prolonged
survival. Adoptive transfer experiments showed that homeostatic
proliferation of naive T cells does require sustained lck expression.
Therefore, the signals that mediate survival and homeostasis appear to
be distinct.

By flow cytometric analysis of mice expressing an inducible Lck
transgene in T cells, Tewari et al. (2006) found that immunologically
naive mice lacking Lck were unable to activate or expand viral
antigen-specific Cd8-positive T cells. The magnitude of primary
Cd8-positive T-cell expansion depended on the duration of Lck-dependent
signaling. Memory Cd8-positive T cells, however, did not require Lck for
functional avidity, maintenance, or reactivation. Tewari et al. (2006)
concluded that naive, but not memory, CD8-positive T cells require LCK
for activation, possibly accounting for the hyperreactivity to antigen
of memory cells and accelerated immune control during secondary
infections.

606015	TITLE *606015 FAS APOPTOTIC INHIBITORY MOLECULE 3; FAIM3
;;TOSO;;
Fc FRAGMENT OF IgM, RECEPTOR FOR; FCMR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fc receptors specifically bind to the Fc region of immunoglobulins (Igs)
to mediate the unique functions of each Ig class. FAIM3 encodes an Fc
receptor for IgM (see 147020) (Kubagawa et al., 2009; Shima et al.,
2010).

CLONING

Using retroviral cDNA library-based functional cloning, Hitoshi et al.
(1998) isolated a cDNA encoding a potent inhibitor of FAS
(134637)-induced apoptotic signaling that they named TOSO after a
Japanese liquor drunk on New Year's day to celebrate long life and
eternal youth. The predicted 390-amino acid type I integral membrane
protein has a signal peptide; an extracellular region homologous to
immunoglobulin (Ig) variable domains, but with 2 additional cysteines;
and a cytoplasmic region containing a basic region, an acidic region,
and a proline-rich region. RNA dot blot analysis detected strong
expression of TOSO in lymph node, lung, and kidney. Northern blot
analysis detected a major 2.0-kb TOSO transcript, as well as minor
transcripts of 2.8, 3.5, and 4.3 kb, in lymph node, spleen, peripheral
blood leukocytes, and thymus. RT-PCR analysis detected TOSO expression
in lymphoid cell lines, but not in nonhemopoietic cell lines.

By retroviral expression and functional cloning using cDNA libraries
from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia line and from a pre-B cell line,
followed by screening for IgM (see 147020) binding and flow cytometric
enrichment, Kubagawa et al. (2009) obtained a cDNA encoding FAIM3, which
they called FCMR. SDS-PAGE, RT-PCR, and FACS analyses showed that FCMR
had an apparent molecular mass of 60 kD and was predominantly expressed
on B and T lymphocytes.

By searching EST databases for molecules containing Ig domains similar
to those of FCAMR (605484) and PIGR (173880), Shima et al. (2010)
identified FAIM3, which they called FCMR, as a possible Fc receptor for
IgM. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses revealed FCMR expression
predominantly in lymphocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

FAS engagement by FAS ligand (FASL; 134638) activates cysteine
proteases, or caspases, through an association with FADD (602457),
resulting in cell death. Newly activated T cells, however, express both
FAS and FASL, but remain resistant to apoptosis. Using Northern blot
analysis, Hitoshi et al. (1998) demonstrated that expression of TOSO,
like that of FAS and FASL, increased after T-cell activation, followed
by a decline and susceptibility to apoptosis. Functional analysis showed
that hematopoietic cells expressing TOSO resisted anti-FAS-, FADD-, and
TNF-induced apoptosis without increasing expression of the inhibitors of
apoptosis BCL2 (151430) and BCLXL (600039). RT-PCR analysis indicated
that cells expressing TOSO and activated by FAS had reduced FLICE
(CASP8; 601763) and increased FLIP (CFLAR; 603599) expression, which
inhibited CASP8 processing. Mutational analysis established that the Ig
domain and transmembrane region of TOSO, but not the cytoplasmic domain,
were required for the inhibition of FAS-induced apoptosis. Hitoshi et
al. (1998) concluded that the transient increase in TOSO expression is
responsible for temporary FAS resistance in T cells.

Through functional analysis, Kubagawa et al. (2009) confirmed that FCMR
had binding specificity for IgM, but not other immunoglobulins, and that
only under some conditions did FCMR have antiapoptotic activity.
Kubagawa et al. (2009) concluded that FCMR per se has no inhibitory
activity in FAS-mediated apoptosis, and that such inhibition can only be
achieved with anti-FAS antibodies of IgM, but not IgG (see 147100),
isotype.

Shima et al. (2010) found that transfection of FCMR into HeLa cells
allowed IgM, but not IgG, binding. They concluded that FCMR is a
receptor for IgM that may serve as an uptake receptor for IgM-opsonized
antigens by B cells.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Hitoshi et al. (1998) mapped the FAIM3
gene to chromosome 1q31-q32, a region with frequent changes in
hemopoietic malignancies and solid tumors. Kubagawa et al. (2009) noted
that the FAIM3 gene is located on chromosome 1q32.2, adjacent to 2 other
genes encoding IgM-binding receptors, PIGR and FCAMR.

604753	TITLE *604753 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 268; ZNF268
;;HZF3
DESCRIPTION Zinc finger proteins have been shown to interact with nucleic acids and
to have diverse functions. The zinc finger domain is a conserved amino
acid sequence motif containing 2 specifically positioned cysteines and 2
histidines that are involved in coordinating zinc. Kruppel-related
proteins form 1 family of zinc finger proteins. See ZFP93 (604749) for
additional information on zinc finger proteins.

By screening a human monoblast cell line (U-937) cDNA library with a
degenerate oligonucleotide based on a conserved region of
Kruppel-related zinc finger proteins that encompasses the H/C link,
Abrink et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs encoding 42 distinct Kruppel-related
zinc finger proteins, including ZNF268, which they called HZF3. Northern
blot analysis detected a major 5.0-kb ZNF268 transcript in HeLa cells,
U-937 cells, and PMA-induced U-937 cells.

Using a differential hybridization strategy, Gou et al. (2001) isolated
a cDNA corresponding to a novel zinc finger gene, designated ZNF268,
from a 3-week-old human embryo cDNA library. The full-length cDNA
encodes a 947-amino acid protein with an N-terminal Kruppel-associated
box (KRAB) domain and 24 C-terminal zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression of a ZNF268 transcript in 3- to 5-week-old
human embryos and lower expression in colon, heart, and 2-month-old
fetuses. No signal was detected in other tissues tested.

Gou et al. (2001) determined that the ZNF268 gene contains 6 exons
spanning about 22 kb of genomic DNA. They identified the ZNF268 sequence
within a cosmid that maps to chromosome 5 (GenBank GENBANK AC026786).

611859	TITLE *611859 MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L55; MRPL55
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Mitochondria have their own translation system for production of 13
inner membrane proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. MRPL55
is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome that
is encoded by the nuclear genome (Koc et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching databases using bovine Mrpl55 as query, Koc et al. (2001)
identified human MRPL55. They also identified MRPL55 homologs in mouse,
Drosophila, and C. elegans, but not in yeast, E. coli, or Arabidopsis.
Mouse and human MRPL55 share 71.7% amino acid identity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MRPL55 gene to chromosome 1q42.13 based on an
alignment of the MRPL55 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY358771) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

150330	TITLE *150330 LAMIN A/C; LMNA
;;LAMIN A;;
LAMIN C; LMNC
PRELAMIN A, INCLUDED;;
PROGERIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LMNA gene encodes lamin A and lamin C. Lamins are structural protein
components of the nuclear lamina, a protein network underlying the inner
nuclear membrane that determines nuclear shape and size. The lamins
constitute a class of intermediate filaments. Three types of lamins, A,
B (see LMNB1; 150340), and C, have been described in mammalian cells
(Fisher et al., 1986).

CLONING

By screening human fibroblast and hepatoma cDNA libraries, Fisher et al.
(1986) isolated cDNAs corresponding to lamin A and lamin C. The lamin A
and C proteins are predicted to have molecular masses of 74 kD and 65
kD, respectively. Fisher et al. (1986) and McKeon et al. (1986) found
that the deduced amino acid sequences from cDNA clones of human lamin A
and C are identical for the first 566 amino acids, but that lamin A
contains an extra 98 amino acids (corresponding to approximately 9 kD)
at the C terminus. Lamin C has 6 unique C-terminal amino acids. Both
lamins A and C contain a 360-residue alpha-helical domain with homology
to a corresponding alpha-helical rod domain that is the structural
hallmark of all intermediate filament proteins. Fisher et al. (1986) and
McKeon et al. (1986) concluded that lamin A and lamin C arise by
alternative splicing from the same gene.

Guilly et al. (1987) detected a 3-kb lamin A mRNA and a 2.1-kb lamin C
mRNA in epithelial HeLa cells, but not in T lymphoblasts. Lamin B was
the only lamin present in T lymphoblasts. Guilly et al. (1987) noted
that the transport of newly synthesized proteins from the cytoplasm into
the nucleus differs from the transport of proteins into other
organelles, such as mitochondria, in that sequences are not cleaved and
remain a permanent feature of the mature polypeptide. Lamin A appears to
be an exception to this rule.

Weber et al. (1989) showed that lamin A is synthesized as a precursor
molecule called prelamin A. Maturation of lamin A involves the removal
of 18 residues from the C terminus, which is accomplished by
isoprenylation and farnesylation involving a C-terminal CAAX
(cysteine-aliphatic-aliphatic-any amino acid) box (Sinensky et al.,
1994).

GENE STRUCTURE

Lin and Worman (1993) demonstrated that the coding region of the lamin
A/C gene spans approximately 24 kb and contains 12 exons. Alternative
splicing within exon 10 gives rise to 2 different mRNAs that code for
prelamin A and lamin C.

MAPPING

Wydner et al. (1996) mapped the LMNA gene to chromosome 1q21.2-q21.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Gross (2013) mapped the LMNA gene to chromosome 1q22 based on an
alignment of the LMNA sequence (GenBank GENBANK AY847595) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Lloyd et al. (2002) identified proteins interacting with the C-terminal
domain of lamin A by screening a mouse 3T3-L1 adipocyte library in a
yeast 2-hybrid interaction screen. Using this approach, the adipocyte
differentiation factor SREBP1 (184756) was identified as a novel lamin A
interactor. In vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down and in vivo
coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed an interaction between lamin A
and both SREBP1a and 1c. A binding site for lamin A was identified in
the N-terminal transcription factor domain of SREBP1, between residues
227 and 487. The binding of lamin A to SREBP1 was noticeably reduced by
FPLD mutations. The authors speculated that fat loss seen in
laminopathies may be caused in part by reduced binding of the adipocyte
differentiation factor SREBP1 to lamin A.

Favreau et al. (2004) analyzed myoblast-to-myotube differentiation in a
mouse myogenic cell line overexpressing wildtype or mutant human lamin
A. In contrast to clones overexpressing wildtype lamin A, those
expressing lamin A with the R453W mutation (150330.0002) differentiated
poorly or not at all, did not exit the cell cycle properly, and were
extensively committed to apoptosis. Clones expressing the R482W mutation
(150330.0011) differentiated normally. Favreau et al. (2004) concluded
that lamin A mutated at arginine-453 fails to build a functional
scaffold and/or fails to maintain the chromatin compartmentation
required for differentiation of myoblasts into myocytes.

Using a novel technique to measure nuclear deformation in response to
biaxial strain applied to cells, Lammerding et al. (2004) found that
Lmna -/- cells showed increased nuclear deformation, defective
mechanotransduction, and impaired viability under mechanical strain
compared to wildtype cells. In addition, activity of nuclear
factor-kappa-B (NFKB; 164011), a mechanical stress-responsive
transcription factor that can act as an antiapoptotic signal, was
impaired in the Lmna -/- cells. The findings suggested that lamin A/C
deficiency is associated with both defective nuclear mechanics and
impaired transcriptional activation.

Broers et al. (2004) used a cell compression device to compare wildtype
and Lmna-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and found that Lmna-null
cells showed significantly decreased mechanical stiffness and
significantly lower bursting force. Partial rescue of the phenotype by
transfection with either lamin A or lamin C prevented gross nuclear
disruption, but was unable to fully restore mechanical stiffness.
Confocal microscopy revealed that the nuclei of Lmna-null cells
exhibited an isotropic deformation upon indentation, despite an
anisotropic deformation of the cell as a whole. This nuclear behavior
suggested a loss of interaction of the disturbed nucleus with the
surrounding cytoskeleton. Actin-(102610), vimentin-(193060), and
tubulin-(191110) based filaments showed disturbed interaction in
Lmna-null cells. Broers et al. (2004) suggested that in addition to the
loss of nuclear stiffness, the loss of a physical interaction between
nuclear structures (i.e., lamins) and the cytoskeleton may cause more
general cellular weakness; they proposed a potential key function for
lamins in maintaining cellular tensegrity.

Van Berlo et al. (2005) showed that A-type lamins were essential for the
inhibition of fibroblast proliferation by TGF-beta-1 (190180).
TGF-beta-1 dephosphorylated RB1 (614041) through protein phosphatase 2A
(PPP2CA; 176915), both of which were associated with lamin A/C. In
addition, lamin A/C modulated the effect of TGF-beta-1 on collagen
production, a marker of mesenchymal differentiation. Van Berlo et al.
(2005) proposed a role for lamin A/C in control of gene activity
downstream of TGF-beta-1, via nuclear phosphatases such as PPP2CA.

Capanni et al. (2005) showed that the lamin A precursor was specifically
accumulated in lipodystrophy cells. Pre-lamin A was located at the
nuclear envelope and colocalized with SREBP1 Binding of SREBP1 to the
lamin A precursor was detected in patient fibroblasts, as well as in
control fibroblasts, forced to accumulate pre-lamin A by farnesylation
inhibitors. In contrast, SREBP1 did not interact in vivo with mature
lamin A or C in cultured fibroblasts. Inhibition of lamin A precursor
processing in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes resulted in sequestration of SREBP1
at the nuclear rim, thus decreasing the pool of active SREBP1 that
normally activates PPAR-gamma (601487) and causing impairment of
preadipocyte differentiation. This defect could be rescued by treatment
with troglitazone, a known PPAR-gamma ligand activating the adipogenic
program.

Scaffidi and Misteli (2006) showed that the same molecular mechanism
responsible for Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS; 176670) is
active in healthy cells. Cell nuclei from old individuals acquire
defects similar to those of HGPS patient cells, including changes in
histone modifications and increased DNA damage. Age-related nuclear
defects are caused by sporadic use, in healthy individuals, of the same
cryptic splice site in lamin A whose constitutive activation causes
HGPS. Inhibition of this splice site reverses the nuclear defects
associated with aging. Scaffidi and Misteli (2006) concluded that their
observations implicate lamin A in physiologic aging.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (see 609423) protease inhibitors
(PIs) targeting the viral aspartyl protease are a cornerstone of
treatment for HIV infection and disease, but they are associated with
lipodystrophy and other side effects. Coffinier et al. (2007) found that
treatment of human and mouse fibroblasts with HIV-PIs caused an
accumulation of prelamin A. The prelamin A in HIV-PI-treated fibroblasts
migrated more rapidly than nonfarnesylated prelamin A, comigrating with
the farnesylated form found in ZMPSTE24 (606480)-deficient fibroblasts.
HIV-PI-treated heterozygous ZMPSTE24 fibroblasts exhibited an
exaggerated accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A. Western blot and
enzymatic analysis showed that HIV-PIs inhibited ZMPSTE24 activity and
endoproteolytic processing of a GFP-prelamin A fusion protein, but they
did not affect farnesylation of HDJ2 (DNAJA1; 602837) or activity of
farnesyltransferase (see 134635), ICMT (605851), and RCE1 (605385) in
vitro. Coffinier et al. (2007) concluded that HIV-PIs inhibit ZMPSTE24,
leading to an accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A, possibly explaining
HIV-PI side effects.

The nuclear envelope LINC (links the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton)
complex, which is formed by SUN (e.g., SUN1, 607723) and nesprin (e.g.,
SYNE1, 608441) proteins, provides a direct connection between the
nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton. Haque et al. (2010) stated that
SUN1 and SUN2 interact with LMNA and that LMNA is required for the
nuclear envelope localization of SUN2, but not SUN1. They found that
LMNA mutations associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD2;
181350) and HGPS disrupted interaction of LMNA with mouse Sun1 and human
SUN2. Nuclear localization of SUN1 and SUN2 was not impaired in EDMD2 or
HGPS cell lines. Expression of SUN1, but not SUN2, at the nuclear
envelope was enhanced in some HGPS cells, likely due to increased
interaction of SUN1 with accumulated prelamin A. Haque et al. (2010)
proposed that different perturbations in LMNA-SUN protein interactions
may underlie the opposing effects of EDMD and HGPS mutations on nuclear
and cellular mechanics.

Liu et al. (2011) reported the generation of induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts obtained from patients with HGPS. HGPS
iPSCs showed absence of progerin, and more importantly, lacked the
nuclear envelope and epigenetic alterations normally associated with
premature aging. Upon differentiation of HGPS iPSCs, progerin and its
aging-associated phenotypic consequences were restored. Specifically,
directed differentiation of HGPS iPSCs to vascular smooth muscle cells
led to the appearance of premature senescence phenotypes associated with
vascular aging. Additionally, their studies identified DNA-dependent
protein kinase catalytic subunit (PRKDC; 600899) as a downstream target
of progerin. The absence of nuclear PRKDC holoenzyme correlated with
premature as well as physiologic aging. Because progerin also
accumulates during physiologic aging, Liu et al. (2011) argued that
their results provided an in vitro iPSC-based model to study the
pathogenesis of human premature and physiologic vascular aging.

Chen et al. (2012) showed that cells from Lmna -/- mice, which represent
EDMD2, cells from Lmna(L530P/L530P) mice, which represent HGPS, and
cells from HGPS patients all had overaccumulation of the inner nuclear
envelope SUN1 protein. In wildtype cells, Lmna and Sun1 colocalized at
the nuclear envelope. In Lmna -/- cells, larger amounts of Sun1 were
found at the nuclear envelope and also in the Golgi. The larger amounts
of Sun1 appeared to result from reduced protein turnover. Transfection
of increasing amounts of mouse Sun1 into Lmna-null/Sun1-null murine
cells resulted in increased prevalence of nuclear herniations and
apoptosis, and the herniations appeared to result from Sun1 accumulation
in the Golgi. Loss of the Sun1 gene in both mouse models extensively
rescued cellular, tissue, organ, and lifespan abnormalities. Similarly,
knockdown of overaccumulated SUN1 protein in primary human HGPS cells
corrected nuclear defects and cellular senescence. The findings
indicated that accumulation of SUN1 is a common pathogenetic event in
these disorders.

In mice, Ho et al. (2013) found that lamin A/C-deficient (Lmna-null) and
Lmna(N195K/N195K) (see 150330.0007) mutant cells have impaired nuclear
translocation and downstream signaling of the mechanosensitive
transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1; 606078), a
myocardin family member that is pivotal in cardiac development and
function. Altered nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of MKL1 was caused by
altered actin dynamics in Lmna-null and Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells.
Ectopic expression of the nuclear envelope protein emerin (300384),
which is mislocalized in Lmna mutant cells and also linked to
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300) and dilated cardiomyopathy,
restored MKL1 nuclear translocation and rescued actin dynamics in mutant
cells. Ho et al. (2013) concluded that their findings presented a novel
mechanism that could provide insight into the disease etiology for the
cardiac phenotype in many laminopathies, whereby lamin A/C and emerin
regulate gene expression through modulation of nuclear and cytoskeletal
actin polymerization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutations in the LMNA gene cause a wide range of human diseases. Since
more than 10 different clinical syndromes have been attributed to LMNA
mutations, many of which show overlapping features, attempts at broad
classification have been proposed. Worman and Bonne (2007) suggested
that the disorders may be classified into 4 major types: diseases of
striated and cardiac muscle; lipodystrophy syndromes; peripheral
neuropathy; and premature aging. Benedetti et al. (2007) suggested 2
main groups: (1) neuromuscular and cardiac disorders, and (2)
lipodystrophy and premature aging disorders. The phenotypic
heterogeneity of diseases resulting from a mutation in a single gene can
be explained by the numerous roles of the nuclear lamina, including
maintenance of nuclear shape and structure, as well as functional roles
in transcriptional regulation and heterochromatin organization (review
by Capell and Collins, 2006).

Genschel and Schmidt (2000) compiled a list of 41 known mutations,
predominantly missense, in the LMNA gene. Twenty-three different
mutations had been shown to cause autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss
muscular dystrophy (EDMD2; 181350). Three mutations had been reported to
cause autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD1B;
159001), 8 mutations were known to result in dilated cardiomyopathy
(CMD1A; 115200), and 7 mutations were reported to cause familial partial
lipodystrophy (FPLD2; 151660). In addition, 1 mutation in LMNA (H222Y;
150330.0014) appeared to be responsible for an autosomal recessive,
atypical form of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD3; see 181350).

- Muscular Dystrophies

In 5 families with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(EDMD2; 181350), Bonne et al. (1999) identified 4 mutations in the LMNA
gene (150330.0001-150330.0004) that cosegregated with the disease
phenotype. These findings represented the first identification of
mutations in a component of the nuclear lamina as a cause of an
inherited muscle disorder. The authors noted that lamins interact with
integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane, including emerin
(300384), which is mutated in the X-linked form of Emery-Dreifuss
muscular dystrophy (EDMD1; 310300).

Raffaele di Barletta et al. (2000) showed that heterozygous mutations in
LMNA may cause diverse phenotypes ranging from typical EDMD to no
phenotypic effect. LMNA mutations in patients with autosomal dominant
EDMD occur in the tail and in the 2A rod domain of the protein,
suggesting that unique interactions between lamin A/C and other nuclear
components have an important role in cardiac and skeletal muscle
function. They identified a homozygous LMNA mutation (H222Y;
150330.0014) in 1 patient born of consanguineous unaffected parents,
consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance and a severe atypical
phenotype lacking cardiac features.

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (LGMD1B; 159001) is an autosomal
dominant, slowly progressive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy with
age-related atrioventricular cardiac conduction disturbances and the
absence of early contractures. Muchir et al. (2000) found mutations in
the LMNA gene in 3 LGMD1B families: a missense mutation (150330.0017), a
deletion of a codon (150330.0018), and a splice donor site mutation
(150330.0019). The 3 mutations were identified in all affected members
of the corresponding families and were absent in 100 unrelated control
subjects.

Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) described a form of congenital muscular
dystrophy (MDC) with onset in the first year of life in 15 children
resulting from de novo heterozygous mutations in the LMNA gene (see,
e.g., 150330.0047-150330.0049). Three patients had severe early-onset
disease, with decreased fetal movements in utero, no motor development,
severe hypotonia, diffuse limb and axial muscle weakness and atrophy,
and talipes foot deformities. The remaining 12 children initially
acquired head and trunk control and independent ambulation, but most
lost head control due to neck extensor weakness, a phenotype consistent
with 'dropped head syndrome.' Ten children required ventilatory support.
Cardiac arrhythmias were observed in 4 of the oldest patients, but were
symptomatic only in 1. Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) concluded that the
identified LMNA mutations appeared to correlate with a relatively severe
phenotype, broadening the spectrum of laminopathies. The authors
suggested that this group of patients may define a new disease entity,
which they designated LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy
(613205).

Benedetti et al. (2007) reported 27 individuals with mutations in the
LMNA gene resulting in a wide range of neuromuscular disorders.
Phenotypic analysis yielded 2 broad groups of patients. One group
included patients with childhood onset who had skeletal muscle
involvement with predominant scapuloperoneal and facial weakness,
consistent with EDMD or congenital muscular dystrophy. The second group
included patients with later or adult onset who had cardiac disorders or
a limb-girdle myopathy, consistent with LGMD1B. Those in the group with
early onset tended to have missense mutations, whereas those in the
group with adult onset tended to have truncating mutations. Analysis of
the variants showed that those associated with early-onset phenotypes
were primarily found in the Ig-like domain and in coil 2A, which may
interfere with binding to specific ligands. Those associated with later
onset were mostly located in the rod domain and in coil 2B, which was
predicted to affect the surface of lamin A/C dimers and lead to impaired
filament assembly. Benedetti et al. (2007) speculated that there may be
2 different pathogenetic mechanisms associated with neuromuscular
LMNA-related disorders: late-onset phenotypes may arise through loss of
LMNA function secondary to haploinsufficiency, whereas dominant-negative
or toxic gain-of-function mechanisms may underlie the more severe early
phenotypes.

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Cardiac Conduction Defects

Fatkin et al. (1999) studied the LMNA gene in 11 families with autosomal
dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease (CMD1A;
115200) linked to a region on chromosome 1 overlapping that of the LMNA
gene. They identified 5 novel missense mutations
(150330.0004-150330.0009): 4 in the alpha-helical rod domain of lamin A,
and 1 in the tail domain of lamin C. No family members with mutations
had joint contractures or skeletal myopathy characteristic of autosomal
dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, serum creatine
kinase levels were normal in family members with mutations of the lamin
A rod domain, but mildly elevated in some family members with a defect
in the lamin C tail domain. The authors noted that mutations in the rod
domain of the protein led to dilated cardiomyopathy, whereas mutations
in the head or tail domain caused Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

Van der Kooi et al. (2002) reported a sporadic patient and 2 unrelated
families with mutations in the LMNA gene who presented with varying
degrees and combinations of muscular dystrophy, partial lipodystrophy,
and cardiomyopathy with conduction defects, presumably due to single
mutations (see 150330.0003 and 150330.0005).

Sebillon et al. (2003) screened the coding sequence of LMNA in DNA
samples from 66 index cases of dilated cardiomyopathy with or without
associated features. They identified a glu161-to-lys mutation (E161K;
150330.0028) in a family with early-onset atrial fibrillation preceding
or coexisting with dilated cardiomyopathy, the previously described
R377H mutation (150330.0017) in the family with quadriceps myopathy
associated with dilated cardiomyopathy previously reported by Charniot
et al. (2003), and a 28insA mutation (150330.0029) leading to a
premature stop codon in a third family with dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects. No mutation in LMNA was found in cases with isolated
dilated cardiomyopathy.

Meune et al. (2006) investigated the efficacy of implantable
cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in the primary prevention of sudden
death in patients with cardiomyopathy due to lamin A/C gene mutations.
Patients referred for permanent cardiac pacing were systematically
offered the implantation of an ICD. The patients were enrolled solely on
the basis of the presence of lamin A/C mutations associated with cardiac
conduction defects. Indications for pacemaker implantation were
progressive conduction block and sinus block. In all, 19 patients were
treated. Meune et al. (2006) concluded that ICD implantation in patients
with lamin A/C mutations who are in need of a pacemaker is effective in
treating possibly lethal tachyarrhythmias, and that implantation of an
ICD, rather than a pacemaker, should be considered for such patients.

Taylor et al. (2003) screened the LMNA gene in 40 families and 9
sporadic patients with CMD with or without muscular dystrophy and
identified mutations in 3 families (see, e.g., 150330.0017) and 1
sporadic patient (S573L; 150330.0041). All mutations involved a
conserved residue, cosegregated with the disease within the families,
and were not found in 300 control chromosomes. LMNA mutation carriers
had a severe and progressive form of CMD with significantly poorer
cumulative survival compared to noncarrier CMD patients.

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism

In a 17-year-old Caucasian female with premature ovarian failure and
dilated cardiomyopathy, who had features consistent with atypical Werner
syndrome (see 277700) but who was negative for mutation in the RECQL2
gene (604611), Nguyen et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a
missense mutation in the LMNA gene (L59R; 150330.0052). The authors
suggested the diagnosis of a laminopathy, most likely an atypical form
of mandibuloacral dysplasia (see 248370).

In a 15-year-old Caucasian girl with premature ovarian failure and
dilated cardiomyopathy, McPherson et al. (2009) identified
heterozygosity for the L59R mutation in the LMNA gene. McPherson et al.
(2009) noted phenotypic similarities between this patient and the
patient previously reported by Nguyen et al. (2007), who carried the
same mutation, as well as a patient originally described by Chen et al.
(2003) with an adjacent A57P mutation in LMNA (150330.0030). Features
common to these 3 patients included premature ovarian failure, dilated
cardiomyopathy, lipodystrophy, and progressive facial and skeletal
changes involving micrognathia and sloping shoulders, but not
acroosteolysis. Although the appearance of these patients was somewhat
progeroid, none had severe growth failure, alopecia, or rapidly
progressive atherosclerosis, and McPherson et al. (2009) suggested that
the phenotype represents a distinct laminopathy involving dilated
cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (212112).

- Lipodystrophy Disorders

Patients with Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy, or partial
lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2; 151660), are born with normal fat
distribution, but after puberty experience regional and progressive
adipocyte degeneration, often associated with profound insulin
resistance and diabetes. Cao and Hegele (2000) hypothesized that the
analogy between the regional muscle wasting in autosomal dominant
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and the regional adipocyte
degeneration in FPLD, in addition to the chromosomal localization of the
FPLD2 locus on 1q21-q22, made LMNA a good candidate gene for FPLD2.
Studies of 5 Canadian probands with familial partial lipodystrophy of
Dunnigan type indicated that each had a novel missense mutation (R482Q;
150330.0010) that cosegregated with the lipodystrophy phenotype and was
absent from 2,000 normal alleles.

Shackleton et al. (2000) identified 5 different missense mutations in
the LMNA gene (see, e.g., 150330.0010-150330.0012) among 10 kindreds and
3 individuals with partial lipodystrophy. All of the mutations occurred
in exon 8, which the authors noted is within the C-terminal globular
domain of lamin A/C. Flier (2000) commented on the significance of LMNA
mutations in partial lipodystrophy.

Vantyghem et al. (2004) characterized the neuromuscular and cardiac
phenotypes of FPLD patients bearing the heterozygous R482W mutation.
Fourteen patients from 2 unrelated families, including 10 affected
subjects, were studied. Clinical and histologic examination showed an
incapacitating, progressive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in a
42-year-old woman that had been present since childhood, associated with
a typical postpubertal FPLD phenotype. Six of 8 adults presented the
association of calf hypertrophy, perihumeral muscular atrophy, and a
rolling gait due to proximal lower limb weakness. Muscular histology was
compatible with muscular dystrophy in one of them and/or showed a
nonspecific excess of lipid droplets (in 3 cases). Cardiac septal
hypertrophy and atherosclerosis were frequent in FPLD patients. In
addition, a 24-year-old FPLD patient had a symptomatic second-degree
atrioventricular block. Vantyghem et al. (2004) concluded that most
lipodystrophic patients affected by the FPLD-linked R482W mutation show
muscular and cardiac abnormalities.

Mandibuloacral dysplasia (see 248370) is a rare autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by postnatal growth retardation, craniofacial
anomalies, skeletal malformations, and mottled cutaneous pigmentation.
Patients with MAD frequently have partial lipodystrophy and insulin
resistance, which are features seen in FPLD. In all affected members of
5 consanguineous Italian families with MAD, Novelli et al. (2002)
identified a homozygous missense mutation (R527H; 150330.0021) in the
LMNA gene. Patient skin fibroblasts showed nuclei that presented
abnormal lamin A/C distribution and a dysmorphic envelope, demonstrating
the pathogenic effect of the mutation.

In affected members of a consanguineous family from north India,
Plasilova et al. (2004) identified a homozygous missense mutation in the
LMNA gene (150330.0033). The extent of skeletal lesions in this family
were consistent with MAD, but affected individuals also had classic
features of progeria. Plasilova et al. (2004) suggested that autosomal
recessive HGPS and mandibuloacral dysplasia may represent a single
disorder with varying degrees of disease severity.

Decaudain et al. (2007) identified changes in codon 482 of the LMNA gene
(see, e.g., R482Q 150330.0010 and R482W; 150330.0011) in 17 of 277
unrelated adults investigated for lipodystrophy and/or insulin
resistance. All 17 had classic features of FPLD2. Ten additional
patients who fulfilled the International Diabetes Federation diagnostic
criteria for metabolic syndrome were found to have heterozygous LMNA
mutations that were not in codon 482, but affected all 3 domains of the
protein, the N terminal, central rod domain, and C terminal globulin
domain (see, e.g., R399C; 150330.0043). Because the phenotype of these
patients was not typical of FPLD2, the diagnosis of laminopathy was
delayed. Although lipodystrophy was less severe than in typical FPLD2,
common features included calf hypertrophy, myalgia, and muscle cramps or
weakness. Two patients had cardiac conduction disturbances. Metabolic
alterations were prominent, especially insulin resistance and
hypertriglyceridemia.

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2B1

In affected members of inbred Algerian families with an axonal form of
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease linked to chromosome 1q21.2-q21.3 (CMT2B1;
605588), De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2002) found a shared common
homozygous ancestral haplotype that was suggestive of a founder mutation
and identified a unique mutation in the LMNA rod domain (R298C;
150330.0020). Ultrastructural studies of sciatic nerves of Lmna-null
mice showed a strong reduction of axon density, axonal enlargement, and
the presence of nonmyelinated axons, all of which were highly similar to
the phenotypes of human peripheral axonopathies.

- Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Other Premature
Aging Syndromes

Eriksson et al. (2003) identified de novo heterozygous point mutations
in lamin A that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS;
176670). Eighteen of 20 classic cases of HGPS harbored the identical de
novo single-base substitution resulting in a silent gly-to-gly change at
codon 608 within exon 11 (150330.0022). This change creates an exonic
consensus splice site and activates cryptic splicing, leading to
deletion of 50 codons at the end of prelamin A. This prelamin A still
retains the CAAX box but lacks the site for endoproteolytic cleavage.
Eriksson et al. (2003) suggested that there is at least 1 site for
phosphorylation, ser625, that is deleted in the abnormal lamin A
protein. De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2003) independently identified the
heterozygous exon 11 cryptic splice site activation mutation
(1824C-T+1819-1968del; 150330.0022) in 2 HGPS patients. Later cellular
studies (Capell et al., 2005; Glynn and Glover, 2005; Toth et al., 2005)
indicated that Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome results from the
production of a truncated prelamin A, called progerin, which is
farnesylated at its C terminus and accumulates at the nuclear envelope,
causing misshapen nuclei (Yang et al., 2006).

Werner syndrome (277700) is an autosomal recessive progeroid syndrome
caused by mutation in the RECQL2 gene (WRN; 604611). Chen et al. (2003)
reported that of 129 index patients referred to their international
registry for molecular diagnosis of Werner syndrome, 26 (20%) had
wildtype RECQL2 coding regions and were categorized as having 'atypical
Werner syndrome' or 'non-WRN' on the basis of molecular criteria.
Because of some phenotypic similarities between Werner syndrome and
laminopathies including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, Chen et al. (2003)
sequenced all exons of the LMNA gene in these 26 individuals and found
heterozygosity for novel missense mutations in LMNA in 4 (15%): A57P
(150330.0030), R133L (150330.0027) in 2 persons, and L140R
(150330.0031). Hegele (2003) stated that the clinical designation of
Werner syndrome for each of the 4 patients of Chen et al. (2003), in
whom mutations in the LMNA gene were found, appeared somewhat insecure.
He noted that the comparatively young ages of onset in the patients with
mutant LMNA would be just as consistent with late-onset
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome as with early-onset Werner syndrome.
Patients with so-called atypical Werner syndrome and mutant LMNA also
expressed components of nonprogeroid laminopathies. Hegele (2003)
suggested that genomic DNA analysis can help draw a diagnostic line that
clarifies potential overlap between older patients with
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome and younger patients with Werner syndrome,
and that therapies may depend on precise molecular classification.

McPherson et al. (2009) suggested that the patient in whom Chen et al.
(2003) identified an A57P LMNA mutation had a distinct phenotype
involving dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism
(212112).

Csoka et al. (2004) screened 13 cell lines from atypical progeroid
patients for mutation in the LMNA gene. They identified 3 novel
heterozygous missense mutations in the LMNA gene in 3 patients: a
13-year-old female with a progeroid syndrome, a 15-year-old male with a
lipodystrophy, and a 20-year-old male with 'atypical progeria.' The
mutations identified in the last 2 patients were the most 5-prime and
3-prime missense mutations, respectively, in LMNA identified to that
time.

Reddel and Weiss (2004) reported that transcription efficiencies of the
mutant and wildtype LMNA alleles were equivalent in HGPS. The mutant
allele gave 2 types of transcripts that encoded truncated and normal
lamin A. Abnormally spliced progerin transcript constituted the majority
(84.5%) of the total steady-state mRNA derived from the mutant allele.
The abnormally spliced progerin transcript was a minority (40%) of all
lamin A transcripts obtained from both alleles. Reddel and Weiss (2004)
concluded that the mutated progerin functions as a dominant negative by
interfering with the structure of the nuclear lamina, intranuclear
architecture, and macromolecular interactions, which collectively would
have a major impact on nuclear function.

Fibroblasts from individuals with HGPS have severe morphologic
abnormalities in nuclear envelope structure. Scaffidi and Misteli (2005)
showed that the cellular disease phenotype is reversible in cells from
individuals with HGPS. Introduction of wildtype lamin A protein did not
rescue the cellular disease manifestations. The mutant LMNA mRNA and
lamin A protein could be efficiently eliminated by correction of the
aberrant splicing event using a modified oligonucleotide targeted to the
activated cryptic splice site. Upon splicing correction, HGPS
fibroblasts assumed normal nuclear morphology, the aberrant nuclear
distribution and cellular levels of lamina-associated proteins were
rescued, defects in heterochromatin-specific histone modifications were
corrected, and proper expression of several misregulated genes was
reestablished. The results established proof of principle for the
correction of the premature aging phenotype in individuals with HGPS.

Huang et al. (2005) designed short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting
mutated pre-spliced or mature LMNA mRNAs and expressed them in HGPS
fibroblasts carrying the 1824C-T mutation (150330.0022). One of the
shRNAs reduced the expression levels of mutant lamin A (so-called LA
delta-50) to 26% or lower. The reduced expression was associated with
amelioration of abnormal nuclear morphology, improvement of
proliferative potential, and reduction in the numbers of senescent
cells.

Moulson et al. (2007) reported 2 unrelated patients with extremely
severe forms of HGPS associated with unusual mutations in the LMNA gene
(150330.0036 and 150330.0040, respectively). Both mutations resulted in
increased use of the cryptic exon 11 donor splice site that is also
observed with the common 1824C-T mutation (150330.0022). As a
consequence, the ratios of mutant progerin mRNA and protein to wildtype
were higher than in typical HGPS patients. The findings indicated that
the level of progerin expression correlates with severity of disease.

Scaffidi and Misteli (2008) found that progerin (150330.0022) expression
in immortalized human skin fibroblasts produced several defects typical
of HGPS. Progerin also caused the spontaneous differentiation of human
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into endothelial cells, and reduced their
differentiation along the adipogenic lineage. Abnormal differentiation
of MSCs appeared to be due to progerin-induced activation of major
downstream effectors of the Notch signaling pathway, including HES1
(139605), HES5 (607348), and HEY1 (602953). Scaffidi and Misteli (2008)
noted that the progerin splice variant of LMNA is present at low levels
in cells from healthy individuals and has been implicated in the normal
aging process. They suggested that progerin-induced defects in Notch
signaling are involved in normal aging and similarly affect adult MSCs
and their differentiation.

- Restrictive Dermopathy

In 2 of 9 fetuses with restrictive dermopathy (275210), a lethal
genodermatosis in which tautness of the skin causes fetal akinesia or
hypokinesia deformation sequence, Navarro et al. (2004) identified
heterozygous splicing mutations in the LMNA gene, resulting in the
complete or partial loss of exon 11 (150330.0036 and 150330.0022,
respectively). In the other 7 patients, they identified a heterozygous
1-bp insertion resulting in a premature stop codon in the zinc
metalloproteinase STE24 gene (ZMPSTE24; 606480). This gene encodes a
metalloproteinase specifically involved in the posttranslational
processing of lamin A precursor. In all patients carrying a ZMPSTE24
mutation, loss of expression of lamin A as well as abnormal patterns of
nuclear sizes and shapes and mislocalization of lamin-associated
proteins was seen. Navarro et al. (2004) concluded that a common
pathogenetic pathway, involving defects of the nuclear lamina and
matrix, is involved in restrictive dermopathy.

Navarro et al. (2005) described 7 previously reported patients and 3 new
patients with restrictive dermopathy who were homozygous or compound
heterozygous for ZMPSTE24 mutations. In all cases there was complete
absence of both ZMPSTE24 and mature lamin A, associated with prelamin A
accumulation. The authors concluded that restrictive dermopathy is
either a primary or a secondary laminopathy, caused by dominant de novo
LMNA mutations or, more frequently, recessive null ZMPSTE24 mutations.
The accumulation of truncated or normal length prelamin A is, therefore,
a shared pathophysiologic feature in recessive and dominant restrictive
dermopathy.

- Heart-Hand Syndrome, Slovenian Type

In a Slovenian family with heart-hand syndrome (610140), originally
reported by Sinkovec et al. (2005), Renou et al. (2008) identified a
splice site mutation in the LMNA gene (150330.0045) that segregated with
disease and was not found in 100 healthy controls. Analysis of
fibroblasts from 2 affected members of the family revealed truncated
lamin A/C protein and nuclear envelope abnormalities, confirming the
pathogenicity of the mutation.

- Other Associations

Hegele et al. (2000) identified a common single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) in LMNA, 1908C/T, which was associated with obesity-related traits
in Canadian Oji-Cree. Hegele et al. (2001) reported association of this
LMNA SNP with anthropometric indices in 186 nondiabetic Canadian Inuit.
They found that physical indices of obesity, such as body mass index,
waist circumference, waist-to-hip circumference ratio, subscapular
skinfold thickness, and subscapular-to-triceps skinfold thickness ratio
were each significantly higher among Inuit subjects with the LMNA 1908T
allele than in subjects with the 1908C/1908C genotype. For each
significantly associated obesity-related trait, the LMNA 1908C/T SNP
genotype accounted for approximately 10 to 100% of the attributable
variation. The results indicated that common genetic variation in LMNA
is an important determinant of obesity-related quantitative traits.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

In 14 of 15 families with familial partial lipodystrophy, Speckman et
al. (2000) identified mutations in exon 8 of the LMNA gene: 5 families
had an R482Q mutation (150330.0010); 7 families had an R482W alteration
(150330.0011), and 1 family had a G465D alteration (150330.0015). The
R482Q and R482W mutations occurred on different haplotypes, indicating
that they probably had arisen more than once. One family with an
atypical form of familial partial lipodystrophy had an R582H mutation
(150330.0016) in exon 11 of the LMNA gene, which the authors noted can
affect the lamin A protein only. Speckman et al. (2000) noted that all
mutations in Dunnigan lipodystrophy affect the globular C-terminal
domain of the lamin A/C protein, whereas mutations responsible for
dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction-system disease are usually
clustered in the rod domain of the protein (Fatkin et al., 1999).
Speckman et al. (2000) could not detect mutations in the LMNA gene in 1
FPLD family that showed linkage to 1q21-q23.

Hegele (2005) used hierarchical cluster analysis to assemble 16
laminopathy phenotypes into 2 classes based on organ system involvement,
and then classified 91 reported causative LMNA mutations according to
their position upstream or downstream of the nuclear localization signal
(NLS) sequence. Contingency analysis revealed that laminopathy class and
LMNA mutation position were strongly correlated (p less than 0.0001),
suggesting that laminopathy phenotype and LMNA genotype are nonrandomly
associated.

Lanktree et al. (2007) analyzed the LMNA gene in 3 unrelated patients
with FPLD2 and identified heterozygosity for 3 different missense
mutations, all affecting only the lamin A isoform and each changing a
conserved residue. Two of the mutations, D230N (150330.0042) and R399C
(150330.0043), were 5-prime to the NLS, which is not typical of LMNA
mutations in FPLD2. The third mutation, S573L (150330.0041), had
previously been identified in heterozygosity in a patient with dilated
cardiomyopathy and conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200) and in
homozygosity in a patient with arthropathy, tendinous calcinosis, and
progeroid features (see 248370). None of the mutations were found in 200
controls of multiple ethnicities. Because heterozygosity for an S573L
mutation can cause cardiomyopathy without lipodystrophy or lipodystrophy
without cardiomyopathy, Lanktree et al. (2007) suggested that additional
factors, genetic or environmental, may contribute to the precise tissue
involvement.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mounkes et al. (2003) attempted to create a mouse model for autosomal
dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350) by introducing a
L530P (150330.0004) mutation in the LMNA gene. Although mice
heterozygous for L530P did not show signs of muscular dystrophy and
remained overtly normal up to 6 months of age, mice homozygous for the
mutation showed phenotypes markedly reminiscent of symptoms observed in
progeria patients. Homozygous Lmna L530P/L530P mice were
indistinguishable from their littermates at birth, but by 4 to 6 days
developed severe growth retardation, dying within 4 to 5 weeks.
Homozygous mutant mice showed a slight waddling gait, suggesting
immobility of joints. Other progeria features of these mutant mice
included micrognathia and abnormal dentition--in approximately half of
the mutants a gap was observed between the lower 2 incisors, which also
appeared yellowed. Mutant mice also had loss of subcutaneous fat,
reduced numbers of eccrine and sebaceous glands, increased collagen
deposition in skin, and decreased hair follicle density. Mounkes et al.
(2003) concluded that Lmna L530P/L530P mice have significant phenotypic
overlap with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, including nuclear
envelope abnormalities and decreased doublet capacity and life span of
fibroblasts.

Mounkes et al. (2005) generated mice expressing the human N195K
(150330.0007) mutation and observed characteristics consistent with
CMD1A. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring of cardiac activity
demonstrated that N195K-homozygous mice died at an early age due to
arrhythmia. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis showed that
Hf1b/Sp4 (600540), connexin-40 (GJA5; 121013), and connexin-43 (GJA1;
121014) were misexpressed and/or mislocalized in N195K-homozygous mouse
hearts. Desmin staining revealed a loss of organization at sarcomeres
and intercalated disks. Mounkes et al. (2005) hypothesized that
mutations within the LMNA gene may cause cardiomyopathy by disrupting
the internal organization of the cardiomyocyte and/or altering the
expression of transcription factors essential to normal cardiac
development, aging, or function.

Arimura et al. (2005) created a mouse model of autosomal dominant
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy expressing an H222P mutation in Lmna.
At adulthood, male homozygous mice displayed reduced locomotion activity
with abnormal stiff walking posture, and all died by 9 months of age.
They also developed dilated cardiomyopathy with hypokinesia and
conduction defects. These skeletal and cardiac muscle features were also
observed in the female homozygous mice, but with a later onset than in
males. Histopathologic analysis of the mice revealed muscle degeneration
with fibrosis associated with dislocation of heterochromatin and
activation of Smad signaling in heart and skeletal muscles.

Varga et al. (2006) created transgenic mice carrying the G608G
(150330.0022)-mutated human LMNA gene and observed the development of a
dramatic defect of the large arteries, consisting of progressive medial
vascular smooth muscle cell loss and replacement with proteoglycan and
collagen followed by vascular remodeling with calcification and
adventitial thickening. In vivo, these arterial abnormalities were
reflected by a blunted initial response to the vasodilator sodium
nitroprusside, consistent with impaired vascular relaxation, and
attenuated blood pressure recovery after infusion. Varga et al. (2006)
noted that although G608G transgenic mice lacked the external phenotype
seen in human progeria, they demonstrated a progressive vascular
abnormality that closely resembled the most lethal aspect of the human
phenotype.

Frock et al. (2006) found that most cultured muscle cells from Lmna
knockout mice exhibited impaired differentiation kinetics and reduced
differentiation potential. Similarly, knockdown of Lmna or emerin (EMD;
300384) expression by RNA interference in normal muscle cells impaired
differentiation potential and reduced expression of muscle-specific
genes, Myod (159970) and desmin (125660). To determine whether impaired
myogenesis was linked to reduced Myod or desmin levels, Frock et al.
(2006) individually expressed these proteins in Lmna-null myoblasts and
found that both increased the differentiation potential of mutant
myoblasts. Frock et al. (2006) concluded that LMNA and emerin are
required for myogenic differentiation, at least in part, through an
effect on expression of critical myoblast proteins.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is caused by the production
of a truncated prelamin A, called progerin, which is farnesylated at its
C terminus and accumulates at the nuclear envelope, causing misshapen
nuclei (Yang et al., 2006). Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) have
been shown to reverse this cellular abnormality (Yang et al., 2005; Toth
et al., 2005; Capell et al., 2005; Mallampalli et al., 2005). Yang et
al. (2006) generated mice with a targeted HGPS mutation (Lmna HG/+) and
observed phenotypes similar to those in human HGPS patients, including
retarded growth, reduced amounts of adipose tissue, micrognathia,
osteoporosis, and osteolytic lesions in bone, which caused spontaneous
rib fractures in the mutant mice. Treatment with an FTI increased
adipose tissue mass, improved body weight curves, reduced the number of
rib fractures, and improved bone mineralization and bone cortical
thickness.

Yang et al. (2008) created knockin mice expressing a nonfarnesylatable
form of progerin. Knockin mice developed the same disease phenotype as
mice expressing farnesylated progerin, although the phenotype was
milder, and embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice contained
fewer misshapen nuclei. The steady-state level of nonfarnesylated
progerin, but not mRNA, was lower in cultured fibroblasts and whole
tissues, suggesting that the absence of farnesylation may accelerate
progerin turnover.

In a mouse model of EDMD carrying an H222P mutation in the Lmna gene
(Arimura et al., 2005), Muchir et al. (2007) found that activation of
MAPK (see 176948) pathways preceded clinical signs or detectable
molecular markers of cardiomyopathy. Expression of H222P-mutant Lmna in
heart tissue and isolated cardiomyocytes resulted in tissue-specific
activation of MAPKs and downstream target genes. The results suggested
that activation of MAPK pathways plays a role in the pathogenesis of
cardiac disease in EDMD.

Muchir et al. (2009) demonstrated abnormal activation of the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) branch of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade in hearts of
Lmna H222P knockin mice, a model of autosomal Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy. Systemic treatment of Lmna H222P/H222P mice that developed
cardiomyopathy with PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK activation, inhibited
ERK phosphorylation and blocked the activation of downstream genes in
heart. It also blocked increased expression of RNAs encoding natriuretic
peptide precursors and proteins involved in sarcomere organization that
occurred in placebo-treated mice. Histologic analysis and
echocardiography demonstrated that treatment with PD98059 delayed the
development of left ventricular dilatation. PD98059-treated Lmna
H222P/H222P mice had normal cardiac ejection fractions assessed by
echocardiography, whereas placebo-treated mice had a 30% decrease. The
authors emphasized the role of ERK activation in the development of
cardiomyopathy caused by LMNA mutations, and provided further proof of
principle for ERK inhibition as a therapeutic option to prevent or delay
heart failure in humans with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and
related disorders caused by mutations in LMNA.

Davies et al. (2010) created knockin mice harboring a mutant Lmna allele
that yielded exclusively nonfarnesylated prelamin A. These mice had no
evidence of progeria but succumbed to cardiomyopathy. Most of the
nonfarnesylated prelamin A in the tissues of these mice was localized at
the nuclear rim, indistinguishable from the lamin A in wildtype mice.
The cardiomyopathy could not be ascribed to an absence of lamin C
because mice expressing an otherwise identical knockin allele yielding
only wildtype prelamin A appeared normal. The authors concluded that
lamin C synthesis is dispensable in mice and that failure to convert
prelamin A to mature lamin A causes cardiomyopathy in the absence of
lamin C.

Choi et al. (2012) found that ERK activation in H222P/H222P mice
specifically upregulated expression of dual-specificity phosphatase-4
(DUSP4; 602747) in cardiac muscle, with much lower Dusp4 induction in
quadriceps muscle, and no Dusp4 induction in tongue, kidney, and liver.
Dusp4 overexpression in cultured C2C12 muscle cells or targeted to mouse
heart resulted in activation of the Akt (see AKT1; 164730)-Mtor (FRAP1;
601231) metabolic signaling pathway, leading to impaired autophagy and
abnormal cardiac metabolism, similar to findings in H222P/H222P mice.

In a family with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy

In a family with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy

LMNA, ARG527PRO

In 2 families with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(181350), Bonne et al. (1999) found a G-to-C transversion in the LMNA
gene which, resulting in an arg527-to-pro (R527P) substitution. The
mutation, found in heterozygous state, was demonstrated to be de novo in
both families.

Van der Kooi et al. (2002) reported a woman with limb-girdle muscle
weakness, spinal rigidity, contractures, elevated creatine kinase,
cardiac conduction abnormalities (atrial fibrillation), partial
lipodystrophy (151660), and increased serum triglycerides who had the
R527P mutation. Van der Kooi et al. (2002) also reported a family with
the R527P mutation in which the proband, her father, and her son all
presented with varying degrees of EDMD, lipodystrophy, and cardiac
conduction abnormalities.

Makri et al. (2009) reported 2 sisters with early-onset autosomal
dominant muscular dystrophy most consistent with EDMD. Because the girls
were born of consanguineous Algerian parents, they were at first thought
to have an autosomal recessive congenital muscular dystrophy. However,
genetic analysis identified a heterozygous R527P mutation in the LMNA
gene in both patients that was not present in either unaffected parent.
The results were consistent with germline mosaicism or a recurrent de
novo event. The older sib had a difficult birth and showed congenital
hypotonia, diffuse weakness, and mild initial respiratory and feeding
difficulties. She sat unsupported at age 2 years and walked
independently from age 4 years with frequent falls and a waddling gait.
At 13 years she had a high-arched palate, moderate limb hypotonia, and
weakness of the pelvic muscles. There was proximal limb wasting,
moderate cervical, elbow, and ankle contractures, pes cavus, spinal
rigidity, and lordosis/scoliosis. Her sister had mild hypotonia in early
infancy, walked without support at 24 months, and showed proximal muscle
weakness. There were mild contractures of the elbow and ankles. At age 9
years, she showed adiposity of the neck, trunk and abdomen, consistent
with lipodystrophy. Brain MRI and cognition were normal in both sisters,
and neither had cardiac involvement. Muscle biopsies showed a dystrophic
pattern.

In a family with autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy

178C-G transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg60-to-gly
(R60G) substitution.

Van der Kooi et al. (2002) reported a woman with partial lipodystrophy
(151660), hypertriglyceridemia, and cardiomyopathy with conduction
defects who carried the R60G mutation. The patient's mother reportedly
had similar manifestations. The authors noted that lipodystrophy and
cardiac abnormalities were combined manifestations of the same mutation.

585C-G transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in an asn195-to-lys
(N195K) substitution.

Using cells from the mouse model of Mounkes et al. (2005), Ho et al.
(2013) found that Lmna N195K embryonic fibroblasts and bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells had impaired nuclear localization
of the mechanosensitive transcription factor MKL1 (606078). Cardiac
sections from Lmna(N195K/N195K) mice had significantly reduced fractions
of cardiomyocytes with nuclear Mkl1, implicating altered Mkl1 signaling
in the development of cardiomyopathy in these animals. Nuclear
accumulation of Mkl1 was substantially lower in Lmna N195K cells than in
wildtype cells. Altered nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Mkl1 was caused
by altered actin dynamics in Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells. Ectopic
expression of the nuclear envelope protein emerin (300384) restored Mkl1
nuclear translocation and rescued actin dynamics in mutant cells.

LMNA, ARG571SER

In a family with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and

1711C-A transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg571-to-ser
(R571S) substitution. In this family, the C-terminal of lamin C was
selectively affected by the mutation, and the cardiac phenotype was
relatively milder than that associated with mutations in the rod domain
of the LMNA gene. Furthermore, there was subclinical evidence of
involvement of skeletal muscle. Although affected members of this family
had no skeletal muscle symptoms, some had elevated serum creatine kinase
levels, including 1 asymptomatic family member with the genotype
associated with the disease. The arg571-to-ser mutation affected only
lamin C isoforms, whereas previously described defects causing
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350) perturbed both lamin A and
lamin C isoforms.

LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, ARG482GLN

In 5 probands from 5 Canadian kindreds with familial partial
lipodystrophy of the Dunnigan type (151660), Cao and Hegele (2000)
demonstrated heterozygosity for a G-to-A transition in exon 8 of the
LMNA gene, predicted to result in an arg484-to-gln (R482Q) substitution.
There were no differences in age, gender, or body mass index in
Q482/R482 heterozygotes compared with R482/R482 homozygotes (normals)
from these families; however, there were significantly more Q482/R482
heterozygotes who had definite partial lipodystrophy and frank diabetes.
Also compared with the normal homozygotes, heterozygotes had
significantly higher serum insulin and C-peptide (see 176730) levels.
The LMNA heterozygotes with diabetes were significantly older than
heterozygotes without diabetes.

Shackleton et al. (2000) found the R482Q mutation in a family with
familial partial lipodystrophy. Hegele et al. (2000) analyzed the
relationship between plasma leptin (164160) and the rare LMNA R482Q
mutation in 23 adult familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) subjects
compared with 25 adult family controls with normal LMNA in an extended
Canadian FPLD kindred. They found that the LMNA Q482/R482 genotype was a
significant determinant of plasma leptin, the ratio of plasma leptin to
body mass index (BMI), plasma insulin, and plasma C peptide, but not
BMI. Family members who were Q482/R482 heterozygotes had significantly
lower plasma leptin and leptin:BMI ratio than unaffected R482/R482
homozygotes. Fasting plasma concentrations of insulin and C peptide were
both significantly higher in LMNA Q482/R482 heterozygotes than in
R482/R482 homozygotes. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that
the LMNA R482Q genotype accounted for 40.9%, 48.2%, 86.9%, and 81.0%,
respectively, of the attributable variation in log leptin, leptin:BMI
ratio, log insulin, and log C peptide. The authors concluded that a rare
FPLD mutation in LMNA determines the plasma leptin concentration.

Boguslavsky et al. (2006) found that overexpression of wildtype LMNA or
mutant R482Q or R482W (150330.0011) in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes
prevented cellular lipid accumulation, inhibited triglyceride synthesis,
and prevented normal differentiation into adipocytes. In contrast,
embryonic fibroblasts from Lmna-null mice had increased levels of basal
triglyceride synthesis and differentiated into fat-containing cells more
readily that wildtype mouse cells. Mutations at residue 482 are not
predicted to affect the structure of the nuclear lamina, but may change
interactions with other proteins. The findings of this study suggested
that mutations responsible for FPLD are gain-of-function mutations.
Boguslavsky et al. (2006) postulated that mutations that result in gain
of function may cause higher binding affinity to a proadipogenic
transcription factor, thus preventing it from activating target genes;
overexpression of the wildtype protein may result in increased numbers
of molecules with a normal binding affinity. Overexpression of Lmna was
associated with decreased levels of PPARG2 (601487), a nuclear hormone
receptor transcription factor putatively involved in adipogenic
conversion. Lmna-null cells had increased basal phosphorylation of AKT1
(164730), a mediator of insulin signaling.

LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, ARG482TRP

In 6 families and 3 isolated cases of partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Shackleton et al. (2000) found heterozygosity for C-to-T transition in
the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg482-to-trp (R482W) substitution. This
is the same codon as that affected in the R482Q mutation (150330.0010).
R482L (150330.0012) is a third mutation in the same codon causing
partial lipodystrophy.

Schmidt et al. (2001) identified a family with partial lipodystrophy
carrying the R482W mutation in the LMNA gene. Clinically, the loss of
subcutaneous fat and muscular hypertrophy, especially of the lower
extremities, started as early as in childhood. Acanthosis and severe
hypertriglyceridemia developed later in life, followed by diabetes.
Characterization of the lipoprotein subfractions revealed that affected
children present with hyperlipidemia. The presence and severity of
hyperlipidemia seem to be influenced by age, apolipoprotein E genotype,
and the coexistence of diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, dyslipidemia is
an early and prominent feature in the presented lipodystrophic family
carrying the R482W mutation.

In a large family with a severe autosomal dominant dilated
cardiomyopathy with conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200) in which the
majority of affected family members showed signs of mild skeletal muscle
involvement, Brodsky et al. (2000) demonstrated heterozygosity in
affected members for a 1-bp deletion (del959T) deletion in exon 6 of the
LMNA gene. One individual had a pattern of skeletal muscle involvement
that the authors considered consistent with mild Emery-Dreifuss muscular

In a 40-year-old man with a severe, atypical form of EDMD (see 181350),
Raffaele di Barletta et al. (2000) found a homozygous 664C-T transition
in the LMNA gene, resulting in a his222-to-tyr (H222Y) amino acid
substitution. Both parents, who were first cousins, were heterozygous
for the mutation and were unaffected. The mutation was not found among
200 control chromosomes. The patient was the only one with a homozygous

Speckman et al. (2000) found that 1 of 15 families with familial partial

In a family with an atypical form of familial partial lipodystrophy
(151660), Speckman et al. (2000) identified an arg582-to-his (R582H)
mutation in exon 11 of the LMNA gene. In a follow-up of this same
family, Garg et al. (2001) reported that 2 affected sisters showed less
severe loss of subcutaneous fat from the trunk and extremities with some
retention of fat in the gluteal region and medial parts of the proximal
thighs compared to women with typical FPLD2. Noting that the R582H
mutation interrupts only the lamin A protein, Garg et al. (2001)
suggested that in typical FPLD2, interruption of both lamins A and C
causes a more severe phenotype than that seen in atypical FPLD2, in
which only lamin A is altered.

In a family with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (159001), Muchir
et al. (2000) found a G-to-A transition in exon 6 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in a substitution of histidine for arginine-377 (R377H).

Taylor et al. (2003) identified heterozygosity for the R377H mutation in
an American family of British descent with autosomal dominant dilated
cardiomyopathy and mild limb-girdle muscular disease.

Charniot et al. (2003) described a French family with autosomal dominant
severe dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects or
atrial/ventricular arrhythmias and a skeletal muscular dystrophy of the
quadriceps muscles. Affected members were found to carry the R377H
mutation, which was shown by transfection experiments in both muscular
and nonmuscular cells to lead to mislocalization of both lamin and
emerin (300384). Unlike previously reported cases of LMNA mutations
causing dilated cardiomyopathy with neuromuscular involvement, cardiac
involvement preceded neuromuscular disease in all affected members.
Charniot et al. (2003) suggested that factors other than the R377H
mutation influenced phenotypic expression in this family. Sebillon et
al. (2003) also reported on this family.

In a German woman with LGMD1B, Rudnik-Schoneborn et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous R377H mutation in the LMNA gene. Family
history revealed that the patient's paternal grandmother had proximal
muscle weakness and died from heart disease at age 52, and a paternal
aunt had 'walking difficulties' since youth. The patient's father and 4
cousins all had cardiac disease without muscle weakness ranging from
nonspecific 'heart attacks' to dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia.
The only living affected cousin also carried the mutation.

In a family with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (159001), Muchir
et al. (2000) found a G-to-C transversion in the splice donor site of
intron 9, leading to retention of intron 9 and a frameshift at position
536. This potentially results in a truncated protein lacking half of the
globular tail domain of lamins A/C.

Ben Yaou et al. (2007) identified a homozygous R298C mutation in a
female and 2 male affected members of an Algerian family with CMT2B1.
The 2 males also had X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (310300)

In 5 consanguineous Italian families, Novelli et al. (2002) demonstrated
that individuals with mandibuloacral dysplasia (248370) were homozygous
for an arg527-to-his (R527H) mutation.

In affected members from 2 pedigrees with MADA, Simha et al. (2003)
identified the homozygous R527H mutation.

In a Mexican American boy with MADA born of related parents, Shen et al.
(2003) identified homozygosity for the R527H mutation. The authors noted
that all the patients reported by Novelli et al. (2002) shared a common
disease haplotype, but that the patients reported by Simha et al. (2003)
and their Mexican American patient had different haplotypes, indicating
independent origins of the mutation. The mutation is located within the
C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain in the center of a beta sheet on
the domain surface of the protein.

Lombardi et al. (2007) identified this mutation in compound
heterozygosity with another missense mutation (150330.0044) in a patient
with an apparent MADA phenotype associated with muscular hyposthenia and
generalized hypotonia.

Garavelli et al. (2009) reported 2 unrelated patients with early
childhood onset of MADA features associated with a homozygous R527H
mutation. One presented at age 5 years, 3 months with bulbous distal
phalanges of fingers and was observed to have dysmorphic craniofacial
features, lipodystrophy type A, and acroosteolysis. The second child,
born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, presented at age 4 years, 2
months with a round face, chubby cheeks, thin nose, lipodystrophy type
A, and short, broad distal phalanges. Garavelli et al. (2009) emphasized
that features of this disorder may become apparent as early as preschool
age and that bulbous fingertips may be a clue to the diagnosis.

LMNA, GLY608GLY

In 18 of 20 patients with classic Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome
(176670), Eriksson et al. (2003) found an identical de novo 1824C-T
transition, resulting in a silent gly-to-gly mutation at codon 608
(G608G) within exon 11 of the LMNA gene. This substitution created an
exonic consensus splice donor sequence and results in activation of a
cryptic splice site and deletion of 50 codons of prelamin A. This
mutation was not identified in any of the 16 parents available for
testing.

De Sandre-Giovannoli et al. (2003) identified the exon 11 cryptic splice
site activation mutation (1824C-T+1819-1968del) in 2 HGPS patients.
Immunocytochemical analyses of lymphocytes from 1 patient using specific
antibodies directed against lamin A/C, lamin A, and lamin B1 showed that
most cells had strikingly altered nuclear sizes and shapes, with
envelope interruptions accompanied by chromatin extrusion. Lamin A was
detected in 10 to 20% of HGPS lymphocytes. Only lamin C was present in
most cells, and lamin B1 was found in the nucleoplasm, suggesting that
it had dissociated from the nuclear envelope due to the loss of lamin A.
Western blot analysis showed 25% of normal lamin A levels, and no
truncated form was detected.

Cao and Hegele (2003) confirmed the observations of Eriksson et al.
(2003) using the same cell lines. They referred to this mutation as
2036C-T.

D'Apice et al. (2004) confirmed paternal age effect and demonstrated a
paternal origin of the 2036C-T mutation in 3 families with isolated
cases of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria.

By light and electron microscopy of fibroblasts from HGPS patients
carrying the 1824C-T mutation, Goldman et al. (2004) found significant
changes in nuclear shape, including lobulation of the nuclear envelope,
thickening of the nuclear lamina, loss of peripheral heterochromatin,
and clustering of nuclear pores. These structural defects worsened as
the HGPS cells aged in culture, and their severity correlated with an
apparent accumulation of mutant protein, which Goldman et al. (2004)
designated LA delta-50. Introduction of LA delta-50 into normal cells by
transfection or protein injection induced the same changes. Goldman et
al. (2004) hypothesized that the alterations in nuclear structure are
due to a concentration-dependent dominant-negative effect of LA
delta-50, leading to the disruption of lamin-related functions ranging
from the maintenance of nuclear shape to regulation of gene expression
and DNA replication.

In an infant with restrictive dermopathy (275210), Navarro et al. (2004)
identified the 1824C-T transition in heterozygous state.

In a patient with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, Wuyts et al. (2005)
identified the G608G mutation. In lymphocyte DNA from the parents,
normal wildtype alleles were observed in the father, but a low signal
corresponding to the mutant allele was detected in the mother's DNA. A
segregation study confirmed that the patient's mutation was transmitted
from the mother, who showed germline and somatic mosaicism without
manifestations of HGPS.

Glynn and Glover (2005) studied the effects of farnesylation inhibition
on nuclear phenotypes in cells expressing normal and G608G-mutant lamin
A. Expression of a GFP-progerin fusion protein in normal fibroblasts
caused a high incidence of nuclear abnormalities (as seen in HGPS
fibroblasts), and resulted in abnormal nuclear localization of
GFP-progerin in comparison with the localization pattern of GFP-lamin A.
Expression of a GFP-lamin A fusion containing a mutation preventing the
final cleavage step, which caused the protein to remain farnesylated,
displayed identical localization patterns and nuclear abnormalities as
in HGPS cells and in cells expressing GFP-progerin. Exposure to a
farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), PD169541, caused a significant
improvement in the nuclear morphology of cells expressing GFP-progerin
and in HGPS cells. Glynn and Glover (2005) proposed that abnormal
farnesylation of progerin may play a role in the cellular phenotype in
HGPS cells, and suggested that FTIs may represent a therapeutic option
for patients with HGPS.

In cells from a female patient with HGPS due to the 1824C-T mutation,
Shumaker et al. (2006) found that the inactive X chromosome showed loss
of histone H3 trimethylation of lys27 (H3K27me3), a marker for
facultative heterochromatin, as well as loss of histone H3
trimethylation of lys9 (H3K9me3), a marker of pericentric constitutive
heterochromatin. Other alterations in epigenetic control included
downregulation of the EZH2 methyltransferase (601573), upregulation of
pericentric satellite III repeat transcripts, and increase in the
trimethylation of H4K20. The epigenetic alterations were observed before
the pathogenic changes in nuclear shape. The findings indicated that the
mutant LMNA protein alters sites of histone methylation known to
regulate heterochromatin and provided evidence that the rapid aging
phenotype of HGPS reflects aspects of normal aging at the molecular
level.

Moulson et al. (2007) demonstrated that HGPS cells with the common
1824C-T LMNA mutation produced about 37.5% of wildtype full-length
transcript, which was higher than previous estimates (Reddel and Weiss,
2004).

Using real-time RT-PCR, Rodriguez et al. (2009) found that progerin
transcripts were expressed in dermal fibroblasts cultured from normal
controls, but at a level more than 160-fold lower than that detected in
dermal fibroblasts cultured from HGPS patients. The level of progerin
transcripts, but not of lamin A or lamin C transcripts, increased in
late-passage cells from both normal controls and HGPS patients.

HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, ATYPICAL
LMNA, GLU145LYS

In a patient with somewhat atypical features of progeria (176670),
Eriksson et al. (2003) identified a glu-to-lys substitution at codon 145
(E145K) in exon 2 of the LMNA gene. This mutation was not identified in
either parent. Atypical clinical features, including persistence of
coarse hair over the head, ample subcutaneous tissue over the arms and
legs, and severe strokes beginning at age 4, may subtly distinguish this
phenotype from classic HGPS.

.0025
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY, ATYPICAL
LMNA, ARG471CYS

In a patient with an apparently typical progeria phenotype (176670) who
was 28 years old at the time that DNA was obtained, Cao and Hegele
(2003) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in
the LMNA gene. One mutation, arg471 to cys (R471C), resulted from a
1623C-T transition. An arg527-to-cys (R527C) substitution (150330.0026),
resulting from a 1791C-T transition, was found on the other allele.
These mutations were not identified in any of 100 control chromosomes.
Parental DNA for this patient and a clinical description of the parents
were not available. Brown (2004) reported that both he and the patient's
physician, Francis Collins, concluded that the patient had
mandibuloacral dysplasia (248370).

Zirn et al. (2008) reported a 7-year-old Turkish girl, born of
consanguineous parents, who was homozygous for the R471C mutation. She
had a phenotype most consistent with an atypical form of MADA, including
lipodystrophy, a progeroid appearance, and congenital muscular dystrophy
with rigid spine syndrome. These latter features were reminiscent of
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350), although there was no
cardiac involvement. She presented at age 10 months with proximal muscle
weakness, contractures, spinal rigidity, and a dystrophic skeletal
muscle biopsy. Characteristic progeroid features and features of
lipodystrophy and mandibuloacral dysplasia were noted at age 3 years and
became more apparent with age. Zirn et al. (2008) commented on the
severity of the phenotype and emphasized the phenotypic variability in
patients with LMNA mutations.

LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, CHILDHOOD-ONSET, INCLUDED
LMNA, ARG133LEU

In a male patient whose phenotype associated generalized acquired
lipoatrophy with insulin-resistant diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and
hepatic steatosis (151660), Caux et al. (2003) found a heterozygous
398G-T transversion in exon 2 of the LMNA gene that resulted in an
arg-to-leu change at codon 133 (R133L) in the dimerization rod domain of
lamins A and C. The patient also had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with
valvular involvement and disseminated whitish papules.
Immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of the patient's cultured skin
fibroblasts revealed nuclear disorganization and abnormal distribution
of A-type lamins, similar to that observed in patients harboring other
LMNA mutations. This observation broadened the clinical spectrum of
laminopathies, pointing out the clinical variability of lipodystrophy
and the possibility of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and skin involvement.

In 2 unrelated persons with a progeroid syndrome (see 176670), Chen et
al. (2003) found heterozygosity for the R1333L mutation in the LMNA
gene. One was a white Portuguese female who presented at the age of 9
years with short stature. She showed scleroderma-like skin changes and
graying/thinning of hair. Type 2 diabetes developed at the age of 23
years. Hypogonadism, osteoporosis, and voice changes were also present.
The other patient was an African American female in whom the diagnosis
of a progeroid syndrome was made at the age of 18 years.
Scleroderma-like skin, short stature, graying/thinning of hair, and type
2 diabetes at the age of 18 years were features. The deceased father,
paternal aunt, and paternal grandmother of this patient were also
diagnosed with severe insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus, suggesting
that the R133L mutation might have been paternally inherited. It is
noteworthy that a substitution in the same codon, R133P (150330.0032),
was reported in a 40-year-old patient with Emery-Dreifuss muscular
dystrophy who had disease onset at age 7 years and atrial fibrillation
at age 32 years (Brown et al., 2001). Although Chen et al. (2003)
designated these patients as having 'atypical Werner syndrome' (277700),
Hegele (2003) suggested that the patients more likely had late-onset
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

Vigouroux et al. (2003) emphasized that a striking feature in the
patient reported by Caux et al. (2003) was muscular hypertrophy of the
limbs, which contrasts with the muscular atrophy usually present in
Werner syndrome. Muscular hypertrophy, along with insulin-resistant
diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, is more often associated with
LMNA-linked Dunnigan lipodystrophy. Fibroblasts from their patient
showed nuclear abnormalities identical to those described in Dunnigan
lipodystrophy (Vigouroux et al., 2001).

Jacob et al. (2005) studied the pattern of body fat distribution and
metabolic abnormalities in the 2 patients with atypical Werner syndrome
described by Chen et al. (2003). Patient 1, an African American female,
had normal body fat (27%) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).
However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed relative paucity of
subcutaneous fat in the distal extremities, with preservation of
subcutaneous truncal fat. She had impaired glucose tolerance and
elevated postprandial serum insulin levels. In contrast, patient 2, a
Caucasian female, had only 11.6% body fat as determined by DEXA and had
generalized loss of subcutaneous and intraabdominal fat on MRI. She had
hypertriglyceridemia and severe insulin-resistant diabetes requiring
more than 200 U of insulin daily. Skin fibroblasts showed markedly
abnormal nuclear morphology compared with those from patient 1. Despite
the deranged nuclear morphology, the lamin A/C remained localized to the
nuclear envelope, and the nuclear DNA remained within the nucleus. Jacob
et al. (2005) concluded that atypical Werner syndrome associated with an
R133L mutation in the LMNA gene is phenotypically heterogeneous.
Furthermore, the severity of metabolic complications seemed to correlate
with the extent of lipodystrophy.

CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, GLU161LYS

Sebillon et al. (2003) described a family with a history of sudden
cardiac death, congestive heart failure, and dilated cardiomyopathy
(CMD1A; 115200). Five affected members had a heterozygous 481G-A
transition in exon 2 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a glu161-to-lys
(E161K) mutation. Dilated cardiomyopathy was present in only 2 patients,
in whom onset of the disease was characterized by congestive heart
failure and atrial fibrillation (at 29 and 44 years, respectively);
heart transplantation was performed in both patients (at 34 and 51 years
of age). In the 3 other affected members, the onset of disease was also
characterized by atrial fibrillation at 22, 49, and 63 years, but
without dilated cardiomyopathy. A 16-year-old male and 12-year-old
female were also heterozygous for the mutation, but had no signs or
symptoms of heart disease. The 5 affected members were a mother and 2
daughters in 1 branch of the family and 2 brothers in another branch.
Two cardiac deaths were reported in the family history: sudden death at
38 years and congestive heart failure at 68 years. No significant
atrioventricular block was observed in the family, except in 1 patient
for whom cardiac pacing was necessary at 67 years of age because of
sinoatrial block coexisting with atrial fibrillation. Sebillon et al.
(2003) concluded that the phenotype in this family was characterized by
early atrial fibrillation preceding or coexisting with dilated
cardiomyopathy, without significant atrioventricular block, and without
neuromuscular abnormalities.

.0029
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, 1-BP INS, 28A

Sebillon et al. (2003) described a family in which 5 patients with
dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200) were
heterozygous for a 1-bp insertion, 28insA, in exon 1 of the LMNA gene.
Three additional patients were considered as phenotypically affected
with documented dilated cardiomyopathy but were not available for DNA
analysis. In the family history, there were 3 cardiac sudden deaths
before 55 years of age. In the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, 3
had associated atrioventricular block requiring pacemaker implantation,
1 had premature ventricular beats leading to a cardioverter
defibrillator implantation, and 1 had a mild form of skeletal muscular
dystrophy (mild weakness and wasting of quadriceps muscles, as well as
myogenic abnormalities on electromyogram).

.0030
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, WITH HYPERGONADOTRIPIC HYPOGONADISM
LMNA, ALA57PRO

In an Iranian female with short stature and a progeroid syndrome (see
176670), Chen et al. (2003) found a heterozygous de novo ala57-to-pro
substitution (A57P) resulting from a 584G-C transversion in the LMNA
gene. Onset occurred in her early teens, and she was 23 years old at
diagnosis. Hypogonadism, osteoporosis, osteosclerosis of digits, and
dilated cardiomyopathy were described. Although Chen et al. (2003)
designated this patient as having 'atypical Werner syndrome' (277700),
Hegele (2003) suggested that the patient more likely had late-onset
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

McPherson et al. (2009) suggested that the patient in whom Chen et al.
(2003) identified an A57P LMNA mutation had a distinct phenotype
involving dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism
(212112).

.0031
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, CHILDHOOD-ONSET
LMNA, LEU140ARG

In a white Norwegian male with a progeroid syndrome (see 176670), Chen
et al. (2003) found a leu140-to-arg (L140R) substitution resulting from
an 834T-G transversion in the LMNA gene. The patient had onset at age 14
of cataracts, scleroderma-like skin, and graying/thinning of hair, as
well as hypogonadism, osteoporosis, soft tissue calcification, and
premature atherosclerosis. Aortic stenosis and insufficiency were also
present. The patient died at the age of 36 years. Although Chen et al.
(2003) designated this patient as having 'atypical Werner syndrome'
(277700), Hegele (2003) suggested that the patient more likely had
late-onset Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

.0032
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
LMNA, ARG133PRO

In a 40-year-old patient with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350)
who had disease onset at age 7 years and atrial fibrillation at age 32
years, Brown et al. (2001) found an arg133-to-pro (R133P) mutation in
the LMNA gene. Chen et al. (2003) noted that the same codon is involved
in the arg133-to-leu (150330.0027) mutation in atypical Werner syndrome.

.0033
MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
LMNA, LYS542ASN

In 4 affected members of a consanguineous family from north India with
features of MADA (248370). Plasilova et al. (2004) identified a
homozygous 1626G-C transversion in exon 10 of the LMNA gene, resulting
in a lys542-to-asn (K542N) substitution. The parents and 1 unaffected
daughter were heterozygous for the mutation. Patients in this family
showed uniform skeletal malformations such as acroosteolysis of the
digits, micrognathia, and clavicular aplasia/hypoplasia, characteristic
of mandibuloacral dysplasia. However, the patients also had classic
features of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (176670). Plasilova et
al. (2004) suggested that autosomal recessive HGPS and MADA may
represent a single disorder with varying degrees of severity.

.0034
MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL, LMNA-RELATED
LMNA, SER143PHE

In a young girl with congenital muscular dystrophy and progeroid
features (see 613205), Kirschner et al. (2005) identified a 1824C-T
transition in the LMNA gene, resulting in a de novo heterozygous
missense mutation, ser143 to phe (S143F). The child presented during the
first year of life with myopathy with marked axial weakness, feeding
difficulties, poor head control and axial weakness. Progeroid features,
including growth failure, sclerodermatous skin changes, and osteolytic
lesions, developed later. At routine examination at age 8 years, she was
found to have a mediolateral myocardial infarction.

In cultured skin fibroblasts derived from the patient reported by
Kirschner et al. (2005), Kandert et al. (2007) found dysmorphic nuclei
with blebs and lobulations that accumulated progressively with cell
passage. Immunofluorescent staining showed altered lamin A/C
organization and aggregate formation. There was aberrant localization of
lamin-associated proteins, particularly emerin (EMD; 300384) and
nesprin-2 (SYNE2; 608442), which was reduced or absent from the nuclear
envelope. However, a subset of mutant cells expressing the giant 800-kD
isoform of SYNE2 showed a milder phenotype, suggesting that this isoform
exerts a protective effect. Proliferating cells were observed to express
the 800-kD SYNE2 isoform, whereas nonproliferating cells did not. In
addition, mutant cells showed defects in the intranuclear organization
of acetylated histones and RNA polymerase II compared to control cells.
The findings indicated that the S143F mutant protein affects nuclear
envelope architecture and composition, chromatin organization, gene
expression, and transcription. The findings also implicated nesprin-2 as
a structural reinforcer at the nuclear envelope.

MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
LMNA, TYR259TER

In 9 affected members of Dutch family with limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy type 1B (159001), van Engelen et al. (2005) identified a
777T-A transversion in the LMNA gene, resulting in a tyr259-to-ter
substitution (Y259X). The heterozygous Y259X mutation led to a classic
LGMD1B phenotype. One infant homozygous for the mutation was born of
consanguineous parents who were both affected, and delivered at 30
weeks' gestational age by cesarean section because of decreasing cardiac
rhythm. The infant died at birth from very severe generalized muscular
dystrophy. Cultured skin fibroblasts from the infant showed complete
absence of A-type lamins leading to disorganization of the lamina,
alterations in the protein composition of the inner nuclear membrane,
and decreased life span. Van Engelen et al. (2005) noted that the
fibroblasts from this child showed remarkable similarity, in nuclear
architectural defects and in decreased life span, to the fibroblasts of
homozygous LMNA (L530P/L530P) mice (Mounkes et al., 2003).

.0036
RESTRICTIVE DERMOPATHY, LETHAL
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME, INCLUDED
LMNA, IVS11, G-A, +1

In a premature infant who died at 6 months of age due to restrictive
dermopathy (275210), Navarro et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous
G-to-A transition at position 1 in the intron 11 donor site of the LMNA
gene (IVS11+1G-A), resulting in loss of exon 11 from the transcript. The
patient expressed lamins A and C and a truncated prelamin A.

In a patient with an extremely severe form of HGPS (176670), Moulson et
al. (2007) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition at the +1
position of the donor splice site of intron 11 in the LMNA gene
(1968+1G-A). RT-PCR studies showed a truncated protein product identical
to that observed in HGPS cell lines with the common 1824C-T mutation
(150330.0022), indicating that the new mutation resulted in the abnormal
use of the same cryptic exon 11 splice site. The findings were in
contrast to those reported by Navarro et al. (2004), who observed
skipping of exon 11 with 1968+1G-A. Further quantitative studies of the
patient's cells by Moulson et al. (2007) found a 4.5-fold increase in
the relative ratio of mutant mRNA and protein to wildtype prelamin A
compared to typical HGPS cells. The findings were confirmed by Western
blot analysis and provided an explanation for the severe phenotype
observed in this patient. He had had abnormally thick and tight skin
observed at 11 weeks of age, and developed more typical but severe
progeroid features over time. He died of infection at age 3.5 years.

MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
LMNA, ALA529VAL

In 2 unrelated Turkish patients with mandibuloacral dysplasia with type
A lipodystrophy (248370), a 21-year-old woman previously described by
Cogulu et al. (2003) and an 18-year-old man, Garg et al. (2005)
identified homozygosity for a 1586C-T transition in the LMNA gene,
resulting in an ala529-to-val (A529V) substitution. Intragenic SNPs
revealed a common haplotype spanning 2.5 kb around the mutated
nucleotide in the parents of both patients, suggesting ancestral origin
of the mutation. The female patient had no breast development despite
normal menstruation, a phenotype different from that seen in women with
the R527H mutation (150330.0021).

MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, LIMB-GIRDLE, TYPE 1B
LMNA, GLN493TER

In a German woman with LGMD1B (159001), Rudnik-Schoneborn et al. (2007)
identified a heterozygous 1477C-T transition in exon 8 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in a gln493-to-ter (Q493X) substitution. She presented with
slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness beginning in the lower
extremities and later involving the upper extremities. EMG showed both
neurogenic and myopathic defects in the quadriceps muscle. At age 53
years, she was diagnosed with atrioventricular conduction block and
arrhythmia requiring pacemaker implantation. Family history showed that
her mother had walking difficulties from age 40 years and died of a
heart attack at age 54. Six other deceased family members had suspected
cardiomyopathy without muscle involvement.

.0039
LIPODYSTROPHY, FAMILIAL PARTIAL, TYPE 2
LMNA, IVS8, G-C, +5

Morel et al. (2006) reported 2 sisters, the children of
nonconsanguineous Punjabi parents, with familial partial lipodystrophy
type 2 (FPLD2; 151660). The first presented with acanthosis nigricans at
age 5 years, diabetes with insulin resistance, hypertension, and
hypertriglyceridemia at age 13 years, and partial lipodystrophy starting
at puberty. Her sister and their mother had a similar metabolic profile
and physical features, and their mother died of vascular disease at age
32 years. LMNA sequencing showed that the sisters were each heterozygous
for a novel G-to-C mutation at the intron 8 consensus splice donor site,
which was absent from the genomes of 300 healthy individuals. The
retention of intron 8 in mRNA predicted a prematurely truncated lamin A
isoform (516 instead of 664 amino acids) with 20 nonsense 3-prime
terminal residues. The authors concluded that this was the first LMNA
splicing mutation to be associated with FPLD2, and that it causes a
severe clinical and metabolic phenotype.

.0040
HUTCHINSON-GILFORD PROGERIA SYNDROME
LMNA, VAL607VAL

In a patient with a severe form of HGPS (176670), Moulson et al. (2007)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1821G-A transition in exon 11 of the
LMNA gene, resulting in a val607-to-val (V607V) substitution. The
1821G-A mutation favored the use of the same cryptic splice site as the
common 1824C-T mutation (150330.0022) and produced the same resultant
progerin product. However, the ratio of mutant to wildtype mRNA and
protein was increased in the patient compared to typical HGPS cells. The
patient had flexion contractures, thick and tight skin, and other severe
progeroid features. He died of infection at 26 days of age.

LMNA, SER573LEU

In a 50-year-old Italian woman with sporadic dilated cardiomyopathy with
conduction defects (CMD1A; 115200), Taylor et al. (2003) identified
heterozygosity for a 1718C-T transition in exon 11 of the LMNA gene,
resulting in a ser573-to-leu substitution at a highly conserved residue,
predicted to affect the carboxyl tail of the lamin A isoform. The
mutation was not found in the proband's 2 unaffected offspring or in 300
control chromosomes, but her unaffected 60-year-old sister also carried
the mutation.

Van Esch et al. (2006) analyzed the LMNA gene in a 44-year-old male of
European descent with arthropathy, tendinous calcifications, and a
progeroid appearance (see 248370) and identified homozygosity for the
S573L mutation. Progeroid features included a small pinched nose, small
lips, micrognathia with crowded teeth, cataract, and alopecia. He also
had generalized lipodystrophy, and sclerodermatous skin. The arthropathy
affected predominantly the distal femora and proximal tibia in the knee
with tendinous calcifications. However, he had normal clavicles and no
evidence of acroosteolysis. The authors concluded that he had a novel
phenotype. The patient's unaffected 15-year-old son was heterozygous for
the mutation, which was not found in 450 control chromosomes. The
authors noted that the patient had no evidence of cardiomyopathy and his
70-year-old mother, an obligate heterozygote, had no known cardiac
problems.

In a 75-year-old European male with partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Lanktree et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for the S573L mutation
in the LMNA gene.

In a 46-year-old South Asian female with partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Lanktree et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 688G-A transition
in exon 4 of the LMNA gene, resulting in an asp230-to-asn (D230N)
substitution at a conserved residue located 5-prime to the nuclear
localization signal. The mutation, predicted to affect only the lamin A
isoform, was not found in 200 controls of multiple ethnic backgrounds.

LMNA, ARG399CYS

In a 50-year-old European female with partial lipodystrophy (151660),
Lanktree et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity for a 1195C-T
transition in exon 7 of the LMNA gene, resulting in an arg399-to-cys
(R399C) substitution at a conserved residue located 5-prime to the
nuclear localization signal. The mutation, predicted to affect only the
lamin A isoform, was not found in 200 controls of multiple ethnic
backgrounds.

Decaudain et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous R399 mutation in a
woman with severe metabolic syndrome. She was diagnosed with
insulin-resistant diabetes at age 32. Chronic hyperglycemia led to
retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and renal failure. She had severe
hypertriglyceridemia and diffuse atherosclerosis, requiring coronary
artery bypass at age 49. Physical examination revealed android fat
distribution with lipoatrophy of lower limbs and calves hypertrophy
without any muscle weakness. Her mother and a brother had diabetes and
died several years earlier.

MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY, ATYPICAL
LMNA, VAL440MET

In a 27-year-old Italian woman with a mandibuloacral dysplasia type A
(MADA; 248370)-like phenotype, Lombardi et al. (2007) found compound
heterozygosity for missense mutations in the LMNA cDNA: a G-to-A
transition at position 1318 in exon 7 that gave rise to a val-to-met
substitution at codon 440 (V440M), and an R527H substitution
(150330.0021). Each healthy parent was a simple heterozygote for one or
the other mutation. The apparent MADA phenotype was associated with
muscular hyposthenia and generalized hypotonia. Clavicular hypoplasia
and metabolic imbalances were absent. Lombardi et al. (2007)
hypothesized that lack of homozygosity for the R527H mutation attenuated
the MADA phenotype, while the V440M mutation may have contributed to
both the muscle phenotype and the pathogenic effect of the single R527H
mutation.

In affected members of a Slovenian family with heart-hand syndrome
(610140), originally reported by Sinkovec et al. (2005), Renou et al.
(2008) identified heterozygosity for a T-G transversion in intron 9 of
the LMNA gene (IVS9-12T-G), predicted to cause a frameshift and
premature termination in exon 10, with the addition of 14 new amino
acids at the C terminus. The mutation was not found in unaffected family
members or in 100 healthy controls. Analysis of fibroblasts from 2
affected individuals confirmed the presence of truncated protein and
revealed aberrant localization of lamin A/C accumulated in intranuclear
foci as well as dysmorphic nuclei with nuclear envelope herniations.

MANDIBULOACRAL DYSPLASIA WITH TYPE A LIPODYSTROPHY
LMNA, ALA529THR

In a 56-year-old Japanese woman, born of consanguineous parents, with
mandibuloacral dysplasia and type A lipodystrophy (248370), Kosho et al.
(2007) identified a homozygous 1585G-A transition in exon 9 of the LMNA
gene, resulting in an ala529-to-thr (A529T) substitution. The authors
stated that she was the oldest reported patient with the disorder. In
addition to classic MAD with lipodystrophy type A phenotype, including
progeroid appearance, acroosteolysis of the distal phalanges, and loss
of subcutaneous fat in the limbs, she had severe progressive destructive
skeletal and osteoporotic changes. Vertebral collapse led to paralysis.
However, Kosho et al. (2007) also noted that other factors may have
contributed to the severe osteoporosis observed in this patient. Another
mutation in this codon, A529V (150330.0037), results in a similar
phenotype.

talipes foot deformities. She lost head support at 9 months, had
respiratory insufficiency, joint contractures, and axial and limb muscle
weakness. A de novo heterozygous R249W mutation was also identified in
an unrelated 3-year-old boy with congenital LGMD1B who showed decreased
movements in utero, hypotonia, distal contractures, no head or trunk

transition in exon 5 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a glu358-to-lys
(E358K) substitution in 5 unrelated patients with muscular dystrophy.
Three patients had the common phenotype of autosomal dominant
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (181350), 1 had early-onset LGMD1B
(159001), and the last had had a more severe disorder consistent with
congenital muscular dystrophy (613205). The mutation was not identified
in 150 controls. The patient with LGMD1B also had cardiac conduction
abnormalities, respiratory failure, and features of lipodystrophy
(151660). Mercuri et al. (2004) commented on the extreme phenotypic
variability associated with this mutation.

In 4 unrelated patients with LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy,
Quijano-Roy et al. (2008) identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in
exon 6 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a glu358-to-lys (E358K)
substitution. Three patients presented before 1 year of age with
hypotonia and later developed head drop with neck muscle weakness. There
was delayed motor development with early loss of ambulation, distal limb
contractures, axial and limb muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency
requiring mechanical ventilation, increased serum creatine kinase, and
dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy. One patient developed ventricular
tachycardia at age 20 years. The fourth patient with congenital LGMD1B
had decreased fetal movements and presented at age 3 to 6 months with
hypotonia, loss of head control, and delayed motor development.

MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, CONGENITAL, LMNA-RELATED
LMNA, 3-BP DEL, 94AAG

In an 18-month-old boy with LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy
(613205), D'Amico et al. (2005) identified a de novo heterozygous 3-bp
deletion (94delAAG) in exon 1 of the LMNA gene, resulting in the
deletion of lys32. Although he had normal early motor development, he
showed prominent neck extensor weakness resulting in a 'dropped head'
phenotype at age 1 year. He was able to stand independently but had some
difficulty walking.

.0051
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
LMNA, ARG644CYS

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to various phenotypes has not been confirmed.

An arg644-to-cys (R644C) mutation in the LMNA gene has been found in
several different phenotypic presentations (Genschel et al., 2001;
Mercuri et al., 2005; Rankin et al., 2008); however, the pathogenicity
of the mutation has not been confirmed (Moller et al., 2009).

In a German patient with dilated cardiomyopathy with no history history
of conduction system disease (see 152000), Genschel et al. (2001)
identified heterozygosity for a 1930C-T transition in exon 11 of the
LMNA gene resulting in an R644C substitution in the C-terminal domain of
lamin A. The authors noted that the mutation is solely within lamin A,
but not lamin C, whereas previously reported mutations causing dilated
cardiomyopathy are located more in the rod domain of the protein.

Mercuri et al. (2005) identified heterozygosity for the R644C mutation
in 4 patients with skeletal and cardiac muscle involvement of varying
severity. In 1 patient, the mutation was found in the affected brother
and the unaffected father, and was not found in the affected mother. The
mutation was not found in 100 unrelated control subjects.

Rankin et al. (2008) described 9 patients in 8 families with the same
mutation. Patients 1 and 2 presented with lipodystrophy and insulin
resistance; patient 1 also had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
Patient 3 presented with motor neuropathy, patient 4 with arthrogryposis
and dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular noncompaction, patient
5 with severe scoliosis and contractures, patient 6 with limb-girdle
weakness, and patient 7 with hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance.
Patients 8 and 9 were brothers who had proximal weakness and
contractures. The same LMNA was identified in 9 unaffected individuals
in these 9 families, but was not detected in 200 German and 300 British
controls. Rankin et al. (2008) suggested that extreme phenotypic
diversity and low penetrance are associated with the R644C mutation.

.0052
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, WITH HYPERGONADOTRIPIC HYPOGONADISM
LMNA, LEU59ARG

In a 17-year-old Caucasian female with dilated cardiomyopathy and
ovarian failure (212112), Nguyen et al. (2007) identified heterozygosity
for a de novo 176T-C transition in exon 1 of the LMNA gene, predicted to
result in a leu59-to-arg (L59R) substitution. Analysis of nuclear
morphology in patient fibroblasts showed more irregularity and variation
than that of control fibroblasts, with denting, blebbing, and irregular
margins. The mutation was not found in the unaffected parents or in 116
population-based controls.

In a 15-year-old Caucasian girl with dilated cardiomyopathy and ovarian
failure who died from an arrhythmia while awaiting cardiac
transplantation, McPherson et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for
the L59R mutation in the LMNA gene. The mutation was presumed to be de
novo, although the unaffected parents declined DNA testing. The patient
also had a healthy older sister, and there was no family history of
cardiomyopathy or hypogonadism.

.0053
CARDIOMYOPATHY, DILATED, 1A
LMNA, ARG541GLY

In 2 sibs with dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD1A; 115200), Malek et al.
(2011) identified a heterozygous 1621C-G transversion in exon 10 of the
LMNA gene, resulting in an arg541-to-gly (R541G) substitution in the
C-terminal tail region. The 23-year-old male proband had a history of
paroxysmal atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and was found by
echocardiogram to have dilation of the left ventricle and global
hypokinesis. Cardiac MRI showed discrete regional areas of akinesis with
muscle thinning in the left ventricle and marked hypertrabeculation in
dysfunctional regions, as well as evidence of fibrosis. The proband's
sister had sinus bradycardia and supraventricular and ventricular
arrhythmias, but normal echocardiogram and cardiac MRI. The sibs' father
and paternal aunt had both died of dilated cardiomyopathy. In vitro
functional expression studies showed that the R541G mutant resulted in
the formation of abnormal lamin aggregates, most of which were
sickle-shaped, suggesting aberrant formation of the inner nuclear lamina
from misassembled lamin dimers.

601769	TITLE *601769 VITAMIN D RECEPTOR; VDR
;;1,25-@DIHYDROXYVITAMIN D3 RECEPTOR;;
VITAMIN D HORMONE RECEPTOR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), which is synthesized in the epidermis in
response to ultraviolet radiation, and dietary vitamin D2
(ergocalciferol), which is synthesized in plants, are devoid of any
biologic activity. Vitamin D hormonal activity is due primarily to the
hydroxylated metabolite of vitamin D3, 1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
(1,25(OH)2D3, or calcitriol). Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is an
intracellular hormone receptor that specifically binds 1,25(OH)2D3 and
mediates its effects (summary by Baker et al. (1988), Liberman and Marx
(2001), and Koren (2006)).

CLONING

Baker et al. (1988) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the human vitamin D
receptor from a human intestinal cDNA library. The deduced 427-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 48.3 kD and belongs to
the superfamily of trans-acting transcriptional regulatory factors,
including the steroid and thyroid hormone receptors. The VDR protein
contains a zinc-finger DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domain
and a ligand-binding domain. VDR is closely related to the thyroid
hormone receptors. RNA blot hybridization indicated a single RNA species
of about 4.6 kb.

GENE STRUCTURE

Miyamoto et al. (1997) determined that the VDR gene contains 11 exons
and spans approximately 75 kb. The noncoding 5-prime end of the VDR gene
includes exons 1A, 1B, and 1C, while its translated product is encoded
by 8 additional exons (2-9). Three unique mRNA isoforms are produced as
a result of the differential splicing of exons 1B and 1C. The DNA
sequence upstream to exon 1A is GC-rich and does not contain an apparent
TATA box. Several potential binding sites for the transcription factor
SP1 (189906) and other activators were noted. An intron fragment 3-prime
of exon 1C conferred retinoic acid responsivity when fused to a reporter
gene plasmid.

Exons 2 and 3 of the VDR gene are involved in DNA binding, and exons 7,
8, and 9 are involved in binding to vitamin D (Hughes et al., 1988).

MAPPING

Faraco et al. (1989), who identified an ApaI dimorphism at the VDR
locus, assigned the VDR gene to chromosome 12 by somatic cell hybrid
studies. By study of rat/human somatic cell hybrids, Szpirer et al.
(1991) showed that the VDR gene is located on 12q in the human and
chromosome 7 in the rat. Labuda et al. (1991) assigned the VDR gene to
12q12-q14 by in situ hybridization. No recombination was found between
VDR and COL2A1 (120140; lod = 1.94) or ELA1 (130120; lod = 0.98) on
12q13. The COL2A1 and VDR loci are separated by less than 740 kb, with
VDR distal to COL2A1 (Pedeutour et al., 1994).

GENE FUNCTION

Using mutation analysis, Jurutka et al. (2000) characterized
arg18/arg22, VDR residues immediately N-terminal of the first
DNA-binding zinc finger, as vital for contact with the general
transcription factor IIB (TFIIB; 189963). A natural polymorphic variant
of VDR, termed F/M4 (missing a FokI restriction site), which lacks only
the first 3 amino acids (including glu2), interacted more efficiently
with TFIIB and also possessed elevated transcriptional activity compared
with the full-length (f/M1) receptor. The authors concluded that the
functioning of positively charged arg18/arg22 as part of a VDR docking
site for TFIIB is influenced by the composition of the adjacent
polymorphic N terminus. Increased transactivation by the F/M4 neomorphic
VDR was hypothesized to result from its demonstrated enhanced
association with TFIIB.

Makishima et al. (2002) demonstrated that the vitamin D receptor also
functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid,
which is hepatotoxic and a potential enteric carcinogen. The vitamin D
receptor is an order of magnitude more sensitive to lithocholic acid and
its metabolites than are other nuclear receptors. Activation of the
vitamin D receptor by lithocholic acid or vitamin D induced expression
in vivo of CYP3A (124010), a cytochrome P450 enzyme that detoxifies
lithocholic acid in the liver and intestine. Makishima et al. (2002)
suggested a mechanism that may explain the proposed protective effect of
vitamin D and its receptor against colon cancer.

Using retroviral transduction, Palmer et al. (2004) generated human
SW480-ADH colon cancer cells that ectopically express mouse
hemagglutinin-tagged Snai1 (604238) protein (SNAIL-HA). Overexpression
of Snai1 in these cells resulted in lower vitamin D receptor mRNA and
protein expression and inhibited induction of E-cadherin (192090) and
VDR by 1,25(OH)2D3. A 1,25(OH)2D3 analog inhibited tumor growth in
immunodeficient mice injected with mock cells, but not in those injected
with SNAIL-HA cells. In 32 paired samples of normal colon and tumor
tissue from patients undergoing colorectal surgery, Palmer et al. (2004)
found that high SNAI1 expression in tumor tissue correlated with
downregulation of VDR and E-cadherin (p = 0.007 and 0.0073,
respectively). Palmer et al. (2004) concluded that the balance between
VDR and SNAI1 expression is critical for E-cadherin expression, which
influences cell fate during colon cancer progression.

Healy et al. (2005) administered human PTH (168450) over 48 hours to
wildtype mice and observed a 15% reduction in renal VDR levels (p less
than 0.03). When the authors similarly administered PTH to CYP27B1
(609506)-null mice, which are incapable of endogenously producing
vitamin D hormone, they observed a 29% reduction in VDR levels (p less
than 0.001). Healy et al. (2005) concluded that PTH is a potent
downregulator of VDR expression in vivo.

Shah et al. (2006) stated that the signaling and oncogenic activity of
beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) can be repressed by activation of VDR.
Conversely, high levels of beta-catenin can potentiate the
transcriptional activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Shah et al. (2006)
showed that the effects of beta-catenin on VDR activity are due
interaction between the activator function-2 domain of VDR and the C
terminus of beta-catenin.

Pena et al. (2005) studied the expression and functional correlation of
the SNAI1, E-cadherin (CDH1; 192090), VDR, and ZEB1 (189909) genes and
examined their possible involvement in colon cancer. Their expression
was measured by real-time PCR in 114 patients with colorectal cancer,
and tumor characteristics were analyzed in each patient. SNAI1
expression was associated with downregulation of CDH1 (P = less than
0.001) and VDR (P = less than 0.001) gene products. There was a positive
correlation between CDH1 and VDR expressions, but the association
between SNAI1 and CDH1 was not found in patients with high expression of
ZEB1. There was a correlation between downregulation of: (a) ZEB1 and
presence of polyps in surgical resections; (b) VDR and poor
differentiation; and (c) CDH1 and poor differentiation, vascular
invasion, presence of lymph node metastases, and advanced stages; as
well as a trend toward a correlation between SNAI1 expression in tumors
and vascular invasion. Pena et al. (2005) suggested analyzing these
genes in colon cancer patients for prognostic purposes and for
predicting response to possible therapies with vitamin D or its analogs.

Using DNA microarray and quantitative PCR analyses, Liu et al. (2006)
found that activation of TLR2 (603028) and TLR1 (601194) by a
mycobacterial ligand upregulated expression of VDR and CYP27B1, the
vitamin D 1-hydroxylase that catalyzes the conversion of vitamin D to
its active form, in monocytes and macrophages, but not dendritic cells.
Intracellular flow cytometric and quantitative PCR analyses showed that
treatment of monocytes with vitamin D upregulated expression of CYP24
(CYP24A1; 126065), the vitamin D 24-hydroxylase, and cathelicidin (CAMP;
600474), an antimicrobial peptide, but not DEFB4 (602215). Confocal
microscopy demonstrated colocalization of CAMP with bacteria-containing
vacuoles of vitamin D-treated monocytes, and vitamin D treatment of M.
tuberculosis-infected macrophages reduced the number of viable bacilli.
Ligand stimulation of TLR2 and TLR1 upregulated CYP24 and CAMP in the
presence of human serum, but not bovine serum, and CAMP upregulation was
more efficient in Caucasian than in African American serum, in which
vitamin D levels were significantly lower. Vitamin D supplementation of
African American serum reversed the CAMP induction defect. Liu et al.
(2006) proposed that vitamin D supplementation in African and Asian
populations, which may have a reduced ability to synthesize vitamin D
from ultraviolet light in sunlight, might be an effective and
inexpensive intervention to enhance innate immunity against microbial
infection and neoplastic disease.

In a patient with a form of vitamin D-dependent rickets in which the
vitamin D receptor is intact (VDDR2B; 600785), Chen et al. (2003) found
overexpression of a nuclear response element-binding protein (REBiP)
that interacted with retinoid X receptor (RXR)-VDR heterodimers. Chen et
al. (2006) identified the nuclear protein in that patient as hnRNPC1/C2
(164020), and demonstrated that overexpression of hnRNP C1 and C2 in
vitamin D-responsive cells inhibited VDR-VDRE (vitamin D response
element)-directed transactivation by 23% and 42%, respectively (p less
than 0.005 for both). In contrast, transient expression of an hnRNP
C1/C2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased VDR transactivation by 39%
(p less than 0.005). Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed the
presence of REBiP in vitamin D-responsive human cells and indicated that
the normal pattern of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D-initiated cyclical
movement of the VDR on and off the VDRE is legislated by competitive,
reciprocal occupancy of the VDRE by hnRNP C1/C2. The temporal and
reciprocal pattern of VDR and hnRNP C1/C2 interaction with the VDRE was
lost in VDDR2B cells overexpressing the hnRNP C1/C2 REBiP. Chen et al.
(2006) suggested that hnRNP C1/C2 may be a key determinant of the
temporal patterns of VDRE occupancy.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, Zhang et al. (2003) showed
that endogenous Skip (SKIIP; 603055), a putative VDR coactivator,
colocalized with Vdr on VDREs in rat osteosarcoma cells. Crosslinking
and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that endogenous Vdr, Src1
(NCOA1; 602691), and Skip associated with VDREs in the rat Cyp24a1
promoter following treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3. Protein pull-down assays,
followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, revealed that human SKIP
interacted with several components of the spliceosome in HeLa cell
nuclear extracts. Expression of a dominant-negative SKIP in COS-7 cells
interfered with proper splicing of transcripts derived from a growth
hormone (GH1; 139250) minigene in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment.
Zhang et al. (2003) concluded that SKIP couples VDR-mediated
transcription to RNA splicing.

In kidney, the level of 1,25(OH)2D3 is controlled by product inhibition,
in which 1,25(OH)2D3 itself, acting through VDR, represses the
1,25(OH)2D3-synthesizing enzyme CYP27B1. Turunen et al. (2007) confirmed
that CYP27B1 was downregulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 via VDR in kidney-derived
HEK293 cells. They showed that inhibition of CYP27B1 by 1,25(OH)2D3 in
HEK293 cells involved interaction of liganded VDR with a negative VDRE
(nVDRE) in the proximal promoter near the CYP27B1 transcriptional start
site and with 2 classical VDREs far upstream of the transcriptional
start site. Both upstream VDREs bound VDR-RXR heterodimers in a
ligand-dependent manner, whereas the nVDRE in the proximal promoter did
not bind VDR-RXR heterodimers directly, but rather bound VDR-interacting
repressor (VDIR, or TCF3; 147141). Turunen et al. (2007) also found that
regulation of CYP27B1 expression in HEK293 cells involved chromatin
looping between the upstream and proximal VDREs.

Chun et al. (2008) reviewed the cellular and molecular mechanisms
associated with vitamin D, including a role for vitamin D in modulating
innate and adaptive immunities. Citing evidence that nonclassic vitamin
D physiology involves localized intracrine modes of action, they
suggested that established models for vitamin D signal transduction
based on endocrine mechanisms are incomplete.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Uitterlinden et al. (2004) reviewed the genetics of vitamin D receptor
polymorphisms and their associated biologic effects.

- Vitamin D-Dependent Rickets Type 2A

In 2 patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A (VDDR2A; 277440),
Hughes et al. (1988) identified 2 different mutations in the VDR gene
(601769.0001 and 601769.0002). Hughes et al. (1988) suggested that this
was the first molecular identification of a disease-producing mutation
in a steroid hormone receptor gene. (Mutations were found at about the
same time in the androgen receptor; see 313700.)

Saijo et al. (1991) noted that different mutations in the VDR gene have
been specific for particular ethnic groups: Arabian (601769.0002 and
601769.0003), Haitian (601769.0001), North African (601769.0004), and
Japanese (601769.0005).

Miller et al. (2001) reported a patient with type 2A vitamin D-resistant
rickets who was compound heterozygous for 2 mutations in the VDR gene
(601769.0013, 601769.0014). Similar to patients with mutations in HR
(602302), follicular remnants in this patient's skin appeared to possess
hair follicle stem cells, some of which generated cutaneous cysts. These
and other findings suggested that VDR and HR, which are both zinc finger
proteins, may be in the same genetic pathway that controls postnatal
cycling of the hair follicle.

In the proband of a consanguineous Bedouin family with alopecia and skin
papules, vitamin D-dependent rickets, and deafness, Arita et al. (2008)
identified homozygosity for a missense mutation in the VDR gene
(601769.0015). The mutation was also present in homozygosity in 2
similarly affected sibs from whom DNA was available; the unaffected
parents and 3 unaffected sibs were heterozygous for the change, which
was not found in 100 ethnically matched control chromosomes. Arita et
al. (2008) stated that this was the first reported case of VDDR with
deafness.

- Role in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and Osteoporosis

Studies on the role of polymorphisms in the VDR gene in the
determination of bone mineral density have been conflicting. Most of the
studies (see below) identified the restriction fragment length
polymorphisms (RFLPs) Bb, Tt, Aa, and Ff, as defined by the
endonucleases BsmI, TaqI, and ApaI, FokI, respectively. The lowercase
allele contains the restriction site, whereas the uppercase allele does
not.

Calcitriol, the active hormonal form of vitamin D, acts through the
vitamin D receptor and a specific vitamin D-responsive element to induce
the synthesis of osteocalcin (BGLAP; 112260), the most abundant
noncollagenous protein in bone. In studies of twins, variation in serum
osteocalcin levels was shown to have a major genetic component (Kelly et
al., 1991) and to be closely correlated with the genetic diversity in
bone density (Pocock et al., 1987). Morrison et al. (1992) presented
evidence suggesting that VDR polymorphisms may influence serum levels of
osteocalcin.

Among 311 healthy women from Sydney, 207 of whom were postmenopausal,
Morrison et al. (1994) found an association between the BB VDR genotype
and lower bone mineral density. However, Hustmyer et al. (1994) found no
relationship between several VDR polymorphisms and bone mineral density
at spine, femur, and forearm among 86 monozygotic and 39 dizygotic adult
female twin pairs. In Korea, Lim et al. (1995) found that no patients
with osteoporosis had the BB genotype. In a study in the northeast of
Scotland, Houston et al. (1996) found that individuals with the BB
genotype had a higher femoral neck bone density than individuals with
the bb genotype, the opposite of the finding in the study of Morrison et
al. (1994). Among 44 patients with severe osteoporosis with vertebral
compression fractures, Houston et al. (1996) found no association with
the VDR genotype.

Garnero et al. (1996) found no relationship between VDR genotype and
bone mass, bone turnover, or bone loss among 268 untreated
postmenopausal women. Ensrud et al. (1999) found no association between
VDR genotype and fracture risk among 9,704 women aged 65 years or older.

Among a group of prepubertal American girls of Mexican descent, Sainz et
al. (1997) found that girls with the aa and bb genotypes had 2 to 3%
higher femoral bone density and an 8 to 10% higher vertebral bone
density than girls with AA and BB genotypes. However, there was no
association between the cross-sectional area of the vertebrae or the
cross-sectional or cortical area of the femur and the vitamin D receptor
genotype. Riggs (1997) quoted a remark by Charles Dent of University
College, London, that 'senile osteoporosis is a pediatric disease.'

Among healthy prepubertal white Australian children aged 7 years, Tao et
al. (1998) found that females homozygous for the t Taq1 allele had lower
BMD than TT homozygotes in certain bone regions; tt homozygotes were
also significantly shorter and lighter. These effects were not observed
in males. The authors suggested that the VDR may play a more important
role in trabecular bone than in cortical bone, and that VDR allelic
variation might be responsible for some of the variation in BMD and
postnatal growth in prepubertal girls.

In a group of men, Ferrari et al. (1999) found that BB homozygotes had
significantly lower BMD only in subjects also carrying the f allele at
the VDR 5-prime polymorphic site (FokI). Serum PTH levels were
significantly higher in the BB genotype at baseline and remained so
under either a low or a high calcium-phosphorus diet. Moreover, on the
low calcium-phosphorus diet, BB subjects had significantly decreased
tubular Pi reabsorptive capacity and plasma Pi levels. The authors
emphasized the importance of identifying multiple single-base mutation
polymorphisms, and suggested a role for environmental/dietary factor
interactions with VDR gene polymorphisms in peak bone mineral mass in
men.

Uitterlinden et al. (2001) found that a haplotype represented by
polymorphisms in the VDR gene and the presence of the COL1A1 gene
Sp1-binding site polymorphism 2046G-T (120150.0051) exhibited a combined
influence on osteoporotic fracture risk, independent of BMD.

Among 426 Italian postmenopausal women, Gennari et al. (1998) found an
association between certain VDR polymorphisms and lumbar spine BMD as
well as the development of osteoporosis. Colin et al. (2003) studied the
combined influence of polymorphisms in both the estrogen receptor gene
(ESR1; 133430) and the VDR gene on the susceptibility to osteoporotic
vertebral fractures in 634 women aged 55 years and older. Three VDR
haplotypes (1, 2, and 3) of the BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI RFLPs and 3 ESR1
haplotypes (1, 2, and 3) of the PvuII and XbaI RFLPs were identified.
ESR1 haplotype-1 was dose-dependently associated with increased
vertebral fracture risk corresponding to an odds ratio of 1.9 (95% CI,
0.9-4.1) per copy of the risk allele. VDR haplotype-1 was also
overrepresented in vertebral fracture cases. These associations were
independent of BMD.

Nejentsev et al. (2004) studied population differences in
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the VDR gene. Fang et al.
(2005) determined sequence variation across the major relevant parts of
VDR, including construction of linkage disequilibrium blocks and
identification of haplotype alleles. They analyzed 15 haplotype-tagging
SNPs in relation to 937 clinical fractures recorded in 6,148 elderly
whites over a follow-up period of 7.4 years. Haplotype alleles of the
promoter region and of the 3-prime untranslated region (UTR) was
strongly associated with increased fracture risk. For the 16% of
subjects who had risk genotypes at both regions, their risk increased
48% for clinical fractures (P = 0.0002), independent of age, sex,
height, weight, and bone mineral density. The population-attributable
risk varied between 1% and 12% for each block and was 4% for the
combined VDR risk genotypes. Fang et al. (2005) showed further a 30%
increased mRNA decay in an osteoblast cell line for a construct carrying
the 3-prime-UTR risk haplotype (P = 0.02). This comprehensive candidate
gene analysis demonstrated that the risk allele of multiple VDR
polymorphisms results in lower VDR mRNA levels. This could impact the
vitamin D signaling efficiency and might contribute to the increased
fracture risk observed for these risk haplotype alleles.

In a multicenter large-scale association study of over 26,000
individuals enrolled from 9 European teams, Uitterlinden et al. (2006)
found no association between bone mineral densities at the lumbar spine
and femoral neck or fracture risk and the FokI, BsmI, ApaI, or TaqI VDR
polymorphisms. There was a modest risk reduction (9%) for vertebral
fractures associated with the Cdx2 promoter A allele (dbSNP rs11568820).

Garnero et al. (2005) investigated the relationships between VDR
genotypes and fracture risk. A total of 589 postmenopausal women (mean
age, 62 years) were followed prospectively during a median
(interquartile) of 11 (1.1) years. VDR allele B was significantly and
dose dependently overrepresented in women who fractured, including 34
and 86 women with first incident vertebral and nonvertebral fragility
fractures, respectively. This corresponded to an odds ratio of 1.5 (95%
confidence interval, 0.95-2.40) for heterozygous carriers (bB, n = 286)
and 2.10 (95% confidence interval, 1.16-3.79) for homozygous carriers
(BB, n = 90) of the B allele, compared with women with the bb genotype
(n = 213). The authors concluded that VDR genotypes are associated with
the risk of fracture in postmenopausal women independently of BMD, rate
of postmenopausal forearm BMD loss, bone turnover, and endogenous
hormones.

- Role in Height and Overall Growth

Among 589 healthy 2-year-old infants, Suarez et al. (1997) found that
homozygous BB girls had higher length, weight, and body surface area,
and inversely, BB boys had lower weight, body mass index, and body
surface area, than their respective bb counterparts. As a result,
gender-related differences were observed in Bb and bb, but not in BB
populations. These associations with VDR genotype were also observed at
birth and at 10 months of age in the longitudinal analysis of 145
selected full-term babies homozygous for the BsmI polymorphism. The
authors concluded that the VDR genotype may influence intrauterine and
early postnatal growth.

Among 90 healthy Caucasian males, Lorentzon et al. (2000) found that
boys with the BB VDR genotype were shorter at birth and grew less from
birth until after puberty than their Bb and bb counterparts. The BB boys
had lower bone area of the humerus, femur, and total body (p less than
0.05) than the Bb and bb boys; however, the VDR polymorphisms were not
related to BMD at any site. The authors concluded that a prediction
model including parental height, birth height, birth weight, and VDR
alleles could predict up to 39% of the total variation in adult height
in their study population. The VDR allelic variants alone contributed to
8% of the total variation. See STQTL3 (606257).

In a study of 1,873 white subjects from 406 nuclear families, Xiong et
al. (2005) found within-family associations with height at BsmI and TaqI
loci (p = 0.048 and 0.039, respectively). Analyses based on BsmI/TaqI
haplotypes showed linkage (p = 0.05) and association (p = 0.001) with
height. The bT haplotype had the most significant and consistent total
and within-family associations (p = 0.0006 and 0.033, respectively), and
subjects with the bT haplotype were an average of 1% (1.6 cm) taller
than those without it (p = 0.003). The authors noted that this
association might be female-specific and influenced by menstrual status.
Xiong et al. (2005) suggested that VDR may be linked to and associated
with adult height variation in white populations.

D'Alesio et al. (2005) studied the -1521G-C and -1012A-G polymorphisms
located in the VDR promoter region upstream of the transcriptional start
site. A nucleotide change at either SNP led to a dramatic change in
protein-DNA complex formation in nuclear extracts from various cell
lines. Genetic analysis of 185 healthy adolescent girls yielded 3 main
genotypes: homozygous for 1521G/1012A (21.1%), homozygous for
1521C/1012G (17.3%), and heterozygous 1521CG/1012GA (57.3%). Clinical
and biological association studies in the adolescent cohort showed that
girls with a CC/GG genotype had lower circulating levels of
25-dihydroxyvitamin D, with no detectable consequence on calcium
metabolism, lower serum IGF1 (147440) levels, and lower height from 11
years of age to adulthood.

- Role in Hyperparathyroidism

Among 206 Caucasian patients with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism
(see 145000), Carling et al. (1997) found that the VDR b, a, and T
alleles were overrepresented in 100 menopausal females with sporadic
hyperparathyroidism equivalent. Hyperparathyroidism appeared to be
unrelated to the VDR polymorphisms in patients with hyperparathyroidism
of multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1; 131100) and patients with
hyperparathyroidism of uremia. By in vitro studies of parathyroid
adenomas, Carling et al. (1997) found an association between
calcium-mediated PTH secretion and inhibition suppression and VDR
genotype. Carling et al. (1998) found that parathyroid tumors from
patients homozygous for the VDR b, a, or T alleles showed significantly
lower VDR and higher PTH mRNA levels than those from patients with BB,
AA, or tt genotypes (p less than 0.0001-0.02), whereas those from
heterozygotes had intermediate values. A similar discrepancy was found
when comparing the baT and non-baT haplotypes (0.042 +/- 0.005 vs 0.064
+/- 0.004 for VDR; 34.4 +/- 3.7 vs 21.6 +/- 2.2 for PTH; both p less
than 0.005). The authors concluded that the lower VDR mRNA levels
associated with the b, a, and T alleles may affect the
calcitriol-mediated control of parathyroid function and thereby
contribute to the development of sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism.

Correa et al. (1999) found no association between the VDR FokI
polymorphism and the development of sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism
among 182 postmenopausal women compared to controls. There were no
significant associations with age, serum calcium, serum PTH, BMD, or
parathyroid tumor weight. The authors concluded that the FokI
polymorphism has at most a minor pathogenic importance in the
development of the disorder.

- Other Disease Associations

Uitterlinden et al. (1997) found overrepresentation of 1 VDR haplotype
and radiographic osteoarthritis and osteophytes at the knee. Adjustment
for bone density at the femoral neck did not change these results,
indicating that the association was not mediated by bone density. The
authors raised the possibility of linkage disequilibrium with the
closely situated COL2A1 gene, which encodes cartilage collagen.

Among 104 Korean patients with psoriasis (177900), Park et al. (1999)
found a significant increase in the frequency of the VDR A polymorphism
compared to controls. This tendency was more marked in early-onset
psoriasis. Derived allele frequencies on the basis of Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium for A and a were 0.317 and 0.683 in the psoriasis group and
0.168 and 0.832 in the control group, respectively, while in the
early-onset group, A increased to 0.354.

Ban et al. (2000) presented evidence suggesting an association between
the VDR B polymorphism and Japanese patients with Graves disease
(275000).

Motohashi et al. (2003) found a significantly higher frequency of the
VDR B allele among 203 patients with acute onset of type I diabetes
(222100) compared with 222 controls (p = 0.0010).

Selvaraj et al. (2004) presented evidence suggesting that polymorphisms
in the VDR gene may predispose to spinal tuberculosis (TB; see 607948).

Bornman et al. (2004) genotyped the VDR SNPs FokI, BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI
in TB patients, controls, and families in the Gambia, Guinea, and
Guinea-Bissau. By transmission-disequilibrium analysis of family data,
they found a significant global association of TB with the SNP
combinations FokI-BsmI-ApaI-TaqI and FokI-ApaI driven by increased
transmission of the F and A alleles in combination to affected
offspring. Case-control analysis showed no significant association
between TB and VDR variants. Bornman et al. (2004) concluded that there
is a haplotype, rather than a genotype, association between VDR variants
and susceptibility to TB.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yoshizawa et al. (1997) found that VDR-null mice displayed no defect in
development and growth before weaning, irrespective of reduced
expression of vitamin D target genes. After weaning, however, mutants
failed to thrive, with appearance of alopecia, hypocalcemia, and
infertility, and bone formation was severely impaired as a typical
feature of vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2. Unlike humans with this
disease, most of the VDR-null mice died within 15 weeks after birth, and
uterine hypoplasia with impaired folliculogenesis was found in female
reproductive organs. These defects, such as alopecia and uterine
hypoplasia, were not observed in vitamin D-deficient animals. Uterine
hypoplasia was shown to be due to lack of estrogen synthesis in the
mutant ovaries; the uterus in these animals responded normally to
administration of estrogen. Male reproductive organs appeared normal in
VDR-null mice. Uterine hypoplasia, infertility, and early lethality are
not pronounced in patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2,
possibly because of therapy with calcium supplements. The higher content
of calcium in murine milk than in human milk may keep serum calcium
levels normal, thereby ensuring normal growth of VDR-null mice before
weaning. The findings of Yoshizawa et al. (1997) established a critical
role for VDR in growth, bone formation, and female reproduction in the
postweaning stage.

The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, modulates the immune
response in Th1-related diseases. Using an experimental allergic asthma
model, Wittke et al. (2004) found that, apart from upregulation of 2
Th2-related genes, 1,25(OH)2D3 had no affect on asthma severity in
wildtype mice. Asthma-induced Vdr-deficient mice, however, failed to
develop airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, or
eosinophilia, despite high IgE concentrations and elevated Th2
cytokines. Wittke et al. (2004) suggested that the vitamin D endocrine
system has an important role in the development of Th2-driven
inflammation in the lung.

During development and postnatal growth of the endochondral skeleton,
proliferative chondrocytes differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes,
which subsequently undergo apoptosis and are replaced by bone. Donohue
and Demay (2002) found that Vdr-null mice who developed rickets had
expansion of hypertrophic chondrocytes due to impaired apoptosis of
these cells. Sabbagh et al. (2005) showed that institution of a rescue
diet that restored mineral ion homeostasis in Vdr-null mice prevented
the development of rachitic changes, indicating that mineral ion
abnormalities, not ablation of the Vdr gene, were the cause of impaired
chondrocyte apoptosis. Similarly, 'Hyp' mice with rickets due to
mutation in the Phex gene (300550) also showed impaired apoptosis of
hypertrophic chondrocytes, and the decreased apoptosis was correlated
with hypophosphatemia. Wildtype mice rendered hypercalcemic and
hypophosphatemic by dietary means also developed rickets. In vitro
studies showed that the apoptosis was mediated by caspase-9 (CASP9;
602234). Sabbagh et al. (2005) concluded that hypophosphatemia was the
common mediator of rickets in these mice. The findings indicated that
normal phosphorus levels are required for growth plate maturation and
that circulating phosphate is a key regulator of hypertrophic
chondrocyte apoptosis.

Masuyama et al. (2006) generated mice with conditional inactivation of
Vdr in chondrocytes. Growth-plate chondrocyte development was not
affected by lack of Vdr, but vascular invasion was impaired, and
osteoclast number was reduced in juvenile mice, resulting in increased
trabecular bone mass. Vdr signaling in chondrocytes directly regulated
osteoclastogenesis by inducing Rankl (TNFSF11; 602642) expression.
Mineral homeostasis was also affected in mutant mice. In vivo and in
vitro analysis indicated that Vdr inactivation in chondrocytes reduced
expression of Fgf23 (605380) by osteoblasts and consequently led to
increased renal expression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) and
sodium/phosphate cotransporter type IIA (SLC34A1; 182309). Masuyama et
al. (2006) concluded that VDR signaling in chondrocytes is required for
timely osteoclast formation during bone development and for endocrine
action of bone in phosphate homeostasis.

Froicu et al. (2006) compared mice lacking Il10 (124092), which develop
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; see 266600), with double-knockout (DKO)
mice lacking Il10 and Vdr. They observed normal thymic development and
peripheral T-cell numbers in DKO mice up to 3 weeks of age. However,
following onset of IBD, the thymus became dysplastic with reduced
cellularity and increased apoptosis. Spleen weight increased due to red
blood cell accumulation, but there was a 50% reduction in lymphocytes.
In contrast, mesenteric lymph nodes of DKO mice were enlarged and had
increased lymphocyte numbers. DKO T cells were hyporesponsive. RT-PCR
detected overexpression of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL1B; 147720)
in DKO colon. Froicu et al. (2006) concluded that Vdr expression is
required for T-cell control of inflammation in Il10-deficient mice.

Yu and Cantorna (2008) showed that mice lacking Vdr have intrinsically
defective and reduced numbers of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells
with diminished responses to alpha-galactosylceramide presented in the
context of CD1d (188410). These iNKT cells also show defective
maturation and reduced thymic expression of CD1d, and lack Tbet
(604895), but not CD122 (IL2RB; 146710), expression.

Quigley et al. (2009) integrated germline polymorphisms with gene
expression in normal skin from a M. musculus x M. spretus backcross to
generate a network view of the gene expression architecture of mouse
skin. They identified expression motifs that contribute to tissue
organization and biologic functions related to inflammation,
hematopoiesis, cell cycle control, and tumor susceptibility. Motifs
associated with inflammation, epidermal barrier function, and
proliferation were differentially regulated in backcross mice
susceptible or resistant to tumor development. The vitamin D receptor
(VDR) was linked to coordinated control of epidermal barrier function,
inflammation, and tumor susceptibility.

HISTORY

Kitagawa et al. (2003) identified a human multiprotein complex that
directly interacts with VDR through WSTF (605681). They designated the
complex WINAC (WSTF-including nucleosome assembly complex) and
determined that it contains as least 13 components. Due to errors
resulting in the failure of several figure panels to report the original
data, the paper of Kitagawa et al. (2003) was retracted (Kitagawa et
al., 2012).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, GLY33ASP

In 2 affected sisters from a black Haitian family with vitamin
D-dependent rickets type 2A (277440), Hughes et al. (1988) identified a
G-to-A transition in exon 2 of the VDR gene, resulting in a gly30-to-asp
(GLY30ASP) substitution near the tip of the first zinc finger. Based on
corrected sequencing, the mutation is gly33 to asp.

.0002
VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, ARG73GLN

In 2 affected brothers from an Arab family living in the Middle East
with vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A (277440), Hughes et al. (1988)
identified a mutation in the VDR gene, resulting in an arg70-to-gly
(ARG70GLY) substitution at the tip of the second zinc finger of the
vitamin D receptor. Based on corrected sequencing, the mutation is arg73
to gln.

.0003
VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, TYR292TER

In 4 affected children from 3 related Middle Eastern Arabic families
with a classic form of vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A (277440) and
absence of detectable binding of vitamin D to the vitamin D receptor in
cultured fibroblasts or lymphoblasts, Ritchie et al. (1989) identified a
970C-A transversion in exon 7 of the VDR gene, resulting in a
tyr292-to-ter (Y292X) substitution. The Y292X mutation caused a
truncation of the VDR protein, thereby deleting a large portion of the
steroid hormone-binding domain (amino acids 292-424). The 4 parents
tested showed both wildtype and mutant alleles. Also see Malloy et al.
(1990).

.0004
VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, ARG77GLN

In 2 unrelated patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A
(277440), Sone et al. (1990) identified a homozygous 327G-A transition
in exon 3 of the VDR gene, resulting in an arg77-to-gln (R77Q)
substitution at a highly conserved residue. In vitro functional
expression studies showed that the R77Q mutant receptor bound
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with normal affinity, but displayed weak
affinity for the nuclear fraction and for heterologous DNA.
Significantly, the protein was inactive in promoting transcription in a
cotransfection assay using a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene
reporter fused downstream of the VDR-inducible osteocalcin gene
promoter-enhancer. The patients were of North African ancestry.

.0005
VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, ARG47GLN

Takeda et al. (1989) described 2 sibs, children of first-cousin parents,
with vitamin D-dependent rickets with alopecia (277440). In these 2 sibs
and in another patient with VDDR2A, Saijo et al. (1991) identified a
140G-A transition in exon 3 of the VDR gene, resulting in an
arg47-to-gln (R47Q) substitution between 2 zinc fingers. The affected
residue is conserved in all steroid hormone receptors. Single-strand
conformation polymorphism analysis of amplified DNA confirmed that all 3
patients were homozygous and that parents from 1 family were
heterozygous carriers.

.0006
VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, GLN149TER

In a child of Middle Eastern origin with vitamin D-dependent rickets
type 2A (277440), Kristjansson et al. (1993) identified a C-to-T
transition in the VDR gene, resulting in a gln149-to-ter (Q149X)
substitution in the hinge region of the protein. The child was born of
consanguineous parents. Functional expression analyses showed that the
Q149X mutant receptor was unable to induce transcription of the
osteocalcin hormone gene response element at low levels of vitamin D.

.0007
VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, ARG271LEU

In a boy of Middle Eastern origin with vitamin D-dependent rickets type
2A (277440) but with normal hair growth, who was originally reported by
Fraher et al. (1986), Kristjansson et al. (1993) identified a G-to-T
transversion in the VDR gene, resulting in an arg271-to-leu (R271L)
substitution in the steroid-binding domain of the receptor. Functional
expression studies showed that although the R271L mutation was unable to
induce transcription of the osteocalcin hormone gene response element at
low levels of vitamin D, it showed normal transcription responses in the
presence of 1,000-fold higher vitamin D concentrations than needed for
the wildtype receptor. This showed that arginine-271 directly affects
the affinity of VDR for its ligand, and its conversion to leucine
decreases its affinity for vitamin D by a factor of 1,000. Arginine-271
is located immediately 3-prime to a 30-amino acid segment that is
conserved among members of the steroid/thyroid/retinoid hormone receptor
superfamily.

.0008
VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, GLY46ASP

In a Saudi Arabian child with vitamin D-resistant rickets type 2A
(277440) with consanguineous parents, Lin et al. (1996) identified a
G-to-A transition in exon 2 of the VDR gene, resulting in a gly46-to-asp
(G46D) substitution. Functional expression studies showed that the
mutant receptor displayed normal binding affinity for 1,25-(OH)2D3, but
had reduced affinity for DNA binding. The mutant VDR was unable to
activate gene transcription in cells treated with up to 100 nmol/L of
1,25-(OH)2D3. Thus this mutation, which occurs in the first zinc finger
of the DNA-binding domain of the receptor, blocks 1,25-(OH)2D3 action.

.0009
VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, HIS305GLN

Van Maldergem et al. (1996) reported an 8.5-year-old Turkish boy, born
of first-cousin parents, who had 3 different disorders: congenital
lipoatrophic diabetes (269700), persistent mullerian ducts (261550), and
vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A (277440). In this boy, Malloy et al.
(1997) identified a homozygous mutation in the VDR gene, resulting in a
his305-to-gln (H305Q) substitution in the ligand-binding domain of the
vitamin D receptor. The mutation caused hereditary vitamin D-resistant
rickets due to decreased affinity for 1,25(OH)2D3. The disorder could be
effectively treated with extremely high doses of hormone. As pictured by
Van Maldergem et al. (1996) in their Figure 2, the patient did not have
alopecia but was hirsute, with hypertrichosis of the face and acanthosis
nigricans and pachydermia in the axillae. The hands suggested acrogeria,
and in general the patient had a prematurely aged appearance.

.0010
VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, ILE314SER

In a patient with vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A (277440),
Whitfield et al. (1996) identified a mutation in the VDR gene, resulting
in an ile314-to-ser (I314S) substitution in the hormone-binding domain
of the protein. The mutation caused decreased 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent
transactivation of the VDR and impaired heterodimeric interaction with
the retinoid X receptor (RXR; see 180247). However, the transactivation
ability of the I314S mutant receptor could be partially restored by
providing excess 1,25-(OH)2D3; clinically, the patient had a nearly
complete response to pharmacologic doses of a vitamin D derivative.

.0011
VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, ARG391CYS

In a patient with vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A (277440),
Whitfield et al. (1996) identified a mutation in the VDR gene, resulting
in an arg391-to-cys (R391C) substitution in the hormone-binding domain
of the protein. The mutation caused decreased 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent
transactivation of the VDR and impaired heterodimeric interaction with
the retinoid X receptor (RXR; see 180247). The patient responded only
partially to pharmacologic doses of a vitamin D derivative.

.0012
VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, ARG30TER

In affected patients from a Brazilian family with vitamin D-dependent
rickets type 2A with alopecia (277440), Mechica et al. (1997) identified
a homozygous 88C-T transition in exon 2 of the VDR gene, resulting in an
arg30-to-ter (R30X) substitution in the first zinc finger of the
DNA-binding domain, truncating the VDR by 397 residues. The mutation
occurred at a CpG dinucleotide. The propositus, a 12-year-old boy born
to first-cousin parents, had early-onset rickets, total alopecia,
convulsions, hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and elevated
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 serum levels. His younger sister also developed
clinical and biochemical features of the disorder at 1 month of age but
died at 4 years of age.

Zhu et al. (1998) described a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 218 (as
opposed to nucleotide 88 cited by Mechica et al., 1997) of the VDR cDNA
of a French Canadian boy with vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A born
to nonconsanguineous parents. The single-base substitution changed the
codon for arginine (CGA) to an opal stop codon (TGA), resulting in the
truncation of the VDR protein at amino acid 30. The result was
truncation of 398 amino acids including most of the zinc fingers as well
as the entire ligand-binding domain. Both parents were heterozygous for
the mutant allele. The child showed early-onset rickets, hypocalcemia,
secondary hyperparathyroidism, and elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
levels as well as total alopecia. (The other stop codons are referred to
as amber (TAG) and ochre (TAA). See 141900.0312 for an account of the
history of this colorful system of designation.)

VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, 1-BP DEL, 366C

In a patient with vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A with alopecia
(277440), Miller et al. (2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the VDR gene: a 1-bp deletion (366delC) in exon 4,
resulting in premature termination, and a 985G-A transition in exon 8,
resulting in a glu329-to-lys (E329K; 601769.0014) substitution. Miller
et al. (2001) characterized the alopecia associated with the disorder as
clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from that seen in
generalized atrichia with papular lesions (209500).

VITAMIN D-DEPENDENT RICKETS, TYPE 2A
VDR, VAL346MET

In a 6-year-old boy with alopecia and skin papules, vitamin D-dependent
rickets, and deafness (277440), Arita et al. (2008) identified
homozygosity for a 1036G-A transition in exon 11 of the VDR gene,
resulting in a val346-to-met (V346M) substitution at a conserved residue
in the ligand-binding domain. The mutation was also present in
homozygosity in 2 similarly affected sibs from whom DNA was available;
the unaffected parents and 3 unaffected sibs were heterozygous for the
change, which was not found in 100 ethnically matched control
chromosomes.

605453	TITLE *605453 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 9; ABCB9
DESCRIPTION For background information on the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of
transporter proteins, see ABCA4 (601691). In addition to the 'full' ABC
transporters with 2 transmembrane domains and 2 nucleotide-binding
domains, there are 'half' proteins that contain only 1 of each domain
(e.g., ABCB1; 171050). Full transporters are usually found in the plasma
membrane, whereas half transporters are found in subcellular organelles.

By searching an EST database and screening a T-lymphoblast cDNA library,
Zhang et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA encoding ABCB9. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 766-amino acid ABCB9 protein has 10 potential
N-terminal transmembrane segments. ABCB9 shares 94% identity with the
rodent sequences and is approximately 39% identical to 2 human
endoplasmic reticulum half transporters, TAP1 (ABCB2; 170260) and TAP2
(ABCB3; 170261). RT-PCR and genomic sequence analysis established the
existence of a splice variant with a 129-bp deletion expressed in testis
and brain. Northern blot analysis detected low expression of a 3.7-kb
transcript in most tissues tested, with an additional 2.2-kb transcript
detected in tissues with relatively high expression, such as testis.
Western blot analysis showed expression of a 72-kD nonglycosylated
protein, significantly smaller than the predicted mass of 84.5 kD, that
was enriched in lysosomes. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of ABCB9 with the lysosomal proteins LAMP1 (153330) and
LAMP2 (309060). Immunohistochemical analysis detected ABCB9 expression
in Sertoli cells of rodent seminiferous tubules.

Allikmets et al. (1996) mapped an EST corresponding to the ABCB9 gene to
12q24.

;;PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE 1C; PTP1C;;
TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE SHP1; SHP1;;
HEMATOPOIETIC CELL PHOSPHATASE; HCPH
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The growth and functional responses of hematopoietic cells are regulated
through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins. Using a PCR approach, Yi
et al. (1991) identified 3 novel tyrosine protein phosphatases in
hematopoietic cells. One of these, expressed predominantly in
hematopoietic cells, was termed hematopoietic cell phosphatase (HCPH).
From a pre-B-cell-derived library, Matthews et al. (1992) cloned the
mouse PTPN6 cDNA, which they designated SHP (Src homology region
2-domain phosphatase). Yi et al. (1992) obtained complete cDNAs for both
the human and murine HCPH genes. The human gene was also cloned from a
breast cancer cell line and termed PTP1C by Shen et al. (1991). PTP1C
encodes a cytoplasmic protein that contains a phosphatase-catalytic
domain in the C-terminal region and 2 tandemly repeated, src-homology 2
(SH2) domains in the N-terminal region. SH2 domains were first
identified in the SRC gene family and found in a variety of proteins
involved in signal transduction. The SH2 domains may recognize
phosphorylated tyrosine residues and direct protein-protein
associations.

GENE STRUCTURE

Banville et al. (1995) demonstrated that the PTPN6 gene consists of 17
exons spanning 17 kb of DNA. Three nonhematopoietic PTPN6 transcripts
were identified in a variety of cell lines and were shown to be
transcribed from a common promoter. The hematopoietic form of the PTPN6
transcript is initiated at a downstream promoter separated by 7 kb from
the upstream promoter. This downstream promoter is active exclusively in
cells of the hematopoietic lineage.

MAPPING

Yi et al. (1992) mapped the human HCPH gene to chromosome 12p13-p12 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By study of panels of somatic cell
hybrids and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Plutzky et al. (1992)
determined that the gene encoding the nontransmembrane protein-tyrosine
phosphatase of the nonreceptor type 6 is located in region 12p13.

Using a genomic probe in interspecific backcross analysis, Yi et al.
(1992) mapped the murine Hcph gene to chromosome 6 where it was found to
be tightly linked to the Tnfr2 and Ly4 genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Plutzky et al. (1992) suggested that since PTPN6 is expressed at high
levels in hematopoietic cells of all lineages and its expression is
induced early in hematopoietic differentiation, and since 12p13 is a
region commonly involved in leukemia-associated chromosomal
abnormalities, altered expression and/or structure of PTPN6 may play a
role in leukemogenesis.

T-cell lymphomas lose expression of SHP1 due to DNA methylation of its
promoter. Zhang et al. (2005) demonstrated that malignant T cells
expressed DNMT1 (126375) and that STAT3 (102582) could bind sites in the
SHP1 promoter in vitro. STAT3, DNMT1, and HDAC1 (601241) formed
complexes and bound to the SHP1 promoter in vivo. Antisense DNMT1 and
STAT3 small interfering RNA induced DNA demethylation in malignant T
cells and expression of SHP1. Zhang et al. (2005) concluded that STAT3
may transform cells by inducing epigenetic silencing of SHP1 in
cooperation with DNMT1 and HDAC1.

Combining computer modeling and single-cell measurements, Feinerman et
al. (2008) examined how endogenous variation in the expression levels of
signaling proteins might affect antigen responsiveness during T-cell
activation. They found that the CD8 (186910) coreceptor fine-tuned
activation thresholds, whereas SHP1 digitally regulated cell
responsiveness. Stochastic variation in expression of these proteins
generated substantial diversity of activation within a clonal population
of T cells, but coregulation of CD8 and SHP1 levels ultimately limited
this very diversity. Feinerman et al. (2008) concluded that these
findings revealed how eukaryotic cells can draw on regulated variation
in gene expression to achieve phenotypic variability in a controlled
manner.

In a cultured bovine retinal pericyte model, Geraldes et al. (2009)
demonstrated that hyperglycemia persistently activates PRKCD (176977)
and p38-alpha MAPK (MAPK14; 600289), thus increasing expression of SHP1,
and that this occurs independently of NFKB (see 164011) activation. This
signaling cascade leads to PDGF receptor-beta (PDGFRB; 173410)
dephosphorylation and a reduction in downstream signaling from this
receptor, resulting in pericyte apoptosis, the most specific vascular
histopathology associated with diabetic complications. The authors
observed increased PRKCD activity and an increase in the number of
acellular capillaries in diabetic mouse retinas, which were not
reversible with insulin treatment that achieved normoglycemia. Unlike
diabetic age-matched wildtype mice, diabetic Prkcd -/- mice did not show
activation of MAPK14 or SHP1, inhibition of PDGFB (190040) signaling in
vascular cells, or the presence of acellular capillaries. The authors
also observed PRKCD, MAPK14, and SHP1 activation in brain pericytes and
in the renal cortex of diabetic mice. Geraldes et al. (2009) concluded
that this represents a new signaling pathway by which hyperglycemia can
induce PDGFB resistance and increased vascular cell apoptosis to cause
diabetic vascular complications.

Khalil et al. (2012) showed that most proliferating germinal center B
cells do not demonstrate active B cell receptor signaling. Rather,
spontaneous and induced signaling was limited by increased phosphatase
activity. Accordingly, both SHP1 and SH2 domain-containing inositol
5-phosphatase (SHIP1; 601582) were hyperphosphorylated in germinal
center cells and remained colocalized with B cell receptors after
ligation. Furthermore, SHP1 was required for germinal cell maintenance.
Intriguingly, germinal center B cells in the cell cycle G2 period
regained responsiveness to B cell receptor stimulation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Beghini et al. (2000) examined the expression of PTPN6 in CD34+/CD117+
blasts from acute myeloid leukemia patients. They identified and cloned
novel PTPN6 mRNA species, derived from aberrant splicing within the
N-SH2 domain leading to retention of intron 3. Sequence analysis
revealed an A-to-G conversion of A7866, which represents the putative
branch site in IVS3 of PTPN6 mRNA. The level of the aberrant
intron-retaining splice variant, evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR,
was lower in CD117 +/- AML bone marrow mononuclear cells at remission
than at diagnosis, suggesting an involvement of posttranscriptional
PTPN6 processing in leukemogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mice with the recessive 'moth eaten' (me) or the allelic 'viable moth
eaten' mutations express a severe autoimmune and immunodeficiency
syndrome. Tsui et al. (1993) showed that the basic defect involves
lesions in the gene that encodes hematopoietic cell phosphatase. Shultz
et al. (1993) showed that 2 allelic 'motheaten' mutations result in
aberrant splicing of the Hcph transcript. Thus, 'motheaten' was the
first animal model for a specific protein-tyrosine phosphatase
deficiency, useful in determining the precise role of HCPH in
hematopoiesis.

Kamata et al. (2003) found that CD4 T cells in mice heterozygous for the
motheaten mutation express about half the normal amount of SHP1. Th2
cell differentiation and Th2 cytokine production in CD4 T cells and
specific cytokine production in mast cells were enhanced in these mice.
Eosinophilic infiltration and enhanced airway hyperresponsiveness were
also noted in OVA-sensitized heterozygous mice, but only after OVA
inhalation. Kamata et al. (2003) suggested that SHP1 may be a negative
regulator in the development of allergic responses such as allergic
asthma.

Dubois et al. (2006) demonstrated that 'viable motheaten' mice bearing a
functionally deficient SHP1 protein are markedly glucose tolerant and
insulin sensitive compared to wildtype littermates, due to enhanced
insulin receptor signaling to IRS (see 147545)-PI3K (see PIK3CA;
171834)-Akt (164730) in liver and muscle and increased phosphorylation
of CEACAM1 (109770). This metabolic phenotype was recapitulated in
normal mice through adenoviral expression of a dominant-negative
inactive form of SHP1 in the liver or hepatic knockdown of SHP1 by small
hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing. Dubois et al. (2006) concluded that
SHP1 plays a crucial role in negatively modulating insulin action and
clearance in the liver, thereby regulating whole-body glucose
homeostasis.

Using chemical mutagenesis, Croker et al. (2008) obtained mice with a
recessive phenotype they termed 'spin,' for spontaneous inflammation.
Homozygous spin mice had chronic lesions in feet, salivary glands, and
lungs and antichromatin antibodies. Spin mice had enhanced resistance to
Listeria monocytogenes infection. Testing the suppressive effects of
mutations at other loci showed that the autoinflammatory phenotype of
spin mice required Myd88 (602170), Irak4 (606883), and Il1r1 (147810),
but not Ticam1 (607601), Stat1 (600555), or Tnf (191160). Spin mice
derived into a germ-free environment did not show either autoimmune or
autoinflammatory phenotypes. Positional cloning mapped spin to the
distal region of chromosome 6, and Croker et al. (2008) identified a
T-to-A transversion in exon 5 of the Ptpn6 gene, resulting in a
tyr208-to-asn (Y208N) substitution in the N-terminal SH2 domain of the
protein. Croker et al. (2008) concluded that the spin phenotype is due
to a viable hypomorphic allele of Ptpn6 and that spin autoimmunity is
driven by commensal microbes acting through the Tlr (e.g., TLR4; 603030)
pathway requiring Myd88, Irak4, and Il1r1.

PTPN6(spin) mice spontaneously develop a severe inflammatory syndrome
that resembles neutrophilic dermatosis in humans and is characterized by
persistent footpad swelling and suppurative inflammation. Lukens et al.
(2013) reported that receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1;
603453)-regulated interleukin 1-alpha (IL1A; 147760) production by
hematopoietic cells critically mediates chronic inflammatory disease in
Ptpn6(spin) mice, whereas inflammasome signaling and IL1-beta
(147720)-mediated events are dispensable. IL1A was also crucial for
exacerbated inflammatory responses and unremitting tissue damage upon
footpad microabrasion of Ptpn6(spin) mice. Notably, pharmacologic and
genetic blockade of the kinase RIP1 protected against wound-induced
inflammation and tissue damage in Ptpn6(spin) mice, whereas RIP3
(605817) deletion failed to do so. Moreover, RIP1-mediated inflammatory
cytokine production was attenuated by NF-kappa-B (see 164011) and ERK
(see 601795) inhibition. Lukens et al. (2013) concluded that
wound-induced tissue damage and chronic inflammation in Ptpn6(spin) mice
are critically dependent on RIP1-mediated IL1-alpha production, whereas
inflammasome signaling and RIP3-mediated necroptosis are dispensable.

;;RIM3-GAMMA;;
NIM3;;
KIAA0237
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a human immature myeloid cell line
cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned RIMS3, which they designated
KIAA0237. The deduced 308-amino acid protein has a glycosyl hydrolase
motif. Northern blot analysis detected RIMS3 expression in all tissues
examined, with highest expression in brain.

Wang et al. (2000) cloned rat Rims3, which they called Nim3, and
identified human RIMS3 by database analysis. The deduced protein
contains a C2B domain and is highly homologous to the C-terminal parts
of RIMS1 and RIMS2, but it lacks all of the N-terminal domains of RIMS1
and RIMS2. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues detected Rims3
expression in brain only.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2000) found that rat Nim3 enhanced Ca(2+)-dependent
secretion from transfected rat pheochromocytoma cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang and Sudhof (2003) determined that the RIMS3 gene contains 6 exons
and spans 15.4 kb.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the RIMS3
gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis, Wang and Sudhof
(2003) mapped the RIMS3 gene to human chromosome 1p34.1 and to mouse
chromosome 4D2.2.

;;EARLY DEVELOPMENT REGULATOR 2; EDR2;;
POLYHOMEOTIC, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 2;;
HUMAN POLYHOMEOTIC HOMOLOG 2; HPH2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In Drosophila melanogaster, the 'Polycomb' group (PcG) genes are part of
a cellular memory system that is responsible for the stable inheritance
of gene activity. PcG proteins form a large multimeric,
chromatin-associated protein complex. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen,
Gunster et al. (1997) identified leukocyte cDNAs encoding a protein that
interacted with BMI1 (164831), a vertebrate PcG protein. The protein was
designated HPH2 because it had homology to the Drosophila PcG protein
'polyhomeotic' (Ph) as well as to mouse Rae28/Mph1 (see HPH1, 602978).
All 3 proteins contain a zinc finger motif and 2 regions designated
homology domains I and II. The results of 2-hybrid analysis indicated
that homology domains I and II are involved in protein-protein
interactions and may mediate heterodimerization of HPH1 and HPH2. HPH1
and HPH2 coimmunoprecipitate and cofractionate with each other and with
BMI1. By immunofluorescence, Gunster et al. (1997) determined that all 3
proteins colocalize in large domains in interphase nuclei of human
cells. The authors concluded that HPH1, HPH2, and BMI1 are part of a
common, multimeric protein complex. Northern blot analysis revealed that
HPH2 was expressed ubiquitously as a 2.5-kb transcript.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2004) showed that an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which
they designated Polycomb repressive complex-1-like (PRC1L), specifically
monoubiquitinates histone-2A (H2A; see 142711) at lys119. They found
that PRC1L is composed of several PcG proteins, including RING1
(602045), RNF2 (608985), BMI1, and HPH2. Reduction of RNF2 expression
resulted in a dramatic decrease in the level of ubiquitinated H2A in
HeLa cells. Wang et al. (2004) proposed that H2A ubiquitination is
linked to Polycomb silencing.

607051	TITLE *607051 START DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 6; STARD6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cholesterol homeostasis is regulated, at least in part, by sterol
regulatory element (SRE)-binding proteins (e.g., SREBP1; 184756) and by
liver X receptors (e.g., LXRA; 602423). Upon sterol depletion, LXRs are
inactive and SREBPs are cleaved, after which they bind promoter SREs and
activate genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake. Sterol
transport is mediated by vesicles or by soluble protein carriers, such
as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR; 600617). STAR is
homologous to a family of proteins containing a 200- to 210-amino acid
STAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain, including STARD6 (Soccio et
al., 2002).

CLONING

By EST database searching for cDNAs with homology to STARD4 (607048),
Soccio et al. (2002) obtained cDNAs encoding mouse and human STARD6 and
STARD5 (607050). The deduced 220-amino acid STARD6 protein is 26% and
32% identical to STARD4 and STARD5, respectively, and consists entirely
of a START domain. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a
1.5-kb transcript restricted to testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Soccio et al. (2002) determined that the
STARD6 gene contains 6 coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Soccio et al. (2002) mapped that the
STARD6 gene to chromosome 18q21.

112262	TITLE *112262 BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 4; BMP4
;;BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN 2B; BMP2B;;
BMP2B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BMP4 is a vital regulatory molecule that functions throughout
development in mesoderm induction, tooth development, limb formation,
bone induction, and fracture repair. BMP4 is a member of the BMP family
and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180) superfamily of
secretory signaling molecules that play essential roles in embryonic
development (summary by Bakrania et al., 2008).

CLONING

Bakrania et al. (2008) stated that the BMP4 protein is 408 amino acids
long and consists of a TGFB1 propeptide domain and a TGFB domain that
forms an active dimer.

GENE STRUCTURE

The transcriptional unit of the human BMP4 gene is encoded by 5 exons
and spans approximately 7 kb (van den Wijngaard et al., 1996). The human
BMP4 gene has at least 2 functional promoters, which are used in a cell
type-specific manner.

Shore et al. (1998) determined that alternate first exons may be used
and that the first 2 exons are untranslated. The promoter region is
GC-rich and contains no obvious TATA or CAAT consensus sequences. Both
positive and negative transcriptional regulatory elements are contained
within the 5-prime flanking region.

Bakrania et al. (2008) stated that the BMP4 gene contains 4 exons. The
first 2 exons are noncoding.

MAPPING

Dickinson et al. (1990) demonstrated that in the mouse the Bmp2b1 gene
is located on chromosome 14 and maps to the same area as 'pug nose'
(pn). The mutation in that disorder may reside in the Bmp2b1 gene.
Arguing from homology of synteny, Dickinson et al. (1990) suggested that
the human BMP2B1 gene may be located on chromosome 14. Furthermore, they
suggested that a human homolog of the murine Bmp2b2 gene resides on the
X chromosome, as it does in the mouse. There is, however, no direct
evidence of a second BMP2B gene in the human (McAlpine, 1992).

By analysis of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids, Tabas et al. (1993)
assigned the BMP4 gene to human chromosome 14. Using fluorescence in
situ hybridization, van den Wijngaard et al. (1995) localized the BMP4
gene to 14q22-q23. By FISH, Shore et al. (1998) mapped the BMP4 gene to
chromosome 14q21, a region more centromeric than previously reported.

GENE FUNCTION

Shafritz et al. (1996) found overexpression of BMP4 in lymphoblastoid
cell lines from 26 of 32 patients with FOP (135100), but from only 1 of
12 normal subjects (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, BMP4 and its mRNA
were detected in the lymphoblastoid cell lines from a man with FOP and
his 3 affected children, but not from the children's unaffected mother.
Cosegregation of DNA markers for the BMP4 locus on chromosome 14 in the
rare families in which FOP is inherited would strengthen the candidacy
of BMP4, and the demonstration of mutations in the BMP4 gene, especially
in the promoter sequences, would be confirmatory.

In a series of expression studies in mouse, Tucker et al. (1998)
demonstrated that BMP4 activates the expression of Msx1 (142983),
leading to incisor tooth development. BMP4 inhibited expression of Barx1
(603260), which marks presumptive molar teeth, and limits expression to
the proximal, presumptive molar mesenchyme at embryonic day 10.
Fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8; 600483) stimulated Barx1 expression.
When BMP4 signaling in early development was inhibited by application of
exogenous noggin (NOG; 602991) protein, ectopic Barx1 expression
resulted in transformation of tooth identity from incisor to molar.

Dlx1 (600029) and Dlx2 (126255) are involved in the patterning of murine
dentition, since loss of these transcription factors results in early
developmental failure in upper molar teeth. Thomas et al. (2000) found
that Bmp4 was coexpressed with Dlx2 in distal oral epithelium and that
it regulated Dlx2 expression by planar signaling. They presented
evidence that Bmp4 and Fgf8 cooperate and regulate the strict expression
of Dlx2 in the epithelium and the mesenchyme in the first branchial arch
in developing mice.

Dooley et al. (2000) investigated the effect of BMP4 on androgen
production in a human ovarian theca-like tumor (HOTT) cell culture
model. BMP4 decreased forskolin-stimulated HOTT cell secretion of
androstenedione and 17-alphahydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) by 50% but
increased progesterone production 3-fold above forskolin treatment
alone. BMP4 markedly inhibited forskolin stimulation of CYP17 (609300)
expression but had little effect on 3-beta-HSD (see 109715), CYP11A1
(118485), or STAR (600617) protein levels. The authors identified the
presence of mRNA for 3 BMP receptors in the HOTT cells model: BMPR1A
(601299), BMPR1B (603248), and BMPR2 (600799). The authors concluded
that BMP4 inhibits HOTT cell expression of CYP17, leading to an
alteration of the steroidogenic pathway resulting in reduced
androstenedione accumulation and increased progesterone production. They
also noted that the effects of BMP4 seem similar to those caused by
activin (see 147290), another member of the transforming growth
factor-beta (TGFB; see 190180) superfamily of proteins.

In chick embryos, the first signs of left-right asymmetry are detected
in Hensen's node, essentially by left-sided Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725)
expression. After a gap of several hours, Shh induces polarized gene
activities in the left paraxial mesoderm. Monsoro-Burq and Le Douarin
(2001) showed that during this time period, Bmp4 signaling is necessary
and sufficient to maintain Shh asymmetry within the node. Shh and Bmp4
proteins negatively regulate each other's transcription, resulting in a
strict complementarity between these 2 gene patterns on each side of the
node. Noggin, which is present in the midline at this stage, limits Bmp4
spreading. Moreover, Bmp4 is downstream to activin signals and controls
Fgf8. Thus, the authors concluded that early Bmp4 signaling coordinates
left and right pathways in Hensen's node.

Chen et al. (2002) studied BMP4 gene transfer and osteoinduction by BMP4
using an adenoviral vector to transduce mouse myoblast cells. BMP4
expressed by transduced myoblasts was located in the cytoplasm, and the
differentiation pathway utilized by these cells was converted from a
myogenic to an osteogenic pathway. Injection of the adenoviral vector
carrying BMP4 into the hindlimb muscles of male athymic nude rats
resulted in new bone formation that could be visualized on x-ray films
as early as 3 weeks post injection. Histologic staining of bone tissue
revealed a typical remodeled bone structure.

Cheng et al. (2003) measured the ability of 14 human BMPs to induce
osteogenic transformation in a mouse pluripotential stem cell line, a
mouse mesenchymal stem cell line, and a mature human osteoblastic cell
line. Osteogenic activity was determined by measuring induction of
alkaline phosphatase (see 171760), osteocalcin (112260), and matrix
mineralization upon BMP stimulation. All BMPs except BMP3 (112263) and
BMP12 (604651) were able to stimulate alkaline phosphatase activity in
the mature osteoblasts. BMP4 was able to induce all markers of
osteoblast differentiation in pluripotential and mesenchymal stem cells;
however, BMP4 was a weaker inducer than BMP2 (112261), BMP6 (112266),
and BMP9 (GDF2; 605120).

Paez-Pereda et al. (2003) stated that there is little doubt that
estrogens and growth factors are involved in the control of lactotroph
cell proliferation in the pituitary and that the tumorigenic action of
estrogen in prolactinomas had been demonstrated by in vitro and clinical
evidence. Thus, the number of lactotroph cells increases during
pregnancy. Prolactinomas occur more frequently in women and increase in
size during pregnancy or estrogen treatment, and, at least in human
prolactinomas, estrogen receptor expression is positively related to
size. Paez-Pereda et al. (2003) reported a previously undescribed
mechanism for prolactinoma growth that involved BMP4, SMAD4 (600993),
and estrogens.

By in situ hybridization, Zhu et al. (2004) found overlapping expression
of Bmp4 and Nkx2.1 (600635) in embryonic mouse lung. They presented
evidence that Nkx2.1 activated Bmp4 transcription through 2 Nkx2.1
elements in each of the 2 Bmp4 promoters.

Haramis et al. (2004) used mouse models to demonstrate that BMP4
expression occurs exclusively in the intravillus mesenchyme of the
intestine. Villus epithelial cells respond to the BMP signal. Inhibition
of BMP signaling by transgenic expression of noggin results in the
formation of numerous ectopic crypt units perpendicular to the
crypt-villus axis. These changes phenocopy the intestinal histopathology
of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome juvenile polyposis
(174900), including the frequent occurrence of intraepithelial
neoplasia. Many juvenile polyposis cases are known to harbor mutations
in BMP pathway genes. Haramis et al. (2004) concluded that their data
indicated that intestinal BMP signaling represses de novo crypt
formation and polyp growth.

The mouse C3H10T1/2 stem cell line can be induced to differentiate into
adipocytes by exposing proliferating cells to BMP4 during a specific
time window prior to induction of differentiation (Tang et al., 2004).
Bowers et al. (2006) identified a subclone of these cells, the A33 cell
line, that was committed to the adipocyte lineage. A33 cells expressed
and secreted Bmp4 during the critical time point in the proliferative
stage. Inhibition of Bmp4 activity by the addition of noggin at the
critical time blocked the ability of A33 cells to differentiate into
adipocytes.

Piccirillo et al. (2006) reported that bone morphogenetic proteins,
among which BMP4 elicits the strongest effect, trigger a significant
reduction in the stem-like, tumor-initiating precursors of human
glioblastomas. Transient in vitro exposure to BMP4 abolished the
capacity of transplanted glioblastoma cells to establish intracerebral
glioblastomas. Most importantly, in vivo delivery of BMP4 effectively
blocked the tumor growth and associated mortality that occurred in 100%
of mice after intracerebral grafting of human glioblastoma cells.
Piccirillo et al. (2006) demonstrated that BMPs activate their cognate
receptor BMPRs and trigger the SMAD signaling cascade in cells isolated
from human glioblastomas. This is followed by a reduction in
proliferation, and increased expression of markers of neural
differentiation, with no effect on cell viability. The concomitant
reduction in clonogenic ability, in the size of the CD133
(604365)-positive population, and in the growth kinetics of glioblastoma
cells indicated that BMP4 reduces the tumor-initiating cell pool of
glioblastomas. These findings showed that the BMP-BMPR signaling
system--which controls the activity of normal brainstem cells--may also
act as a key inhibitory regulator of tumor-initiating, stem-like cells
from glioblastomas and the results also identified BMP4 as a novel,
noncytotoxic therapeutic effector, which may be used to prevent growth
and recurrence of glioblastomas in humans.

Wordinger et al. (2007) studied the effects of altered BMP signaling on
intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG; see
137760). They found that the human trabecular meshwork (TM) synthesized
and secreted BMP4 as well as expressed the BMP receptor subtypes BMPR1
(see BMPR1A; 601299) and BMPR2 (600799). TM cells responded to exogenous
BMP4 by phosphorylating SMAD signaling proteins. Cultured human TM cells
treated with TGFB2 significantly increased fibronectin (FN; 135600)
levels, and BMP4 blocked this FN induction. There was significant
elevation of mRNA and protein levels of the BMP antagonist Gremlin
(GREM1; 603054) in glaucomatous TM cells. In addition, Gremlin was
present in human aqueous humor. Gremlin blocked the negative effect of
BMP4 on TGFB2 induction of FN. Addition of recombinant Gremlin to the
medium of ex vivo perfusion-cultured human eye anterior segments caused
the glaucoma phenotype of elevated IOP. Wordinger et al. (2007)
concluded that these results were consistent with the hypothesis that,
in POAG, elevated expression of Gremlin by TM cells inhibited BMP4
antagonism of TGFB2 and led to increased extracellular matrix deposition
and elevated IOP.

Using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analyses, Cejalvo
et al. (2007) demonstrated that human thymus and cortical epithelial
cells produced BMP2 and BMP4 and that both thymocytes and thymic
epithelium expressed the molecular machinery to respond to these
proteins. The receptors BMPR1A and BMPR2 were mainly expressed by
cortical thymocytes, whereas BMPR1B was expressed in the majority of
thymocytes. BMP4 treatment of chimeric human-mouse fetal thymic organ
cultures seeded with CD34 (142230)-positive human thymic progenitors
resulted in reduced cell recovery and inhibition of differentiation of
CD4 (186940)/CD8 (see 186910) double-negative to double-positive stages.
Cejalvo et al. (2007) concluded that BMP2 and BMP4 have a role in human
T-cell differentiation.

A hair follicle cycles through anagen (growth), catagen (involution),
and telogen (resting) phases and then reenters the anagen phase. Plikus
et al. (2008) demonstrated that unexpected periodic expression of BMP2
and BMP4 in the dermis regulates the process of hair follicle
regeneration. This BMP cycle is out of phase with the WNT/beta catenin
cycle (see 116806), thus dividing the conventional telogen into new
functional phases: one refractory and the other competent for hair
regeneration, characterized by high and low BMP signaling, respectively.
Overexpression of noggin (602991), a BMP antagonist, in mouse skin
resulted in a markedly shortened refractory phase and faster propagation
of the regenerative wave. Transplantation of skin from this mutant onto
a wildtype host showed that follicles and donor and host can affect
their cycling behaviors mutually, with the outcome depending on the
equilibrium of BMP activity in the dermis. Administration of BMP4
protein caused the competent region to become refractory. The existence
of a substance termed 'chalone' had been proposed to explain the
phenomenon of telogen refractivity, which can inhibit anagen
development. Plikus et al. (2008) suggested that BMPs may be the
long-sought chalone postulated by classical experiments. Plikus et al.
(2008) concluded that, taken together, the results presented in this
study provided an example of hierarchical regulation of local organ stem
cell homeostasis by the interorgan macroenvironment. The expression of
Bmp2 in subcutaneous adipocytes indicates physiologic integration
between the 2 thermoregulatory organs.

Using in situ hybridization in human embryos, Bakrania et al. (2008)
authors demonstrated expression of BMP4 in optic vesicle, developing
lens, the diencephalic floor, consistent with a role in pituitary
development, and in the interdigital mesenchyme and the joint primordium
at the stage at which limb buds have formed and are starting to
differentiate into fingers. Because BMP4 interacts with hedgehog
signaling genes in animals, Bakrania et al. (2008) evaluated gene
expression in embryos and demonstrated cotemporal and cospatial
expression of BMP4 and hedgehog signaling genes.

Wang et al. (2008) demonstrated binding between human full-length
triple-helical type IV collagen (see 120130) and BMP4. Based on
experiments in Drosophila, Wang et al. (2008) predicted that a conserved
sequence in type IV collagen functions as a BMP-binding module, and that
type IV collagens affect BMP signaling during vertebrate development.

Limb development is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loops
between sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
signaling involving the bone morphogenetic protein antagonist Grem1. By
combining mouse molecular genetics with mathematical modeling, Benazet
et al. (2009) showed that BMP4 first initiates and SHH then propagates
epithelial-mesenchymal feedback signaling through differential
transcriptional regulation of Grem1 to control digit specification. This
switch occurs by linking a fast BMP4/GREM1 module to the slower
SHH/GREM1/FGF epithelial-mesenchymal feedback loop. This self-regulatory
signaling network results in robust regulation of distal limb
development that is able to compensate for variations by
interconnectivity among the 3 signaling pathways.

Wandzioch and Zaret (2009) investigated how BMP4, transforming growth
factor-beta (TGF-beta; 190180), and fibroblast growth factor signaling
pathways converge on the earliest genes that elicit pancreas and liver
induction in mouse embryos. These genes include ALB1 (103600), PROX1
(601546), HNF6 (604164), HNF1B (189907), and PDX1 (600733). The
inductive network was found to be dynamic; it changed within hours.
Different signals functioned in parallel to induce different early
genes, and 2 permutations of signals induced liver progenitor domains,
which revealed flexibility in cell programming. Also, the specification
of pancreas and liver progenitors was restricted by the TGF-beta
pathway.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bakrania et al. (2008) considered BMP4 as a candidate gene for ocular
malformation and digit anomalies (MCOPS6; 607932) and screened 215
individuals with ocular defects, mainly microphthalmia, for cytogenetic
defects by chromosomal analysis, for gene deletions by multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and for mutations in the
BMP4 gene by direct sequencing. They identified 2 individuals with a
14q22-q23 deletion associated with anophthalmia-microphthalmia, 1 with
associated pituitary anomaly. Sequence analysis of the BMP4 gene
identified 2 mutations: a frameshift mutation (112262.0001) in a family
with anophthalmia-microphthalmia, retinal dystrophy, myopia, poly-
and/or syndactyly, and brain anomalies, and a missense mutation
(112262.0002) in an individual with anophthalmia-microphthalmia and
brain anomalies. The finding of expression of BMP4 in developing human
optic vesicle, retina and lens, pituitary region, and digits strongly
supported BMP4 as a causative gene for anophthalmia-microphthalmia with
pituitary abnormalities and digit anomalies. Bakrania et al. (2008) also
identified 4 cases, some of which had retinal dystrophy, with 'low
penetrant' mutations in both BMP4 and hedgehog signaling genes, namely,
Sonic hedgehog (SHH; 600725) or Patched (PTCH1; 601309). Bakrania et al.
(2008) concluded that BMP4 is a major gene for
anophthalmia-microphthalmia and/or retinal dystrophy and brain anomalies
and may be a candidate for myopia and poly/syndactyly. The finding of
low-penetrant variants of BMP4 and hedgehog signaling partners suggested
an interaction between the 2 pathways in humans.

Suzuki et al. (2009) identified mutations in the BMP4 gene (see, e.g.,
112262.0003-112262.0005 and 112262.0007) in patients with cleft lip and
cleft palate (OFC11; 600625). The parents, who also carried the
mutation, had subtle defects in the orbicularis oris muscle on
ultrasound. Overall, BMP4 mutations were identified in 1 of 30 patients
with microform clefts, 2 of 87 patients with subepithelial defects in
the orbicularis oris muscle, and 5 of 968 patients with overt cleft
lip/palate (CL/P). These results indicated that microforms and
subepithelial defects in the orbicularis oris muscle are part of the
spectrum of CL/P and should be considered during the clinical evaluation
of families with clefts.

Reis et al. (2011) analyzed the BMP4 coding region in 133 patients with
various ocular conditions, including 60 with clinical
anophthalmia/microphthalmia (34 syndromic), 38 with anterior segment
anomalies (including 3 patients with SHORT syndrome, 269880), 16 with
cataract, 4 with coloboma, 5 with high myopia, and 10 with other
disorders. In 1 patient with SHORT syndrome, they identified a
heterozygous 2.263-Mb deletion encompassing BMP4 and 13 other genes. In
3 probands with syndromic microphthalmia, they identified heterozygosity
for a 158-kb deletion involving only the BMP4 gene (112262.0006), a
nonsense mutation (R198X; 122262.0007), and a frameshift mutation
(112262.0008), respectively; the affected sister of the proband with the
frameshift mutation carried both the frameshift and a missense mutation
(H121R; 112262.0009).

ANIMAL MODEL

Connor (1996) speculated that transgenic mice with selective
overexpression of Bmp4 may serve as animal models of fibrodysplasia
ossificans progressiva (FOP; 135100) and may make it possible to
evaluate potential therapies directed at influencing the expression of
BMP4 or its 2 types of cell-surface receptors. Not only may this
knowledge provide a rational basis for therapy for FOP, but possibly
also measures for the control of local ectopic bone development, which
occurs in 10 to 20% of patients who have undergone surgical hip
replacement. According to Connor (1996), there appears to be an
individual propensity to the phenomenon of secondary ectopic
ossification of soft tissue. In the 10 to 20% of patients who develop
local ectopic bone formation after hip replacement, if surgical removal
of that bone is attempted or the opposite hip is replaced, ectopic bone
almost invariably recurs or occurs.

Furuta and Hogan, (1998) showed that Bmp4, which is expressed strongly
in the mouse optic vesicle and weakly in surrounding mesenchyme and
surface ectoderm, plays a crucial role in lens induction. In Bmp4-null
mouse embryos, lens induction was absent but could be rescued by
exogenous BMP4 protein applied into the optic vesicle in explant
cultures. In Bmp4-null embryos, Msx2 (123101) expression was absent, and
expression mutant eye explants was rescued by BMP4-carrying beads,
suggesting that BMP4 functions to regulate specific gene expression in
the optic vesicle. No change in Pax6 (607108) was detected in Bmp4-null
eyes.

Using a hypomorphic Bmp4 allele and conditional gene inactivation, Jiao
et al. (2003) circumvented the early lethality of Bmp4 null mouse
embryos and manipulated Bmp4 expression specifically in developing
cardiomyocytes. They found that Bmp4 was dispensable for cushion
formation but was required for proper atrioventricular septation after
cushions had formed. Defects in septation caused atrioventricular canal
defects (AVCD; 600309) that recapitulated the range of AVCDs diagnosed
in patients.

Kan et al. (2004) generated mice overexpressing BMP4 under the control
of the neuron-specific enolase promoter (ENO2; 131360) and observed the
development of progressive postnatal heterotopic endochondral
ossification, a phenotype that matches the anatomic, spatial, and
temporal characteristics of human FOP. The phenotype was completely
rescued in double-transgenic mice that also overexpressed the BMP4
inhibitor noggin, confirming the role of BMP4 in the pathogenesis of the
disease.

Liu et al. (2005) demonstrated that mice with conditional inactivation
of the Bmpr1a gene in the facial primordia developed completely
penetrant, bilateral cleft lip/palate (119530) with arrested tooth
formation. The cleft secondary palate of Bmpr1a-mutant embryos was
associated with diminished cell proliferation in maxillary process
mesenchyme and defective anterior posterior patterning. In contrast, the
mutant mice showed elevated apoptosis in the fusing lip region of the
medial nasal process. Conditional inactivation of the Bmp4 gene resulted
in delayed fusion of the medial nasal process to form the lip, resulting
in isolated cleft lip in all mouse embryos at 12 days after conception.
However, cleft lip was only present in 22% of mouse embryos at 14.5 days
after conception, indicating spontaneous repair of cleft lip in utero
(see 600625). The findings implicated a BMP4-BMPR1A genetic pathway that
functions in lip fusion, and revealed that BMP signaling has distinct
roles in lip and palate fusion.

Fuller et al. (2007) found that Bmp4 and Bmp7 (112267) increased rapidly
at the site of chemically-induced demyelinating lesions in adult rat
spinal cord. The Bmp proteins stimulated Smad (see, e.g., SMAD1; 601595)
activation in mature astrocytes, resulting in increased expression of
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and glial scar formation.

Goldman et al. (2009) used Bmp4-hypomorphic mice to investigate the
regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and the maintenance
of steady-state hematopoiesis in adults. Reporter gene analysis showed
that Bmp4 was expressed in osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and
megakaryocytes. Resting hematopoiesis was normal in Bmp4-deficient mice,
but cells expressing Kit (164920) and Sca1 (also known as Ly6a, a
mouse-specific gene) were significantly reduced. Serial transplantation
revealed that Bmp4-deficient recipients had a microenvironmental defect
that reduced the repopulating activity of wildtype HSCs. When wildtype
HSCs did engraft in Bmp4-deficient bone marrow, they showed a marked
decrease in functional stem cell activity. Goldman et al. (2009)
concluded that BMP4 is a critical component of the hematopoietic
microenvironment and is involved in regulating HSC number and function.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, 2-BP DEL, 226AG

Bakrania et al. (2008) described a kindred in which members of 3
generations had eye, brain, and digit developmental anomalies (MCOPS6;
607932) related to a frameshift mutation in the BMP4 gene (222del2AG,
S76fs104X). The proband had clinical anophthalmia with no light
perception on the right; the left eye showed microcornea, coloboma,
retinal dystrophy, and tilted optic disc. He had mild learning
difficulties and polydactyly. Cranial MRI showed enlarged trigones,
hypoplastic corpus callosum, and sulcal widening. The maternal
grandmother, who carried the same mutation, showed on MRI enlarged
ventricles, hypoplastic corpus callosum, and marked sulcal widening
associated with diffuse brain atrophy; additionally, she had polydactyly
and finger webbing.

.0002
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, GLU93GLY

In a patient with eye, brain, and digit developmental anomalies (MCOPS6;
607932), Bakrania et al. (2008) identified a 278A-G transition in the
BMP4 gene that resulted in a glu93-to-gly substitution (E93G). The right
eye of the patient showed microphthalmia, sclerocornea, and orbital
cyst; the left eye showed microphthalmia, coloboma, and microcornea.
Cranial MRI showed delayed myelination and mild reduction in white
matter. The proband had developmental delay, seizures, undescended
testes, simple prominent ears, broad hands, low-placed thumbs, and
dysplastic nails.

.0003
OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
BMP4, ALA346VAL

In a child with a microform cleft lip and cleft palate (OFC11; 600625),
Suzuki et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 1037C-T transition in the
BMP4 gene, resulting in an ala346-to-val (A346V) substitution. His
father, who also carried the mutation, had subtle right microform cleft
lip and a bifid uvula. The microform cleft lip was confirmed by
ultrasound, which detected defects in the orbicularis oris muscle in
both patients.

.0004
OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
BMP4, SER91CYS

In a child with a cleft lip and cleft palate (OFC11; 600625), Suzuki et
al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 271A-T transversion in the BMP4
gene, resulting in a ser91-to-cys (S91C) substitution. The child's
parent, who also carried the mutation, had defects of the orbicularis
oris muscle on ultrasonography.

.0005
OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
BMP4, ARG287HIS

In a child with a cleft lip and cleft palate (OFC11; 600625), Suzuki et
al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 860G-A transition in the BMP4 gene,
resulting in an arg287-to-his (R287H) substitution. The child's parent,
who also carried the mutation, had defects of the orbicularis oris
muscle on ultrasonography.

.0006
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, DEL

In a 12-year-old Caucasian girl with bilateral microphthalmia and other
eye anomalies, facial dysmorphism, cognitive impairment, and a history
of hypotonia (MCOPS6; 607932), Reis et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for a 158-kb deletion on chromosome 14q22.2, with a
minimum interval chr14:53,361,728-53,520,165 and a maximum interval
chr14:53,352,059-53,520,859 (NCBI36), deleting only the BMP4 gene. In
addition to bilateral microphthalmia, the patient had bilateral
persistence of the pupillary membrane, high myopia, strabismus, and
nystagmus. Her dysmorphic facial features included maxillary hypoplasia
with midface flattening, thin upper lip, broad nasal bridge and tip, and
telecanthus, with a preauricular ear tag on the right. She had normal
growth, head circumference, umbilicus, hands, and feet. The patient was
adopted, and no family members were available for study.

.0007
OROFACIAL CLEFT 11
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6, INCLUDED
BMP4, ARG198TER

In a Mongolian patient with cleft lip and palate (OFC11; 600625), Suzuki
et al. (2009) identified heterozygosity for a 592C-T transition in exon
4 of the BMP4 gene, resulting in an arg198-to-ter (R198X) substitution.
The parents were unavailable for testing.

In a 19-month-old boy with right clinical anophthalmia and left
microphthalmia, sclerocornea, facial asymmetry, and right-sided
diaphragmatic hernia (MCOPS6; 607932), Reis et al. (2011) identified
heterozygosity for the R198X mutation in BMP4. The boy also had mild to
moderate laryngomalacia, with indentation from the innominate artery,
and bilateral inguinal hernias. He was macrocephalic with a large
anterior fontanel, and had hydrocephalus that was treated with a large
subdural-peritoneal shunt. Brain MRI at 4 months of age confirmed the
ocular findings and showed macrocrania with very prominent subarachnoid
spaces, superimposed overlying subdural collections, as well as diffuse
cerebral atrophy with ventricular prominence. The mutation was not found
in 179 Caucasian, 89 African American, 91 Asian, and 93 Hispanic
controls.

.0008
MICROPHTHALMIA, SYNDROMIC 6
BMP4, 1-BP DUP, 171C

In a 3.5-year-old Caucasian girl with bilateral clinical anophthalmia,
small ears, and small left renal cyst (MCOPS6; 607932), Reis et al.
(2011) identified heterozygosity for a 1-bp duplication (171dupC) in
exon 2 of the BMP4 gene, predicted to cause a frameshift and premature
termination. The proband had normal development, without craniofacial
dysmorphism or anomalies of the hands or feet. Head CT in the neonatal
period showed significantly small globes, minimal ocular tissue, and
absent optic nerves, but otherwise normal brain structures. Her affected
9-year-old maternal half sister was found to be compound heterozygous
for 171dupC and a 362A-G transition in exon 2 of BMP4, resulting in a
his121-to-arg (H121R; 112262.0009) substitution at a conserved residue.
The sister had unilateral clinical anophthalmia, blepharophimosis,
telecanthus, and bilateral postaxial polydactyly of the hands. She had
poor growth, with height and weight less than the third centile, and
relative macrocephaly with frontal bossing. Head CT showed atrophic left
globe and small left orbit. Their asymptomatic mother was heterozygous
for the frameshift mutation, with no evidence of mosaicism; the mutation
was apparently de novo, as the maternal grandparents carried wildtype
BMP4 alleles. The mother was unavailable for examination, so mild ocular
anomalies could not be ruled out, and the father was also unavailable
for study. Neither mutation was found in 179 Caucasian, 89 African
American, 91 Asian, and 93 Hispanic controls.

150150	TITLE *150150 LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE C; LDHC
;;LDH, TESTICULAR FORM; LDHX
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zinkham et al. (1964) found a distinctive LDH isozyme in mature testes
of many species including man. It is polymorphic in the pigeon, and one
can infer that a locus separate from LDHA (150000) and LDHB (150100)
controls it. The same is almost certainly true in the human. This is a
gene that functions only in one sex and only in one tissue.

Sakai et al. (1987) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones of LDHC from the
mouse. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)-containing RNAs from mouse
testes and liver indicated that the Ldhc gene was expressed in testes
but not in liver. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of mouse Ldhc
showed 73 and 72% homology, respectively, with those of mouse Ldha.
Southern blot analysis of genomic DNAs from mouse liver and human
placenta indicated the presence of multiple LDH-C gene-related
sequences. From the amino acid sequence deduced from cDNA, Millan et al.
(1987) found that human LDHC is as different from rodent Ldhc (73%
homology) as it is from human LDHA (76% homology) and porcine LDHB (68%
homology).

MAPPING

Zinkham et al. (1969) found that the LDHB and LDHC loci are closely
linked in pigeons. Edwards et al. (1987) used an LDHC cDNA to analyze
genomic DNA from rodent/human somatic cell hybrids. These showed that
LDHA and LDHC are syntenic on human chromosome 11. The assignment of
LDHC was confirmed by Kao et al. (1988), who localized the gene to
11p15.5-p14.3 by use of somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosome
hybridization. Li et al. (1988) also assigned LDHC to chromosome 11 by
hybridization of DNA from flow-sorted chromosomes. The close physical
proximity of the LDHC and LDHA genes supports the evolutionary
relatedness of the 2 isozymes. Edwards et al. (1989) reported mapping of
LDHC to 11p15.5-p15.3 by combination of somatic cell hybrid studies and
in situ hybridization.

605344	TITLE *605344 NUCLEAR TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR Y, GAMMA; NFYC
;;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NF-Y, C SUBUNIT;;
CCAAT-BINDING FACTOR, C SUBUNIT; CBFC
DESCRIPTION The CCAAT box is a widespread element found in promoters and enhancers.
Nuclear factor Y (NFY), also termed CCAAT-binding factor (CBF), is a
ubiquitous heterotrimeric protein containing NFYA (189903), NFYB
(189904), and NFYC. NFYB and NFYC must interact and dimerize for NFYA
association and DNA binding, most notably to Y-box elements such as
CCAAT in major histocompatibility (MHC) class II promoters (see MHC2TA;
600005), to occur.

Using the rat Nfyc sequence and PCR to screen HeLa cell cDNA libraries,
Nakshatri et al. (1996) and Bellorini et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs
encoding NFYC. By differential hybridization of a gridded fetal brain
cDNA library, Dmitrenko et al. (1997) also cloned the NFYC gene, which
they termed CBFC. Sequence analysis predicted that the 335-amino acid
NFYC protein, which is approximately 97% identical to the rodent Nfyc
sequences, contains a yeast Hap5 homology region (approximately 75%
identity with the corresponding region in Hap5) and a glutamine-rich
region. Northern blot analysis detected a major 2.3- and a minor 1.5-kb
NFYC transcript in all tissues tested, with higher amounts of both mRNAs
in testis (Bellorini et al., 1997).

GENE STRUCTURE

Chang et al. (2008) showed that the NFYC gene has 10 exons and that the
microRNAs MIRN30E and MIRN30C1 are contained within intron 5.

MAPPING

By interspecific backcross and segregation analysis, Sinha et al. (1996)
mapped the mouse Nfyc gene to chromosome 4 in a region showing homology
of synteny to human 1p32. Scott (2000) mapped the NFYC gene to
1p34.2-p33 based on sequence similarity between the NFYC sequence
(GenBank GENBANK D89986) and the chromosome 1 clone RP5-1066H13 (GenBank
GENBANK AL158843).

180475	TITLE *180475 RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L12; RPL12
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Biogenesis of the mammalian ribosome, the site of protein synthesis,
involves coordinated expression of 4 ribosomal RNA molecules and
approximately 75 ribosomal proteins. Chu et al. (1993) isolated a cDNA
clone encoding human ribosomal protein L12 from a dermal microvascular
endothelial cell cDNA library. The protein contains 165 amino acids and
exhibits 99.4% sequence identity with rat ribosomal protein L12.
Northern blot analysis detected an mRNA transcript of 800 bases.

Cuccurese et al. (2005) identified an RPL12 splice variant in a human
lung carcinoma cell line that was induced following inhibition of
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The variant retains part of intron 1,
resulting in a premature termination codon. Northern blot analysis
showed that the variant is 0.8 kb, while the major species is 0.63 kb.
Intron 1 is highly conserved in human, mouse, and bovine RPL12 genes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the RPL12 gene to chromosome 9q33.3 based on an
alignment of the RPL12 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB209471) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

603300	TITLE *603300 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA-INDUCED PROTEIN 2; TNFAIP2
;;EXOCYST COMPLEX COMPONENT 3-LIKE 3; EXOC3L3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

TNF (191160) is a proinflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic effects on
cells and tissues, mediated mostly by alterations in target tissue gene
expression. Using differential hybridization to identify primary
response genes induced by TNF in human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs), Sarma et al. (1992) isolated a HUVEC cDNA encoding TNFAIP2.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4.2-kb human TNFAIP2 transcript.
During mouse development, expression of the Tnfaip2 transcript varied in
a temporal fashion that was organ-specific. The TNFAIP2 cDNA encodes a
predicted 654-amino acid protein with a single N-linked glycosylation
site; stretches of glutamates, lysines, and alanines near the N
terminus; and 4 glutamines near the C terminus. Immunoprecipitation
studies confirmed the calculated molecular mass of 73 kD. Sarma et al.
(1992) used Southern blot analysis to show that TNFAIP2 is an
evolutionarily conserved single-copy gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Sarma et al. (1992) found that the TNFAIP2 gene was induced in HUVECs in
response to the proinflammatory molecules TNF, IL1B (147720), and
lipopolysaccharide. TNFAIP2 demonstrated the characteristics of a
primary response gene in its rapid and substantial induction in the
absence of intermediary protein synthesis. The authors found that
TNFAIP2 transcription was induced during capillary tube formation in
vitro.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization,
Sarma et al. (1992) localized the TNFAIP2 gene to chromosome 14q32.

;;YME1L;;
YME1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, 1;;
PRESENILIN-ASSOCIATED METALLOPROTEASE; PAMP
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

YME1L1 shares significant homology with 3 members of the AAA superfamily
of metalloproteases from S. cerevisiae, Afg3 (see 603020), Rca1, and
Yme1. In yeast, these proteins are localized to the mitochondrial inner
membrane, where they perform roles in the assembly and turnover of
respiratory chain complexes.

CLONING

Using database analysis, conventional screening, and 5-prime RACE,
Coppola et al. (2000) cloned YME1L1 from a fetal brain cDNA library. The
deduced 716-amino acid protein contains an AAA consensus sequence, an
ATP/GTP-binding motif, and a zinc-dependent binding domain. YME1L1
shares 50% sequence identity with yeast Yme1, 40% identity with yeast
Rca1, and 39% identity with yeast Afg3, with highest homology in the
central regions of the proteins. Northern blot analysis revealed
transcripts of about 2.6 and 4.4 kb in all tissues examined, with
greatest abundance in adult heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. The
shorter transcript likely results from the use of an alternate
polyadenylation site. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos revealed
ubiquitous expression. YME1L1 overexpressed in COS-7 cells showed a
granular cytoplasmic localization, with higher density of puncta around
the nucleus, and colocalization with a mitochondrial marker.

Using the C termini of presenilin-1 (PSEN1; 104311) and presenilin-2
(PSEN2; 600759) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA
library, followed by screening a liver cDNA library, Pellegrini et al.
(2001) cloned YME1L1, which they designated PAMP. Northern blot analysis
detected 2 PAMP transcripts with different 3-prime untranslated regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast strain in which the Yme1 gene was disrupted, Shah et al.
(2000) found that transfection and expression of YME1L1 restored growth
under conditions that were lethal to the Yme1-disrupted cells. Shah et
al. (2000) concluded that YME1L1 plays a phylogenetically conserved role
in mitochondrial protein metabolism.

GENE STRUCTURE

Coppola et al. (2000) determined that the YME1L1 gene contains 19 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Coppola et al. (2000) mapped the YME1L1
gene to chromosome 10q14. However, Gross (2008) mapped the YME1L1 gene
to chromosome 10p12.1 based on an alignment of the YME1L1 sequence
(GenBank GENBANK AJ132637) with the genomic sequence (build 36.3).

DESCRIPTION The multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first
enzyme complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. See
NDUFA2 (602137). By a combination of EST database searching and PCR,
Loeffen et al. (1998) isolated human cDNAs encoding NDUFC2 and 7 other

602074	TITLE *602074 DEATH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; DAP3
;;MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S29; MRPS29
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kissil et al. (1995) cloned DAP3. DAP3 is transcribed into a 1.7-kb mRNA
and encodes a 46-kD protein carrying a potential nucleotide-binding
motif.

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human DAP3, which they called MRPS29. The deduced 397-amino
acid MRPS29 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 45.6 kD. Removal
of a predicted 16-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization
signal results in a mature 43.6-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS29 orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast, but not in
E. coli. Mouse and human MRPS29 share 81.8% amino acid identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Kissil et al. (1995) found that DAP3 was involved in mediating
interferon-gamma (147570)-induced cell death. Several lines of evidence
suggested that suppression of cell death is a critical step in the
multistage process of tumorigenesis. Kissil et al. (1995) concluded that
DAP3, being a positive mediator of cell death, may be a tumor suppressor
gene subject to loss or inactivation in tumors.

MAPPING

Kissil and Kimchi (1997) mapped the DAP3 gene to chromosome 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Verification of the assignment was
achieved by identifying the gene in a YAC contig encompassing chromosome
1q21.1-q21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hirota et al. (2004) found a strong association between bronchial asthma
(600807) in adults and SNPs in the DAP3 gene (p = 0.0051; OR = 1.87; 95%
CI = 1.20-2.92), but no association with childhood asthma. The tendency
was more prominent in patients with high serum total immunoglobulin E
(IgE; 147180). DAP3 was found to be expressed in normal bronchial
epithelial cells, and that expression was induced by IFNG.

604602	TITLE *604602 RIBOSOME-RECYCLING FACTOR, MITOCHONDRIAL; MRRF
;;RRF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The termination of protein synthesis requires the action of several
auxiliary factors. In bacteria, ribosome-recycling factor (Rrf) is
essential for the release of ribosomes from the mRNA at the stop codon.
Mitochondria perform protein synthesis using a translation system that
has some features reminiscent of prokaryotic translation and other
features that are unique. By searching an EST database using the E. coli
Rrf protein sequence as the query, Zhang and Spremulli (1998) identified
human ESTs encoding mitochondrial ribosome-recycling factor (MRRF). They
assembled the complete MRRF coding sequence using ESTs. Sequence
analysis of the deduced 263-amino acid MRRF protein indicated that it is
likely localized in the mitochondria; however, MRRF does not have a
clear cleavage signal for removal of the signal peptide. Human MRRF
shares approximately 25 to 30% amino acid sequence identity with
bacterial RRFs.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro assays with recombinant human proteins, Tsuboi et al.
(2009) showed that RRF interacted directly with EFG2 (GFM2; 606544) and
that both were required for ribosome dissociation from mRNA. GTP, but
not GTP hydrolysis, was also required. GTP hydrolysis by EFG2 appeared
to follow the ribosome splitting reaction and occurred on the ribosomal
large subunit. EFG2 and RRF remained on the large subunit until GTP was
hydrolyzed and prevented reassociation of subunits.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Hansen et al. (2000) assigned the MRRF
gene to chromosome 9q32-q34.1.

602123	TITLE *602123 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE II-GAMMA; CAMK2G
;;CaM KINASE II GAMMA SUBUNIT;;
CAMKG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is a
ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in
diverse effects of hormones and neurotransmitters that utilize Ca(2+) as
a second messenger. The enzyme is an oligomeric protein composed of
distinct but related subunits, alpha (114078), beta (607707), gamma, and
delta (607708), each encoded by a separate gene. Each subunit has
alternatively spliced variants.

CLONING

Breen and Ashcroft (1997) cloned and sequenced a novel CaM kinase
II-gamma cDNA from human islet cell RNA. This isoform, designated
gamma-SRP by the authors, encodes a truncated gamma CaM kinase II in
which the 3-prime end consists of 804 basepairs of the human SRP72 gene
(602122).

Tombes and Krystal (1997) identified a number of CAMKG variants
expressed by neuronal cells. Two variants were consistently expressed in
nonneuronal cell lines, and another was preferentially expressed in
tumor cells.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Li et al. (1994) mapped the CAMK2G gene to human
chromosome 10q22. Ahmed et al. (2001) stated that CAMK2G is 1 of 3 genes
that are nested in the introns of PCDH15 (605514).

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse cardiomyocytes, Zhu et al. (2003) demonstrated that
beta-1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1; 109630)-induced apoptosis was
resistant to inhibition of PKA (see 176911). Rather, the Adrb1
proapoptotic effect was associated with non-Pka-dependent increases in
intracellular Ca(2+) and Camk2 activity. Blocking the L-type Ca(2+)
channel (see 114205), buffering intracellular Ca(2+), or inhibiting
Camk2 activity fully protected cardiomyocytes against Adrb1-induced
apoptosis; overexpressing the c splice variant of Camk2d markedly
exaggerated the Adrb1 apoptotic effect. Zhu et al. (2003) concluded that
CAMK2 constitutes a PKA-independent linkage of ADRB1 stimulation to
cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Among 304 Swiss individuals tested and genotyped, de Quervain and
Papassotiropoulos (2006) found a significant association (p = 0.00008)
between short-term episodic memory performance and genetic variations in
a 7-gene cluster consisting of the ADCY8 (103070), PRKACG (176893),
CAMK2G, GRIN2A (138253), GRIN2B (138252), GRM3 (601115), and PRKCA
(176960) genes, all of which have well-established molecular and
biologic functions in animal memory. Functional MRI studies in an
independent set of 32 individuals with similar memory performance showed
a correlation between activation in memory-related brain regions,
including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and genetic
variability in the 7-gene cluster. De Quervain and Papassotiropoulos
(2006) concluded that these 7 genes encode proteins of the memory
formation signaling cascade that are important for human memory
function.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of mutation in the CAMK2G gene as a possible cause of an
intellectual disability phenotype, see 602123.0001.

ANIMAL MODEL

To study the role of CaMKII in T cells, Bui et al. (2000) generated
transgenic mice expressing a partially calcium-independent mutant form
of CAMKG (thr287 to asp). The size of the thymus was increased 1.5- to
2-fold in these mice, at least in part due to an increase in the life
span of double-positive thymocytes. There was an increase in the number
of T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs that had acquired an
antigen-dependent memory phenotype. These T cells were bona fide memory
cells as assessed by a variety of criteria. In addition, T cells from
wildtype mice acquired calcium-independent CaMKII activity after several
rounds of antigen-stimulated division. The authors proposed that CaMKII
controls a distinct process of activation-induced cellular
differentiation.

Using gene targeting, Zhang et al. (2005) developed a mouse model of
cardiac Camk2 inhibition and demonstrated substantial prevention of
maladaptive remodeling from excessive beta-adrenergic receptor
stimulation and myocardial infarction, and induction of balanced changes
in excitation-contraction coupling that preserved baseline and
beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated physiologic increases in cardiac
function. Zhang et al. (2005) concluded that CAMK2 is a determinant of
clinically important heart disease phenotypes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CAMK2G, ARG292PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to intellectual disability has not been confirmed.

In a boy with severe intellectual disability with self mutilation,
myopia, strabismus, mitochondrial dysfunction without mitochondrial gene
defects, short stature, flat face with narrow forehead, long palpebral
fissures, arched eyebrows, sacral dimple, short hands, brachydactyly,
and short feet, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous
875G-C transversion resulting in an arg29-to-pro (R29P) substitution.
The patient had normal array and MLL2 testing.

600875	TITLE *600875 ACYLPHOSPHATASE, ERYTHROCYTE; ACYP1
;;ACYPE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Acylphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.7) is a small cytosolic enzyme with a
molecular mass of 11 kD that is expressed in many vertebrate tissues.
The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the carboxyl-phosphate bond of
acyl phosphates. Two isoenzymes have been isolated, called muscle
acylphosphatase (102595) and erythrocyte acylphosphatase on the basis of
their tissue localization (summary by Fiaschi et al., 1995).

CLONING

Liguri et al. (1986) reported the isolation and characterization of a
human erythrocyte acylphosphatase isoenzyme. The protein contains 98
amino acid residues; it has an acetylated N terminus and does not
contain cysteine. It shares 56% sequence identity with human muscle
acylphosphatase. The erythrocyte enzyme showed hydrolytic activity on
acyl phosphates with higher affinity than the muscle enzyme for some
substrates and phosphorylated inhibitors.

Fiaschi et al. (1995) isolated and characterized 3 independent cDNAs
coding for the erythrocyte isoform. All the clones were incomplete at
the 5-prime end, but Northern blot analysis using cDNA as a probe showed
the presence of an unusually long 5-prime untranslated region in the
mRNA.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and FISH, Fiaschi et al. (1998)
mapped the ACYP1 gene to human chromosome 14q24.3.

603456	TITLE *603456 DPH2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; DPH2
;;DPH2-LIKE 2; DPH2L2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Diphthamide is a unique posttranslationally modified histidine found
only in translation elongation factor-2 (EEF2; 130610). This
modification is conserved from archaebacteria to humans and serves as
the target for ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of EEF2 by diphtheria
toxin (DT) and Pseudomonas exotoxin A. DPH2 is 1 of several enzymes
involved in synthesis of diphthamide in EEF2 (Liu et al., 2004).

CLONING

Mattheakis et al. (1993) found that dph2, a S. cerevisiae diphtheria
resistance gene, encodes a protein involved in diphthamide biosynthesis.
By searching an EST database, Schultz et al. (1998) identified a human
cDNA with 63% identity to the corresponding nucleotide sequence of human
DPH2-like 1 (DPH2L1, or DPH1; 603527). Using a PCR strategy, they
recovered cDNAs corresponding to the entire coding region of the gene,
which they called DPH2L2. The predicted 489-amino acid protein shared
24% and 28% sequence identity with DPH2L1 and yeast dph2, respectively.
Northern blot analysis revealed that DPH2L2 was expressed ubiquitously
as a 2.5-kb mRNA. An additional 3-kb transcript was found in several
tissues.

Liu et al. (2004) cloned mouse Dph2. The deduced 489-amino acid protein
shares 83% identity with human DPH2.

GENE FUNCTION

Liu et al. (2004) showed that mouse Dph2 could complement the
DT-resistant phenotype of diphthamide-deficient mutant Chinese hamster
ovary cell lines. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that yeast and
mouse Dph1 (603527) and Dph2 interacted, suggesting that these enzymes
may function in diphthamide biosynthesis as a dimer or multimer.

Carette et al. (2009) used insertional mutagenesis to develop a
screening method to generate null alleles in a human cell line haploid
for all chromosomes except chromosome 8. Using this approach, they
identified genes encoding important elements of the biosynthetic pathway
of diphthamide, which are required for the cytotoxic effects of
diphtheria toxin and exotoxin A. Mutants of the DPH1, DPH2, and DPH5
(611075) genes, involved in diphthamide biosynthesis, were identified as
resistant to both anthrax toxin and diphtheria toxin.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Schultz et al. (1998) mapped the
DPH2L2 gene to 1p34.

611255	TITLE *611255 NADPH OXIDASE ACTIVATOR 1; NOXA1
;;NOX ACTIVATOR 1;;
p51-NOX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NADPH oxidases (NOXs) catalyze the transfer of electrons from NADPH to
molecular oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The NOX
activator NOXA1 can stimulate both NOX1 (300225) and NOX2 (CYBB;
300481), but it appears to be more effective in activating NOX1 (Opitz
et al., 2007).

CLONING

By searching EST databases with the C-terminal SH3 domain of p67-PHOX
(NCF2; 608515), followed by PCR, Takeya et al. (2003) cloned NOXA1,
which they called p51-NOX. The deduced 476-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 51 kD. It has 4 N-terminal
tetratricopeptide repeat motifs, followed by a central activation
domain, a PB1 (Phox and Bem1) domain, and a C-terminal SH3 domain. PCR
analysis detected abundant p51-NOX expression in pancreas, with weaker
expression in liver, kidney, spleen, prostate, small intestine, and
colon. p51-NOX expressed in COS-7 cells had an apparent molecular mass
of 53 to 54 kD by SDS-PAGE.

By Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues, Banfi et al. (2003) found
predominant expression of Noxa1 and Noxo1 (611256) in colon, with lower
levels in uterus, small intestine, and stomach. Testis expressed Noxo1,
but not Noxa1. In situ hybridization showed both Noxa1 and Noxo1 in
colon epithelial cells.

Using Western blot analysis, Ambasta et al. (2006) detected Noxa1 in the
cytosolic fraction of mouse vascular smooth muscle cells, but not in
human leukocytes, which expressed p67-PHOX. Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed that Noxa1 was expressed in the smooth muscle layer, but not in
endothelium or the adventitia, of mouse carotid artery.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid assays, Takeya et al. (2003) showed that human
p51-NOX interacted with constitutively active forms of RAC1 (602048) and
RAC2 (602049). In vitro binding assays revealed that p51-NOX bound
GTP-bound RAC1, but not GDP-bound RAC1. p51-NOX also bound p47-PHOX
(NCF1; 608512) and p41-NOX (NOXO1), and trp436 within the SH3 domain of
p51-NOX was required for these interactions. Human cell lines or COS-7
cells cotransfected with p51-NOX and p41-NOX and either gp91-PHOX (CYBB;
300481) or NOX1 produced superoxide. Cells individually transfected with
NOX1, p41-NOX, or p51-NOX and cells transfected with only p41-NOX and
p51-NOX showed no superoxide production.

Banfi et al. (2003) showed that coexpression of mouse Nox1, Noxo1, and
Noxa1 increased ROS production in the absence of external stimuli in all
cell lines examined.

Ambasta et al. (2006) showed that coexpression of Noxa1 with Noxo1
targeted the Noxo1/Noxa1 complex to membranes in mouse vascular smooth
muscle cells. Antisense Noxa1 attenuated endogenous Noxa1 expression and
ROS formation in mouse vascular smooth muscle cells and prevented
agonist-induced ROS production in response to basic FGF (FGF2; 134920)
and EGF (131530).

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the NOXA1 gene to chromosome 9q34.3 based on an
alignment of the NOXA1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF039697) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

Banfi et al. (2003) mapped the mouse Noxa1 gene to chromosome 2.

607635	TITLE *607635 CARBOXYPEPTIDASE A4; CPA4
;;CPA3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the mRNA differential display technique, Huang et al. (1999)
identified a novel protein, carboxypeptidase A4, that was upregulated in
a sodium butyrate-treated prostate cancer (176807) cell line. They
assembled a full-length CPA4 cDNA, which they had designated CPA3, by
use of 5-prime RACE. The deduced 421-amino acid CPA4 protein contains 2
zinc-binding signature domains of metallocarboxypeptidases and a
16-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide. The protein shares 63% and 61%
sequence identity with human and rat CPA2 (600688), respectively.
Northern blot analysis detected strong expression of a 3-kb CPA4
transcript in prostate cancer cell lines but no expression of the gene
in any of the human tissues tested. RT-PCR detected very low expression
of CPA4 in some normal tissues, including prostate.

GENE FUNCTION

Huang et al. (1999) found that trichostatin A as well as sodium
butyrate, both inhibitors of histone deacetylase, induced CPA4 mRNA
expression, suggesting that CPA4 gene induction is mediated by histone
hyperacetylation. They also demonstrated that the induction of CPA4 by
sodium butyrate was specifically inhibited by antisense p21(WAF1)
(CDKN1A; 116899).

Because of the expression pattern of CPA4 as well as its location at a
putative prostate cancer aggressiveness locus at chromosome 7q32 (Witte
et al., 2000), Kayashima et al. (2003) investigated its imprinting
status in fetal tissues and in adult benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH;
600082). RT-PCR using 4 intragenic polymorphisms as markers showed that
CPA4 is expressed preferentially from the maternal allele in fetal
heart, lung, liver, intestine, kidney, adrenal gland, and spleen, but
not in fetal brain. It is also preferentially expressed in BPH. These
findings suggested that CPA4 is imprinted and may be a strong candidate
gene for prostate cancer aggressiveness.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Pallares et al. (2005) described the structure of CPA4 in complex with
its endogenous inhibitor, LXN (609305). CPA4 is a compact protein
hollowed out in a funnel-like shape, with the active site at the bottom
of the funnel. In the CPA4/LXN complex, CPA4 is bound at the top of the
funnel by the interface of the N- and C-terminal subdomains of LXN. The
complex occludes a large contact surface but makes few contacts.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kayashima et al. (2003) determined that the CPA4 gene consists of 11
exons.

MAPPING

In a search for novel imprinted genes in the vicinity of the imprinted
gene MEST (601029) on chromosome 7q32, Kayashima et al. (2003)
identified the CPA4 gene in a cluster with other members of the
carboxypeptidase family, 200 kb centromeric to MEST.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

One or more imprinted genes on chromosome 7q32-qter have been postulated
to be involved in the interuterine growth retardation associated with
Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS; 180860) as 7 to 10% of patients have
maternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Bentley et al. (2003) found that the
imprinted region on 7q32 extends to the carboxypepidase A gene cluster.
SNP analysis by sequencing RT-PCR products of CPA1 (114850), CPA2, CPA4,
and CPA5 (609561) indicated preferential expression of CPA4 only. As
CPA4 has a potential role in cell proliferation and differentiation, 2
preferentially expressed copies of maternal UPD patients with SRS
syndrome would result in excess expression and could alter the growth
profiles of these subjects and give rise to intrauterine growth
restriction.

Because a locus for Silver-Russell syndrome had been proposed to be
located on 7q32 and involved in imprinting, Kayashima et al. (2003)
screened for mutations in the CPA4 gene in 10 SRS patients, but found
none.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Chromosomal segregation during mitosis as well as meiosis is regulated
by kinases and phosphatases. The Aurora kinases associate with
microtubules during chromosome movement and segregation. Aurora kinase B
localizes to microtubules near kinetochores, specifically to the
specialized microtubules called K-fibers, and Aurora kinase A (603072)
localizes to centrosomes (Lampson et al., 2004).

CLONING

The Drosophila 'aurora' and S. cerevisiae Ipl1 serine/threonine protein
kinases (STKs) are involved in mitotic events such as centrosome
separation and chromosome segregation. Using a degenerate primer-based
PCR method to screen for novel STKs, Shindo et al. (1998) isolated mouse
and human cDNAs encoding STK12, which they termed ARK2 (aurora-related
kinase-2). Sequence analysis of human STK12 predicted a 344-amino acid
protein containing kinase domains that share high homology with the
catalytic domains of other STKs. Cell cycle and Northern blot analyses
showed that STK12 is expressed in the S phase and persistently
thereafter. Western blot analysis indicated that STK12 is localized in
the midbodies during anaphase.

By searching sequence databases for clones homologous to AIK (AURKA;
603072), Kimura et al. (1998) obtained a cDNA encoding STK12, which they
designated AIK2 (aurora/Ip11-like kinase-2). Northern blot analysis
detected strong expression of a 1.5-kb STK12 transcript in thymus, with
weaker expression in small intestine, testis, colon, spleen, and brain.
Western blot analysis demonstrated expression of a 39-kD STK12 protein.

By screening a HeLa cell cDNA library with a rat Aim1 (aurora- and
Ipl1-like midbody-associated protein) probe, Katayama et al. (1998)
isolated a cDNA encoding STK12. A kinase-negative STK12 mutant was shown
to induce a failure in cytokinesis during mitosis. The authors found
that during differentiation of megakaryocytes, there is no cytokinesis
and reduced expression of STK12. Tatsuka et al. (1998) found that STK12
is highly expressed as a 1.2-kb transcript in transformed cell lines but
not in normal fibroblasts. They also showed that STK12 is associated
with multinuclearity and polyploidy.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins from transfected
HEK293 cells, Kunitoku et al. (2003) demonstrated direct interaction
between CENPA (117139) and AURKA. In vitro, AURKA phosphorylated CENPA
on ser7, a residue that is also phosphorylated by AURKB. Examination of
the role of both kinases in the phosphorylation of CENPA revealed that
the reaction is mediated sequentially by AURKA and AURKB in early
mitosis. Mitotic cells in which the phosphorylation of CENPA on ser7 was
prevented exhibited a substantial proportion of misaligned chromosomes
resulting from a defect in the ability of kinetochores to attach to
microtubules.

Lampson et al. (2004) examined the role of Aurora kinases during mitosis
in rat kangaroo kidney cells with use of small reversible inhibitors of
molecular motors and Aurora kinases. Maloriented chromosomes accumulated
in the presence of an Aurora kinase inhibitor following spindle
bipolarization. The inhibitor was removed to activate the kinase and the
orientation of the chromosomes was corrected. In the correction process,
the maloriented chromosomes first moved to the pole, then moved to the
opposite pole, resulting in alignment at the metaphase plate. The manner
of K-fiber shortening suggested that kinetochores remained attached to
the microtubule plus ends, and that Aurora B function had been
interrupted by the inhibitor. Lampson et al. (2004) concluded that
syntelic malorientations (both sister kinetocores attached to the same
pole) can be corrected by selective K-fiber disassembly, coupled with
movement to the pole.

Andrews et al. (2004) presented evidence that Aurora B inhibits the
microtubule depolymerizing activity of mitotic centromere-associated
kinesin (MCAK; 604538) by phosphorylating MCAK on ser92. This
phosphorylation also regulated MCAK translocalization from kinetochores
to the centromere, and disruption of Aurora B function prevented
centromeric MCAK targeting. Andrews et al. (2004) concluded that Aurora
B regulates MCAK activity and cellular localization.

Hirota et al. (2005) showed that antibodies against mitotic chromosome
antigens that are associated with human autoimmune diseases specifically
recognize histone H3 (see 602810) molecules that are modified by both
trimethylation of lys9 and phosphorylation of ser10 (H3K9me3S10ph). The
generation of H3K9me3S10ph depends on Suv39h (see 300254) and Aurora B,
and occurs at pericentric heterochromatin during mitosis in different
eukaryotes. Most heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1; 604478) typically
dissociates from chromosomes during mitosis, but if phosphorylation of
H3 ser10 is inhibited, HP1 remains chromosome-bound throughout mitosis.
H3 phosphorylation by Aurora B is therefore part of a 'methyl/phos
switch' mechanism that displaces HP1 and perhaps other proteins from
mitotic heterochromatin.

Ramadan et al. (2007) showed that p97 (601023) stimulates nucleus
reformation by inactivating the chromatin-associated kinase Aurora B.
During mitosis, Aurora B inhibits nucleus reformation by preventing
chromosome decondensation and formation of the nuclear envelope
membrane. During exit from mitosis, p97 binds to Aurora B after its
ubiquitylation and extracts it from chromatin. This leads to
inactivation of Aurora B on chromatin, thus allowing chromatin
decondensation and nuclear envelope formation. Ramadan et al. (2007)
concluded that their data revealed an essential pathway that regulates
reformation of the nucleus after mitosis and defined ubiquitin-dependent
protein extraction as a common mechanism of Cdc48/p97 activity also
during nucleus formation.

Rosasco-Nitcher et al. (2008) investigated the activation of Aurora B
and described 2 distinct activation mechanisms. First, Aurora B
activation in vitro requires 2 cofactors, telophase disc-60 kD, or TD60
(RCC2; 609587) and microtubules. TD60 is critical to localize both the
chromosome passenger complex (CPC) and haspin (609240) kinase activity
to centromeres and thus regulates Aurora B at several levels. Second,
Aurora B substrates can inhibit kinase activation, and this is relieved
by phosphorylation of these substrates by the centromeric kinases Plk1
(602098) and haspin. Rosasco-Nitcher et al. (2008) concluded that these
regulatory mechanisms suggested models for phosphorylation by Aurora B
of centromeric substrates at unaligned chromosomes and merotelic
attachments.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a HeLa cell cDNA library and pull-down
assays using recombinant proteins, Sun et al. (2008) showed that the
C-terminal tail of EB1 (MAPRE1; 603108) interacted specifically with the
catalytic domain of AURKB. The proteins colocalized on the central
spindle in anaphase and in the midbody during cytokinesis in simian
kidney cells, and endogenous EB1 and AURKB coimmunoprecipitated from
HeLa cells. EB1 overexpression enhanced AURKB kinase activity, and
knockdown of EB1 with small interfering RNA impaired AURKB activity. EB1
protected AURKB from dephosphorylation/inactivation by protein
phosphatase-2A (PP2A; see 176915) by blocking binding of PP2A to AURKB.
Sun et al. (2008) concluded that EB1 stimulates AURKB activity by
antagonizing its dephosphorylation/inactivation by PP2A.

Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors to measure
localized phosphorylation dynamics in living cells, Liu et al. (2009)
found that phosphorylation of an Aurora B substrate at the kinetochore
depended on its distance from the kinase at the inner centromere.
Furthermore, repositioning Aurora B closer to the kinetochore prevented
stabilization of bioriented attachments and activated the spindle
checkpoint. Thus, Liu et al. (2009) concluded that centromere tension
can be sensed by increased spatial separation of Aurora B from
kinetochore substrates, which reduces phosphorylation and stabilizes
kinetochore microtubules.

Wang et al. (2010) showed that phosphorylation of histone H3 threonine-3
(H3T3) by haspin is necessary for CPC accumulation at centromeres and
that the CPC subunit survivin (603352) binds directly to phosphorylated
H3T3 (H3T3ph). A nonbinding survivin-D70A/D71A mutant did not support
CPC complex concentration, and both haspin depletion and
survivin-D70A/D71A mutation diminished centromere localization of the
kinesin MCAK (604538) and the mitotic checkpoint response to taxol.
Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation and microinjection of H3T3ph-specific
antibody both compromised centromeric Aurora B functions but did not
prevent cytokinesis. Therefore, Wang et al. (2010) concluded that H3T3ph
generated by haspin positions the CPC at centromeres to regulate
selected targets of Aurora B during mitosis.

Kelly et al. (2010) demonstrated that H3T3ph is directly recognized by
an evolutionarily conserved binding pocket in the BIR domain of the CPC
subunit survivin. This binding mediates recruitment of the CPC to
chromosomes and the resulting activation of its kinase subunit Aurora B.
Consistently, modulation of the kinase activity of haspin, which
phosphorylates H3T3, leads to defects in the Aurora B-dependent
processes of spindle assembly and inhibition of nuclear reformation.
Kelly et al. (2010) concluded that their findings established a direct
cellular role for mitotic H3T3 phosphorylation, which is read and
translated by the CPC to ensure accurate cell division.

Yamagishi et al. (2010) showed that phosphorylation of H3T3 mediated by
haspin cooperates with bub1 (602452)-mediated histone 2A-serine-121
(H2A-S121) phosphorylation in targeting the CPC to the inner centromere
in fission yeast and human cells. Phosphorylated H3T3 promotes
nucleosome binding of survivin, whereas phosphorylated H2A-S121
facilitates the binding of shugoshin (609168), the centromeric CPC
adaptor. Haspin colocalizes with cohesin by associating with Pds5 (see
613200), whereas bub1 localizes at kinetochores. Thus, Yamagishi et al.
(2010) concluded that the inner centromere is defined by intersection of
2 histone kinases.

Campbell and Desai (2013) showed that an engineered truncation of the
Sli15 (INCENP; 604411) subunit of budding yeast CPC that eliminates
association with the inner centromere nevertheless supports proper
chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis. Truncated Sli15
suppressed the deletion phenotypes of the inner centromere-targeting
proteins Bir1 (survivin), Nbl1 (borealin; 609977), Bub1, and Sgo1
(shugoshin). Unlike wildtype Sli15, truncated Sli15 localized to
preanaphase spindle microtubules. Premature targeting of full-length
Sli15 to microtubules by preventing Cdk1 (110940) phosphorylation also
suppressed the inviability of Bir1 deletion. Campbell and Desai (2013)
concluded that activation of Aurora B kinase by clustering either on
chromatin or on microtubules is sufficient for chromosome biorientation.

MAPPING

By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Kimura et al. (1998) mapped the
STK12 gene to 17p13.1. Tatsuka et al. (1998) noted that the STK12 gene
is localized in a region that is frequently deleted in tumors and that
contains tumor-related genes such as p53 (191170), CRK (164762), and ABR
(600365). Using interspecific backcross mapping, Shindo et al. (1998)
mapped the mouse Stk12 gene to chromosome 11 in a region showing
homology of synteny with human 17p.

613259	TITLE *613259 REPETIN; RPTN
DESCRIPTION The RPTN gene encodes repetin, an extracellular epidermal matrix protein
that is expressed in the epidermis and at high levels in eccrine sweat
glands, the inner sheaths of hair roots, and the filiform papilli of the
tongue (summary by Green et al., 2010).

CLONING

Using mouse Rptn to probe a human chromosome 1-specific cosmid library,
followed by 5-prime RACE of human keratinocyte RNA, Huber et al. (2005)
cloned full-length RPTN. The deduced 784-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 91 kD. RPTN contains 2 N-terminal EF hand
motifs, a central domain containing 28 repeats of the consensus sequence
QxDRQGQSSHYG, and a glutamine- and arginine-rich C-terminal domain.
Northern blot analysis detected a 4-kb RPTN transcript in human thymus,
epidermis, and foreskin and in keratinocyte suspension cultures. Very
low expression was detected in adherent keratinocyte cultures, and none
was detected in other tissues. Immunofluorescence analysis detected RPTN
in the upper granular layer of human interfollicular epidermis, in
acrosyringium, in the upper cell layers of foreskin epidermis, in a
granular pattern in filiform papillae of tongue, in upper layer cells of
lingual interpapillae, and in the inner root sheath of hair follicle.
Immunoelectron microscopy showed strongest RPTN immunoreactivity in
granular layers associated with keratohyalin granules, with more diffuse
cytoplasmic expression in the transition zone between stratum granulosum
and stratum corneum. RPTN was not expressed in upper cornified layers of
skin. RPTN had an apparent molecular mass of 100 kD by SDS-PAGE.

GENE FUNCTION

Huber et al. (2005) showed that the recombinant N-terminal domain of
RPTN bound calcium reversibly.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huber et al. (2005) determined that the RPTN gene contains 3 exons and
spans at least 5.6 kb. The first exon is noncoding.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Huber et al. (2005) mapped the
RPTN gene to chromosome 1q21, where it lies between the trichohyalin
(TCHH; 190370) and profilaggrin (FLG; 135940) genes within the epidermal
differentiation complex. They mapped the mouse Rptn gene to a region of
chromosome 3F that shares homology of synteny with human chromosome
1q21.

EVOLUTION

Green et al. (2010) published a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome.
Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of 5 present-day
humans from different parts of the world identified a number of genomic
regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral
modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive
and skeletal development. Green et al. (2010) found 78 nucleotide
substitutions that change the protein coding capacity of genes where
modern humans are fixed for a derived state and where Neandertals carry
the ancestral (chimpanzee-like) state. Thus, relatively few amino acid
changes have become fixed in the last few hundred thousand years of
human evolution, an observation consistent with a complementary study
(Burbano et al., 2010). There are only 5 genes with more than 1 fixed
substitution changing the primary structure of the encoding proteins.
One of these is RPTN, which encodes repetin, an extracellular epidermal
matrix protein that is expressed in the epidermis and at high levels in
eccrine sweat glands, the inner sheaths of hair roots, and the filiform
papilli of the tongue. Green et al. (2010) also showed that Neandertals
shared more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than
with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow
from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the
divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.

306250	TITLE *306250 COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR 2 RECEPTOR, ALPHA; CSF2RA
;;GRANULOCYTE-MACROPHAGE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR RECEPTOR, LOW AFFINITY,
ALPHA SUBUNIT; GMCSFR
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF, or CSF2;
138960) activates STAT5 (601511) and other signaling pathways via
binding to a cell surface receptor composed of a ligand-binding alpha
subunit, encoded by CSF2RA, and a nonbinding affinity-enhancing beta
subunit, encoded by CSF2RB (138981) (Suzuki et al., 2008).

CLONING

Using an expression cloning strategy, Gearing et al. (1989) isolated a
cDNA encoding CSF2RA, which they called GMCSFR, from a human placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 400-amino acid precursor protein has a
22-amino acid signal peptide. The 378-amino acid mature protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 43.7 kD and contains a single transmembrane
domain, a glycosylated extracellular domain, and a short
intracytoplasmic tail. Northern blot analysis detected GMCSFR expression
in a variety of hemopoietic cells displaying GMCSF binding.

Raines et al. (1991) identified a truncated, soluble form of the
low-affinity GMCSF receptor in choriocarcinoma cells. Clones encoding
the soluble receptor were identical in sequence to the membrane-bound
form except for a 97-nucleotide deletion. The amino acid sequence of
this deleted cDNA predicted a protein that lacks the 84 C-terminal amino
acids of the membrane-bound receptor, including the transmembrane and
cytoplasmic domains, and contains 16 different amino acids at its C
terminus. RNase protection analysis indicated that this variant cDNA was
derived from a naturally occurring mRNA. Soluble receptors had been
identified for several other hematopoietin receptors and may be a
general feature of this class. It is likely that alternative mRNA
splicing is the mechanism by which the soluble counterparts are
generated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rappold et al. (1992) found that the CSF2RA gene spans at least 45 kb.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of a panel of mouse-human somatic cell
hybrids, Gough et al. (1990) demonstrated that the CSF2R gene is on the
X chromosome. The possibility that an allele also maps to the Y
chromosome was suggested by the observation that many DNA samples from
normal males carry 2 alleles of this gene. Among 65 normal persons, 23
females and 20 males were homozygous for an allele of fragment A,
whereas 8 females and 14 males were heterozygous. By in situ
hybridization, Gough et al. (1990) showed that the CSF2R gene maps to
the tip of the short arm of the X chromosome and the short arm of the Y
chromosome (see 425000), with the most likely localization being
Xpter-p21 and Ypter-p11.2. Although this information was consistent with
its location in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), conclusive proof
required study of segregation of the locus with respect to sexual
phenotype. They found in a total of 14 informative male meioses, 3
recombination events; i.e., in 2 cases a daughter had inherited the
allele from the paternal Y chromosome, and in 1 instance a son had
inherited the allele from the paternal X chromosome. Thus, the CSF2R
locus is distal to the MIC2 locus (313470), which shows only about 2.5%
recombination and maps close to the PAR boundary. This was the first
localization of a gene of known function to this region, which
encompasses about 2,500 kb.

By pulsed field gel electrophoresis, Rappold et al. (1992) localized the
CSF2RA gene 1,180 to 1,300 kb from the telomere, in close proximity to
the CpG island B5. The gene showed abundant hypervariable sequences, and
a number of informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms were
defined. Rappold et al. (1992) suggested that these polymorphisms might
be useful in proving the pseudoautosomal inheritance of apparently
autosomal traits, as has been suggested for schizophrenia (Crow, 1988),
cerebral dominance (Crow, 1989), and Kabuki make-up syndrome (Niikawa et
al., 1988; 147920), among others.

Rappold (1993) discussed in detail the pseudoautosomal regions that
exist at the tips of the short and long arms of the X and Y chromosomes
and cover 2.6 and 0.4 Mb, respectively.

By both in situ hybridization and linkage analysis, Disteche et al.
(1992) found that the murine Csf2ra gene maps to chromosome 19.

GENE FUNCTION

DiPersio et al. (1988) studied the binding of GMCSF, over a wide range
of concentrations, to normal human peripheral blood cells, bone marrow,
acute and chronic myeloid leukemia cells, and a number of established
human myeloid and nonmyeloid cell lines; thereby, they defined the
receptors.

Gearing et al. (1989) found that transfection of GMCSFR cDNA into COS
cells directed expression of a GMCSF receptor showing a single class of
affinity and specificity for human GMCSF, but not interleukin-3 (IL3;
147740).

Hayashida et al. (1990) showed that the high-affinity GMCSF receptor is
composed of at least 2 components in a manner analogous to the IL2
receptor (see 147730). They proposed to designate the low-affinity GMCSF
receptor as the alpha subunit, and the 'new' protein that they
identified and called KH97 as the beta subunit (see 138981). The 2
subunits are approximately 80 and 120 kD, respectively.

Raines et al. (1991) found that expression of the variant cDNA encoding
the truncated, soluble CSF2R isoform produced a secreted protein that
retained its capacity to bind CSF2 in solution.

Kondo et al. (2000) showed that a clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor,
a bone marrow-resident cell that gives rise exclusively to lymphocytes
(T, B, and natural killer cells), can be redirected to the myeloid
lineage by stimulation through exogenously expressed interleukin-2
receptor (146710) and GMCSF receptor. Analysis of mutants of the
beta-chain of the IL2 receptor revealed that the granulocyte and
monocyte differentiation signals are triggered by different cytoplasmic
domains, showing that the signaling pathways responsible for these
unique developmental outcomes are separable. Finally, Kondo et al.
(2000) showed that the endogenous myelomonocytic cytokine receptors for
GMCSF and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1R; 164770) are
expressed at low to moderate levels on the more primitive hematopoietic
stem cells, are absent on common lymphoid progenitors, and are
upregulated after myeloid lineage induction by IL2 (147680). Kondo et
al. (2000) concluded that cytokine signaling can regulate cell fate
decisions and proposed that a critical step in lymphoid commitment is
downregulation of cytokine receptors that drive myeloid cell
development.

Loss of either the X or the Y chromosome is apparent in 25% of acute
myeloid leukemias of the M2 subtype (AML-M2), compared with only 1 to 6%
in other AML subtypes, suggesting the involvement of a 'recessive
oncogene' in the genesis of M2 AMLs. The presumed gene is likely to be
in the PAR, because if it were located in the portion of the X
chromosome not shared with the Y, then similar loss of the Y chromosome
would not be predicted, and vice versa. Gough et al. (1990) suggested
that CSF2R may be the gene in question. Loss or inactivation of both
copies of the gene in a myeloid progenitor cell would be expected to
result in a clone of cells unable to respond to GMCSF, and hence in the
relatively undifferentiated phenotype of the M2 form of leukemia.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder in which
surfactant-derived lipoproteins accumulate excessively within pulmonary
alveoli, causing severe respiratory distress. It is a disorder of
surfactant metabolism. The importance of CSF2 in the pathogenesis of PAP
has been confirmed in humans and mice, wherein CSF2 signaling is
required for pulmonary alveolar macrophage catabolism of surfactant.
Using flow cytometry, Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) found that
CSF2RA was absent on monocytes from a 4-year-old girl with PAP due to
pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction (SMDP4; 300770). The
patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas the
patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation of
monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 induced upregulation of
CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the patient. Karyotypic
analysis showed that the patient had 1 X chromosome of apparently normal
length and 1 X chromosome with a truncated Xp arm that did not hybridize
with a PAR1 probe. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in
leukocytes from the patient's family members, but not in those from the
patient. PCR analysis of the 11 coding exons of the CSF2RA gene revealed
a deletion of exons 5 through 13 (306250.0001) in the patient's DNA,
providing a genetic basis for the absence of CSF2RA mRNA and protein.

Using flow cytometry, Suzuki et al. (2008) found that both CSF2RA and
CSF2RB were present on leukocytes from 2 sisters with PAP, as well as
all family members tested. However, Western blot analysis showed that
the affected sisters expressed only a truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas
their father was heterozygous for the normal and truncated forms, and
their mother expressed only normal CSF2RA. CSF2 binding and
CSF2-dependent signaling were severely reduced, but not abolished, in
the sisters, and their CD11B stimulation test was abnormal. Suzuki et
al. (2008) identified a mutation in the CSF2RA gene in the affected
sisters that resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R; 306250.0002)
substitution. The father was heterozygous for the G174R mutation, but
the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed that CSF2RA
copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but not in the
father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of PAR1, including
the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome of the sisters and mother. Suzuki et
al. (2008) concluded that PAP may be caused by compound heterozygous
abnormalities affecting the CSF2RA gene, and that CSF2 signaling is
critical for surfactant homeostasis in humans.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schweizerhof et al. (2009) presented evidence that GCSF (CSF3; 138970)
and GMCSF mediate bone cancer pain and tumor-nerve interactions.
Increased levels of both factors were detected in bone marrow lysates
and adjoining connective tissue in a mouse sarcoma model of bone
tumor-induced pain compared to controls. The functional receptors GCSFR
(CSF3R; 138971) and GMCSFR were expressed on peripheral nerves in the
bone matrix and in dorsal root ganglia. GMCSF sensitized nerves to
mechanical stimuli in vitro and in vivo, potentiated CGRP (114130)
release, and caused sprouting of sensory nerve endings in the skin. RNA
interference of GCSF and GMCSF signaling in the mouse sarcoma model led
to reduced tumor growth and nerve remodeling, and abrogated bone cancer
pain.

In a 4-year-old girl with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (300770),
Martinez-Moczygemba et al. (2008) identified a deletion of exons 5
through 13 in the CSF2RA gene. Karyotypic analysis showed that the
patient's other X chromosome had a truncated Xp arm that did not
hybridize with a probe for pseudoautosomal region-1, which contains
CSF2RA. The patient's mother expressed CSF2RA on all monocytes, whereas
the patient's father and sister expressed CSF2RA only on a subpopulation
of monocytes. Stimulation of granulocytes with CSF2 (1389060) induced
upregulation of CD11B (ITGAM; 120980) in the mother, but not the
patient. RT-PCR analysis detected expression of CSF2RA in leukocytes
from the patient's family members, but not in those from the patient.

Suzuki et al. (2008) identified a G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the
CSF2RA gene in genomic DNA from 2 sisters with pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis (300770), one 6 years of age and the other 8 years of age.
The mutation resulted in a gly174-to-arg (G174R) substitution that
altered 1 of 11 potential N-glycosylation sites in the CSF2RA protein.
Western blot analysis showed that the affected sisters expressed only a
truncated form of CSF2RA, whereas their father was heterozygous for the
normal and truncated forms, and their mother expressed only normal
CSF2RA. CSF2 (138960) binding and CSF2-dependent signaling were severely
reduced, but not abolished, in the sisters, and their CD11B (120980)
stimulation test was abnormal. The father was heterozygous for the G174R
mutation, but the mother had only wildtype CSF2RA. PCR analysis showed
that CSF2RA copy number was reduced in the sisters and their mother, but
not in the father. FISH analysis demonstrated a 1.6-Mb deletion of
pseudoautosomal region-1, including the CSF2RA gene, in 1 X chromosome
of the sisters and mother. Transfection of CSF2RA with the G174R
mutation into 293 cells reproduced the CSF2 signaling defect at
physiologic CSF2 concentrations. At high CSF2 concentrations, similar to
those observed in the index patient, signaling was partially rescued,
thereby providing a molecular explanation for the slow disease
progression in the 2 sisters.

605170	TITLE *605170 ETOPOSIDE-INDUCED 1.4 mRNA; EI24
;;EI24, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
p53-INDUCED GENE 8; PIG8
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The EI24 gene is an immediate-early response gene that is directly
regulated by p53 (TP53; 191170), suppresses cell growth, and induces
cell death (Gu et al., 2000).

CLONING

DNA damage and/or hyperproliferative signals activate wildtype p53 tumor
suppressor protein (TP53; 191170), inducing cell cycle arrest or
apoptosis. Mutations that inactivate p53 occur in 50% of all tumors.
Polyak et al. (1997) used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to
evaluate cellular mRNA levels in a colorectal cancer cell line
transfected with p53. Of 7,202 transcripts identified, only 14 were
expressed at levels more than 10-fold higher in p53-expressing cells
than in control cells. Polyak et al. (1997) termed these genes
'p53-induced genes,' or PIGs, several of which, including PIG8, were
predicted to encode redox-controlling proteins. They noted that reactive
oxygen species (ROS) are potent inducers of apoptosis. Flow cytometric
analysis showed that p53 expression induces ROS production, which
increases as apoptosis progresses under some conditions. The authors
stated that PIG8 is the human homolog of murine ei24, an
etoposide-induced gene.

By analysis of a BAC clone, Gu et al. (2000) determined that the PIG8
sequence reported by Polyak et al. (1997) is incorrect and that the
corrected 358-amino acid PIG8 protein shares 98% amino acid identity
with ei24. Western blot analysis indicated that ei24 expression is
approximately 500-fold higher in dead cells than in healthy cells. Phase
contrast and fluorescence microscopy showed that cells expressing Ei24
but not those coexpressing the apoptosis suppressor BCL2L1 (600039)
displayed the typical morphologic features of apoptosis. These results
suggested that ei24 suppresses cell growth through the activation of an
apoptotic pathway.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a murine myeloid leukemia cell line expressing a
temperature-sensitive p53 gene, Gu et al. (2000) showed that ei24, the
murine homolog of PIG8, directly responds to p53 as an immediate-early
response gene and is not induced secondary to p53-mediated cell death.
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that purified
wildtype p53 protein specifically binds to a p53 response element in the
ei24 protein.

MAPPING

By FISH, Gu et al. (2000) mapped the PIG8 gene to 11q23, a region
frequently altered in cancers. Gu et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Ei24
gene to the proximal region of chromosome 9.

604097	TITLE *604097 UROTENSIN II; UTS2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Coulouarn et al. (1998) clearly established the existence of urotensin
II in mammals by characterizing cDNAs encoding the urotensin II
precursors not only in frog but also in human. In both species, the UTS2
sequence is located at the C-terminal position of the precursor. Human
UTS2 is composed of only 11 amino acid residues, while fish and frog
UTS2 possess 12 and 13 amino acid residues, respectively. The cyclic
region of UTS2, which is responsible for the biologic activity of the
peptide, has been fully conserved from fish to human. Northern blot and
dot blot analysis showed that UTS2 precursor mRNAs are found
predominantly in the frog and human spinal cord. In situ hybridization
studies showed that the UTS2 precursor gene is actively expressed in
motoneurons. The fact that evolutionary pressure has acted to conserve
fully the biologically active sequence of UTS2 suggests that the peptide
may exert important physiologic functions in humans.

GENE FUNCTION

Ames et al. (1999) identified a human G protein-coupled receptor, GPR14
(600896), which functions as a urotensin II receptor. Human urotensin II
binds to recombinant human GPR14 with high affinity, and the binding is
functionally coupled to calcium mobilization. Human urotensin II is
found within both vascular and cardiac tissue, including coronary
atheroma, and effectively constricts isolated arteries from nonhuman
primates. The potency of vasoconstriction of urotensin II was an order
of magnitude greater than that of endothelin-1 (131240), making human
urotensin II the most potent mammalian vasoconstrictor identified to
that time. In vivo, human urotensin II markedly increased total
peripheral resistance in anesthetized nonhuman primates, a response
associated with profound cardiac contractile dysfunction. Furthermore,
urotensin II immunoreactivity was found within the central nervous
system and endocrine tissues, suggesting that it may have additional
activities.

UTS2 has several cardiovascular actions, including potent vasoactive,
and cardiac inotropic and hypertropic properties. Douglas et al. (2002)
investigated the degree of expression of UTS2 and its receptor GPR14 in
the myocardium of patients with congestive heart failure. They obtained
specimens of myocardium from the hearts of 19 patients with end-stage
congestive heart failure, 5 patients with early-stage congestive heart
failure, and 8 healthy controls. They found strong expression of UTS2 in
the cardiomyocytes, and to a lesser extent in the vascular smooth muscle
cells, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells of patients with
end-stage congestive heart failure. There was significantly less UTS2
expression in the myocardium of patients with early-stage congestive
heart failure, and little or no UTS2 expression in the myocardium of
healthy controls. RT-PCR showed increased concentrations of UTS2 and the
presence of urotensin receptor mRNA in the myocardium of patients with
congestive heart failure. Confocal microscopy showed a significant
increase in the binding sites for urotensin in the myocardium of
patients with end-stage congestive heart failure.

GENE FAMILY

The caudal neurosecretory system of teleost fish, which terminates in
the urophysis, exhibits morphofunctional similarities to the
hypothalamoneurohypophyseal complex (Bern et al., 1985). Two major
regulatory peptides have been isolated from urophysial extracts and
chemically characterized. Urotensin I, a 41-amino acid peptide, is
structurally similar to mammalian corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF;
122560) and to the frog skin peptide sauvagine; urotensin II (UTS2) is a
cyclic 12-amino acid peptide that has some sequence similarity, but is
not homologous, to somatostatin-14 (see 182450). The characterization of
UTS2 from the urophysis of various teleost species has shown that the
structure of the C-terminal cyclic hexapeptide has been fully conserved,
while several substitutions have occurred in the N-terminal region of
the molecule. Subsequently it was found that urotensin II-like molecules
are present in distant taxa, from mollusks to amphibians, suggesting
that urotensin-related peptides may also occur in mammals. In support of
this hypothesis, a peptide with a high degree of sequence similarity
with UTS1, called urocortin (UCN; 600945), was characterized in the rat
and human brain. In addition, specific binding sites for urotensin II
were demonstrated in rat blood vessels, and fish urotensin II was found
to exert cardiovascular effects in rat and rabbit. It was also found
that the mouse anococcygeus muscle has special sensitivity to urotensin
II (summary by Coulouarn et al., 1998).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATP2C1 is a Golgi-localized ATPase that mediates Golgi uptake of
cytosolic Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) and has a role in regulating Ca(2+) and
Mn(2+) cellular content (Ton et al., 2002).

CLONING

Hu et al. (2000) identified an EST corresponding to the ATP2C1 gene
within a 1.3-Mb YAC/BAC contig spanning the region of chromosome
3q21-q24 deleted in a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600).
This EST had been annotated as homologous to a yeast gene encoding a
calcium ATPase with a function predicted to be related to that of SERCA2
(ATP2A2; 108740). Hu et al. (2000) isolated the full-length cDNA
corresponding to the human EST. Similar to other Ca(2+) ATPase genes,
the ATP2C1 gene encodes 2 alternatively spliced transcripts, ATP2C1a and
ATP2C1b. These transcripts differed in their C termini (encoding amino
acids 877 to the end), but had the same expression patterns in all
tissues examined. ATP2C1a was predicted to encode 919 amino acids, and
ATP2C1b was predicted to encode 888 amino acids. The protein encoded by
ATP2C1 was highly homologous (97% identity) to rat Pmr1, which in turn
is homologous to the yeast calcium pump Pmr1, but less homologous to
other calcium pumps. Northern blot analysis detected a 4.4-kb ATP2C1
transcript in keratinocytes and in all 12 whole tissues examined.
Highest expression was in kidney and heart, and lowest expression was in
colon, thymus, and leukocytes. Patients with HHD are not known to have
extracutaneous manifestations of the disease. Hu et al. (2000) found no
differences in ATP2C1 mRNA levels between skin taken from the axilla and
skin from the buttock (sites particularly prone vs resistant to
blistering, respectively, in HHD patients) of one normal individual and
little change in ATP2C1 mRNA levels in normal human epidermal
keratinocytes cultured with glucocorticoid.

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned ATP2C1 clone, which they designated
KIAA1347. The deduced 918-amino acid protein shares 97% identity with
its rat ortholog, a calcium-transporting ATPase. RT-PCR ELISA detected
variable ATP2C1 expression in all adult and fetal tissues examined, with
highest expression in ovary, followed by lung, testis, brain, liver, and
kidney. Within specific adult brain regions, highest expression was
detected in thalamus, followed by amygdala and substantia nigra.

Ton et al. (2002) showed that epitope-tagged human SPCA1 localized to
the Golgi compartment following expression in yeast and Chinese hamster
ovary cells.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hu et al. (2000) detected 27 exons in the ATP2C1 gene. Dobson-Stone et
al. (2002) detected 28 translated exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1
gene to chromosome 3. Hu et al. (2000) mapped the ATP2C1 gene to
chromosome 3q21-q24.

GENE FUNCTION

Pmr1, the yeast ortholog of SPCA1, is expressed in the Golgi compartment
and functions as a high-affinity Ca(2+)/Mn(2+) pump involved in Ca(2+)
and Mn(2+) secretion. Deletion of Pmr1 in yeast causes hypersensitivity
to Ca(2+) chelators and Mn(2+) toxicity, with defects in protein
glycosylation, processing, sorting, and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER)-related glycosylation. Ton et al. (2002) found that heterologous
expression of human SPCA1, but not SERCA-type Ca(2+)-transporting
ATPases, reduced Mn(2+) toxicity and complemented Ca(2+)-related
phenotypes in Pmr1-null yeast. Yeast Golgi vesicles expressing human
SPCA1 showed high-affinity Ca(2+) transport activity that was
inhibitable by Mn(2+), but not by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of
SERCA-type ATPases. Ton et al. (2002) proposed that SPCA1 plays a role
in maintaining Ca(2+) and Mn(2+) concentrations in Golgi and the
secretory pathway.

Using RNA interference with HeLa cells, Van Baelen et al. (2003) showed
that SPCA1 was completely responsible for thapsigargin-insensitive
Ca(2+) uptake into Golgi vesicles. Knockdown of SPCA1 did not alter
Ca(2+) handling in the ER and had only a small effect on baseline
histamine-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in whole cells.

Mukhopadhyay and Linstedt (2011) found that exposure of HeLa cells to
increased extracellular Mn(2+), but not Ca(2+), induced trafficking of
the Golgi phosphoprotein GPP130 (GOLIM4; 606805) from the Golgi to
multivesicular bodies and then to lysosomes, followed by GPP130
degradation. They showed that a gln747-to-ala (Q747A) point mutation in
SPCA1 increased Golgi uptake of cellular Mn(2+), leading to increased
GPP130 degradation and reduced Mn(2+) toxicity via secretion. In
contrast, SPCA1 containing either an asp350-to-ala (D350A) mutation,
which blocks autophosphorylation and transport of Mn(2+) and Ca(2+), or
a gly309-to-cys (G309C) mutation, which blocks transport of Mn(2+), but
not Ca(2+), reduced Golgi uptake of Mn(2+), resulting in reduced GPP130
degradation and increased Mn(2+) toxicity.

Kourtis et al. (2012) demonstrated that heat stroke triggers pervasive
necrotic cell death and neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Preconditioning
of animals at a mildly elevated temperature strongly protected from
heat-induced necrosis. The heat-shock transcription factor HSF1 (140580)
and the small heat-shock protein HSP-16.1 mediate cytoprotection by
preconditioning. HSP-16.1 localizes to the Golgi, where it functions
with the calcium- and magnesium-transporting ATPase PMR1 to maintain
calcium homeostasis under heat stroke. Preconditioning also suppresses
cell death inflicted by diverse insults, and protects mammalian neurons
from heat cytotoxicity. Kourtis et al. (2012) concluded that their
findings revealed an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that defends
against diverse necrotic stimuli. In mouse cortical neurons and striatal
cells, Kourtis et al. (2012) found that overexpression of crystallin
alpha-A (123580), which colocalizes with the Golgi marker
alpha-mannosidase-II (154582) and the PMR1 ATPase, was sufficient to
protect mammalian neurons from heat stroke-induced death, even in the
absence of preconditioning. Heat stroke caused massive necrotic death
and axonal degeneration in neurons expressing short hairpin RNAs against
Pmr1, even after preconditioning.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD; 169600) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by persistent blisters and erosions of the skin. By family
linkage studies, the HHD region was localized to 3q21-q24. Study of a
family carrying a deletion helped narrow the location. To screen HHD
patients for ATP2C1 mutations, Hu et al. (2000) identified intron sites
by comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences, designed primers flanking
the 27 identified exons, and assessed PCR products from patients and
controls by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or
conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) analyses. Among 51
unrelated kindreds of European descent and 10 of Japanese descent, they
identified 21 abnormalities (16/51 and 5/10). Of the abnormal sequences,
6 predicted single amino acid substitutions, 2 predicted aberrant
splicing, and 13 predicted prematurely truncated products through
frameshifts or single-basepair substitution. A high frequency of the
last type of mutation supported a haploinsufficiency pathogenesis
consistent with the complete deletion of the gene in 1 kindred and
further suggested that calcium pumps of the PMR1 family function as
monomers. The mechanism by which mutant ATPC1 causes acantholysis is
unknown, but it may be through abnormally elevated cytoplasmic calcium
or abnormally low Golgi Ca(2+) levels. Elevated cytoplasmic calcium
might act by altering posttranslational modification of proteins or by
inducing changes in gene expression.

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified 13 different mutations, including
nonsense, frameshift insertion and deletions, splice-site mutations, and
nonconservative missense mutations, in ATP2C1 in patients with
Hailey-Hailey disease. The identification of ATP2A2 as the gene
defective in Darier disease (124200) provided further evidence of the
critical role of Ca(2+) signaling in maintaining epidermal integrity.

Ikeda et al. (2001) reported ATP2C1 mutations in 11 Japanese patients
with Hailey-Hailey disease. Some affected individuals had unique
clinical features (generalization of Hailey-Hailey disease and
generalized skin eruption resembling keratotic papules in Darier
disease), but other affected individuals did not, suggesting the
presence of intrafamilial phenotypic variations. These findings
reinforced the conclusion that differences in clinical phenotypes in
Hailey-Hailey disease are probably related to factors other than the
type of causative mutation.

Chao et al. (2002) identified 7 different ATP2C1 mutations, 6 of them
novel, in 7 Taiwanese kindreds with Hailey-Hailey disease. They found 3
deletion mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, 1 missense mutation, and 1
splicing mutation.

Dobson-Stone et al. (2002) screened all 28 translated exons of ATP2C1 in
24 Hailey-Hailey disease families and 3 sporadic cases and identified 22
mutations (18 novel) in 25 probands. The novel mutations comprised 3
nonsense, 6 insertion/deletion, 3 splice site, and 6 missense mutations,
and were distributed throughout the ATP2C1 gene. They noted that 6 of
the mutations were found in multiple families in their study as well as
in the studies of Sudbrak et al. (2000) and Hu et al. (2000). Haplotype
analysis revealed that 2 of these were recurrent mutations. Comparison
between genotype and phenotype in 23 families failed to yield any clear
correlation between the nature of the mutation and clinical features of
Hailey-Hailey disease. The extensive inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic
variability suggested that modifying genes and/or environmental factors
may greatly influence the clinical features of this disease.

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease, Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a
splice site mutation in exon 22 of the ATP2C1 gene (604384.0009).
Haplotype analysis of the more severely affected segmental skin regions
revealed consistent loss of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the
authors' hypothesis that such segmental exacerbations represent a form
of mosaicism with hemizygosity for the mutation.

insertion resulted in a frameshift with a premature termination codon 42
amino acids downstream of the mutation.

.0002

In a family with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al. (2000)
identified a G-to-T transversion of nucleotide 910 of the ATP2C1 gene,
resulting in an ala304-to-thr amino acid substitution.

In 2 unrelated families with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Hu et al.
(2000) found an identical 4-bp deletion of 2374delTTTG in the ATP2C1
gene. The 2 families had different alleles of the D3S1587 marker, a
locus less than 100 kb from the mutant gene, on the mutant chromosome.
This may indicate that these were independent mutations. The deletion
resulted in a premature termination codon 10 amino acids downstream of
the mutation.

Sudbrak et al. (2000) identified a G-to-A transition at the 3-prime end
of intron 11 (nucleotide position 852) of the ATP2C1 gene in a family
with Hailey-Hailey disease (169600). The effect on the cDNA was not
determined.

In a Japanese patient who represented a sporadic occurrence of
Hailey-Hailey disease (169600), Yokota et al. (2002) reported a

in a leu584-to-pro (L584P) amino acid substitution.

.0009
HAILEY-HAILEY DISEASE
ATP2C1, IVS22, G-A, +1

In a patient with unilateral segmental exacerbations of Hailey-Hailey
disease (169600), originally reported by Vakilzadeh and Kolde (1985),
Poblete-Gutierrez et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a G-to-A
transition at the first base of the consensus splice donor site of exon
22 of the ATP2C1 gene. The mutation, which they designated 2146+1G-A,
resulted in the skipping of the 69-bp exon 22. Haplotype analysis of the
more severely affected segmental skin regions revealed consistent loss
of the paternal wildtype allele, confirming the authors' hypothesis that
such segmental exacerbations represent a form of mosaicism with
hemizygosity for the mutation.

LIVER AND FIBROBLAST GST1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The glutathione S-transferases (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of
enzymes responsible for the metabolism of a broad range of xenobiotics
and carcinogens (Mannervik, 1985). This enzyme catalyzes the reaction of
glutathione with a wide variety of organic compounds to form thioethers,
a reaction that is sometimes a first step in a detoxification process
leading to mercapturic acid formation.

Based on amino acid sequence similarities and antibody
cross-reactivities, the mammalian cytosolic GSTs are divided into
several classes, including alpha (e.g., 138359), mu, kappa (602321),
theta (e.g., 600436), pi (134660), omega (605482), and zeta (603758). In
addition, there is a class of microsomal GSTs (e.g., 138330). Each class
is encoded by a single gene or a gene family.

CLONING

Board (1981) showed that the most active GSTs of liver are the products
of 2 autosomal loci, GST1 (GSTM1) and GST2 (GSTA2; 138360), both of
which are polymorphic.

Strange et al. (1984) reported that GST1 is easily demonstrable in adult
liver, kidney, adrenal and stomach but is only weakly expressed in
skeletal and cardiac muscle and not at all in fetal liver, fibroblasts,
erythrocytes, lymphocytes and platelets. GST2 is not detectable in the
last 4 tissues but is found in many other tissues including fetal liver.
GST3 (GSTP1; 134660) is found in every tissue except adult liver.

DeJong et al. (1988) isolated a cDNA clone that encodes a human liver
GST H(b) subunit representing GST1.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, DeJong et al. (1988) mapped the GST1 gene to
chromosome 1p31. Zhong et al. (1992) used oligonucleotide primers
specific for intron 5 sequences in the GSTM1 gene to amplify a unique
718-bp fragment. They confirmed the assignment to 1p by analysis of DNA
from a panel of somatic cell hybrids and refined the localization to
1p13 by linkage analysis in 3-generation CEPH families.

Pearson et al. (1993) used locus-specific PCR primer pairs spanning exon
6, intron 6, and exon 7 as probes on DNA from human/hamster somatic cell
hybrids to map 5 glutathione transferase genes to chromosome 1: GSTM1,
GSTM2 (138380), GSTM3 (138390), GSTM4 (138333), and GSTM5 (138385). For
GSTM1, the assignment was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. The
organization of the 5 genes was confirmed by the isolation of a YAC
clone that contained all 5. With this clone, the location of this
cluster on chromosome 1 was confirmed by fluorescence in situ
hybridization and regionalized to a point in or near 1p13.3. Xu et al.
(1998) reported that 4 mu GST genes are tightly clustered. These genes
are spaced approximately 20 kb apart and are arranged in the following
order: 5-prime--GSTM4--GSTM2--GSTM1--GSTM5--3-prime.

Islam et al. (1989) mapped a GST mu gene to human chromosome 3 (138385).

NOMENCLATURE

Mannervik et al. (1992) gave recommendations on nomenclature for human
glutathione transferases.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

A null allele at the GSTM1 locus has a high frequency of about 0.7
(Board et al., 1990). The GST1 null phenotype has a frequency of greater
than 50% among Caucasian, Chinese, and Indian populations (Board, 1981;
Board et al., 1990).

The GSTM1 null phenotype appears to be caused by the deletion of the
GSTM1 gene (Seidegard et al., 1988, 1990).

The close physical proximity of the GSTM1 and GSTM2 loci, which share
99% nucleotide sequence identity over 460 nucleotides of 3-prime
untranslated mRNA, suggested to Pearson et al. (1993) that the GSTM1
null allele may result from unequal crossing-over. Xu et al. (1998)
constructed a partial physical map of the GST gene cluster on 1p13.3 and
localized the end points of the GSTM1 deletion. The same deletion was
found in 13 unrelated individuals (20 null alleles) examined.

In a study of liver specimens from 168 autopsies in Japanese
individuals, Harada et al. (1987) found that the null allele of GST1 was
more frequent in livers with hepatitis and carcinoma than in control
livers. This supported the notion of Board (1981) that individuals with
the null allele are exposed to elevated levels of certain electrophilic
carcinogens.

GSTM1 deficiency may be a risk factor for cancer by providing increased
sensitivity to particular chemical carcinogens (Strange et al., 1991;
van Poppel et al., 1992). Seidegard et al. (1986, 1990) found an
association between the GSTM1 null phenotype and susceptibility to lung
cancer.

Zhong et al. (1993) found a significant excess of GSTM1 null individuals
among cases of colorectal cancer: 56.1% compared with the control group
value of 41.8%. More than 70% of individuals with a tumor in the
proximal colon were GSTM1 null.

Chen et al. (1996) described a method for simultaneous characterization
of GSTM1 and GSTT1 (600436) and studied the genotypes in whites and
blacks. The frequency of the null genotype for GSTM1 (GSTM1-) was higher
in whites and that for GSTT1- was higher in blacks. The observed
frequency of the 'double null' genotype was not significantly different
from that predicted, assuming that the 2 polymorphisms are independent
and did not differ by race or sex.

McLellan et al. (1997) found that 2 Saudi Arabian individuals with
ultrarapid GSTM1 enzyme activity were heterozygous for a tandem GSTM1
gene duplication. They suggested that the duplication was generated as
the reciprocal product of the homologous unequal crossing-over event
that produces the null allele.

The formation of DNA and protein adducts by environmental pollutants is
modulated by host polymorphisms in genes that encode metabolizing
enzymes. In a study of 67 smokers, Godschalk et al. (2001) studied
aromatic-DNA adduct levels in relation to polymorphisms in GSTM1, GSTT1,
and NAT1 (108345) and NAT2 (612182). Adjusted for the amount of
cigarettes smoked per day, DNA adduct levels were higher in GSTM1 null
individuals than in GSTM1+ subjects; higher in NAT1 slow acetylators
than in NAT1 fast acetylators; and associated with the NAT2 acetylator
status for slow or fast acetylators. Highest DNA adduct levels were
observed in slow acetylators for both NAT1 and NAT2 who also lacked the
GSTM1 gene, and lowest in GSTM1+ subjects with the fast acetylator
genotype for both NAT1 and NAT2. The results showed the combined effects
of genetic polymorphisms at these 4 loci and indicated that, due to the
complex carcinogen exposure, simultaneous assessment of multiple
genotypes may identify individuals at higher cancer risk.

Patients with reduced ability to metabolize environmental carcinogens or
toxins may be at risk of developing aplastic anemia. GST has been
implicated in detoxifying mutagenic electrophilic compounds. Lee et al.
(2001) investigated whether homozygous deletions of GSTM1 and GSTT1
affect the likelihood of developing aplastic anemia. They found that the
incidence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletions was significantly higher for
aplastic anemia patients than for healthy controls (odds ratio = 3.1, p
= 0.01, and odds ratio = 3.1, p = 0.004, respectively). Among the
aplastic anemia patients, 17.5% had chromosomal abnormalities at the
time of diagnosis, and all aplastic anemia patients with chromosomal
abnormalities showed GSTT1 gene deletions.

Carless et al. (2002) examined the role of GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 (134660),
and GSTZ1 (603758) gene polymorphisms in susceptibility to solar
keratoses development. Using DNA samples from volunteers involved in the
Nambour Skin Cancer Prevention Trial, allele and genotype frequencies
were determined. No significant differences were detected in GSTP1 or
GSTZ1 allele or genotype frequencies; however, a significant association
between GSTM1 genotypes and solar keratoses development was detected,
with null individuals having an approximate 2-fold increase in risk for
solar keratoses development and a significantly higher increase in risk
in conjunction with high outdoor exposure. Also, a difference in GSTT1
genotype frequencies was detected, although considering that multiple
testing was undertaken, this was found not to be significant. Fair skin
and inability to tan were found to be highly significant risk factors
for solar keratoses development, with odds ratios of 18.5 (CI, 5.7-59.9)
and 7.4 (CI, 2.6-21.0), respectively. Overall, GSTM1 conferred a
significant increase in risk of solar keratoses development,
particularly in the presence of high outdoor exposure and
synergistically with phenotypic risk factors of fair skin and inability
to tan.

Lohmueller et al. (2003) performed a metaanalysis of 301 published
genetic association studies covering 25 different reported associations.
For 8 of the associations, pooled analysis of follow-up studies yielded
statistically significant replication of the first report, with modest
estimated genetic effects. One of these 8 associations was that between
GSTM1 and head/neck cancer (275355), as first reported by Trizna et al.
(1995). Head/neck cancer showed association with homozygosity for a null
allele of the GSTM1 gene.

Verlaan et al. (2003) investigated whether polymorphisms in the GSTM1,
GSTT1, and GSTP1 genes modified the risk for chronic pancreatitis
(167800). DNA was studied from 142 adult chronic pancreatitis patients
with alcoholic (79 patients), hereditary (21 patients), or idiopathic
(42 patients) origin. The rates of GSTT1 and GSTP1 genotypes did not
differ between chronic pancreatitis patients and healthy controls;
however, GSTM1 null alleles were significantly less common in alcoholic
chronic pancreatitis patients (odds ratio = 0.56) as compared to healthy
controls and to alcoholic controls. The frequency of the GSTM1 null
genotype was significantly lower in alcoholic chronic pancreatitis
patients, especially young female patients. Thus it appears that GSTM1
null alcohol users are less susceptible to chronic pancreatitis. The
molecular change leading to the GSTM1 null phenotype is a partial gene
deletion. It is associated with complete absence of GSTM1 enzyme
activity. The frequency of the GSTM1 null genotype ranges from 23 to 62%
in different populations around the world and is approximately 50% in
Caucasians, as reviewed by Cotton et al. (2000).

Gilliland et al. (2004) found that GSTM1 and GSTP1 modify the adjuvant
effect of diesel exhaust particles on allergic inflammation. They
challenged ragweed-sensitive patients intranasally with allergen alone
and with allergen plus diesel exhaust particles, and found that
individuals with GSTM1 null or GSTP1 ile105 wildtype genotypes showed
significant increases in IgE and histamine after challenge with diesel
exhaust particles and allergens; the increase was largest in patients
with both the GSTM1 null and GSTP1 ile/ile genotypes.

French et al. (2005) genotyped 126 children with newly diagnosed acute
lymphoblastic leukemia at 16 well-characterized functional
polymorphisms. The GSTM1 null polymorphism was a significant predictor
of global gene expression, dividing patients based on their germline
genotypes. Genes whose expression distinguished the null genotype from
the non-null genotype included NBS1 (602667) and PRKR (176871). Although
GSTM1 expression is concentrated in liver, it is involved in the
conjugation (and thus transport, excretion, and lipophilicity) of a
broad range of endobiotics and xenobiotics, which French et al. (2005)
suggested could plausibly have consequences for gene expression in
different tissues.

Observational studies have provided consistent evidence for a protective
role of vegetable consumption against lung cancer, with the evidence
being most apparent for green cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli
and cabbage. Such vegetables are rich is isothiocyanates, which have
been shown in animals to have strong chemopreventative properties
against lung cancer (Hecht, 1996). In studies of the effect of
cruciferous vegetables, a definite protective effect against any type of
cancer is hard to identify, in view of the small size of studies and
potential for confounding from other dietary sources. Brennan et al.
(2005) addressed the problem of confounding by adopting a mendelian
randomization approach. Isothiocyanates are thought to be eliminated by
glutathione-S-transferase enzymes, most notably GSTM1 and GSTT1
(600430). Both GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes have null alleles with homozygous
null phenotypes, resulting in no enzyme being produced. Individuals who
are homozygous for the inactive form of either or both genes probably
have higher isothiocyanate concentrations because of their reduced
elimination capacity. Furthermore, and implicit in the mendelian
randomization approach, the roles of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes are likely to
be independent of other dietary or lifestyle factors. To investigate the
role of cruciferous vegetable consumption in the prevention of lung
cancer in interaction with GST genotypes, Brennan et al. (2005)
investigated this relation in a case-control study of 2,141 cases and
2,168 controls in 6 countries of central and eastern Europe, a region
that has traditionally high rates of cruciferous vegetable consumption.
Weekly consumption of cruciferous vegetables protected against lung
cancer in those who were GSTM1-null (odds ratio = 0.67), GSTT1-null
(odds ratio = 0.63), or both (odds ratio = 0.28). No protective effect
was seen in people who were both GSTM1- and GSTT1-positive. Similar
protective results were noted for consumption of cabbage and a
combination of broccoli and brussels sprouts.

Through a genomewide association study, Huang et al. (2009) identified a
significant association between dbSNP rs366631, a single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) approximately 11 kb downstream of the GSTM1 gene, and
GSTM1 expression. Utilizing lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from
International HapMap Consortium CEU and YRI populations, the authors
determined that the dbSNP rs366631 SNP is a nonpolymorphic site. The
false genotyping call arose from sequence homology, a common GSTM1
region deletion, and a non-specific genotyping platform used to identify
the SNP. However, the HapMap call for dbSNP rs366631 genotype is an
indicator of GSTM1 upstream region deletion. Furthermore, this upstream
deletion can be used as a marker of GSTM1 gene deletion. More than 75%
of the Caucasian (CEU) samples exhibited GSTM1 deletion, and none
contained 2 copies of GSTM1. In contrast, up to 25% of African (YRI)
samples were found to have 2 copies of GSTM1. The authors concluded that
dbSNP rs366631 is a pseudo-SNP that can be used as a GSTM1 deletion
marker.

HISTORY

Scott and Wright (1980) found that the amount of GST of red cells, while
homogeneous on electrophoresis, varies more than 6-fold among
individuals. Family studies showed no correlation of levels in husbands
and wives but a strong correlation between the level in children and the
mean level of their parents. They could devise no way to use this enzyme
as a genetic marker.

DeJong et al. (1991) stated that the H(a) or A genes encode the alpha
class proteins, and the H(b) or B genes encode the mu class proteins.
They concluded that the H(b) genes of GST are located on 3 separate
chromosomes: 1, 6, and 13. They suggested that a polymorphic mu GST gene
is probably located on chromosome 13. They suggested further that this
may be a presence/absence polymorphism of a gene created through
retrotransposition.

162096	TITLE *162096 MIDKINE; MDK
;;MIDGESTATION AND KIDNEY; MK;;
NEURITE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR 2, FORMERLY; NEGF2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Midkine is a retinoic acid-responsive, heparin-binding growth factor
expressed in various cell types during embryogenesis. It promotes
angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell migration. Midkine is also expressed
in several carcinomas, suggesting that it may play a role in
tumorigenesis, perhaps through its effects on angiogenesis (summary by
Reynolds et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using mouse Mk to screen a midgestation human embryonic kidney cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta genomic library, Tsutsui et
al. (1991) cloned human MDK, which they called MK. The deduced 121-amino
acid protein has a signal sequence and shares 87% identity with mouse
Mk. Orthologs of MK were detected in rat, cow, and chicken. The chicken
ortholog, Rihb, is a retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein. MK
shares about 50% amino acid homology with the human heparin-binding
protein pleiotrophin (PTN; 162095), with highest conservation in the
central part of the molecule and complete conservation of cysteine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1 kb in
adult human kidney and PA1 human teratocarcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Reynolds et al. (2004) found that hypoxia induced midkine expression in
alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vasculature in a strain of mice
sensitive to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced expression of both HIF1-alpha
(603348) and midkine in human placental adenocarcinoma, mouse fetal lung
mesenchyme, and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines. HIF1-alpha
induced midkine expression via regulatory elements in the mouse midkine
promoter. Chronic expression of midkine during embryonic development in
transgenic mice resulted in pulmonary arterial remodeling and
muscularization, but only during the postnatal phase of lung
development. In fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells and transgenic mice,
midkine upregulated expression of myocardin (MYOCD; 606127), a regulator
of smooth muscle cell differentiation.

Intraperitoneal adhesions between organs or between organs and
peritoneal walls occur in more than 90% of cases involving major
abdominal operations. Using a model of postoperative adhesions and
Mk-null mice, Inoh et al. (2004) showed that midkine was fundamentally
involved in the formation of intraperitoneal adhesions, at least partly
by promoting migration of macrophages and neutrophils to the omentum.

Hobo et al. (2009) found that 5/6 nephrectomy in mice, a model of
chronic kidney disease, induced expression of midkine in lung, leading
to elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) activity and
plasma angiotensin II (106150) levels and subsequent hypertension.
Exposure to midkine enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human
lung microvascular endothelial cells. Oxidative stress may have
contributed to midkine expression, since 5/6 nephrectomy induced
expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1; 300225), Nox2 (CYBB; 300481),
and Nox4 (605261). Furthermore, an antioxidant reduced midkine
expression and plasma angiotensin II levels and ameliorated hypertension
in 5/6 nephrectomized mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Uehara et al. (1992) determined that the MDK gene contains 4 exons. The
5-prime flanking region adjacent to the start site contains 5 GC boxes,
a steroid/thyroid hormone receptor-binding site, and an A/T-rich island,
but there is no obvious CAAT box. Further upstream there is a region
with high GC content. The mouse Mdk gene has a similar organization,
with conservation of exons and significant homology in the 5-prime
region adjacent to the start site. There are 3 additional regions of
homology between mouse and human MDK in the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Eddy et al. (1991) demonstrated that
the MDK gene segregates concordantly with chromosome 11 and, using cell
hybrids carrying translocations involving chromosome 11, they mapped the
gene regionally to 11p13-p11. Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the MDK gene
to human chromosome 11p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Simon-Chazottes et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Mdk gene to chromosome 2,
using an interspecific backcross panel and microsatellite polymorphisms
as markers. O'Hara et al. (1995) used somatic cell hybrid analysis and
interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, to map human Mdk to
chromosome 11p13-p11 and mouse Mdk to a syntenic region of mouse
chromosome 2. They also mapped an Mdk pseudogene to mouse chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using microarray analysis, Ezquerra et al. (2005) found that aortae of
Mk -/- mice showed elevated expression of renin (REN; 179820),
angiotensinogen (106150), angiotensin II receptor-1 (AGTR1; 106165), and
angiotensin II receptor-2 (AGTR2; 300034) and decreased expression of
Ace.

symbolized S100A13, a calcium-binding protein belonging to the S100
protein family. S100 proteins are small EF-hand calcium-binding proteins
of variable lengths and sequence identities. At least 12 of 15 members
of the family are clustered on chromosome 1q21 (see S100A1; 176940);
S100A13 likewise colocalizes with S100A1 on the 1q21 cluster. The
predicted 98 amino acid S100A13 protein shows sequence homologies to
other S100 proteins between 50.5% (S100A5; 176991) and 59.3% (S100A12;
603112). Northern blot analysis showed high amounts of S100A13 mRNA in
adult skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, ovary, spleen, small intestine,
and pancreas and in fetal lung, heart, cochlea, liver, spleen, and
parathyroid tumor cells. Moderate levels were detected in all other
tissues examined, with the exception of placenta and leukocytes, which
had very low or undetectable levels. Wicki et al. (1996) also cloned the
mouse S100A13 gene. Mouse S100A13 is composed of 98 amino acids and
displays 86.7% homology compared to human S100A13.

102574	TITLE +102574 ACTININ, ALPHA-3; ACTN3
ACTN3 DEFICIENCY, INCLUDED;;
SPRINTING PERFORMANCE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Alpha-actinin is an actin-binding protein with multiple roles in
different cell types. In nonmuscle cells, the cytoskeletal isoform is
found along microfilament bundles and adherens-type junctions, where it
is involved in binding actin to the membrane (see ACTN1; 102575). In
contrast, skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle isoforms are localized to
the Z disc and analogous dense bodies, where they help anchor the
myofibrillar actin filaments. Beggs et al. (1992) characterized 2 human
muscle-specific alpha-actinin genes, ACTN2 (102573) and ACTN3. The
deduced 901-amino acid ACTN3 protein has a calculated molecular mass of
about 103 kD. ACTN3 has an N-terminal actin-binding domain of about 250
amino acids, followed by 4 central repeats and 2 EF-hand motifs near the
C terminus. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues detected Actn3
expression in skeletal muscle, but not in heart, brain, liver, kidney,
or small intestine. ACTN3 was also detected in human fetal skeletal
muscle.

Seto et al. (2011) stated that the central repeats of ACTN3 are spectrin
(see 182860)-like repeats that form a rod domain.

MAPPING

Beggs et al. (1992) assigned the ACTN3 gene to human chromosome 11 by
use of somatic cell hybrids and narrowed the localization to chromosome
11q13-q14 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Mills et al. (2001) mapped the 4 murine actinin orthologs, which were
all located at evolutionarily conserved syntenic regions for the 4 human
genes.

GENE FUNCTION

Mills et al. (2001) demonstrated that murine Actn2 and Actn3 are
differentially expressed, spatially and temporally, during embryonic
development and that, in contrast to humans, alpha-actinin-2 expression
does not completely overlap alpha-actinin-3 in postnatal skeletal
muscle, suggesting independent function. Furthermore, sequence
comparison of human, mouse, and chicken alpha-actinin genes demonstrated
that ACTN3 has been conserved over a long period of evolutionary time,
implying a constraint on evolutionary rate imposed by continued function
of the gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

ACTN2 is expressed in all skeletal muscle fibers, whereas
alpha-actinin-3 expression is limited to a subset of type 2 (fast)
fibers. North et al. (1999) identified a common nonsense mutation in
ACTN3, arg577-to-ter (R577X; 102574.0001; dbSNP rs1815739), in the
general population in many ethnic groups. The R577X mutation had an
allele frequency ranging from 0.22 +/- 0.05 to 0.52 +/- 0.04 in ethnic
populations from Asia, the Americas, Australasia, Africa, and Europe.
Approximately 16% of the world population is predicted to have
congenital deficiency of alpha-actinin-3. No disease phenotype is
associated with this deficiency. North et al. (1999) concluded that
other factors likely compensate for the absence of alpha-actinin-3 at
the Z lines of skeletal muscle fast fibers. These results demonstrated
that ACTN3 is not an essential gene, and suggested that absence of a
structural protein caused by homozygosity for a null mutation cannot be
assumed to be disease-related without additional family and population
data.

Yang et al. (2003) demonstrated highly significant associations between
ACTN3 genotype and athletic performance. Both male and female elite
sprint athletes had significantly higher frequencies of the 577R allele
than did controls. This suggested that the presence of alpha-actinin-3
has a beneficial effect on the function of skeletal muscle in generating
forceful contractions at high velocity, and provides an evolutionary
advantage because of increased sprint performance. There is also a
genotype effect in female sprint and endurance athletes, with higher
than expected numbers of R577X heterozygotes among sprint athletes and
lower than expected numbers among endurance athletes. The lack of a
similar effect in males suggested that the ACTN3 genotype affects
athletic performance differently in males and females. The differential
effects in sprint and endurance athletes suggested that the R577X
polymorphism may have been maintained in the human population by
balancing natural selection. It is likely that there is a 'trade off'
between sprint and endurance traits that imposes important constraints
on the evolution of physical performance in humans and other vertebrates
(Garland et al., 1990). This hypothesis is supported by data from
world-class decathletes, which demonstrated that performance in the
100-meter sprint, shot put, long jump, and 110-meter hurdles (which rely
on explosive power and fast fatigue-susceptible muscle fibers) is
negatively correlated with performance in the 1,500-meter race (which
requires endurance and fatigue-resistant slow fiber activity) (Van Damme
et al., 2002).

ANIMAL MODEL

MacArthur et al. (2008) found that muscle from Actn3-knockout mice
displayed reduced force generation, reduced fast fiber diameter,
increased activity of multiple enzymes in the aerobic metabolic pathway,
altered contractile properties, and enhanced recovery from fatigue.
MacArthur et al. (2008) concluded that null mutation of ACTN3, such as
R577X, shifts the properties of fast fibers toward those characteristic
of slow fibers.

Quinlan et al. (2010) demonstrated a link between alpha-actinin-3 and
glycogen metabolism. Actn3 knockout mice had higher muscle glycogen
content and a 50% reduction in the activity of glycogen phosphorylase,
GPh (PYGM; 608455). The reduction in enzyme activity was accompanied by
altered posttranslational modification of GPh, suggesting that
alpha-actinin-3 may regulate GPh activity by altering its level of
phosphorylation. Quinlan et al. (2010) proposed that the changes in
glycogen metabolism underlie the downstream metabolic consequences of
alpha-actinin-3 deficiency.

Seto et al. (2011) found that, compared with wildtype, Actn3 -/- mouse
extensor digitorum longus muscle generated significantly reduced force
and was susceptible to contraction-induced damage during eccentric
contraction when stretched 30% above optimal length. Damage in Actn3 -/-
muscle was accompanied by upregulation of genes involved in muscle
regeneration. Expression of Actn2 was upregulated in Actn3 -/- muscle
such that the total sarcomeric content of alpha-actinin was unchanged.
The Z-disc proteins Zasp (LDB3; 605906), titin (TTN; 188840), and
vinculin (VCL; 193065) bound more avidly to Actn2 than to Actn3,
suggesting a biochemical basis for altered mechanics and fragility in
Actn3 -/- muscle.

ACTN3, ARG577TER (dbSNP rs1815739)

North et al. (1999) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1747
(dbSNP rs1815739) in exon 16 of the ACTN3 gene, which resulted in a stop
codon replacing the arg at residue 577 (R577X). This mutation resulted
in no protein detectable by Western blot. Sixteen percent of the world
population is predicted to be homozygous for this mutation. No disease
phenotype is associated; therefore, North et al. (1999) suggested that
the ACTN3 gene is functionally redundant in humans.

Mills et al. (2001) genotyped nonhuman primates and concluded that the
R577X null mutation most likely arose in humans.

Suminaga et al. (2000) found an allele frequency of 0.49 for the 1747C-T
polymorphism in Japanese. Although the incidence (24.2%) of congenital
deficiency of alpha-actinin-3 was high, no evidence could be found that
the homozygous state modified the dystrophinopathies Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (310200) and Becker muscular dystrophy (300376).

Yang et al. (2003) found that the R577X genotype is associated with
human elite athletic performance. Both male and female elite sprint
athletes had significantly higher frequencies of the 577R allele than
did controls. In female sprint and endurance athletes there was a higher
than expected number of R577X heterozygotes among sprint athletes and
lower than expected numbers among endurance athletes. The lack of a
similar effect in males suggested that the ACTN3 genotype affects
athletic performance differently in males and females. The differential
effects in sprint and endurance athletes suggested that the R577X
polymorphism may have been maintained in the human population by
balancing natural selection.

Niemi and Majamaa (2005) determined the ACTN3 R577X genotype in 52 elite
Finnish endurance and 89 sprint athletes and found that the frequency of
the XX genotype was higher and RR lower among the endurance athletes,
and that none of the top Finnish sprinters had the XX genotype.

The association of the R577X polymorphism with elite athlete status and
human muscle performance suggests that ACTN3 deficiency influences the
function of fast muscle fibers. MacArthur et al. (2007) showed that loss
of ACTN3 expression in a knockout mouse model resulted in a shift in
muscle metabolism toward the more efficient aerobic pathway and an
increase in intrinsic endurance performance. In addition, they
demonstrated that the genomic region surrounding the 577X null allele
shows low levels of genetic variation and recombination in individuals
of European and East Asian descent, consistent with strong, recent
positive selection. They proposed that the 577X allele has been
positively selected in some human populations owing to its effect on
skeletal muscle metabolism.

In a study of 992 Greek adolescent boys and girls, Moran et al. (2007)
found a significant association between the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism and
40 meter sprint times in males (p = 0.003) that accounts for 2.3% of
phenotypic variance, with the 577R allele contributing to faster times
in an additive fashion. The R577X polymorphism was not associated with
other predominantly strength/power-related or endurance phenotypes.

In 52 white and 23 black elite-level bodybuilders and powerlifters from
the U.S., Roth et al. (2008) found significantly lower XX genotype
frequency in strength athletes (6.7%) compared to controls (16.3%; p =
0.005). The XX genotype was significantly lower in white athletes (9.7%)
compared to white controls (19.9%; p = 0.018), but did not reach
significance in black athletes (0%) compared to black controls (4.8%; p
= 0.10). Roth et al. (2008) concluded that the 577X allele is
underrepresented in elite strength athletes in addition to sprint
athletes, consistent with previous reports indicating that ACTN3
deficiency appears to impair muscle performance.

;;PROTEIN INCORPORATED LATER INTO TIGHT JUNCTIONS; PILT;;
TIGHT JUNCTION PROTEIN 4; TJP4
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse 11-day-old embryo library using
human DLG2 (603583) SH3 and GK domains as bait, Kawabe et al. (2001)
cloned mouse Tjap1, which they called Pilt. By database analysis, they
identified full-length human TJAP1, which encodes a 547-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60.7 kD. TJAP1 contains an
N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a central proline-rich region, and
shares 74% amino acid identity with its mouse homolog. TJAP1 shares 43%
and 51% amino acid identity over its N-terminal and C-terminal regions,
respectively, with the same regions of BEGAIN. SDS-PAGE detected TJAP1
as an 86-kD band. Northern blot analysis detected an approximately
3.0-kb transcript in all 16 human tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence microscopy of mouse mammary tumor cells, Kawabe et
al. (2001) localized TJAP1 to cell-cell junctions where it colocalized
with ZO-1 (TJP1; 601009) at tight junctions. Using endogenous and stably
expressed TJAP1, the authors confirmed colocalization of TJAP1 and ZO-1
to tight junctions in small intestine cells where TJAP1 localized to the
Golgi complex. TJAP1 was absent from apical junctions and desmosomes. By
observing TJAP1 incorporation into cell-cell junctions over time in a
mouse wound healing model, the authors showed that TJAP1 was
incorporated into tight junctions at the very late stages of cell-cell
junction formation. Kawabe et al. (2001) used GST pull-down assays to
confirm that TJAP1 binds DLG2. Immunohistochemical studies using
cadherin deficient L-cells expressing claudin-1 (CLDN1; 603718) or JAM
(JAM1; 605721) showed no evidence of interaction between TJAP1 and
either of these 2 proteins.

606887	TITLE *606887 SULFITE OXIDASE; SUOX
DESCRIPTION Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) is the terminal enzyme in the oxidative
degradation pathway of sulfur-containing amino acids.

CLONING

Garrett et al. (1995) isolated a 2.4-kb cDNA clone of human sulfite
oxidase from a human liver cDNA library. The deduced 488-amino acid
protein has a molecular mass of approximately 52 kD and shows 88%
homology to the rat protein and 67% homology to the chicken protein.
Comparison of 3 sulfite oxidase sequences to several plant and fungal
nitrate reductase sequences revealed a single conserved cysteine with
highly conserved flanking sequences. Garrett et al. (1995) postulated
that the conserved cysteine is a ligand of molybdenum in sulfite oxidase
and nitrate reductase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Kisker et al. (1997) determined the crystal structure of chicken liver
sulfite oxidase, which is homologous to the human protein, at
1.9-angstrom resolution. They found that each monomer of the dimeric
enzyme consists of 3 domains. At the active site, the Mo is
penta-coordinated by 3 sulfur ligands, 1 oxo group, and 1 water/hydroxo.
A sulfate molecule adjacent to the Mo identifies the substrate binding
pocket.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the sulfite
oxidase gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP sts-AA026389).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Kisker et al. (1997) characterized 4 missense mutations in the SUOX gene
(606887.0001-606887.0004) in cell lines from patients with isolated
sulfite oxidase deficiency (272300). The crystallographic results
predicted that 2 of these mutations (arg160 to gln, 606887.0001 and
ala208 to asp, 606887.0002) are near the sulfate-binding site, whereas
the other mutations (ser370 to tyr, 606887.0003 and gly473 to asp,
606887.0004) occur within the domain mediating dimerization.

Johnson et al. (2002) identified 12 novel mutations in the SUOX gene in
patients with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency. These included 2
frameshift mutations, 2 homozygous nonsense mutations, and 8 missense
mutations.

Seidahmed et al. (2005) identified a 1-bp deletion in the SUOX gene
(606887.0005) in a male infant with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SULFITE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY, ISOLATED
SUOX, ARG160GLN

In a cell line from a patient with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency
(272300), Kisker et al. (1997) found a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide
479 of the cDNA of liver sulfite oxidase, resulting in an arg-to-gln
substitution at amino acid residue 160 (R160Q).

The R160Q mutation was identified by Garrett et al. (1998) in a
5-year-old girl with sulfite oxidase deficiency born of first-cousin
parents of Dutch descent. Recombinant protein containing the R160Q
mutation, expressed in Escherichia coli, contained its full complement
of molybdenum and heme, but exhibited 2% of native activity under
standard assay conditions. Absorption spectroscopy of the isolated
molybdenum domains of native sulfite oxidase and of the R160Q mutant
showed significant differences in the 480- and 350-nm absorption bands,
suggestive of altered geometry at the molybdenum center. Other studies
led to the proposal that under normal circumstances arg160 attracts the
anionic substrate sulfite to the binding site near the molybdenum.

SULFITE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY, ISOLATED
SUOX, ALA208ASP

In a cell line from a patient with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency
(272300), Kisker et al. (1997) found a C-to-A substitution at nucleotide
623 of the cDNA of liver sulfite oxidase, resulting in an ala-to-asp
substitution at amino acid 208.

In a cell line from a patient with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency
(272300), Kisker et al. (1997) found a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide
1109 of the cDNA of liver sulfite oxidase, resulting in a ser-to-tyr
substitution at amino acid 370.

.0004
SULFITE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY, ISOLATED
SUOX, GLY473ASP

In a cell line from a patient with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency
(272300), Kisker et al. (1997) found a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide
1418 of the cDNA of liver sulfite oxidase, resulting in a gly-to-asp
substitution at amino acid 473.

.0005
SULFITE OXIDASE DEFICIENCY, ISOLATED
SUOX, 1-BP DEL, 1244G

In a male infant with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (272300) from
a consanguineous Arab family, Seidahmed et al. (2005) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion (1244delG) in the SUOX gene, predicting
a frameshift at amino acid 117 and resulting in a mutant protein of only
128 amino acids with total truncation of the molybdopterin and
dimerizing domains. The parents and 1 unaffected sib were heterozygous
for the deletion.

142461	TITLE *142461 HEPARAN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN OF BASEMENT MEMBRANE; HSPG2
;;PERLECAN; PLC
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heparan sulfate proteoglycan is a major component of basement membranes,
where the molecule may be involved in the stabilization of other
molecules as well as being involved with glomerular permeability to
macromolecules and cell adhesion. This form of HSPG, known as HSPG2 or
perlecan, is encoded by a gene that maps to chromosome 1. The gene for
the form of HSPG associated with the cell surface of fibroblasts has
been mapped to human chromosome 8 (142460).

CLONING

Wintle et al. (1990) isolated 2 partial cDNA clones encoding different
domains of the core protein of mouse HSPG. Southern blot analysis
suggested that the gene is in single copy in the mouse; presumably, the
same is true for the human. Dodge et al. (1991) studied 2 overlapping
cDNA clones of HSPG2 from a human colon library. The deduced amino acid
sequence showed an identity of 87% between human and mouse. Cohen et al.
(1993) stated that perlecan is an approximately 467-kD protein comprised
of 5 domains, of which only the first, the heparan sulfate-binding
region, is unique. The other 4 domains are homologous to the LDL
receptor, the N-terminal region of laminin A and B short arms (see
600133), NCAM (116930), and the globular C terminus of the laminin A
chain, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Iozzo et al. (1997) found that perlecan transcription is upregulated by
TGF-beta (190180).

Perlecan, a ubiquitous heparan sulfate proteoglycan, possesses
angiogenic and growth-promoting attributes primarily by acting as a
coreceptor for basic fibroblast growth factor, FGF2 (134920). Sharma et
al. (1998) blocked perlecan expression by using either constitutive
CMV-driven or doxycycline-inducible antisense constructs. Growth of
colon carcinoma cells was markedly attenuated upon obliteration of
perlecan gene expression and these effects correlated with reduced
responsiveness to and affinity for mitogenic keratinocyte growth factor,
FGF7 (148180). Exogenous perlecan effectively reconstituted the activity
of FGF7 in the perlecan-deficient cells. In both tumor xenografts
induced by human colon carcinoma cells and tumor allografts induced by
highly invasive mouse melanoma cells, perlecan suppression caused
substantial inhibition of tumor growth and neovascularization. Thus,
perlecan is a potent inducer of tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo,
and therapeutic interventions targeting this key modulator of tumor
progression may improve cancer treatment.

By yeast 2-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses with domain III of
HSPG2 as bait, Mongiat et al. (2001) showed that keratinocyte FGFBP1
(607737) interacts with HSPG2. Deletion analysis determined that FGFBP1
binds to the second EGF motif of domain III, close to the binding site
for FGF7. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated colocalization of
FGFBP1 with HSPG2 in the pericellular stroma of squamous cell
carcinomas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cohen et al. (1993) reported that the HSPG2 gene is composed of 94 exons
spanning at least 120 kb, and that there appear to be multiple
transcription start sites.

Iozzo et al. (1997) characterized the promoter region of HSPG2.

Nicole et al. (2000) found that the HSPG2 gene contains 97 exons.

MAPPING

Using a mouse cDNA clone for in situ hybridization, Wintle et al. (1990)
assigned the HSPG2 gene to human chromosome 1p36.1. Dodge et al. (1991)
demonstrated by Southern blot analyses of DNA from human/rodent somatic
cell hybrids, including subclones with specific translocations or
spontaneous breaks of human chromosome 1, that the HSPG2 gene lies on
the telomeric part of 1p. By a combination of somatic cell hybrid
analysis and in situ hybridization, Kallunki et al. (1991) assigned the
HSPG2 gene to 1p36.1-p35. Chakravarti et al. (1991) mapped the gene to
mouse chromosome 4 by segregation analysis of restriction fragment
length variants (RFLVs) in recombinant inbred strains of mice. They
referred to the gene as perlecan (Plc).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome Type 1

Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1 (SJS1; 255800) is a rare autosomal
recessive disorder characterized by permanent myotonia and skeletal
dysplasia, resulting in reduced stature, kyphoscoliosis, bowing of the
diaphyses, and irregular epiphyses. In 3 families with SJS1, Nicole et
al. (2000) identified mutations in the HSPG2 gene (see, e.g.,
142461.0001; 142461.0002). The findings underscored the importance of
perlecan not only in maintaining cartilage integrity but also in
regulating muscle excitability. Perlecan is present in endomysium, the
connective tissue sheath surrounding individual skeletal muscle fibers,
whereas most myotonic disorders arise from mutations in genes encoding
voltage-gated ion channels. A possible explanation for muscle
hyperexcitability with perlecan mutations could involve the modulation
of ion-channel expression or function through their interaction with
perlecan.

Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2002) identified 5 different mutations in the
perlecan gene in 3 unrelated patients with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome
(142461.0006-142461.0010). Heterozygous mutations in 2 patients with SJS
(who were genetically compound heterozygotes) either produced truncated
perlecan that lacked domain V or resulted in significantly reduced
levels of wildtype perlecan. A third patient was homozygous for a 7-bp
deletion that resulted in reduced amounts of nearly full-length
perlecan. The SJS mutations resulted in reduced levels of different
forms of perlecan that were secreted to the extracellular matrix and
were likely partially functional. These findings suggested that perlecan
has an important role in neuromuscular function and cartilage formation.

Stum et al. (2006) identified 25 different HSPG2 mutations, including 22
novel mutations, distributed throughout the gene among 35 patients from
23 families with SJS1. Analysis of HSPG2 mRNA and perlecan
immunostaining in patients' fibroblasts showed a hypomorphic,
loss-of-function effect. Truncating mutations resulted in
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, whereas missense mutations involving
cysteine residues led to intracellular retention of perlecan. No founder
mutations were identified and no genotype/phenotype correlations were
observed.

- Dyssegmental Dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker Type

In patients with the Silverman-Handmaker type of dyssegmental dysplasia
(DDSH; 224410), Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2001) found homozygous
duplication and heterozygous point mutations in the HSPG2 gene
(142461.0003-142461.0005), all predicted to cause a frameshift,
resulting in a truncated protein core. Truncated perlecan was not
secreted by patient fibroblasts, but was degraded to smaller fragments
within the cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (1999) disrupted the Hspg2 gene in mice.
Approximately 40% of Hspg2 -/- mice died at embryonic day 10.5 with
defective cephalic development. The remaining Hspg2 -/- mice died just
after birth with skeletal dysplasia characterized by micromelia with
broad and bowed long bones, narrow thorax, and craniofacial
abnormalities. only 6% of Hspg2 -/- mice developed both exencephaly and
chondrodysplasia. Hspg2 -/- cartilage showed severe disorganization of
the columnar structures of chondrocytes and defective endochondral
ossification. Hspg2 -/- cartilage matrix contained reduced and
disorganized collagen fibrils and glycosaminoglycans, suggesting that
perlecan has an important role in matrix structure. In Hspg2 -/-
cartilage, proliferation of chondrocytes was reduced and the
prehypertrophic zone was diminished. The abnormal phenotypes of the
Hspg2 -/- skeleton are similar to those of thanatophoric dysplasia type
1 (see 187600), which is caused by activating mutations in FGFR3
(134934), and to those of FGFR3 gain-of-function mice. Arikawa-Hirasawa
et al. (1999) concluded that these molecules affect similar signaling
pathways.

Rodgers et al. (2007) generated 2 strains of knock-in mice: those
carrying the C1532Y mutation (142461.0002) alone and those carrying the
C1532Y mutation and the neomycin cassette (C1532Yneo). Analysis of
C1532Yneo mice revealed Hspg2 transcriptional changes, leading to
reduced perlecan secretion and a skeletal phenotype reminiscent of
Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS; 255800) with features including smaller
size, impaired mineralization, misshapen bones, flat face, and
osteoarthritis- and osteonecrosis-like joint dysplasias. C1532Yneo mice
also displayed transient expansion of hypertrophic cartilage in the
growth plate, concomitant with radial trabecular bone orientation. In
contrast, the mice carrying only the C1532Y mutation displayed a mild
phenotype inconsistent with SJS. Rodgers et al. (2007) questioned the
C1532Y mutation as the sole causative factor for SJS in the Turkish
family harboring this variant (Nicole et al., 2000), and suggested that
transcriptional changes leading to perlecan reduction might represent
the disease mechanism for SJS.

Stum et al. (2008) performed a similar study of 2 mouse strains, 1 with
the homozygous C1532Y mutation and 1 with the mutation attached to a
neomycin cassette (C1532Yneo), to test a dosage effect of the mutation.
Skeletal muscle sections from both mouse strains showed a reduced
extracellular network, more severe in the C1532Yneo mice, as well as
intracellular accumulation of the mutant protein. Both strains had
reduced body weight, more apparent in the C1532Yneo mice, and C1532Yneo
mutant mice developed chondrodysplasia and hip dysplasia. Both strains
also developed a progressive neuromuscular phenotype from age 2 months,
with delayed opening of the eyelids and stiffening of the hindlimbs when
suspended by the tail. However, the phenotype was more severe in the
C1532Yneo mice, who also showed spontaneous muscle activity on
electromyography (EMG). The difference in phenotype was consistent with
a dosage effect, with an inverse correlation between severity and amount
of perlecan secreted into the basement membrane. Skeletal muscle biopsy
of C1532Yneo mice showed variability in fiber size and centralized
nuclei, but no evidence of acute muscle degeneration/regeneration. The
muscles of C1532Y mutant mice were not affected. Skeletal muscle samples
from both mouse strains showed a specific loss of collagen-tailed
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (COLQ; 603033), more severe in C1532Yneo
mice, and apparently due to a decrease in the amount of perlecan at the
neuromuscular junction. EMG studies of the limb muscles indicated that
the endplate AChE deficiency resulted in the potentiation of muscle
force, with a prolonged decay time of endplate potentials. However,
physiologic endplate AChE deficiency was not associated with spontaneous
activity at rest in the diaphragm, suggesting that additional changes
are necessary to cause this activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, IVS64DS, A-G, +4

In affected members of a Tunisian family with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome
(255800), Nicole et al. (2000) identified a homozygous A-to-G transition
at position +4 of the intron 64 splice donor site of the HSPG2 gene. The
resulting loss of exon 64 in the mRNA introduced a frameshift and a
subsequent premature stop codon, predicted to result in a truncated
protein lacking 1,595 amino acids.

.0002
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, CYS1532TYR

In a Turkish family with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (255800), Nicole et
al. (2000) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 4595 of the
HSPG2 gene, resulting in a cys1532-to-tyr substitution.

Rodgers et al. (2007) analyzed the C1532Y mutation in 2 strains of
knock-in mice: those carrying the C1532Y mutation alone and those
carrying the mutation and the neomycin cassette (C1532Yneo). C1532Yneo
mice displayed a phenotype reminiscent of SJS syndrome, including
smaller size, impaired mineralization, misshapen bones, flat face, and
osteoarthritis- and osteonecrosis-like joint dysplasias, whereas the
mice carrying only the C1532Y mutation displayed a mild phenotype
inconsistent with SJS. Rodgers et al. (2007) questioned the C1532Y
mutation as the sole causative factor for SJS in the Turkish family
harboring the variant, and suggested that transcriptional changes
leading to perlecan reduction might represent the disease mechanism for
SJS.

.0003
DYSSEGMENTAL DYSPLASIA, SILVERMAN-HANDMAKER TYPE
HSPG2, 89-BP DUP, EX34

In a pair of sibs with the Silverman-Handmaker type of dyssegmental
dysplasia (224410), born to consanguineous parents of Sri Lankan origin,
Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2001) identified an 89-bp duplication in exon
34 of the HSPG2 gene in homozygosity. The cartilage matrix from these
patients stained poorly with antibody specific for perlecan, but there
was staining of intracellular inclusion bodies. Truncated perlecan was
not secreted by patient fibroblasts, but was degraded to smaller
fragments within the cells.

.0004
DYSSEGMENTAL DYSPLASIA, SILVERMAN-HANDMAKER TYPE
HSPG2, 7086G-A, +5

In a 22-week fetus diagnosed with the Silverman-Handmaker type of
dyssegmental dysplasia (DDSH; 224410), Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2001)
identified a G-to-A transition at the +5 position of intron 52 of the
HSPG2 gene (7086+5G-A), which resulted in skipping of exon 52 and a
premature termination codon in exon 53. The fetus manifested
exophthalmos, bilateral cataracts, pterygia, posterior encephalocele,
and microcephaly, with a crown-heel length of 18 cm and a crown-rump
length of 16 cm. The radiographs and chondroosseous morphology were
typical of DDSH. On the other allele, the patient had skipping of exon
73 and a premature termination codon in exon 75 (142461.0005).

.0005
DYSSEGMENTAL DYSPLASIA, SILVERMAN-HANDMAKER TYPE
HSPG2, 10328C-T

In a fetus with Silverman-Handmaker type of dyssegmental dysplasia
(224410), Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2001) identified a C-to-T transition
at residue 10,328 of exon 73 of the HSPG2 gene (10328C-T), which
resulted in skipping of exon 73 and a premature termination codon in
exon 75. The patient was a compound heterozygote for another splice site
mutation resulting in a premature termination codon (142461.0004).

.0006
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, IVS56DS, A-G, +4

Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2002) found compound heterozygosity for 2 HSPG2
mutations in an 8-year-old boy with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (255800).
At the age of 3 years, dysmorphic features were noted that became
gradually prominent and consisted of tonic contraction of the facial
muscles, micrognathia, low-set ears with folded helices, medial
displacement of the outer canthi, narrow palpebral fissures,
blepharophimosis, microstomia and pursing of the lips, high-arched
palate, cervical kyphosis, pes planus and valgus ankle formation, bowing
of the leg bones, kyphoscoliosis, and lumbar lordosis. He had
hypertrophic muscles and mild weakness of the quadriceps muscles. The
creatine kinase level was elevated and the EMG showed occasional
myotonic discharges. One allele in the patient had an A-to-G transition
at +4 position (donor site) of intron 56 of the HSPG2 gene (7374+4A-G)
that resulted in skipping of exon 56. The other allele contained a
fusion of exons 60 and 61 that resulted in retention of intron 59 or
intron 61 or in retention of both in the mutant transcripts
(142461.0007).

.0007
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, EX60/61 FUS

In an 8-year-old boy with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (255800),
Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2002) found compound heterozygosity for a
splice site mutation (142461.0006) and, on the second allele, a fusion
of exons 60 and 61 that resulted in retention of intron 59 or intron 61
or in retention of both in the mutant transcripts. The exon fusion
occurred at the precise acceptor and donor sites, probably by
retrotransposition. The exon fusion mutation created aberrant
transcripts. The production of wildtype transcript was also predicted
and confirmed.

.0008
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, 8544G-A

Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2002) found compound heterozygosity for 2
different mutations in the HSPG2 gene in a male with Schwartz-Jampel
syndrome (255800). Short stature and micromelia had been noted at the
age of 4 months. Radiographs showed squared, flared ilia and short,
bowed long bones. At 3 years of age, he showed thigh muscle hypertrophy
and gastrocnemius muscle atrophy. Micrognathia, pursed lips, saddle
nose, orbital hypertelorism, low-set ears, and high-arched palate were
noted. He showed a waddling gait, mild weakness of the quadriceps
muscles, and percussion myotonia. EMG showed myotonic and myopathic
discharges. He was found to have a G-to-A transition at the last
nucleotide of exon 64 (8544G-A) in allele 1. This transition mutation
did not change an amino acid but resulted in skipping of exon 64. The
second allele carried a 9-bp deletion at the acceptor junction of intron
66 and exon 67 that created abnormal splicing, including total or
partial retention of intron 66 or skipping of exon 67 (142461.0009). All
aberrant splicing products were predicted to create premature
termination codons.

.0009
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, 9-BP DEL

See 142461.0008 and Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2002).

.0010
SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME, TYPE 1
HSPG2, 7,108-BP DEL

Arikawa-Hirasawa et al. (2002) identified a 7-kb homozygous deletion in
the HSPG2 gene in a patient who had been reported as having micromelic
chondrodysplasia by Stevenson (1982) but was reclassified as having
Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (255800) by Spranger et al. (2000).
Micrognathia, prominent philtrum, and bowed long bones were noted at age
3 months. Radiographs showed coronal clefts in the lumbar vertebrae,
deficient ossification in the dorsal vertebrae, and squared, flared
ilia. All long bones showed expansion of the metaphyses. At 4 years of
age, facial movement became difficult because of stiffness, and the
mouth opening was restricted. EMG showed pseudomyotonic discharges and
rapid firing of single units in multiple muscles. The 7,108-bp
homozygous deletion began at the 5-prime portion of exon 96 and extended
well beyond the 3-prime flanking sequence of HSPG2. The deletion created
2 aberrant transcripts: product 2, derived from intron 95 retention, and
product 1, resulting from failure of splicing of both introns 94 and 95,
predicted to produce truncated proteins missing approximately 35 and
approximately 64 amino acids from the C-terminal portion, respectively.

DESCRIPTION See GAGE1 (300594) for more information about the GAGE gene cluster.

CLONING

Human melanoma cells express several distinct antigens that are
recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs). One class of
these antigens is encoded by genes, such as MAGE1 (MAGEA1; 300016),
MAGE3 (MAGEA3; 300174), and BAGE (605167), that are expressed in a large
fraction of tumors of various histologic types but are silent in normal
adult tissues, except for testis. Van den Eynde et al. (1995) identified
GAGE1 as a gene encoding an antigen that is present on melanoma MZ2-MEL
cells and is recognized by autologous CTLs. By screening a melanoma
MZ2-MEL cDNA library with a GAGE1 cDNA, they isolated cDNAs representing
5 genes with sequence similarity to GAGE1. They named the genes GAGE2,
GAGE3 (300596), GAGE4 (300597), GAGE5 (300598), and GAGE6 (300599). The
GAGE2 to -6 cDNAs differ mainly by single nucleotide substitutions that
are scattered throughout the sequence. The deduced GAGE2 protein has 116
amino acids. The authors defined the antigenic peptide encoded by GAGE1
and found that GAGE2 also encodes it. RT-PCR using primers common to
GAGE1 to -6 found no expression of these genes in any normal adult
tissue tested except testis. RT-PCR using primers specific to both GAGE1
and GAGE2 found that at least 1 of these genes was expressed in 25% of
sarcomas, 24% of melanomas, 19% of nonsmall cell lung carcinomas, 19% of
head and neck tumors, and 12% of bladder tumors; GAGE1 and GAGE2 were
not expressed in colorectal carcinomas and renal cell carcinomas.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gjerstorff and Ditzel (2008) stated that the GAGE2C gene is contained
within a 9.5-kb GAGE repeat. It contains 5 exons that span about 6.3 kb,
and it has a LINE insertion that disrupts 1 exon compared with GAGE1.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, De Backer et al. (1999) mapped
the GAGE2C gene to chromosome Xp11.4-p11.2.

By genomic sequence analysis, Gjerstorff and Ditzel (2008) mapped the
GAGE2C gene to a GAGE gene cluster on chromosome Xp11.23.

;;ONCOGENE ERBB3;;
TYROSINE KINASE-TYPE CELL SURFACE RECEPTOR HER3; HER3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kraus et al. (1989) detected a DNA fragment related to but distinct from
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 131550) and ERBB2 (164870). cDNA
cloning showed a predicted 148-kD transmembrane polypeptide with
structural features identifying it as a member of the ERBB gene family,
prompting the designation ERBB3. Markedly elevated ERBB3 mRNA levels
were demonstrated in certain human mammary tumor cell lines, suggesting
that it may play a role in some human malignancies just as does EGFR
(also called ERBB1).

GENE FUNCTION

Epidermal growth factor (131530), transforming growth factor alpha
(190170), and amphiregulin (104640) are structurally and functionally
related growth regulatory proteins. They all are secreted polypeptides
that bind to the 170-kD cell-surface EGF receptor, activating its
intrinsic kinase activity. Plowman et al. (1990) speculated that these 3
proteins may differentially interact with a homolog of EGFR. They failed
to show any interaction between these 3 secreted growth factors and
ERBB2, a known EGFR-related protein. Searching for other members of this
family of receptor tyrosine kinases, however, they cloned and studied
the expression of ERBB3, which they referred to as HER3. The cDNA was
isolated from a human carcinoma cell line, and its 6-kb transcript was
identified in various human tissues.

Carraway et al. (1994) demonstrated that ERBB3 is a receptor for
heregulin (NRG1; 142445) and is capable of mediating HGL-stimulated
tyrosine phosphorylation of itself.

Memon et al. (2004) used real-time PCR to quantify expression of NRG1,
NRG2 (603818), NRG3 (605533), and NRG4 (610894) and their receptors HER3
and HER4 (ERBB4; 600543) in biopsies from 88 bladder cancer patients.
They detected NRG4 expression in 91% of bladder cancer cases, with
significantly lower expression in biopsies of superficial invasive
tumors in comparison to superficial tumors, indicating early loss of
NRG4 expression during bladder cancer progression. NRG4 downregulation
was strongly correlated with stage, grade, and type of tumor. Increased
expression of HER3, HER4, and NRG4 correlated to better survival.
Coexpression of HER3 and HER4 with NRG4 showed even better correlation
with survival (p = 0.0034 and p = 0.0080, respectively).

Jones et al. (2006) used microarrays comprising virtually every Src
homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain encoded in the
human genome to measure the equilibrium dissociation constant of each
domain for 61 peptides representing physiologic sites of tyrosine
phosphorylation on the 4 ErbB receptors. By slicing through the network
at different affinity thresholds, Jones et al. (2006) found surprising
differences between the receptors. Most notably, EGFR and ErbB2 became
markedly more promiscuous as the threshold was lowered, whereas ErbB3
did not. Because EGFR and ErbB2 are overexpressed in many human cancers,
Jones et al. (2006) concluded that the extent to which promiscuity
changes with protein concentration may contribute to the oncogenic
potential of receptor tyrosine kinases.

In lung cancer specimens that had developed resistance to gefitinib,
Engelman et al. (2007) found that amplification of MET (164860) caused
gefitinib resistance by driving ERBB3-dependent activation of
phosphoinositide 3-kinase, a pathway thought to be specific to EGFR/ERBB
family receptors. Thus, Engelman et al. (2007) proposed that MET
amplification may promote drug resistance in other ERBB-driven cancers
as well.

Early social isolation results in adult behavioral and cognitive
dysfunction that correlates with white matter alterations. Makinodan et
al. (2012) showed that mice isolated for 2 weeks immediately after
weaning have alterations in prefrontal cortex function and myelination
that do not recover with reintroduction into a social environment. These
alterations, which occur only during this critical period, are
phenocopied by loss of oligodendrocyte ErbB3 receptors, and social
isolation leads to reduced expression of the ErbB3 ligand neuregulin-1
(142445). Makinodan et al. (2012) concluded that social experience
regulates prefrontal cortex myelination through neuregulin-1/ErbB3
signaling and that this is essential for normal cognitive function, thus
providing a cellular and molecular context to understand the
consequences of social isolation.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Cho and Leahy (2002) determined the 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of
the entire extracellular region of human HER3. The structure consists of
4 domains with structural homology to domains found in the type I
insulin-like growth factor receptor (147370). The HER3 structure
revealed a contact between domains II and IV that constrains the
relative orientations of ligand-binding domains and provides a
structural basis for understanding both multiple-affinity forms of EGFRs
and conformational changes induced in the receptor by ligand binding
during signaling.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization, Kraus et al. (1989) mapped the ERBB3 gene to
chromosome 12q13.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lethal congenital contracture syndrome type 2 (LCCS2; 607598), a
neonatally lethal form of arthrogryposis, originally described in 2
Israeli Bedouin kindreds, is characterized by multiple joint
contractures, anterior horn atrophy in the spinal cord, and a unique
feature of markedly distended urinary bladder. Narkis et al. (2007)
showed that the disorder is caused by aberrant splicing of ERBB3, which
leads to a predicted truncated protein. ERBB3, an activator of the
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway, which regulates cell survival
and vesicle trafficking, is essential for the generation of precursors
of Schwann cells that normally accompany peripheral axons of motor
neurons. Gain-of-function mutations in members of the epidermal growth
factor tyrosine kinase receptor family are associated with predilection
to cancer; see ERBB2 (164870). This was the first report of a human
phenotype resulting from loss of function of a member of this group. The
human disorder is reminiscent of the phenotype of the null mutant of
this mouse ortholog. Most Erbb3-knockout embryos die before birth,
without Schwann cell precursors and Schwann cells that normally
accompany peripheral axons of sensory and motor neurons.

The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007) reported an
association between dbSNP rs2292239 in the ERBB3 gene and type 1
diabetes (222100) (p = 1.49 x 10(-9); OR, 1.30). In a study of 4,000
individuals with type 1 diabetes, 5,000 controls, and 2,997 family trios
independent of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007) study,
Todd et al. (2007) confirmed the previously reported association of
dbSNP rs2292239 (p = 3.83 x 10(-16); combined with WTCCC p = 1.52 x
10(-20)).

Barrett et al. (2009) reported the findings of a genomewide association
study of type 1 diabetes, combined in a metaanalysis with 2 previously
published studies (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007; Cooper
et al., 2008). The total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045
reference samples. Using an analysis that combined comparisons over the
3 studies, they confirmed several previously reported associations,
including dbSNP rs2292239 at 12q13.2 (P = 2.2 x 10(-25)).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LETHAL CONGENITAL CONTRACTURE SYNDROME 2
ERBB3, IVS10, A-G, -8

In all affected members of a large Israeli Bedouin family with lethal
congenital contracture syndrome type 2 (LCCS2; 607598), and in an
affected individual from another family, Narkis et al. (2007) found a
homozygous A-to-G substitution 8 basepairs 5-prime of exon 11 of the
ERBB3 gene (IVS10-8A-G). The mutation caused an insertion of 8 basepairs
between exons 10 and 11 and resulted in frameshift and premature
termination, generating a 399-amino acid protein instead of the native
1,341 amino acids.

KOX2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated immature myeloid
cell line cDNA library, Nomura et al. (1994) cloned ZNF33A, which they
designated KIAA0065. The transcript has an Alu element in its 3-prime
UTR. The deduced 848-amino acid protein contains a C2H2-type zinc finger
domain and shares 93.1% identity with ZNF11B (ZNF33B; 194522) over 374
amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected ZNF33A expression in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in skeletal muscle, and lowest
expression in testis and colon.

Using ZAK (609479) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a heart cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library and 5-prime RACE,
Yang (2003) cloned ZNF33A, which they designated ZZAPK. The deduced
810-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 94.3 kD. ZZAPK
contains an N-terminal KRAB domain, followed by a 256-amino acid linker
region and 16 tandemly repeated Kruppel-type zinc fingers at its C
terminus. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of a major
5.5-kb transcript in all tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of cotransfected human embryonic kidney (HEK293)
cells, Yang (2003) confirmed direct interaction between epitope-tagged
ZZAPK and ZAK. Mutation analysis indicated that the SAM domain of ZAK
was required to bind ZZAPK. By coexpression in a rat fibroblast cell
line, Yang (2003) determined that ZZAPK countered the effect of ZAK on
G2/M cell cycle arrest. When expressed alone, ZZAPK increased entry of
cells into S phase. ZZAPK increased expression of cyclin E (CCNE1;
123837) in rat fibroblasts and HEK293 cells. ZZAPK also increased
expression of transcription factor E2F (see 189971) and the activity of
an E2F-dependent reporter gene.

MAPPING

By a combination of in situ chromosomal hybridization and somatic cell
hybrid analysis, Rousseau-Merck et al. (1992) concluded that there are
sequences hybridizing to the KOX2 probe at 2 loci, which they called
ZNF11A (ZNF33A) and ZNF11B (ZNF33B), that map proximal and distal to a
10q11.2 breakpoint, respectively. They suggested that the 2 ZNF11 loci
represent related sequences. Rousseau-Merck et al. (1992) suggested that
this cluster of zinc finger protein genes (ZNF11, ZNF22 (194529), and
ZNF25 (194528)) is of particular interest since the loci for MEN2A and
MEN2B map to this region.

Tunnacliffe et al. (1993) identified 2 related zinc finger gene clusters
mapping to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10. Cluster A
contains ZNF11A (ZNF33A) and ZNF37A and maps to chromosome 10p11.2.
Cluster B contains ZNF11B (ZNF33B) and ZNF37B and maps to chromosome
10q11.2. Southern blot analysis indicated that the 2 clusters evolved by
duplication of an ancestral gene cluster before the divergence of the
human and great ape lineages.

;;ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 1q; AF1Q
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Tse et al. (1995) identified the AF1Q (MLLT11) gene as the translocation
partner of the MLL gene in 2 infants with acute myelomonocytic leukemia
and t(1;11)(q21;q23). In one of the patients, the derivative chromosome
11 represented an in-frame fusion of the N-terminal portion of the MLL
gene to the complete AF1Q open reading frame, whereas the derivative
chromosome 1 did not give rise to an open reading frame. This
observation suggested that the N-terminal portion of the MLL gene is
critical for leukemogenesis in translocations involving band 11q23.

Using a repeat-free chromosome 1 probe, Tse et al. (1995) isolated the
AF1Q cDNA from a human fibroblast cDNA library. The deduced AF1Q protein
contains 90 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 9 kD. AF1Q
was found to be highly expressed in the thymus but not in peripheral
lymphoid tissues. In contrast to its restricted distribution in normal
hematopoietic tissue, AF1Q was expressed in all leukemic cell lines
tested.

MAPPING

The MLLT11 gene maps to chromosome 1q21 (Tse et al., 1995).

;;DIS3-LIKE EXONUCLEASE 1; DIS3L1;;
KIAA1955
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The RNA exosome is an approximately 400-kD multimeric ribonucleolytic
complex that participates in both endonucleolytic and 3-prime/5-prime
exonucleolytic activity in RNA processing and in the degradation of a
variety of RNA substrates. DIS3L is a catalytic subunit that has
3-prime/5-prime exonucleolytic activity (summary by Tomecki et al.,
2010).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned DIS3L, which they designated
KIAA1955. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
end, and the deduced 947-amino acid protein shares 36% identity with
DIS3 (607533). RT-PCR ELISA detected highest expression in skeletal
muscle. Moderate to high expression was detected in all other adult and
fetal tissues and specific adult brain regions examined.

By searching a human EST database for sequences similar to yeast Dis3,
Tomecki et al. (2010) identified DIS3L. The deduced 1,000-amino acid
protein contains a weak N-terminal PIN-like domain, followed by 2
cold-shock domains, an RNB exonuclease catalytic domain, and a
C-terminal S1 domain. DIS3L localized predominantly to the cytoplasm in
HEK293 and HeLa cells, with exclusion from nucleoli.

By analyzing peptides associated with exosome complexes immunoaffinity
purified from HeLa cells, followed by database analysis and PCR analysis
of a teratocarcinoma cDNA library, Staals et al. (2010) cloned
full-length DIS3L, which they designated DIS3L1. The deduced 1,054-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 120.8 kD. It has a
poorly conserved N-terminal PIN domain, followed by 2 cold-shock
domains, a putative RNase II-type RNB exonuclease catalytic domain, and
a possible C-terminal S1 RNA-binding domain. Database analysis revealed
3 additional DIS3L1 splice variants. Fluorescence- and epitope-tagged
DIS3L1 and endogenous DIS3L1 localized to the cytoplasm of transfected
human HEP-2 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Staals et al. (2010) confirmed that fluorescence- or epitope-tagged
DIS3L1 coprecipitated with RRP4 (EXOSC2; 602238) and other exosome
components. Immunopurified DIS3L1 showed Mg(2+)-dependent
exoribonuclease activity and converted substrate RNA into nucleotide
monophosphates. It has no endonuclease activity. Blocking of the 3-prime
end impaired degradation, consistent with 3-prime/5-prime
exoribonuclease activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of
DIS3L1 reduced exoribonuclease activity from immunopurified exosomes.
Mutation of asp486 within the RNB domain of DIS3L1 abrogated its
ribonuclease activity and resulted in the accumulation of truncated 28S
rRNA fragments.

Tomecki et al. (2010) found that epitope-tagged human DIS3 or DIS3L
coimmunoprecipitated with core exosome subunits from transfected HEK293
cells. Depletion of DIS3L from HeLa cells had no effect on accumulation
of nuclear RNAs, but it contributed to the stabilization of cytoplasmic
MYC (190080) induced by knockdown of DIS3. DIS3L purified from
transfected HEK293 cells showed 3-prime/5-prime exonuclease activity
against single stranded RNA, but showed no endonuclease activity against
a circular RNA substrate. Domain analysis revealed that the RNB domains
of DIS3L conferred exonuclease activity.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DIS3L gene to chromosome 15q22.31 based on an
alignment of the DIS3L sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB075835) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607185	TITLE *607185 SEC24-RELATED GENE FAMILY, MEMBER C; SEC24C
;;KIAA0079
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

In yeast, the Sec23-Sec24 complex is a component of coat protein II
(COPII; see 601924)-coated vesicles that mediate protein transport from
the endoplasmic reticulum. SEC24C is 1 of several mammalian proteins
that show structural and functional homology to yeast Sec24.

CLONING

Nomura et al. (1994) cloned SEC24C, which they called KIAA0079, from a
human immature myeloid cell line cDNA library. The deduced 1,125-amino
acid protein contains a crystallin-beta (see 123610)/gamma (see 123660)
'Greek key' motif and a glycosyl hydrolase motif. Northern blot analysis
revealed ubiquitous expression.

Tani et al. (1999) characterized KIAA0079 and noted its homology with
yeast Sec24. By Northern blot analysis, they confirmed ubiquitous
expression of a 4.4-kb transcript. SDS/PAGE of bovine brain Sec24c
indicated an apparent molecular mass of 120 kD.

Tang et al. (1999) determined that SEC24A (607183) and SEC24B (607184)
share about 56% sequence identity, while SEC24C and SEC24D (607186)
share about 52% identity. However, the identity shared between these 2
pairs is only about 20%. When expressed in COS cells, both SEC24C and
SEC24D showed cytoplasmic staining and staining of perinuclear vesicular
structures. The perinuclear membrane-associated staining for both also
colocalized well with that of SEC13 (see 600152).

By transient expression of SEC24C in green monkey kidney cells, Tani et
al. (1999) found that, when expressed at low levels, SEC24C localized in
structures scattered throughout the cytoplasm and in more central
reticular structures, with significant colocalization with a cis-Golgi
marker, beta-COP (600959).

Using expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells, Pagano et al. (1999)
confirmed that the intracellular distribution of SEC24C colocalizes with
SEC13, and that both show punctate cytoplasmic and perinuclear
distribution. RNase protection assays demonstrated that SEC24A, SEC24B,
and SEC24C were expressed simultaneously in several cell lines,
including lines originating from fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and
lymphocytes. The major difference in expression was a constant 2- to
3-fold lower level of expression of SEC24B compared with SEC24A and
SEC24C.

GENE FUNCTION

Tani et al. (1999) found that, when overexpressed in green monkey kidney
cells, SEC24C caused a defect in protein export from the endoplasmic
reticulum. Gel filtration and Western blot analyses of bovine brain
cytosol showed that Sec24c coeluted with mammalian Sec23 at a position
corresponding to an apparent molecular of 300 to 400 kD. The authors
confirmed an interaction between the proteins by in vitro pull-down
assays. By mutation analysis, they identified the interacting domains as
the C terminus of Sec24c and the N terminus of Sec23.

By gel filtration analysis, Pagano et al. (1999) determined that SEC24C
and SEC24B elute in the same fractions, corresponding to a molecular
mass of 400 kD. However, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed no
evidence for direct interaction between SEC24C and SEC24B, although both
coimmunoprecipitated with SEC23A. Pagano et al. (1999) confirmed the
interaction between SEC24C and SEC23A by yeast 2-hybrid assays. The
interacting domain of SEC24C included amino acids 485 and 807,
containing the conserved SEC24 family domain. Within SEC23A, the
interacting domain included the N terminus up to amino acid 543.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis, Nomura et al. (1994) mapped the SEC24C
gene to chromosome 10.

108731	TITLE *108731 ATPase, Ca(2+)-TRANSPORTING, PLASMA MEMBRANE, 1; ATP2B1
;;PLASMA MEMBRANE Ca(2+)-ATPase, TYPE 1; PMCA1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Ca(2+)-ATPases are a family of plasma membrane pumps encoded by at
least 4 genes: ATP2B1; ATP2B2 (108733) on chromosome 3p26; ATP2B3
(300014) on Xq28; and ATP2B4 (108732) on 1q25. The diversity of these
enzymes is further increased by alternative splicing of transcripts.

CLONING

Verma et al. (1988) isolated a cDNA corresponding to a Ca(2+) plasma
membrane pump from a human teratoma cDNA library. The 1,220-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of 134.6 kD. The translated
sequence contains a putative calmodulin-binding domain near the C
terminus and domains matching those of cAMP-dependent protein kinase
substrates.

Kumar et al. (1993) isolated a cDNA corresponding to the ATP2B1 gene
from a human osteoblast cDNA library. The cDNA encoded a deduced
1,220-amino acid protein.

Brandt et al. (1992) described 4 PMCA1 splice variants, which they
referred to as PMCA1a through PMCA1d, and examined their expression
using PCR. PMCA1a was expressed in spinal cord, brain, skeletal muscle,
and heart. PMCA1b was expressed in all tissues examined. PMCA1c was
expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, spinal cord, and brain. PMCA1d was
expressed in heart and skeletal muscle.

By RT-PCR, Santiago-Garcia et al. (1996) found variable expression of
the PMCA and SERCA (see 108730) genes during human fetal heart
development. PMCA1 and PMCA4 (ATP2B4) were expressed in 8-, 12-, and
20-week fetal heart and in adult heart.

Okunade et al. (2004) examined Pmca1 and Pmca4 expression in mouse
tissues. Pmca1 was expressed in all tissues examined, and Pmca4 was
expressed in all tissues examined except liver. Pmca1 predominated in
brain, intestine, kidney, lung, and stomach, whereas Pmca4 predominated
in aorta, portal vein, bladder, diaphragm, seminal vesicles, and testis.

GENE FUNCTION

The Ca(2+)-ATPases are members of the P class of ion-motive ATPases;
they form an acylphosphate intermediate as part of the reaction
mechanism. PMCA removes bivalent calcium ions from eukaryotic cells and
plays a critical role in intracellular calcium homeostasis by its
capacity for removing calcium ions from cells against very large
concentration gradients (Olson et al., 1991).

Mammalian PMCA1 is expressed in calcium-transporting epithelia and bone
mesenchymal cells, and it is upregulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in
both tissues. Glendenning et al. (2000) presented evidence showing
tissue-specific sensitivity of the PMCA1 promoter to direct
transcriptional downregulation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Their
results suggested that any positive regulatory vitamin D response
element in PMCA1 must lie outside the core promoter.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hilfiker et al. (1993) determined that the PMCA1 gene contains 22 exons
and a putative alternative exon 1 that they called exon 1*. The ATG
start codon is in exon 2. The promoter and 5-prime flanking region is
embedded in a CpG island and is characterized by numerous Sp1
(189906)-binding sites and the absence of a TATA box. The PMCA1 gene
spans more than 100 kb.

MAPPING

Olson et al. (1991) mapped the ATP2B1 gene to chromosome 12q21-q23 by 3
independent methods: Southern analysis of human-rodent somatic cell
hybrids, in situ hybridization of human metaphase spreads, and genetic
linkage analysis in the CEPH pedigrees.

ANIMAL MODEL

Okunade et al. (2004) found that loss of both copies of the Atp2b1 gene
caused embryonic lethality in mice, whereas heterozygous mutants had no
overt phenotype.

612971	TITLE *612971 PDZ DOMAIN-CONTAINING 7; PDZD7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Schneider et al. (2009) used positional cloning to identify the PDZD7
gene from junction fragments of a reciprocal t(10;11) translocation.
They identified 4 PDZD7 isoforms; isoforms A and B contain 2 PDZ
domains, and the shorter isoforms C and D contain no PDZ domains and 1
PDZ domain, respectively. RT-PCR analysis detected PDZD7 expression in
human cortex with weak expression in the human inner ear.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schneider et al. (2009) reported that PDZD7 consists of 16 exons
spanning 23.3 kb and results in 4 different transcripts. The A and B
isoforms are encoded by exons 2 to 8 or 9, and the C and D isoforms are
encoded by exons 6 to 13 and exons 13 to 16, respectively.

MAPPING

By positional cloning, Schneider et al. (2009) mapped the PDZD7 gene to
chromosome 10q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

By GST pull-down assay and Western blot analysis, Schneider et al.
(2009) showed that PDZD7 interacted with SANS (USH1G; 607696) in HEK293T
cells. GST pull-down assay in mouse retina showed that PDZD7 also
interacted with harmonin (USH1C; 605242).

Ebermann et al. (2010) performed a yeast 2-hybrid screen of human fetal
brain and observed interaction of the PDZ2 domain of PDZD7 with the
C-terminal intracellular domain of GPR98 (602851), including its
PDZ-binding motif. Coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed the
interaction and revealed that it is mediated by the PDZ2 domain of PDZD7
and the PDZ-binding motif of GPR98. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation
studies demonstrated interaction of the first and second PDZ domains of
PDZD7 with USH2A (608400); a truncated version of USH2A without the
C-terminal PDZ-binding motif showed reduced interaction.

CYTOGENETICS

In a boy with nonsyndromic congenital sensorineural hearing impairment,
born of consanguineous parents, Schneider et al. (2009) identified a
homozygous reciprocal 46,XY t(10;11),t(10;11) translocation. Examination
did not show any signs of retinitis pigmentosa or vestibular dysfunction
at age 8 years. Both parents and their 4 other children were
heterozygous translocation carriers. FISH analysis localized the
breakpoints to chromosome 10q24.3 in intron 10 of the PDZD7 gene and to
chromosome 11q23.3 in close proximity (less than 5 Mb) to 2 other
nonsyndromic deafness genes, RDX (179410) and TECTA (602574). The
10q24.3 breakpoint would disrupt the open reading frame of the C and D
isoforms of PDZD7. Schneider et al. (2009) suggested that the PDZD7 gene
can cause nonsyndromic autosomal recessive deafness and is also a prime
candidate gene for Usher syndrome (see 276900).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Modifier of Retinal Disease in Usher Syndrome Type IIA

In 2 French Canadian sisters with USH2A (276901), Ebermann et al. (2010)
analyzed the PDZD7 gene and identified heterozygosity for a de novo
frameshift mutation (612971.0001) in 1 of the sisters, who had
earlier-onset and more severe retinal disease. The authors concluded
that PDZD7 is a retinal disease modifier in patients with USH2A.

- Usher Syndrome Type IIC, GPR98/PDZD7 Digenic

In a 51-year-old German man with type II Usher syndrome (see USH2C,
605472) who was negative for mutation in the Usher syndrome genes USH2A
(608400), WHRN (607928), and CLRN1 (606397), Ebermann et al. (2010)
identified a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the GPR98 gene
(602851.0010) and a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the PDZD7 gene
(612971.0002). No second mutant allele was detected in GPR98 or PDZD7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ebermann et al. (2010) characterized pdzd7 in zebrafish and identified 2
orthologs, pdzd7a and pdzd7b, which were expressed in retinal cells and
mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear. Functional studies of the
ortholog with higher expression, pdzd7a, demonstrated localization in
the connecting cilium region of photoreceptors as well as in the apical
region of hair cells in the inner ear and neuromasts in young fish.
Strong pdzd7a localization at the ciliary base as well as more diffuse
labeling of photoreceptor outer segments persisted in adult retinas,
indicating postdevelopmental function. Morpholino knockdown of pdzd7a
produced Usher-like symptoms that had previously been described in
zebrafish Usher gene mutations, including circling, reduced startle
reflex, and disorganized stereocilia. Half-strength morpholino knockdown
produced no impairment of balance or retinal cell survival when used
alone, whereas combined partial pdzd7a;gpr98 knockdown produced
Usher-like circling and retinal degeneration. In addition, no Usher-like
phenotype was observed in combined partial pdzd7a;ush2a knockdown.
However, knockdowns of either ush2a or pdzd7a alone produced similar
moderate levels of photoreceptor cell death, and this degeneration
increased dramatically when embryos were treated with a full dose of
ush2a morpholino combined with a half dose of pdzd7a morpholino. The
cell death observed in these retinas was restricted to the
photoreceptors, and the retinas were otherwise morphologically normal.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RETINAL DISEASE IN USHER SYNDROME TYPE IIA, MODIFIER OF
PDZD7, 1-BP INS, 166C

Ebermann et al. (2010) analyzed the PDZD7 gene in 2 French Canadian
sisters with USH2A (276901) who were homozygous for a frameshift
mutation in the USH2A gene (608400.0003), and identified heterozygosity
for an additional de novo 1-bp insertion (166insC) in the PDZD7 gene in
1 of the sisters, who had earlier-onset and more severe retinal disease.
The PDZD7 mutation was not present in the less-affected sister or in 254
controls.

.0002
USHER SYNDROME, TYPE IIC, GPR98/PDZD7 DIGENIC
PDZD7, 9-BP INS, NT2194

In a 51-year-old German man with Usher syndrome (see USH2C; 605472),
Ebermann et al. (2010) identified a heterozygous 9-bp deletion
(2194_2203del) in the PDZD7 gene and a heterozygous frameshift mutation
in the GPR98 gene (602851.0010). No second mutant allele was detected in
GPR98 or PDZD7. His unaffected sister was heterozygous for the PDZD7
mutation but did not carry the GPR98 mutation; the PDZD7 mutation was
not found in 405 controls.

601989	TITLE *601989 S100 CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN A13; S100A13
DESCRIPTION Wicki et al. (1996) reported the characterization of a human gene they
symbolized S100A13, a calcium-binding protein belonging to the S100
protein family. S100 proteins are small EF-hand calcium-binding proteins
of variable lengths and sequence identities. At least 12 of 15 members
of the family are clustered on chromosome 1q21 (see S100A1; 176940);
S100A13 likewise colocalizes with S100A1 on the 1q21 cluster. The
predicted 98 amino acid S100A13 protein shows sequence homologies to
other S100 proteins between 50.5% (S100A5; 176991) and 59.3% (S100A12;
603112). Northern blot analysis showed high amounts of S100A13 mRNA in
adult skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, ovary, spleen, small intestine,
and pancreas and in fetal lung, heart, cochlea, liver, spleen, and
parathyroid tumor cells. Moderate levels were detected in all other
tissues examined, with the exception of placenta and leukocytes, which
had very low or undetectable levels. Wicki et al. (1996) also cloned the
mouse S100A13 gene. Mouse S100A13 is composed of 98 amino acids and
displays 86.7% homology compared to human S100A13.

602891	TITLE *602891 KILLER CELL LECTIN-LIKE RECEPTOR, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 2; KLRC2
;;NKG2C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Houchins et al. (1991) reported the cDNA sequences of a series of
related transcripts that are expressed primarily in natural killer (NK)
cells. This group of genes, designated NKG2, encodes a family of C-type
lectins. See NKG2A, 161555. By Northern blot analysis, Yabe et al.
(1993) found that 1 gene, NKG2C, was expressed as 3 transcripts, 1.1- to
1.6-kb in size, in NK cell lines and in 1 of the T-cell lines tested.

The protein HLA-E (143010) is a nonclassical MHC molecule of limited
sequence variability. Its expression on the cell surface is regulated by
the binding of peptides derived from the signal sequence of some other
MHC class I molecules. Braud et al. (1998) reported the identification
of ligands for HLA-E. Braud et al. (1998) constructed tetramers in which
recombinant HLA-E and beta-2 microglobulin were refolded with an MHC
leader-sequence peptide, biotinylated, and conjugated to Extravidin.
This HLA-E tetramer bound to natural killer (NK) cells and a small
subset of T cells from peripheral blood. On transfectants, the tetramer
bound to the CD94/NKG2A, CD94/NKG2B, and CD94/NKG2C NK cell receptors,
but did not bind to the immunoglobulin family of NK cell receptors
(KIRs; see 604936). Surface expression of HLA-E was enough to protect
target cells from lysis by CD94/NKG2A+ NK cell clones. A subset of HLA
class I alleles had been shown to inhibit killing by CD94/NKG2A+ NK cell
clones. Only the HLA alleles that possess a leader peptide capable of
upregulating HLA-E surface expression confer resistance to NK
cell-mediated lysis, implying that their action is mediated by HLA-E,
the predominant ligand for the NK cell inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A.

GENE STRUCTURE

Glienke et al. (1998) determined that the NKG2C, NKG2E (602892), and
NKG2F (602893) genes are highly similar except for variability at their
3-prime ends. The NKG2C gene contains 6 exons, whereas NKG2E has 7 exons
and NKG2F has only 4 exons.

MAPPING

By analysis of a cosmid contig, Plougastel and Trowsdale (1998) found
that the NKG2C gene and other members of the NKG2 gene family are
clustered within 350 kb on 12p13.2-p12.3, a region known as the NK
complex.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) and the related neuropeptide AF (NPAF) were
originally isolated from bovine brain using an antibody against the
molluscan peptide FMRF-NH2. NPFF has been detected in human serum. In
rat, these FMRF-amide-related peptides have been shown to have
wide-ranging physiologic effects, including the modulation of
morphine-induced analgesia, elevation of arterial blood pressure, and
increased somatostatin secretion from the pancreas. By searching a human
EST database, Perry et al. (1997) identified epididymis ESTs encoding
sequences that are homologous to the bovine FMRF-amide-related peptides.
Using these ESTs to screen a human testis cDNA library, they isolated a
full-length cDNA encoding the precursor of both NPFF and NPAF; the
authors called this precursor the 'FMRF-amide-like peptide precursor,'
or FMRFAL. The deduced 113-amino acid precursor polypeptide contains a
putative hydrophobic leader sequence. Within the precursor, both
FMRF-amide-related peptides are flanked by single or pairs of basic
amino acids, which are potential endopeptidase cleavage sites. The
8-amino acid human NPFF is identical to bovine NPFF but is predicted to
be cleaved from its precursor polypeptide with an additional 3 amino
acids at its N terminus; this 11-amino acid peptide is named NPSF. In an
experiment measuring the effects of NPFF and NPSF on neural activity in
rat spinal cord, bovine NPFF was active, whereas NPSF was inactive. The
authors suggested that the 3 N-terminal amino acids of NPSF are removed
by a peptidase to form the functional NPFF peptide. The 18-amino acid
human NPAF differs from bovine NPAF by 2 amino acids. Human and bovine
NPAF modulated neural activity in rat spinal cord in an
indistinguishable manner.

GENE STRUCTURE

The gene encoding the NPFF and NPAF precursor contains 3 exons (Perry et
al., 1997).

601568	TITLE *601568 ADDUCIN 3; ADD3
;;ADDUCIN, GAMMA;;
ADDUCIN-LIKE; ADDL
ADD3/NUP98 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

From a human fetal-brain cDNA library, Katagiri et al. (1996) isolated a
novel human cDNA which they termed adducin-like 70. The predicted amino
acid sequence shows a high degree of homology to adducins alpha (102680)
and beta (102681). In human erythrocytes, adducin is a 200-kD
heterodimeric skeletal component of the cell membrane, where it promotes
the binding of spectrin to actin. This binding is regulated by
calcium/calmodulin (114180). Adducin also is phosphorylated by protein
kinase C. Adducin and its multiple isoforms represent a family of
proteins present in a variety of tissues and cultured cell lines,
including those from brain, kidney, and liver. The gene, symbolized here
ADDL, contains an open reading frame of 2,022 nucleotides encoding 674
amino acids. It shows 54%, 53%, and 59% identity in predicted amino acid
sequence with alpha and beta components of human adducin and rat adducin
63, respectively. Katagiri et al. (1996) stated that human adducin-like
70 is likely to play an important role in the skeletal organization of
the cell membrane. Northern blot analysis indicated ubiquitous
expression of this gene in adult human tissues.

In a comprehensive assay of gene expression, Gilligan et al. (1999)
showed the ubiquitous expression of alpha- and gamma-adducin, in
contrast to the restricted expression of beta-adducin. Beta-adducin was
expressed at high levels in brain and hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow
in humans, spleen in mice).

By RT-PCR of peripheral blood leukocyte RNA, Citterio et al. (1999)
identified a splice variant of ADD3 that includes exon 13. The deduced
706-amino acid protein contains 32 additional amino acids in its
C-terminal tail compared with the protein described by Katagiri et al.
(1996). RT-PCR detected both splice variants in kidney, brain, lung, and
heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Citterio et al. (1999) determined that the ADD3 gene contains 14 coding
exons and spans over 20 kb.

MAPPING

Katagiri et al. (1996) localized the gene to chromosome 10q24.2-q24.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By radiation hybrid analysis,
Citterio et al. (1999) mapped the ADD3 gene to chromosome 10q24.1-q24.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lanzani et al. (2005) analyzed the ADD3 gene in 40 unrelated individuals
and identified a +386A-G polymorphism (dbSNP rs3731366) in intron 11.
The authors then genotyped 512 newly discovered and never-treated
hypertensive patients (see 145500) for IVS11+386A-G, but found no
association between the polymorphism and ambulatory blood pressure or
plasma levels of renin activity and endogenous ouabain. However,
carriers of a 460W polymorphism in the ADD1 gene (102680.0001) who also
carried the ADD3 G allele had an approximately 8 mm Hg greater increase
in blood pressure than those who carried the ADD3 A allele (p = 0.020 to
0.006, depending on the genetic model applied). Lanzani et al. (2005)
suggested that there were epistatic effects between the ADD1 and ADD3
loci affecting variation in blood pressure.

CYTOGENETICS

- ADD3/NUP98 Fusion Gene

Lahortiga et al. (2003) described a translocation t(10;11)(q25;p15) that
resulted in fusion of the ADD3 gene to the NUP98 gene (601021) on
chromosome 11p15 and development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

606110	TITLE *606110 LY6/NEUROTOXIN 1; LYNX1
;;SECRETED LY6/PLAUR DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; SLURP2;;
SECRETED LY6/UPAR-RELATED PROTEIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LYNX1 gene encodes a protein that shares characteristics with toxins
that bind and inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR; see,
e.g., CHRNA1, 100690) (Miwa et al., 1999). Components of snake venoms
often have structural and functional mammalian homologs. For example,
hemolytic snake venom toxins are related to cellular phospholipases
(e.g., PLA2G1B; 172410), and snake sarafotoxins may be related to
vertebrate endothelins (e.g., EDN1; 131240). The elapid venom
alpha-bungarotoxin also binds to and inhibits nAChR.

CLONING

By screening for central nervous system-specific, developmentally
regulated cDNAs in mouse, Miwa et al. (1999) identified a cDNA encoding
GC26, which was expressed in mouse cerebellum. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 116-amino acid protein contains a signal sequence at
its N terminus, a cysteine-rich consensus motif characteristic of LY6
family proteins (e.g., CD59; 107271) and snake alpha-neurotoxins, and an
asparagine/GPI anchor motif at its C terminus. The overall structure of
GC26 is similar to that of LY6 family proteins and snake
alpha-neurotoxins, and Miwa et al. (1999) redesignated the protein
'Ly6/neurotoxin-1,' or Lynx1. A partial sequence encoding a human Lynx1
homolog has been identified (GenBank GENBANK AF321824). Northern blot
analysis revealed predominant expression of Lynx1 in mouse brain. In
situ hybridization analysis showed Lynx1 expression in neurons in
multiple brain structures. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated expression
of Lynx1 in neuronal soma and proximal dendrites.

Using microarray analysis to identify ESTs expressed predominantly in
the skin of patients with psoriasis vulgaris (see 177900), followed by
PCR and RACE of cultured keratinocyte cDNA libraries, Tsuji et al.
(2003) cloned LYNX1, which they called SLURP2. The deduced 97-amino acid
protein contains a signal peptide and 10 conserved cysteine residues
with a spacing pattern characteristic of the LY6 superfamily, but it
does not have the GPI anchor or transmembrane domains found in
membrane-bound LY6 proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a 0.6-kb
transcript in esophagus and a 1.6-kb transcript in stomach and duodenum.
No expression was detected in other tissues examined, including skin.
RT-PCR detected abundant LYNX1 expression in cervix and esophagus, with
lower expression in adult and fetal skin and keratinocytes. Weak
expression was detected in brain, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon,
rectum, uterus, and thymus. No expression was detected in spleen and
bone marrow. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected a 3.8- to
2.8-fold increase in LYNX1 expression in lesional skin from 5 psoriasis
patients compared with nonlesional skin or normal skin.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analysis by Miwa et al. (1999) indicated that Lynx1 is not a
ligand or neurotransmitter but has the capacity to enhance nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor function in the presence of acetylcholine.

Morishita et al. (2010) identified an increase in expression of Lynx1
protein in mice that prevented plasticity in the primary visual cortex
late in life. Removal of this molecular brake enhanced nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor signaling. Lynx1 expression thus maintains
stability of mature cortical networks in the presence of cholinergic
innervation. Morishita et al. (2010) concluded that modulating the
balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits reactivates visual
plasticity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tsuji et al. (2003) determined that the LYNX1 gene contains 3 exons and
spans about 5.6 kb. The promoter region contains 3 Sp1 (189906)- and 2
AP1 (165160)-binding sites, as well as single sites for E2F (189971) and
GATA3 (131320). It lacks TATA and CAAT consensus sequences. There are 2
major transcriptional initiation sites.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tsuji et al. (2003) mapped the LYNX1 gene
to chromosome 8q24.3. Southern blot analysis indicated that LYNX1 is a
single-copy gene.

EVOLUTION

Human evolution is characterized by a dramatic increase in brain size
and complexity. To probe its genetic basis, Dorus et al. (2004) examined
the evolution of genes involved in diverse aspects of nervous system
biology. These genes, including LYNX1, displayed significantly higher
rates of protein evolution in primates than in rodents. This trend was
most pronounced for the subset of genes implicated in nervous system
development. Moreover, within primates, the acceleration of protein
evolution was most prominent in the lineage leading from ancestral
primates to humans. Dorus et al. (2004) concluded that the phenotypic
evolution of the human nervous system has a salient molecular correlate,
i.e., accelerated evolution of the underlying genes, particularly those
linked to nervous system development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miwa et al. (2006) found that Lynx1 -/- mice showed no gross
abnormalities in size, viability, CNS morphology, or longevity compared
to wildtype mice. However, Lynx1-null mice showed increased learning and
memory in a fear-conditioned paradigm and displayed increased
sensitivity to nicotine in motor tasks compared to wildtype. Neurons
from Lynx1-null mice showed heightened sensitivity and increased
intracellular calcium levels in response to nicotine. Loss of Lynx1
decreased receptor desensitization and enhanced synaptic efficacy.
Mutant neurons were also more sensitive to excitotoxic insult, and Lynx1
mutant mice exhibited age-dependent degeneration that was exacerbated by
nicotine and rescued by null mutations in nAChR subunits. These data
supported the hypotheses that Lynx1 normally decreases activity of
nAChRs and that deletion of Lynx1 shifts the balance in favor of
increased neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. But the short-term
benefits of the loss of Lynx1 were counterbalanced by an increased
vulnerability of Lynx1 mutant neurons to glutamate toxicity and by loss
of nicotine's neuroprotective effect on these cells. Miwa et al. (2006)
concluded that Lynx1 modulates nAChR function to maintain low
sensitivity and plays a critical role in maintaining a balance between
the beneficial effects of short-term nAChR activation and the
degenerative effects of chronic receptor activation.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Antinucleolar antibodies are found in patients with scleroderma or
polymyositis or in patients with overlap of these 2 syndromes. The 2
most prominent proteins in this PMSCL autoantigen complex, PMSCL1
(606180) and PMSCL2, are detected as 75- and 100-kD molecules,
respectively. By screening a thymocyte cDNA library with PMSCL sera,
followed by 5-prime RACE, Ge et al. (1992) obtained a cDNA encoding
PMSCL2. The deduced 860-amino acid protein contains 2 potential
N-glycosylation sites and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 2.7-kb transcript.
Immunoblot analysis confirmed the identity of native and recombinant
100-kD PMSCL2 proteins.

Using affinity-purified anti-100-kD antibodies to screen a HeLa cell
cDNA library, followed by probing a placenta cDNA library, Bluthner and
Bautz (1992) isolated a cDNA encoding PMSCL2. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 885-amino acid protein contains a stretch of amino
acids also found in serine/threonine kinases. Epitope mapping indicated
a major epitope is localized between residues 153 and 324.
Immunofluorescence microscopy using rabbit antisera raised against the
recombinant protein demonstrated nucleolar localization.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the PMSCL2
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG39098).

612209	TITLE *612209 MESOGENIN 1; MSGN1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are transcriptional regulatory
proteins that govern cell fate determination and tissue differentiation
in the embryo. Yoon and Wold (2000) identified a novel bHLH gene, which
they designated mesogenin-1, in mouse and Xenopus. In both organisms the
gene is specifically expressed in unsegmented paraxial mesoderm and its
immediate progenitors.

GENE FUNCTION

Yoon and Wold (2000) found that a striking feature of mesogenin-1
expression is that it terminates abruptly in presumptive somites
(somitomeres). In functional assays, mesogenin-1 from either mouse or
frog efficiently drove nonmesodermal cells to assume a phenotype with
molecular and cellular characteristics of early paraxial mesoderm.

To determine the mechanism controlling somite number, Gomez et al.
(2008) compared somitogenesis in zebrafish, chicken, mouse, and corn
snake embryos. They presented evidence that in all of these species a
similar 'clock-and-wavefront' mechanism operates to control
somitogenesis; in all of them, somitogenesis is brought to an end
through a process in which the presomitic mesoderm, having first
increased in size, gradually shrinks until it is exhausted, terminating
somite formation. Using MSGN1 expression as a readout for posterior
gradients, Gomez et al. (2008) were able to show that in snake embryos,
the segmentation clock rate is much faster relative to developmental
rate than in other amniotes, leading to a greatly increased number of
smaller-sized somites.

MAPPING

Hartz (2008) mapped the MSGN1 gene to chromosome 2p24.2 based on an
alignment of mouse Msgn1 (GenBank GENBANK AF261105) with the human
genomic sequence (build 36.1). Mouse and human MSGN1 share 90.2%
nucleotide sequence identity.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yoon and Wold (2000) found that deletion of the mouse mesogenin-1 gene
caused complete failure of somite formation and segmentation of body
trunk and tail, leading to complete absence of all trunk paraxial
mesoderm derivatives, including skeletal muscle, vertebrae, and ribs at
14.5 days postcoitus. Axial and lateral mesoderm developed normally. At
the molecular level, there was dramatic loss of expression within
presomitic mesoderm of Notch (see 190198)/Delta (see 606582) pathway
components and oscillating somitic clock genes that are thought to
control segmentation and somitogenesis.

600611	TITLE *600611 FK506-BINDING PROTEIN 4; FKBP4
;;T-CELL FK506-BINDING PROTEIN, 59-KD; FKBP59; FKBP52
DESCRIPTION For background information on FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs), see FKBP1A
(186945).

CLONING

Peattie et al. (1992) identified a novel FKBP using an FK506 affinity
matrix. By database analysis, 2 murine DNA sequences were identified,
and PCR primers to these were used to generate a probe for screening a
human placenta cDNA library. A translation of the human cDNA sequence
matched the original partial protein sequence, as well as primary
sequences for other FKBPs. The predicted protein, FKBP52, has a
molecular mass of 52 kD. Northern blot analysis detected FKBP52
transcripts at varying levels in all tissues examined. Peattie et al.
(1992) noted that FKBP52 is apparently identical to a 56- to 59-kD
protein referred to as p56, p59, or FKBP59 in the literature, and they
suggested that phosphorylation of FKBP52 may account for the multiple
reported isoforms.

GENE FUNCTION

Peattie et al. (1992) showed that FKBP52 associated with the 90-kD heat
shock protein (see HSP90A; 140571) in untransformed mammalian steroid
receptor complexes.

FKBP52 is a 'macro' immunophilin that shares high structural and
functional homologies in its N-terminal domain with FKBP12 (FKBP1A;
186945). Unlike FKBP12, however, it does not have immunosuppressant
activity when complexed with FK506. To investigate the physiologic
function of FKBP52, Chambraud et al. (1999) used the yeast 2-hybrid
system as an approach to find its potential protein partners and its
cellular role. They detected an FKBP-associated protein, which by
sequencing was identified as phytanoyl-CoA alpha-hydroxylase (PHYH;
602026), a peroxisomal enzyme. Inactivation of this enzyme is
responsible for Refsum disease (266500) in humans. Chambraud et al.
(1999) showed that PHYH has the physical capacity to interact with the
FKBP12-like domain of FKBP52, but not with FKBP12, suggesting that it is
a particular and specific target of FKBP52. Whereas the binding of
calcineurin (114105) to FKBP12 is potentiated by FK506, the specific
association of PHYH and FKBP52 is maintained in the presence of FK506.
These observations suggested that PHYH is a serious candidate for
studying the cellular signaling pathway(s) involving FKBP52 in the
presence of immunosuppressant drugs.

Fusco et al. (2010) demonstrated that RET51 (see 164761) activation by
both glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; 600837) and NGF
(162030) triggers the formation of a RET51-FKBP52 complex. Substitution
of tyrosine-905 in RET51, a key residue phosphorylated by both GDNF and
NGF, disrupted the RET51-FKBP52 complex. NGF and GDNF have a functional
role in dopaminergic neurons, where RET51 and FKBP52 are expressed. To
clarify the contribution of the RET51-FKBP52 complex in dopaminergic
neurons, Fusco et al. (2010) screened both genes in 30 patients with
Parkinson disease (PD; 168600), in which dopaminergic neurons are
selectively lost. In 1 individual with early-onset PD, the authors found
heterozygous mutations in each gene, which together were sufficient to
disrupt the RET51-FKBP52 complex.

ANIMAL MODEL

Cheung-Flynn et al. (2005) found that male and female Fkbp52 -/- mice
were infertile. Male infertility in Fkbp52 -/- mice was due to
compromised androgen receptor (AR; 313700) function.

Tranguch et al. (2005) found that, in contrast to female progesterone
receptor (Pgr; 607311) -/- mice, female Fkbp52 -/- mice had no ovulation
defect. Gross and histopathologic analysis showed that Fkbp52 -/- uteri
were completely nonreceptive to blastocyst implantation. In situ
hybridization analysis in wildtype mice showed that Fkbp52 and Pgr
expression overlapped in uterine stroma, but Fkbp52 was also expressed
in luminal and glandular epithelium. Uterine refractoriness in Fkbp52
-/- mice was not due to altered expression of Pgr, for which Fkbp52 is a
cochaperone, or Fkbp51 (FKBP5; 602623). However, Pgr activity was not
optimal in Fkbp52 -/- mice, suggesting that the implantation defect was
due to compromised progesterone function. Northern blot and in situ
hybridization analyses showed downregulated expression of
progesterone-responsive genes in Fkbp52 -/- uteri. Tranguch et al.
(2005) concluded that FKBP52 is a critical determinant of uterine
progesterone actions in preparing the uterus for blastocyst
implantation.

Tranguch et al. (2007) demonstrated implantation failure in female
Fkbp52-null C57BL6/129 and CD1 mice. Progesterone supplementation
rescued implantation and decidualization in CD1, but not C57BL6/129,
Fkbp52-null females. Experimentally-induced decidualization in the
absence of blastocysts failed in Fkbp52-null females on either
background even with progesterone supplementation, suggesting that
embryonic signaling complements uterine signaling for this event. In
Fkbp52-null CD1 females, administration of progesterone at higher than
normal pregnancy levels was sufficient for implantation but failed to
maintain pregnancy to full term; elevating progesterone levels further
resulted in successful term pregnancy with normal litter size. Tranguch
et al. (2007) concluded that the requirement for FKBP52 in uterine
progesterone/PGR signaling is a function of genetic disparity and is
pregnancy-stage specific.

Chen et al. (2010) stated that male mice with targeted ablation of
Fkbp52 develop hypospadias. They found that Fkbp52 expression was
enriched in the ventral aspect of the developing mouse urethral
epithelium at embryonic day 18.5, when the final urethra normally forms
via closure of the enveloping epithelial layers. Scanning electron
microscopy revealed that Fkbp52 -/- males had reduced elevation of
prepucial swelling, leading to a defect in urethral seam formation. In
situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis suggested that
Fkbp52 mutants had a normal urethral epithelium signaling center and
epithelial differentiation, but Fkbp52 mutant ventral epithelial cells
had a reduced apoptotic cell index at the site of fusion and a defect in
genital mesenchymal cell migration in vitro. Supplementation of
gestating females with excess testosterone partially rescued the
phenotype. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed normal
occupancy of Ar at Ar-responsive gene promoters, but reduced Ar activity
at genes controlling sexual dimorphism and cell growth was observed.
Chen et al. (2010) concluded that Fkbp52 functions downstream of Ar in
urethra morphogenesis.

611171	TITLE *611171 KIAA1598 GENE; KIAA1598
;;SHOOTIN1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned KIAA1598. The deduced protein
contains 446 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected very high expression in
adult brain, followed by liver, kidney, pancreas, and spinal cord.
Expression was moderate in heart, lung, spleen, testis, ovary, fetal
liver, and fetal brain, and low in adult skeletal muscle. Expression was
high in all specific adult brain regions examined, particularly in
thalamus and hippocampus.

By database analysis, Toriyama et al. (2006) determined that the
KIAA1598 gene, which they called SHOOTIN1, encodes a 456-amino acid
protein with a calculated molecular mass of 52.6 kD. KIAA1598 contains 3
coiled-coil domains and a proline-rich region.

GENE FUNCTION

Toriyama et al. (2006) found Shootin1 upregulated during polarization of
rat hippocampal neurons in culture. Expression fluctuated among multiple
neurites and eventually Shootin1 accumulated asymmetrically in a single
neurite, which led to axon induction and neuron polarization. Disturbing
the asymmetric organization of Shootin1 with excess Shootin1 disrupted
polarization, whereas repressing Shootin1 expression inhibited
polarization. Overexpression and RNA interference studies suggested that
Shootin1 was required for spatially localized phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(see PIK3CG; 601232) activity. Shootin1 showed anterograde transport to
the growth cones and diffused back to the soma, and inhibition of this
transport prevented its asymmetric accumulation in neurons. Toriyama et
al. (2006) proposed that Shootin1 is involved in the generation of
internal asymmetric signals required for neuronal polarization.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
KIAA1598 gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP RH77773).

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening human brain cDNAs for the potential to encode proteins that
are at least 50 kD, Nagase et al. (1998) isolated an SLC21A9 cDNA, which
they called KIAA0880, that contains a complete coding sequence. The
predicted 709-amino acid SLC21A9 protein contains 8 membrane-spanning
regions. SLC21A9 shares 42.8% amino acid sequence identity with a rat
prostaglandin transporter across 678 residues. RT-PCR followed by ELISA
detected SLC21A9 expression in all human tissues examined, with the
highest expression in liver, lower expression in lung, ovary, brain,
heart, kidney, pancreas, spleen, and testis, and lowest expression in
skeletal muscle.

By searching EST databases for sequences similar to OATP (SLCO1A2;
602883), followed by RT-PCR of adult brain RNA, Tamai et al. (2000)
cloned SLCO2B1, which they designated OATPB. The deduced 709-amino acid
protein has 12 potential transmembrane regions and several
phosphorylation and N-glycosylation sites. RT-PCR detected OATPB
expression in adult pancreas, liver, lung, gut, ovary, testis, and
spleen, and in all fetal tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are a family of
multispecific carriers that mediate the sodium-independent transport of
steroid hormone and conjugates, drugs, and numerous anionic endogenous
substrates. St-Pierre et al. (2002) investigated whether members of the
OATP gene family could mediate fetal-maternal transfer of anionic
steroid conjugates in the human placenta. They isolated OATPB from a
placenta cDNA library. An antiserum to OATPB detected an 85-kD protein
in basal but not apical syncytiotrophoblast membranes.
Immunohistochemistry of first-, second-, and third-trimester placenta
showed staining in the cytotrophoblast membranes and at the basal
surface of the syncytiotrophoblast. Trophoblasts that reacted with an
antibody to Ki-67, a proliferation-associated antigen, expressed lower
levels of OATPB. OATPB mRNA levels were measured in isolated
trophoblasts under culture conditions that promoted syncytia formation.
Real-time quantitative PCR estimated an 8-fold increase in OATPB
expression on differentiation to syncytia. Pregnenolone sulfate
partially inhibited OATPB-mediated transport of estrone-3-sulfate in an
oocyte expression system. The authors concluded that these findings
suggested a physiologic role for OATPB in the placental uptake of
fetal-derived sulfated steroids.

Tamai et al. (2000) overexpressed OATPB in HEK293 cells and found that
it mediated transport of estrone-3-sulfate and, more weakly,
prostaglandin E2.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nagase et al. (1998)
mapped the SLC21A9 gene to chromosome 11. By radiation hybrid analysis,
Tamai et al. (2000) mapped the SLCO2B1 gene to chromosome 11, between
markers D11S916 and D11S911.

;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.

182880	TITLE *182880 SPERM PROTAMINE P1; PRM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Protamines are small, arginine-rich, nuclear proteins that replace
histones (e.g., 142709) late in the haploid phase of spermatogenesis and
are believed essential for sperm head condensation and DNA
stabilization. Mice, humans, and certain fish have 2 or more different
protamines, whereas the sperm of bull, boar, rat, rabbit, guinea pig,
and ram have one form of protamine. The 2 human protamines are denoted
P1 and P2 (PRM2; 182890). The amino acid sequence of both has been
determined (Ammer et al., 1986). Of the 50 amino acid residues of P1, 24
are arginines and 6 are cysteines. Ammer et al. (1986) found 2 forms of
P2 that differ by the presence in one of 3 additional amino acids at the
N terminus. Of the 57 residues of the longer form, 27 are arginines and
5 are cysteines. The nucleotide sequence of the 2 mouse protamine cDNAs
predict markedly different amino acid sequences, a conclusion in
agreement with data on amino acid composition and on electrophoretic
mobility.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krawetz et al. (1989) showed that there is a single copy of the human P1
protamine gene, that the mRNA is approximately 450 bases long, and that
the gene contains an intron.

Domenjoud et al. (1990) showed that both PRM1 and PRM2 have a single
intron, consisting of 91 and 163 bp, respectively. Both genes were found
to contain typical TATAA and CAAT boxes at conventional distances from
the transcription start points which, by use of primary extension
experiments, were assigned to nucleotides -91 and -110 for PRM1 and
PRM2, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Choudhary et al. (1995) referred to the linear array of PRM1, which they
stated is located on 16p13.2, as a multigenic locus. To study the
mechanisms that govern expression in the male gamete, they constructed a
transgenic mouse model. A segment of human chromosome 16 harboring the
PRM1--PRM2--TNP2 gene cluster was introduced into fertilized mouse eggs.
This 40,255-bp fragment contained sufficient information to express
faithfully all the members of this multigene family in a copy
number-dependent but position-independent manner in the heterologous
system. A DNase I-sensitive domain of approximately 28.5 kb encompassing
the human gene cluster was bounded by an array of topoisomerase II
consensus sites. These results established that, like somatic cells, the
genes transcribed by the male gamete are organized at specific loci as
functional domains. The concept that transcriptionally competent
chromatin assumes an altered nuclear structure had been validated for
somatic cells when it was shown that the beta-globin gene (141900)
acquired a DNase I-sensitive conformation within cells in which it was
expressed. Choudhary et al. (1995) found that the 28.5-kb segment
containing the 3 genes integrated into independent chromosomal sites
while maintaining its fidelity of transcription. All members of the
cluster were expressed in proportion similar to those in human testis.
Furthermore, DNase I sensitivity established that in sperm the gene
domain is bounded by an array of nuclear matrix-associated topoisomerase
II (126430) consensus sites. This was the first description of a
multigenic male gamete-specific domain as a fundamental gene regulatory
unit.

Protamines, the major DNA-binding proteins in the nucleus of sperm in
most vertebrates, package the DNA in a volume less than 5% of a somatic
cell nucleus. Many mammals have one protamine, but a few species,
including humans and mice, have 2. Cho et al. (2001) used gene targeting
to determine if the second protamine provides redundancy to an essential
process, or if both protamines are necessary. They disrupted the coding
sequence of 1 allele of either Prm1 or Prm2 in embryonic stem (ES) cells
derived from 129-strain mice, and injected them into blastocysts from
C57BL/6-strain mice. Male chimeras produced 129-genotype sperm with
disrupted Prm1 or Prm2 alleles, but failed to sire offspring carrying
the 129 genome. They also found that a decrease in the amount of either
protamine disrupted nuclear formation, processing of protamine-2, and
normal sperm function. Their studies indicated that both protamines are
essential and that haploinsufficiency caused by a mutation in 1 allele
of either gene prevents genetic transmission of both mutant and wildtype
alleles.

MAPPING

From studies of hamster/mouse hybrids, Hecht et al. (1986) found that
both of the protamines of mice are coded by chromosome 16. Perhaps the
synteny permits coordinate regulation. These may be genes that are
expressed in the haploid state.

Reeves et al. (1987, 1987) also found that the protamine-1 locus is on
chromosome 16 of the mouse. By linkage studies, Reeves et al. (1987,
1989) showed that Prm1 is located near the proximal end of mouse
chromosome 16. No recombinants between Prm1 and Prm2 were found. In the
Chinese hamster, furthermore, probes specific for Prm1 and Prm2
hybridized to the same restriction fragment after digestion of hamster
genomic DNA with any of 5 different restriction endonucleases.

By studies in rodent/human cell hybrids, Reeves et al. (1987, 1989)
demonstrated that PRM1 is located on chromosome 16 in humans.

Krawetz et al. (1989) mapped the human PRM1 gene to chromosome 16q21 by
a combination of somatic cell hybrid studies and in situ hybridization.
By in situ hybridization, Engel (1990) found that PRM1 and PRM2 are in
the same 4.8-kb fragment and map to 16p13.3. Viguie et al. (1990) found,
also by in situ hybridization, that both PRM1 and PRM2 map to 16p13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Iguchi et al. (2006) analyzed the PRM1 gene in 30 unrelated infertile
men and 10 men of pregnancy-proven fertility. In 3 of the infertile men,
they identified heterozygosity for a 197G-T SNP, predicted to result in
an arg34-to-ser (R34S) substitution in a highly conserved arginine
cluster. The authors noted that this appeared to be an uncommon SNP, as
it was not found in 522 men from previous studies (270 fertile, 226
sterile, and 26 unselected) nor in 220 individuals from 2 SNP databases.
Kichine et al. (2008) screened 361 infertile and 672 fertile men for the
197G-T SNP, which they designated 102G-T, and found 3 heterozygotes, 2
from the fertile group and 1 who had obstructive infertility (agenesis
of the vas deferens). Another SNP in the PRM1 gene, a -107G-C
transversion, was not found in any of the 672 fertile men but in 2 of
192 infertile men, both of sub-Saharan African origin; however, in a
screening of unselected samples from similar regions, 3 of 95 Comorian
men and 12 of 67 Congolese men were found to be 107C carriers. Kichine
et al. (2008) concluded that neither SNP has a significant effect on
male fertility.

ANIMAL MODEL

Okada et al. (2007) used a loss-of-function approach to demonstrate that
the mouse H3K9me2/1-specific demethylase Jhdm2a (611512) is essential
for spermatogenesis. They showed that Jhdm2a-deficient mice exhibit
postmeiotic chromatin condensation defects, and that Jhdm2a directly
binds to and controls the expression of transition nuclear protein-1
(TNP1; 190231) and PRM1 genes, the products of which are required for
packaging and condensation of sperm chromatin. Thus, Okada et al. (2007)
concluded that their work uncovered a role for JHDM2A in spermatogenesis
and revealed transition nuclear protein and protamine genes as direct
targets of JHDM2A.

614479	TITLE *614479 MALONYL CoA:ACP ACYLTRANSFERASE, MITOCHONDRIAL; MCAT
;;MITOCHONDRIAL MALONYLTRANSFERASE;;
MT, MITOCHONDRIAL
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MCAT (EC 2.3.1.39) is the catalytic subunit of the type II
malonyl-CoA-dependent system for biosynthesis of fatty acids in
mitochondria (Zhang et al., 2003).

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2003) cloned human MCAT, which they called mitochondrial
MT. The deduced 390-amino acid protein has an N-terminal cleavable
mitochondrial targeting signal, a GxSxG serine esterase active-site
motif, and conserved arg and his residues required for activity.
Fluorescence-tagged MCAT colocalized with a mitochondrial marker
following expression in HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2003) found that human mitochondrial MT expressed in
insect cells had a narrower substrate specificity than cytosolic MT
(FASN; 600212) and transferred a malonyl moiety to the mitochondrial
malonyl acceptor ACP (NDUFAB1; 603836) only.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang et al. (2003) determined that the MCAT gene contains 4 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Zhang et al. (2003) mapped the MCAT gene
to chromosome 22q13.31.

605687	TITLE *605687 INTERLEUKIN 19; IL19
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

IL19 belongs to the IL10 (124092) family of cytokines, which also
includes IL20 (605619), MDA7 (604136), and IL22 (605330). IL10 is a
multifunctional cytokine that has antiinflammatory properties through
its ability to downregulate antigen presentation and macrophage
activation. It also plays a role in B-cell activation and autoantibody
production (Blumberg et al., 2001).

CLONING

By searching EST databases using IL10 as probe, followed by screening an
Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell cDNA library, Gallagher et al.
(2000) obtained a cDNA encoding IL19. The predicted 177-amino acid
protein contains a signal peptide, 2 potential N-linked glycosylation
sites, and 4 conserved cysteine residues necessary for correct folding
of the IL10 monomer. IL19 shares 82% identity with IL10 in the
hydrophobic core, but only 53% similarity in the putative IL10
receptor-alpha (IL10RA; 146933)-interacting residues. Western blot
analysis showed expression of a 35- to 40-kD protein that was reduced to
21 kD by glycosidase treatment.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Northern blot kinetic analysis, Gallagher et al. (2000) showed
that IL10 was expressed before IL19 in lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-stimulated monocytes. IL19 expression was enhanced in the presence
of IL4 (147780) or IL13 (147683), but not gamma-interferon (IFNG;
147570), in LPS-stimulated monocytes. Granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF; 138960), but not other cytokines, was
capable of inducing IL19 expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gallagher et al. (2000) determined that the IL19 gene spans nearly 6 kb
and, like IL10, contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Blumberg et al. (2001) determined that the
IL10, IL19, 1L20, and MDA7 genes are tightly linked within a 195-kb
region, the IL10 family cytokine cluster, on chromosome 1q32.

103020	TITLE *103020 ADENYLATE KINASE 2; AK2
;;ADENYLATE KINASE, MITOCHONDRIAL MYOKINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Nucleoside monophosphate kinases, including adenylate kinases, catalyze
the reversible phosphorylation between nucleoside triphosphates and
monophosphates.

CLONING

Bruns and Regina (1977) analyzed the subcellular compartmentalization of
adenylate kinase-2 (EC 2.7.4.3) in HeLa cells, mouse RAG cells, and
RAG-human hybrids expressing human AK2. The results indicated that AK2
is a mitochondrial enzyme.

Noma et al. (1998) isolated cDNAs encoding human adenylate kinase-2 from
a HeLa cell cDNA library, using bovine AK2 cDNA as probe. Two
transcripts were identified: one, designated AK2A, encodes a deduced
239-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 26.5 kD, and
the other, designated AK2B, encodes a deduced 232-amino acid protein
with a predicted molecular mass of 25.6 kD. Northern blot analysis
demonstrated 3 strong hybridizing signals of 0.9 (AK2A), 1.7 (AK2B), and
3.5 kb, with high expression in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and
pancreas, moderate expression in kidney, placenta, and brain, and weak
expression in lung. However, Western blot analysis showed high levels of
AK2 protein in liver, heart, and kidney, low levels in lung, and
undetectable levels in brain and skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

The existence of a second adenylate kinase locus linked to PGM1 and
peptidase C, i.e., on chromosome 1, was suggested by cell hybridization
studies by Van Cong et al. (1972). The Goss-Harris method of mapping
combines features of recombinational study in families and synteny tests
in hybrid cells. As applied to chromosome 1, the method shows that AK2
and UMPK are distal to PGM1 and that the order of the loci is PGM1:
UMPK: (AK2, alpha-FUC): ENO1 (Goss and Harris, 1977). Carritt et al.
(1982) presented evidence that AK2 is in 1p34.

GENE FUNCTION

Lee et al. (2007) showed that intrinsic apoptosis in human cells that
was induced by the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide or the antibiotic
staurosporine, but not by FAS ligand (TNFSF6; 134638) or TRAIL (TNFSF10;
603598), caused translocation of AK2 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm,
followed by formation of a complex between AK2, FADD (602457), and
CASP10 (601762). Yeast 2-hybrid analysis, protein pull-down assays, and
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the N- and C-terminal domains
of AK2, which include nucleoside- and substrate-binding domains,
respectively, bound the C-terminal death domain of FADD. AK2 binding
promoted association of CASP10 with FADD, and addition of purified AK2
protein to cell extracts induced activation of CASP10 via FADD, leading
to subsequent activation of CASP9 (602234) and CASP3 (600636). Apoptosis
through the AK2 complex did not correlate with the adenylate kinase
activity of AK2, did not require CASP8 (601763)-mediated apoptotic
responses, and did not involve mitochondrial cytochrome c release.
Immunodepletion or knockdown of AK2, FADD, or CASP10 abrogated
etoposide-induced apoptosis, and AK2 complexes were not observed in
several etoposide-resistant human tumor cell lines that were deficient
in expression of FADD, CASP10, or CASP3. In contrast to the findings in
human cells, etoposide-induced apoptosis was observed in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts that lacked Fadd expression. Since mice also lack Casp10,
Lee et al. (2007) concluded that mice lack an apoptotic pathway
comparable to the AK2-FADD-CASP10 pathway in humans.

Pannicke et al. (2009) showed that knockdown of zebrafish ak2 also leads
to aberrant leukocyte development, demonstrating the evolutionarily
conserved role of AK2. They concluded that their results provide in vivo
evidence for AK2 selectivity in leukocyte differentiation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 6 affected individuals from 5 families segregating reticular
dysgenesis (267500), Pannicke et al. (2009) identified 6 causative
mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous state
(103020.0001-103020.0006).

Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009) identified biallelic mutations in AK2
(103020.0007-103020.0013) in 7 individuals with reticular dysgenesis.
These mutations resulted in absent or strongly decreased protein
expression. The authors then demonstrated that restoration of AK2
expression in the bone marrow cells of individuals with reticular
dysgenesis overcomes the neutrophil differentiation arrest, underlining
its specific requirement in the development of a restricted set of
hematopoietic lineages. Finally, Lagresle-Peyrou et al. (2009)
established that AK2 is specifically expressed in the stria vascularis
region of the inner ear, which provides an explanation for the
sensorineural deafness in these individuals. Lagresle-Peyrou et al.
(2009) concluded that their results identified a previously unknown
mechanism involved in regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation
in one of the most severe human immunodeficiency syndromes.

606907	TITLE *606907 APOLIPOPROTEIN M; APOM
;;NG20, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Xu and Dahlback (1999) identified APOM through N-terminal sequencing of
proteins associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRLP). By
searching 2 liver cDNA libraries with probes designed from an EST
containing the sequence, they cloned human APOM. The deduced 188-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 21 kD. It contains
a potential N-glycosylation site, 2 possible disulfide bridges, and a
hydrophobic alpha-helical signal peptide that is retained in the mature
protein. Sequence analysis revealed 79% identity between the human and
mouse proteins. Northern blot analysis by Xu and Dahlback (1999)
detected restricted expression of a 750-bp transcript in liver and
kidney. Northern blot analysis of several cell lines by Albertella et
al. (1996) detected a 1.1-kb transcript in HepG2 liver cells but not in
human fibroblast, leukocyte, or monocytic cell lines. By Western blot
analysis, Xu and Dahlback (1999) found that APOM is a minor component of
high and low density lipoproteins as well as TGRLP. In vitro translation
in the presence of microsomes resulted in a protein of 26 kD, suggesting
that APOM is translocated through the membrane and glycosylated.

GENE STRUCTURE

By Southern blot analysis, Albertella et al. (1996) determined that APOM
is present in single copy in the genome.

MAPPING

By homology with the corresponding mouse gene, Ng20, which maps to
chromosome 17, and by sequence analysis, Xu and Dahlback (1999) mapped
the human APOM gene to chromosome 6p21.3, between the BAT3 (142590) and
BAT4 (142610) genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wolfrum et al. (2005) demonstrated that mice deficient in Apom
accumulated cholesterol in large HDL particles while the conversion of
HDL to pre-beta-HDL was impaired, leading to a markedly reduced
cholesterol efflux from macrophages to Apom-deficient HDL compared to
normal HDL in vitro. Overexpression of Apom in low density lipoprotein
receptor (LDLR; 606945)-null mice protected against atherosclerosis when
the mice were challenged with a cholesterol-enriched diet. Wolfrum et
al. (2005) concluded that APOM is important for the formation of
pre-beta-HDL and cholesterol efflux to HDL, and thereby inhibits
formation of atherosclerotic lesions.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterases (EC 3.1.2.2), such as ACOT7, are found
in all organisms and cleave fatty acyl-CoAs into free fatty acids and
CoA.

CLONING

Engberg et al. (1997) purified a liver cytosolic isoform of long-chain
acyl-CoA thioesterase from peroxisome proliferator-treated rats and
named it CTE-II for 'cytosolic long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase.'
Antibodies against CTE-II were used to screen an expression library of
peroxisome proliferator-induced rat liver cDNA. The predicted 338-amino
acid protein migrated at 40 kD on SDS-PAGE. Engberg et al. (1997)
observed many evenly distributed nucleotide differences and pronounced
differences in the C-terminal regions between CTE-II and the closely
related ACT (602586) and suggested that the 2 enzymes are encoded by
different genes. Engberg et al. (1997) noted that there are human ESTs
homologous to CTE-II.

Yamada et al. (1997) isolated cDNAs encoding long-chain acyl-CoA
hydrolases from rat brain and liver cDNA libraries and designated the
clones Bach and Lach, respectively. Since the nucleotide sequences of
the N-terminal regions were entirely different but the downstream
sequences were virtually identical, Yamada et al. (1997) suggested that
Bach and Lach are derived from the same gene by alternative splicing.

Using a rat Bach cDNA to screen a human brain cDNA library, Yamada et
al. (1999) cloned BACH. The deduced protein contains 338 amino acids and
shares 95% identity with rat Bach. Northern blot analysis detected a
1.9-kb BACH transcript in human brain RNA. Biochemical analysis of human
brain homogenates showed that BACH is a cytosolic enzyme. SDS-PAGE
detected BACH at 43 kD, but gel filtration detected BACH at about 100
kD, indicating that the protein forms multimers.

By 5-prime RACE and RT-PCR of human brain total RNA, Yamada et al.
(2002) identified 6 BACH splice variants. Four variants, designated
BACHa to BACHd, differ in their use of 1 of 4 alternate first exons
(exons 1a through 1d, respectively) and encode proteins of 329 to 380
amino acids. All 4 of these proteins contain the hydrolase domain and a
bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in their C-terminal halves,
and BACHb and BACHc have N-terminal mitochondrial localization signals.
The 2 remaining variants contain exon X, an alternatively spliced exon
between exons 7 and 8 that causes a frameshift and introduces a
premature stop codon. These C-terminally truncated proteins of 246 and
283 amino acids lack the hydrolase domain and NLS. The BACH proteins
containing the mitochondrial localization signal were detected in
mitochondria of transfected mouse neuroblastoma cells, but those
containing only the NLS did not localize to nuclei, even though the
isolated NLS was functional when fused to a test protein.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human brain detected BACHa in the
cytosol of neurons such as pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and
Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. In mouse brain, Bacha was also
detected in nuclei as well as cytosol of certain large neurons in the
cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. Yamada et al. (2002)
suggested that the NLS of BACH may be masked by the full-length protein
as a regulatory mechanism.

GENE FUNCTION

Yamada et al. (1997) found that bacterial extracts of E. coli expressing
either rat Bach or Lach cDNAs had 100-fold higher acyl-CoA hydrolase
activity, demonstrating that both cDNAs encode long-chain acyl-CoA
hydrolases.

By analyzing the activity of purified BACH against several fatty
acyl-CoAs, Yamada et al. (1999) found that BACH showed a relatively
broad specificity, with acyl-CoAs with carbon chains of C8 to C18 being
good substrates. BACH activity was inhibited by a sulfhydryl blocking
agent. Recombinant BACH was also active against palmitoyl-CoA.

Yang et al. (2004) found significantly decreased levels of acyl-CoA
hydrolase in hippocampal tissue from 5 patients with mesial temporal
lobe epilepsy (608096) compared to controls.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yamada et al. (2002) determined that the ACOT7 gene contains 13 exons,
including 4 alternative first exons (exons 1a through 1d) and exon X, an
alternatively spliced exon between exons 7 and 8. The gene spans 129 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Yamada et al. (1999) mapped the ACOT7 gene
to chromosome 1p36.2. Hunt et al. (2005) stated that the human ACOT7
gene maps to chromosome 1p36.31-p36.11 and the mouse Acot7 gene maps to
chromosome 4E2.

NOMENCLATURE

Hunt et al. (2005) noted that acyl-CoA thioesterases are referred to in
the literature as acyl-CoA hydrolases, but the reaction catalyzed is the
cleavage of a thioester bond. They presented a revised nomenclature for
these enzymes using the name acyl-CoA thioesterase and the root gene
symbol ACOT.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The HSD17B4 gene encodes an enzyme involved in peroxisomal fatty acid
beta-oxidation. It was first identified as a 17-beta-estradiol
dehydrogenase (Leenders et al., 1996; van Grunsven et al., 1998).

Peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids, originally described by
Lazarow and de Duve (1976), is catalyzed by 3 enzymes: acyl-CoA oxidase
(see, e.g., ACOX1, 609751); the 'D-bifunctional enzyme,' with
enoyl-CoA-hydratase and D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, and
3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (604054).

See also the L-bifunctional peroxisomal protein (EHHADH; 607037). The D-
and L-bifunctional proteins have different substrate specificities. The
D-bifunctional protein catalyzes the formation of 3-ketoacyl-CoA
intermediates from both straight-chain and 2-methyl-branched-chain fatty
acids and also acts in shortening cholesterol for bile acid formation.
In contrast, the L-specific bifunctional protein does not have the
latter 2 activities (Jiang et al., 1997).

CLONING

Adamski et al. (1995) cloned a fourth type of 17-beta-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase, HSD17B4, from a human liver cDNA library. The HSD17B4
gene encodes a 736-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular
mass of approximately 80 kD and less than 25% identity with the 3
previously characterized 17-HSDs (HSD17B1, 109684; HSD17B2, 109685; and
HSD17B3, 605573). Northern blot analysis revealed that HSD17B4 is
expressed in many tissues as an approximately 3.0-kb mRNA transcript,
with highest expression in liver, heart, prostate, and testis. Adamski
et al. (1995) overexpressed the gene in mammalian cells and found that
HSD17B4 displays specific unidirectional oxidative 17-HSD activity.

Jiang et al. (1996) purified and characterized a medium-chain enoyl-CoA
hydratase from human liver. By immunohistochemistry, they confirmed the
presence of the enzyme in peroxisomes of cultured human skin
fibroblasts. Jiang et al. (1997) determined the DNA and peptide
sequences of medium-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase and found that it was
identical to that of human 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase IV. The
native enzyme is a 77-kD polypeptide.

By analysis of the porcine enzyme, Leenders et al. (1996) determined
that the N-terminal region (residues 1-323) encodes the 17-steroid
dehydrogenase activity, whereas the central region (residues 324-596)
catalyzes the hydratase activity. The C-terminal portion facilitates the
transfer of 7-dehydrocholesterol and phosphatidylcholine between
membranes in vitro. The authors emphasized the unique ability of a
single protein to catalyze different reactions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Leenders et al. (1998) found that the HSD17B4 gene contains 24 exons and
spans more than 100 kb.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Leenders et al. (1996) mapped the
HSD17B4 gene to human chromosome 5q2.

GENE FUNCTION

Green et al. (1999) investigated HSD17B1, -2, -3, and -4 gene expression
and HSD17B estrogenic activity in human anterior pituitary adenomas.
HSD17B mRNA expression was studied by RT-PCR in 42 pituitary tumors and
3 normal pituitaries, HSD17B activity was studied in 11 tumors, and
HSD17B1 was immunolocalized in vitro in 6 tumors. HSD17B1 gene
expression was detected in 34 of 42 (81%) adenomas in all tumor
subtypes; HSD17B2 mRNA was detected in 18 of 42 (43%) adenomas but not
in prolactinomas; HSD17B3 mRNA was detected in 12 of 42 (29%) adenomas
but not in corticotropinomas; and HSD17B4 was expressed in 20 of 42
(48%) adenomas by all adenoma subtypes. All 4 HSD17B isoforms were
variably expressed in human anterior pituitary adenomas, which also
showed HSD17B enzyme activity, suggesting that HSD17B may play an
important role in regulating the local cellular levels of estradiol.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- D-Bifunctional Protein Deficiency

In 2 Japanese patients with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Suzuki et al. (1997) identified 2 different homozygous mutations in the
HSD17B4 gene (601860.0001; 601860.0002). The patients had previously
been diagnosed with L-bifunctional protein deficiency by complementation
analysis (Suzuki et al., 1994).

In an infant with a defect in peroxisomal beta-oxidation, van Grunsven
et al. (1998) demonstrated D-bifunctional protein deficiency caused by a
homozygous mutation in the HSD17B4 gene (601860.0003).

In a patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency originally reported
by Watkins et al. (1989), van Grunsven et al. (1999) identified a
homozygous 2-bp deletion in the HSD17B4 gene (601860.0007). The patient
was originally thought to have L-bifunctional protein deficiency based
on immunoblot analysis of postmortem liver tissue. However, reanalysis
showed accumulation of both very long chain fatty acids and bile acid
intermediates, which was hard to reconcile with an isolated deficiency
of the L-bifunctional protein. The results suggested that most, if not
all, patients whose peroxisomal disorder had been diagnosed as
L-bifunctional protein deficiency were in fact cases of D-bifunctional
protein deficiency.

Nakano et al. (2001) reported a patient with D-bifunctional protein
deficiency who was compound heterozygous for 2 mutations in the HSD17B4
gene (601860.0001 and 601860.0005).

Ferdinandusse et al. (2002) reinvestigated the patient of Goldfischer et
al. (1986), who was the only patient ever reported with a presumed
deficiency of peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (604054). Molecular
analysis identified a homozygous deletion in the HSD17B4 gene
(601860.0006), confirming a diagnosis of D-bifunctional protein
deficiency.

Ferdinandusse et al. (2006) reported the mutational spectrum of DBP
deficiency on the basis of molecular analysis in 110 patients. They
identified 61 different mutations by DBP cDNA analysis, 48 of which had
not been previously reported. The predicted effects of the different
disease-causing amino acid changes in protein structure were determined
using the crystal structures. The effects ranged from the replacement of
catalytic amino acid residues or residues in direct contact with the
substrate or cofactor to disturbances of protein folding or dimerization
of the subunits. To study whether there is a genotype-phenotype
correlation for DBP deficiency, these structure-based analyses were
combined with extensive biochemical analyses of patient material
(cultured skin fibroblasts and plasma) and available clinical
information on the patients. They found that the effect of the mutations
identified in patients with a relatively mild clinical and biochemical
presentation was less detrimental to the protein structure than the
effect of mutations identified in those with a very severe presentation.
These results suggested that the amount of residual DBP activity
correlates with the severity of the phenotype. Thus the data indicated
that on the basis of the predicted effect of mutations on protein
structure, a genotype-phenotype correlation exists for DBP deficiency.

Ferdinandusse et al. (2006) found that the missense mutation G16S
(601860.0003) is by far the most common mutation causing DBP deficiency
(type III), which had in their study an allele frequency of
approximately 24% and was detected in 28 of the 110 patients. The second
most common mutation causing DBP deficiency (type II) was the missense
mutation N457Y (601860.0004), which had an allele frequency of
approximately 11% and was found in 13 patients. Of 5 patients for whom
homozygosity was checked, 2 turned out to be heterozygotes at the
genomic level.

In DBP type I-deficient patients, Ferdinandusse et al. (2006) found only
deletions, insertions, and nonsense mutations. All deletions resulted in
a truncated protein, except for 3 large in-frame deletions. Two patients
with DBP type-II deficiency had in-frame deletions in the hydratase
unit. All other DBP type II-deficient patients had missense mutations in
the coding region of the DBP hydratase unit. DBP type III deficiency was
predominantly caused by missense mutations and, in 2 cases, by a 1-amino
acid deletion in the coding region of the dehydrogenase unit.

- Perrault Syndrome 1

Pierce et al. (2010) performed whole-exome sequencing of genomic DNA
from a woman with Perrault syndrome-1 (PRLTS1; 233400), which is
characterized by ovarian dysgenesis and sensorineural deafness,
originally described by McCarthy and Opitz (1985) and identified 2 rare
variants in the HSD17B4 gene (601860.0008 and 601860.0009). Sequencing
revealed that both the proband and her affected sister were compound
heterozygous for the missense (Y217C) and nonsense (Y568X) mutations,
and that their unaffected mother was heterozygous for the missense
mutation. Pierce et al. (2010) noted that Perrault syndrome and DBP
deficiency overlap clinically, and suggested that mutations in HSD17B4
leading to DBP deficiency that is mild enough to allow survival to the
age of puberty are likely to cause ovarian dysgenesis in females in
addition to the known neurologic defects. The authors predicted that
because the affected sisters were likely to express only protein with
the Y217C mutation, they would have so-called type III DBP deficiency,
with a defect in dehydrogenase activity.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, 52-BP DEL

In a Japanese patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Suzuki et al. (1997) identified a 52-bp deletion in the HSD17B4 gene,
resulting in a 17-amino acid deletion and premature termination. Studies
of postmortem liver tissue confirmed absence of the activity and
immunoreactivity of D-bifunctional protein. The patient was previously
thought to have L-bifunctional protein deficiency (Suzuki et al., 1994).

.0002
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, 237-BP DEL

In a Japanese patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Suzuki et al. (1997) identified a 237-bp deletion in the HSD17B4 gene,
resulting in a 79-amino acid deletion. Studies of postmortem liver
tissue confirmed absence of the activity and immunoreactivity of
D-bifunctional protein. The patient was previously thought to have
L-bifunctional protein deficiency (Suzuki et al., 1994).

.0003
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, GLY16SER

In an infant with a D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515), van
Grunsven et al. (1998) identified a 46G-A transition in the HSD17B4
gene, resulting in a gly16-to-ser (G16S) substitution within an
important loop of the Rossman fold forming the NAD(+)-binding site.
Biochemical analysis showed that the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
activity of the D-bifunctional protein was completely inactive, whereas
the enoyl-CoA hydratase component was active. Their findings showed that
the D-bifunctional protein plays an essential role in the peroxisomal
beta-oxidation pathway that cannot be compensated for by the L-specific
bifunctional protein. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation.

Van Grunsven et al. (1999) demonstrated the G16S mutation in 9
additional patients previously thought to have deficiency of
L-bifunctional protein on the basis of complementation studies. The
findings confirmed D-bifunctional protein deficiency in these cases.

.0004
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, ASN457TYR

In 2 unrelated patients with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
van Grunsven et al. (1999) identified a homozygous 1369A-T transversion
in the HSD17B4 gene, resulting in an asn457-to-tyr (N457Y) substitution.
Both patients had an isolated defect of the enoyl-CoA hydratase domain
of the D-bifunctional protein. Both patients had abnormalities of
peroxisomal beta-oxidation with elevated very long chain fatty acids and
branch chain fatty acids, but normal levels of bile acid intermediates.
Both patients were born of consanguineous parents. Sequence analysis of
the D-bifunctional protein cDNA of 15 control subjects of Caucasian
origin did not identify the N457Y mutation. Expression of the N457Y
mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae confirmed that it is the
disease-causing mutation. Immunoblot analysis of patient fibroblast
homogenates showed that the protein levels of full-length D-bifunctional
protein were strongly reduced, while the enoyl-CoA hydratase component
produced after processing within the peroxisome was undetectable,
indicating that the mutation leads to an unstable protein.

.0005
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, ARG106PRO

In a male patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Nakano et al. (2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the HSD17B4 gene: a 317G-C transversion, resulting in an
arg106-to-pro (R106P) substitution, and a 52-bp deletion (601860.0001).
The mutations were associated with complete loss of function of the
protein.

.0006
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, 138-BP DEL

In a patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515),
Ferdinandusse et al. (2002) identified a homozygous 138-bp deletion in
the HSD17B4 gene extending from basepair 145 in exon 3 through the first
63 basepairs of intron 3 of the DBP gene. This deletion resulted in
skipping of exon 3. The patient had originally been reported by
Goldfischer et al. (1986) and Schram et al. (1987) as the only patient
ever reported to have peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (604054)
deficiency. However, reanalysis showed normal thiolase and absence of
the D-bifunctional protein in brain tissue.

.0007
D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY
HSD17B4, 2-BP DEL, 422AG

In a patient with D-bifunctional protein deficiency (261515) originally
reported by Watkins et al. (1989), van Grunsven et al. (1999) identified
a homozygous 2-bp deletion (422delAG) in the HSD17B4 gene, resulting in
a premature stop codon at position 490 and a shortened protein of 163
amino acids. The patient was originally thought to have L-bifunctional
protein deficiency.

.0008
PERRAULT SYNDROME 1
HSD17B4, TYR217CYS

In 2 sisters with Perrault syndrome-1 (233400), previously described by
McCarthy and Opitz (1985) and Fiumara et al. (2004), Pierce et al.
(2010) identified compound heterozygosity for a 605A-G transition in
exon 9 of the HSD17B4 gene, resulting in a tyr217-to-cys (Y217C)
substitution in a very highly conserved region of the protein, and a
1704T-A transversion in exon 20, resulting in a tyr568-to-ter (Y568X;
601860.0009) substitution. Their unaffected mother was found to be
heterozygous for the Y217C mutation, and neither mutation was detected
in 1,092 control individuals. Expression analysis using lymphoblast cDNA
showed that Y568X transcript was expressed at very low levels relative
to the Y217C transcript, suggesting that Y568X undergoes
nonsense-mediated decay, whereas Y217C is more stably expressed.

606091	TITLE *606091 SIALIC ACID-BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE LECTIN 10; SIGLEC10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SIGLECs are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily that are expressed
on the cell surface. Most SIGLECs have 1 or more cytoplasmic immune
receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, or ITIMs. SIGLECs are
typically expressed on cells of the innate immune system, with the
exception of the B-cell expressed SIGLEC6 (604405).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences resembling CD33 (SIGLEC3;
159590) and screening a spleen cDNA library, Munday et al. (2001)
isolated a cDNA encoding SIGLEC10. Sequence analysis predicted that the
697-amino acid SIGLEC10 protein contains a signal peptide, an N-terminal
V-set Ig-like domain and 4 C2-set Ig-like domains, 5 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites, a transmembrane region, and a 126-residue
cytoplasmic tail with 3 putative ITIMs. Northern blot analysis detected
a major 3.0-kb SIGLEC10 transcript, with highest levels in spleen, lymph
node, blood leukocytes, and appendix. Little or no expression was
observed in pancreas, thyroid, and testis. Flow cytometric analysis
demonstrated eosinophil-specific expression of SIGLEC10, but at a lower
level than that of SIGLEC8 (605639). Expression was also detected on
monocytes and a CD16 (146740)-positive/CD56-negative natural killer-like
lymphocyte population. After sialidase treatment, which is necessary for
unmasking the sialic acid-binding site on SIGLECs interacting with cell
surface sialic acids, cells expressing SIGLEC10 bound to red blood
cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated expression of a 100- to
120-kD monomeric protein, higher than the predicted molecular mass,
suggesting that SIGLEC10 is glycosylated.

By random sequencing and by comparison with known SIGLEC sequences, Li
et al. (2001) independently cloned SIGLEC10 from a dendritic cell cDNA
library. The cDNA predicted a deduced 607-amino acid protein containing
3 C2-set domains and 3 putative N-glycosylation sites. Northern blot
analysis of multiple human tissues revealed a transcript of about 3.3 kb
in peripheral blood lymphocytes, ovary, and spleen, and a transcript of
about 1.8 kb in liver, spleen, thymus, and lung.

Using the positional candidate cloning approach, Yousef et al. (2001)
identified SIGLEC10 and found that it encodes 3 variants: a deduced
protein of 697 amino acids, a shorter variant missing exon 8, and a
variant with multiple combined exons including intronic sequences.
RT-PCR detected expression of SIGLEC10 primarily in bone marrow, spleen,
brain, small intestine, colon, and spinal cord.

GENE FUNCTION

With use of SIGLEC10-transfected COS-7 cells, Li et al. (2001) found
moderate red blood cell binding and rosette formation that was augmented
by sialidase pretreatment to eliminate sialylated (cis ligands) on the
COS-7 cell surface. With use of polyacrylamide glycoconjugates, they
determined that SIGLEC10 preferentially bound glycoconjugates carrying
sialic acid in either alpha-2,3 or alpha-2,6 linkages, similar to the
binding observed for SIGLEC5 (604200).

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger (cell
injury)-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) both trigger activation of
the innate immune system. Chen et al. (2009) reported that Cd24
(600074)-deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to DAMPs but
not PAMPs. CD24 associates with high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1;
163905), heat shock protein-70 (HSP70; 140550), and heat shock
protein-90 (HSP90; 140571). CD24 negatively regulates their stimulatory
activity and inhibits nuclear factor kappa-B (see 164011) activation.
Chen et al. (2009) reported that this occurs at least in part through
CD24 association with SIGLEC10 in humans or SiglecG in mice. Chen et al.
(2009) concluded that the CD24-SiglecG pathway protects the host against
a lethal response to pathologic cell death and discriminates danger-
versus pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yousef et al. (2001) determined that the SIGLEC10 gene contains 11 exons
and spans about 6.5 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Munday et al. (2001) mapped the SIGLEC10 gene to 19q13.3,
where it is closely linked to other CD33-related SIGLECs. Yousef et al.
(2001) identified the SIGLEC10 gene on overlapping BAC clones localized
to chromosome 19q13.4. SIGLEC10 lies 278 kb telomeric to SIGLEC9
(605640) and 35 kb centromeric to SIGLEC8.

612616	TITLE *612616 LATE CORNIFIED ENVELOPE PROTEIN 3D; LCE3D
;;LATE ENVELOPE PROTEIN 16; LEP16
DESCRIPTION For background information on the LCE gene cluster, see 612603.

CLONING

By database analysis to identify human orthologs of mouse genes encoding
late envelope proteins (LEPs), Marshall et al. (2001) identified LCE3D,
which they called LEP16.

Using real-time PCR, Jackson et al. (2005) detected very low LCE3D
expression in adult and fetal skin. Low expression was also detected in
internal epithelia, including vulva, tongue, and esophagus.

GENE STRUCTURE

Jackson et al. (2005) determined that LCE3D is a single-exon gene.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marshall et al. (2001) mapped the LCE3D
gene within the LCE gene cluster on chromosome 1q21. Jackson et al.
(2005) determined that the LCE3D gene is located within intron 2 of the
LCE3C gene (612615) and is oriented in the opposite direction. They
stated that the mouse Lce3d gene maps to a syntenic LCE gene cluster on
chromosome 3F1.

610637	TITLE *610637 MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED RING-CH FINGER PROTEIN 5; MARCH5
;;MARCH V
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MARCH5 is a ubiquitin ligase of the mitochondrial outer membrane that
plays a role in the control of mitochondrial morphology by regulating
mitofusin-2 (MFN2; 608507) and DRP1 (DNM1L; 603850) (Nakamura et al.,
2006).

CLONING

Poxviruses and gamma-2 herpesviruses express ubiquitin ligases called K3
proteins that inhibit the surface expression of glycoproteins, including
major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (see 142800). By
searching a database for sequences similar to the functional domains of
viral K3 proteins, Bartee et al. (2004) identified 9 human MARCH
proteins, including MARCH5. The deduced MARCH5 protein contains a short
N terminus, followed by a RING-CH domain and 4 transmembrane domains.
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that epitope-tagged MARCH5 was
expressed in an endoplasmic reticulum-like pattern.

By searching databases using MARCH2 (613332) as query, Nakamura et al.
(2006) identified MARCH5. The deduced 278-amino acid protein contains an
N-terminal RING finger and 4 C-terminal transmembrane spans. Western
blot and cell fractionation analyses showed that MARCH5 is an integral
membrane protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane.

Using RT-PCR, De Gassart et al. (2008) detected robust MARCH5 expression
in all human cells and cell lines examined, including immature and
mature dendritic cells, HeLa and B-cell lines, and monocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays, Nakamura et al. (2006)
showed that MARCH5 had ubiquitin ligase activity in the presence of
UBCH6 (UBE2E1; 602916) or UBCH9 (UBE2E3; 604151) and catalyzed
ubiquitination of DRP1. Immunofluorescence studies showed that
overexpression of MARCH5 in COS-7 cells promoted formation of aberrant,
elongated mitochondria, and mitochondrial elongation could be prevented
by coexpression of an MFN2 mutant lacking transmembrane domains.
Expression of MARCH5 with mutations in the RING finger resulted in
mitochondrial fragmentation and accumulation of punctate mitochondria in
the perinuclear region. Immunoprecipitation analysis of transfected HeLa
cells showed that MARCH5 bound endogenous MFN2 and DRP1, including
ubiquitinated DRP1 species. Nakamura et al. (2006) concluded that MARCH5
binds MFN2 and DRP1, ubiquitinates DRP1, and modifies mitochondrial
morphology.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MARCH5
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-11025).

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MTOR is a highly conserved protein kinase that is found in 2
structurally and functionally distinct protein complexes: TOR complex-1
(TORC1) and TORC2. TORC1 is a key regulator of cell growth and
proliferation and mRNA translation, whereas TORC2 promotes actin
cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell survival, and cell cycle progression
(summary by Jacinto et al. (2004) and Thoreen et al. (2012)).

CLONING

To identify the target for the FKBP12-rapamycin complex in human, Brown
et al. (1994) used a FKBP12/glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein and
glutathione affinity chromatography to purify a 220-kD bovine brain
protein which bound the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. They designed
oligonucleotide probes based on the bovine protein sequence and screened
a human Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. Their complete human cDNA for FRAP
encoded a predicted 2,549-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of approximately 300 kD. Brown et al. (1994) showed by Northern
blot analysis that the 7.6-kb gene transcript was present in a variety
of human tissues. They noted that, while the precise functions of FRAP
and its yeast homologs TOR1/TOR2 are unknown, the C-terminal regions of
these proteins share amino acid homology (approximately 21% identity on
average) with several phosphatidylinositol kinases; see 171834.

In a review, Hay and Sonenberg (2004) described the domain structure of
MTOR. The N-terminal half of the protein contains 20 tandem HEAT
repeats, which are implicated in protein-protein interactions. Each HEAT
repeat consists of 2 alpha helices of about 40 amino acids. The
C-terminal half contains a large FRAP-ATM (607585)-TRRAP (603015) (FAT)
domain, followed by the FKB12- and rapamycin-binding domain, a
serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain, a negative regulatory domain,
and a C-terminal FAT (FATC) domain necessary for MTOR activity.

GENE FUNCTION

FKBP12-rapamycin associated protein (FRAP) is one of a family of
proteins involved in cell cycle progression, DNA recombination, and DNA
damage detection. In rat, it is a 245-kD protein (symbolized RAFT1) with
significant homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein TOR1 and
has been shown to associate with the immunophilin FKBP12 (186945) in a
rapamycin-dependent fashion (Sabatini et al., 1994). Brown et al. (1994)
noted that the FKBP12-rapamycin complex was known to inhibit progression
through the G1 cell cycle stage by interfering with mitogenic signaling
pathways involved in G1 progression in several cell types, as well as in
yeast. The authors stated that the binding of FRAP to FKBP12-rapamycin
correlated with the ability of these ligands to inhibit cell cycle
progression.

Rapamycin is an efficacious anticancer agent against solid tumors. In a
hypoxic environment, the increase in mass of solid tumors is dependent
on the recruitment of mitogens and nutrients. When nutrient
concentrations change, particularly those of essential amino acids, the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR/FRAP) functions in regulatory
pathways that control ribosome biogenesis and cell growth. In bacteria,
ribosome biogenesis is independently regulated by amino acids and ATP.
Dennis et al. (2001) demonstrated that the human mTOR pathway is
influenced by the intracellular concentration of ATP, independent of the
abundance of amino acids, and that mTOR/FRAP itself is an ATP sensor.

Castedo et al. (2001) delineated the apoptotic pathway resulting from
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env)-induced
syncytia formation in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated the presence of phosphorylated ser15 of p53 (191170) as
well as the preapoptotic marker tissue transglutaminase (TGM2; 190196)
in syncytium in the apical light zone (T-cell area) of lymph nodes, as
well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, from HIV-1-positive but
not HIV-1-negative donors. The presence of these markers correlated with
viral load (HIV-1 RNA levels). Quantitative immunoblot analysis showed
that phosphorylation of ser15 of p53 in response to HIV-1 Env is
mediated by FRAP and not by other phosphatidylinositol kinase-related
kinases, and it is accompanied by downregulation of protein phosphatase
2A (see 176915). The phosphorylation is significantly inhibited by
rapamycin. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that FRAP is enriched
in syncytial nuclei and that the nuclear accumulation precedes the
phosphorylation of ser15 of p53. Castedo et al. (2001) concluded that
HIV-1 Env-induced syncytium formation leads to apoptosis via a pathway
that involves phosphorylation of ser15 of p53 by FRAP, followed by
activation of BAX (600040), mitochondrial membrane permeabilization,
release of cytochrome C, and caspase activation.

Fang et al. (2001) identified phosphatidic acid as a critical component
of mTOR signaling. In their study, mitogenic stimulation of mammalian
cells led to a phospholipase D-dependent accumulation of cellular
phosphatidic acid, which was required for activation of mTOR downstream
effectors. Phosphatidic acid directly interacted with the domain in mTOR
that is targeted by rapamycin, and this interaction was positively
correlated with mTOR's ability to activate downstream effectors. The
involvement of phosphatidic acid in mTOR signaling reveals an important
function of this lipid in signal transduction and protein synthesis, as
well as a direct link between mTOR and mitogens. Fang et al. (2001)
concluded that their study suggested a potential mechanism for the in
vivo actions of the immunosuppressant rapamycin.

Kim et al. (2002) and Hara et al. (2002) reported that MTOR binds with
RAPTOR (607130), an evolutionarily conserved protein with at least 2
roles in the MTOR pathway. Kim et al. (2002) showed that RAPTOR has a
positive role in nutrient-stimulated signaling to the downstream
effector S6K1 (608938), maintenance of cell size, and MTOR protein
expression. The association of RAPTOR with MTOR also negatively
regulates MTOR kinase activity. Conditions that repress the pathway,
such as nutrient deprivation and mitochondrial uncoupling, stabilize the
MTOR-RAPTOR association and inhibit MTOR kinase activity. Kim et al.
(2002) proposed that RAPTOR is a component of the MTOR pathway that,
through its association with MTOR, regulates cell size in response to
nutrient levels.

In mammals, MTOR cooperates with PI3K (see 171834)-dependent effectors
in a biochemical signaling pathway to regulate the size of proliferating
cells. Fingar et al. (2002) presented evidence that rat S6k1 alpha-II,
Eif4e (133440), and Eif4ebp1 (602223) mediate Mtor-dependent cell size
control.

Hara et al. (2002) showed that the binding of RAPTOR to MTOR is
necessary for the MTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation of 4EBP1 in vitro and
that it strongly enhances the MTOR kinase activity toward p70-alpha
(S6K1). Rapamycin or amino acid withdrawal increased, whereas insulin
strongly inhibited, the recovery of 4EBP1 and RAPTOR on 7-methyl-GTP
sepharose. Partial inhibition of RAPTOR expression by RNA interference
reduced MTOR-catalyzed 4EBP1 phosphorylation in vitro. RNA interference
of C. elegans Raptor yielded an array of phenotypes that closely
resembled those produced by inactivation of CE-Tor. Thus, the authors
concluded that RAPTOR is an essential scaffold for the MTOR-catalyzed
phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and mediates TOR action in vivo.

Vellai et al. (2003) demonstrated that TOR deficiency in C. elegans more
than doubles its natural life span. The absence of Let363/TOR activity
caused developmental arrest at the L3 larval stage. At 25.5 degrees C,
the mean life span of Let363 mutants was 25 days compared with a life
span of 10 days in wildtype worms.

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Kim et al. (2003) identified GBL
(612190) as an additional subunit of the MTOR signaling complex in human
embryonic kidney cells. GBL bound the kinase domain of MTOR and
stabilized the interaction of raptor with MTOR. Loss-of-function
experiments using small interfering RNA showed that, like MTOR and
raptor, GBL participated in nutrient- and growth factor-mediated
signaling to S6K1 and in control of cell size. Binding of GBL to MTOR
strongly stimulated MTOR kinase activity toward S6K1 and 4EBP1, and this
effect was reversed by stable interaction of raptor with MTOR. Nutrients
and rapamycin regulated the association of MTOR with raptor only in
complexes that also contained GBL. Kim et al. (2003) proposed that GBL
and raptor function together to modulate MTOR kinase activity.

Huntington disease (HD; 143100) is an inherited neurodegenerative
disorder caused by a polyglutamine tract expansion in which expanded
polyglutamine proteins accumulate abnormally in intracellular
aggregates. Ravikumar et al. (2004) showed that mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) is sequestered in polyglutamine aggregates in cell
models, transgenic mice, and human brains. Sequestration of mTOR impairs
its kinase activity and induces autophagy, a key clearance pathway for
mutant huntingtin (613004) fragments. This protects against
polyglutamine toxicity, as the specific mTOR inhibitor rapamycin
attenuates huntingtin accumulation and cell death in cell models of HD,
and inhibition of autophagy has converse effects. Furthermore, rapamycin
protects against neurodegeneration in a fly model of HD, and the
rapamycin analog CCI-779 improved performance on 4 different behavioral
tasks and decreased aggregate formation in a mouse model of HD. The data
provided proof of principle for the potential of inducing autophagy to
treat HD.

Scott et al. (2004) found that signaling through Tor and its upstream
regulators, Pi3k and Rheb (601293), was necessary and sufficient to
suppress starvation-induced autophagy in the Drosophila fat body. In
contrast, a downstream Tor effector, S6k, promoted rather than
suppressed autophagy, suggesting S6K downregulation may limit autophagy
during extended starvation.

Hay and Sonenberg (2004) reviewed the roles of MTOR in protein
synthesis, cell growth and proliferation, synaptic plasticity, and
cancer.

Brugarolas et al. (2004) showed that downregulation of Mtor by hypoxia
in mice required de novo transcription and expression of Redd1 (607729)
and an intact Tsc1 (605284)/Tsc2 (191092) complex.

Beuvink et al. (2005) showed that the drug RAD001 (everolimus), a
rapamycin derivative, dramatically enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis
in wildtype p53 but not mutant p53 tumor cells. The use of isogenic
tumor cell lines expressing either wildtype MTOR cDNA or an MTOR mutant
unable to bind RAD001 demonstrated that the effects of RAD001 resulted
from inhibition of MTOR function. Beuvink et al. (2005) showed that
RAD001 sensitized cells to cisplatin by inhibiting p53-induced p21
(116899) expression. This effect was attributed to a small but
significant inhibition of p21 translation, combined with the short
half-life of p21.

Kwon et al. (2003) found that inhibition of Mtor decreased the seizure
frequency and death rate in mice with conditional Pten (601728)
deficiency, prevented the increase in Pten-deficient neuronal soma size
in young mice, and reversed neuronal soma enlargement in adult mice.
Mtor inhibition did not decrease the size of wildtype adult neurons.
Kwon et al. (2003) concluded that MTOR is required for neuronal
hypertrophy downstream of PTEN deficiency, but it is not required for
maintenance of normal neuronal soma size. They proposed that MTOR
inhibitors may be useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of brain
diseases resulting from PTEN deficiency, such as Lhermitte-Duclos
disease (see 158350) or glioblastoma multiforme (137800).

Akt/PKB (164730) activation requires the phosphorylation of ser473.
Sarbassov et al. (2005) showed that in Drosophila and in human cells TOR
and its associated protein rictor are necessary for ser473
phosphorylation, and that a reduction in rictor or mTOR expression
inhibited an AKT/PKB effector. The rictor-mTOR complex directly
phosphorylated Akt/PKB on ser473 in vitro and facilitated thr308
phosphorylation by PDK1 (605213).

Holz et al. (2005) showed that MTOR and S6K1 maneuvered on and off the
EIF3 (see 602039) translation initiation complex in HEK293 cells in a
signal-dependent, choreographed fashion. When inactive, S6K1 associated
with the EIF3 complex, while the S6K1 activator MTOR, in association
with RAPTOR, did not. Hormone- or mitogen-mediated cell stimulation
promoted MTOR/RAPTOR binding to the EIF3 complex and phosphorylation of
S6K1. Phosphorylation resulted in S6K1 dissociation and activation,
followed by phosphorylation of S6K1 targets, including EIF4B (603928),
which, upon phosphorylation, was recruited into the EIF3 complex. Holz
et al. (2005) concluded that the EIF3 preinitiation complex acts as a
scaffold to coordinate responses to stimuli that promote efficient
protein synthesis.

Cota et al. (2006) demonstrated that mTOR signaling plays a role in the
brain mechanisms that respond to nutrient availability, regulating
energy balance. In the rat, mTOR signaling is controlled by energy
status in specific regions of the hypothalamus and colocalizes with
neuropeptide Y (162640) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC; 176830) neurons
in the arcuate nucleus. Central administration of leucine increases
hypothalamic mTOR signaling and decreases food intake and body weight.
The hormone leptin (164160) increases hypothalamic mTOR activity, and
the inhibition of mTOR signaling blunts leptin's anorectic effect. Thus,
Cota et al. (2006) concluded that mTOR is a cellular fuel sensor whose
hypothalamic activity is directly tied to the regulation of energy
intake.

Laviano et al. (2006) questioned the clinical validity of the
experiments performed by Cota et al. (2006) given that in human
conditions such as hepatic encephalopathy and cancer, and in
malnourished uremic patients undergoing hemodialysis, supplementation
with 7 grams per day of leucine, which comprises 50% of a branched-chain
amino acid mix, improves appetite and muscle protein synthesis. Cota et
al. (2006) responded that their experiments were done in healthy rats of
normal weight to investigate the physiologic role of hypothalamic mTOR
in the regulation of food intake.

Bernardi et al. (2006) identified PML (102578) as a critical inhibitor
of neoangiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) in vivo, in both
ischemic and neoplastic conditions, through the control of protein
translation. Bernardi et al. (2006) demonstrated that in hypoxic
conditions PML acts as a negative regulator of the synthesis rate of
hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A; 603348) by repressing mTOR. PML
physically interacts with mTOR and negatively regulates its association
with the small GTPase RHEB (601293) by favoring mTOR nuclear
accumulation. Notably, PML-null cells and tumors displayed higher
sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo to growth inhibition by rapamycin,
and lack of PML inversely correlated with phosphorylation of ribosomal
protein S6 (180460) and tumor angiogenesis in mouse and human tumors.
Thus, Bernardi et al. (2006) concluded that their findings identified
PML as a novel suppressor of mTOR and neoangiogenesis.

Li et al. (2006) demonstrated that Tor1 is dynamically distributed in
the cytoplasm and nucleus in yeast. Tor1 nuclear localization is
nutrient-dependent and rapamycin-sensitive: starvation or treatment with
rapamycin causes Tor1 to exit from the nucleus. Tor1 nuclear
localization is critical for 35S rRNA synthesis, but not for the
expression of amino acid transporters and ribosomal protein genes. Li et
al. (2006) further showed that Tor1 is associated with 35S ribosomal DNA
(rDNA) promoter chromatin in a rapamycin- and starvation-sensitive
manner; this association is necessary for 35S rRNA synthesis and cell
growth. Li et al. (2006) concluded that the spatial regulation of Tor1
complex 1 (TORC1; see later) might be involved in differential control
of its target genes.

Raab-Graham et al. (2006) found that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin
increased the Kv1.1 (KCNA1; 176260) voltage-gated potassium channel
protein in hippocampal neurons and promoted Kv1.1 surface expression on
dendrites without altering its axonal expression. Moreover, endogenous
Kv1.1 mRNA was detected in dendrites. Using Kv1.1 fused to the
photoconvertible fluorescence protein Kaede as a reporter for local
synthesis, Raab-Graham et al. (2006) observed Kv1.1 synthesis in
dendrites upon inhibition of mTOR or the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
glutamate receptor (see 138251). Thus, Raab-Graham et al. (2006)
concluded that synaptic excitation may cause local suppression of
dendritic Kv1 channels by reducing their local synthesis.

Hoyer-Hansen et al. (2007) showed that Ca(2+)-induced autophagy in
mammalian cells utilized a signaling pathway that included CAMKK2, AMPK
(PRKAA2; 600497), and mTOR. Ca(2+)-induced autophagy was inhibited by
BCL2 (151430) but only when BCL2 was localized to the endoplasmic
reticulum.

The activity of mTOR is regulated by RHEB, a Ras-like small GTPase, in
response to growth factor stimulation and nutrient availability. Bai et
al. (2007) showed that RHEB regulates mTOR through FKBP38 (604840), a
member of the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) family that is structurally
related to FKBP12 (186945). FKBP38 binds to mTOR and inhibits its
activity in a manner similar to that of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex.
RHEB interacts directly with FKBP38 and prevents its association with
mTOR in a GTP-dependent manner. Bai et al. (2007) concluded that their
findings suggested that FKBP38 is an endogenous inhibitor of mTOR, whose
inhibitory activity is antagonized by RHEB in response to growth factor
stimulation and nutrient availability.

Cunningham et al. (2007) showed that mTOR is necessary for the
maintenance of mitochondrial oxidative function. In skeletal muscle
tissues and cells, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin decreased the gene
expression of the mitochondrial transcriptional regulators PGC1-alpha
(604517), estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA; 601998), and nuclear
respiratory factors, resulting in a decrease in mitochondrial gene
expression and oxygen consumption. Using computational genomics,
Cunningham et al. (2007) identified the transcription factor yin-yang 1
(YY1; 600013) as a common target of mTOR and PGC1-alpha. Knockdown of
YY1 caused a significant decrease in mitochondrial gene expression and
in respiration, and YY1 was required for rapamycin-dependent repression
of those genes. Moreover, inhibition of mTOR resulted in a failure of
YY1 to interact with and be coactivated by PGC1-alpha. Cunningham et al.
(2007) concluded that they identified a mechanism by which a nutrient
sensor (mTOR) balances energy metabolism by means of the transcriptional
control of mitochondrial oxidative function.

Mao et al. (2008) demonstrated that mTOR is targeted for ubiquitination
and consequent degradation by binding to the tumor suppressor protein
FBXW7 (606278). Human breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors showed
a reciprocal relation between loss of FBXW7 and deletion or mutation of
PTEN (601728), which also activates mTOR. Tumor cell lines harboring
deletions or mutations in FBXW7 are particularly sensitive to rapamycin
treatment, suggesting to Mao et al. (2008) that loss of FBXW7 may be a
biomarker for human cancers susceptible to treatment with inhibitors of
the mTOR pathway.

To test for the role of intrinsic impediments to axon regrowth, Park et
al. (2008) analyzed cell growth control genes using a virus-assisted in
vivo conditional knockout approach. Deletion of PTEN, a negative
regulator of the mTOR pathway, in adult retinal ganglion cells promoted
robust axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. In wildtype adult
mice, the mTOR activity was suppressed and new protein synthesis was
impaired in axotomized retinal ganglion cells, which may have
contributed to the regeneration failure. Reactivating this pathway by
conditional knockout of the TSC1 gene (605284), another negative
regulator of the mTOR pathway, also led to axon regeneration.

Genomewide copy number analyses of human cancers identified a frequent
5p13 amplification in several solid tumor types, including lung (56%),
ovarian (38%), breast (32%), prostate (37%), and melanoma (32%). Using
integrative analysis of a genomic profile of the region, Scott et al.
(2009) identified a Golgi protein, GOLPH3 (612207), as a candidate
targeted for amplification. Gain- and loss-of-function studies in vitro
and in vivo validated GOLPH3 as a potent oncogene. Physically, GOLPH3
localizes to the trans-Golgi network and interacts with components of
the retromer complex, which in yeast has been linked to TOR signaling.
Mechanistically, GOLPH3 regulates cell size, enhances growth
factor-induced mTOR signaling in human cancer cells, and alters the
response of an mTOR inhibitor in vivo. Thus, Scott et al. (2009)
concluded that genomic and genetic, biologic, functional, and
biochemical data in yeast and humans established GOLPH3 as a novel
oncogene that is commonly targeted for amplification in human cancer,
and is capable of modulating the response to rapamycin, a cancer drug in
clinical use.

Mutations in the TSC1 (605284) and TSC2 (191092) genes cause tuberous
sclerosis (191100 and 613254, respectively); the protein products of
these genes form a complex in the TOR pathway that integrates
environmental signals to regulate cell growth, proliferation, and
survival. DiBella et al. (2009) showed that morpholino knockdown of
zebrafish Tsc1a led to a ciliary phenotype including kidney cyst
formation and left-right asymmetry defects. Tsc1a localized to the
Golgi, but morpholinos against it, nonetheless, acted synthetically with
ciliary genes in producing kidney cysts. Consistent with a role of the
cilium in the same pathway as Tsc genes, the TOR pathway was found to be
aberrantly activated in ciliary mutants, resembling the effect of Tsc1a
knockdown, and kidney cyst formation in ciliary mutants was blocked by
rapamycin. DiBella et al. (2009) suggested a signaling network between
the cilium and the TOR pathway wherein ciliary signals can feed into the
TOR pathway and where Tsc1a may regulate the length of the cilium
itself.

Araki et al. (2009) demonstrated that mTOR is a major regulator of
memory CD8 T-cell differentiation and that the immunosuppressive drug
rapamycin has immunostimulatory effects on the generation of memory CD8
T cells. Treatment of mice with rapamycin following acute lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus infection enhanced not only the quantity but also
the quality of virus-specific CD8 T cells. Similar effects were seen
after immunization of mice with a vaccine based on nonreplicating
virus-like particles. In addition, rapamycin treatment also enhanced
memory T-cell responses in nonhuman primates following vaccination with
modified vaccinia virus Ankara. Rapamycin was effective during both the
expansion and contraction phases of the T cell response; during the
expansion phase it increased the number of memory precursors, and during
the contraction phase (effector to memory transition) it accelerated the
memory T cell differentiation program. Experiments using RNA
interference to inhibit expression of mTOR, raptor (607130) or FKBP12
(186945) in antigen-specific CD8 T cells showed that mTOR acts
intrinsically through the mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1; see later) pathway to
regulate memory T-cell differentiation. Araki et al. (2009) concluded
that their studies identified a molecular pathway to regulate memory
T-cell differentiation and provided a strategy for improving the
functional qualities of vaccine- or infection-induced memory T cells.

Sestrins (see 606103) are conserved proteins that accumulate in cells
exposed to stress, potentiate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
kinase (AMPK; 602739), and inhibit activation of TOR (mTOR). Lee et al.
(2010) showed that the abundance of Drosophila sestrin is increased upon
chronic TOR activation through accumulation of reactive oxygen species
that cause activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (see 601158) and
transcription factor Forkhead box O (Foxo; see 136533). Loss of
Drosophila Sesn resulted in age-associated pathologies including
triglyceride accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, muscle
degeneration, and cardiac malfunction, which were prevented by
pharmacologic activation of AMPK or inhibition of TOR. Hence, Lee et al.
(2010) concluded that Drosophila Sesn appears to be a negative feedback
regulator of TOR that integrates metabolic and stress inputs and
prevents pathologies caused by chronic TOR activation that may result
from diminished autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria, protein
aggregates, or lipids.

Using naive CD8 T (OT-I) cells from Rag2 (179616) -/- mice, Rao et al.
(2010) showed that IL12 (161560) enhanced and sustained antigen and B7.1
(CD80; 112203) costimulatory molecule-induced mTor kinase activity via
Pi3k and Stat4 (600558) pathways. Blocking mTor activity with rapamycin
reversed IL12-induced effector functions through loss of Tbet (TBX21;
604895) expression. Rapamycin treatment of IL12-conditioned OT-I cells
also induced Eomes (604615) expression and memory T cell precursors with
greater antitumor efficacy. Rao et al. (2010) concluded that mTOR is the
central regulator of transcriptional programs determining effector
and/or memory cell fates of CD8+ T cells.

Yu et al. (2010) showed that mTOR signaling in rat kidney cells is
inhibited during initiation of autophagy, but reactivated by prolonged
starvation. Reactivation of mTOR is autophagy-dependent and requires the
degradation of autolysosomal products. Increased mTOR activity
attenuates autophagy and generates protolysosomal tubules and vesicles
that extrude from autolysosomes and ultimately mature into functional
lysosomes, thereby restoring the full complement of lysosomes in the
cell--a process Yu et al. (2010) identified in multiple animal species.
Thus, Yu et al. (2010) concluded that an evolutionarily conserved cycle
in autophagy governs nutrient sensing and lysosome homeostasis during
starvation.

Ketamine results in a rapid antidepressant response after administration
in treatment-resistant depressed patients. Li et al. (2010) observed
that ketamine rapidly activated the mTOR pathway, leading to increased
synaptic signaling proteins and increased number and function of new
spine synapses in the prefrontal cortex of rats. Moreover, blockade of
mTOR signaling completely blocked ketamine induction of synaptogenesis
and behavioral responses in models of depression. Li et al. (2010)
concluded that these effects of ketamine are opposite to the synaptic
deficits that result from exposure to stress and could contribute to the
fast antidepressant actions of ketamine. Furthermore, Li et al. (2010)
demonstrated that another compound, which selectively acts on NR2B
(138252), had similar effects to ketamine, suggesting that this effect
is mediated through NMDA receptors.

Sathaliyawala et al. (2010) found that the Mtor inhibitor rapamycin
impaired mouse Flt3l (FLT3LG; 600007)-driven dendritic cell (DC)
development in vitro, with plasmacytoid DCs and classical DCs most
profoundly affected. Depletion of the Pi3k-Mtor negative regulator Pten
facilitated Flt3l-driven DC development in culture. Targeting Pten in
DCs in vivo caused expansion of Cd8-positive and Cd103 (ITGAE;
604682)-positive classical DCs, which could be reversed by rapamycin.
Increased Cd8-positive classical DC numbers caused by Pten deletion
correlated with increased susceptibility to Listeria infection.
Sathaliyawala et al. (2010) concluded that PI3K-MTOR signaling
downstream of FLT3L controls DC development, and that restriction by
PTEN ensures optimal DC numbers and subset composition.

Protein synthesis and autophagic degradation are regulated in an
opposite manner by mTOR, whereas under certain conditions it would be
beneficial if they occurred in unison to handle rapid protein turnover.
Narita et al. (2011) observed a distinct cellular compartment at the
trans side of the Golgi apparatus, the TOR-autophagy spatial coupling
compartment (TASCC), where (auto)lysosomes and mTOR accumulated during
Ras-induced senescence. mTOR recruitment to the TASCC was amino acid-
and Rag guanosine triphosphatase (e.g., 612194)-dependent, and
disruption of mTOR localization to the TASCC suppressed interleukin-6/8
(147620/146930) synthesis. TASCC formation was observed during
macrophage differentiation and in glomerular podocytes; both displayed
increased protein secretion. Narita et al. (2011) concluded that the
spatial coupling of cells' catabolic and anabolic machinery could
augment their respective functions and facilitate the mass synthesis of
secretory proteins.

Using ribosome profiling, Hsieh et al. (2012) uncovered specialized
translation of the prostate cancer genome by oncogenic mTOR signaling,
revealing a remarkably specific repertoire of genes involved in cell
proliferation, metabolism, and invasion. Hsieh et al. (2012) extended
these findings by functionally characterizing a class of translationally
controlled proinvasion mRNAs that direct prostate cancer invasion and
metastatis downstream of oncogenic mTOR signaling. Hsieh et al. (2012)
developed a clinically relevant ATP site inhibitor of mTOR, called
INK128, which reprograms this gene expression signature with therapeutic
benefit for prostate cancer metastasis.

- MTOR Complexes 1 and 2

Jacinto et al. (2004) identified 2 distinct mammalian TOR complexes:
TORC1, which contains TOR, LST8 (612190), and RAPTOR (607130), and
TORC2, which contains TOR, LST8, and RICTOR (609022), which they called
AVO3. Like yeast TORC2, mammalian TORC2 was rapamycin-insensitive and
functioned upstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin cytoskeleton.
TORC2 did not regulate S6K (see 608938) activity. Knockdown of TORC2,
but not TORC1, prevented paxillin (602505) phosphorylation, actin
polymerization, and cell spreading.

Sarbassov et al. (2004) identified a RICTOR (609022)-containing MTOR
complex that contains GBL (LST8) but not RAPTOR. The RICTOR-MTOR complex
did not regulate the MTOR effector S6K1 and was not bound by FKBP12
(186945)-rapamycin. Rapamycin treatment of human embryonic kidney cells
eliminated the binding of MTOR to RAPTOR, but did not affect the
interaction of MTOR with RICTOR. Knockdown of RICTOR caused accumulation
of thick actin fibers throughout much of the cytoplasm in HeLa cells,
loss of actin at the cell cortex, altered distribution of cytoskeletal
proteins, and reduced protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha (see 176960)
activity. Sarbassov et al. (2004) concluded that the RICTOR-MTOR complex
modulates the phosphorylation of PKC-alpha and the actin cytoskeleton,
similar to TOR signaling in yeast.

The multiprotein mTORC1 protein kinase complex is the central component
of a pathway that promotes growth in response to insulin, energy levels,
and amino acids and is deregulated in common cancers. Sancak et al.
(2008) found that the Rag proteins, a family of 4 related small
guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) (RAGA, 612194; RAGB, 300725; RAGC,
608267; and RAGD, 608268), interact with mTORC1 in an amino
acid-sensitive manner and are necessary for the activation of the mTORC1
pathway by amino acids. A Rag mutant that was constitutively bound to
guanosine triphosphate interacted strongly with mTORC1, and its
expression within cells made the mTORC1 pathway resistant to amino acid
deprivation. Conversely, expression of a guanosine diphosphate-bound Rag
mutant prevented stimulation of mTORC1 by amino acids. Sancak et al.
(2008) concluded that the Rag proteins do not directly stimulate the
kinase activity of mTORC1, but, like amino acids, promote the
intracellular localization of mTOR to a compartment that also contains
its activator RHEB (601293).

Dowling et al. (2010) inhibited the mTORC1 pathway in cells lacking the
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding proteins EIF4EBP1
(602223), EIF4EBP2 (602224), and EIF4EBP3 (603483) and analyzed the
effects on cell size, cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression.
Although the EIF4EBPs had no effect on cell size, they inhibited cell
proliferation by selectively inhibiting the translation of mRNAs that
encode proliferation-promoting proteins and proteins involved in cell
cycle progression. Thus, Dowling et al. (2010) concluded that control of
cell size and cell cycle progression appear to be independent in
mammalian cells, whereas in lower eukaryotes, EIF4E binding proteins
influence both cell growth and proliferation.

Rosner et al. (2009) reported that the mTORC1-mediated consequences on
cell cycle and cell size were separable and did not involve effects on
mTORC2 activity. However, mTORC2 itself was a potent regulator of
mammalian cell size and cell cycle via a mechanism involving the Akt
(see 164730)/TSC2 (191092)/Rheb (601293) cascade.

Heublein et al. (2010) stated that path, a Drosophila amino acid
transporter, functions in nutrient-dependent growth via MTORC1. They
showed that the human orthologs of path, PAT1 (SLC36A1; 606561) and PAT4
(SLC36A4; 613760), had similar growth regulatory functions when
expressed in flies. Knockdown of PAT1 or PAT4 in human MCF-7 breast
cancer cells or HEK293 cells via small interfering RNA inhibited cell
proliferation without affecting cell survival, similar to the effect of
MTOR knockdown. Knockdown of PAT1, PAT4, or MTOR reduced phosphorylation
of the MTORC1 targets S6K1, S6, and 4EBP1, but had a much smaller effect
on signaling through PI3K and AKT and had no effect on MTORC2. Knockdown
of PAT1, PAT4, or MTOR in serum- and nutrient-starved cells reduced
amino acid-dependent MTORC1 signaling following refeeding. Conversely,
overexpression of PAT1 in starved cells enhanced the sensitivity of the
MTORC1 response to amino acids during refeeding. Heublein et al. (2010)
hypothesized that PAT1 and PAT4 participate in amino acid sensing and
contribute to the MTORC1 response to amino acids.

Sengupta et al. (2010) showed that mTORC1 controls ketogenesis in mice
in response to fasting. The authors found that liver-specific loss of
TSC1 (605284), an mTORC1 inhibitor, led to a fasting-resistant increase
in liver size, and to a pronounced defect in ketone body production and
ketogenic gene expression on fasting. The loss of raptor (607130), an
essential mTORC1 component, had the opposite effect. In addition,
Sengupta et al. (2010) found that the inhibition of mTORC1 is required
for the fasting-induced activation of PPAR-alpha (170998) and that
suppression of NCoR1 (600849), a corepressor of PPAR-alpha, reactivates
ketogenesis in cells and livers with hyperactive mTORC1 signaling. Like
livers with activated mTORC1, livers from aged mice have a defect in
ketogenesis, which correlates with an increase in mTORC1 signaling.
Moreover, Sengupta et al. (2010) showed that suppressive effects of
mTORC1 activation and aging on PPAR-alpha activity and ketone production
are not additive, and that mTORC1 inhibition is sufficient to prevent
the aging-induced defect in ketogenesis. Thus, Sengupta et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings revealed that mTORC1 is a key regulator of
PPAR-alpha function and hepatic ketogenesis and suggested a role for
mTORC1 activity in promoting the aging of the liver.

Hsu et al. (2011) defined the mTOR-regulated phosphoproteome by
quantitative mass spectrometry and characterized the primary sequence
motif specificity of mTOR using positional scanning peptide libraries.
Hsu et al. (2011) found that the phosphorylation response to insulin is
largely mTOR-dependent and that mTOR exhibits a unique preference for
proline, hydrophobic, and aromatic residues at the +1 position. The
adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein-10 (GRB10; 601523)
was identified as an mTORC1 substrate that mediates the inhibition of
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K; see 171834) typical of cells lacking
tuberous sclerosis complex-2 (TSC2; 191092), a tumor suppressor and
negative regulator of mTORC1.

Yu et al. (2011) used large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics
experiments to define the signaling networks downstream of mTORC1 and
mTORC2. Characterization of an mTORC1 substrate, Grb10, showed that
mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation stabilized Grb10, leading to feedback
inhibition of the PI3K and extracellular
signal-regulated/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK; see 176872)
pathways. Grb10 expression is frequently downregulated in various
cancers, and loss of Grb10 and loss of the well-established tumor
suppressor phosphatase PTEN (601728) appear to be mutually exclusive
events, suggesting that Grb10 might be a tumor suppressor regulated by
mTORC1.

Amino acids activate the Rag GTPases, which promote the translocation of
mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, the site of mTORC1 activation. Zoncu et
al. (2011) found that the vacuolar hydrogen proton-adenosine
triphosphatase ATPase (v-ATPase; see 607027) is necessary for amino
acids to activate mTORC1. The v-ATPase engages in extensive amino
acid-sensitive interactions with the Ragulator, a scaffolding complex
that anchors the Rag GTPases to the lysosome. In a cell-free system, ATP
hydrolysis by the v-ATPase was necessary for amino acids to regulate the
v-ATPase-Ragulator interaction and promote mTORC1 translocation. The
results obtained in vitro and in human cells suggested that amino acid
signaling begins within the lysosomal lumen. Zoncu et al. (2011)
concluded that their results identified the v-ATPase as a component of
the mTOR pathway and delineated a lysosome-associated machinery for
amino acid sensing.

Yilmaz et al. (2012) found that Paneth cells, a key constituent of the
mammalian intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche, augment stem cell function
in response to calorie restriction. Calorie restriction acts by reducing
mTORC1 signaling in Paneth cells, and the ISC-enhancing effects of
calorie restriction can be mimicked by rapamycin. Calorie intake
regulates mTORC1 in Paneth cells, but not ISCs, and forced activation of
mTORC1 in Paneth cells during calorie restriction abolishes the
ISC-augmenting effects of the niche. Finally, increased expression of
bone stromal antigen-1 (BST1; 600387), an ectoenzyme that produces the
paracrine factor cyclic ADP ribose, in Paneth cells mediates the effects
of calorie restriction and rapamycin on ISC function. Yilmaz et al.
(2012) concluded that their findings established that mTORC1
non-cell-autonomously regulates stem cell self-renewal, and highlighted
a significant role of the mammalian intestinal niche in coupling stem
cell function to organismal physiology.

Thoreen et al. (2012) used high-resolution transcriptome-scale ribosome
profiling to monitor translation in mouse cells acutely treated with the
mTOR inhibitor Torin-1, which, unlike rapamycin, fully inhibits mTORC1.
Their data revealed a surprisingly simple model of the mRNA features and
mechanisms that confer mTORC1-dependent translation control. The subset
of mRNAs that are specifically regulated by mTORC1 consists almost
entirely of transcripts with established 5-prime terminal
oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, or, like Hsp90ab1 (140572) and Ybx1
(154030), with previously unrecognized TOP or related TOP-like motifs
that were identified. Thoreen et al. (2012) found no evidence to support
proposals that mTORC1 preferentially regulates mRNAs with increased
5-prime untranslated region length or complexity. mTORC1 phosphorylates
a myriad of translational regulators, but how it controls TOP mRNA
translation was unknown. Remarkably, loss of just the E4-BP family of
translational repressors, arguably the best characterized mTORC1
substrates, is sufficient to render TOP and TOP-like mRNA translation
resistant to Torin-1. The 4E-BPs inhibit translation initiation by
interfering with the interaction between the cap-binding protein eIF4E
(133440) and eIF4G1 (600495). Loss of this interaction diminishes the
capacity of eIF4E to bind TOP and TOP-like mRNAs much more than other
mRNAs, explaining why mTOR inhibition selectively suppresses their
translation.

Efeyan et al. (2013) generated knock-in mice that express a
constitutively active form of RagA (612194), RagA(GTP), from its
endogenous promoter. RagA(GTP/GTP) homozygous mice developed normally
but failed to survive postnatal day 1. When delivered by cesarean
section, fasted RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates die almost twice as rapidly as
wildtype littermates. Within an hour of birth wildtype neonates strongly
inhibit mTORC1, which coincides with profound hypoglycemia and a
decrease in plasma amino acid concentrations. In contrast, mTORC1
inhibition does not occur in RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates, despite identical
reductions in blood nutrient amounts. With prolonged fasting, wildtype
neonates recover their plasma glucose concentrations, but RagA(GTP/GTP)
mice remain hypoglycemic until death, despite using glycogen at a faster
rate. The glucose homeostasis defect correlates with the inability of
fasted RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates to trigger autophagy and produce amino
acids for de novo glucose production. Because profound hypoglycemia does
not inhibit mTORC1 in RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates, Efeyan et al. (2013)
considered the possibility that the Rag pathway signals glucose as well
as amino acid sufficiency to mTORC1. Indeed, mTORC1 is resistant to
glucose deprivation in RagA(GTP/GTP) fibroblasts, and glucose, like
amino acids, controls its recruitment to the lysosomal surface, the site
of mTORC1 activation. Thus, the Rag GTPases signal glucose and amino
acid concentrations to mTORC1, and have an unexpectedly key role in
neonates in autophagy induction and thus nutrient homeostasis and
viability.

Robitaille et al. (2013) used quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify
substrates or downstream effectors of the 2 mTOR complexes. mTOR
controlled the phosphorylation of 335 proteins, including CAD (carbamoyl
phosphate synthetase-2/aspartate transcarbamoylase/ dihydroorotase;
114010). The trifunctional CAD protein catalyzes the first 3 steps in de
novo pyrimidine synthesis. mTORC1 indirectly phosphorylated CAD-S1859
through S6 kinase (S6K; see RPSKB1, 608938). CAD-S1859 phosphorylation
promoted CAD oligomerization and thereby stimulated de novo synthesis of
pyrimidines and progression through S phase of the cell cycle in
mammalian cells. Ben-Sahra et al. (2013) independently showed that
activation of mTORC1 led to the acute stimulation of metabolic flux
through the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. mTORC1 signaling
posttranslationally regulated this metabolic pathway via its downstream
target S6K1, which directly phosphorylates S1859 on CAD. Growth
signaling through mTORC1 thus stimulates the production of new
nucleotides to accommodate an increase in RNA and DNA synthesis needed
for ribosome biogenesis and anabolic growth.

Zeng et al. (2013) demonstrated that mTORC1 signaling is a pivotal
positive determinant of regulatory T cell (Treg) function in mice. Tregs
have elevated steady-state mTORC1 activity compared to naive T cells.
Signals through the T cell antigen receptor (TCR; see 186880) and
interleukin-2 (IL2; 147680) provide major inputs for mTORC1 activation,
which in turn programs the suppressive function of Tregs. Disruption of
mTORC1 through Treg-specific deletion of the essential component raptor
(607130) leads to a profound loss of Treg-suppressive activity in vivo
and the development of a fatal early-onset inflammatory disorder.
Mechanistically, raptor/mTORC1 signaling in Tregs promotes cholesterol
and lipid metabolism, with the mevalonate pathway particularly important
for coordinating Treg proliferation and upregulation of the suppressive
molecules CTLA4 (123890) and ICOS (604558) to establish Treg functional
competency. By contrast, mTORC1 does not directly affect the expression
of Foxp3 (300292) or anti- and proinflammatory cytokines in Treg cells,
suggesting a nonconventional mechanism for Treg functional regulation.
Finally, Zeng et al. (2013) provided evidence that mTORC1 maintains Treg
function partly through inhibiting the mTORC2 pathway. Zeng et al.
(2013) concluded that their results showed that mTORC1 acts as a
fundamental rheostat in Tregs to link immunologic signals from TCR and
IL2 to lipogenic pathways and functional fitness, and highlighted a
central role of metabolic programming of Treg suppressive activity in
immune homeostasis and tolerance.

Loss of MTM1 (300415), a phosphatase that can dephosphorylate
PtdIns(3)P, causes X-linked myotubular myopathy (310400) in humans and
in the Mtm1 -/- mouse model. Fetalvero et al. (2013) found that mTORC1
activity was inhibited in Mtm1 -/- mouse skeletal muscle, concomitant
with increased content of PtdIns(3)P, ubiquitinated proteins, and
lipidated proteins normally degraded via autophagy. Mtm1 -/- muscle also
showed accumulation of defective mitochondria with decreased COX enzyme
activity. No change in mTORC1, mitochondria, or content of nondegraded
proteins was observed in liver, heart, or brain of Mtm1 -/- mice.
Overnight fasting activated mTORC1-dependent inhibition of autophagy in
wildtype, but not Mtm1 -/-, skeletal muscle. Inhibition of
hyperactivated mTORC1 normalized autophagy and rescued muscle mass in
Mtm1 -/- mice. Fetalvero et al. (2013) concluded that MTM1 is involved
in the regulation of mTORC1 and autophagy specifically in skeletal
muscle.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Yang et al. (2013) reported cocrystal structures of a complex of
truncated mTOR and mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein-8 (mLST8; 612190)
with an ATP transition state mimic and with ATP-site inhibitors. The
structures revealed an intrinsically active kinase conformation, with
catalytic residues and a catalytic mechanism remarkably similar to
canonical protein kinases. The active site is highly recessed owing to
the FKBP12 (186945)-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain and an inhibitory
helix protruding from the catalytic cleft. mTOR-activating mutations map
to the structural framework that holds these elements in place,
indicating that the kinase is controlled by restricted access. In vitro
biochemistry showed that the FRB domain acts as a gatekeeper, with its
rapamycin-binding site interacting with substrates to grant them access
to the restricted active site. Rapamycin-FKBP12 inhibits the kinase by
directly blocking substrate recruitment and by further restricting
active-site access. Yang et al. (2013) concluded that the structures
also revealed active-site residues and conformational changes that
underlie inhibitor potency and specificity.

PATHOGENESIS

- Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors

Jiao et al. (2011) explored the genetic basis of pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) by determining the exomic sequence of 10
nonfamilial PanNETs and then screened the most commonly mutated genes in
58 additional PanNETs. Jiao et al. (2011) found mutations in genes in
the mTOR pathway in 14% of the tumors, a finding that could potentially
be used to stratify patients for treatments with mTOR inhibitors. The
most frequently mutated genes specify proteins implicated in chromatin
remodeling: 44% of the tumors had somatic inactivating mutations in MEN1
(613733), and 43% had mutations in genes encoding either of the 2
subunits of a transcription/chromatin remodeling complex consisting of
DAXX (603186) and ATRX (300032). Clinically, mutations in the MEN1 and
DAXX/ATRX genes were associated with better prognosis.

MAPPING

Moore et al. (1996) assigned the FRAP gene to chromosome 1p36 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Lench et al. (1997) mapped
the FRAP gene to 1p36.2 by FISH following radiation-hybrid mapping to
that general region. Chromosome 1p36.2 is the region most consistently
deleted in neuroblastomas. Given the role of PIK-related kinase proteins
in DNA repair, recombination, and cell cycle checkpoints, the authors
suggested that the possible role of FRAP in solid tumors with deletions
at 1p36 should be investigated. Onyango et al. (1998) established the
order of genes in the 1p36 region, telomere to centromere, as CDC2L1
(176873)--PTPRZ2 (604008)--ENO1 (172430)--PGD (172200)--XBX1--FRAP2
(FRAP1)--CD30 (153243).

ANIMAL MODEL

Murakami et al. (2004) generated mTor-knockout mice by disrupting the
kinase domain of mouse mTor and found that mTor +/- mice were normal and
fertile, but that mTor -/- mice exhibited embryonic lethality shortly
after implantation. Although homozygous blastocysts appeared normal,
their inner cell mass and trophoblast did not proliferate in vitro.
Mutation analysis showed that the 6 C-terminal amino acids of mTOR are
essential for kinase activity and are necessary for normal cell size and
proliferation in embryonic stem cells. Murakami et al. (2004) concluded
that mTOR controls both cell size and proliferation in early mouse
embryos and embryonic stem cells. Independently, Gangloff et al. (2004)
observed defects in mTor -/- mice but not in mTor +/- mice confirming
the findings of Murakami et al. (2004).

By generating mice with a deletion of mTor specifically in T
lymphocytes, Delgoffe et al. (2009) demonstrated that mTor activation is
not necessary for normal activation and IL2 (147680) secretion but is
necessary for Th1 (see IFNG, 147570), Th2 (see IL4, 147780), and Th17
(see IL17, 603149) differentiation. Under fully activating conditions,
mTor-null T cells differentiated into Foxp3 (300292)-positive regulatory
T cells. This differentiation was associated with hyperactive Smad3
(603109) activation in the absence of exogenous Tgfb (190180). T cells
lacking the Torc1 protein complex did not divert to a regulatory
pathway, thus implicating both Torc1 and Torc2 in preventing the
generation of regulatory T cells. Delgoffe et al. (2009) suggested that
MTOR kinase signaling regulates the commitment to effector or regulatory
T cell lineages.

Harrison et al. (2009) found that rapamycin feeding increased both
median and maximum life span in genetically heterogeneous mice, even
when started late in life. The effect was observed in both male and
female mice and occurred in the absence of diet restriction or reduction
in body weight. Rapamycin did not change the distribution of presumptive
causes of death.

N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are lipid-derived signaling molecules, which
include the mammalian endocannabinoid arachidonoyl ethanolamide. Given
its involvement in regulating nutrient intake and energy balance, the
endocannabinoid system is an excellent candidate for a metabolic signal
that coordinates the organismal response to dietary restriction and
maintains homeostasis when nutrients are limited. Lucanic et al. (2011)
identified NAEs in C. elegans and showed that NAE abundance is reduced
under dietary restriction and that NAE deficiency is sufficient to
extend life span through a dietary restriction mechanism requiring PHA4,
a homolog of FOXA1 (602294). Conversely, dietary supplementation with
the nematode NAE eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide not only inhibited
dietary restriction-induced life span extension in wildtype worms, but
also suppressed life span extension in a TOR pathway mutant. Lucanic et
al. (2011) concluded that their study demonstrated a role for NAE
signaling in aging and indicated that NAEs represent a signal that
coordinates nutrient status with metabolic changes that ultimately
determine life span.

Calorie restriction, which increases life span and insulin sensitivity,
is proposed to function by inhibition of mTORC1, yet paradoxically,
chronic administration of rapamycin substantially impairs glucose
tolerance and insulin action. Lamming et al. (2012) demonstrated that
rapamycin disrupted a second mTOR complex, mTORC2, in vivo and that
mTORC2 was required for the insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic
gluconeogenesis. Further, decreased mTORC1 signaling was sufficient to
extend life span independently from changes in glucose homeostasis, as
female mice heterozygous for both mTOR and mLST8 (612190) exhibited
decreased mTORC1 activity and extended life span but had normal glucose
tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Thus, Lamming et al. (2012) concluded
that mTORC2 disruption is an important mediator of the effects of
rapamycin in vivo.

Cina et al. (2012) targeted Mtor disruption to mouse podocytes. Mutant
mice developed proteinuria at 3 weeks and end stage renal failure by 5
weeks after birth. Podocytes from mutant mice exhibited accumulation of
autophagosomes, autophagolysosomal vesicles, and damaged mitochondria.
Similarly, human podocytes treated with rapamycin accumulated
autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes.

HISTORY

Crino (2008) noted that rapamycin was discovered in the 1970s as a
macrolide antibiotic and antifungal in a soil sample from Rapa Nui, also
known as Easter Island.

602409	TITLE *602409 MYELOID/LYMPHOID OR MIXED LINEAGE LEUKEMIA, TRANSLOCATED TO, 10; MLLT10
;;ALL1-FUSED GENE FROM CHROMOSOME 10; AF10
AF10/MLL FUSION GENE, INCLUDED;;
AF10/HEAB FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Translocations affecting chromosome 11q23 involve many partner
chromosome regions and occur in various leukemias (see 600328). The
11q23 gene involved in the translocations is MLL (159555). Using RACE to
identify MLL fusion transcripts in RNA from 2 leukemia patients, Chaplin
et al. (1995) identified the partner gene involved in t(10;11)(p12;q23)
translocations. In both patients, the translocation fused MLL to a gene
that the authors designated AF10. The AF10 gene encodes a predicted
1,027-amino acid protein containing an N-terminal zinc finger and a
C-terminal leucine zipper domain that are highly homologous to similar
domains in AF17 (600328) and BR140 (602410). Northern blot analysis
showed that AF10 is expressed as a 5.5-kb mRNA in many tissues with
highest expression in testis, and has an alternatively spliced exon.

GENE FUNCTION

The AF10 gene is one of the few MLL partner genes to be independently
rearranged with a third gene in leukemia, the CALM gene (603025) in the
t(10;11)(p12;q14) translocation (Dreyling et al., 1996). Chimeric fusion
proteins MLL/AF10 and CALM/AF10 consistently retain the leucine zipper
motif of AF10. Debernardi et al. (2002) used this part of the C-terminal
region as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screening of a testis cDNA library.
They found that the leucine zipper interacted with GAS41 (602116), a
protein previously identified as the product of an amplified gene in a
glioblastoma. GAS41 shows significant homology to the human MLL fusion
partners AF9 (159558) and ENL (159556). The study also showed that GAS41
interacts with integrase interactor-1 (INI1; 601607) and that INI1 is a
component of the SWI/SNF complex (see 604958), which acts to remodel
chromatin and to modulate transcription. Retention of the leucine zipper
in the MLL and CALM fusions suggested that a key feature of these
chimeric proteins may be their ability to interfere in normal gene
regulation through interaction with the adenosine triphosphate-dependent
chromatin remodeling complexes.

MAPPING

Chaplin et al. (1995) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
AF10 gene to 10p12.

CYTOGENETICS

- AF10/MLL Fusion Gene

Chaplin et al. (1995) found that all known translocations involving MLL
and AF10 or AF17 have involved breakpoints between the zinc finger and
leucine zipper domains, and have yielded fusion proteins in which the
MLL zinc fingers were replaced with leucine zipper regions. Chaplin et
al. (1995) speculated that the fusion proteins may participate in
abnormal heterodimers.

- AF10/HEAB Fusion Gene

Tanabe et al. (1996) identified an invins(10;11)(p12;q23q12) and other
complex chromosomal rearrangements in a 2-year old boy with acute
monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5). Cloning of the proximal 10p breakpoint
showed that the MLL gene at chromosome 11q23 was fused to the 3-prime
portion of AF10 at chromosome 10p12. Cloning of the telomeric 10p
junction revealed that the 5-prime portion of AF10 was fused with the
HEAB gene (608757). The 5-prime AF10/HEAB fusion transcript was out of
frame, while the MLL/3-prime AF10 transcript was in frame.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

MLLT10 gene and susceptibility to meningioma, see 607174.
