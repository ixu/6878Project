;;RNA, U83A SMALL NUCLEOLAR; RNU83A;;
snoRNA, U83A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Intronic regions of ribosomal protein genes can harbor noncoding small
nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), like SNORD83A, which are generated during
pre-mRNA processing. snoRNAs form part of the small nucleolar
ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs) involved in pre-rRNA processing
and modification. snoRNAs of the box C/D class, like SNORD83A, function
in 2-prime-O-ribose methylation of rRNAs (Duga et al., 2000).

CLONING

Duga et al. (2000) identified several snoRNAs, including SNORD83A, which
they called U83A, within introns of the bovine and human RPL3 (604163)
genes. U83A originates from intron 5 of RPL3. The 95-nucleotide U83A has
a region complementary to 18S RNA and contains canonical motifs of box
C/D snoRNAs. Sequence analysis suggested that U83A forms a stem-loop
structure through basepairing of the 5-prime and 3-prime terminal
sequences. In this model, the loop contains boxes C and D on either side
of the stem, with the sequence complementary to 18S rRNA located
immediately upstream of box D. Northern blot analysis using a bovine
probe detected U83A expression in HeLa cells, mouse fibroblasts, and
bovine brain. RT-PCR detected U83A expression in a bovine kidney cell
line.

MAPPING

Duga et al. (2000) identified SNORD83A within intron 5 of the RPL3 gene
on chromosome 22q.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing a region of chromosome 18 that contains a segment deleted
in the Ma29 lung cancer cell line, followed by screening a brain cDNA
library, Yanaihara et al. (2001) cloned B29. B29 is located outside the
Ma29 deletion. The deduced B29 protein contains 248 amino acids.
Yanaihara et al. (2001) also identified 3 minor isoforms that differ in
the reading frame utilized and in the presence or absence of exon 3
and/or exon 6. Expression levels were below the limit of detection for
Northern blot analysis, but RT-PCR found near ubiquitous expression.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yanaihara et al. (2001) determined that the B29 gene contains 8 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yanaihara et al. (2001) mapped the B29
gene to chromosome 18q21.

PIK3R2/UPS8 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase that
phosphorylates the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol and related
compounds at the 3-prime position. The products of these reactions serve
as second messengers in growth signaling pathways. The kinase itself is
made up of a catalytic subunit of molecular mass 110 kD (PIK3CA; 171834)
and a regulatory subunit of either 85 kD, 55 kD, or 50 kD. Otsu et al.
(1991) showed that the bovine PI3K p85 subunit consists of 2 closely
related proteins, p85-alpha (171833) and p85-beta. They cloned cDNAs
encoding both p85 subunits, each of which is 724 amino acids long. The
subunits share 62% amino acid identity across their entire length. Both
sequences contain an N-terminal SH3 region, 2 SH2 regions, and a region
of homology to BCR (151410).

Janssen et al. (1998) determined the human p85-beta cDNA sequence.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional expression studies by Otsu et al. (1991) showed that both
bovine p85 subunits bound tyrosine kinase receptors.

Hale et al. (2006) generated a laryngeal carcinoma cell line
constitutively expressing influenza A virus NS1 protein and found that
NS1 bound specifically to p85-beta. The NS1 protein from various
influenza strains also bound p85-beta, but not p85-alpha. Expression of
NS1 led to induction of PI3K signaling, including phosphorylation of AKT
(164730) at ser473. Binding of p85-beta and activation of PI3K required
tyr89 of NS1, and mutant viruses expressing NS1 with a tyr89-to-phe
substitution grew more slowly in cell culture than wildtype viruses.
Hale et al. (2006) proposed that activation of PI3K signaling in
influenza A virus-infected cells is important for efficient virus
replication.

Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Park et al. (2010) showed that, in
addition to regulating PI3K function, p85-alpha and p85-beta regulated
the function of Xbp1s (XBP1; 194355), a transcription factor that
orchestrates the unfolded protein response (UPR) following endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress. Both p85-alpha and p85-beta bound Xbp1s and
increased its nuclear translocation, and it appeared that the p110 PI3K
catalytic subunit and Xbp1s competed for binding of these regulatory
subunits. p85-alpha and p85-beta formed an inactive dimer that was
disrupted by insulin in a time-dependent manner, which promoted their
association with Xbp1s. Refeeding of wildtype mice after fasting induced
ER stress that was quickly resolved, as measured by Xbp1s levels. In
contrast, obese and insulin-resistant ob/ob (LEP; 164160) mice could not
resolve the ER stress induced during refeeding, and nuclear
translocation of Xbp1s was absent in ob/ob mice. Overexpression of
p85-alpha or p85-beta in livers of ob/ob mice increased glucose
tolerance and reduced blood glucose concentrations.

To assess the impact of the AKT3 (611223), PIK3R2, and PIK3CA mutations
in individuals with megalencephaly-capillary malformation-polymicrogyria
syndrome (MCAP; 602501) and megalencephaly polymicrogyria-polydactyly
hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH; 603387) on PI3K activity, Riviere et al.
(2012) used immunostaining to compare PIP3 amounts in lymphoblastoid
cell lines derived from 4 mutation carriers with megalencephaly to those
in control and PTEN (601728)-mutant cells. Consistent with elevated PI3K
activity, and similar to what is seen with PTEN loss, all 3 lines with
PIK3R2 or PIK3CA mutations showed significantly more PIP3 staining than
control cells, as well as greater localization of active
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDPK1; 605213) to the cell
membrane. Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor PI-103 resulted in less PIP3
in the PIK3R2 G373R (603157.0001) and PIK3CA E453del (171834.0014)
mutant lines, confirming that these results are PI3K-dependent. Riviere
et al. (2012) found no evidence for increased PI3K activity in the
AKT3-mutant line, consistent with a mutation affecting a downstream
effector of PI3K. Protein blot analysis showed higher amounts of
phosphorylated S6 protein and 4E-BP1 in all mutant cell lines compared
to controls. Although PI-103 treatment reduced S6 phosphorylation in
control and mutant lines, the latter showed relative resistance to PI3K
inhibition, consistent with elevated signaling through the pathway.
Riviere et al. (2012) concluded that the megalencephaly-associated
mutations result in higher PI3K activity and PI3K-mTOR signaling.

MAPPING

Volinia et al. (1992) used in situ hybridization to map the PIK3R2 gene
to human chromosome 19q13.2-q13.4.

CYTOGENETICS

Janssen et al. (1998) analyzed DNA from a patient with chronic
myeloproliferative disorder. They identified an oncogenic fusion of the
5-prime end of p85-beta and the 3-prime end of HUMORF8 (USP8; 603158).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Riviere et al. (2012) performed exome sequencing in the oldest of 3
affected sibs with MPPH and identified a heterozygous mutation in the
PIK3R2 gene (G373R; 603157.0001). Sanger sequencing confirmed the
presence of the mutation in all 3 affected sibs and its absence in the
saliva and blood of both parents and the unaffected sister, showing
germline mosaicism in 1 parent. Sequencing of the PIK3R2 gene in 40
individuals with megalencephaly identified the same nucleotide change in
10 additional subjects with MPPH, and this mutation was shown to be de
novo in all subjects for whom parental DNA was available. The mutation
occurred at a CpG dinucleotide, which might explain its recurrence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Oak et al. (2006) crossed mice with a floxed Pik3r1 allele and a null
Pik3r2 allele with Lck (153390)-Cre transgenic mice to generate a strain
in which class IA Pi3k expression and function were essentially
abrogated in T cells beginning at the double-negative stage.
Histopathologic analysis of these mice showed development of
organ-specific autoimmunity resembling Sjogren syndrome (SS; 270150). By
3 to 8 months of age, mutant mice developed corneal opacity and eye
lesions due to irritation and constant scratching. Mutant mice showed
marked lymphocytic infiltration of lacrimal glands and serum antinuclear
and anti-Ssa (SSA1; 109092) antibodies, but no kidney pathology.
Cd4-positive T cells, which were the predominant infiltrating cells in
lacrimal glands of mutant mice, exhibited aberrant differentiation in
vitro. Oak et al. (2006) concluded that impaired class IA PI3K signaling
in T cells can lead to organ-specific autoimmunity, and they proposed
that class IA Pi3k-deficient mice manifest the cardinal features of
human primary SS.

In 13 individuals with
megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH;
603387) from 11 unrelated families, Riviere et al. (2012) identified a
heterozygous 1117G-A transition in the PIK3R2 gene, resulting in a
gly373-to-arg (G373R) substitution in the PIK3R2 gene. This mutation was
shown to be de novo in all subjects for whom parental DNA was available.
The mutation occurred at a CpG dinucleotide, which might explain its
recurrence.

614355	TITLE *614355 ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE SHORT CHAIN FAMILY, MEMBER 1; ACSS1
;;ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE 1; ACECS1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Fatty acids are incorporated into membranes and signaling molecules and
have roles in energy storage and metabolism. These essential functions
require activation of the fatty acid by acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
synthetases, such as ACSS1, which form an activating thioester linkage
between the fatty acid and CoA (Watkins et al., 2007).

CLONING

Fujino et al. (2001) cloned mouse Acss1 and Acss2 (605832), which they
called Acecs1 and Acecs2, respectively. The deduced 701-amino acid Acss1
protein shares 45.8% identity with Acss2. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression of a 3.6-kb Acss1 transcript in liver, kidney,
and testis. Lower expression was detected in heart, brain, spleen, lung,
and skeletal muscle. Fractionation of mouse kidney revealed cytosolic
localization for Acss1 and mitochondrial localization for Acss2.

By database analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) identified human ACSS1. The
deduced 689-amino acid protein contains 4 of 5 motifs characteristic of
acyl-CoA synthetases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ACSS1 belongs
to a short chain clade of acyl-CoA synthetases.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying proteins purified from transfected COS-7 cells, Fujino et
al. (2001) showed that both mouse Acss1 and Acss2 preferred acetate as
substrate for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA. Little to no activity was
detected with other short or medium chain fatty acids. Acss1 expression,
but not Acss2 expression, was induced by differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1
cells. In contrast, Acss2 expression, but not Acss1 expression, was
induced by fasting in mice and by diabetes in Zucker rats.

GENE STRUCTURE

Watkins et al. (2007) determined that the ACSS1 gene contains 14 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Watkins et al. (2007) mapped the ACSS1
gene to the minus strand of chromosome 20p11.23-p11.21.

CLONING

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene encodes a
deduced 433-amino acid protein.

MAPPING

Chen and Giblett (1976) and Pearce et al. (1976) presented evidence for
3 enolase loci. By in situ hybridization studies using a probe for ENO2
(131360), Craig et al. (1989) found small aggregates of grains at
1pter-p36, the site of ENO1 (172430), and some at 17pter-p12.

Feo et al. (1990) mapped the muscle-specific beta-enolase (ENO3) to
chromosome 17pter-p11 by analysis of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids
and transfectant cell lines carrying different portions of chromosome
17. This muscle-specific enzyme maps to the region encoding the gene
cluster for the sarcomeric myosin heavy chains (MYH1; 160730).

GENE STRUCTURE

Peshavaria and Day (1991) determined that the ENO3 gene contains 12
exons and spans approximately 6 kb.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a man with glycogen storage disease XIII (GSD13; 612932), Comi et al.
(2001) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ENO3
gene (G156D, 131370.0001; G374E, 131370.0002). Immunohistochemistry and

613583	TITLE *613583 WD REPEAT-CONTAINING PROTEIN 62; WDR62
;;C19ORF14
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The WDR62 gene encodes a protein that localizes to the centrosome and to
the nucleus, depending on the cell phase and on the cell type (summary
by Bhat et al., 2011).

CLONING

Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified the WDR62 gene in mutation analysis of
a patient with microcephaly and cortical abnormalities. The WDR62 gene
encodes a 1,523-amino acid protein. Immunohistochemical staining of
human fetal brain at 20 weeks' gestation demonstrated enriched WDR62
expression within the ventricular and subventricular zones. Stainings
suggested predominantly nuclear localization, which was confirmed by
immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis. WDR62 is
expressed by neural stem cells and intermediate progenitors, marked by
SOX2 (184429) and TBR2 (604615) expression. Expression of WDR62 in the
neocortex is transient, spanning the period of embryonic neurogenesis.
Unlike other microcephaly genes, WDR62 apparently does not associate
with centrosomes.

Nicholas et al. (2010) noted that WDR62 contains at least 15 WD repeats.
In HeLa, HEK293, and B lymphoblastoid cells, they found that WDR62 had
weak, diffuse cytoplasmic expression and was not found in the nucleus
during interphase. However, during mitosis, WDR62 accumulated strongly
at the spindle poles, although it was not present at the midbody in
cytokinesis. The expression pattern of WDR62 was identical to that of
ASPM (605481), which is mutant in primary microcephaly-5 (MCPH5;
608716). Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy of mouse embryonic
brain showed Wdr62 expression exclusively in apical precursors
undergoing mitosis at the apical-ventricular surface in the
neuroepithelium of the future cerebral cortex. Wdr62 expression was also
found exclusively in intermediate neural precursors found in the
subventricular zone during mitosis. Similar localization to mitotic
neural precursor cells was observed in human embryonic brain tissue.
WDR62 expression was also found in newborn neurons and in the outermost
layer of neurons that had just migrated to the cortical plate.

Yu et al. (2010) found widespread expression of Wdr62 in the developing
mouse brain, with highest expression in the forebrain. Expression was
seen in the ventricular zone and cortical plate, consistent with roles
in progenitor cells and postmitotic neurons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bilguvar et al. (2010) determined that the WDR62 gene contains 32 exons.

There are alternative WDR62 transcripts in humans: exon 27 contains an
in-frame intraexonic alternative splice acceptor site, resulting in the
exclusion of the first 12 nucleotides (Nicholas et al., 2010).

MAPPING

The WDR62 gene maps to chromosome 19q13.12 (Bilguvar et al., 2010).

GENE FUNCTION

Yu et al. (2010) found notable cell-cycle dependent cellular
localization of WDR62 in HeLa and HEK cells. During interphase, there
was punctate, perinuclear expression, suggesting localization to the
Golgi apparatus, whereas during M phase, WDR62 was found at the spindle
poles. The subcellular localization resembled that of CEP170 (613023).
The findings suggested a major centrosomal role for WDR62.

In cellular studies, Bhat et al. (2011) found that WDR62 localized to
centrosomes throughout mitotic progression. No staining was observed at
the midbody during cytokinesis. During interphase, WDR62 localized to
nucleoli. The findings indicated that WDR62 is a centrosomal as well as
a nuclear protein and that localization is dependent both on the cell
phase and on the cell type.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified 2 missense, 2 nonsense, and 2
frameshift mutations (613583.0001-613583.0005) in the WDR62 gene in 10
patients with microcephaly-2 with cortical malformations (MCPH2;
604317). All patients were from consanguineous Turkish families and
manifested with microcephaly, moderate to severe mental retardation, and
cortical malformation including pachygyria with cortical thickening,
microgyria, lissencephaly, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum,
schizencephaly, and in 1 instance, cerebellar hypoplasia.

In affected members of 2 consanguineous Pakistani families with primary
microcephaly showing linkage to chromosome 19q13 (MCPH2) (Roberts et
al., 1999), Nicholas et al. (2010) identified 2 different homozygous
mutations in the WDR62 gene (613583.0006 and 613583.0007, respectively).
In 5 additional consanguineous families of Pakistani, Arab, and
Caucasian ancestry with primary microcephaly, they identified 4
different homozygous WDR62 mutations (see, e.g.,
613583.0008-613583.0009, 613583.0011). Overall, the findings indicated
that WDR62 is a key protein in enabling spindle poles to position the
cytokinetic furrow and prolong neural precursor generation, a process
that is uniquely vital to the proper growth of the human cerebral
cortex.

Yu et al. (2010) identified 6 different homozygous mutations in the
WDR62 gene (see, e.g., 613583.0009-613583.0011) in affected members of 6
consanguineous families with microcephaly-2 with cortical malformations,
including polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, and subcortical heterotopia.

Bhat et al. (2011) identified 2 different homozygous truncating WDR62
mutations in 2 unrelated consanguineous Indian families with MCPH2 with
cortical malformations, bringing the total number of pathogenic
mutations in the gene to 17. Six of the 17 mutations are missense, and
mutations occur throughout the gene sequence. Bhat et al. (2011)
emphasized the wide phenotypic spectrum of cortical malformations in
mutation carriers.

MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 4-BP DEL, TGCC

In 2 sibs with autosomal recessive microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317) and in an affected child from another family, all
from consanguineous Turkish unions, Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for a 4-basepair deletion (TGCC) in exon 31 of the WDR62
gene. This deletion occurred at amino acid 1,402 and resulted in
frameshift and premature termination (V1402GfsX12). The mutation was
heterozygous in all parents. It was not observed in 1,290 Turkish
control chromosomes. The index patient was a 4-year, 6-month-old female
who initially presented at 4 months of age with small head size. At 2
years, 3 months she showed micrognathia and a bulbous nose, and suffered
from severe mental retardation. She had had no seizures. MRI showed
diffuse cortical thickening and pachygyria. The patient from the second
family was a 2-year, 4 month-old male. He had microcephaly and
developmental delay but no seizures. Coronal images of this patient
showed findings of microlissencephaly including prominent microcephaly,
bilateral Sylvian clefts, hypoplastic corpus callosum, and thickened
cortex. The kinship coefficients between affected individuals from both
families were consistent with fourth-degree relatedness.

.0002
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, GLU526LYS

In a 15-year, 5-month old female with microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317), the child of consanguineous Turkish parents,
Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a G-to-A substitution
in exon 12 of the WDR62 gene, resulting in a glutamic acid-to-lysine
substitution at codon 526 (E526K). The glutamic acid at codon 526 was
invariant in all species examined from human to zebrafish and lamprey.
This mutation was found in heterozygosity in 3 apparently unrelated
neurologically normal Turkish individuals, giving an allele frequency of
0.2%. The patient presented to medical attention at age 3.5 years with
poor verbal skills. She had microcephaly, severe mental retardation,
prognathism, dysconjugate gaze, and dysarthria, and was able to ambulate
independently. Although abnormal electroencephalograms were noted, the
patient never suffered an overt seizure.

.0003
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, TRP224SER

In 2 sibs and their cousin with microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317), Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity
for a missense mutation in the WDR62 gene, a G-to-C transversion in exon
6 that converted tryptophan to serine at codon 224 (W224S). All parents
were heterozygous. The mutation was not identified in 1,290 Turkish and
1,500 Caucasian control chromosomes. Tryptophan-224 was invariant in all
species examined from human to zebrafish and lamprey. The proband was a
6-year, 5-month-old boy who presented at 2 years of age with
hyperactivity, seizures, and inability to sleep. He experienced 4 to 8
seizures per day and had microcephaly, micrognathia, and severe mental
retardation, and could ambulate only with assistance. The sibs were
cousins of the proband. One was an 8-year, 7-month-old female who
presented at age 3 with seizures. She was microcephalic, hyperactive,
and had dysconjugate gaze. She was able to walk independently and had no
obvious dysmorphic features but had moderate mental retardation. Her
brother was 12 years, 11 months old. He had seizures, self-mutilating
behavior, and severe mental retardation, but could ambulate
independently.

.0004
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, GLN470TER

In a 14-year, 6-month-old male with microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317), the product of a consanguineous Turkish union,
Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition
in exon 11 of the WDR62 gene, resulting in a glutamine-to-termination
substitution at codon 470 (Q470X). This mutation was not identified in
1,290 Turkish and 1,500 Caucasian control chromosomes. The patient was
severely mentally retarded but had never had seizures. He had required
surgery for hernia repair and cryptorchidism.

.0005
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 17-BP DEL

In a 10-year, 10-month-old female with microcephaly-2 and cortical
malformations (604317), the product of a consanguineous Turkish union,
Bilguvar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a 17-bp deletion in
exon 30 of the WDR62 gene, leading to a frameshift at codon 1,280 with
premature termination following a novel peptide of 20 amino acids
(G1280AfsX21). She presented to medical attention at 3 months of age
with failure to thrive and small head size. On neurologic examination
she was noted to have good head control. She recognized her mother and
had a social smile. This mutation was not identified in 1,290 Turkish
and 1,500 Caucasian control chromosomes.

WDR62, ARG438HIS

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with primary
microcephaly-2 (MCPH2; 604317), originally reported by Roberts et al.
(1999), Nicholas et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1313G-A
transition in exon 10 of the WDR62 gene, resulting in an arg438-to-his
(R438H) substitution in a highly conserved residue. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that the mutant protein did not localize
correctly to the spindle poles during mitosis. The mutation was not
found in 298 Pakistani control chromosomes. Brain scan from 1 patient
showed a simplified gyral pattern.

.0007
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
WDR62, 1-BP DUP, 4241T

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with MCPH2
(604317), originally reported by Roberts et al. (1999), Nicholas et al.
(2010) identified a homozygous 1-bp duplication (4241dupT) in exon 31 of
the WDR62 gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The
mutation was predicted to result in a stable transcript with C-terminal
deletion of 109 amino acids in a region that contains neither predicted
protein domains nor posttranslational modification sites. The mutation
was not found in 298 Pakistani control chromosomes. In vitro functional
expression assays showed that the mutant protein did not localize
correctly to the spindle poles during mitosis. Brain scans of patients
were not available.

MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
WDR62, ASP511ASN

In affected individuals from 2 unrelated Pakistani families with MCPH2
(604317), Nicholas et al. (2010) identified a homozygous 1531G-A
transition in exon 11 of the WDR62 gene, resulting in an asp511-to-asn
(D511N) substitution in a highly conserved residue. The mutation was
found in 1 of 284 Pakistani control chromosomes. Brain scans of the
affected individuals were not available.

.0009
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 1-BP INS, 3936C

In a Turkish boy, born of consanguineous parents, with microcephaly-2
with cortical malformations (604317), Yu et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1-bp insertion (3936insC) in exon 30 of the WDR62 gene,
resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The mutation was
not identified in 508 control individuals. He had severely delayed
psychomotor development, and brain MRI showed polymicrogyria, simplified
gyral pattern, volume loss, and a corpus callosum with incomplete genu
and small splenium. A second pregnancy was terminated after the
ultrasound showed microcephaly and abnormal gyral pattern in the fetus.

In a Caucasian girl, born of consanguineous parents, with microcephaly,
thickened cerebral cortex, and severe developmental delay, Nicholas et
al. (2010) identified homozygosity for the 3936insC mutation, which they
termed 3936dupC. The mutation was not identified in 396 Caucasian
control chromosomes.

.0010
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 1-BP DEL, 363T

In 3 affected Mexican sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with
microcephaly-2 with cortical malformations (604317), Yu et al. (2010)
identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion (363delT) in exon 4 of the WDR62
gene, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. The mutation
was not identified in 508 control individuals. There was some phenotypic
variability: 2 sibs had small heads with a simplified gyral pattern on
brain MRI, 1 of whom had also had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and
severe psychomotor retardation. The third sib did not have seizures but
had more severe microcephaly (-5.4 SD), normal early psychomotor
development with later delay, and more complex MRI changes, including a
simplified gyral pattern, thin corpus callosum, and subcortical band
heterotopia.

.0011
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH OR WITHOUT CORTICAL
MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, VAL65MET

In 3 affected Saudi Arabian sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with
microcephaly-2 with cortical malformations (604317), Yu et al. (2010)
identified homozygosity for a 193G-A transition in exon 2 of the WDR62
gene, resulting in a val65-to-met (V65M) substitution in a highly
conserved residue. The mutation was not identified in 508 control
individuals. Two sibs were more severely affected, with severe
microcephaly (-9.2 to -9.8 SD), profound psychomotor delay with spastic
quadriparesis, and polymicrogyria and open lip schizencephaly on brain
MRI. The third patient had microcephaly (-5.3 SD), developmental delay,
and simplified gyral pattern on brain MRI. All had relative preservation
of the cerebellum and brainstem.

In 3 Arab sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with primary
microcephaly (MCPH2; 604317), Nicholas et al. (2010) identified
homozygosity for the V65M mutation. The mutation was not identified in
184 Arab control chromosomes. Brain scans of these patients were not
available.

.0012
MICROCEPHALY 2, PRIMARY, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, WITH CORTICAL MALFORMATIONS
WDR62, 1-BP DEL, 2083A

In 2 brothers with MCPH2 with polymicrogyria (604317), who were born of
unrelated parents of northern European descent, Murdock et al. (2011)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 truncating mutations in the
WDR62 gene: a 1-bp deletion (2083delA) in exon 17 and a 2-bp deletion
(2472delAG; 613583.0013) in exon 23. Both mutations were predicted to
cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and loss of function. Each unaffected
parent was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. The mutations were
identified by exome sequencing. The phenotype of the sibs varied. The
first sib, whose pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes, had
a more severe phenotype, with extensive bilateral polymicrogyria,
abnormal corpus callosum, global developmental delay, intractable
seizures, and spastic quadriparesis. The second sib had extensive
polymicrogyria and gray matter heterotopia, but did not have seizures;
he had age-appropriate cognition and only mild unilateral hemiparesis.
Both patients had head circumferences less than the fifth percentile.

607430	TITLE *607430 DAZ-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; DAZAP1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human testis cDNA library with the
coding region of DAZ (400003) as bait, Tsui et al. (2000) cloned cDNAs
encoding DAZAP1 and DAZAP2 (607431). DAZAP1 is an RNA-binding protein of
407 amino acids. It contains 2 RNP motifs in the N terminus and has a
proline-rich C terminus. The protein shares high sequence homology in
the RNP regions with hnRNP A/B proteins (see 600124), but differs from
these proteins in the C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected
expression of 2 DAZAP1 transcripts of 2.75 and 2.4 kb that were most
abundant in the testis and to a lesser degree in the thymus. All other
tissues expressed low levels of the transcript. RT-PCR of RNA samples
from testicular biopsies of 4 infertile men detected expression of
DAZAP1 only in samples with normal spermatogenesis, suggesting that
DAZAP1 is expressed mainly in the germ cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using GST-fusion binding analysis, Tsui et al. (2000) determined that
both DAZAP1 and DAZAP2 interact with DAZ and DAZL (601486). Deletion
constructs indicated that DAZ and DAZL bind to DAZAP1/DAZAP2 mainly
through the DAZ repeat region.

MAPPING

By FISH, Tsui et al. (2000) mapped the DAZAP1 gene to chromosome
19p13.3.

603616	TITLE *603616 RAB GTPase-BINDING EFFECTOR PROTEIN 1; RABEP1
;;RABAPTIN 5; RABPT5
RABEP1/PDGFRB FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The small GTPase RAB5 (179512) is a rate-limiting component in membrane
docking or fusion in the early endocytic pathway. The GTP-bound form of
RAB5 is the active conformation. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Stenmark
et al. (1995) identified HeLa cell cDNAs encoding a protein that
interacted with the GTP-bound form of RAB5. The predicted 862-amino acid
protein was designated rabaptin-5, a name combining the Greek word
'apto,' meaning 'touch', with RAB5. Both the N- and C-terminal regions
of rabaptin-5 are predicted to be mainly alpha-helical and contain
heptad repeats characteristic of coiled-coil domains. Western blot
analysis of mammalian cell extracts indicated that the 115-kD protein is
ubiquitously expressed and is present in a major cytosolic and minor
endosome-bound pool.

GENE FUNCTION

Stenmark et al. (1995) demonstrated that rabaptin-5 binds directly to
RAB5 and preferentially to its GTP-bound form. RAB5 recruits rabaptin-5
to early endosomes in a GTP-dependent manner. Overexpression of
rabaptin-5 leads to morphologic alterations of the early endosome
compartment similar to those induced by overexpression of RAB5. The
authors concluded that rabaptin-5 is an effector of RAB5 that transmits
the signal of the active GTP-bound RAB5 conformation to the membrane
docking and/or fusion apparatus. They proposed a model in which RAB5-GDP
is converted by a membrane-bound GDP/GTP exchange factor into the active
GTP-bound conformation. Once activated, GTP-bound RAB5 then recruits
rabaptin-5 from the cytosol, thereby positioning rabaptin-5 to exert its
function in membrane docking or fusion.

Xiao et al. (1997) reported that tuberin (191092) exhibits substantial
GTPase-activating protein activity towards RAB5, and that rabaptin-5
mediates the tuberin association with RAB5.

Using immunodepletion experiments, Horiuchi et al. (1997) found that the
RABGEF1 (609700)-RABPT5 complex was essential for both homotypic and
heterotypic endosome fusions. Both RABGEF1 and RABPT5 bound RAB5
preferentially in the presence of GTP rather than GDP. RABGEF1 displayed
specific GDP/GTP exchange activity on RAB5 upon delivery of RAB5 to the
membrane.

Mattera et al. (2003) found that the GGAs (e.g., GGA1; 606004), a family
of ARF (see 103180)-dependent clathrin adaptors involved in selection of
trans-Golgi network cargo, interacted with the RABGEF1-RABPT5 complex in
vitro and in vivo.

Omori et al. (2008) identified elipsa, the zebrafish ortholog of
TRAF3IP1 (607380), as a component of intraflagellar transport particles,
which are involved in the formation and function of cilia. Elipsa
interacted with rabaptin-5, which in turn interacted with Rab8 (RAB8A;
165040), a small GTPase localized to cilia. Omori et al. (2008)
concluded that elipsa, rabaptin-5, and Rab8 provide a bridge between the
intraflagellar transport particle and protein complexes that assemble at
the ciliary membrane.

Endocytosis plays a major role in the deactivation of receptors
localized to the plasma membrane. Wang et al. (2009) found that hypoxia,
via the VHL (608537)-HIF2A (EPAS1; 603349) signaling pathway,
downregulated rabaptin-5 expression, leading to decelerated endocytosis
and prolonged activation of ligand-bound EGFR (131550). Primary kidney
and breast tumors with strong hypoxic signatures showed significantly
lower expression of rabaptin-5 RNA and protein. Wang et al. (2009)
identified a conserved hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) in the
rabaptin-5 promoter that bound in vitro-translated HIF1A (603348) and
HIF2A, leading to displacement of RNA polymerase II and attenuating
rabaptin-5 transcription.

MAPPING

The RABEP1 gene maps to chromosome 17p13 (Magnusson et al., 2001).

CYTOGENETICS

In a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; see 607785) and
an acquired t(5;17)(q33;p13), Magnusson et al. (2001) demonstrated
rabaptin-5 as a novel partner fused in-frame to the 5-prime portion of
the PDGFBR gene (173410). The fusion protein included more than 85% of
the native rabaptin-5 fused to the transmembrane and intracellular
tyrosine kinase domains of PDGFRB. Rabaptin-5 is an essential and
rate-limiting component of early endosomal fusion. The RABEP1/PDGFRB
fusion protein links 2 important pathways of growth regulation.

;;GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATASE, CATALYTIC, 1; G6PC1;;
G6PT, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9), the key enzyme in the homeostasis
regulation of blood glucose concentrations, catalyzes the terminal step
in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (summary by Lei et al., 1993).

CLONING

Lei et al. (1993) cloned human G6PC from a liver cDNA library. G6PC
encodes a predicted 357-amino acid protein with an endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) retention signal and 6 putative membrane-spanning segments. The
expressed protein is indistinguishable from human microsomal G6Pase. Lei
et al. (1993) stated that the gene had previously eluded molecular
characterization primarily because of its tight association with the ER
and nuclear membranes.

Shelly et al. (1993) isolated cDNAs encoding G6Pase by taking advantage
of an albino deletion mutant mouse that is known to express markedly
reduced levels of G6Pase activity. The primary defect of this mutant
mouse is a loss of the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase gene (FAH; 613871)
located near the albino locus on chromosome 7. Fumarylacetoacetate
hydrolase (or fumarylacetoacetase) is the final enzyme in the tyrosine
degradation pathway, and a deficiency of this enzyme leads to the
accumulation of toxic tyrosine metabolites, resulting in reduced
expression of a group of liver-specific proteins, including G6Pase.
Newborn homozygous deletion mice develop hypoglycemia shortly after
birth, correlating with undetectable levels of G6Pase activity. Shelly
et al. (1993) isolated a full-length cDNA encoding murine liver
microsomal G6Pase by screening a normal mouse liver cDNA library
differentially with probes representing mRNA populations from the normal
and the albino deletion mutant mouse. They showed that the murine G6Pase
transcription unit spans approximately 10 kb and consists of 5 exons.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lei et al. (1993) determined that the G6PC gene contains 5 exons and
spans approximately 12.5 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Lei et al. (1994) mapped the G6PC
gene to chromosome 17.

In the course of constructing a transcription map of approximately 600
kb of genomic DNA surrounding the BRCA1 gene (113705), Brody et al.
(1995) identified the G6PC gene, thus regionalizing its assignment to
17q21.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients with glycogen storage disease Ia (GSD1a; 232200), Lei et
al. (1993) identified homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations,
respectively, in the G6PC gene (613742.0001-613742.0003).

Lei et al. (1995) used SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing to characterize
the G6PC gene of 70 unrelated patients with enzymatically confirmed
diagnosis of type Ia GSD and detected mutations in all except 17 alleles
(88%). They uncovered 16 mutations that were shown by expression to
abolish or greatly reduce G6Pase activity and that, therefore, were
responsible for the clinical disorder. R83C (613742.0002) and Q347X
(613742.0004) were the most prevalent mutations found in Caucasians;
130X (613742.0001) and R83C were most prevalent in Hispanics; R83H was
most prevalent in Chinese. The Q347X mutation was identified only in
Caucasians, and the 130X mutation was identified only in Hispanic
patients.

Kajihara et al. (1995) identified a splice mutation in exon 5 (727G-T)
of the G6PC cDNA from the liver of a Japanese patient with GSD type Ia
(613742.0005). Another 8 unrelated Japanese families with a total of 9
affected individuals were found to have the same mutation, thus
representing 91% of patients and carriers of GSD Ia in Japan.

Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996) sequenced both alleles of 24 French GSD
type Ia patients; 14 different mutations were found, allowing the
identification of complete genotypes for all the patients. These
included 9 new mutations. Five mutations, Q347X, R83C, D38V
(613742.0006), G188R (613742.0012), and 158Cdel, accounted for 75% of
the mutated alleles.

Parvari et al. (1997) reported the biochemical and clinical
characteristics as well as mutation analyses of 12 Israeli GSD Ia
patients of different families, who represent most of the GSD Ia
patients in Israel. All 9 Jewish patients, as well as a Muslim Arab
patient, were found to have the R83C mutation (613742.0002). Two Muslim
Arab patients had the val166-to-gly (V166G) mutation (613742.0014),
which had not been found in other populations.

Akanuma et al. (2000) identified G6PC mutations in all alleles from 51
unrelated Japanese patients with GSD Ia. A total of 7 mutations were
identified, including 3 novel mutations. The most prevalent mutation,
727G-T, accounting for 88 of 102 mutant alleles, creates an aberrant
3-prime splice site within exon 5. The authors demonstrated that
ectopically transcribed G6Pase mRNA can be detected in lymphoblastoid
cells and may be used for the characterization of mutations that affect
mRNA splicing. They concluded that noninvasive molecular diagnosis may
ultimately replace the conventional method of enzymatic diagnosis that
requires liver biopsy in Japanese patients.

Stroppiano et al. (1999) analyzed the G6Pase gene in 53 unrelated
Italian patients and identified 88 mutant alleles (82.6%) with 18
(17.4%) remaining unidentified. The most prevalent mutation was R83C
(46.2%), followed by Q347X (20.7%); 3 other mutations (R295C, D38V, and
G270V) accounted for 5.6% of disease alleles. The authors suggested that
noninvasive screening could be used in Italian patients clinically
suspected of having GSD Ia, particularly in those from Sicily, where the
R83C mutation was present in 80% of mutant alleles. In all of 13
unrelated Korean patients with GSD Ia, Ki et al. (2004) identified
mutant alleles of the G6PC gene. Three known mutations and 2 novel
mutations were identified. The most frequent mutant allele was 727G-T,
present in 21 of 26 alleles (81%), which was slightly lower than that in
Japanese, where it was present in 86 alleles (92%), but much higher than
that in Taiwan Chinese (present in 44.4% of alleles).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, 2-BP INS, 459AT

In a patient with type Ia glycogen storage disease (232200), Lei et al.
(1993) found a 2-bp insertion at nucleotide 459 (ATins459) in exon 3 of
the G6PC gene. The insertion caused a frameshift with generation of a
stop codon at nucleotides 467-469. The predicted gene product was a
severely truncated protein of 129 amino acids. The patient was
homozygous for the TA insertion and the mother, the only parent
available, was heterozygous. Lei et al. (1995) referred to this mutation
as 130X referring to the number of the stop codon that was generated by
the frameshift. The 130X mutation had been identified only in Hispanic
patients.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, ARG83CYS

Lei et al. (1993) concluded that a patient with type Ia glycogen storage
disease (232200) was a compound heterozygote for 2 different G6PC
mutations: arg83-to-cys (R83C) and arg295-to-cys (R295C; 613742.0003),
located in exons 2 and 5, respectively. The exon 5 mutation came from
the father and the exon 2 mutation from the mother. Both mutations were
thought to involve a CpG doublet. Lei et al. (1994) demonstrated that
the R83C mutant has no detectable phosphohydrolase activity.

In a patient originally reported by Burchell and Waddell (1990) as
having a novel form of type 1 glycogen storage disease due to a defect
in the 21-kD stabilizing protein SP, Lei et al. (1995) demonstrated that
in fact there was an R83C mutation in exon 2 of the G6PC gene. They
found the same mutation in both homozygous and heterozygous form in
patients with standard GSD type Ia.

Qu et al. (1996) performed prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus
sampling in an Ashkenazi Jewish family in which a previous child was
homoallelic and both parents were heterozygous for the R83C mutation.
Molecular analysis showed that the fetus was not affected.

Parvari et al. (1997) found that the R83C mutation was present in all
Ashkenazi Jewish patients studied in Israel, suggesting that DNA-based
diagnosis may be used as an initial diagnostic step in this population,
thus avoiding liver biopsy.

Ekstein et al. (2004) tested 20,719 Ashkenazi Jewish subjects for the
R83C mutation and identified 290 carriers, giving a carrier frequency of
0.014. The authors noted that this carrier frequency translates into a
predicted disease prevalence of 1 in 20,000, 5 times higher than that
for the general Caucasian population, confirming a founder effect and
elevated frequency of type Ia glycogen storage disease in the Ashkenazi
population. They also tested 4,290 Ashkenazi subjects for the Q347X
(613742.0004) mutation and found no carriers. Of 30 Ashkenazi Jewish
patients with type Ia glycogen storage disease, all were homozygous for
the R83C mutation. Ekstein et al. (2004) concluded that R83C is the only
prevalent mutation for this disease in the Ashkenazi population.

See 613742.0002 and Lei et al. (1993).

.0004
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, GLN347TER

In a patient with type Ia glycogen storage disease (232200), Lei et al.
(1994) demonstrated compound heterozygosity for an arg83-to-cys mutation
(613742.0002) in exon 2 and a gln347-to-ter mutation in exon 5. The
latter mutation was detected in homozygous form in 2 sibs of an
unrelated family. The predicted Q347X mutant G6Pase is a truncated
protein of 346 amino acids, 11 amino acids shorter than the wildtype
G6Pase. Site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assays
demonstrated that the mutant protein is devoid of G6Pase activity.

.0005
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, IVS4AS, G-T, +86

In a 26-year-old man with GSD Ia (232200) and in 9 other Japanese
patients from 8 unrelated families, Kajihara et al. (1995) identified a
splicing mutation in the G6PC gene. The first patient was the progeny of
first-cousin parents and had a history of hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia
since childhood. The diagnosis of GSD Ia was based on the findings of
hypoglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia and liver biopsy
abnormalities. Residual G6Pase activity in the liver was 18% of normal
in both fresh and previously frozen liver biopsy specimens. A younger
brother was also affected. The cDNA prepared from the patient's liver
had a deletion of 91 nucleotides with no normal-sized cDNA. The mutation
resulted in a G6Pase polypeptide 146 amino acids shorter at the
carboxy-terminal portion than the normal gene product of 357 residues.
It was thought that the 18% of normal activity reflected nonspecific
phosphatase activity since the G6Pase activity was low or not detectable
in several unrelated GSD Ia patients homozygous for this mutation.
Analysis of mutant genomic DNA demonstrated a G-to-T transversion at
nucleotide 727 of their G6PC sequence. Although the patient's splice
site in intron 4 and exon 5 had a normal consensus sequence, normal
splicing did not occur. It is thought that the single base substitution,
located far from the splice junction, altered the splice site. Kajihara
et al. (1995) cited data indicating that 11% of aberrant splice
mutations represent the creation of new splice sites with no alteration
in the authentic splice site sequences. Nakai and Sakamoto (1994) found
that new 5-prime and 3-prime sites were created only in the upstream
region of the authentic 5-prime and 3-prime splice sites. However, this
characteristically Japanese GSD Ia mutation is an exception; a new
3-prime site occurred in the downstream region of a normal splice site.

Akanuma et al. (2000) found that the most prevalent mutation in a study
of 51 unrelated Japanese patients with GSD Ia was 727G-T, accounting for
88 of 102 mutant alleles.

.0006
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, ASP38VAL

In 4 unrelated French patients with GSD type Ia (232200),
Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996) found compound heterozygosity for a D38V
missense mutation in the G6PC gene. This resulted from an A-to-T
transversion of nucleotide 192 in exon 1. The mutation was predicted to
change an acidic amino acid (aspartic acid) to a nonpolar hydrophobic
amino acid (valine) in the middle of the first predicted transmembrane
spanning domain.

.0007
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, TRP77ARG

In a French patient with GSD type Ia (232200), Chevalier-Porst et al.
(1996) found compound heterozygosity for a W77R missense mutation in the
G6PC gene. The mutation changed a nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid
(tryptophan) to a basic one (arginine). The amino acid substitution
resulted from a T-to-C transition of nucleotide 308 in exon 1.

.0008
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, IVS1DS, A-G, +4

In a French patient with GSD Ia (232200), Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996)
found an A-to-G transition at position +4 of the 5-prime donor splice
site of intron 1 of the G6PC gene. The patient was a compound
heterozygote for this mutation and for the G188R mutation (613742.0012).

.0009
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, GLU110LYS

In a French patient with GSD Ia (232200), Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996)
found a E110K missense mutation in the G6PC gene. The mutation changed
an acidic amino acid (glutamic acid) to a basic amino acid (lysine). It
was due to a G-to-A transition of nucleotide 407 in exon 2. The mutation
was present in compound heterozygous state.

.0010
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, ALA124THR

In a French patient with GSD type Ia (232200), Chevalier-Porst et al.
(1996) identified a G-to-A transition of nucleotide 449 in exon 3 which
changed a nonpolar amino acid (alanine-124) to a polar one (threonine).
This mutation, inherited from the mother, was associated with the Q347X
mutation (613742.0004) in 2 sibs with GSD Ia.

.0011
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, GLY184GLU

In a French patient with type Ia glycogen storage disease (232200),
Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996) found a G-to-A transition of nucleotide
630 changing a nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid (glycine-184) to an
acidic one (glutamic acid). The G184E mutation is located in the
putative cytoplasmic domain of the enzyme. The mutation was present in
homozygous state in a family with no known consanguinity.

.0012
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, GLY188ARG

In 3 unrelated French patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia
(232200), Chevalier-Porst et al. (1996) found compound heterozygosity
for a G-to-C transversion of nucleotide 641, resulting in change of a
nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid (glycine-188) to a basic one (arginine).
This mutation, like G184E (613742.0011), is located in the putative
cytoplasmic domain of the enzyme.

Weston et al. (2000) identified a 5-month-old girl with hypoglycemia,
hepatomegaly, and lactic acidemia who was diagnosed with GSD Ia. She
also developed neutropenia, neutrophil dysfunction, and recurrent
infections characteristic of GSD Ib, but was found to be homozygous for
the G188R mutation of the G6PC gene. No mutations in the G6PC
translocase gene were identified. Weston et al. (2000) subsequently
identified a sib of this proband and 2 unrelated patients with similar
genotype-phenotype characteristics. They concluded that the unusual
association of neutrophil abnormalities in patients with homozygous
G188R mutations in the G6PC gene supports the modified
translocase/catalytic unit model.

.0013
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, ILE341ASP

In 2 sibs with type Ia GSD (232200), Lee et al. (1996) found compound
heterozygosity for an R83C substitution in exon 2 (613742.0002) and an
ile341-to-asp substitution in exon 5 of the G6PC gene. The nucleotide
substitutions were a G-to-A transition at base position 327 in exon 2
and a T-to-A transversion at base position 1101 in exon 5. The father
was heterozygous for the exon 2 mutation, while the mother was
heterozygous for the exon 5 mutation.

.0014
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE Ia
G6PC, VAL166GLY

In 2 Muslim Arab patients in Israel with glycogen storage disease Ia
(232200), Parvari et al. (1997) identified a val166-to-gly (V166G)
missense mutation in the G6PC gene.

603721	TITLE *603721 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2L 3; UBE2L3
;;UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME UBCH7; UBCH7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s or UBCs) are essential components of
the posttranslational protein ubiquitination pathway, mediating the
transfer of activated ubiquitin to substrate proteins.

CLONING

The S. cerevisiae UBC1, UBC4, and UBC5 enzymes appear to participate in
the degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins. Human UBE2L1
(600012) is a homolog of yeast UBC4 and UBC5. By screening a genomic
library with a UBE2L1 probe, Moynihan et al. (1996) isolated clones
corresponding to a novel gene, UBE2L3.

Nuber et al. (1996) cloned human keratinocyte cDNAs encoding UBE2L3,
which they referred to as UBCH7. The predicted 154-amino acid protein
has 64% sequence similarity to UBCH5. UBCH7 efficiently mediated E6AP
(UBE3A; 601623)-dependent ubiquitination in an in vitro assay.

By RT-PCR, Moynihan et al. (1998) determined that UBE2L3 is expressed as
4 mRNAs that differ in the length of the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR). Sequence comparisons revealed that the human and mouse UBE2L3
cDNAs share 97% DNA sequence identity in the coding region and 93%
identity for 287 nucleotides extending into the 3-prime UTR. The
predicted mouse and human UBE2L3 proteins are identical.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moynihan et al. (1996) demonstrated that the UBE2L3 and UBE2L1 genes are
identical except that the UBE2L1 gene is intronless, while the UBE2L3
coding sequence is interrupted by 3 introns. Moynihan et al. (1998)
determined that the UBE2L3 gene spans approximately 57 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by FISH, Moynihan et al. (1996)
mapped the UBE2L3 gene to chromosome 22q11.2-q13.1. They also mapped a
pseudogene, UBE2L2, to 12q12. Ardley et al. (1997) found that another
pseudogene, UBE2L4, was located at 19q13.1-q13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Shimura et al. (2001) hypothesized that alpha-synuclein (163890) and
parkin (602544) interact functionally, namely, that parkin ubiquitinates
alpha-synuclein normally and that this process is altered in autosomal
recessive Parkinson disease (600116). Shimura et al. (2001) identified a
protein complex in normal human brain that includes parkin as the E3
ubiquitin ligase, UBCH7 as its associated E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme, and a novel 22-kD glycosylated form of alpha-synuclein
(alpha-Sp22) as its substrate. In contrast to normal parkin, mutant
parkin associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson disease failed to
bind alpha-Sp22. In an in vitro ubiquitination assay, alpha-Sp22 was
modified by normal, but not mutant, parkin into polyubiquitinated, high
molecular weight species. Accordingly, alpha-Sp22 accumulated in a
nonubiquitinated form in parkin-deficient Parkinson disease brains.
Shimura et al. (2001) concluded that alpha-Sp22 is a substrate for
parkin's ubiquitin ligase activity in normal human brain and that loss
of parkin function causes pathologic accumulation of alpha-Sp22. These
findings demonstrated a critical biochemical reaction between the 2
Parkinson disease-linked gene products and suggested that this reaction
underlies the accumulation of ubiquitinated alpha-synuclein in
conventional Parkinson disease.

Carrano et al. (2009) identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase Wwp1 (602307)
as a positive regulator of life span in C. elegans in response to
dietary restriction. Overexpression of Wwp1 in worms extended life span
by up to 20% under conditions of ad libitum feeding. Conversely,
reduction of Wwp1 completely suppressed the extended longevity of
diet-restricted animals. The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc18,
which is homologous to human UBE2L3, interacted with Wwp1 and was
required for Wwp1 ubiquitin ligase activity and the extended longevity
of worms overexpressing Wwp1. Carrano et al. (2009) concluded that Wwp1
and Ubc18 function to ubiquitinate substrates that regulate longevity
induced by diet restriction.

Wenzel et al. (2011) showed that, unlike many ubiquitin-conjugating
enzymes (E2s) that transfer ubiquitin with RINGs, UBCH7 lacks intrinsic
ubiquitin ligase (E3)-independent reactivity with lysine, explaining its
preference for HECTs. Despite lacking lysine reactivity, UBCH7 exhibits
activity with the RING-in-between-RING (RBR) family of E3s that includes
parkin (602544) and human homolog of ariadne (HHARI; 605624). Found in
all eukaryotes, RBRs regulate processes such as translation and immune
signaling. RBRs contain a canonical C3HC4-type RING, followed by 2
conserved cys/his-rich zinc-binding domains, in-between-RING (IBR) and
RING2 domains, which together define this E3 family. Wenzel et al.
(2011) showed that RBRs function like RING/HECT hybrids: they bind E2s
via a RING domain, but transfer ubiquitin through an obligate
thioester-linked ubiquitin, requiring a conserved cysteine residue in
RING2. Wenzel et al. (2011) concluded that their results defined the
functional cadre of E3s for UBCH7, an E2 involved in cell proliferation
and immune function, and indicated a novel mechanism for an entire class
of E3s.

610396	TITLE *610396 TRAFFICKING PROTEIN PARTICLE COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A; TRAPPC6A
;;TRAPP COMPLEX, SUBUNIT 6A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRAPPC6A is a subunit of the TRAPPI and TRAPPII complexes (Gwynn et al.,
2006).

CLONING

Gwynn et al. (2006) cloned mouse Trappc6a, and they identified human
TRAPPC6A by database analysis. Mouse and human TRAPPC6A encode deduced
159-amino acid proteins that share 83% identity and have calculated
molecular masses of 17.4 kD. Both proteins contain 2 motifs conserved in
TRAPPC6B (610397) and several yeast TRAPP subunits, including Trs33, the
putative homolog of TRAPPC6A and TRAPPC6B. Northern blot analysis
detected Trappc6a expression in all mouse tissues examined, with highest
expression in kidney, liver, and testis. Expression of mouse Trappc6a
was higher in cultured melanocytes than in kidney.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gwynn et al. (2006) determined that the mouse Trappc6a gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the
TRAPPC6A gene to chromosome 19 (TMAP RH98840). Gwynn et al. (2006)
mapped the mouse Trappc6a gene to chromosome 7.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gwynn et al. (2006) identified a recessive mutation in mice, designated
'mosaic hypopigmentation' (Mhyp), that caused mosaic loss of coat
pigmentation and patchy loss of pigmentation with abnormal melanosomes
in the retinal pigmented epithelial layer of the eye. They determined
that Mhyp resulted from integration of an 8.4-kb retrovirus into intron
1 of the Trappc6a gene.

602644	TITLE *602644 TETRASPANIN 4; TSPAN4
;;TRANSMEMBRANE 4 SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 7; TM4SF7;;
TETRASPAN;;
NOVEL ANTIGEN 2; NAG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TSPAN4 belongs to the large family of tetraspanins, so named because
they contain 4 transmembrane domains. Tetraspanins are frequently
expressed at the cell surface in association with each other and with
other molecules, such as integrins (see ITGB1; 135630), and they
function to regulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and
differentiation (summary by Todd et al., 1998).

CLONING

Tachibana et al. (1997) generated monoclonal antibodies against proteins
that coimmunoprecipitated with CD81 (TAPA1; 186845) from a human breast
cancer cell line. Two antibodies recognized a 28- to 35-kD protein,
which Tachibana et al. (1997) named NAG2 for 'novel antigen-2.' Using
the antibodies to screen a cDNA expression library derived from the
breast cancer cell line, the authors cloned cDNAs encoding NAG2. The
predicted 238-amino acid NAG2 protein contains 4 hydrophobic domains and
shows homology to transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF) proteins. Northern
blot analysis detected a 1.5-kb NAG2 mRNA, and together with flow
cytometry and immunohistochemistry, showed that NAG2 was expressed in
multiple tissues but was absent in brain, lymphoid cells, and platelets.
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that NAG2 colocalized with CD81 on
the cell surface. Tachibana et al. (1997) identified mouse ESTs encoding
the mouse homolog of NAG2. The human and mouse NAG2 proteins have 95%
amino acid identity.

By searching an EST database for sequences containing a tetraspanin
consensus sequence, Todd et al. (1998) identified human TSPAN4. The
deduced 238-amino acid protein contains 4 transmembrane domains and
other features characteristic of tetraspanins, including conservation of
charged residues in or near the transmembrane domains, similar to ion
channels, and of 4 cysteines in the second extracellular domain.
Northern blot analysis detected highest TSPAN4 expression in heart and
placenta. EST database analysis suggested that TSPAN4 is also expressed
in brain, melanocytes, pancreas, and fetal liver/spleen, in addition to
pregnant uterus and adult and fetal heart.

GENE FUNCTION

Tachibana et al. (1997) found that NAG2 coimmunoprecipitated with
integrins and other TM4SF members, indicating that NAG2 is present in
TM4SF-TM4SF and TM4SF-integrin complexes.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the TSPAN4 gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the TSPAN4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF022813) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

611412	TITLE *611412 N-ACETYLNEURAMINATE PYRUVATE LYASE; NPL
;;CHROMOSOME 1 OPEN READING FRAME 13; C1ORF13;;
DIHYDRODIPICOLINATE SYNTHASE;;
C112
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase (EC 4.1.3.3) controls the cellular
concentration of sialic acid by catalyzing the conversion of sialic acid
into acylmannosamines and pyruvate (Wu et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 1 associated with
hereditary prostate cancer (HPC1; 601518), followed by screening cDNA
libraries, Sood et al. (2001) cloned NPL, which they called C112. The
deduced protein contains 320 amino acids. Northern blot analysis
detected weak expression of a 5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined.

By large-scale sequence analysis of clones obtained from a fetal brain
cDNA library, Wu et al. (2005) cloned a splice variant of NPL. The
deduced 301-amino acid splice variant, which they called NPLV2, contains
an N-terminal dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) domain and 5 putative
N-terminal phosphorylation sites. RT-PCR detected highest expression in
liver, kidney, and peripheral blood leukocytes, and lower expression in
placenta, pancreas, spleen, thymus, ovary, and small intestine. By
database analysis, Wu et al. (2005) identified 3 other NPL splice
variants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wu et al. (2005) determined that the NPL gene contains 11 exons and
spans over 40 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Sood et al. (2001) mapped the NPL gene to
chromosome 1q25.
