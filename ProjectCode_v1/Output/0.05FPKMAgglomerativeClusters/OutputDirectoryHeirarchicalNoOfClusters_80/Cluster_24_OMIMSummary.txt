609864	TITLE *609864 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN 55A; TMEM55A
;;PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 4,5-BISPHOSPHATE 4-PHOSPHATASE, TYPE II
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TMEM55A catalyzes the degradation of phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) by removing the 4-phosphate
(Ungewickell et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching a database for genes encoding proteins similar to
Burkholderia pseudomallei virulence factor BopB, a putative phosphatase,
Ungewickell et al. (2005) identified TMEM55A. The deduced 300-amino acid
protein contains a central Cx(5)R phosphatase catalytic motif and 2
transmembrane domains near its C terminus, a characteristic of lysosomal
transmembrane proteins. RNA dot blot analysis detected expression in all
tissues examined. Fluorescence-tagged TMEM55A localized with membrane
markers of late endosomes or lysosomes.

GENE FUNCTION

Ungewickell et al. (2005) assayed the phosphatase activity of TMEM55A
synthesized in insect cells and found that it specifically catalyzed
removal of the 4-phosphate from PtdIns-4,5-P2. It showed no activity
toward other phosphatidylinositol substrates or inositol phosphates
tested.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ungewickell et al. (2005) mapped the
TMEM55A gene to chromosome 8q21.3.
