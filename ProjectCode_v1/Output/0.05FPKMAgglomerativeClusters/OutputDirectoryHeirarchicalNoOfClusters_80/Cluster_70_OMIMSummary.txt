DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching EST databases with genomic sequences obtained from CpG
islands located in the Xq28 region, Faranda et al. (1996) identified a
gene, which they called ITBA2. The gene is relatively short, contains a
105-amino acid open reading frame, and is ubiquitously expressed.

MAPPING

Faranda et al. (1996) showed that the ITBA2 gene maps close to the GDX
gene (312070) on Xq28 in the interval between the red-green color vision
genes (300822; 300821) and G6PD (305900). It is centromeric to GDX and
is transcribed in the same orientation.

NOMENCLATURE

Faranda (1996) indicated that the designation ITBA2 for this gene was
arbitrarily chosen from the acronym of the institute where she works,
Istituto di Tecnologie Biomediche Avanzate, in Milan, Italy.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By positional cloning of the mucolipidosis IV (252650) locus on
chromosome 19p, Bargal et al. (2000) identified a gene, designated
MCOLN1, encoding a 580-amino acid protein termed mucolipin-1. The
mucolipin-1 protein contains 1 transmembrane helix in the N-terminal
region and at least 5 transmembrane domains in the C-terminal region.

Bassi et al. (2000) also identified the MCOLN1 gene, which they termed
'ML4.' The corresponding protein, which the authors named 'mucolipidin,'
localizes on the plasma membrane and, in the carboxy-terminal region,
shows homology to polycystin-2, the product of the polycystic kidney
disease gene (PKD2; 173910), and to the family of transient receptor
potential Ca(2+) channels (see 602343). They suggested that mucolipidin
plays an important role in endocytosis.

Sun et al. (2000) independently cloned the MCOLN1 gene. The 65-kD
protein contains a transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel
domain (amino acids 331-521) and an internal calcium and sodium channel
pore region (amino acids 496-521). The TRP domain spans transmembrane
segments 3-6, with the putative pore-forming loop between the fifth and
sixth segments. There is also a dileucine motif at the C terminus which
may serve as a late endosomal/lysosomal targeting motif. The protein is
predicted to have both the N- and C-termini within the cytoplasm. Sun et
al. (2000) suggested that mucolipin-1 may play a role in calcium ion
transport.

GENE STRUCTURE

Bargal et al. (2000) determined that the MCOLN1 gene contains 14 exons
spanning approximately 14 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Bargal et al. (2000) mapped the MCOLN1
gene to chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Lysosomal exocytosis is a calcium-dependent process in which late
endosomes fuse with lysosomes, which then fuse to the plasma membrane.
The local calcium source is the luminal compartment of the late endosome
or lysosome itself. By in vitro electrophysiologic studies, LaPlante et
al. (2002, 2004) identified mucolipin-1 as a calcium channel that could
be transiently modulated by changes in calcium concentration. The
channel was also permeable to sodium and potassium, and was detected
both on intracellular vesicular membranes, including lysosomes, and on
the plasma membrane. Fibroblasts derived from ML IV patients with
mutations in the MCOLN1 gene showed disturbed calcium signaling, large
acidic organelles, and decreased fusion between endosomes and lysosomes
compared to wildtype cells. LaPlante et al. (2004) concluded that the
MCOLN1 channel contributes to the increase in local concentrations of
calcium during the transition between different stages in membrane
trafficking. Cells with defects in the MCOLN1 channel cannot release
enough calcium, resulting in slow and inefficient endosomal and
lysosomal fusion and an abnormal accumulation of lipid and other
materials as seen in ML IV.

Raychowdhury et al. (2004) assessed mucolipin-1 channel function from
endosomal vesicles of null (MCOLN1 -/-) and mucolipin-1 over-expressing
cells, and liposomes containing the in vitro translated protein.
Evidence from both preparations indicated that the wildtype protein is a
multiple subconductance nonselective cation channel whose function is
inhibited by a reduction of pH. The V446L and F408del ML IV-causing
mutations retained channel function but not the sharp inhibition by
lowering pH. Atomic force imaging of mucolipin-1 channels indicated that
changes in pH modified the aggregation of unitary channels. The mutant
protein did not change in size on reduction of pH. Raychowdhury et al.
(2004) concluded that mucolipin-1 channel activity is regulated by a
pH-dependent mechanism that is deficient in some ML IV-causing mutations
of the gene. They also suggested a role for cation channels in the
acidification and normal endosomal function.

By transfecting human embryonic kidney cells with various combinations
of mouse Trpml3 (MCOLN3; 607400), chicken Trpml2 (MCOLN2; 607399), and
human TRPML1, Venkatachalam et al. (2006) showed that each TRPML could
form homomultimers and heteromultimers with other TRPML proteins. When
expressed individually, TRPML1 and Trpml2 were lysosomal membrane
proteins, whereas Trpml3 was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. In
contrast, when Trpml3 was coexpressed with either TRPML1 or Trpml2, it
relocalized to lysosomes. Mutation of the lysosomal targeting sequence
of TRPML1 or Trpml2 or disruption of clathrin-mediated endocytosis
caused mislocalization of TRPML1 and Trpml2 to the plasma membrane and
also resulted in plasma membrane distribution of Trpml3. Trpml3 did not
influence the intracellular localization of TRPML1 or Trpml2.

By measuring radiolabeled iron uptake, monitoring the levels of
cytosolic and intralysosomal iron, and by directly patch-clamping the
late endosomal and lysosomal membrane, Dong et al. (2008) showed that
TRPML1 functions as a Fe(2+)-permeable channel in late endosomes and
lysosomes. TRPML1 mutations resulting in ML IV (252650) impair the
permeability of TRPML1 to Fe(2+) to varying degrees, which correlate
well with disease severity. A comparison of TRPML1-null ML IV and
control human skin fibroblasts showed a reduction in cytosolic Fe(2+)
levels, an increase in intralysosomal Fe(2+) levels, and an accumulation
of lipofuscin-like molecules in TRPML1-null cells. Dong et al. (2008)
proposed that TRPML1 mediates a mechanism by which Fe(2+) is released
from late endosomes and lysosomes. Dong et al. (2008) concluded that
impaired iron transport may contribute to both hematologic and
degenerative symptoms of ML IV patients.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 21 Ashkenazi Jewish ML IV patients, Bargal et al. (2000) identified 2
mutations in the MCOLN1 gene (605248.0001; 605248.0002) that correlated
with the major and minor haplotypes identified by Slaugenhaupt et al.
(1999). Six patients were compound heterozygous for both mutations and 2
patients were compound heterozygous for 1 of the founder mutations and a
second unidentified mutation. The clinical manifestations of all
patients showed similar severity.

Bargal et al. (2001) identified 4 mutations in the MCOLN1 gene in
severely affected patients with ML IV. An in-frame deletion (F408del)
was identified in a patient with unusually mild psychomotor retardation.
The frequency of ML IV in the general Jewish Ashkenazi population was
estimated in a sample of 2,000 anonymous, unrelated individuals assayed
for the 2 founder mutations. This analysis indicated a heterozygote
frequency of about 1 in 100.

Edelmann et al. (2002) stated that the 2 common MCOLN1 mutations
(IVS3-2A-G, 605248.0001; del Ex1-Ex7, 605248.0002) accounted for more
than 95% of the mutant alleles in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. In
the greater New York metropolitan area, the frequency of the splice site
mutation was 0.54% and of the deletion mutation 0.25%, for a combined
carrier frequency of 0.79%, or 1 in 127 individuals. They suggested that
the addition of both mutations be considered for prenatal carrier
screening in this population.

Bach et al. (2005) found a carrier frequency of 0.0104 for ML IV in a
population of 66,749 Ashkenazi Jewish subjects of the Dor Yeshorim
program, a unique premarital population-screening program designed for
the Orthodox Jewish community. The distribution of the 2 Ashkenazi
Jewish founder mutations, IVS3-2A-G and del Ex1-Ex7, was determined to
be 78.15% and 21.85%, respectively.

ANIMAL MODEL

Unlike other lysosomal storage diseases, ML IV is not associated with a
lack of lysosomal hydrolases; instead, ML IV cells display abnormal
endocytosis of lipids and accumulate large vesicles, indicating that a
defect in endocytosis may underlie the disease. Fares and Greenwald
(2001) reported the identification of a loss-of-function mutation in the
Caenorhabditis elegans mucolipin-1 homolog, cup-5, and showed that this
mutation resulted in an enhanced rate of uptake of fluid-phase markers,
decreased degradation of endocytosed protein, and accumulation of large
vacuoles. Overexpression of cup-5(+) caused the opposite phenotype,
indicating that cup-5 activity controls aspects of endocytosis.

Venugopal et al. (2007) described a murine model for mucolipidosis type
IV that accurately replicated the phenotypes of patients with the
disorder. The Mcoln1 -/- knockout mice presented with numerous dense
inclusion bodies in all cell types in brain and particularly in neurons,
elevated plasma gastrin, vacuolization in gastric parietal cells, and
retinal degeneration. Neurobehavioral assessments, including analysis of
gait and clasping, confirmed the presence of a neurologic defect. Gait
deficits progressed to complete hind-limb paralysis and death at
approximately 8 months of age. The Mcoln1 -/- mice were born in
mendelian ratios, and both male and female Mcoln1 -/- mice were fertile.
A hallmark of human mucolipidosis IV is elevated plasma gastrin
(Schiffmann et al., 1998), which can be increased up to 13 times that of
normal. Serum gastrin in the knockout mice was significantly elevated
compared with that in wildtype mice.

Using a Drosophila model of ML IV, Venkatachalam et al. (2008) found
that vesicular accumulation of macromolecules was due to defective
autophagy, which resulted in oxidative stress and impaired synaptic
transmission. Late apoptotic cells accumulated in Trpml-mutant brains,
and accumulation of apoptotic cells and motor deficits were suppressed
by expression of wildtype Trpml in neurons, glia, or hematopoietic
cells. Venkatachalam et al. (2008) concluded that the neurodegeneration
and motor defects in this model of ML IV resulted primarily from
decreased clearance of apoptotic cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, IVS3AS, A-G, -2

In 12 of 21 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with mucolipidosis IV (252650)
associated with the major Ashkenazi founder haplotype defined by
Slaugenhaupt et al. (1999), Bargal et al. (2000) identified a homozygous
A-to-G transition in the acceptor splice site of the third intron of the
MCOLN1 gene. One heterozygote was found among 60 Ashkenazi normal
controls; this was consistent with the estimated frequency of
heterozygotes (1/50) in this population.

Bassi et al. (2000) identified this acceptor splice site mutation, which
they designated 486-2A-G, as the major founder mutation in Ashkenazi
Jewish patients. The mutation disrupted the GT-AG rule of splicing and
resulted in a transcript lacking 165 bp, because of the skipping of exon
4. This caused a frameshift leading to a premature translation
termination 374 bp downstream. The predicted truncated protein retained
only the first 21 amino acids of the wildtype protein.

.0002
MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, 6,450-BP DEL

In 1 of 21 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with mucolipidosis IV (252650)
associated with the minor founder haplotype defined by Slaugenhaupt et
al. (1999), Bargal et al. (2000) identified a homozygous 6,450-bp
deletion in the MCOLN1 gene. The deletion spanned a region from 928 bp
upstream from the first exon of MCOLN1 to bp 31 of exon 7 (del EX1-EX7).
The clinical manifestations for homozygotes for either this mutation or
IVS3-2A-G (605248.0001), or compound heterozygotes, showed similar
severity. Among 21 Ashkenazi ML IV patients, 12 were homozygous for the
splice mutation, 1 was homozygous for the del EX1-EX7 mutation, and 6
were compound heterozygotes. Two patients were compound heterozygotes
for one of these mutations and an unidentified second allele.

Bassi et al. (2000) demonstrated this deletion, which they measured to
be 6,432 bp, spanning a region from the 5-prime end of the gene to exon
6, as the minor founder mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish patients.

.0003
MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, ARG321TER

In an Arab-Druze mucolipidosis IV (252650) patient, Bargal et al. (2000)
identified a homozygous 1048C-T transition in exon 8 of the MCOLN1 gene,
resulting in an arg321-to-ter (R321X) mutation. The parents were first
cousins and carried the same unique haplotype.

.0004
MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, 3-BP DEL, 1346CTT

In an Ashkenazi Jewish ML IV (252650) patient, Sun et al. (2000)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the MCOLN1 gene: a
3-bp deletion eliminating codon 408 in the TRP cation channel domain,
and the common splice mutation (605248.0001).

.0005
MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, ASP362TYR

In a non-Ashkenazi Jewish ML IV patient (252650), Sun et al. (2000)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the MCOLN1 gene: a
1209G-T transversion resulting in an asp362-to-tyr (D362Y) substitution
in the TRP cation channel domain, and a 429C-T transition resulting in
an arg102-to-ter (R102X; 605248.0006) termination codon. Dobrovolny et
al. (2007) stated that the D362Y substitution occurs in the third
transmembrane region of the protein and leads to retention of the
protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. They also used nucleotide
designation 1084G-T.

In a non-Ashkenazi Jewish girl with ML IV, Dobrovolny et al. (2007)
identified compound heterozygosity for the D362Y substitution and a
splice site mutation (605248.0009) in the MCLON1 gene. The phenotype was
unusual in that the symptoms were restricted to the eyes, including
corneal clouding and decreased visual acuity. She had no neurologic
abnormalities.

See 605248.0005 and Sun et al. (2000).

.0007
MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, ARG403CYS

Goldin et al. (2004) described a 4-year-old girl with mucolipidosis IV
(252650) who was a compound heterozygote for 2 mutations in the MCOLN1
gene, only 1 of which, inherited from the father, was expressed. They
found in her mucolipin-1 cDNA a 1207C-T transition predicting an
arg403-to-cys change (R403C), which changes a basic amino acid to a
neutral one in the 4th transmembrane domain of mucolipin-1. From the
mother the patient had inherited a 93-bp segment from the mitochondrial
NADH dehydrogenase-5 gene (MTND5; 516005) that was inserted in-frame
prior to the last nucleotide of exon 2 of the MCOLN1 gene
(236-237ins93). This alteration abolished proper splicing of MCOLN1. The
splice site at the end of the exon was not used due to an inhibitory
effect of the inserted segment, resulting in 2 aberrant splice products
containing stop codons in the downstream intron. These products were
eliminated via nonsense-mediated decay. The authors stated that this was
the first report of an inherited transfer of mitochondrial DNA causing a
genetic disease. The elimination of a splice site by the mitochondrial
DNA required a change in splicing prediction models.

MUCOLIPIDOSIS IV
MCOLN1, 1704A-T

In a non-Ashkenazi Jewish girl with ML IV (252650), Dobrovolny et al.
(2007) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the MCOLN1
gene. One allele carried a 1704A-T transversion near the 3-prime end of
exon 13, resulting in erroneous splicing, a 4-bp deletion, and a
predicted protein product with the last 12 amino acids exchanged for 9
different ones. Both normal and pathologic splice forms were detected in
skin fibroblasts and leukocytes, with the normal form estimated at 40%,
presumably enough to prevent psychomotor retardation. The other allele
carried D362Y (605248.0005). The phenotype was unusual in that the
symptoms were restricted to the eyes, including corneal clouding and
decreased visual acuity. She had no neurologic abnormalities.
