601180	TITLE *601180 RAN-BINDING PROTEIN 1; RANBP1
;;HPAII TINY FRAGMENTS LOCUS 9A; HTF9A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Coutavas et al. (1993) isolated a Ran/TC4-binding protein, RanBP1, that
interacts specifically with GTP-charged RAN (601179). The authors cloned
the mouse RanBP1 cDNA by screening an expression library containing
cDNAs from 16-day mouse embryos.

Bischoff et al. (1995) identified a 23-kD protein, RANBP1, that binds to
RAN complexed with GTP but not GDP. Based on partial peptide sequence of
the purified protein, primers were designed to amplify a cDNA encoding
the protein. They also showed that RANBP1 does not activate GTPase
activity of RAN but does markedly increase GTP hydrolysis by the
RanGTPase-activating protein (RanGAP1).

Hayashi et al. (1995) isolated human RANBP1 using the 2-hybrid method
with either RAN or RCC1 (179710) as targets. The RANBP1 cDNA encodes a
201-amino acid protein that is 92% identical to its mouse homolog.
Hayashi et al. (1995) showed that, in both mammalian cells and in yeast,
RANBP1 acts as a negative regulator of RCC1 by inhibiting
RCC1-stimulated guanine nucleotide release from RAN. See also 601181.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Seewald et al. (2002) presented the 3-dimensional structure of a
Ran-RanBP1-RanGAP ternary complex in the ground state and in a
transition-state mimic. The structure and biochemical experiments showed
that RanGAP does not act through an arginine finger, that the basic
machinery for fast GTP hydrolysis is provided exclusively by Ran, and
that correct positioning of the catalytic glutamine is essential for
catalysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) found that mouse Htf9c (611151) and Ranbp1
were divergently transcribed from a bidirectional promoter. Expression
of both genes was activated upon entry into the cell cycle, peaked in S
phase, and was downregulated during completion of the cell cycle. The
bidirectional promoter was downregulated in both orientations in
arrested cells. Activation of the promoter was specific, resulting in
more restricted Htf9c expression and a sharper peak of Htf9c expression
in S phase compared with Ranbp1 expression. A region containing an E2f
(189971) site was important for cell cycle control of Htf9c, and a
common region containing sites for Sp1 (189906) and E2f contributed to
activation in both orientations.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Kikuno et al. (1999) cloned ANKHD1, which they designated
KIAA1085. The cDNA contains a short interspersed nuclear element (SINE)
in the 3-prime untranslated region (UTR). RT-PCR ELISA detected
intermediate to high expression in all adult and fetal tissues and
specific brain regions examined, with highest levels in adult heart,
lung, testis, and ovary.

Poulin et al. (2003) cloned 2 cDNAs containing sequences derived from
the human homolog of the Drosophila Mask (multiple ankyrin repeats,
single KH domain) gene. One cDNA contained only MASK sequences, while
the other was an intergenic splice variant containing exons from both
the MASK and 4EBP3 (EIF4EBP3; 603483) genes (see below). The MASK gene
encodes a deduced 2,542-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular
mass of 269.5 kD. The protein contains 2 blocks of ankyrin repeats (10
and 15 repeats, respectively) and a KH domain. Northern blot analysis
detected Mask in all mouse tissues examined. Western blot analysis
detected endogenous MASK at an apparent molecular mass of 270 kD in 293T
cells and in a human prostate carcinoma cell line.

Using human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) viral protein R (Vpr)
protein as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA
library, Miles et al. (2005) identified 2 splice variants of ANKHD1,
which they called VBARP (Vpr-binding ankyrin repeat protein)-L and
VBARP-S. The 1.9-kb VBARP-L transcript contains 11 exons encoding a
predominantly helical 627-amino acid protein. It contains 12 ankyrin
repeats, several potential serine, threonine, and tyrosine
phosphorylation sites, and 9 potential myristoylation sites, but lacks
the KH domain found in ANKHD1. The 1.3-kb VBARP-S contains 9 exons and
encodes a deduced 435-amino acid protein that is N-terminally truncated
compared with VBARP-L. Real time RT-PCR detected highest VBARP-L
expression in spleen, followed by lung, lymph node, and kidney, with
almost no expression in muscle and brain. VBARP-L was expressed at
variable levels in all cell lines examined, with highest expression in
dendritic cells. VBARP-L and VBARP-S were expressed as cytoplasmic
proteins in transfected HEK293 cells. By RT-PCR, Miles et al. (2005)
found highest expression of an 8.0-kb transcript designated ANKHD1
isoform 1 in cervix, followed by spleen, brain, and lung, with lower
levels in kidney, lymph node, and muscle.

- MASK-BP3 Intergenic Splice Variant

Poulin et al. (2003) identified MASK-BP3, an mRNA of approximately 8.5
kb that hybridized with a 4EBP3 probe in Northern blots and included
exons 1 through 33 of the MASK gene spliced to an intermediate exon 0,
and to 4EBP3 exons B and C. The transcript lacked MASK exon 34 and 4EBP3
exon A. The MASK-BP3 deduced 2,617-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 277.2 kD. The first 2,523 residues are identical to
those of MASK, and encompass the 2 blocks of ankyrin repeats as well as
the KH domain. The last 94 amino acids are translated from exons 0, B,
and C. Exons B and C of the MASK-BP3 transcript are translated in a
reading frame that differs from that of 4EBP3. Northern blot analysis of
several mouse tissues detected a Mask-bp3 homolog in all tissues
examined with higher expression in kidney and testis. Western blot
analysis detected both MASK and MASK-BP3 in a human prostate carcinoma
cell line, and both proteins migrated as approximately 270-kD proteins.

GENE FUNCTION

Miles et al. (2005) found that direction of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) against the VBARP variant of ANKHD1 resulted in apoptosis
following transfection in HeLa cells and in a human teratocarcinoma cell
line. The effect was dose- and time-dependent and was associated with
higher caspase-3 (CASP3; 600636) and caspase-7 (CASP7; 601761) activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Poulin et al. (2003) determined that the ANKHD1 gene contains 34 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Poulin et al. (2003) mapped the ANKHD1
gene to chromosome 5q31.3. ANKHD1 is flanked upstream by the SLC4A9 gene
(601209) and downstream by the EIF4EBP3 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Smith et al. (2002) found that in the Drosophila developing eye imaginal
disc, loss of Mask generated phenotypes similar to those generated by
loss of sevenless and Egfr (131550) in the receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling pathway. The phenotype included increased apoptosis, reduced
cell proliferation, and compromised photoreceptor differentiation. While
the loss of Mask also affected other receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent
processes, it did not affect Mapk (see 176948) activation. Smith et al.
(2002) concluded that MASK is a mediator of receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CHMP4A belongs to the chromatin-modifying protein/charged multivesicular
body protein (CHMP) family. These proteins are components of ESCRT-III
(endosomal sorting complex required for transport III), a complex
involved in degradation of surface receptor proteins and formation of
endocytic multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Some CHMPs have both nuclear and
cytoplasmic/vesicular distributions, and one such CHMP, CHMP1A (164010),
is required for both MVB formation and regulation of cell cycle
progression (Tsang et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using the N-terminal region of ALIX (PDCD6IP; 608074) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Katoh et al. (2003) cloned
CHMP4A. The deduced 223-amino acid protein has 3 coiled-coil regions, a
basic N-terminal half, and an acidic C-terminal half.

By Northern blot analysis, Katoh et al. (2004) detected a 1-kb CHMP4A
transcript in all tissues examined, with highest expression in heart and
moderate expression in skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver.

By PCR of a human melanoma cDNA library, Lin et al. (2005) cloned
CHMP4A, which they designated SNF7-1. They identified 2 PxxP motifs near
the C terminus of CHMP4A. Northern blot analysis detected CHMP4A
expression in all tissues examined, with highest levels in kidney,
liver, skeletal muscle, and heart.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Katoh et al. (2003) found that CHMP4A
interacted with ALIX.

Lin et al. (2005) found that overexpressed SNF7-1 associated with COS-7
cell membranes and perturbed normal multivesicular body biogenesis. The
N-terminal half of SNF7-1 localized to membranes and formed
detergent-resistant polymers, whereas the C-terminal half associated
with the ESCRT-III component SKD1 (VPS4B; 609983).

Tsang et al. (2006) performed a systematic yeast 2-hybrid analysis of
human ESCRT-III components, including CHMP4A. CHMP4A interacted with the
ESCRT-III protein VPS4A (609982) and with the signal transduction
molecule CC2D1A (610055).

In S. cerevisiae, ESCRT-III consists of Vps20 (610901), Snf7, Vps24
(610052), and Vps2 (610893), which assemble in that order and require
the ATPase Vps4 for their disassembly. Wollert et al. (2009)
reconstituted and visualized by fluorescence microscopy the
ESCRT-III-dependent budding and scission of intralumenal vesicles into
giant unilamellar vesicles. Wollert et al. (2009) showed that 3 subunits
of ESCRT-III, Vps20, Snf7, and Vps24, are sufficient to detach
intralumenal vesicles. Vps2, the ESCRT-III subunit responsible for
recruiting Vps4, and the ATPase activity of Vps4 were required for
ESCRT-III recycling and supported additional rounds of budding. The
minimum set of ESCRT-III and Vps4 proteins capable of multiple cycles of
vesicle detachment corresponds to the ancient set of ESCRT proteins
conserved from archaea to animals.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Katoh et al. (2003) mapped the CHMP4A gene
to chromosome 14q11.2.

602784	TITLE *602784 CORTISTATIN; CORT
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

De Lecea et al. (1996) identified cortistatin, a rat neuropeptide that
exhibits strong structural similarity to somatostatin (182450). The
14-amino acid neuropeptide is produced by cleavage of a 112-amino acid
precursor, preprocortistatin. Administration of cortistatin into brain
ventricles specifically enhances slow-wave sleep, presumably by
antagonizing the effects of acetylcholine on cortical excitability.

De Lecea et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding mouse and human
preprocortistatin. Sequence analysis revealed that the predicted rat and
mouse proteins share 82% identity, and the mature neuropeptides are
identical. Compared to rat and mouse cortistatin, the putative human
neuropeptide has a single amino acid substitution and 3 additional
N-terminal amino acids. Independently, Fukusumi et al. (1997) isolated a
human preprocortistatin cDNA. They noted that the predicted rat and
human proteins are 55% identical. The 105-amino acid human
preprocortistatin contains a 21-amino acid putative signal sequence.

By Northern blot analysis, de Lecea et al. (1997) determined that
preprocortistatin is expressed as 2 mRNAs in human and mouse brain.
Fukusumi et al. (1997) observed a single 1-kb band on Northern blots of
spinal cord and caudate nucleus mRNA, and faint bands in cerebral
cortex, hippocampus, and testis. Using in situ hybridization, de Lecea
et al. (1997) found that mouse preprocortistatin mRNA is present in
GABAergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.

GENE FUNCTION

Using chemically synthesized peptide and mammalian cells expressing
human somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), Fukusumi et al. (1997) showed that
human cortistatin inhibited the cAMP production induced by forskolin
through SSTRs, and bound SSTR subtypes in almost the same manner as rat
cortistatin. Administration of the human neuropeptide to rat cerebral
ventricle caused flattening of cortical and hippocampal
electroencephalograms, suggesting that it had sleep-modulating activity
similar to that of rat cortistatin.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ejeskar et al. (2000) determined that the CORT gene contains 2 exons
divided by a 1-kb intron.

MAPPING

By analysis of an interspecific backcross, de Lecea et al. (1997) mapped
the preprocortistatin gene to the distal portion of mouse chromosome 4
and, by homology of synteny, to chromosome 1p36 in humans. Ejeskar et
al. (2000) mapped the CORT gene to 1p36.3-p36.2 by radiation hybrid
analysis and BAC physical mapping.

ANIMAL MODEL

In a murine model of Crohn disease (see IBD1; 266600), Gonzalez-Rey et
al. (2006) demonstrated that cortistatin treatment significantly
ameliorated the clinical and histopathologic severity of inflammatory
colitis. The therapeutic effect was associated with downregulation of
inflammatory and Th1-driven autoimmune responses, including regulation
of a wide spectrum of inflammatory mediators. Gonzalez-Rey et al. (2006)
concluded that cortistatin is an antiinflammatory factor capable of
deactivating intestinal inflammatory response and restoring mucosal
immune tolerance at multiple levels.

Gonzalez-Rey et al. (2006) found that Cort protected mice with various
models of lethal endotoxemia from mortality and reduced related
histopathologic manifestations. The protection was further enhanced in a
synergistic manner by treatment with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP;
192320). Cort-treated macrophages stimulated with LPS produced less Tnf
(191160), Il6 (147620), and nitric oxide than controls. Gonzalez-Rey et
al. (2006) concluded that CORT represents a potential multistep
therapeutic agent for human septic shock.

604472	TITLE *604472 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR LIGAND SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 13; TNFSF13
;;APRIL;;
TNF- AND APOL-RELATED LEUKOCYTE EXPRESSED LIGAND 2; TALL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands play
important roles in various physiologic and pathologic processes,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death, and modulation
of immune responses. By screening EST databases, Hahne et al. (1998)
cloned a novel TNF cDNA, TNFSF13, which they called APRIL, for 'a
proliferation-inducing ligand.' The full-length cDNA TNFSF13 clone
encodes a 250-amino acid protein with a predicted 28-amino acid
cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and an
extracellular domain of 201 amino acids with no signal peptide. There is
only 1 N-linked glycosylation site. The sequence of the extracellular
domain shows 21% homology with TNFSF6 (134638) and 20% homology with
TNFA (191160). Northern blot analysis revealed weak expression
restricted to a few tissues: transcripts of 2.1 and 2.4 kb in prostate
and a transcript of 1.8 kb in peripheral blood leukocytes. All tumor
cell lines, however, strongly expressed the TNFSF13 2.1-kb transcript,
and expression of extracellular or full-length TNFSF13 led to increased
proliferation of various cell lines.

Shu et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they designated TALL2.
TALL2 shares about 35% sequence identity with TALL1 (BLYS, or TNFSF13B;
603969) in the C terminus.

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK (TNFSF12; 602695) to exons 2 through 6 of
APRIL. See 602695 for further information on the protein encoded by the
TWEAK/APRIL transcript, which Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) called
TWEPRIL.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Seyler et al. (2005) analyzed synovial tissue specimens from 72 patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (180300) for TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B production
and TNFSF13/TNFSF13B receptor expression. Synovitis with ectopic
germinal centers present had the highest levels of TNFSF13, produced
exclusively by CD83 (604534)-positive dendritic cells; TNFSF13B was
present in similar levels in all types of synovitis (with or without
germinal centers or T cell-B cell aggregates) and was produced
exclusively from CD68 (153634)-positive macrophages. In synovitis with
germinal centers, inhibiting TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B with a TACI
(TNFRSF13B; 604907):Fc fusion protein resulted in destruction of the
germinal centers and marked inhibition of IFN-gamma (147570) and Ig
transcription, whereas similar inhibition in the aggregate and diffuse
types of synovitis enhanced IFN-gamma production and did not affect Ig
levels. These differential immunomodulatory effects correlated with the
presence of TACI-positive T cells in aggregate and diffuse synovitis and
their absence in synovitis with germinal centers. Seyler et al. (2005)
proposed that TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B regulate B-cell as well as T-cell
function and have both pro- and antiinflammatory effects in rheumatoid
arthritis.

Both BLYS and APRIL have been described as homotrimeric molecules, a
feature common to many members of the TNF superfamily. Using ELISA
analysis, Roschke et al. (2002) found that patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700), rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, psoriatic
arthritis (see 607507), polymyositis (see 160750), and ankylosing
spondylitis (106300) had significantly higher levels of BLYS/APRIL
heterotrimers than did controls. Roschke et al. (2002) proposed that
BLYS/APRIL heterotrimers may play a role in rheumatic and other
autoimmune diseases, and that other members of the TNF ligand
superfamily may also form active soluble heterotrimers.

Using cell-based, biochemical, and structural studies, Hymowitz et al.
(2005) characterized interactions between APRIL and TACI. They found
that the short isoform of human TACI, which lacks cysteine-rich domain-1
(CRD1), was still functional for signaling and that CRD2 of TACI was
sufficient for high-affinity binding to either murine April or human
BAFF (TNFSF13B). The solution structure of CRD2 of TACI revealed a
compact domain and additional ligand-binding determinants. Cocrystal
structures of murine April bound to CRD2 of human TACI or to human BCMA
(TNFRSF17; 109545) showed large interfaces and revealed key differences
that likely influence ligand-binding affinity and specificity.

Ingold et al. (2005) showed that the TNF homology domain of mouse and
human APRIL bound BCMA and TACI, whereas a basic sequence (QKQKKQ) close
to the N terminus of the mature protein bound negatively charged
sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Although T-cell
lines bound little APRIL, ectopic expression of glycosaminoglycan-rich
syndecans (see SDC1; 186355) or glypicans (see GPC1; 600395) conferred
on these cells a high binding capacity that was completely dependent on
the N-terminal basic sequence of APRIL. Moreover, SDC1-positive plasma
cells and proteoglycan-rich nonhematopoietic cells displayed high
specific, heparin-sensitive binding to APRIL. Inhibition of BAFF and
APRIL, but not BAFF alone, prevented survival and/or migration of newly
formed plasma cells to bone marrow. In addition, costimulation of B-cell
proliferation by APRIL was only effective upon APRIL oligomerization.
Ingold et al. (2005) proposed that APRIL binding to the extracellular
matrix or to proteoglycan-positive cells induces APRIL oligomerization,
which is the prerequisite for triggering TACI- and/or BCMA-mediated
activation, migration, and survival signals.

Using flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemical
analysis, Huard et al. (2008) found that APRIL was expressed on
recruited neutrophils and accumulated on subepithelial heparan sulfate
proteoglycans in upper (e.g., tonsils) and lower (e.g., lamina propria)
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and contributed to survival of
plasma cells. Mice lacking April had less-persistent mucosal humoral
immunity. Huard et al. (2008) proposed that inflammation-recruited
neutrophils may create plasma cell niches in MALT to sustain local
antibody production.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF13 gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the transcriptional start
site of the TNFSF13 gene lies 878 bp downstream of the TNFSF12 gene on
chromosome 17p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

By treating mice with TACI-Ig, Gross et al. (2001) determined that BLYS
and APRIL are required for the development of both transitional (T2) and
mature B lymphocytes. TACI-Ig-treated mice also had less circulating
immunoglobulin and produced less collagen-specific antibody. TACI-Ig
treatment inhibited the development of collagen-induced rheumatoid
arthritis. Gross et al. (2001) proposed that TACI-Ig may have a role in
both the prevention and treatment of autoimmune disease mediated by
pathogenic autoantibodies.

Stein et al. (2002) created mice expressing human APRIL as a transgene
in T cells. These mice appeared normal. Transgenic T cells showed
enhanced survival in vitro and enhanced survival of staphylococcal
enterotoxin B-reactive Cd4-positive T cells in vivo, and both of these
responses correlated with elevated Bcl2 levels. Analysis of humoral
responses to T cell-dependent antigens in the transgenic mice indicated
that APRIL affected IgM responses, but not IgG responses. In contrast, T
cell-independent type-2 (TI-2) humoral responses were enhanced in APRIL
transgenic mice. As TACI had been reported to be indispensable for TI-2
antibody formation, Stein et al. (2002) concluded that APRIL-TACI
interactions have a role in generating the TI-2 response and that APRIL
is involved in the induction and/or maintenance of T- and B-cell
responses.

To investigate the role of APRIL in immunity, Castigli et al. (2004)
generated April-deficient mice. April -/- mice had normal T and B
lymphocyte development, normal T and B cell proliferation in vitro, but
increased numbers of CD4+ effector/memory T cells and increased IgG
responses to T-dependent antigens. Serum IgA levels were significantly
decreased, and serum IgA antibody responses to mucosal immunization with
T-dependent antigens and to type 1 T-independent antigens were impaired
in April -/- mice. The results suggested that APRIL downregulates T
cell-dependent antibody responses and promotes IgA class switching.

602842	TITLE *602842 GEMININ; GMNN
;;GEM
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

McGarry and Kirschner (1998) described a 25-kD protein, designated
geminin, which inhibits DNA replication and is degraded during the
mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Geminin contains 212 amino acids; it
has a destruction box sequence (RRTLKVIQP) and is ubiquitinated by the
anaphase-promoting complex in vitro.

GENE FUNCTION

In synchronized HeLa cells, McGarry and Kirschner (1998) demonstrated
that geminin is absent during G1 phase, accumulates during S, G2, and M
phases, and disappears at the time of the metaphase-anaphase transition.
Geminin inhibits DNA replication by preventing the incorporation of
minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex into prereplication complex.
McGarry and Kirschner (1998) proposed that geminin inhibits DNA
replication during S, G2, and M phases and that geminin destruction at
the metaphase-anaphase transition permits replication in the succeeding
cell cycle.

Wohlschlegel et al. (2000) demonstrated that geminin interacts tightly
with CDT1 (605525), a replication initiation factor necessary for MCM
loading. Inhibition of DNA replication by geminin in cell-free cDNA
replication extracts could be reversed by the addition of excess CDT1.
In the normal cell cycle, CDT1 is present only in G1 and S phases,
whereas geminin is present in S and G2 phases. Wohlschlegel et al.
(2000) concluded that their results suggest that geminin inhibits
inappropriate origin firing by targeting CDT1.

In a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Del Bene et al. (2004) identified the DNA
replication-inhibitor geminin as a partner of Six3 (603714). Geminin
inhibits cell cycle progression by sequestering Cdt1, the key component
for the assembly of the prereplication complex. Del Bene et al. (2004)
showed that Six3 efficiently competes with Cdt1 directly to bind to
geminin, which reveals how Six3 can promote cell proliferation without
transcription. In common with Six3 inactivation, overexpression of the
geminin gene in medaka induces specific forebrain and eye defects that
are rescued by Six3. Conversely, loss of Gem (in common with gain of
Six3) promotes retinal precursor-cell proliferation and results in
expanded optic vesicles, markedly potentiating Six3 gain-of-function
phenotypes. Del Bene et al. (2004) concluded that the transcription
factor Six3 and the replication-initiation inhibitor geminin act
antagonistically to control the balance between proliferation and
differentiation during early vertebrate eye development.

Luo et al. (2004) showed that murine geminin associates transiently with
members of the Hox-repressing polycomb complex, with the chromatin of
Hox regulatory DNA elements, and with Hox proteins. Gain- and
loss-of-function experiments in the chick neural tube demonstrated that
geminin modulates the anterior boundary of Hoxb9 (142964) transcription,
which suggests a polycomb-like activity for geminin. The interaction
between geminin and Hox proteins prevents Hox proteins from binding to
DNA, inhibits HOX-dependent transcriptional activation of reporter and
endogenous downstream target genes, and displaces Cdt1 (605525) from its
complex with geminin. By establishing competitive regulation, geminin
functions as a coordinator of developmental and proliferative control.

Initiation of DNA replication requires the assembly of a prereplication
complex (pre-RC) in late mitosis and G1, with sequential loading of the
origin recognition complex (see ORC1; 601902), CDC6 (602627), CDT1, and
the MCM2-7 complex (see MCM2; 116945) onto replication origins. Upon
initiation of DNA replication, the pre-RC is disassembled, and CDT1 and
CDC6 are released from the origins to prevent rereplication. Using human
cell lines, Shen et al. (2012) showed that ORCA (LRWD1; 615167) was
required for pre-RC assembly and replication initiation. Knockdown of
ORCA via small interfering RNA reduced association of ORC and MCM2-7
with chromatin and caused failure of cell cycle progression through S
phase. ORCA associated dynamically with different pre-RC components
during the cell cycle: it associated with ORC and CDT1 at G1, with
ORC(2-5) and geminin in S phase, and with ORC(2-5), phosphorylated CDT1,
and phosphorylated geminin during mitosis. ORCA interacted directly with
ORC2 (601182), CDT1, and geminin, and ORC2 was required for ORCA
stability. Overexpression of geminin reduced the affinity of CDT1 for
ORCA, and loss of association between ORCA and CDT1 appeared to be a key
step in disassembling the pre-RC at the end of G1 phase.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Lee et al. (2004) described the crystal structure of the mouse
geminin-Cdt1 (605525) complex using a truncated geminin involving
residues 79-157 and a truncated Cdt1 including residues 172-368. The
N-terminal region of a coiled-coil dimer of truncated geminin interacted
with both N-terminal and C-terminal parts of truncated Cdt1. The primary
interface relied on the steric complementarity between the truncated
geminin dimer and hydrophobic face of the 2 short N-terminal helices of
truncated Cdt1 and, in particular, pro181, ala182, tyr183, phe186, and
leu189. Lee et al. (2004) concluded that the crystal structure, in
conjunction with their biochemical data, indicated that the N-terminal
region of truncated geminin might be required to anchor truncated Cdt1,
and the C-terminal region of truncated geminin prevents access of the
MCM complex to truncated Cdt1 through steric hindrance.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the GMNN
gene to chromosome 6 (TMAP WI-12631).

ANIMAL MODEL

Gonzalez et al. (2006) did not find Gmnn-null mouse embryos at any
postimplantation stages of development. Ablation of Gmnn prevented
formation of the inner cell mass and caused premature endoreduplication
at 8 cells, rather than 32 cells. All cells in Gmnn-deficient embryos
committed to the trophoblast cell lineage and consisted of trophoblast
giant cells only. Gonzalez et al. (2006) concluded that degradation of
geminin during S and gap-like phases by proteasome-mediated degradation
is part of the mechanism regulating endoreduplication.

;;SMALL INDUCIBLE CYTOKINE SUBFAMILY A, MEMBER 24; SCYA24;;

EOTAXIN 2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chemokines are a family of small cytokines that stimulate
proinflammatory activity by attracting leukocytes. Beta-chemokines are
characterized by a C-C motif (2 contiguous cysteines). Patel et al.
(1997) identified 2 beta-chemokines by searching ESTs for conserved
beta-chemokine motifs, and designated them MPIF1 (602494) and MPIF2.
MPIF2 encodes a predicted 119-amino acid protein containing a 26-amino
acid N-terminal signal peptide. The MPIF2 protein, which migrates as a
10.5-kD band on SDS-PAGE, is most closely related to that of MCP3 (39%
identity; 158106) and MIP-1-alpha (42% identity; 182283). MPIF2
expression was undetectable on Northern blots, but was found by RT-PCR
in activated monocytes and T lymphocytes.

GENE FUNCTION

Patel et al. (1997) found that MPIF2 had chemotactic activity on resting
T lymphocytes and lower activity on neutrophils. MPIF2 was a strong
suppressor of colony formation by a multipotential hematopoietic
progenitor cell line.

Menzies-Gow et al. (2002) used immunohistological analysis to examined
the effects of intradermal injection of eotaxin (CCL11; 601156) and
eotaxin-2, both of which act through CCR3 (601268), into human atopic
and nonatopic skin. Both chemokines produced a dose- and time-dependent
local eosinophilia of comparable intensity and an acute wheal and flare
response regardless of atopy status. Basophils and neutrophils also
accumulated at the injection sites. Menzies-Gow et al. (2002) concluded
that the eosinophilic and inflammatory cell infiltrate induced by
eotaxins is consistent with CC chemokine-induced mast cell
degranulation.

MAPPING

By use of PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrid DNAs, radiation hybrid
mapping, and a chromosome 7-specific YAC library, Nomiyama et al. (1998)
mapped the SCYA24 gene to chromosome 7q11.23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The eotaxin gene family (eotaxin 1; eotaxin 2; and eotaxin 3, 604697)
recruits and activates CCR3-bearing cells such as eosinophils, mast
cells, and Th2 lymphocytes that play a major role in allergic disorders.
Shin et al. (2003) genotyped a 721-member asthma (600807) cohort at 17
polymorphisms among the 3 eotaxin loci. Statistical analysis revealed
that the eotaxin 2 +1272A-G G* allele showed significantly lower
frequency in asthmatics than in normal healthy controls (0.14 versus
0.23, P=0.002), and that distribution of the eotaxin 2 +1272A-G G*
allele-containing genotypes was also much lower in asthmatics (26.3
versus 40.8%, P = 0.003). In addition, a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in eotaxin 1, +123Ala to Thr, showed significant
association with total serum IgE levels (P = 0.002-0.02) (see 147050).
The effect of eotaxin 1 +123Ala to Thr on total serum IgE appeared in a
gene dose-dependent manner. The authors suggested that the development
of asthma may be associated with eotaxin 2 +1272A-G polymorphisms, and
the susceptibility to high IgE production may be attributed to the
eotaxin 1 +123Ala to Thr polymorphism. In an erratum, the authors noted
that the first base of the translation start site of the eotaxin 2
genomic reference sequence had been denoted as +1, introducing some
errors in the numbering of the eotaxin 2 SNPs.

Min et al. (2005) found that plasma eotaxin-2 levels were increased in
asthmatics compared to healthy controls, and that the increased levels
were proportional to the number of 1272A-G alleles. Min et al. (2005)
suggested that plasma eotaxin-2 may have a protective effect against the
development of asthma via desensitization.

In the course of the molecular characterization of the translocation
t(10;11)(p13;q14) in the monocytic cell line U937, Dreyling et al.
(1996) identified a breakpoint on chromosome 11 involving the previously
unknown gene, CALM. CALM has a very high homology to the murine clathrin
assembly protein ap3 (Morris et al., 1993).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Ford et al. (2001) presented the structure of the N-terminal domain of
CALM bound to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate via a lysine-rich
motif. This motif is found in other proteins predicted to have domains
of similar structure (e.g., Huntingtin-interacting protein-1; 601767).
The structure is in part similar to the epsin (607262) N-terminal (ENTH)
domain, but epsin lacks the
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate-binding site.

Mao et al. (2001) determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal
domain (the NAP domain) of the Drosophila Lap protein, which is
homologous to human PICALM. The structure revealed a novel fold
consisting of a large double layer of sheets of 10 alpha helices and a
unique site for binding phosphoinositides.

CYTOGENETICS

- PICALM/AF10 Fusion Gene

Dreyling et al. (1996) identified a breakpoint on chromosome 11
involving the CALM gene in the translocation t(10;11)(p13;q14) in the
monocytic cell line U937. The fusion partner of the CALM gene on
chromosome 11 was the putative transcription factor AF10 (602409)
located on 10p13. Dreyling et al. (1998) found that both MLL (159555)
and CALM are fused to AF10 in morphologically distinct subsets of acute
leukemia with t(10;11). Both rearrangements were associated with a poor
prognosis.

Bohlander et al. (2000) and Carlson et al. (2000) performed molecular
analyses of the CALM/AF10 fusion in cases of leukemia. Bohlander et al.
(2000) studied a series of 3 patients with AML, 1 patient with T-ALL,
and 2 patients with precursor T lymphoblastic lymphoma. The
rearrangements were essentially identical in all. In all 6 patients the
breakpoint in CALM was at the 3-prime end of the coding region. Three
breakpoints could be identified in AF10. The findings indicated that
CALM/AF10 fusions differ only slightly with respect to the portion of
AF10 present and that there is no obvious difference between the fusions
found in AML patients compared to those found in patients with lymphoid
malignancies. Carlson et al. (2000) studied 6 patients with myeloid
leukemia and 3 with T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. They identified 4
different CALM/AF10 fusion products in 5 patients and AF10/CALM
reciprocal message in 1. Carlson et al. (2000) concluded that the fusion
of CALM and AF10 is a recurring abnormality in both lymphoid and myeloid
leukemias of various types including AML-M5; that the breakpoints in the
2 types of leukemia do not differ; and that the CALM/AF10 fusion product
on the derivative chromosome 10 is critical to leukemogenesis.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For a discussion of a possible association between variation in the
PICALM gene and late-onset Alzheimer disease, see 104300.

ANIMAL MODEL

Treusch et al. (2011) modeled amyloid-beta (see 104760) toxicity in
yeast by directing the peptide to the secretory pathway. A genomewide
screen for toxicity modifiers identified the yeast homolog of PICALM and
other endocytic factors connected to Alzheimer disease (104300) whose
relationship to amyloid-beta had been unknown. The factors identified in
yeast modified amyloid-beta toxicity in glutamatergic neurons of C.
elegans and in primary rat cortical neurons. In yeast, amyloid-beta
impaired the endocytic trafficking of a plasma membrane receptor, which
was ameliorated by endocytic pathway factors identified in the yeast
screen. Treusch et al. (2011) concluded that links between amyloid-beta,
endocytosis, and human Alzheimer disease risk factors can be ascertained
with yeast as a model system.

NOMENCLATURE

Mao et al. (2001) referred to PICALM as 'the human AP180.' However, the
true homolog of AP180 is SNAP91 (607923), a paralog of PICALM.

;;ACTSG;;
ACTE;;
ACTIN, ALPHA-3, FORMERLY; ACTA3, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Miwa et al. (1991) isolated recombinant phages that carried the human
smooth muscle (enteric) gamma-actin gene (which they symbolized ACTSG)
from human genomic DNA libraries.

Ueyama et al. (1995) isolated genomic clones containing the ACTG2 gene,
which has also been symbolized ACTA3.

Szucsik and Lessard (1995) characterized the mouse smooth muscle
(enteric) gamma-actin gene. It represented the largest isoactin gene
characterized to that time, measuring over 23,000 bp from the
transcription start site to the polyadenylation signal. The gene encodes
a mature actin protein of 374 amino acids.

GENE STRUCTURE

Miwa et al. (1991) determined that the human ACTG2 gene contains one
5-prime untranslated exon and 8 coding exons extending for 27 kb.

Szucsik and Lessard (1995) determined that the mouse Actg2 gene contains
9 exons.

GENE FAMILY

From the characterized molecular structures of the 6 human actin isoform
genes, Miwa et al. (1991) proposed a hypothesis of the evolutionary
pathway of the actin gene family. Each of the 5 other actin genes maps
to a separate chromosome.

MAPPING

Miwa et al. (1991) mapped the human ACTG2 gene to chromosome 2 by study
of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids. Ueyama et al. (1995) mapped the
ACTG2 gene to 2p13.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

GENETIC VARIABILITY

Ueyama et al. (1995) demonstrated that the HindIII RFLP in the first
intron of the ACTG2 gene is due to the presence/absence of a 24-bp
sequence harboring a HindIII restriction site. A biallelic system was
found to have allelic frequencies of 45 (HindIII-minus):55
(HindIII-Plus).

By studying lymphoblastoid cells, Cheung et al. (2003) studied natural
variation in human gene expression. The variance ratio of 813 genes
ranged from 0.4 to 64 with a median value of 2.5. In an examination of
the actual variances of expression levels of ACTG2 and 4 other highly
variable genes, ACTG2 showed the highest variance ratio; in 35 persons
studied, its expression level varied by a factor of 17. In an
examination of the gene transcript levels of ACTG2 and 4 other highly
variable genes among 3 groups of people (49 unrelated individuals,
offspring from 5 CEPH families, and 10 pairs of monozygotic twins), the
variance among unrelated individuals was 3 to 11 times greater than that
between monozygotic twins, and the variance among sibs was 2 to 5 times
greater than that between twins.

607376	TITLE *607376 DYNACTIN 2; DCTN2
;;DYNAMITIN;;
DYNACTIN COMPLEX, 50-KD SUBUNIT; DCTN50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DCTN2 is a 50-kD subunit of dynactin, a multiprotein complex associated
with dynein. Cytoplasmic dynein is a molecular motor responsible for
minus-end-directed movement along microtubules. See DCTN1 (601143) and
DNCH1 (600112) for additional information about the dynactin complex and
dynein.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DCTN2
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH70660).

ANIMAL MODEL

LaMonte et al. (2002) generated a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400) by overexpressing dynamitin in postnatal motor
neurons of transgenic mice. They found that dynamitin overexpression
disrupted the dynein-dynactin complex, resulting in an inhibition of
retrograde axonal transport. The authors observed a late-onset, slowly
progressive motor neuron degenerative disease in the transgenic mice and
concluded that their mouse model confirms the critical role of disrupted
axonal transport in the pathogenesis of motor neuron degenerative
disease.

603940	TITLE *603940 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, SUBFAMILY K, MEMBER 7; KCNK7
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tandem pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, such
as TWIK1 (601745) and TREK (603219), contain 4 transmembrane domains and
2 pore-forming (P) domains. See KCNK6 (603939). By searching an EST
database for sequences related to mouse Kcnk6, Salinas et al. (1999)
isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel potassium channel, which they
designated KCNK7. RT-PCR revealed that exon skipping gives rise to 5
mRNA species encoding 3 protein forms, KCNK7-A, -B, and -C. The
predicted 307-amino acid KCNK7A form is the longest; KCNK7B and KCNK7C
have truncated cytoplasmic C termini. Sequence analysis revealed that
the KCNK7 protein contains 4 potential transmembrane segments and 2 P
domains. The P2 domain contains a very unconventional GLE motif instead
of the GLG found in TWIK1 and KCNK6 or the GFG found in other K2P
channels. The core region spanning the 4 transmembrane domains of KCNK7A
shares 80% and 42% protein sequence identity with those of Kcnk6 and
TWIK1, respectively. As with Kcnk6, none of the KCNK7 protein forms were
able to generate channel activity when expressed in mammalian cells.

MAPPING

By analysis of radiation hybrids, Salinas et al. (1999) mapped the KCNK7
gene to 11q13.

162096	TITLE *162096 MIDKINE; MDK
;;MIDGESTATION AND KIDNEY; MK;;
NEURITE GROWTH-PROMOTING FACTOR 2, FORMERLY; NEGF2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Midkine is a retinoic acid-responsive, heparin-binding growth factor
expressed in various cell types during embryogenesis. It promotes
angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell migration. Midkine is also expressed
in several carcinomas, suggesting that it may play a role in
tumorigenesis, perhaps through its effects on angiogenesis (summary by
Reynolds et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using mouse Mk to screen a midgestation human embryonic kidney cDNA
library, followed by screening a placenta genomic library, Tsutsui et
al. (1991) cloned human MDK, which they called MK. The deduced 121-amino
acid protein has a signal sequence and shares 87% identity with mouse
Mk. Orthologs of MK were detected in rat, cow, and chicken. The chicken
ortholog, Rihb, is a retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein. MK
shares about 50% amino acid homology with the human heparin-binding
protein pleiotrophin (PTN; 162095), with highest conservation in the
central part of the molecule and complete conservation of cysteine
residues. Northern blot analysis detected a transcript of about 1 kb in
adult human kidney and PA1 human teratocarcinoma cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Reynolds et al. (2004) found that hypoxia induced midkine expression in
alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary vasculature in a strain of mice
sensitive to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced expression of both HIF1-alpha
(603348) and midkine in human placental adenocarcinoma, mouse fetal lung
mesenchyme, and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell lines. HIF1-alpha
induced midkine expression via regulatory elements in the mouse midkine
promoter. Chronic expression of midkine during embryonic development in
transgenic mice resulted in pulmonary arterial remodeling and
muscularization, but only during the postnatal phase of lung
development. In fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells and transgenic mice,
midkine upregulated expression of myocardin (MYOCD; 606127), a regulator
of smooth muscle cell differentiation.

Intraperitoneal adhesions between organs or between organs and
peritoneal walls occur in more than 90% of cases involving major
abdominal operations. Using a model of postoperative adhesions and
Mk-null mice, Inoh et al. (2004) showed that midkine was fundamentally
involved in the formation of intraperitoneal adhesions, at least partly
by promoting migration of macrophages and neutrophils to the omentum.

Hobo et al. (2009) found that 5/6 nephrectomy in mice, a model of
chronic kidney disease, induced expression of midkine in lung, leading
to elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; 106180) activity and
plasma angiotensin II (106150) levels and subsequent hypertension.
Exposure to midkine enhanced ACE expression in primary cultured human
lung microvascular endothelial cells. Oxidative stress may have
contributed to midkine expression, since 5/6 nephrectomy induced
expression of NADH/NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX1; 300225), Nox2 (CYBB; 300481),
and Nox4 (605261). Furthermore, an antioxidant reduced midkine
expression and plasma angiotensin II levels and ameliorated hypertension
in 5/6 nephrectomized mice.

GENE STRUCTURE

Uehara et al. (1992) determined that the MDK gene contains 4 exons. The
5-prime flanking region adjacent to the start site contains 5 GC boxes,
a steroid/thyroid hormone receptor-binding site, and an A/T-rich island,
but there is no obvious CAAT box. Further upstream there is a region
with high GC content. The mouse Mdk gene has a similar organization,
with conservation of exons and significant homology in the 5-prime
region adjacent to the start site. There are 3 additional regions of
homology between mouse and human MDK in the 5-prime UTR.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Eddy et al. (1991) demonstrated that
the MDK gene segregates concordantly with chromosome 11 and, using cell
hybrids carrying translocations involving chromosome 11, they mapped the
gene regionally to 11p13-p11. Kaname et al. (1993) mapped the MDK gene
to human chromosome 11p11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Simon-Chazottes et al. (1992) mapped the mouse Mdk gene to chromosome 2,
using an interspecific backcross panel and microsatellite polymorphisms
as markers. O'Hara et al. (1995) used somatic cell hybrid analysis and
interspecific backcross analysis, respectively, to map human Mdk to
chromosome 11p13-p11 and mouse Mdk to a syntenic region of mouse
chromosome 2. They also mapped an Mdk pseudogene to mouse chromosome 11.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using microarray analysis, Ezquerra et al. (2005) found that aortae of
Mk -/- mice showed elevated expression of renin (REN; 179820),
angiotensinogen (106150), angiotensin II receptor-1 (AGTR1; 106165), and
angiotensin II receptor-2 (AGTR2; 300034) and decreased expression of
Ace.

108732	TITLE *108732 ATPase, Ca(2+)-TRANSPORTING, PLASMA MEMBRANE, 4; ATP2B4
;;PLASMA MEMBRANE Ca(2+)-ATPase, TYPE 4; PMCA4;;
ATP2B2, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The Ca(2+)-ATPases are a family of plasma membrane pumps encoded by at
least 4 genes: ATP2B1 (108731) on chromosome 12q21; ATP2B2 (108733) on
3q26; ATP2B3 (300014) on Xq28; and ATP2B4.

CLONING

By PCR, Brandt et al. (1992) detected expression of the PMCA4a variant
in all tissues examined. They identified a second variant, PMCA4b, that
was primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, small intestine, heart,
spinal cord, and brain. Brandt et al. (1992) isolated the full-length
PMCA4b cDNA from a fetal brain cDNA library. The deduced 473-amino acid
protein lacks a large portion of the C terminus found in PMCA4a.

By RT-PCR, Santiago-Garcia et al. (1996) found variable expression of
the PMCA and SERCA (see 108730) genes during human fetal heart
development. PMCA4 and PMCA1 were expressed in 8-, 12-, and 20-week
fetal heart and in adult heart. Two PMCA4 splice variants were detected
in heart tissue, whereas only 1 was detected in placenta.

Okunade et al. (2004) examined Pmca1 and Pmca4 expression in mouse
tissues. Pmca1 was expressed in all tissues examined, and Pmca4 was
expressed in all tissues examined except liver. Pmca1 predominated in
brain, intestine, kidney, lung, and stomach, whereas Pmca4 predominated
in aorta, portal vein, bladder, diaphragm, seminal vesicles, and testis.
Immunostaining localized Pmca4 to the principal piece of the sperm tail,
the location of Catsper (606389), the major Ca(2+) channel required for
sperm motility.

MAPPING

Olson et al. (1991) mapped the PMCA4 gene to chromosome 1q25-q32 by
Southern analysis of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, in situ
hybridization of human metaphase spreads, and genetic linkage analysis
in the CEPH pedigrees. No evidence was obtained for multiple copies of
the gene at this locus; however, a cross-hybridizing sequence was
detected on Xq13-qter at low stringency.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Associations Pending Confirmation

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the ATP2B4
gene and resistance to severe malaria, see 611162.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chen et al. (2004) expressed mouse Cd22 (107266) in mouse and chicken
B-cell lines devoid of Cd22 and examined B cells from mice deficient in
Cd22 or Pmca4. They identified an activation-dependent interaction
between phosphorylated Cd22 and Pmca4 and found that Cd22 together with
Shp1 (PTPN6; 176883) provided negative control of B-cell activation by
enhancing Pmca4-mediated calcium efflux after B-cell receptor
stimulation.

Okunade et al. (2004) found that loss of both copies of the mouse Pmca4
gene resulted in no overt phenotype. Loss of Pmca4 impaired phasic
contractions and caused apoptosis in portal vein smooth muscle in vitro,
but this phenotype was dependent on the mouse strain employed. On a
Black Swiss background, the phenotype was not expressed unless the mice
also carried a null mutation in 1 copy of the Pmca1 gene. Pmca4 -/- male
mice were infertile but had normal spermatogenesis and mating behavior.
Pmca4 -/- sperm that had not undergone capacitation exhibited normal
motility but did not achieve hyperactivated motility needed to traverse
the female genital tract. Ultrastructure of the motility apparatus of
mutant sperm tails showed mitochondrial condensation, indicating Ca(2+)
overload. Okunade et al. (2004) concluded that PMCA4 expression in the
principal piece of sperm tail is essential for hyperactivated motility
and male fertility.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLK8 belongs to the kallikrein subgroup of serine proteases, which have
diverse physiologic functions in many tissues. For background
information on kallikreins, see 147960.

CLONING

By searching an EST database, followed by PCR on hippocampus and
keratinocyte cDNA and RACE, Yoshida et al. (1998) isolated a cDNA
encoding KLK8, the human homolog of mouse neuropsin. The deduced
260-amino acid protein, 72% identical to the mouse sequence, has an
N-terminal signal peptide, conserved residues for protease activity, an
N-linked glycosylation site, and 13 cys residues. Northern blot analysis
detected a 0.9-kb transcript in keratinocytes.

Using a similar strategy, Mitsui et al. (1999) obtained cDNAs encoding
260- and 305-amino acid KLK8 isoforms, which they termed type-1 and
type-2 neuropsin, respectively. Sequence analysis determined that type 2
has a 45-residue leucine- and proline-rich insert at the C terminus of
the putative leader sequence of type 1. Mouse and human genomic sequence
analysis indicated that type 2 is a species-specific splice variant for
humans. Northern blot analysis revealed that type 1 is most intensely
expressed in pancreas, with lower expression in placenta, whereas type 2
is expressed in brain, suggesting organ-specific alternative splicing.
RT-PCR analysis detected type 2 expression in hippocampus. Dot blot
hybridization demonstrated expression of type 2 in all investigated
areas of the brain. Western blot analysis showed that type-1 and type-2
neuropsin are secreted as 35- and 38-kD proteins, respectively, from
insect cells.

By RT-PCR analysis using degenerate primers for serine proteases in
normal ovary and ovarian carcinoma, Underwood et al. (1999) identified a
cDNA encoding KLK8, which they called TADG14. Database searching showed
that TADG14 is identical to the 280-amino acid human neuropsin at the
protein but not the cDNA level. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.4-kb
transcript that was highly overexpressed in 20 of 30 ovarian carcinomas
studied. Western blot analysis detected a 30-kD protein in tumor cell
lines. Immunohistochemical analysis detected KLK8 in carcinoma but not
normal ovarian tissue. Underwood et al. (1999) suggested that
circulating KLK8 may be a useful marker for early detection of ovarian
carcinoma.

By RT-PCR of 35 adult and fetal tissues, Gan et al. (2000) detected
highest KLK8 expression in adult skin. Most other tissues showed weak
KLK8 expression.

Kishi et al. (2003) demonstrated K8 protein in ovarian cancer tissue
extracts, serum, and ascites fluid, suggesting that it may serve as a
new ovarian cancer marker.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Yoshida et al. (1998) determined that KLK8
is a single-copy gene that contains 6 exons and spans 5.4 kb. Promoter
analysis revealed atypical TATA and CCAAT box sequences.

GENE FUNCTION

Attwood et al. (2011) demonstrated in mice that the serine protease
neuropsin is critical for stress-related plasticity in the amygdala by
regulating the dynamics of the EphB2-NMDA receptor interaction, the
expression of Fkbp5 (602623), and anxiety-like behavior. Stress results
in neuropsin-dependent cleavage of EphB2 in the amygdala, causing
dissociation of EphB2 from the NR1 (138249) subunit of the NMDA receptor
and promoting membrane turnover of EphB2 receptors. Dynamic EphB2-NR1
interaction enhances NMDA receptor current, induces Fkpb5 gene
expression, and enhances behavioral signatures of anxiety. On stress,
neuropsin-deficient mice do not show EphB2 cleavage and its dissociation
from NR1, resulting in a static EphB2-NR1 interaction, attenuated
induction of the Fkbp5 gene, and low anxiety. The behavioral response to
stress can be restored by intraamygdala injection of neuropsin into
neuropsin-deficient mice and disrupted by the injection of either
anti-EphB2 antibodies or silencing the Fkbp5 gene in the amygdala of
wildtype mice. Attwood et al. (2011) concluded that their findings
established a novel neuronal pathway linking stress-induced proteolysis
of EphB2 in the amygdala to anxiety.

MAPPING

Harvey et al. (2000) mapped the KLK8 gene to chromosome 19q13.4 in the
KLK gene cluster between KLK7 (604438) and KLK9 (605504). They noted
that KLK5 (605643) to KLK14 are transcribed telomere to centromere.

EVOLUTION

Lu et al. (2007) demonstrated that type-2 KLK8 is absent from nonhuman
primates, indicating that it is human specific. In vitro splicing assays
revealed a human-specific mutation that triggers the change in splicing
pattern, and mutation assays showed that this mutation is necessary and
sufficient for type-2 KLK8 expression.

603167	TITLE *603167 BCL2 ANTAGONIST OF CELL DEATH; BAD
;;BCL2-BINDING PROTEIN; BCL2L8;;
BCL2-BINDING COMPONENT 6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Protein interactions among different pro- and antiapoptotic members of
the BCL2 (151430) family are central to their regulation of apoptosis.
These interactions are chiefly influenced by alpha-helical segments
known as BCL2 homology (BH) domains. Some proapoptotic and all
antiapoptotic BCL2 family members share homology within 3 to 4 BH
domains, whereas the BH3-only proapoptotic proteins share homology
within a single BH3 domain. BAD is a BH3-only protein that alternately
functions in apoptosis and metabolism depending upon the availability of
growth factors and nutrients. The switch between apoptotic and metabolic
functions of BAD is controlled by phosphorylation (summary by Danial,
2009).

CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse embryonic cDNA fusion library,
Yang et al. (1995) obtained a cDNA encoding a novel Bcl2-binding
protein, termed Bad for 'Bcl2 antagonist of cell death.' The 204-amino
acid murine protein has sequence similarity to members of the BCL2
family within the BH1 and BH2 domains.

Wang et al. (1996) used PCR based on EST sequences to clone a fragment
of the human BAD cDNA.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to mouse Bad,
followed by screening substantia nigra, bone marrow, and placenta cDNA
libraries, Ottilie et al. (1997) cloned full-length human BAD. The
deduced 168-amino acid protein shares 74% identity with mouse Bad, but
it lacks 42 N-terminal amino acids found in the mouse protein. Ottilie
et al. (1997) noted that the met start codon of human BAD satisfies
Kozak criteria, and that no human BAD variants encoding an N-terminally
extended protein were identified. Alignment of BAD with other BCL2
family proteins revealed a single putative BH3 domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Yang et al. (1995) found that mouse Bad heterodimerized strongly with
Bclx (600039) and less strongly with Bcl2, but it did not bind to other
members of the family. At similar levels of expression, Bad countered
the death repressor activity of Bclx, but not that of Bcl2. Functional
studies revealed that when Bad dimerized with Bclx, it displaced Bax
(600040) and restored its apoptosis-inducing ability. The authors
suggested that BAD may influence the effectiveness of BCL2 versus BCLX
in repressing cell death.

Wang et al. (1996) showed that the human BAD protein was phosphorylated
by the protein kinase RAF1 (164760), which had been targeted by BCL2 to
the mitochondrial membrane.

Using yeast 2-hybrid and solid-phase binding assays, Ottilie et al.
(1997) showed that human BAD dimerized strongly with the long BCLX
isoform (BCLXL) and more weakly with BCL2. BAD did not bind the short
BCLX isoform (BCLXS), BAX, or BAK (600516), and it did not homodimerize.
Competition studies revealed that the BH3 domains of BAD, BCLXL, and
BCL2 were required for heterodimerization. BAD increased the number of
apoptotic cells when transfected into human HEK293 cells, and it
cancelled the prosurvival effect of BCLXL in GM701 human fibroblasts.

Bonni et al. (1999) characterized the mechanism by which the RAS (see
190020)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (see
602448) mediates growth factor-dependent cell survival. The
MAP-activated kinases, the Rsks (see 300075), catalyzed the
phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD at ser112 both in vitro
and in vivo. The Rsk-induced phosphorylation of BAD at ser112 suppressed
BAD-mediated apoptosis in neurons.

Danial et al. (2003) undertook a proteomic analysis to assess whether
BAD might participate in mitochondrial physiology. In liver
mitochondria, BAD resides in a functional holoenzyme complex together
with protein kinase A (see 176911) and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1; see
176875) catalytic units, WAVE1 (605035) as an A kinase-anchoring
protein, and glucokinase (138079). Using mitochondria from hepatocytes
of Bad-deficient mice, Danial et al. (2003) demonstrated that BAD is
required to assemble the complex, the lack of which results in
diminished mitochondria-based glucokinase activity and blunted
mitochondrial respiration in response to glucose. Glucose deprivation
results in dephosphorylation of BAD, and BAD-dependent cell death.
Moreover, Danial et al. (2003) demonstrated that the phosphorylation
status of BAD helps regulate glucokinase activity. Mice deficient in BAD
or bearing a nonphosphorylatable BAD (3SA) mutant (Datta et al., 2002)
display abnormal glucose homeostasis, including profound defects in
glucose tolerance. Danial et al. (2003) concluded that this combination
of proteomics, genetics, and physiology indicates an unanticipated role
for BAD in integrating pathways of glucose metabolism and apoptosis.

- Reviews

Danial (2009) reviewed the roles of BAD in apoptosis and metabolism, as
well as its regulation by phosphorylation.

MAPPING

Gross (2010) mapped the BAD gene to chromosome 11q13.1 based on an
alignment of the BAD sequence (GenBank GENBANK AB451254) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Ranger et al. (2003) reported that Bad-deficient mice lacking both long
and short Bad proteins were viable, and most cell types appeared to
develop normally. Lymphocytes developed normally with no premalignant
hyperplasia, but they displayed subtle abnormalities in proliferation
and IgG production. Despite the minimal phenotype, Bad-deficient mice
progressed, with aging, to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of germinal
center origin. Exposure of Bad-null mice to sublethal gamma irradiation
resulted in an increased incidence of pre-T-cell and pro-/pre-B-cell
lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Thus, proapoptotic BAD suppresses
tumorigenesis in the lymphocyte lineage.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by PCR of a human kidney cDNA library,
Wang et al. (2005) cloned SPSB2, which they called SSB2. The deduced
263-amino acid protein shares 50% amino acid identity with SPSB1
(611657). SPSB2 contains a central SPRY domain and a C-terminal SOCS
box. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that SPSB2 interacted with MET
(164860).

300110	TITLE *300110 CALCIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT, ALPHA-1F SUBUNIT; CACNA1F
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The human Xp11.23-p11.22 interval is involved in several hereditary
diseases. Fisher et al. (1997) noted that in constructing YAC contigs
spanning this region, it was found that the region of Xp surrounding the
synaptophysin gene (SYP; 313475) was refractory to cloning in YACs, but
highly stable in cosmids. Preliminary analysis of the cosmid suggested a
high density of coding sequences and prompted complete sequencing of an
SYP-containing cosmid. Fisher et al. (1997) identified 29 putative exons
organized into 3 genes, in addition to the 7 exons of the complete SYP
coding region, all mapping within a 44-kb interval. Two genes were
novel: one (CACNA1F) shows high homology to alpha-1 subunits of calcium
channels (see CACNA2; 114204), whereas the other (LMO6; 300111) encodes
a product with significant similarity to LIM-domain proteins. RT-PCR and
Northern blot studies confirmed that these loci were indeed transcribed.
The third locus (A4; 300112) had been previously described but not
localized to a specific chromosomal site. The region has an elevated GC
content (more than 53%), and Fisher et al. (1997) identified CpG islands
associated with the 5-prime ends of SYP, A4, and LMO6.

Naylor et al. (2000) cloned the mouse Cacna1f gene. The deduced
1,985-amino acid channel protein shares 90% identity with the
1,977-amino acid human protein, with almost perfect conservation between
the functional domains and only a single amino acid substitution within
the transmembrane segments. RT-PCR of several mouse tissues detected
Cacna1f expression only in eye. In situ hybridization detected Cacna1f
in the outer nuclear layer, the inner nuclear layer, and the ganglion
cell layer of mouse retina.

GENE FUNCTION

To study the electrophysiologic and pharmacologic properties of the
L-type calcium channel CACNA1F, Baumann et al. (2004) cloned and
functionally expressed the complete Cacna1f cDNA from the mouse retina.
The data indicated that CACNA1F constitutes the major molecular
correlate of the retinal L-type calcium current. Its intrinsic
biophysical properties, in particular its unique inactivation
properties, enable it to provide a sustained calcium current over the
voltage range required for tonic glutamate release at the photoreceptor
synapse.

Liu et al. (2010) combined electrophysiology to characterize channel
regulation with optical fluorescence resonance energy transfer sensor
determination of free-apocalmodulin (CALM1; 114180) concentration in
live cells. This approach translates quantitative calmodulin
biochemistry from the traditional test-tube context into the realm of
functioning holochannels within intact cells. From this perspective, Liu
et al. (2010) found that long splice forms of Ca(V)1.3 (CACNA1D; 114206)
and Ca(V)1.4 (CACNA1F) channels include a distal carboxy tail that
resembles an enzyme competitive inhibitor that retunes channel affinity
for apocalmodulin such that natural calmodulin variations affect the
strength of Ca(2+) feedback modulation. Given the ubiquity of these
channels, the connection between ambient calmodulin levels and Ca(2+)
entry through channels is broadly significant for Ca(2+) homeostasis.

MAPPING

Fisher et al. (1997) determined that the order of loci in the
Xp11.23-p11.22 interval is Xpter-A4-LMO6-SYP-CACNA1F-Xcen, with
intergenic distances ranging from approximately 300 bp to approximately
5 kb. The density of transcribed sequences in this area (more than 80%)
is comparable to that found in the highly gene-rich band Xq28.

Naylor et al. (2000) mapped the mouse Cacna1f gene to a region of the X
chromosome that shows homology of synteny to human chromosome Xp11.23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Incomplete Congenital Stationary Night Blindness, Type 2A

Conducting mutation analysis in 13 families with the incomplete form of
X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A; 300071), Strom
et al. (1998) identified 9 different mutations in 10 families, including
3 nonsense and 1 frameshift mutation. Similarly, by mutation analysis of
the CACNA1F gene in 20 families with incomplete CSNB, Bech-Hansen et al.
(1998) found 6 different mutations, all of which predicted premature
protein truncation.

Boycott et al. (2001) summarized 20 CACNA1F mutations that had been
identified in 36 families with incomplete X-linked congenital stationary
night blindness. Three of the mutations accounted for incomplete CSNB in
2 or more families, and a founder effect was demonstrable for one of
these mutations. Of the 20 mutations identified, 14 (70%) were predicted
to cause premature protein truncation and 6 (30%) to cause amino acid
substitutions or deletions at conserved positions in the alpha-1F
protein.

Wutz et al. (2002) reported comprehensive mutation analysis of the 48
exons of the CACNA1F gene in 34 unrelated cases (33 families and 1
sporadic case) diagnosed with the incomplete form of X-linked congenital
stationary night blindness, based on ERG data and dark adaptation tests.
Ten of the families had been partially characterized previously (Strom
et al., 1998). The patients were of German (32), Belgian (1), and French
(1) origin. Mutation analysis was also performed in 2 patients with an
Aland Island disease (300600)-related phenotype. A total of 30 different
mutations (20 of which were novel) were identified in 33 patients, 31
CSNB2 familial cases, and the 2 patients with an AIED-like phenotype.
Reevaluation of the AIED-like phenotype indicated full compatibility of
the patients' ophthalmologic findings with CSNB2. The mutations were
equally distributed over the entire gene sequence and included 13
missense, 8 nonsense, 5 splice site, 3 deletion, and 1 insertion
mutations. RT-PCR experiments in mouse strains with photoreceptor
degeneration showed that the Cacna1f gene is not exclusively expressed
in photoreceptors but in the outer nuclear, the inner nuclear, and the
ganglion cell layer as well.

Nakamura et al. (2003) described 2 Japanese brothers with retinal and
optic disc atrophy and progressive decrease of visual function with
increasing age. Although these clinical features are atypical of
patients with incomplete CSNB, both patients had an in-frame mutation
with deletion and insertion in exon 4 of the CACNA1F gene. In both
patients, the bright flash, mixed rod-cone ERG had a negative
configuration, characteristic of incomplete CSNB. However, the
full-field scotopic and photopic ERGs were nonrecordable, indicating
severe, diffuse retinal malfunction, not typical of incomplete CSNB.
These findings underscored the phenotypic variability of incomplete
CSNB.

Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) identified an ile745-to-thr mutation
(I745T; 300110.0006) in the CACNA1F gene in a New Zealand family with a
visual disorder more severe than typical CSNB2.

- Cone-Rod Dystrophy 3

In a large Finnish family with X-linked cone-rod dystrophy-3 (CORDX3;
300476), previously reported by Jalkanen et al. (2003), Jalkanen et al.
(2006) identified a splice site mutation in the CACNA1F gene
(300110.0007).

- Aland Island Eye Disease

In affected members of the original family with Aland Island eye disease
(300600) described by Forsius and Eriksson (1964), Jalkanen et al.
(2007) identified homozygosity for a 425-bp deletion mutation
encompassing exon 30 and portions of adjacent introns of the CACN1F gene
(300110.0008). The mutation was found in heterozygous state in carrier
females of this family and was not found in samples from 121 Finnish
male control subjects.

ANIMAL MODEL

Mansergh et al. (2005) generated a mouse with a loss-of-function
mutation in exon 7 of the mouse Cacna1f gene. Electroretinography of the
mutant mouse revealed a scotopic a-wave of marginally reduced amplitude
compared with the wildtype mouse and absence of the postreceptoral
b-wave and oscillatory potentials. Cone ERG responses together with
visual evoked potentials and multi-unit activity in the superior
colliculus were also absent. Calcium imaging of retinal slices
depolarized with KCl showed 90% less peak signal in the photoreceptor
synapses of the Cacna1f mutant than in wildtype mice. The absence of
postreceptoral ERG responses and the diminished photoreceptor calcium
signals were consistent with a loss of Ca(2+) channel function in
photoreceptors. Immunocytochemistry showed no detectable Cav1.4 protein
in the outer plexiform layer of Cacna1f-mutant mice, profound loss of
photoreceptor synapses, and abnormal dendritic sprouting of second-order
neurons in the photoreceptor layer. Mansergh et al. (2005) concluded
that the Cav1.4 calcium channel is vital for the functional assembly
and/or maintenance and synaptic functions of photoreceptor ribbon
synapses.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, GLY369ASP

One of the missense mutations identified by Strom et al. (1998) in cases
of incomplete X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A;
300071) was a gly369-to-asp (G369D) amino acid substitution resulting
from a transition of nucleotide 1106 in exon 8.

.0002
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, ARG958TER

One of the nonsense mutations identified in families with incomplete
X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2A; 300071) by Strom
et al. (1998) was an arg958-to-ter (R958X) mutation due to a C-to-T
transition of nucleotide 2172 in exon 24.

.0003
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, 1-BP INS, 991C

In 15 CSNB2A (300071) families with the common Mennonite haplotype,
suggesting that these families share a founder mutation (Boycott et al.
(1998)), Bech-Hansen et al. (1998) found insertion of a single C
nucleotide at codon 991 for leucine (L991insC). The insertion caused a
frameshift with stop codon 1001.

.0004
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, ARG830TER

Among families with CSNB2A (300071), one of the truncating mutations
found by Bech-Hansen et al. (1998) was a C-to-T transition in exon 21 of
the CACNA1F gene, resulting in an arg830-to-ter (R830X) nonsense amino
acid change.

.0005
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A
CACNA1F, 1-BP DEL, 4548C

In 2 affected members of a French family segregating X-linked congenital
stationary night blindness type 2, Jacobi et al. (2003) identified a
1-bp deletion (C) at nucleotide 4548 in the CACNA1F gene, resulting in a
frameshift with a predicted premature termination at codon 1524.

.0006
NIGHT BLINDNESS, CONGENITAL STATIONARY, TYPE 2A, SEVERE
CACNA1F, ILE745THR

Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) identified a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 2234 in exon 17 of the CACNA1F gene in a New Zealand family
with a retinal disorder similar to, but more severe than, X-linked
congenital stationary night blindness-2 (CSNB2A; 300071). The transition
resulted in the substitution of a conserved isoleucine with threonine at
residue 745 (I745T) within transmembrane segment IIS6. Affected males
had congenital nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, frequent
hypermetropia, and normal fundi. Female family members had congenital
nystagmus, decreased visual acuity, and frequent high myopia, in
contrast to typical CSNB2A families, in which female heterozygotes are
unaffected. Electroretinography showed CSNB2A-like features in males and
similar, but less severe, features in females. In addition, some
visually impaired males had intellectual impairment and were autistic.
Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) found that the I745T mutation caused
altered channel activity following expression in human embryonic kidney
cells. The channel showed a dramatic shift of about -30 mV in the
voltage dependence of activation and significantly slower inactivation
kinetics. Hemara-Wahanui et al. (2005) concluded that the I745T mutation
increases the number of mutant channels open at physiologic membrane
potential and allows for persistent Ca(2+) entry due to reduced channel
inactivation, resulting in a gain-of-function defect.

.0007
CONE-ROD DYSTROPHY, X-LINKED, 3
CACNA1F, 5-BP DEL/3-BP INS

In a large Finnish family with X-linked cone-rod dystrophy-3 (CORDX3;
300476), previously reported by Jalkanen et al. (2003), Jalkanen et al.
(2006) identified a deletion/insertion (IVS28-1 GCGTC-TGG) at -1
position in the splice acceptor site of intron 28 of the CACNA1F gene.
The mutation cosegregated completely with the disease phenotype in the
family, which included 7 affected males, 10 carrier females, and 33
unaffected family members; it was not found in 200 control chromosomes.
RNA studies revealed that the mutation caused altered splicing of the
CACNA1F transcript, resulting in 5 variants with predicted premature
termination and exonic deletions of the encoded protein.

.0008
ALAND ISLAND EYE DISEASE
CACNA1F, 425-BP DEL

In affected members of the original family with Aland Island eye disease
(300600) described by Forsius and Eriksson (1964), Jalkanen et al.
(2007) identified homozygosity for a 425-bp deletion mutation
encompassing exon 30 and portions of adjacent introns of the CACN1F
gene. The mutation was found in heterozygous state in carrier females of
this family and was not found in samples from 121 Finnish male control
subjects. The mutation is predicted to cause a deletion of the
transmembrane domain IVS2 and the preceding extracellular loop and
consequently an altered membrane topology for the C-terminal part of the
protein.

611668	TITLE *611668 CORONIN 7; CORO7
;;POLARITY-OSMOTIC DEFECTIVE 1, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF; POD1;;
CRN7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Coronins, such as CORO7, constitute an evolutionarily conserved family
of WD-repeat actin-binding proteins. CORO7 plays a role in Golgi complex
morphology and function (Rybakin et al., 2004, 2006).

CLONING

By EST database analysis, followed by RT-PCR of human liver carcinoma
cDNA, Rybakin et al. (2004) cloned CORO7, which they called CRN7. The
deduced 924-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 100.5
kD, which was confirmed experimentally. CORO7 contains 2 coronin WD
repeat-containing domains with a proline-, serine-, and
threonine-enriched region (PST motif) preceding the second WD-repeat.
CORO7 shares 30% and 29% amino acid identity with Drosophila Pod1 and C.
elegans Pod1, respectively. Northern blot analysis detected expression
in mouse embryos as early as day 5 postcoitum and expression increased
through day 15. Coro7 expression was detected in most mouse tissues
examined with high levels in brain, thymus, and kidney and low levels in
heart, liver, testis, and muscle. Western blot analysis of mouse tissues
showed a similar distribution of Coro7 with low expression in skeletal
and heart muscle. Immunofluorescence studies detected developmental
expression of mouse Coro7 in embryonic brain, thymus, intestine, skin,
and eye. Indirect immunofluorescence studies detected Coro7 in
vesicle-like structures and in a Golgi-like perinuclear compartment in
mouse fibroblasts. Sucrose gradient centrifugation and
immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that Coro7 localized to
cytosolic vesicles and to the cis-Golgi region. The membrane-associated
form of Coro7 was tyrosine-phosphorylated, whereas the cytosolic form
was not.

GENE FUNCTION

By electron microscopy, Rybakin et al. (2006) showed that siRNA
knockdown of CORO7 in HeLa cells caused loss of Golgi integrity and
membrane scattering. CORO7 knockdown caused a defect in Golgi export of
vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) but did not alter protein
import into the trans-Golgi network. Golgi cargo glycosylation was not
affected. Using in vitro binding, coimmunoprecipitation, and
colocalization studies, the authors demonstrated that CORO7 interacted
with clathrin adaptor AP1 (see 600157) and that this interaction takes
place at Golgi membranes. Rybakin et al. (2006) showed that CORO7 was
not required for AP1 targeting to Golgi membranes and suggested that
CORO7 acts downstream of AP1 recruitment.

604420	TITLE *604420 HEMATOPOIETICALLY EXPRESSED HOMEOBOX; HHEX
;;PRHX; PRH
DESCRIPTION Homeobox-containing genes are a large family of transcription factors
that are distinguished by a 60-amino acid evolutionarily conserved
DNA-binding homeodomain. See 142950 for additional background
information on homeobox genes.

CLONING

By PCR using oligonucleotide primers based on the chicken Prh sequence,
Crompton et al. (1992) isolated a partial human promyelocytic leukemia
cell line cDNA encoding HHEX (hematopoietically expressed homeobox),
which the authors termed Prh, for proline-rich homeobox. They isolated a
full-length HHEX cDNA by screening a human acute myelogenous leukemia
cell line cDNA library. HHEX encodes a 270-amino acid protein that shows
75% sequence identity with the chicken protein and 97% identity with it
in the homeodomain, where there are 2 consecutive proline residues.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of HHEX mRNA as a 1.7-kb
transcript in myeloid cell lines but not in lymphoid cell lines or
peripheral blood lymphocytes. Among nonhematopoietic cells, HHEX was
found in liver cells but not in fibroblasts, placenta, or HeLa cells.

Bedford et al. (1993) cloned an HHEX cDNA, which they termed HEX, from
human hematopoietic tissue by PCR using degenerate primers derived from
conserved regions of the homeodomain. The sequence of the HEX
homeodomain is 98% identical to that of the mouse and shows 55% homology
with that of human HOX11 (186770), another homeobox-containing
hematopoietic gene. The authors detected HEX as a 1.9-kb transcript in
normal human B cells and in most B-cell lines but not in normal T cells
or in most T-cell lines.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis, Hromas et al. (1993) mapped the HHEX
gene to chromosome 10, where the HOX11 gene is located. By FISH,
Morgutti et al. (2001) mapped the HHEX gene to chromosome 10q24.

GENE STRUCTURE

Morgutti et al. (2001) determined that the HHEX gene contains 4 exons
and spans 5.7 kb of genomic DNA.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanaka et al. (1999) found that rat HHEX functions as a transcriptional
repressor in liver cells and may be involved in the differentiation
and/or maintenance of the differentiated state in hepatocytes.

The divergent homeobox gene HEX is expressed in the anterior visceral
endoderm during early mouse development and in some adult tissues of
endodermal origin, including liver and thyroid. D'Elia et al. (2002)
analyzed HEX expression and subcellular localization in a series of 55
human thyroid tumors and in several tumor cell lines. HEX mRNA was
detected by RT-PCR either in normal tissues or in thyroid adenomas and
differentiated (papillary and follicular) carcinomas. HEX mRNA was also
expressed in most undifferentiated carcinomas. In normal tissues and
adenomas, HEX protein was present both in nucleus and cytoplasm. In
contrast, both differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas, as well
as the tumor cell lines investigated, showed HEX protein only in the
cytoplasm. These findings suggested that regulation of HEX entry in the
nucleus of thyrocytes may represent a critical step during human thyroid
tumorigenesis.

Donaldson et al. (2005) developed computational tools for the
identification of gene regulatory sequences functionally related to the
stem cell enhancer, SCL (TAL1; 187040). Two candidate enhancers
discovered in this way were located in intron 1 of the FLI1 (193067) and
HHEX genes, both transcription factors previously implicated in
controlling blood and endothelial development. Transgenic and
biochemical analyses demonstrated that the 2 enhancers are functionally
related to the SCL stem cell enhancer.

Foley and Mercola (2005) presented evidence suggesting that HHEX has a
role in fetal cardiac development.

Using binding studies and reporter gene assays, Oram et al. (2010) found
that ERG (165080) and FLI1 bound and activated the intermediate promoter
of the LMO2 gene (180385) in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
samples. LMO2 also bound enhancers in the FLI1 and ERG loci, and all 3
proteins bound an enhancer element in the first intron of the
hematopoietically expressed HHEX gene and upregulated expression of an
HHEX reporter gene. Oram et al. (2010) proposed that a self-sustaining
triad of LMO2, ERG, and FLI1 are involved in T-ALL by stabilizing HHEX
expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

For discussion of an association between variation in the HHEX gene and
type 2 diabetes, see 125853.

ANIMAL MODEL

Paz et al. (2010) stated that Hhex knockout in mice is embryonic lethal,
with impaired forebrain, liver, and thyroid development. Using a mouse
embryonic stem (ES) cell coculture system, in which ES cells could
differentiate into Cd41 (see 607759)-positive and Cd45 (PTPRC;
151460)-positive hematopoietic progenitors in vitro, Paz et al. (2010)
found that Hhex -/- ES cells accumulated as Cd41-positive and
Cd41-positive/Kit (164920)-positive hematopoietic progenitors with
reduced ability to develop into mature Cd45-positive hematopoietic
cells. These Cd41-positive/Kit-positive progenitors showed reduced
proliferation due to accumulation at the G2 phase of the cell cycle.
Loss of Hhex expression lead to delayed hemangioblast development and
reduced capacity to form mature Cd45-positive progenitor cells. Those
Hhex -/- ES cells able to mature into Cd45-positive cells were able to
differentiate into more committed B and myeloid lineages.

602074	TITLE *602074 DEATH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 3; DAP3
;;MITOCHONDRIAL RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN S29; MRPS29
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Kissil et al. (1995) cloned DAP3. DAP3 is transcribed into a 1.7-kb mRNA
and encodes a 46-kD protein carrying a potential nucleotide-binding
motif.

By proteolytic digestion of whole bovine 28S subunits, followed by
peptide analysis and EST database analysis, Koc et al. (2001) identified
full-length human DAP3, which they called MRPS29. The deduced 397-amino
acid MRPS29 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 45.6 kD. Removal
of a predicted 16-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial localization
signal results in a mature 43.6-kD protein. Koc et al. (2001) identified
MRPS29 orthologs in mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast, but not in
E. coli. Mouse and human MRPS29 share 81.8% amino acid identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Kissil et al. (1995) found that DAP3 was involved in mediating
interferon-gamma (147570)-induced cell death. Several lines of evidence
suggested that suppression of cell death is a critical step in the
multistage process of tumorigenesis. Kissil et al. (1995) concluded that
DAP3, being a positive mediator of cell death, may be a tumor suppressor
gene subject to loss or inactivation in tumors.

MAPPING

Kissil and Kimchi (1997) mapped the DAP3 gene to chromosome 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Verification of the assignment was
achieved by identifying the gene in a YAC contig encompassing chromosome
1q21.1-q21.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hirota et al. (2004) found a strong association between bronchial asthma
(600807) in adults and SNPs in the DAP3 gene (p = 0.0051; OR = 1.87; 95%
CI = 1.20-2.92), but no association with childhood asthma. The tendency
was more prominent in patients with high serum total immunoglobulin E
(IgE; 147180). DAP3 was found to be expressed in normal bronchial
epithelial cells, and that expression was induced by IFNG.

603647	TITLE *603647 BCS1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE; BCS1L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The human BCS1L gene encodes a homolog of S. cerevisiae bcs1 protein
involved in the assembly of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory
chain.

CLONING

The S. cerevisiae bcs1 protein is a constituent of the inner
mitochondrial membrane and is required for the expression of functional
ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (bc1) complex (see 191328). The bcs1
protein shares sequence similarity with members of the AAA (ATPases
associated with various cellular activities) superfamily (see 601681).
By searching an EST database for sequences related to bcs1, Petruzzella
et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding human BCS1L (BCS1-like). The
predicted 420-amino acid human protein is 50% identical to yeast bcs1
and, like bcs1, contains 2 conserved nucleotide-binding motifs. Although
BCS1L does not contain an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence,
in vitro mitochondrial import and trypsin-protection assays demonstrated
that it is imported into mitochondria. Northern blot analysis revealed
that BCS1L is expressed ubiquitously as a 1.4-kb mRNA. The authors also
detected a 4.5-kb transcript that they considered to be either an
alternative BCS1L mRNA or an mRNA derived from a related gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Found within the inner mitochondrial membrane, BCS1L is presumed to
facilitate insertion of Rieske Fe/S protein into precursors to complex
III during assembly of the respiratory chain (Cruciat et al., 1999).
Complex III then becomes assembled with complexes IV and I into a
respirasome supercomplex that facilitates the electron transfer required
for the synthesis of ATP.

MAPPING

Based on sequence similarity to ESTs, Petruzzella et al. (1998)
tentatively mapped the BCS1L gene to 2q33.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Lonlay et al. (2001) showed that the BCS1L gene consists of 7 exons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mitochondrial Complex III Deficiency, Nuclear Type 1

De Lonlay et al. (2001) found 4 biallelic mutations in the BCS1L gene in
6 patients from 4 families with mitochondrial complex III deficiency
nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1; 124000) characterized by neonatal proximal
tubulopathy, hepatic involvement, and encephalopathy. Complementation
studies in yeast confirmed the deleterious effect of these missense
mutations. De Lonlay et al. (2001) suggested that mutation of BCS1L is a
frequent cause of complex III deficiency, as one-third of their Turkish
patients had mutations in the BSC1L gene. De Lonlay et al. (2001)
reported that they had not been able to detect BCS1L mutations in
complex III-deficient patients with clinical presentations other than
neonatal tubulopathy with hepatic involvement and encephalopathy.

- GRACILE Syndrome

The GRACILE (growth retardation, amino aciduria, cholestasis, iron
overload, lactic acidosis, and early death) syndrome (603358) belongs to
the disease heritage of Finland. All affected families carry the same
ancestral haplotype on 2q33-q37, indicating 1 founder mutation (Visapaa
et al., 1998). Visapaa et al. (2002) identified a homozygous
ser78-to-gly mutation (S78G; 603358.0005) in the BCS1L gene in all
Finnish patients with GRACILE syndrome studied. In addition, they
identified 5 different mutations in the BCS1L gene in 3 British infants,
previously reported by Morris et al. (1995), whose symptoms resembled
those in GRACILE syndrome but who also had complex III deficiency and
neurologic symptoms. The phenotype of the Turkish patients in whom de
Lonlay et al. (2001) demonstrated mutations in the BCS1L gene was
distinctly different from that of the Finnish patients. Whereas the
Turkish patients had complex III deficiency, the Finnish patients had
complex III activity within the normal range. The Finnish patients had
no neurologic problems, but had marked hepatic iron overload, associated
with abnormal levels of proteins involved in iron transfer and storage,
and free plasma iron. These findings implied that BCS1L has another
cellular function that is uncharacterized but essential, and that it is
putatively involved in iron metabolism.

- Bjornstad Syndrome

Bjornstad syndrome (262000) is an autosomal recessive condition
characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and pili torti. Lubianca
Neto et al. (1998) mapped the Bjornstad syndrome locus to 2q34-q36.
Hinson et al. (2007) refined the map location of the disorder to 2q35
and demonstrated mutations in the BCS1L gene (e.g., 603647.0001).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

To understand how BCS2L mutations cause such widely different clinical
phenotypes, Hinson et al. (2007) considered the locations of defects on
the BCS1L protein structure and compared the function of mutant BCS1L in
yeast and in human lymphocytes. Their studies showed that all BCS1L
mutations disrupted the assembly of mitochondrial respirasomes (the
basic unit of respiration in human mitochondria), but the clinical
severity of the mutations was correlated with the production of reactive
oxygen species. The data indicated that in addition to mitochondrial
heteroplasmy and variable energy requirements of tissues,
tissue-specific sensitivities to reactive oxygen species contribute to
the variability of the manifestations of mitochondrial defects.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, SER277ASN

In 2 affected sibs and 1 fetus in a consanguineous family with
mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1; 124000)
characterized by neonatal tubulopathy, encephalopathy, and liver
failure, de Lonlay et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 830G-A
transition in the BCS1L gene, resulting in a ser277-to-asp (S277N)
substitution.

.0002
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY
BCS1L, PRO99LEU

In 2 patients with complex III deficiency (124000), a boy and a girl,
born to unrelated consanguineous families, de Lonlay et al. (2001)
identified the same homozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 296 in
exon 1 of the BCS1L gene, causing the substitution of a leucine for a
highly conserved proline at codon 99 (P99L). The patients had metabolic
acidosis, hepatic involvement, neurologic deterioration, and brainstem
and basal ganglia lesions consistent with a diagnosis of Leigh syndrome
(256000). One patient had abnormal ventilation patterns and proximal
renal tubulopathy.

.0003
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, ARG155PRO

In a boy of Turkish origin with complex III deficiency (124000) born to
nonconsanguineous parents, de Lonlay et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the BCS1L gene: a 464C-G transversion
in exon 3 of the BCS1L gene, resulting in an arg155-to-pro (R155P)
substitution, and a 1057G-A transition in exon 7, resulting in a
val353-to-met (V353M; 603647.0004) substitution.

.0005
GRACILE SYNDROME
BCS1L, SER78GLY

Visapaa et al. (2002) reported that all GRACILE syndrome (603358)
patients in Finland were homozygous for a 232A-G mutation in exon 2 of
the BCS1L gene, resulting in a ser78-to-gly (S78G) substitution. Unlike
the Turkish patients reported by de Lonlay et al. (2001), the Finnish
patients had normal complex III activity and no neurologic problems, but
did have marked iron overload.

.0006
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, ARG45CYS

In 2 Spanish sibs with fatal infantile complex III deficiency (124000),
De Meirleir et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for
mutation in the BCS1L gene: a 246C-T transition in exon 1, resulting in
an arg45-to-cys (R45C) substitution, and a 279C-T transition in exon 1,
resulting in an arg56-to-ter (R56X; 603647.0007) substitution. The R45C
substitution occurs in a crucial targeting signal of the gene and is
predicted to interfere with proper protein functioning. Each parent was
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. Both patients had severe metabolic
acidosis noted shortly after birth, as well as severe liver dysfunction
and a renal tubulopathy. One died at age 3 weeks of lactic acidosis. The
second infant also had obvious neurologic involvement, with delayed
myelination, axial hypotonia, and developmental delay. He died at age 3
months. Postmortem liver examination of both infants showed liver
fibrosis, severe cholestasis, and hepatosiderosis with accumulation of
iron in aggregates of macrophages and in Kupffer cells. Mitochondria
appeared enlarged with few or no cristae and a fluffy matrix. De
Meirleir et al. (2003) suggested that the iron accumulation could be
explained by the lack of incorporation of iron in the iron-sulfur
cluster of complex III.

Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) reported another Spanish infant with the R45C
and R56X mutations. She presented with neonatal severe hypotonia, food
intolerance, and vomiting. She soon developed a proximal renal
tubulopathy with glucosuria, phosphaturia, and aminoaciduria, metabolic
lactic acidosis, and hepatic involvement. Bilateral cataracts were also
noted. At age 4 months, she showed nystagmus, hypertonia, microcephaly,
developmental delay, and failure to thrive. Her neurologic condition and
metabolic acidosis worsened rapidly, and she died at 6 months of age.
Biochemical studies of muscle tissue showed impaired activity of
mitochondrial complex III. Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) noted that this
child did not have evidence of altered iron metabolism, as had been
observed in the patients reported by De Meirleir et al. (2003), and as
has been observed in patients with the allelic disorder GRACILE syndrome
(603358). Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) postulated that phenotypic
variability even in individuals with the same BCS1L genotype may reflect
tissue-specific expression of the mutant gene.

BJORNSTAD SYNDROME
BCS1L, ARG183HIS

In affected members of the family with Bjornstad syndrome (262000) in
which Lubianca Neto et al. (1998) demonstrated linkage to 2q, Hinson et
al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition in the BCS1L
gene, resulting in an arg183-to-his (R183H) substitution. Eight
individuals in 2 sibships related as first cousins once removed were
affected; the parents in each case were consanguineous.

.0009
BJORNSTAD SYNDROME WITH MILD MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1, INCLUDED
BCS1L, ARG184CYS

In a sporadic case of Bjornstad syndrome (262000) with mild
mitochondrial complex III deficiency (124000), Hinson et al. (2007)
found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the BCS1L
gene: arg184 to cys (R184C) and gly35 to arg (G35R; 603647.0010).

In a Moroccan girl with mitochondrial complex III deficiency (124000),
Fernandez-Vizarra et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for
the R184C mutation and a 547C-T transition in exon 3 of the BCS1L gene,
resulting in an arg183-to-cys (R183C; 603647.0012) substitution. She
presented at age 9 months with acute psychomotor regression, hypotonia,
and failure to thrive, which progressed to spastic quadriparesis and
mental retardation associated with abnormal signal intensities in the
thalami, basal ganglia, and periventricular white matter, consistent
with an encephalopathy. Heart, liver, and kidneys were apparently
unaffected, but she was also noted to have brittle hair. Studies in
yeast showed that both mutations significantly reduced mitochondrial
cytochrome content and respiratory activity, as well as caused a
decreased incorporation of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (UQCRFS1;
191327) into complex III. Further studies showed decreased levels of
fully assembled complex III. The findings suggested that BCS1L is
necessary for proper complex III assembly.

MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, THR50ALA

In a 4-year-old Spanish boy with isolated mitochondrial complex III
deficiency (124000), Blazquez et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
148A-G transition in exon 1 of the BCS1L gene, resulting in a
thr50-to-ala (T50A) substitution in the mitochondrial sorting sequence.
He presented at 6 months of age with psychomotor retardation, failure to
thrive, hypotonia, lactic acidosis, and hepatic dysfunction. Physical
examination showed unstable head support, poor eye fixation, coarse
facies, and epicanthus. There was hypertrichosis of the frontal head
zone and limbs, and excessive fat distribution in the upper back, neck,
hands and feet, with almost no fat on the limbs. Respiratory chain
activity in muscle and fibroblasts showed an isolated complex III defect
(58% of normal in muscle, 93% in fibroblasts). At age 4 years, he still
showed psychomotor retardation, had developed mild sensorineural hearing
loss, and persistent lactic acidemia, but renal function, hair, and iron
metabolism were normal. Brain MRI was normal. The mutation was not found
in 400 control alleles, and each unaffected parent was heterozygous for
the mutation.

604471	TITLE *604471 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 1 (GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 7; SLC1A7
;;EXCITATORY AMINO ACID TRANSPORTER 5; EAAT5;;
GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER, RETINA
DESCRIPTION The uptake of glutamate and other excitatory amino acids is mediated by
a family of high-affinity sodium-dependent transporters, the excitatory
amino acid transporters (EAATs). The transport of glutamate is driven by
the cotransport of sodium ions and the countertransport of potassium
ions down their electrochemical gradients, and studies have suggested
that this complex process involves the cotransport of protons as well.
In addition to these transport currents, an uncoupled passive flux of
chloride ions has been detected. The relative magnitude of this
associated chloride conductance varies with each transporter subtype. A
glutamate-dependent current that has a transporter-like pharmacology is
carried largely by chloride ions in retinal cone and rod photoreceptors
and bipolar cells. By screening a human retina cDNA library with a
salamander retina cDNA encoding a glutamate transporter associated with
a large chloride conductance, Arriza et al. (1997) identified SLC1A7,
which they called EAAT5. They isolated an EAAT5 cDNA encoding a deduced
560-amino acid protein containing 8 putative transmembrane domains and a
single potential N-linked glycosylation site in the putative large
extracellular loop. Although EAAT5 shares the structural homologies of
the EAAT family, 1 novel feature of the EAAT5 sequence is a C-terminal
motif previously identified in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and
potassium channels and shown to confer interactions with a family of
synaptic proteins that promote ion channel clustering. EAAT5 has 46%
amino acid sequence identity with EAAT1 (SLC1A3; 600111), 43% identity
with EAAT4 (SLC1A6; 600637), 37% identity with EAAT3 (SLC1A1; 133550),
and 36% identity with EAAT2 (SLC1A2; 600300). Arriza et al. (1997)
measured the functional properties of EAAT5 in a Xenopus oocyte
expression system by measuring radiolabeled glutamate flux and
2-electrode voltage clamp recording. EAAT5-mediated L-glutamate uptake
was sodium- and voltage-dependent and chloride-independent. Transporter
currents elicited by glutamate were also sodium- and voltage-dependent,
but ion substitution experiments suggested that this current was largely
carried by chloride ions. Northern blot analysis of 8 human tissues
detected a major 3.1-kb EAAT5 transcript that was abundantly expressed
only in retina. Arriza et al. (1997) concluded that the properties of
EAAT5 are similar to the glutamate-elicited chloride conductances
described in retinal neurons, suggesting that the EAAT5-associated
chloride conductance may participate in visual processing.

;;ATF7-INTERACTING PROTEIN;;
ATFA MODULATOR, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; AM;;
MBD1-CONTAINING CHROMATIN-ASSOCIATED FACTOR; MCAF;;
MCAF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ATF7IP is a multifunctional nuclear protein that associates with
heterochromatin. It can act as a transcriptional coactivator or
corepressor depending upon its binding partners (summary by Liu et al.,
2009).

CLONING

Using mass spectroscopy to identify HeLa cell proteins that copurified
with SETDB1 (604396), followed by EST database and genomic sequence
analyses, Wang et al. (2003) cloned full-length ATF7IP, which they
called AM. The deduced 1,270-amino acid human protein shares 78%
identity with mouse Am, an Atfa (ATF7; 606371)-associated factor. Human
AM had an apparent molecular mass of 200 kD by SDS-PAGE.

Using the transcriptional repressor domain of MBD1 (156535) as bait in a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Fujita et al. (2003)
cloned ATF7IP, which they called MCAF. The deduced 1,270-amino acid
protein contains 2 conserved domains in its C-terminal half. Western
blot analysis detected endogenous MCAF at an apparent molecular mass of
about 200 kD in several human cell lines. MCAF and MBD1 colocalized in
multiple foci in HeLa cell interphase nuclei.

Uchimura et al. (2006) identified a highly conserved SUMO (see SUMO1;
601912)-interacting motif between the 2 C-terminal domains of human
MCAF1.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2003) showed that recombinant mouse Am increased the
methyltransferase activity of recombinant mouse Setdb1 against histone
H3 (see 602810) lys9 (H3K9). The methyltransferase activity of the
recombinant Am-Setdb1 complex was comparable to that of the endogenous
AM-SETDB1 complex purified from HeLa cells. Am increased the turnover
rate of the reaction by increasing Vmax and decreasing Km. In the
absence of Am, the predominant Setdb1 product was dimethylated H3K9, and
in the presence of Am, the predominant Setdb1 product was trimethylated
H3K9. These results were confirmed by small interfering RNA-mediated
knockdown of AM in HEK293 cells and HeLa cells. Use of a reconstituted
chromatin transcription system revealed that Am also enhanced the
transcriptional repression activity of Setdb1.

Using reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down
assays, Fujita et al. (2003) confirmed a direct interaction between MCAF
and MBD1. Deletion analysis revealed that the C-terminal transcriptional
repressor domain (TRD) of MBD1 interacted with the most C-terminal
conserved domain of MCAF. Reporter gene assays showed that MCAF enhanced
SP1 (189906)-mediated transcription of several SP1-responsive promoters.
However, MCAF also increased the repressive function of the isolated TRD
of MBD1 against SP1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed
that MBD1 linked MCAF to methylated promoters. MCAF also associated with
unmethylated promoters regardless of the presence of MBD1.

Ichimura et al. (2005) showed that both MCAF1 and MCAF2 (ATF7IP2;
613645) bound to the C-terminal TRD of MBD1, as well as to SETDB1 and
SP1. Immunoprecipitation analysis of K562 human erythroleukemia cells
revealed that MCAF1 showed higher affinity for SETDB1 than SP1, whereas
MCAF2 showed higher affinity for SP1 than SETDB1. Both MCAF proteins
were also detected in the same immunoprecipitates. Both MCAF1 and MCAF2
increased transcription of a reporter gene activated by SP1, and the TRD
of MBD1 moderately repressed transcription in the presence of either
MCAF1 or MCAF2. The combination of MCAF1, the TRD of MBD1, and SETDB1
caused marked transcriptional repression in a SETDB1-dependent manner.
In contrast, SETDB1 had no effect on promoter activity in the presence
of MCAF2 and the TRD of MBD1. Knockdown of MCAF1 in HeLa cells abolished
repression by the TRD of MBD1, and exogenous expression of MCAF2 partly
compensated for MCAF1 knockdown.

Uchimura et al. (2006) found that MBD1 was multiply sumoylated in HeLa
cells and that sumoylation of MBD1 increased its interaction with MCAF1.
MCAF1 itself was not a target for sumoylation. MCAF1 and endogenous
SUMO1 or SUMO2 (603042)/SUMO3 (602231) partly colocalized at nuclear
foci in C-33A human cervical carcinoma cells. Knockdown of SUMO1 or
SUMO2/SUMO3 disrupted the association of MCAF1 with MBD1. SUMO knockdown
also disrupted the association of MBD1 with several factors required for
heterochromatin assembly, including HP1-beta (CBX1; 604511). Ectopic
expression of the SUMO-binding fragment of MCAF1 caused delocalization
of MCAF1 and HP1-beta, possibly by sequestration of free SUMO proteins.

Using protein pull-down assays and deletion analysis, Liu et al. (2009)
found that the 2 conserved domains of MCAF1 interacted directly with
overlapping C-terminal domains in SP1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis of HeLa cells revealed that both MCAF1 and SP1 associated with
the TERT (187270) and TERC (602322) promoter regions. Small interfering
RNA-mediated knockdown studies showed that MCAF1 interacted with the
TERT promoter in an SP1-dependent manner. Knockdown of either MCAF1 or
SP1 downregulated expression of TERT by reducing association of
phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (see 180660) and ERCC3 (133510) at the
TERT promoter and compromised telomere maintenance. Immunoprecipitation
analysis revealed that MCAF1 was contained in a general transcriptional
complex along with TFIIE-alpha (GTF2E1; 189962), TFIIE-beta (GTF2E2;
189964), ERCC2 (126340), and ERCC3. Protein pull-down assays and domain
analysis revealed that each of these proteins bound 1 or both conserved
domains of MCAF1.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the ATF7IP gene to chromosome 12p13.1 based on an
alignment of the ATF7IP gene (GenBank GENBANK AK001550) with the genomic
sequence (GRCh37).

608003	TITLE *608003 HOMEODOMAIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 1; HIPK1
;;KIAA0630
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) obtained a partial HIPK1 cDNA clone,
which they designated KIAA0630. Over 295 amino acids, the deduced
sequence shares 32.2% identity with a serine/threonine protein kinase.
RT-PCR detected expression in all tissues examined.

Ecsedy et al. (2003) cloned mouse Hipk1. Northern blot analysis detected
expression in all mouse and human tissues examined. RNA dot-blot
analysis of human tissues detected expression in all adult and fetal
tissues. Immunolocalization of Hipk1 in mouse fibroblasts detected
punctate nuclear staining. Hipk1 also localized throughout the nucleus
and was excluded only from nucleoli. In addition, there was a diffuse
cytoplasmic staining.

Using p53 (191170) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Kondo et al.
(2003) cloned rat Hipk1, and using the rat cDNA as probe, they cloned
human HIPK1 from a skeletal muscle cDNA library. The deduced 1,210-amino
acid protein contains a putative serine/threonine kinase domain.
Northern blot analysis detected expression of a 9-kb transcript in
heart, brain, placenta, skeletal muscle, and pancreas.

GENE FUNCTION

Ecsedy et al. (2003) found that HIPK1, but not a kinase-dead mutant
(lys219 to ala), underwent autophosphorylation and was able to
phosphorylate substrate proteins in vitro. Endogenous HIPK1
immunoprecipitated with DAXX (603186) from human embryonic kidney cells
and phosphorylated DAXX in vitro and in vivo. HIPK1 phosphorylated DAXX
on ser669, and phosphorylation diminished DAXX transcriptional
repression in 3 of 4 reporters assayed. In human embryonic kidney cells,
interaction with HIPK1 resulted in the relocalization of DAXX from
promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML; 102578) oncogenic domains (PODs).
The relocalization required the HIPK1 kinase domain, but it was
independent of DAXX phosphorylation.

Kondo et al. (2003) confirmed interaction between HIPK1 and p53 by
immunoprecipitation assays. Deletion analysis showed that amino acids
100 to 370 of p53 and 885 to 1093 of HIPK1 were sufficient for the
interaction. HIPK1 serine phosphorylated p53 and was able to
autophosphorylate. Kondo et al. (2003) found HIPK1 expression elevated
in 12 of 14 breast cancer cell lines. In 2 of these cell lines, HIPK1
was expressed at more than 10 times the control levels. Oncogenically
transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts developed from Hipk1-null mice
showed reduced transcription of Mdm2 (164785) and were more susceptible
to apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Carcinogen-treated Hipk1-null mice
developed fewer and smaller skin tumors than wildtype mice.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the HIPK1
gene to chromosome 1. By in situ hybridization, Kondo et al. (2003)
mapped the HIPK1 gene to chromosome 1p13.

;;HERPESVIRUS ENTRY MEDIATOR C; HVEC;;
POLIOVIRUS RECEPTOR-RELATED 1; PVRR1;;
PVRR; PRR;;
NECTIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PVRL1, or nectin-1, belongs to the nectin subfamily of
immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules that participate in
Ca(2+)-independent cell-cell adhesion. Nectins bind to the actin
cytoskeleton through the adaptor protein afadin (MLLT4; 159559) and are
key components of adherens junctions (summary by Barron et al. (2008)).

CLONING

Members of the immunoglobin (Ig) superfamily have been shown to serve as
receptors for various viruses. The human poliovirus receptor (PVR;
173850) is an integral membrane protein with one V-like extracellular Ig
domain, 2 C-like extracellular Ig domains, a transmembrane region, and
an intracytoplasmic region. Lopez et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA for a
poliovirus receptor related gene, which they symbolized PRR. The
predicted protein is 518 amino acids long and has a domain structure
similar to PVR. In the extracellular domain, PRR is nearly 52% identical
to PVR and 54% identical to the murine homolog of PVR. Northern blots
showed a major 5.9-kb mRNA in all tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the Don Chinese hamster line, Carritt and Goldfarb (1976) found
that susceptibility to herpesvirus is determined by a gene on chromosome
3. Francke and Francke (1979) used a V79 line and concluded that human
chromosome 11 is responsible for susceptibility; Don and V79 did not
complement.

Geraghty et al. (1998) showed that poliovirus receptor-related protein-1
mediated entry of several alphaherpesviruses, including herpes simplex
viruses (HSV) 1 and 2, porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV), and bovine
herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) into cells. The poliovirus receptor itself
mediated entry of PRV and BHV-1, but not of the HSV strains tested by
Geraghty et al. (1998). They found that PVRR1 was expressed in human
cells of epithelial and neuronal origin and concluded that it is a prime
candidate for the coreceptor that allows both HSV-1 and HSV-2 to infect
epithelial cells on mucosal surfaces and spread to cells of the nervous
system.

Using immunolocalization of adult mouse hippocampal sections Mizoguchi
et al. (2002) found that the nectin-afadin system colocalizes with the
cadherin (see 192090)-catenin (see 116805) system at synapses between
mossy fiber terminals and dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA3 area.
Nectins-1 and -3 (PVRL3; 607147) asymmetrically localize at the pre- and
postsynaptic sides of puncta adherentia junctions, respectively. During
development, nectins-1 and -3 asymmetrically localize not only at puncta
adherentia junctions but also at synaptic junctions. Using rat
hippocampal neurons in culture, Mizoguchi et al. (2002) observed that
inhibition of the nectin-based adhesion results in a decrease in synapse
size and a concomitant increase in synapse number.

Togashi et al. (2011) found that mouse hair cells and supporting cells
express the immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules nectin-1 and -3,
respectively, and that their interaction mediates the heterotypic
adhesion between these 2 cell types. Genetic removal of nectin-1 or -3
disrupted the checkerboard-like pattern, inducing aberrant attachment
between hair cells. When cells expressing either nectin-1 or -3 were
cocultured, they arranged themselves into a mosaic pattern. Thus,
Togashi et al. (2011) concluded that nectin-1 and nectin-3 promote the
formation of the checkerboard-like pattern of the auditory epithelia.

MAPPING

Lopez et al. (1995) mapped the PVRR gene to 11q23-q24 by in situ
hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia syndrome (CLPED1; 225060),
which has been called both Zlotogora-Ogur syndrome and Margarita Island
ectodermal dysplasia, is characterized clinically by cleft lip/palate,
hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, developmental defects of the hands, and,
in some cases, mental retardation. Although generally rare, CLPED1
occurs with a frequency of approximately 1 per 2,000 among the
indigenous population of Margarita Island, in whom Suzuki et al. (1998)
assigned the CLPED1 locus to 11q23 by linkage mapping. Suzuki et al.
(2000) genotyped markers spanning the CLPED1 interval in an inbred
Israeli family with a diagnosis of Zlotogora-Ogur syndrome. The proband
was homozygous and the first-cousin parents heterozygous for all markers
tested, but with a different disease-associated haplotype than in
Margarita Island families, consistent with allelism between Margarita
Island and Israeli CLPED1. Suzuki et al. (2000) followed a positional
cloning approach to identify the CLPED1 gene as PVRL1, encoding
nectin-1, an immunoglobulin-related transmembrane cell-cell adhesion
molecule that is part of the NAP cell adhesion system. Nectin-1 is also
the principal cell surface receptor for alpha-herpesviruses (Geraghty et
al., 1998). Suzuki et al. (2000) speculated that the high frequency of
CLPED1 on Margarita Island in the Caribbean Sea might have resulted from
resistance of heterozygotes to infection by these viruses.

In Margarita Island CLPED1 patients, Suzuki et al. (2000) identified a
nonsense mutation (W185X; 600644.0001) in the PVRL1 gene.

Sozen et al. (2001) demonstrated a highly significant association
between heterozygosity for the W185X mutation and sporadic, nonsyndromic
cleft lip with or without cleft palate (see 225060) in northern
Venezuela.

ANIMAL MODEL

Barron et al. (2008) found that nectin-1 -/- mice were viable and
fertile, but manifested microphthalmia and defective amelogenesis of
their incisor teeth. Nectin-1 -/- incisors lacked the normal iron
pigmentation characteristic of rodent enamel and were prone to wear and
breakage. Immunohistochemical analysis of wildtype mice showed nectin-1
staining at the interface between the maturation-stage ameloblasts and
the underlying cells of the stratum intermedium. In the absence of
nectin-1, these cell layers were separated. Numerous large desmosomes
were present at this interface in wildtype mice; however, where adhesion
persisted in nectin-1 -/- mice, the desmosomes were smaller and less
numerous. Barron et al. (2008) concluded that nectin-1 participates in
desmosome assembly.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CLEFT LIP/PALATE-ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME

PVRL1, TRP185TER

In Margarita Island CLPED1 patients (225060), Suzuki et al. (2000)
identified a nonsense mutation of codon trp185 (TGG to TAG) in the PVRL1
gene.

Sozen et al. (2001) demonstrated a highly significant association
between heterozygosity for the W185X mutation and nonsyndromic, sporadic
cleft lip with or without cleft palate (see 119530) in northern
Venezuela. In the Cumana region of northern Venezuela, 14 (5.8%) of 243
individuals with cleft lip with or without cleft palate carried this
mutation, versus 1 of 245 controls (0.4%) (p = 0.00039).

.0002
CLEFT LIP/PALATE-ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
PVRL1, 1-BP DEL

In an Israeli family with cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia (225060)
reported by Zlotogora et al. (1987), Suzuki et al. (2000) identified
deletion of 1 guanine from codon 185 (trp) of the PVRL1 gene, converting
TGG to T-G and resulting in a frameshift. Notably this involved the same
codon as was involved in a nonsense mutation in the Margarita Island
CLEPD1 patients (600644.0001).

.0003
CLEFT LIP/PALATE-ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
PVRL1, 1-BP DUP

In a Brazilian family with CLEPD1 (225060), Suzuki et al. (2000)
identified a single-base duplication in codon gly323 of the PVRL1 gene
(GGT to GGTT), resulting in frameshift.

615178	TITLE *615178 KXDL MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1; KXD1
;;CHROMOSOME 19 OPEN READING FRAME 50; C19ORF50
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Based on experiments in mice and Drosophila, KXD1 is predicted to have a
role in biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (Yang et al., 2012).

CLONING

By database analysis, Yang et al. (2012) identified human KXD1 and 2
splice variants of mouse Kxd1, which they termed Kxd1a and Kxd1b. The
deduced 177-amino acid mouse Kxd1a protein has a calculated molecular
mass of 20 kD and shares 93% amino acid identity with human KXD1. Kxd1a
is predicted to have 2 coiled-coil regions, the second of which contains
the KxDL motif. Kxd1b encodes a deduced 219-amino acid protein with an
N-terminal extension compared with Kxd1a. Western blot analysis detected
a single Kxdl1 protein that was expressed at variable levels in all
mouse tissues examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using protein interaction assays, Yang et al. (2012) showed that mouse
Kxd1 interacted with BLOS1 (BLOC1S1; 601444) and all other subunits of
biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC1) examined.
Knockdown of BLOS1 in HeLa cells via small interfering RNA reduced KXD1
protein content.

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the KXD1 gene to chromosome 19p13.11 based on an
alignment of the KXD1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK098346) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Yang et al. (2012) found that Kxd1 -/- mice had a mild phenotype that
included reduction in dense granule content in platelets and
malformation of melanosomes in retinal pigment epithelia. The retinal
defect was associated with significantly reduced eumelanin content.
Knockout of Kxd1 reduced the steady-state level of Blos1, whereas the
levels of the BLOC1 subunits dysbindin (DTNBP1; 607145) and pallidin
(BLOC1S6; 604310) were unaffected. Likewise, Kxd1 content was not

EGG-DERIVED TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF;;
HJUMPY
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MTMR14 gene encodes a muscle-specific inositide phosphatase that
acts specifically on phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2),
and possibly other targets, and plays a critical role in skeletal muscle
calcium homeostasis and likely other cellular processes (summary by
Romero-Suarez et al., 2010).

CLONING

From a database screen for protein sequences similar to human
myotubularin (300415), which is mutated in a form of centronuclear
myopathy (CNMX; 310400), Tosch et al. (2006) identified a novel protein,
MTMR14, with high homology to Drosophila egg-derived tyrosine
phosphatase (EDTP). The authors called this protein hJUMPY because
disruption of EDTP protein function in Drosophila causes a phenotype
termed JUMPY: a muscle defect and a progressive loss of muscle control
together with shaky and slower movements. The deduced 650-amino acid
MTMR14 protein contains a predicted protein tyrosine phosphatase and
dual-specificity phosphatase (PTP/DSP) domain and the canonical C(X)5R
consensus present in active PTP/DSPs. The MTMR14 catalytic loop shows
closest resemblance to that of active myotubularins. Northern blot
analysis detected a 2.5-kb MTMR14 transcript with highest expression in
skeletal muscle and heart and lower expression in placenta, kidney,
liver, pancreas, and lung. Immunofluorescence studies showed that MTMR14
localizes to cytoplasmic reticular structures and plasma membrane
ruffles, and displays a concentration near the nucleus of COS-1 cells.
MTMR14 was more concentrated in structures positive for giantin
(602500), a Golgi marker.

Shen et al. (2009) identified the MTMR14 protein as a phosphatase
predominantly expressed in skeletal and heart muscle. The human and
mouse proteins share 90% amino acid sequence homology.

GENE FUNCTION

By quantitative PCR in mice, Tosch et al. (2006) showed that expression
of Mtmr14 increased with C2C12 myotubule formation and differentiation
in culture. Using in vitro and ex vivo approaches, Tosch et al. (2006)
demonstrated that MTMR14 is a PPIn 3-phosphatase that dephosphorylates
the same substrates as myotubularin, PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P2.

Shen et al. (2009) also demonstrated that MTMR14 dephosphorylates a
variety of PtdInsPs, particularly PtdIns(3,5)P2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tosch et al. (2006) determined that the MTMR14 gene contains 19 exons;
EST database analysis indicated that exons 17 and 18 are alternatives.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Tosch et al. (2006) mapped the MTMR14 gene
to chromosome 3p25.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Tosch et al. (2006) described 2 sporadic cases of centronuclear myopathy
in which each proband carried a heterozygous missense mutation in the
MTMR14 gene. The first proband and his unaffected father carried an
R336Q substitution (611089.0001). A second mutant allele was postulated,
but not identified. The other proband carried a Y462C substitution in
MTMR14 (611089.0002) and an additional missense mutation in DYN2 (E368K;
602378.0007), consistent with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy
(160150). The Y462C mutation was also found in a control individual.
Both variants impaired enzymatic function, the R336Q mutation strongly
and the Y462C mutation to a lesser extent. Tosch et al. (2006) remarked
that myotubular myopathy patients with other characterized mutations in
DYN2 usually have an age of onset in childhood or adulthood, whereas the
age of onset in their patient was neonatal. The report raised the
possibility of MTMR14 being a modifier of the phenotype in some cases of
centronuclear myopathy.

ANIMAL MODEL

Shen et al. (2009) found that Mtmr14-null mice had muscle weakness and
increased fatigue with exercise. Isolated muscles from mutant mice
showed decreased contractile force, exacerbated fatigue, and prolonged
relaxation compared to muscle from wildtype mice. Mtmr14 deficiency
resulted in increased elevated resting calcium levels in myotubes due to
spontaneous calcium leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This
leakage was attributed to decreased activity of Mtmr14 phosphatase
activity and accumulation of substrates, especially PtdIns(3,5)P2 and
PtdIns(3,4)P2. In addition, PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 bound to and
directly activated the RYR1 (180901) calcium release channel in the
sarcoplasmic reticulum. The findings indicated that fine control of
PtdInsP levels in muscle cells is essential for maintaining calcium
homeostasis and muscle performance.

Normal aging is associated with sarcopenia, or a decrease in muscle mass
and function. Romero-Suarez et al. (2010) found that Mtmr14-null mice
manifested features of sarcopenia much earlier (12 to 14 months)
compared to wildtype mice (22 to 24 months). In particular, young and
mature mutant mice behaved like old wildtype mice, indicating earlier
onset of locomotor dysfunction in mutant mice. These changes were
associated with muscle atrophy and a decrease in contractile force and
power in the muscles of mutant mice. Wildtype mice showed downregulation
of Mtmr14 during normal aging, and muscle tissue from both old wildtype
and mutant mature mice showed dysfunctional calcium homeostasis, with
increased resting calcium levels and decreased calcium release from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum when triggered. The findings indicated that
Mtmr14 is a potent regulator of skeletal muscle function under normal
conditions and that its downregulation may contribute to age-related
sarcopenia. Romero-Suarez et al. (2010) concluded that loss of Mtmr14
results in altered PtdIns(3,5)P2 signaling, as well as altered calcium
signaling, which can affect a variety of cell processes.

Dowling et al. (2010) examined zebrafish MTMR14 using gene dosage
manipulation. As with MTM1 (300415) knockdown, morpholino-mediated
knockdown of MTMR14 resulted in morphologic abnormalities, a
developmental motor phenotype characterized by diminished spontaneous
contractions and abnormal escape response, and impaired
excitation-contraction coupling. In contrast to MTM1 knockdown, however,
muscle ultrastructure was unaffected. Double knockdown of MTM1 and
MTMR14 significantly impaired motor function and altered skeletal muscle
ultrastructure. The combined effect of reducing levels of both MTMR14
and MTM1 was significantly more severe than either knockdown alone, an
effect which may be mediated by increased autophagy. The authors
concluded that MTMR14 is required for motor function and, in combination
with MTM1, is required for myocyte homeostasis and normal embryonic
development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, MODIFIER OF
MTMR14, ARG336GLN

Tosch et al. (2006) reported a 12-year old Brazilian boy with
centronuclear myopathy (160150) who presented with neonatal hypotonia,
proximal muscle weakness, and ophthalmoparesis. Both he and his
clinically unaffected father were heterozygous for a 1007G-A transition
in exon 11 of the MTMR14 gene. The mutation was predicted to result in
an arg336-to-gln (R336Q) substitution in a highly conserved region of
the active site of the protein. The mutation was not found in 820
control chromosomes. Immunoprecipitation assays detected a strong
decrease in the phosphatase activity of the R336Q mutant, 22% of the
level of wildtype. A second mutation in MTMR14 was not identified, and
the patient did not have a mutation in exons or splice sites of the DNM2
gene (602378). Tosch et al. (2006) hypothesized that another mutant
allele in either the MTMR14 gene or in another gene must be present.

.0002
MYOPATHY, CENTRONUCLEAR, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT, MODIFIER OF
MTMR14, TYR462CYS

Tosch et al. (2006) reported a 36-year-old woman with centronuclear
myopathy-1 (160150) caused by a heterozygous missense mutation in the
DNM2 gene (E368K; 602378.0007) who also carried a heterozygous 1385A-G
transition in exon 16 of the MTMR14 gene, resulting in a tyr462-to-cys
(Y462C) substitution in a semiconserved region outside of the active
site of the protein. The Y462C mutation was found in 1 of 700 Brazilian
control chromosomes. The Y462C mutant displayed 80% of the phosphatase
activity of the wildtype protein in immunoprecipitation assays. Both
mutations occurred de novo. The patient presented with neonatal
hypotonia, muscle weakness, and ophthalmoparesis. The report raised the
possibility of MTMR14 being a modifier of the phenotype in some cases of
centronuclear myopathy.

604532	TITLE *604532 POLYCYSTIN 2-LIKE 1; PKD2L1
;;PKDL;;
PKD2L;;
POLYCYSTIN-L
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nomura et al. (1998) identified a human gene, which they called PKDL,
that encodes a member of the polycystin protein family designated
polycystin-L. Polycystin-L has 50% amino acid sequence identity to
polycystin-2 (PKD2; 173910) and has striking sequence and structural
resemblance to the pore-forming alpha-1 subunits of calcium channels
(see 601011), suggesting that polycystin-L may function as a subunit of
an ion channel. The PKDL gene encodes a protein of 805 amino acids. The
full-length PKDL transcript is expressed at high levels in fetal
tissues, including kidney and liver, and is downregulated in adult
tissues. Nomura et al. (1998) found no evidence of linkage to PKDL in 6
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease families that were unlinked
to PKD1 (601313) or PKD2 (613095).

Wu et al. (1998) independently identified PKD2L1, which they called
PKD2L. They found that PKD2L is expressed in adult heart and skeletal
muscle, brain, spleen, testis, and retina. They observed alternative
transcripts of 2.4, 2.7, and 3.0 kb. Wu et al. (1998) found that the
PKD2L protein showed 56% identity with polycystin-2 over a 581-amino
acid span; however, the C-terminal 65 residues of PKD2L are unrelated to
PKD2.

GENE STRUCTURE

Guo et al. (2000) determined the exon/intron structure of the PKDL gene.
PKDL contains 16 exons and undergoes alternative splicing. RT-PCR
analysis demonstrated the existence of at least 3 variants: PKDLdel5,
which lacks exon 5 and encodes a deduced protein with a 75-amino acid
in-frame deletion in its extracellular region; PKDLdel456, which lacks
parts of exons 4 and 6 and the whole of exon 5 and encodes a deduced
protein with a 120-amino acid in-frame deletion lacking the second and
third transmembrane domains; and PKDLdel15, which lacks exon 15 and
results in a frameshift and a premature stop codon, thereby truncating
the C-terminal domain of the deduced protein by 45 amino acids. RT-PCR
analysis of RNAs from the HepG2 cell line, fetal brain cortex, liver,
lung, eye, and kidney showed that PKDL undergoes various alternative
splicing in these tissues. The PKDLdel456 variant appears to be
expressed only in transformed lymphoblasts.

GENE FUNCTION

Chen et al. (1999) demonstrated that polycystin-L is a calcium-modulated
nonselective cation channel that is permeable to sodium, potassium, and
calcium ions. Patch-clamp experiments revealed single-channel activity
with a unitary conductance of 137 picosiemens. Channel activity was
substantially increased when either the extracellular or intracellular
calcium-ion concentration was raised, indicating that polycystin-L may
act as a transducer of calcium-mediated signaling in vivo. Chen et al.
(1999) concluded that polycystin-L's large single-channel conductance
and regulation by calcium ions distinguish it from other structurally
related cation channels.

Huang et al. (2006) used a combination of bioinformatics, genetic, and
functional studies to identify PKD2L1 as a candidate mammalian sour
taste sensor. In the tongue, PKD2L1 is expressed in a subset of taste
receptor cells distinct from those responsible for sweet, bitter, and
umami taste. To examine the role of PKD2L1-expressing taste cells in
vivo, Huang et al. (2006) engineered mice with targeted genetic
ablations of selected populations of taste receptor cells. Animals
lacking PKD2L1-expressing cells were completely devoid of taste
responses to sour stimuli. Notably, responses to all other tastants
remained unaffected, proving that the segregation of taste qualities
even extends to ionic stimuli. Huang et al. (2006) concluded that their
results established independent cellular substrates for 4 of the 5 basic
taste modalities, and supported a comprehensive labeled-line mode of
taste coding at the periphery. Notably, PKD2L1 is also expressed in
specific neurons surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord. Huang
et al. (2006) demonstrated that these PKD2L1-expressing neurons send
projections to the central canal, and selectively trigger action
potentials in response to decreases in extracellular pH. The authors
proposed that these cells correspond to the long-sought components of
the cerebrospinal fluid chemosensory system. Huang et al. (2006)
proposed that their results suggest a common basis for acid sensing in
disparate physiologic settings.

Ishimaru et al. (2006) hypothesized that transient receptor potential
(TRP) ion channel proteins other than TRPM5 (604600) might be expressed
in taste cells and be involved in taste transduction. Using in situ
hybridization, they detected expression of Pkd1l3 (607895) and Pkd2l1 in
mouse circumvallate taste cells. Pkd2l1 was expressed in all 3 tongue
taste areas and in the palate taste area, whereas Pkd2l1 was expressed
in circumvallate and foliate papillae, but not in fungiform papillae or
in the palate. Confocal microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation analysis
revealed coexpression of Pkd1l3 and Pkd2l1, but not Trpm5, in the apical
ends of taste cells in circumvallate and foliate papillae. Coexpression
of Pkd1l3 and Pkd2l1 was necessary for inducing changes in intracellular
calcium concentration in response to acid solutions, suggesting that
PKD1L3/PKD2L1 heteromers function as sour taste receptors.

MAPPING

Nomura et al. (1998) mapped the PKDL gene to chromosome 10q24 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization and linked it to D10S603 by radiation
hybrid mapping. Nomura et al. (1998) mapped the mouse homolog of Pkdl to
a syntenic region of chromosome 19 that is deleted in Krd (kidney and
retinal defects) mice. By FISH and analysis of a somatic cell hybrid
mapping panel, Wu et al. (1998) mapped the PKD2L gene to chromosome
10q25. They excluded it as a candidate gene for autosomal recessive
polycystic kidney disease (263200), autosomal dominant polycystic liver
disease (174050), and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease-3
(600666).

602740	TITLE *602740 PROTEIN KINASE, AMP-ACTIVATED, NONCATALYTIC, BETA-1; PRKAB1
;;AMP-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE, NONCATALYTIC, BETA-1;;
AMPK-BETA-1
DESCRIPTION The mammalian 5-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) appears to act
as a metabolic stress-sensing protein kinase. AMPK is a heterotrimeric
protein composed of a catalytic alpha subunit, a noncatalytic beta
subunit, and a noncatalytic gamma subunit. See PRKAA1 (602739) for
additional background.

CLONING

Using PCR with degenerate oligonucleotides based on the rat Ampk-beta-1
protein sequence, Woods et al. (1996) isolated rat liver cDNAs encoding
Ampk-beta-1. Both the Ampk-beta-1 mRNA and protein are widely expressed
in rat tissues. The predicted 270-amino acid protein has a calculated
mass of 30 kD, but Woods et al. (1996) reported that it migrates as a
38-kD protein by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation studies suggested that
Ampk-beta-1 mediates the association of the AMPK heterotrimeric complex
in vitro.

By searching the sequence databases with a rat Ampk-beta-1 cDNA,
Stapleton et al. (1997) identified an EST encoding human AMPK-beta-1.
The human and rat AMPK-beta-1 proteins have 95% amino acid sequence
identity. Thornton et al. (1998) reported that the predicted 271-amino
acid human AMPK-beta-1 protein shares 71% sequence identity with human
AMPK-beta-2 (PRKAB2; 602741). They found that both beta isoforms form
complexes with Ampk-alpha-1 (PRKAA1) and Ampk-alpha-2 (PRKAA2; 600497)
in rat liver and skeletal muscle. Coexpression of the alpha and
AMPK-gamma-1 (PRKAG1; 602742) subunits with either AMPK-beta-1 or
AMPK-beta-2 in mammalian cells did not reveal a significant difference
in AMPK activity between the 2 beta isoforms. Using Western blot
analysis and immunoprecipitation studies, Thornton et al. (1998)
determined that Ampk-beta-1 was expressed at higher levels than
Ampk-beta-2 in rat liver, while Ampk-beta-2 was more abundant in
skeletal muscle. They suggested that the marked difference in expression
patterns of Ampk-beta-1 and Ampk-beta-2 indicates tissue-specific roles
for these isoforms. By Northern blot analysis, Thornton et al. (1998)
found that AMPK-beta-1 was expressed as a 3-kb mRNA in all tissues
tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Minokoshi et al. (2004) investigated the potential role of AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) in the hypothalamus in the regulation of food
intake. Minokoshi et al. (2004) reported that AMPK activity is inhibited
in arcuate and paraventricular hypothalamus by the anorexigenic hormone
leptin (164160), and in multiple hypothalamic regions by insulin
(176730), high glucose, and refeeding. A melanocortin receptor (see
155555) agonist, a potent anorexigen, decreased AMPK activity in
paraventricular hypothalamus, whereas agouti-related protein (602311),
an orexigen, increased AMPK activity. Melanocortin receptor signaling is
required for leptin and refeeding effects of AMPK in the paraventricular
hypothalamus. Dominant-negative AMPK expression in the hypothalamus was
sufficient to reduce food intake and body weight, whereas constitutively
active AMPK increased both. Alterations of hypothalamic AMPK activity
augmented changes in arcuate neuropeptide expression induced by fasting
and feeding. Furthermore, inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK is necessary
for leptin's effects on food intake and body weight, as constitutively
active AMPK blocks these effects. Thus, Minokoshi et al. (2004)
concluded that hypothalamic AMPK plays a critical role in hormonal and
nutrient-derived anorexigenic and orexigenic signals and in energy
balance.

Baba et al. (2006) showed that FNIP1 (610594) interacted with the alpha,
beta, and gamma subunits of AMPK. FNIP1 was phosphorylated by AMPK, and
its phosphorylation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by an AMPK
inhibitor, resulting in reduced FNIP1 expression. FLCN (607273)
phosphorylation was diminished by rapamycin and amino acid starvation
and facilitated by FNIP1 overexpression, suggesting that FLCN
phosphorylation may be regulated by mTOR (FRAP1; 601231) and AMPK
signaling. Baba et al. (2006) concluded that FLCN and FNIP1 may be
involved in energy and/or nutrient sensing through the AMPK and mTOR
signaling pathways.

MAPPING

Stapleton et al. (1997) mapped the human AMPK-beta-1 gene to 12q24.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Xiao et al. (2007) reported the crystal structure of the regulatory
fragment of mammalian AMPK in complexes with AMP and ATP. The phosphate
groups of AMP/ATP lie in a groove on the surface of the gamma domain,
which is lined with basic residues, many of which are associated with
disease-causing mutations. Structural and solution studies revealed that
2 sites on the gamma domain bind either AMP or magnesium ATP, whereas a
third site contains a tightly bound AMP that does not exchange. Xiao et
al. (2007) stated that their binding studies indicated that under
physiologic conditions AMPK mainly exists in its inactive form in
complex with magnesium ATP, which is much more abundant than AMP. Their
modeling studies suggested how changes in the concentration of AMP
enhance AMPK activity levels. The structure also suggested a mechanism
for propagating AMP/ATP signaling whereby a phosphorylated residue from
the alpha and/or beta subunits binds to the gamma subunit in the
presence of AMP but not when ATP is bound.

613952	TITLE *613952 FAMILY WITH SEQUENCE SIMILARITY 46, MEMBER C; FAM46C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FAM46C is a type I interferon (e.g., IFNA1; 147660)-stimulated gene
(ISG) that encodes a protein that appears to enhance replication of
certain viruses (Schoggins et al., 2011).

GENE FUNCTION

Using an overexpression screening approach to test more than 380 ISGs,
including MB21D1, for their ability to inhibit replication of various
human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus (see 609532),
yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (see 610379), chikungunya
virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), and human
immunodeficiency virus-1 (see 609423), Schoggins et al. (2011) found
that FAM46C enhanced replication of YFV and VEEV. FAM46C had little or
no effect on other viruses tested.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the FAM46C gene to chromosome 1p12 based on an
alignment of the FAM46C sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC036516) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607714	TITLE *607714 TNFAIP3-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1; TNIP1
;;NEF-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 1; NAF1;;
A20-BINDING INHIBITOR OF NFKB 1; ABIN1;;
KIAA0113
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Nef protein, Fukushi et al.
(1999) isolated TNIP1, which they designated NAF1, from an activated
leukocyte cDNA library. They obtained full-length NAF1 cDNAs by 5-prime
and 3-prime RACE. Fukushi et al. (1999) identified 2 alternatively
spliced isoforms of NAF1, NAF1-alpha and NAF1-beta, that differ only in
their C-terminal amino acids. NAF1-alpha contains 636 amino acids, and
NAF1-beta contains 640 amino acids. Both isoforms have 4 coiled-coil
domains and a proline-rich C terminus. Northern blot analysis detected a
2.8-kb transcript in all tissues tested, with strong expression in
peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen, and skeletal muscle, and weak
expression in brain. NAF mRNA was also detected in various human
hematopoietic cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Fukushi et al. (1999) determined that the region of NAF1 that interacts
with the HIV-1 Nef protein is located within amino acids 94 to 412.
Overexpression of NAF1 increased cell surface expression of CD4 (186940)
in a reporter cell system, and cotransfection with Nef suppressed
NAF1-induced augmentation of CD4 expression.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen, in vitro pull-down assays, and in vivo
immunoprecipitations, Zhang et al. (2002) determined that NAF1-alpha
interacts directly with ERK2 (176948). EGF (131530) treatment of
NAF1-alpha-transfected human osteosarcoma cells resulted in the
phosphorylation of NAF1-alpha by the EGF/MEK (176872)/ERK2 signal
transduction pathway. Overexpression of NAF1-alpha suppressed ERK2
nuclear translocation following activation and inhibited the
ERK2-dependent transactivation of ELK1 (311040) in a reporter assay.
Zhang et al. (2002) concluded that NAF1 is an attenuator of activated
ERK2 signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Fukushi et al. (1999) determined that the NAF1 gene contains 18 exons.
Exon 1 is untranslated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Fukushi et al. (1999) mapped the NAF1 gene
to chromosome 5q32-q33.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a murine model of allergen-induced asthma, El Bakkouri et al.
(2005) showed that delivery of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see
164011) inhibitory protein Abin1 to the lung epithelium resulted in a
significant reduction of allergen-induced eosinophil infiltration into
the lungs. This reduction was associated with an Abin1-induced decrease
in allergen-specific IgE serum levels and a reduction of eotaxin (CCL11;
601156), Il4 (147780), and Il1b (147720) in bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid. El Bakkouri et al. (2005) concluded that NFKB plays a critical
role in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation and proposed that
inhibiting NFKB could be useful in asthma therapy.

Oshima et al. (2009) showed that mice deficient for Abin1 died during
embryogenesis with fetal liver apoptosis, anemia, and hypoplasia.
Abin1-deficient cells were hypersensitive to tumor necrosis factor (TNF;
191160)-induced programmed cell death, and Tnf deficiency rescued
Abin1-deficient embryos. ABIN1 inhibits caspase-8 (CASP8; 601763)
recruitment to FADD (602457) in TNF-induced signaling complexes,
preventing CASP8 cleavage and programmed cell death. Moreover, ABIN1
directly binds polyubiquitin chains, and this ubiquitin-sensing activity
is required for ABIN1's antiapoptotic activity. Oshima et al. (2009)
concluded that their studies provided insights into how ubiquitination
and ubiquitin-sensing proteins regulate cellular and organismal
survival.

603214	TITLE *603214 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY D, MEMBER 4; ABCD4
;;PEROXISOMAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN 1-LIKE; PXMP1L;;
P70R;;
PMP69
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ABCD4 gene encodes a protein with several transmembrane domains and
ATPase function. There is a cytosolic nucleotide (ATP)-binding domain
with highly conserved motifs at the C terminus. The protein is involved
in the intracellular processing of cobalamin (vitamin B12) (summary by
Coelho et al., 2012).

CLONING

The peroxisomal membrane contains several ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters, including PMP70 (ABCD3; 170995), ALDP (ABCD1; 300371), and
ALDR (ABCD2; 601081). All 3 proteins are ABC half-transporters, which
dimerize to form an active transporter. See 603076. By searching an EST
database for homologs of PMP70 and ALDP, Shani et al. (1997) and
Holzinger et al. (1997) identified PXMP1L cDNAs. They respectively
designated the gene P70R and PMP69. Shani et al. (1997) reported that
the predicted 606-amino acid protein has the structure of an ABC
half-transporter and shares 25 to 27% sequence identity with PMP70,
ALDR, and ALDP. Antibodies against PXMP1L detected a 73-kD protein on
Western blots. Immunofluorescence studies localized the protein to
peroxisomes. Northern blot analysis revealed that PXMP1L was expressed
as a 2.6-kb mRNA in all tissues examined. Holzinger et al. (1997) and
Holzinger et al. (1998) found transcript variants resulting from
alternative splicing and use of alternative polyadenylation sites.

GENE STRUCTURE

Holzinger et al. (1998) reported that the PXMP1L gene contains 19 exons
and spans approximately 16 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and by identity with mapped
clones, Shani et al. (1997) mapped the PXMP1L gene to 14q24. Holzinger
et al. (1998) confirmed this localization by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. They noted that part of a PXMP1L cDNA was included in a
cosmid derived from chromosome 14q24.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Coelho et al. (2012) demonstrated that ABCD4 colocalized with the
lysosomal proteins LAMP1 (153330) and LMBRD1 (612625), the latter of
which is deficient in methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, type
cblF (277380). Cellular studies with mutant ABCD4 alleles indicated that
the ATPase domain of ABCD4 may be involved in the intracellular
processing of vitamin B12 (cobalamin). The biochemical findings and
localization studies suggested that ABCD4 is involved in the lysosomal
release of cbl into the cytoplasm. Although ABCD4 was initially thought
to be a peroxisomal protein, Coelho et al. (2012) provided evidence
against the involvement of peroxisomes in cbl metabolism.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCER), adrenomyeloneuropathy
(AMN), and AMN with cerebral demyelination are the main phenotypic
variants of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD; 300100), which is caused
by mutation in the ABCD1 gene (300371). The biochemical hallmark of ALD
is the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in plasma and
tissues. Asheuer et al. (2005) studied the expression of the ABCD1,
ABCD2, ABCD3 (170995), and ABCD4 genes and 2 VLCFA synthetase genes,
VLCS (SLC27A2; 603247) and BG1 (ACSBG1; 614362), in fibroblasts and
brains from normal controls and ALD patients with the 3 main phenotypes,
and they studied VLCFA concentrations in normal-appearing white matter
from ALD patients with the 3 main phenotypes. The authors showed that
ABCD1-truncating mutations were unlikely to cause variation in the ALD
phenotype. Accumulation of saturated VLCFA in normal-appearing white
matter correlated with ALD phenotype. Expression of ABCD4 and BG1, but
not of the ABCD2, ABCD3, and VLCS genes, tended to correlate with the
severity of the disease, acting early in the pathogenesis of ALD.

In 2 unrelated children with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria
type cblJ (614857), Coelho et al. (2012) identified 4 different
mutations in the ABCD4 gene (603214.0001-603214.0004) in compound
heterozygous state. The mutations, which were found using
microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and exome sequencing, resulted in
a loss of function. The patients presented soon after birth with
hypotonia, respiratory distress, and evidence of bone marrow failure.
One child had mild dysmorphic features, cardiac abnormalities, and
delayed psychomotor development. Biochemical studies confirmed a defect
in cobalamin metabolism and were similar to abnormalities observed in
patients with cblF (277380). Patient cell lines showed no rescue of the
defect when transfected with LMBRD1, suggesting that these 2 genes
function in the same pathway.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
METHYLMALONIC ACIDURIA AND HOMOCYSTINURIA, cblJ TYPE
ABCD4, TYR319CYS

In a North American child with methylmalonic aciduria and
homocystinuria, complementation group J (cblJ; 614857), Coelho et al.
(2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ABCD4
gene: a 956A-G transition resulting in a tyr319-to-cys (Y319C)
substitution in the last transmembrane domain, and a 2-bp insertion
(1746insCT; 603214.0001), resulting in a frameshift and premature
termination (Glu583LeufsTer9) leading to the removal of 14 residues from
the C terminus in the predicted cytosolic nucleotide binding domain. The
mutations were identified by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the
mutations. Neither mutation was found in the 1000 Genomes Project data
set. Expression of wildtype ABCD4 in patient fibroblasts led to rescue
of the biochemical phenotype.

compound heterozygosity for 2 splice site mutations in the ABCD4 gene: a
G-T transversion in intron 5 (542+1G-T), resulting in the skipping of
exon 5 (D143_S181del), which encodes 1 of the transmembrane domains, and
a 1456G-T transversion at the last nucleotide in exon 14, resulting in
the skipping of exons 13 and 14 (G443_S485del; 603214.0004) in the
cytosolic nucleotide binding domain. The mutations were identified by
microcell-mediated chromosome transfer and exome sequencing. Neither
mutation was found in the 1000 Genomes Project data set. Expression of
wildtype ABCD4 in patient fibroblasts led to rescue of the biochemical
phenotype.

;;AN1-TYPE ZINC FINGER DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2B;;
ARSENITE-INDUCIBLE RNA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN-LIKE PROTEIN; AIRAPL;;
AIRAP-LIKE PROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Yun et al. (2008) cloned mouse Zfand2b, which they called Airapl. The
deduced 257-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal AN1-type zinc
finger, followed by 2 ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) and a
C-terminal CAAX box for protein prenylation. The C-terminal domain of
Airapl also has 3 p38 MAP kinase (MAPK14; 600289) phosphorylation sites.
Airapl and Airap (ZFAND2A; 610699) share 60% identity in their
N-terminal ends, but their C termini differ. EST database analysis
detected broad AIRAPL expression in human and mouse tissues.
Immunohistochemical analysis showed that mouse Airapl was expressed in
the endoplasmic reticulum of transfected COS-1 cells, and this
localization required the C-terminal prenylation motif.

GENE FUNCTION

Yun et al. (2008) found that membrane-bound Airapl associated with
proteasomes following sodium arsenite-induced cell stress in mouse
fibroblasts. Cytosolic Airap associated with proteasomes several hours
after Airapl. Binding of Airap and Airapl to proteasomes enhanced the
ability of proteasomes to digest a small peptide substrate. Domain
swapping between Airap and Airapl revealed that the C-terminal domain of
Airapl directed arsenite-regulated proteasome complex formation. This
C-terminal domain of Airapl was phosphorylated by p38 MAP kinase, but
this phosphorylation did not alter arsenite-regulated proteasome
association. C. elegans contains a single AIRAP ortholog, Aip1, and
worms depleted of Aip1 were hypersensitive to arsenite- and unfolded
protein-induced stress and showed reduced life span. Yun et al. (2008)
concluded that AIRAP and AIRAPL enhance proteasome function during cell
stress.

Hassan et al. (2009) used a transgenic C. elegans Alzheimer disease (AD;
104300) model to identify cellular responses to proteotoxicity resulting
from expression of the human beta-amyloid peptide (APP; 104760).
Arsenite-inducible protein-1 (Aip1) was upregulated in A-beta-expressing
animals. Overexpression of Aip1 protected against, while RNAi knockdown
of Aip1 exacerbated, A-beta toxicity. Aip1 overexpression also reduced
accumulation of A-beta in this model, which is consistent with Aip1
enhancing protein degradation. Transgenic expression of human Aip1
homologs AIRAPL, but not AIRAP, suppressed A-beta toxicity in C.
elegans. The Aip1 farnesylation site (which is absent from AIRAP) is
essential for an Aip1 prolongevity function, and an Aip1 mutant lacking
the predicted farnesylation site failed to protect against A-beta
toxicity. Hassan et al. (2009) proposed that Aip1 may play a role in the
regulation of protein turnover and protection against A-beta toxicity
and suggested that AIRAPL may be the functional mammalian homolog of C.
elegans Aip1.

MAPPING

DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Marine et al. (1994) assigned the ZNF83 gene (also known as HPF1) to
chromosome 19 by screening a human/rodent hybrid panel and localized the
gene further to 19q13.3-q13.4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and
digital imaging microscopy.

HISTORY

Conserved structural motifs define large families of nucleic acid
binding proteins in eukaryotes. The C2H2-type zinc finger motif,
conferring both specific RNA and DNA binding activities, was first
detected within the amino acid sequence of the Xenopus transcription
factor IIIA (Miller et al., 1985). Thereafter, vertebrate genomes were
shown to encode hundreds of so-called zinc finger proteins (ZFPs).
Subfamilies were defined on the basis of conserved sequence elements
outside the finger repeat, such as the KRAB domain. Several members of
these subfamilies were found to have a clustered genomic organization.

;;UFD2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF, A; UFD2A;;
KIAA0684
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human brain cDNA
library, Ishikawa et al. (1998) cloned UBE4B, which they designated
KIAA0684. The deduced 903-amino acid protein shares weak similarity with
Dictyostelium NOSA, a developmental regulator involved in proteasomal
degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (Koegl et al., 1999). See also
UBE4A, 603753. Using RT-PCR, Ishikawa et al. (1998) found uniformly high
KIAA0684 expression in all 10 human tissues examined. In vitro
translation resulted in a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 92
kD by SDS-PAGE.

Kaneko et al. (2003) cloned mouse Ube4b, which they called Ufd2a, from
testis and T cell cDNA libraries. The deduced 1,174-amino acid protein
has a C-terminal U-box domain including a proline residue perfectly
conserved among U-box proteins. Western blot analysis detected Ufd2a at
an apparent molecular mass of 140 kD in most mouse tissues examined,
with highest abundance in cerebrum, cerebellum, and skeletal muscle.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed localization of Ufd2a in the
cytoplasm of cortical pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By expressing epitope-tagged mouse proteins in human embryonic kidney
cells, Kaneko et al. (2003) showed that Ufd2a interacted with Vcp
(601023), a AAA-family ATPase implicated in protein folding.

Using an in vitro ubiquitination assay with mouse and human UBE4B and
MDM2 (164785), Wu et al. (2011) showed that either UBE4B or MDM2 alone
led to monoubiquitination of the tumor suppressor p53 (TP53; 191170),
while UBE4B in combination with MDM2 promoted p53 polyubiquitination.
Reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis and protein pull-down assays
revealed that UBE4B interacted directly with MDM2. Overexpression and
knockdown studies in mouse and human cell lines revealed that
interaction of UBE4B with MDM2 reduced the half-life of p53 via
proteasome-mediated degradation and caused repression of p53-dependent
transactivation and apoptosis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Krona et al. (2003) determined that the UBE4B gene contains 28 exons.

Kaneko et al. (2003) found that the mouse Ube4b gene contains 27 coding
exons. The promoter region has a CpG island that contains a functional
cis-acting element, but no TATA or CAAT boxes.

MAPPING

Using radiation hybrid analysis, Ishikawa et al. (1998) mapped the UBE4B
gene to chromosome 1. By genomic sequence analysis, Krona et al. (2003)
mapped the UBE4B gene to chromosome 1p36.3-p36.2.

150000	TITLE *150000 LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE A; LDHA
;;LDH, SUBUNIT M
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The LDHA gene encodes the A subunit of lactate dehydrogenase (EC
1.1.1.27), an enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of lactate and
pyruvate. The A subunit is expressed in skeletal muscle. Other isoforms
include LDHB (150100), expressed in cardiac muscle, and LDHC (150150),
expressed in testes (Tsujibo et al., 1985; Chung et al., 1985).

CLONING

Tsujibo et al. (1985) isolated cDNA clones corresponding to the human
LDHA gene from a human fibroblast cDNA library. The predicted 332-amino
acid sequence had a molecular mass of 36.7 kD and showed 92% homology to
the porcine Ldha polypeptide. A nonfunctional pseudogene was also
isolated.

GENE STRUCTURE

Chung et al. (1985) determined that the LDHA gene contains 7 exons and
spans about 12 kb.

MAPPING

Studies using human-mouse somatic cell hybrids indicated that the LDHA
and LDHB loci are not linked (Nabholz et al., 1969). By study of cell
hybrids, LDHA was assigned to the short arm of chromosome 11 by Francke
and Busby (1975).

By the study of cells from 4 persons with different interstitial
deletions of 11p, Francke et al. (1977) assigned the LDHA locus to
11p1203-11p1208. At HGM8, controversy arose over the mapping of LDHA
(see Grzeschik and Kazazian, 1985). HGM8 reported the location as
11p14-p12. Lebo et al. (1985) and Lewis et al. (1985) placed the locus
at a more distal position.

Yang-Feng et al. (1986) did in situ hybridization studies in cell lines
from 2 persons with apparently balanced translocations involving 11p13.
Their findings excluded LDHA from any region proximal to 11p13 and
localized the gene to 11p15-p14.

Scrable et al. (1990) demonstrated that LDHA is located in band 11p15.4.

GENE FUNCTION

Centrosomal proteins (e.g., 117139, 117140, 117141, 117143) have been
studied mainly with anticentrosome serum. Using a spontaneously arising
rabbit anticentrosome serum with strong human specificity, Gosti et al.
(1987) identified specific antigens in isolated centrosomes which
reacted with several noncentrosomal proteins, notably, lactate
dehydrogenase.

Anderson and Kovacik (1981) identified an unusual isozyme of lactate
dehydrogenase, which they designated lactate dehydrogenase K (LDHK), in
cells transformed by the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus. They examined 16
different human carcinomas and found that 11 had LDHK activity 10- to
500-fold over the level in adjoining nontumor tissue. Li et al. (1988)
determined that this cancer-associated lactate dehydrogenase is a
tyrosylphosphorylated form of LDHA. The protein was found to be
complexed with 21-kD, 30-kD, and 56-kD proteins.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Nance et al. (1963) observed a genetically determined variant LDH in the
red cells of 4 members of 2 generations of a Brazilian family. The
mutation involved the A subunit. This was the first instance in which
practical considerations permitted demonstration of the variant in
multiple relatives. Unlike the findings of Shaw and Barto (1963) in
Peromyscus and of Boyer et al. (1963) in man, the findings in the
Brazilian family did not suggest random association between the products
of the mutant and wildtype alleles.

LDH variants, involving either the A or the B subunit, seem to be
unusually frequent in India (Das et al., 1970).

- Glycogen Storage Disease XI

In a patient with LDHA deficiency, or glycogen storage disease XI
(GSD11; 612933), reported by Maekawa et al. (1986), Maekawa et al.
(1990) found homozygosity for a 20-bp deletion in exon 6 of the LDHA
gene (150000.0001). Maekawa et al. (1991) demonstrated the same mutation
in 18 persons from the 4 known affected families in Japan.

EVOLUTION

Markert et al. (1975) suggested that the ancestral vertebrate LDH was an
A4-like enzyme since lampreys have only the A4 isozyme. Sidell and
Beland (1980) presented evidence supporting this view: the hagfish has a
B4 enzyme but it diverges less from A4 enzyme than does the B4 of other
fishes and higher vertebrates. A close phylogenic relative of the
lamprey, the Atlantic hagfish lives under sustained hypoxic conditions
that may have favored evolution of a B4 enzyme. A4 is the muscle
isozyme, B4 is the heart isozyme, and C4 is the testicular isozyme.

Morizot (1984) collated linkage data from lower vertebrates and several
mammalian species. The lower vertebrates included poeciliid fishes
(Xiphophorus and Poeciliopsis), salmonid fishes (trout), and frogs
(Rana). He postulated a 12-locus ancestral synteny group consisting of
isocitrate dehydrogenase (on human 2 and 15), 3 LDH loci (on human 11
and 12), HEXA (on human 15), nucleoside phosphorylase (on human 14),
pyruvate kinase (on human 15), MPI (on human 15), PEPB (on human 12),
citrate synthase (on human 12), TPI (on human 12), and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (on human 12). If the 3 LDH
loci are part of the primordial synteny group, LDH genes may have
originated by intrachromosomal duplication rather than by
polyploidization as has been thought.

ANIMAL MODEL

In trout, the loci coding for LDH subunits A and B are linked (Morrison
and Wright, 1966). In the mouse, Chang et al. (1979) found that the A
and B subunits are more similar to each other in amino acid sequence
than to the C subunit.

In the mouse, Merkle et al. (1992) found that homozygosity for absent
LDHA subunit led to early postimplantation death. Merkle et al. (1992)
suggested that the fact that human subjects with a complete absence of
LDHA subunits are fully viable may be due to the fact that, in contrast
with the situation in the mouse, LDHB predominates in the human fetus.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XI
LDHA, 20-BP DEL, EX6

In a patient with lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency, or glycogen
storage disease XI (612933), reported by Maekawa et al. (1986), Maekawa
et al. (1990) found a 20-bp deletion in exon 6 of the LDHA gene,
resulting in a frameshift, premature termination, and complete lack of
the alpha subunits of LDH. The predicted incomplete LDHA subunit
contained only 259 instead of 331 amino acids and appeared to be
degraded rapidly, since no protein was detected immunologically. Maekawa
et al. (1990) stated that 'this female patient with the LDHA deficiency
frequently complained of uterine stiffness during her pregnancy. Uterine
stiffness was a problem in the early stage of delivery and, thus, she
required a Caesarean section.'

In a fragment of the LDHA gene amplified by PCR using 2 primers specific
for the gene, Maekawa et al. (1991) demonstrated the same mutation in 18
persons from the 4 known affected families in Japan.

Miyajima et al. (1993) identified the exon 6 deletion in 2 adult
Japanese sisters that had muscle stiffness following strenuous exercise
since the teens and age 9, respectively. Both had had cesarean sections
because the 'uterus was too stiff in the early stage of delivery.'

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE XI
LDHA, GLU328TER

Maekawa et al. (1991) used the ratio of LDHB to LDHA subunits in
erythrocytes as a means of identifying individuals heterozygous for LDHA
deficiency (GSD11; 612933). In one such individual, they identified a
G-to-T transversion in the LDHA gene, resulting in a glu328-to-ter
(E328X) substitution. There were no manifestations in this heterozygous
subject; however, homozygotes would presumably be affected.

605353	TITLE *605353 GHRELIN; GHRL
;;GROWTH HORMONE SECRETAGOGUE RECEPTOR LIGAND;;
MOTILIN-RELATED PEPTIDE
OBESTATIN, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ghrelin is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue
receptor (GHSR; 601898) and is involved in regulating growth hormone
(GH; 139250) release. Ghrelin is derived from a preprohormone called
preproghrelin, which also generates a second peptide called obestatin
(Zhang et al., 2005). Obestatin is an endogenous ligand for the orphan G
protein-coupled receptor GPR39 (602886) and is involved in satiety and
decreased food intake.

CLONING

Small synthetic molecules called growth hormone secretagogues (GHSs)
stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. They act
through the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, a G protein-coupled
receptor. Kojima et al. (1999) reported the purification and
identification in rat stomach of an endogenous ligand specific for GHSR.
The purified ligand is a peptide of 28 amino acids in which the serine-3
residue is n-octanoylated. The acylated peptide specifically releases GH
both in vivo and in vitro, and O-n-octanoylation at serine-3 is
essential for the activity. Kojima et al. (1999) designated the
GH-releasing peptide 'ghrelin' ('ghre' is the Proto-Indo-European root
of the word 'grow'). Human ghrelin is homologous to rat ghrelin apart
from 2 amino acids. The occurrence of ghrelin in both rat and human
indicates that GH release from the pituitary may be regulated not only
by hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH; 139190), but
also by ghrelin. Human preproghrelin, isolated from a stomach cDNA
library, consists of 117 amino acids. Rat and human preproghrelins are
82.9% identical. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues showed that
preproghrelin mRNA of 0.62 kb occurs in stomach. In situ hybridization
indicated that ghrelin mRNA is found in the region from the neck to the
base of the oxyntic gland. Ghrelin-immunoreactive cells in the stomach
have the same distribution as that found using in situ hybridization.
The distribution pattern and morphologic features of the labeled and
immunostained cells showed that ghrelin cells are endocrine cells.

Kojima et al. (1999) detected a ghrelin transcript in brain by RT-PCR
amplification but not by Northern blot analysis. Immunohistochemical
analyses performed after colchicine treatment revealed that
ghrelin-immunoreactive neurons were localized in the hypothalamic
arcuate nucleus.

Tanaka et al. (2001) cloned a splice variant of mouse ghrelin, which
they called ghrelin gene-derived transcript (GGDT), from adult mouse
testis. The variant encodes a deduced 54-amino acid peptide generated by
alternative exon 1 usage and alternative splicing. Northern blot
analysis showed that GGDT expression is limited to the mouse testis and
is developmentally regulated, being absent in testis at 2 weeks of age
and increasing to reach adult expression levels at 4 weeks of age.
Tanaka et al. (2001) found no significant change in the abundance of
full-length ghrelin mRNA in the stomach from 2 to 8 weeks of age.

- Obestatin

Zhang et al. (2005) searched for orthologs of the human ghrelin gene and
compared preproghrelin sequences from 11 mammalian species. In addition
to the known ghrelin mature peptide, which immediately follows the
signal peptide, they identified another conserved region that was
flanked by potential convertase cleavage sites. This region encoded a
putative 23-amino acid peptide with a flanking conserved glycine residue
at the C terminus, suggesting that it might be amidated. Zhang et al.
(2005) named this ghrelin-associated peptide obestatin, from the Latin
'obedere,' to devour, and 'statin,' denoting suppression.

GENE FUNCTION

Kojima et al. (1999) found that ghrelin circulates in healthy human
blood at a considerable plasma concentration (117.2 +/- 37.2
fmol/ml(-1); n = 6); this, together with the finding that ghrelin, when
injected intravenously, induces GH release, suggested to the authors
that this molecule is produced in and secreted from the stomach,
circulating in the bloodstream to act on the pituitary.

Takaya et al. (2000) studied GH-releasing activity and other effects
generated by ghrelin in 4 normal men aged 28 to 37 years. They
demonstrated that ghrelin strongly stimulates GH release in humans in a
dose-dependent manner. Per mol, ghrelin is more potent for GH release
than GHRH. The lowest dose of ghrelin used (0.2 microg/kg) led to
massive GH release (43.3 +/- 6.0 ng/mL), with minimum effects on ACTH or
PRL (176760). Ghrelin administration did not change serum LH (see
118850), FSH (136530), or TSH (188540) levels.

Kluge et al. (2007) investigated the effect of pulsatile ghrelin
administration on the nocturnal secretion patterns of LH and
testosterone in 10 healthy young men. They found that ghrelin caused
both a delay and suppression of the amplitude of LH pulses. They
concluded that, as in nonhuman mammals, ghrelin may affect the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis predominantly by suppressing
secretion of LH.

Tschop et al. (2000) showed that peripheral daily administration of
ghrelin caused weight gain by reducing fat utilization in mice and rats.
Intracerebroventricular administration of ghrelin generated a
dose-dependent increase in food intake and body weight. Rat serum
ghrelin concentrations were increased by fasting and were reduced by
refeeding or oral glucose administration, but not by water ingestion.
Tschop et al. (2000) proposed that ghrelin, in addition to its role in
regulating GH secretion, signals the hypothalamus when an increase in
metabolic efficiency is necessary.

Nakazato et al. (2001) demonstrated that ghrelin is involved in the
hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis. Intracerebroventricular
injections of ghrelin strongly stimulated feeding in rats and increased
body weight gain. Ghrelin also increased feeding in rats that were
genetically deficient in growth hormone. Antighrelin immunoglobulin G
robustly suppressed feeding. After intracerebroventricular ghrelin
administration, FOS protein (164810), a marker of neuronal activation,
was found in regions of primary importance in the regulation of feeding,
including neuropeptide Y (NPY; 162640) neurons and agouti-related
protein (AGRP; 602311) neurons. Antibodies and antagonists of NPY and
AGRP abolished ghrelin-induced feeding. Ghrelin augmented NPY gene
expression and blocked leptin (LEP; 164160)-induced feeding reduction,
implying that there is a competitive interaction between ghrelin and
leptin in feeding regulation. Nakazato et al. (2001) concluded that
ghrelin is a physiologic mediator of feeding and probably has a function
in growth regulation by stimulating feeding and release of growth
hormone.

Date et al. (2001) demonstrated a role for ghrelin in the central
regulation of gastric function. Specifically, intracerebroventricular
administration of ghrelin stimulated gastric acid secretion in a
dose-dependent and atropine-sensitive manner. Vagotomy abolished gastric
acid secretion. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the induction of Fos
expression in the nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsomotor nucleus
of the rat vagus nerve.

Cummings et al. (2002) investigated plasma ghrelin levels after weight
loss induced by diet or by gastric bypass surgery. They reasoned that if
circulating ghrelin participates in the adaptive response to weight
loss, its levels should rise with dieting. Because ghrelin is produced
primarily in the stomach, weight loss after gastric bypass surgery might
be accompanied by impaired ghrelin secretion. They found an increase in
the plasma ghrelin level with diet-induced weight loss. Gastric bypass
was associated with markedly suppressed ghrelin levels, possibly
contributing to the weight-reducing effect of the procedure.

Leonetti et al. (2003) observed a significant difference in plasma
ghrelin levels between laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP)
and laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB), suggesting
that each procedure could induce weight loss by a different mechanism in
which ghrelin could be involved.

Kojima et al. (2001) reviewed the role of ghrelin. This peptide is found
in the secretory granules of X/A-like cells, a distinct endocrine cell
type found in the submucosal layer of the stomach (Date et al., 2000).
These cells contain round, compact, electron-dense granules and are
filled with ghrelin. Ghrelin immunoreactive cells are also found in the
small and large intestines.

Cowley et al. (2003) discovered expression of ghrelin in a theretofore
uncharacterized group of neurons adjacent to the third ventricle between
the dorsal, ventral, paraventricular, and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei.
These neurons send efferents onto key hypothalamic circuits, including
those producing NPY, AGRP, proopiomelanocortin (POMC; 176830) products,
and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH; 122560). Within the
hypothalamus, ghrelin bound mostly on presynaptic terminals of NPY
neurons. Using electrophysiologic recordings, Cowley et al. (2003) found
that ghrelin stimulated the activity of arcuate NPY neurons and mimicked
the effect of NPY in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.
Cowley et al. (2003) proposed that at these sites, release of ghrelin
may stimulate the release of orexigenic peptides and neurotransmitters,
thus representing a novel regulatory circuit controlling energy
homeostasis.

Abizaid et al. (2006) demonstrated that ghrelin bound to neurons of the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice and rats, where it triggered
increased dopamine neuronal activity, synapse formation, and dopamine
turnover in the nucleus accumbens in a Ghsr-dependent manner. Direct VTA
administration of ghrelin triggered feeding, while intra-VTA delivery of
a selective Ghsr antagonist blocked the orexigenic effect of circulating
ghrelin and blunted rebound feeding following fasting. In addition,
ghrelin- and Ghsr-deficient mice showed attenuated feeding responses to
restricted feeding schedules.

Dixit et al. (2004) demonstrated that ghrelin and its receptor, GHSR,
are expressed in human T lymphocytes and monocytes, where ghrelin acts
via GHSR to inhibit specifically the expression of proinflammatory
anorectic cytokines such as IL1-beta (147720), IL6 (147620), and
TNF-alpha (191160). Ghrelin led to a dose-dependent inhibition of
leptin-induced cytokine expression, whereas leptin upregulated GHSR
expression on human T lymphocytes. Dixit et al. (2004) proposed the
existence of a reciprocal regulatory network by which ghrelin and leptin
control immune cell activation and inflammation. In a murine model of
endotoxemia, Dixit et al. (2004) also showed that ghrelin has potent
antiinflammatory effects and attenuates endotoxin-induced anorexia.

Pagotto et al. (2003) investigated circulating ghrelin levels in a group
of hypogonadal men before and after therapeutic intervention aiming at
normalization of low testosterone concentrations. After the 6-month
replacement testosterone therapy, ghrelin levels of hypogonadal patients
increased and did not differ significantly in comparison with both
control groups. The positive correlation between ghrelin and androgens
still persisted after testosterone replacement therapy, after adjusting
for confounding variables. The authors concluded that androgens modulate
circulating ghrelin concentrations in humans.

Farquhar et al. (2003) measured ghrelin in neonates who were small
(SGA), appropriate (AGA), or large (LGA) for gestational age and
observed that ghrelin concentration was 40% higher in SGA neonates
compared with AGA and LGA neonates. There was a positive correlation
between ghrelin and gestational age in AGA/LGA and a negative
correlation in SGA neonates. The authors suggested that ghrelin may play
a physiologic role in fetal adaptation to intrauterine malnutrition.

To determine whether ghrelin releases GH by a pituitary or a
hypothalamic action, Popovic et al. (2003) compared a group of patients
with organic lesions mainly in the hypothalamic area with matched
controls. Patients showed a severe GH deficiency after hypothalamic
stimulation by insulin tolerance test, but partial response after GHRH
(139190) administration. The authors concluded that when hypothalamic
structures are not operative, ghrelin, either alone or in combination
with GHRH, is not able to significantly release GH. The authors
postulated a hypothalamic point of action for ghrelin-induced GH
secretion.

The studies of Corbetta et al. (2003) suggested that carcinoids and
pancreatic tumors rarely cause ghrelin hypersecretion. However, in this
series, 1 pancreatic ghrelinoma not associated with clinical features of
acromegaly was identified.

After administration of ghrelin, Doi et al. (2006) observed increases in
Ia2-beta (PTPRN2; 601698) in mouse brain, pancreas, and insulinoma cell
lines, but not Ia2 (PTPRN; 601773). Administration of ghrelin or
overexpression of Ia2-beta inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion in insulinoma cells, and inhibition of Ia2-beta overexpression
by RNA interference ameliorated ghrelin's inhibitory effects on
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Doi et al. (2006) suggested that
the inhibitory effects of ghrelin on glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion are at least partly due to increased expression of Ia2-beta
induced by ghrelin.

Leidy et al. (2004) studied the effects of a 3-month energy
deficit-imposing diet and exercise intervention on circulating ghrelin
in healthy women of normal weight. Ghrelin significantly increased over
time in the weight-loss group compared with the controls and the
weight-stable group (P less than 0.05). Changes in ghrelin were
negatively correlated with changes in body weight (r = -0.61; P less
than 0.05). Body fat, body weight, and resting metabolic rate
significantly decreased in the weight-loss group before the increase in
ghrelin. The authors concluded that ghrelin responds in a compensatory
manner to changes in energy homeostasis in healthy young women, and that
ghrelin exhibits particular sensitivity to changes in body weight.

Yang et al. (2008) found that mouse Goat (MBOAT4; 611940) octanoylated
ghrelin following cotransfection of Goat and preproghrelin in cultured
endocrine cell lines. Mutation analysis showed that Goat octanoylated
ghrelin on ser3, a modification required for its endocrine effects.

Checchi et al. (2007) studied the diagnostic use of the measurement of
serum ghrelin compared with other markers of gastric damage in
predicting the presence of atrophic body gastritis (ABG) in patients
with autoimmune gastritis. All 233 patients with autoimmune gastritis
and 211 control subjects were screened for circulating parietal cell
antibodies (PCAs) and were tested for serum ghrelin, gastrin (137250),
pepsinogen I (see 169700) and II (169740), and anti-Helicobacter pylori
antibody levels. A total of 52 patients and 28 control subjects
underwent a gastric endoscopy. In PCA/positive patients, mean serum
ghrelin levels were significantly lower, and mean serum gastrin levels
were significantly higher with respect to PCA/negative patients. Checchi
et al. (2007) concluded that ghrelin secretion is negatively affected by
autoimmune gastritis, and its serum level represents the most sensitive
and specific noninvasive marker for selecting patients at high risk for
ABG.

Andrews et al. (2008) showed that ghrelin initiates robust changes in
hypothalamic mitochondrial respiration in mice that are dependent on
uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2; 601693). Activation of this mitochondrial
mechanism is critical for ghrelin-induced mitochondrial proliferation
and electric activation of NPY (162640)/AgRP (602311) neurons, for
ghrelin-triggered synaptic plasticity of proopiomelanocortin (POMC;
176830)-expressing neurons, and for ghrelin-induced food intake. The
UCP2-dependent action of ghrelin on NPY/AgRP neurons is driven by a
hypothalamic fatty acid oxidation pathway involving AMPK (see 602739),
CPT1 (600528), and free radicals that are scavenged by UCP2. Andrews et
al. (2008) concluded that their results revealed a signaling modality
connecting mitochondria-mediated effects of G protein-coupled receptors
on neuronal function and associated behavior.

In studies in mice lacking Mboat4 and mice overexpressing Mboat4,
Kirchner et al. (2009) demonstrated that Mboat4 is regulated by nutrient
availability, depends on specific dietary lipids as acylation
substrates, and links ingested lipids to energy expenditure and body fat
mass. Kirchner et al. (2009) concluded that ghrelin acylation and the
secretion of acylated ghrelin probably represent 2 independent
processes, and that the ghrelin-MBOAT4 system is a signaling pathway
that alerts the central nervous system to the presence of dietary
calories, rather than to their absence, as had been commonly accepted.

- Role in Prader-Willi Syndrome

To determine whether ghrelin is elevated in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS;
176270), Delparigi et al. (2002) measured fasting plasma ghrelin
concentration, body composition, and subjective ratings of hunger in 7
subjects with PWS and 30 healthy subjects who had fasted overnight. The
mean plasma ghrelin concentration was higher in PWS than in the
reference population and this difference remained significant after
adjustment for percentage of body fat. A positive correlation was found
between plasma ghrelin and subjective ratings of hunger. The authors
concluded that ghrelin is elevated in subjects with PWS. They also
suggested that ghrelin may be responsible, at least in part, for the
hyperphagia observed in PWS.

Haqq et al. (2003) measured fasting serum ghrelin levels in children
with PWS with an average age of 9.5 years and body mass index (BMI) of
31.3 kilograms per square meter. The PWS group was compared with 4
control groups: normal weight controls, obese children, and children
with melanocortin-4 receptor mutations and leptin deficiency. Ghrelin
levels in children with PWS were significantly elevated (3-4 fold)
compared with BMI-matched obese controls. The authors concluded that
elevation of serum ghrelin levels to the degree documented in this study
may play a role as an orexigenic factor driving the insatiable appetite
and obesity found in PWS.

Feigerlova et al. (2008) studied total plasma ghrelin levels in 40
children with PWS and 84 controls from 2 months to 17 years. Plasma
ghrelin levels were higher in children with PWS than controls, both in
the youngest children below 3 years who were not receiving GH (139250)
(771 vs 233 pg/ml, P less than 0.0001) and in the children older than 3
years, all of whom were treated with GH (428 vs 159 pg/ml, P less than
0.0001). The authors concluded that plasma ghrelin levels in children
with PWS are elevated at any age, including during the first years of
life, thus preceding the development of obesity.

- Obestatin

In addition to ghrelin, the preproghrelin peptide also produces
obestatin. Contrary to the appetite-stimulating effects of ghrelin,
Zhang et al. (2005) demonstrated that treatment of rats with obestatin
suppressed food intake, inhibited jejunal contraction, and decreased
body weight gain. Intraperitoneal injection of amidated human obestatin
in adult male mice resulted in suppressed food intake in a time- and
dose-dependent manner. Intracerebroventricular treatment with obestatin
also decreased food intake, similar to the anorexigenic effect of the
synthetic melanocortin (176830) agonist MTII (melanotan-II). In
contrast, treatment with the nonamidated obestatin was less effective.

Chartrel et al. (2007) were unable to reproduce the finding of Zhang et
al. (2005) that obestatin bound to the orphan G protein-coupled receptor
GPR39 (602886). In response to the comments by Chartrel et al. (2007),
Zhang et al. (2007) stated that they also could not reproduce this
finding. However, Zhang et al. (2007) stated that they could reproduce
their original findings on the in vivo effects of obestatin in mice
(decrease in food intake, gastric emptying responses, and body weight
gain) under precise experimental conditions.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Korbonits et al. (2002) studied the ghrelin gene in a group of 70 tall
and obese children. They found 10 SNPs. One common polymorphism of the
ghrelin gene, leu72 to met (L72M; 605353.0002), corresponding to an
amino acid change in the tail of the preproghrelin molecule, was
significantly associated with children with a higher BMI (P = 0.001),
and with lower insulin secretion during the first part of an oral
glucose tolerance test (P = 0.05), although no difference in glucose
levels was noted. The authors concluded that variations in the ghrelin
gene contribute to obesity in children and may modulate glucose-induced
insulin secretion.

Ukkola et al. (2001) reported an arg51-to-gln polymorphism (R51Q;
605353.0001) in the ghrelin gene associated with obesity.

Hinney et al. (2002) screened the ghrelin coding region in 215 extremely
obese German children and adolescents (study group 1) and 93
normal-weight students (study group 2) by single-strand conformation
polymorphism analysis (SSCP). They found 2 previously described SNPs,
R51Q (605353.0001) and L72M (605353.0002), in similar frequencies in
study groups 1 and 2. Hence, they could not confirm the previous
finding. Additionally, 2 novel variants were identified within the
coding region. They detected a nonconservative amino acid change from
gln to leu at codon 90 (605353.0003). They also detected a frameshift
mutation (605353.0004) in 1 healthy normal-weight individual. The
authors concluded that none of the variants seem to influence weight
regulation.

To determine whether mutations in GHRL influence eating behavior and
risk for metabolic syndrome (see 605552), obesity, diabetes, and related
traits, Steinle et al. (2005) genotyped 856 Amish samples for 3 missense
polymorphisms in GHRL, R51Q (605363.0001), L72M (605363.0002) (dbSNP
rs696217), and Q90L (605363.0003) (dbSNP rs4684677) and performed
association analyses with eating behavior traits and metabolic syndrome.
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was lower among those carrying the
51Q allele (3.8 vs 15.8%; age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio = 0.22; P =
0.031). The L72M variant was also associated with increased prevalence
of metabolic syndrome (23.2 vs 13.4%; age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio =
2.57; P = 0.02) as well as higher fasting glucose, lower high density
lipoprotein, and higher triglyceride levels (P = 0.02, P = 0.007, and P
= 0.04, respectively). The 2 variants were not in linkage disequilibrium
with each other, suggesting independent effects. The authors concluded
that mutations in GHRL may confer risk for the metabolic syndrome.

MAPPING

Scott (2000) mapped the human gene encoding ghrelin to 3p26-p25 based on
sequence similarity between the ghrelin precursor (GenBank GENBANK
AB029434) and a BAC (GenBank GENBANK AC008116) mapped to 3p26-p25.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wortley et al. (2004) generated ghrelin-null mice which were viable and
exhibited normal growth rates as well as normal spontaneous food intake
patterns, normal basal levels of hypothalamic orexigenic and
anorexigenic neuropeptides, and no impairment of reflexive hyperphagia
after fasting. Wortley et al. (2004) concluded that endogenous ghrelin
is not an essential regulator of food intake. Analyses of the
ghrelin-null mice demonstrated increased use of fat as a fuel source
when placed on a high-fat diet, indicating that endogenous ghrelin plays
a prominent role in determining the type of metabolic substrate (e.g.,
fat vs carbohydrate) that is used for maintenance of energy balance,
particularly under conditions of high fat intake.

Wortley et al. (2005) demonstrated that male Ghrl-null mice are
protected from the rapid weight gain induced by early exposure to a
high-fat diet; the reduced weight gain was associated with decreased
adiposity and increased energy expenditure and locomotor activity as the
animals aged. Despite the absence of ghrelin, these Ghrl-null mice
showed a paradoxical preservation of the GH/IGF1 (147440) axis. Wortley
et al. (2005) suggested that endogenous ghrelin plays an important role
in the metabolic adaptation to nutrient availability.

Zigman et al. (2005) generated Ghsr (601898)-null mice and observed that
ghrelin administration failed to acutely stimulate food intake or
activate arcuate nucleus neurons. When fed a high-fat diet, both female
and male Ghsr-null mice ate less food, stored less of their consumed
calories, preferentially utilized fat as an energy substrate, and
accumulated less body weight and adiposity than control mice. Ghsr-null
mice also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in both
respiratory quotient and locomotor activity compared to wildtype, and
their blood glucose levels were significantly lower than wildtype mice
of similar weight and body composition. Zigman et al. (2005) concluded
that ghrelin-responsive pathways are an important component of
coordinated body weight control, and suggested that ghrelin signaling is
required for development of the full phenotype of diet-induced obesity.

In rats undergoing chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of ghrelin,
Theander-Carrillo et al. (2006) observed increases in the glucose
utilization rate of white and brown adipose tissue with no effect on
skeletal muscle. In white adipocytes, mRNA expression of various fat
storage-promoting enzymes was markedly increased, whereas mRNA
expression of CPT1A (600528), which controls the rate-limiting step in
fat oxidation, was decreased. In brown adipocytes, central ghrelin
infusion resulted in lowered expression of the thermogenesis-related
mitochondrial UCP1 (113730) and UCP3 (602044). These ghrelin effects
were dose-dependent, occurred independently of ghrelin-induced
hyperphagia, and seemed to be mediated by the sympathetic nervous
system; none of the effects on adipocyte metabolism were observed
following peripheral administration of equal amounts of ghrelin.
Theander-Carrillo et al. (2006) concluded that central ghrelin is of
physiologic relevance in the control of cell metabolism in adipose
tissue.

Dixit et al. (2007) reported that ghrelin and ghrelin receptor
expression within the thymus diminished with progressive aging. Infusion
of ghrelin into 14-month-old mice significantly improved age-associated
changes in thymic architecture and thymocyte numbers, increasing recent
thymic emigrants and improving T cell receptor diversity of peripheral T
cell subsets. Ghrelin-induced thymopoiesis during aging was associated
with enhanced early thymocyte progenitors and bone marrow-derived
hematopoietic stem cells, while Ghrl/Ghsr-deficient mice displayed
accelerated age-associated thymic involution. Leptin (164160) also
enhanced thymopoiesis in aged but not young mice.

Jerlhag et al. (2009) provided evidence that the central ghrelin
signaling system is required for alcohol reward. In mice, central
ghrelin administration to brain ventricles, or to tegmental areas
involved in reward, increased voluntary alcohol intake. Central or
peripheral administration of ghrelin receptor antagonists suppressed
alcohol intake. In addition, suppression of central ghrelin signaling
resulted in blunting of alcohol-induced locomotor stimulation, decreased
dopamine release, and impaired conditioned place preference. These
findings indicated that central ghrelin signaling not only stimulates
the reward system, but is also required for stimulation of that system
by alcohol.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
OBESITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
METABOLIC SYNDROME, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
GHRL, ARG51GLN

In 6 of 96 obese (601665) subjects, Ukkola et al. (2001) found a
substitution of gln for arg at codon 51 of preproghrelin (R51Q). This
mutation was caused by a G-to-A transition at codon 346 of the ghrelin
gene, leading to a replacement of arg by gln at the last codon of the
mature ghrelin product, codon 28. This mutation was not found among 96
control subjects. Hinney et al. (2002) found this mutation in similar
frequency among obese and control subjects, however.

In a study examining the relationship between GHRL variants and eating
behavior and risk for metabolic syndrome (see 605552), obesity,
diabetes, and related traits involving 856 Amish participants, Steinle
et al. (2005) found that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was lower
among those carrying the 51Q allele (3.8 vs 15.8%; age- and sex-adjusted
odds ratio = 0.22; P = 0.031).

.0002
OBESITY, AGE AT ONSET OF
METABOLIC SYNDROME, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
GHRL, LEU72MET

Ukkola et al. (2001) found this mutation, a nucleotide 408C-A
transversion resulting in a leu72-to-met (L72M) amino acid change, in 15
obese (601665) (12 heter- and 3 homozygotes) and 12 control subjects.
Among the obese carriers, 12 were heterozygous and 3 homozygous for the
substitution; among the control carriers, all were heterozygotes. This
mutation is outside the coding region for mature ghrelin. The age at
onset of self-reported weight problems tended to be lower among carrier
obese subjects than among those without the polymorphism.

Korbonits et al. (2002) found this SNP (dbSNP rs696217), which they
referred to as SNP247, in heterozygosity in 14 subjects. They noted that
children carrying this polymorphism had a significantly higher Z BMI
compared to those carrying only the wildtype allele, and that the age at
onset of obesity for those carrying this SNP was slightly earlier
(median SNP247 group 2.0 years, wildtype group 3.5 years; P = 0.036).

Hinney et al. (2002) identified this variant in both extremely obese
children and adolescents and normal-weight students.

In a study examining the relationship between GHRL variants and eating
behavior and risk for metabolic syndrome (see 605552), obesity,
diabetes, and related traits involving 856 Amish participants, Steinle
et al. (2005) found that the L72M variant was associated with increased
prevalence of metabolic syndrome (23.2 vs 13.4%; age- and sex-adjusted
odds ratio = 2.57; P = 0.02) as well as higher fasting glucose, lower
high density lipoprotein, and higher triglyceride levels (P = 0.02, P =
0.007, and P = 0.04, respectively).

OBESITY, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
GHRL, GLN90LEU

Hinney et al. (2002) identified a novel variant in the ghrelin gene, an
A-to-T transversion that led to a nonconservative amino acid change from
gln to leu at codon 90 (Q90L; dbSNP rs4684677). The frequency of the
leu90 allele was significantly higher in the extremely obese (601665)
children and adolescents than in the normal-weight students.
Additionally, they genotyped 134 underweight students and 44
normal-weight adults for this SNP. Genotype frequencies were similar in
extremely obese children and adolescents, underweight students, and
normal-weight adults.

.0004
GHRELIN POLYMORPHISM
GHRL, 2-BP DEL, CODON 34

In a healthy normal-weight individual, Hinney et al. (2002) identified a
2-bp deletion at codon 34 of ghrelin leading to the insertion of 36
aberrant amino acids and a stop codon at position 71. This variant
affects the coding region of mature ghrelin; presumably, this individual
is haploinsufficient for ghrelin.

610211	TITLE *610211 SRA STEM LOOP-INTERACTING RNA-BINDING PROTEIN; SLIRP
;;CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 156; C14ORF156
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA, or SRA1; 603819) is a complex RNA
molecule containing multiple stable stem-loop structures that functions
in coactivation of nuclear receptors. SLIRP interacts with stem-loop
structure-7 of SRA (STR7) and modulates nuclear receptor transactivation
(Hatchell et al., 2006).

CLONING

Using STR7 as bait in a yeast 3-hybrid screen of a primary breast cancer
cDNA library, Hatchell et al. (2006) cloned SLIRP. The deduced 109-amino
acid protein contains a putative N-terminal mitochondrial localization
sequence and a central RNA recognition domain with RNP1 and RNP2
submotifs. It has putative sites for N-myristoylation and
phosphorylation. Northern blot analysis detected variable expression of
SLIRP in all tissues examined, with highest levels in heart, liver,
skeletal muscle, and testis. Western blot analysis detected SLIRP at an
apparent molecular mass of 12.7 kD in several human cell lines.
Immunohistochemical analysis of primary breast cancer tissue showed high
SLIRP expression in a punctate cytoplasmic distribution. Expression was
lower in normal ductal tissue, and no expression was detected in the
surrounding stroma. SLIRP colocalized with a mitochondrial marker
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation RT-PCR, Hatchell et al. (2006) found that SRA
copurified with SLIRP in several human cell lines. SLIRP repressed
transactivation by nuclear receptors in an SRA-dependent manner, and
SLIRP function required an intact RRM domain. SLIRP was recruited to
endogenous promoters, augmented the estrogen antagonistic effects of
tamoxifen, modulated association of SRC1 (NCOA1; 602691) with SRA, and
reduced SKIP (SKIIP; 603055)-potentiated nuclear receptor signaling.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hatchell et al. (2006) mapped the SLIRP
gene to chromosome 14q24.3.

604672	TITLE *604672 CD209 ANTIGEN; CD209
;;DENDRITIC CELL-SPECIFIC ICAM3-GRABBING NONINTEGRIN; DCSIGN;;
HIV GP120-BINDING PROTEIN;;
C-TYPE LECTIN DOMAIN FAMILY 4, MEMBER L; CLEC4L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The C-type lectin receptors are involved in the primary interface
between host and pathogens. Two prototypic members of the C-type
lectin-receptor family act as both cell-adhesion receptors and
pathogen-recognition receptors: CD209 and its close relative CD209L
(CLEC4M; 605872) (review by Barreiro et al., 2005).

CLONING

The binding of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope
glycoprotein gp120 to the cell surface receptor CD4 (186940) had been
considered a primary determinant of viral tropism (see 609423). A number
of cell types, however, can be infected by the virus, or bind gp120, in
the absence of CD4 expression. Human placenta had been identified as a
tissue that binds gp120 in a CD4-independent manner. By expression
cloning, Curtis et al. (1992) screened a placenta cDNA library and
isolated a cDNA (clone 11) encoding a gp120-binding protein unrelated to
CD4. The 1.3-kb cDNA predicts a 404-amino acid protein with a calculated
molecular mass of 45,775 Da. The gp120-binding protein is organized into
3 domains: an N-terminal cytoplasmic and hydrophobic region, a set of
tandem repeats (7 complete and 1 incomplete), and a C-terminal domain
with homology to C-type (calcium-dependent) lectins. A type II membrane
orientation (N-terminal cytoplasmic) was predicted both by the cDNA
sequence and by the reactivity of C-terminal peptide-specific antiserum
with the surface of clone 11-transfected cells. Native and recombinant
gp120 and whole virus bound transfected cells. Gp120 binding was high
affinity (Kd, 1.3 to 1.6 nM) and was inhibited by mannan, D-mannose, and
L-fucose; once bound, gp120 was internalized rapidly. These data
demonstrated that the gp120-binding protein is a membrane-associated
mannose-binding lectin. Curtis et al. (1992) suggested that proteins of
this type may play an important role in the CD4-independent association
of HIV with cells.

Contact between dendritic cells (DCs) and resting T cells is essential
to initiate a primary immune response. Geijtenbeek et al. (2000)
demonstrated that intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM3; 146631)
expressed by resting T cells is important in this first contact with
DCs. They discovered that instead of the common ICAM3 receptors LFA1
(see 153370) and alpha-D-beta-2, a novel DC-specific C-type lectin,
which they called DCSIGN (DC-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin), binds
ICAM3 with high affinity. DCSIGN is a type II transmembrane protein
consisting of 404 amino acids with 3 distinct domains. The 40-amino acid
N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is separated by a hydrophobic stretch of
15 amino acids from a region consisting of 1 incomplete and 7 complete
tandem repeats of nearly identical sequence. The extracellular
C-terminal region (cys253 to ala404) shows homology to C-type lectins.
Sequence analysis revealed that DCSIGN is identical to the HIV-1
gp120-binding protein described by Curtis et al. (1992). DCSIGN, which
is abundantly expressed by DCs both in vitro and in vivo, mediates
transient adhesion with T cells. Since antibodies against DCSIGN
inhibited DC-induced proliferation of resting T cells, these findings
predicted that DCSIGN enables T-cell receptor engagement by
stabilization of the DC/T-cell contact zone.

Soilleux et al. (2000) also cloned CD209. They noted that CD209 has
dileucine and YXXL internalization motifs in its cytoplasmic tail. It
also contains extracellular carbohydrate recognition domains, which are
involved in calcium-dependent mannose binding, that are encoded by 3
separate exons, a structure also found in CD23 (151445). RT-PCR analysis
detected CD209 expression in placenta and, at lower levels, in
endometrium and a DC line.

GENE FUNCTION

DCs capture microorganisms that enter peripheral mucosal tissues, and
then migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, where they present these in
antigenic form to resting T cells, thus initiating adaptive immune
responses. Geijtenbeek et al. (2000) described the properties of DCSIGN,
which is highly expressed on DCs present in mucosal tissues and binds to
the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. DCSIGN does not function as a
receptor for viral entry into DCs but instead promotes efficient
infection in trans of cells that express CD4 and chemokine receptors.
Geijtenbeek et al. (2000) proposed that DCSIGN efficiently captures
HIV-1 in the periphery and facilitates its transport to secondary
lymphoid organs rich in T cells, to enhance infection in trans of these
target cells.

Dengue virus (DV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that primarily targets
DCs and causes hemorrhagic fever in humans (see 614371). Navarro-Sanchez
et al. (2003) found that anti-DCSIGN and the soluble tetrameric
ectodomain of DCSIGN inhibited DV infection. The data indicated that
DCSIGN functions as a DV-binding lectin that interacts as an attachment
factor with the DV envelope glycoprotein.

Using primary DCs naturally expressing DCSIGN and cell lines transfected
with DCSIGN or its liver/lymph node-specific homolog, LSIGN (CD209L;
605872), Tassaneetrithep et al. (2003) showed that extensive infection
by all 4 DV serotypes was dependent on expression of these lectins.
Fluorescence microscopy indicated that DV infection could be blocked by
antibody to DCSIGN but not by antibodies to other molecules expressed on
DCs. Mutation analysis indicated that the cytoplasmic domain of DCSIGN
enhanced but was not essential for infection. Because of the wide array
of pathogens whose infectivity is DCSIGN-dependent, Tassaneetrithep et
al. (2003) proposed that DCSIGN recognizes pathogen-associated microbial
patterns, or PAMPs.

Geijtenbeek et al. (2003) found that DCSIGN captured and internalized
intact Mycobacterium bovis BCG or avirulent M. tuberculosis (see 607948)
through the glycolipid mycobacterial cell wall component ManLAM. Both
bacilli and ManLAM were targeted to lysosomes and colocalized with LAMP1
(153330) in immature DCs. Antibodies against DCSIGN blocked BCG
infection of DCs. Binding of secreted ManLAM to DCSIGN prevented
mycobacteria- or LPS-induced DC maturation and induced IL10 (124092)
production, suggesting that DCSIGN-ManLAM interaction may interfere with
TLR-mediated signaling and development of an antiinflammatory response.
Geijtenbeek et al. (2003) proposed that M. tuberculosis may target
DCSIGN both to infect DCs and to downregulate DC-mediated immune
responses.

Tailleux et al. (2003) showed that M. tuberculosis entered DCs after
binding to DCSIGN, whereas the major macrophage receptors for M.
tuberculosis, CR3 (see ITGAM; 120980) and MRC1 (153618), played only a
minor role in DC infection. Flow cytometric and histopathologic analyses
showed expression of DCSIGN on lung DCs from uninfected patients and on
lymph node granuloma cells infected with M. tuberculosis.

Using flow cytometric analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from
tuberculosis (TB), asthma, and sarcoidosis patients and control
individuals, Tailleux et al. (2005) found that most alveolar macrophages
from TB patients expressed DCSIGN, whereas the lectin was barely
detected in cells from the other subjects. FACS, RT-PCR, and ELISA
analyses indicated that M. tuberculosis infection induced DCSIGN
expression by a mechanism independent of TLR4 (603030), IL4 (147780),
and IL13 (147683). Immunohistochemical analysis showed bacillary
concentration in lung regions enriched in DCSIGN-expressing alveolar
macrophages. Binding experiments revealed that DCSIGN-expressing
alveolar macrophages were preferential targets for M. tuberculosis
compared with DCSIGN-negative cells. Tailleux et al. (2005) did not
detect IL10 in bronchoalveolar lavage or induction of IL10 in infected
cells.

The 2 lectin-coding genes CD209 and CD209L resulted from a duplication
of an ancestral gene (Bashirova et al., 2003; Soilleux, 2003). An
additional characteristic of both CD209 and CD209L is the presence of a
neck region, primarily made up of 7 highly conserved 23-amino acid
repeats, that separates the carbohydrate-recognition domain involved in
pathogen binding from the transmembrane domain. This neck region
presents high nucleotide identity between repeats, both within each
molecule and between CD209 and CD209L. This region plays a crucial role
in the oligomerization and support of the carbohydrate-recognition
domain; therefore, it influences the pathogen-binding properties of
these 2 receptors (Barreiro et al., 2005). CD209 is expressed primarily
on phagocytic cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages, whereas
CD209L expression is restricted to endothelial cells in liver and lymph
nodes.

By challenging DCs with different phleboviruses, including Rift Valley
fever and Uukuniemi viruses, in the presence or absence of antibody to
DCSIGN, Lozach et al. (2011) demonstrated that DCSIGN was required for
DC infection. Cells lacking DCSIGN resisted phlebovirus challenge, but
they became susceptible when transfected with DCSIGN. Binding by DCSIGN,
which was followed by virus internalization and infection, occurred via
interactions with high-mannose N-glycans on viral glycoproteins.
Mutation of DCSIGN to ablate endocytosis prevented infection. Lozach et
al. (2011) concluded that DCSIGN is a phlebovirus entry receptor.

Lefevre et al. (2013) observed increased mRNA and protein expression for
the C-lectin receptors dectin-1 (CLEC7A; 606264), Mr (MRC1), and Signr3,
a mouse homolog of CD209, in mice infected with Leishmania infantum (Li)
(see 608207). Mice lacking dectin-1 or Mr, but not those lacking Signr3,
had higher parasite levels in blood and spleen. Peritoneal macrophages
from dectin-1 -/- or Mrc1 -/- mice, but not Signr3 -/- mice, permitted
Li growth and exhibited poor production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). ROS production required dectin-1-Syk (600085)-p47-phox (NCF1;
608512) phosphorylation and Mr-arachidonic acid-Nadph oxidase (NOX1;
300225) membrane translocation. Dectin-1 and Mr facilitated release of
Il1b (147720) induced by Casp1 (147678) in response to Li infection,
whereas Il1b was downregulated by Signr3 through Lta4h (151570). In
human macrophages, small interfering RNA-mediated inactivation of CLEC7A
and MRC1, but not CD209, resulted in responses to Li similar to those
observed in mice. Lefevre et al. (2013) concluded that
Leishmania-macrophage interaction is influenced by the stage of
macrophage polarization (i.e., by cytokine and stimulatory milieu) and
by members of the C-lectin receptor family. They proposed that
alteration of these cellular and molecular factors may benefit patient
responses.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Feinberg et al. (2001) generated crystal structures of DCSIGN and
DCSIGNR and showed that the carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) of
both are specific for high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharides, such as
those present on the envelope of HIV-1. One monomer of the DCSIGN pair
of CRDs interacts with the terminal N-acetylglucosamine of GlcNAc1,
while the partner monomer of DCSIGNR is bound to Ca+. Feinberg et al.
(2001) proposed that the mechanistic basis of DCSIGN- and
DCSIGNR-oligosaccharide interaction provides a starting point to the
design of both therapeutic and prophylactic attacks on HIV-1 infection.

Using cryoelectron microscopy, Pokidysheva et al. (2006) determined the
structure of DV serotype-2 (DV2) in complex with the CRD of human DCSIGN
at 25-angstrom resolution. The structure showed that 1 CRD monomer binds
to 2 glycosylation sites at asn67 of 2 neighboring DV envelope
glycoproteins in each icosahedral asymmetric unit. The vacancy at the
third asn67 site leaves space for primary DV receptor binding to domain
III of the envelope protein. Pokidysheva et al. (2006) suggested that
the use of carbohydrate moieties for receptor binding sites may be a
mechanism for avoiding immune surveillance.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Soilleux et al. (2000) determined that the
CD209 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

Soilleux et al. (2000) mapped the CD209 gene to 19p13.3, in a cluster
with the CD209L (605872) and CD23 genes, by radiation hybrid analysis.

The lectin-coding genes CD209 and CD209L, which resulted from a
duplication of an ancestral gene, are located within a segment of
approximately 26 kb (Barreiro et al., 2005).

EVOLUTION

The innate immunity system constitutes the first line of host defense
against pathogens. Two closely related innate immunity genes, CD209 and
CD209L, directly recognize a cluster of pathogens, including bacteria,
viruses, and parasites. To explore the extent to which pathogens have
exerted selective pressure on these innate immunity genes, Barreiro et
al. (2005) resequenced them in a group of samples from sub-Saharan
Africa, Europe, and East Asia. Moreover, variation in the number of
repeats in the neck region was defined in the entire Human Genome
Diversity Panel for both genes. The results, which were based on
diversity levels, neutrality tests, population genetic distances, and
neck-region length variation, provided genetic evidence that CD209 has
been under a strong selective constraint that prevents accumulation of
any amino acid changes, whereas CD209L variability has most likely been
shaped by the action of balancing selection in non-African populations.
In addition, the data pointed to the neck region as the functional
target of such selective pressures: CD209 presented a constant size in
the neck region populationwide, whereas CD209L presented an excess of
length variation, particularly in non-African populations. An additional
interesting observation came from the coalescent-based CD209 gene tree,
whose binary typology and time depth (approximately 2.8 million years
ago) were compatible with an ancestral population structure in Africa.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Martin et al. (2004) found that European Americans at risk for
parenteral HIV infection were more likely to carry the -336C SNP than
the -336T SNP (604672.0001) in the promoter of DCSIGN. This association
was not observed in those at risk for mucosally acquired infection.
Although the -336C SNP was common in African Americans, no significant
association with risk of infection was observed in this group.

Sakuntabhai et al. (2005) found that the same CD209 promoter
polymorphism reported by Martin et al. (2004), which Sakuntabhai et al.
(2005) called -336A-G, was associated with severity of dengue disease
(614371). Specifically, the G allele of the variant was associated with
strong protection against dengue fever as opposed to dengue hemorrhagic
fever. These results indicated that CD209 has a crucial role in dengue
pathogenesis, which discriminates between severe dengue fever and dengue
hemorrhagic fever.

Barreiro et al. (2006) examined CD209 polymorphisms in 351 TB patients
and 360 healthy controls from a South African Coloured population
(historically derived from Khoisan, Malaysian, Bantu, and European
descent populations) living in communities with some of the highest
reported incidence rates of TB in the world. They identified 2 CD209
promoter variants, -871A (604672.0002) and -336G, that were associated
with increased risk of TB. One haplotype of 8 SNPs, including -871G and
-336A, showed a highly significant association with the control group.
Further analysis of sub-Saharan African, European, and Asian populations
showed that the protective -336A and -871G alleles were present at
higher frequencies in Eurasians than in Africans. Barreiro et al. (2006)
suggested that the longer and more intense duration of TB exposure in
Europe may have exerted stronger selective pressures in this population
and may have had an impact on susceptibility to infection by other
pathogens, such as HIV and dengue.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using a mouse model of food allergy, Zhou et al. (2010) found that mice
pretreated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) with 51 molecules of
mannoside (Man51-BSA) plus cholera toxin via oral delivery exhibited
reduced BSA-induced anaphylaxis compared with mice pretreated with BSA
plus cholera toxin. Man51-BSA selectively targeted lamina propria DCs
(LPDCs) expressing Signr1, a mouse homolog of CD209 and CLEC4M, and
induced Il10, but not Il6 (147620) or Il12 p70 (see 161560). Man51-BSA
induced the same effects in Il10-GFP knockin (tiger) mice. Interaction
of Man51-BSA with Signr1 resulted in the generation of Cd4-positive
type-1 regulatory-like (Tr1-like) cells that expressed Il10 and Ifng
(147570) in a Signr1- and Il10-dependent manner, but not
Cd4-positive/Cd25 (IL2RA; 147730)-positive/Foxp3 (300292)-positive
regulatory T cells. Tolerance could be transferred by the Tr1-like
cells. Zhou et al. (2010) proposed that sugar-modified antigens may be
useful in inducing tolerance by targeting Signr1 homologs and LPDCs.

To characterize the immunologic response associated with intravenous
immunoglobulin administration, Anthony et al. (2011) generated humanized
DCSIGN mice (hDCSIGN), and demonstrated that the antiinflammatory
activity of intravenous immunoglobulin can be recapitulated by transfer
into naive recipients of bone marrow-derived DCSIGN+ macrophages or
dendritic cells treated with IgG crystallizable fragments (Fc) that
contain glycans terminating in alpha-2,6 sialic acids (sFc).
Furthermore, sFc administration resulted in the production of IL33
(608678), which, in turn, induced expansion of IL4 (147780)-producing
basophils that promote increased expression of the inhibitory Fc
receptor Fc-gamma-RIIB (604590) on effector macrophages. Systemic
administration of the TH2 cytokines IL33 or IL4 upregulated
Fc-gamma-RIIB on macrophages and suppressed serum-induced arthritis.
Consistent with these results, transfer of IL33-treated basophils
suppressed induced arthritic inflammation. Anthony et al. (2011)
suggested that this novel DCSIGN-TH2 pathway initiated by an endogenous
ligand, sFc, provides an intrinsic mechanism for maintaining immune
homeostasis that could be manipulated to provide therapeutic benefit in
autoimmune diseases.

Martin et al. (2004) found that European Americans at risk for
parenteral HIV infection (see 609423) were more likely to carry the
-336C SNP than the -336T SNP in the promoter of DCSIGN. This association
was not observed in those at risk for mucosally acquired infection.
Although the -336C SNP was common in African Americans, no significant
association with risk of infection was observed in this group.

Sakuntabhai et al. (2005) reported strong association between the
-336A-G polymorphism in the promoter of CD209, which they called
DCSIGN1-336, and risk of dengue fever (614371). The G allele of the
variant was associated with strong protection against dengue fever in 3
independent cohorts from Thailand, with a carrier frequency of 4.7% in
individuals with dengue fever compared with 22.4% in individuals with
dengue hemorrhagic fever (odds ratio for risk of dengue hemorrhagic
fever vs dengue fever = 5.84) and 19.5% in controls (odds ratio for
protection = 4.90). This variant affects an Sp1-like binding site and
transcriptional activity in vitro. Carrington (2006) confirmed that the
-336T-C SNP reported by Martin et al. (2004) and the -336A-G SNP
reported by Sakuntabhai et al. (2005) are the same variant.

Barreiro et al. (2006) found an association between susceptibility to
tuberculosis (607948) and -336G in a South African Coloured population.

102578	TITLE *102578 ACUTE PROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA, INDUCER OF; PML
;;MYL
PML/RARA FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PML tumor suppressor protein is essential for the formation of a
dynamic macromolecular nuclear structure called the PML-nuclear body
(PML-NB). PML-NBs have also been referred to as nuclear domains-10,
Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. Unlike more specialized
subnuclear structures, PML-NBs are involved in diverse cellular
functions, including sequestration and release of proteins, mediation of
posttranslational modifications, and promotion of nuclear events in
response to various cellular stresses. The PML gene is involved in the
t(15;17) translocation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; 612376),
which generates the oncogenic fusion protein PML-retinoic acid
receptor-alpha (RARA; 180240). PML-NBs are disrupted in APL and are thus
implicated in APL pathogenesis (Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007; Salomoni et
al., 2008).

CLONING

In the process of analyzing the RARA gene in the t(15;17)(q22;q11.2-q12)
translocation specifically associated with APL, de The et al. (1990)
identified a novel gene on chromosome 15 involved with the RARA gene in
formation of a fusion product. This gene, which they called MYL for
'myelocytic leukemia,' was transcribed in the same direction as RARA on
the translocated chromosome. De The et al. (1990) identified a 144-bp
region, flanked by canonical splice acceptor and donor sequences, that
had a high probability of being an exon and showed no significant
similarity to any sequence in a protein data bank, thus suggesting that
MYL is a previously undescribed gene. In a later report, de The et al.
(1991) changed the name of the gene from MYL to PML. They reported,
furthermore, that the gene product contains a novel zinc finger motif
common to several DNA-binding proteins.

Goddard et al. (1991) demonstrated that PML is a putative zinc finger
protein and potential transcription factor that is commonly expressed,
with at least 3 major transcription products.

Goddard et al. (1995) cloned the murine Pml gene. The predicted amino
acid sequence of mouse Pml, a ring-finger protein, shows 80% similarity
to that of the human homolog, with greater than 90% similarity in the
proposed functional domains.

MAPPING

The PML gene maps to chromosome 15q22 (de The et al., 1990).

Goddard et al. (1995) mapped the mouse Pml gene to a region of
chromosome 9 with known homology of synteny to the region of 15q where
PML is located.

GENE FUNCTION

While PML does not colocalize with proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA; 176740) or spliceosomes, Dyck et al. (1994) showed that it is
part of a macromolecular structure, composed of at least 4 nuclear
proteins, that is adhered to the nuclear matrix. This structure shows a
labeling pattern resembling spheres that vary in both size and number
among individual cells of a given cell line. PML-RAR expression appears
to disrupt the integrity of these structures (referred to by Dyck et al.
(1994) as PML oncogenic domains, or PODs) and thus appears to be the
possible cause of their altered morphology. Retinoid treatment leads to
a striking reassembly of the POD, which in turn is linked to
differentiation of the leukemic cells. These results identified a novel
macromolecular nuclear structure and suggested that it may serve as a
target of cellular transformation.

From their analysis of the phosphoamino acids of the PML protein, Chang
et al. (1995) concluded that both tyrosine and serine residues are
phosphorylated. To investigate whether expression of the PML protein is
cell cycle related, HeLa cells synchronized at various phases of the
cell cycle were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and confocal
microscopy. They found that PML was expressed at a lower level in S, G2,
and M phases and at a significantly higher level in G1 phase. Other
studies showed that PML is a phosphoprotein and is associated with the
nuclear matrix. Chang et al. (1995) noted that PML shares many
properties with tumor suppressors such as RB (614041).

Fusion of PML and TIF1A (603406) to RARA and BRAF (164757),
respectively, results in the production of PML-RAR-alpha and
TIF1-alpha-B-RAF (T18) oncoproteins. Zhong et al. (1999) showed that
PML, TIF1-alpha, and RXR-alpha (180245)/RAR-alpha function together in a
retinoic acid-dependent transcription complex. Zhong et al. (1999) found
that PML acts as a ligand-dependent coactivator of RXR-alpha/RARA-alpha.
PML interacts with TIF1-alpha and CREB-binding protein (CBP; 600140). In
PML -/- cells, the retinoic acid-dependent induction of genes such as
RARB2, and the ability of TIF1-alpha and CBP to act as transcriptional
coactivators on retinoic acid, are impaired. Zhong et al. (1999) showed
that both PML and TIF1-alpha are growth suppressors required for the
growth-inhibitory activity of retinoic acid. T18, similar to
PML-RAR-alpha, disrupts the retinoic acid-dependent activity of this
complex in a dominant-negative manner, resulting in a growth advantage.
PML-RAR-alpha was the first example of an oncoprotein generated by the
fusion of 2 molecules participating in the same pathway, specifically
the fusion of a transcription factor to one of its own cofactors. Since
the PML and RAR-alpha pathways converge at the transcriptional level,
there is no need for a double-dominant-negative product to explain the
pathogenesis of APL.

Pearson et al. (2000) reported that the tumor suppressor PML regulates
the p53 response to oncogenic signals. Pearson et al. (2000) found that
oncogenic RAS (190020) upregulates PML expression, and that
overexpression of PML induces senescence in a p53-dependent manner. p53
is acetylated at lysine-382 upon RAS expression, an event that is
essential for its biologic function. RAS induces relocalization of p53
and the CBP acetyltransferase within the PML nuclear bodies and induces
the formation of a trimeric p53-PML-CBP complex. Lastly, RAS-induced p53
acetylation, p53-CBP complex stabilization, and senescence are lost in
PML -/- fibroblasts. Pearson et al. (2000) concluded that their data
established a link between PML and p53 and indicated that integrity of
the PML bodies is required for p53 acetylation and senescence upon
oncogene expression.

Khan et al. (2001) showed that PML interacts with multiple corepressors
(SKI (164780), NCOR, and Sin3A (607776)) and histone deacetylase-1
(HDAC1; 601241), and that this interaction is required for
transcriptional repression mediated by the tumor suppressor MAD
(600021). PML-RARA has the 2 corepressor-interacting sites and inhibits
MAD-mediated repression, suggesting that aberrant binding of PML-RARA to
the corepressor complexes may lead to abrogation of the corepressor
function. The authors suggested that these mechanisms may contribute to
events leading to leukemogenesis.

Turelli et al. (2001) showed that incoming retroviral preintegration
complexes trigger the exportin (602559)-mediated cytoplasmic export of
the SWI/SNF component INI1 (601607) and of the nuclear body constituent
PML. They further showed that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
genome associates with these proteins before nuclear migration. In the
presence of arsenic, PML was sequestered in the nucleus, and the
efficiency of HIV-mediated transduction was markedly increased. These
results unveiled an unsuspected cellular response that interferes with
the early steps of HIV replication.

Yang et al. (2002) determined that PML and checkpoint kinase-2 (CHEK2;
604373) mediated p53 (191170)-independent apoptosis following gamma
irradiation of several human cell lines. Endogenous CHEK2 bound PML
within PML nuclear bodies. Following gamma irradiation, CHEK2
phosphorylated PML on ser117, causing dissociation of the 2 proteins.
Apoptosis through this mechanism also required ATM (208900). Yang et al.
(2002) concluded that this pathway to gamma irradiation-induced
apoptosis utilizes ATM, CHEK2, and PML. Overexpression of PML alone
caused apoptosis in U937 myeloid cells.

Lin et al. (2004) demonstrated that cytoplasmic PML is an essential
modulator of TGF-beta signaling. Primary cells from Pml-null mice are
resistant to TGF-beta-dependent growth arrest, induction of cellular
senescence, and apoptosis. These cells also have impaired
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the TGF-beta signaling
proteins Smad2 (601366) and Smad3 (603109), as well as impaired
induction of TGF-beta target genes. Expression of cytoplasmic Pml is
induced by TGF-beta. Furthermore, cytoplasmic Pml physically interacts
with Smad2, Smad3, and SMAD anchor for receptor activation (SARA;
603755), and is required for association of Smad2 and Smad3 with Sara
and for the accumulation of Sara and TGF-beta receptor (see 190181) in
the early endosome. The PML-RAR-alpha oncoprotein of acute promyelocytic
leukemia can antagonize cytoplasmic PML function, and acute
promyelocytic leukemia cells have defects in TGF-beta signaling similar
to those observed in Pml-null cells. Lin et al. (2004) concluded that
their findings identified cytoplasmic PML as a critical TGF-beta
receptor and further implicated deregulated TGF-beta signaling in cancer
pathogenesis.

Trotman et al. (2006) demonstrated that the PML tumor suppressor
prevents cancer by inactivating phosphorylated AKT (164730) inside the
nucleus. They found in a mouse model that Pml loss markedly accelerated
tumor onset, incidence, and progression in Pten (601728) heterozygous
mutants, and led to female sterility with features that recapitulate the
phenotype of Foxo3a knockout mice. Trotman et al. (2006) showed that PML
deficiency on its own leads to tumorigenesis in the prostate, a tissue
that is exquisitely sensitive to phosphorylated AKT levels, and
demonstrated that PML specifically recruits the AKT phosphatase PP2a
(see 603113) as well phosphorylated AKT into PML nuclear bodies.
Notably, Trotman et al. (2006) found that PML-null cells are impaired in
PP2a phosphatase activity towards AKT, and thus accumulate nuclear
phosphorylated AKT. As a consequence, the progressive reduction in PML
dose leads to inactivation of FOXO3A-mediated transcription of
proapoptotic BIM (603827) and the cell cycle inhibitor p27(KIP1)
(600778). Trotman et al. (2006) concluded that their results demonstrate
that PML orchestrates a nuclear tumor suppressor network for
inactivation of nuclear phosphorylated AKT, and thus highlight the
importance of AKT compartmentalization in human cancer pathogenesis and
treatment.

Bernardi et al. (2006) identified PML as a critical inhibitor of
neoangiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) in vivo, in both
ischemic and neoplastic conditions, through the control of protein
translation. Bernardi et al. (2006) demonstrated that in hypoxic
conditions PML acts as a negative regulator of the synthesis rate of
hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A; 603348) by repressing MTOR
(601231). PML physically interacts with MTOR and negatively regulates
its association with the small GTPase RHEB (601293) by favoring MTOR
nuclear accumulation. Notably, PML-null cells and tumors display higher
sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo to growth inhibition by rapamycin,
and lack of PML inversely correlates with phosphorylation of ribosomal
protein S6 (180460) and tumor angiogenesis in mouse and human tumors.
Thus, Bernardi et al. (2006) concluded that their findings identified
PML as a novel suppressor of mTOR and neoangiogenesis.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of a human fetal brain cDNA library, followed
by coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Kunapuli et al. (2006) found that
ZNF198 (ZMYM2; 602221) was covalently modified by SUMO1 (601912).
Confocal microscopy showed that a proportion of ZNF198 colocalized with
SUMO1 and PML in PML nuclear bodies, and coimmunoprecipitation analysis
revealed that all 3 proteins resided in a protein complex. Mutation of
the SUMO1-binding site of ZNF198 resulted in degradation of ZNF198,
nuclear dispersal of PML, and loss of punctate PML nuclear bodies.
Kunapuli et al. (2006) found that the MDA-MB-157 breast cancer cell
line, which has a deletion in chromosome 13q11 encompassing the ZNF198
gene, lacked PML nuclear bodies, although PML protein levels appeared
normal. The fusion protein ZNF198/FGFR1 (136350), which occurs in
atypical myeloproliferative disease (613523) and lacks the SUMO1-binding
site of ZNF198, could dimerize with wildtype ZNF198 and disrupt its
function. Expression of ZNF198/FGFR1 disrupted PML sumoylation and
nuclear body formation and resulted in cytoplasmic localization of
SUMO1. Kunapuli et al. (2006) concluded that sumoylation of ZNF198 is
required for PML nuclear body formation.

Ito et al. (2008) showed that PML is critical in the maintenance of
quiescent leukemia-initiating cells and normal hematopoietic stem cells.
They suggested that targeting PML may be an effective treatment for
prevention of relapse in CML (608232).

Song et al. (2008) found that PTEN was aberrantly localized in APL in
which PML function was disrupted by the PML-RARA fusion oncoprotein.
Treatment with drugs that triggered PML-RARA degradation restored
nuclear PTEN. PML opposed the activity of HAUSP (USP7; 602519) towards
PTEN through a mechanism involving DAXX (603186). Confocal microscopy
and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that HAUSP was overexpressed in
prostate cancer and that levels of HAUSP directly correlated with tumor
aggressiveness and with PTEN nuclear exclusion. Song et al. (2008)
concluded that a PML-HAUSP network controls PTEN deubiquitinylation and
subcellular localization, which is perturbed in human cancers.

Arsenic, an ancient drug used in traditional Chinese medicine, has
attracted worldwide interest because it shows substantial anticancer
activity in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Arsenic
trioxide exerts its therapeutic effect by promoting degradation of
PML-RARA. PML and PML-RARA degradation is triggered by their
sumoylation, but the mechanism by which arsenic trioxide induces this
posttranslational modification was unclear. Zhang et al. (2010) showed
that arsenic binds directly to cysteine residues in zinc fingers located
within the RBCC domain of PML-RARA and PML. Arsenic binding induces PML
oligomerization, which increases its interaction with the small
ubiquitin-like protein modifier (SUMO)-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (601661),
resulting in enhanced sumoylation and degradation. Zhang et al. (2010)
concluded that the identification of PML as a direct target of arsenic
trioxide provides insights into the drug's mechanism of action and its
specificity for APL.

In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Giorgi et al. (2010) found that
extranuclear Pml was specifically enriched at the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and at the mitochondria-associated membranes, signaling domains
involved in ER-to-mitochondria calcium ion transport and in induction of
apoptosis. They found Pml in complexes of large molecular size with the
inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R; 147265), protein kinase Akt
(164730), and protein phosphatase 2a (176915). Pml was essential for
Akt- and PP2a-dependent modulation of Ip3r phosphorylation and in turn
for Ip3r-mediated calcium ion release from the endoplasmic reticulum.
Giorgi et al. (2010) concluded that their findings provided a
mechanistic explanation for the pleiotropic role of Pml in apoptosis.

- PML/RARA Fusion Protein

For information on the generation of PML/RARA fusion genes through
translocations associated with APL, see CYTOGENETICS.

Grignani et al. (1993) expressed the PML-RARA protein in U937 myeloid
precursor cells and showed that they lost the capacity to differentiate
under the action of stimuli such as vitamin D3 and transforming growth
factor beta-1 (TGFB1; 190180), acquired enhanced sensitivity to retinoic
acid, and exhibited a higher growth rate consequent to diminished
apoptotic cell death. These results provided evidence of biologic
activity of the fusion protein and recapitulated critical features of
the promyelocytic leukemia phenotype.

Lin et al. (1998) reported that the association of PLZF-RAR-alpha (see
176797) and PML-RAR-alpha with the histone deacetylase complex (see
605164) helps to determine both the development of APL and the ability
of patients to respond to retinoids. Consistent with these observations,
inhibitors of histone deacetylase dramatically potentiate
retinoid-induced differentiation of retinoic acid-sensitive, and restore
retinoid responses of retinoic acid-resistant, APL cell lines. Lin et
al. (1998) concluded that oncogenic retinoic acid receptors mediate
leukemogenesis through aberrant chromatin acetylation, and that
pharmacologic manipulation of nuclear receptor cofactors may be a useful
approach in the treatment of human disease.

Grignani et al. (1998) demonstrated that both PML-RAR-alpha and
PLZF-RAR-alpha fusion proteins recruit the nuclear corepressor (NCOR;
see 600849)-histone deacetylase complex through the RAR-alpha CoR box.
PLZF-RAR-alpha contains a second, retinoic acid-resistant binding site
in the PLZF amino-terminal region. High doses of retinoic acid release
histone deacetylase activity from PML-RAR-alpha, but not from
PLZF-RAR-alpha. Mutation of the NCOR binding site abolishes the ability
of PML-RAR-alpha to block differentiation, whereas inhibition of histone
deacetylase activity switches the transcriptional and biologic effects
of PLZF-RAR-alpha from being an inhibitor to an activator of the
retinoic acid signaling pathway. Therefore, Grignani et al. (1998)
concluded that recruitment of histone deacetylase is crucial to the
transforming potential of APL fusion proteins, and the different effects
of retinoic acid on the stability of the PML-RAR-alpha and
PLZF-RAR-alpha corepressor complexes determines the differential
response of APLs to retinoic acid.

RAR and acute myeloid leukemia-1 (AML1; 151385) transcription factors
are found in leukemias as fusion proteins with PML and ETO (CBFA2T1;
133435), respectively. Association of PML-RAR and AML1-ETO with the
NCOR-histone deacetylase complex is required to block hematopoietic
differentiation. Minucci et al. (2000) showed that PML-RAR and AML1-ETO
exist in vivo within high molecular weight nuclear complexes, reflecting
their oligomeric state. Oligomerization requires PML or ETO coiled-coil
regions and is responsible for abnormal recruitment of NCOR,
transcriptional repression, and impaired differentiation of primary
hematopoietic precursors. Fusion of RAR to a heterologous
oligomerization domain recapitulated the properties of PML-RAR,
indicating that oligomerization per se is sufficient to achieve
transforming potential. These results showed that oligomerization of a
transcription factor, imposing an altered interaction with
transcriptional coregulators, represents a novel mechanism of oncogenic
activation.

The recruitment of the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (NCOR2; 600848)
and subsequent repression of retinoid target genes is critical for the
oncogenic function of PML-RARA. Lin and Evans (2000) showed that the
ability of PML-RARA to form homodimers is both necessary and sufficient
for its increased binding efficiency to corepressor and its inhibitory
effects on hormonal responses in myeloid differentiation. Furthermore,
the authors found that altered stoichiometric interaction of SMRT with
PML-RARA homodimers may underlie these processes. An RXR mutant lacking
transactivation function AF2 recapitulated many biochemical and
functional properties of PML-RARA. Taken together, these results
indicated that altered dimerization of a transcription factor can be
directly linked to cellular transformation, and they implicated
dimerization interfaces of oncogenes as potential drug targets.

Pandolfi (2001) reviewed the roles of the RARA and PML genes in the
pathogenesis of APL and discussed the multiple oncogenic activities of
PML-RARA.

Di Croce et al. (2002) demonstrated that PML-RARA fusion protein induces
gene hypermethylation and silencing by recruiting DNA methyltransferases
to target promoters and that hypermethylation contributes to its
leukemogenic potential. Retinoic acid treatment induces promoter
demethylation, gene reexpression, and reversion of the transformed
phenotype. Di Croce et al. (2002) concluded that their results establish
a mechanistic link between genetic and epigenetic changes during
transformation and suggest that hypermethylation contributes to the
early steps of carcinogenesis.

The fusion protein PML-RARA initiates APL when expressed in the early
myeloid compartment of transgenic mice. Lane and Ley (2003) found that
PML-RARA was cleaved in several positions by a neutral serine protease
in a human myeloid cell line; purification revealed that the protease
was neutrophil elastase (ELA2; 130130). Immunofluorescence localization
studies suggested that cleavage of PML-RARA must have occurred within
the cell, perhaps within the nucleus. The functional importance of ELA2
for APL development was assessed in Ela2-deficient mice. More than 90%
of bone marrow PML-RARA-cleaving activity was lost in the absence of
Ela2, and Ela2-deficient animals, but not cathepsin G (116830)-deficient
animals, were protected from APL development. The authors determined
that primary mouse and human APL cells also contained ELA2-dependent
PML-RARA-cleaving activity. Lane and Ley (2003) concluded that, since
ELA2 is maximally produced in promyelocytes, it may play a role in APL
pathogenesis by facilitating the leukemogenic potential of PML-RARA.

Villa et al. (2006) found that MBD1 (156535) cooperated with PML-RARA in
transcriptional repression and cellular transformation in human cell
lines. PML-RARA recruited MBD1 to its target promoter through an HDAC3
(605166)-mediated mechanism. Binding of HDAC3 and MBD1 was not confined
to the target promoter, but was instead spread over the locus. Knockdown
of HDAC3 expression by RNA interference in acute promyelocytic leukemia
cells alleviated PML-RARA-induced promoter silencing. Furthermore,
retroviral expression of dominant-negative mutants of MBD1 in human
hematopoietic precursors interfered with PML-RARA-induced repression and
restored cell differentiation. Villa et al. (2006) concluded that
PML-RARA recruits an HDAC3-MBD1 complex to target promoters to establish
and maintain chromatin silencing.

CYTOGENETICS

- PML/RARA Fusion Gene

In the process of analyzing the RARA gene in the t(15;17)(q22;q11.2-q12)
translocation specifically associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL), de The et al. (1990) identified a novel gene on chromosome 15
involved with the RARA gene in formation of a fusion product. This gene,
which they called MYL, was transcribed in the same direction as RARA on
the translocated chromosome. In the chimeric gene, the promoter and
first exon of the RARA gene were replaced by part of the MYL gene. De
The et al. (1990) established that the translocation chromosome
generates an MYL-RARA chimeric transcript. The findings strongly
implicated RARA in leukemogenesis. The possibility was raised that the
altered retinoic acid receptor behaves as a dominant-negative mutant
that blocks the expression of retinoic acid target genes involved in
granulocytic differentiation. In a later report, de The et al. (1991)
changed the name of the gene from MYL to PML. The PML-RARA mRNA encoded
a predicted 106-kD chimeric protein containing most of the PML sequences
fused to a large part of the RARA gene, including its DNA- and
hormone-binding domains.

Goddard et al. (1991) determined that the PML breakpoints were clustered
in 2 regions on either side of an alternatively spliced exon. Although
leukemic cells with translocations characteristically expressed only 1
fusion product, both PML-RARA (on the 15q+ derivative chromosome) and
RARA-PML (on the 17q- derivative) were transcribed. The contribution of
PML to the oncogenicity of the fusion products was demonstrated by the
following: no mutations affecting RARA alone were observed in 20 APLs
analyzed; 2 APLs cytogenetically lacking t(15;17) chromosomes were found
to have rearrangements of both PML and RARA; and PML but not RARA was
molecularly rearranged in a variant APL translocation in which
chromosome 15 had been translocated to another chromosome with no
visible involvement of chromosome 17.

Tong et al. (1992) found that in 20 of 22 patients with a detectable MYL
rearrangement the breakpoints were clustered within a 4.4-kb segment,
which they designated MYL(bcr). The 2 remaining patients exhibited a
more 5-prime rearrangement at about 10-kb upstream of the MYL(bcr)
region, indicating the lack of at least one MYL gene exon in the
resulting MYL-RARA fusion gene.

Cleary (1991) pointed out that detection of the PML-RARA fusion links a
specific molecular defect in neoplasia with a characteristic biologic
and clinical response to pharmacologic therapy. It is a useful marker
for the diagnosis of APL and for the identification of patients who may
benefit from retinoid treatment.

PML, the gene involved in the breakpoint on chromosome 15, is a putative
transcription factor: it contains a cysteine-rich motif that resembles a
zinc finger DNA-binding domain common to several classes of
transcriptional factors. Two fusion genes, PML-RARA and RARA-PML, are
formed as a result of the characteristic translocation in APL.
Heterogeneity of the chromosome 15 breakpoints accounts for the diverse
architecture of the PML-RARA mRNAs isolated from different APL patients,
and alternative splicing of PML exons gives rise to multiple isoforms of
the PML-RARA mRNAs even within a single patient. Alcalay et al. (1992)
investigated the organization and expression pattern of the RARA/PML
gene in a series of APL patients. A RARA-PML transcript was present in
most but not all APL patients. Among 70 patients with APL, Diverio et
al. (1992) found an abnormality in intron 2 of the RARA gene in all
cases, with clustering of rearrangements within the 20-kb intronic
region separating exons 2 and 3. A curious difference was found in the
location of breakpoints in males and females: breakpoints at the 5-prime
end of intron 2 of the RARA gene occurred in females and 3-prime
breakpoints predominated in males.

Stock et al. (2000) pointed out that breakpoints in chromosomes 15 and
17 leading to the translocation associated with APL had been described
as located between 15q22 and 15q26, and between 17q11 and 17q25. Most
studies using FISH had indicated the chromosome 15 breakpoint to be in
15q22. Stock et al. (2000) used a combination of G-banding, FISH, and
chromosome microdissection/reverse in situ hybridization to map the
breakpoints precisely to 15q24 and 17q21.1.

Zaccaria et al. (2002) studied a rare example of cryptic translocation
causing APL. Conventional cytogenetics showed a normal karyotype; PCR
showed a typical PML-RARA rearrangement in exon 1. FISH analysis
revealed that a submicroscopic part of chromosome 15 had been inserted
into 17q. Zaccaria et al. (2002) reviewed other cases of cryptic
translocation; their report appeared to be the first in which both pairs
of chromosomes 15 and 17 were cytogenetically normal and a PML-RARA
fusion gene, discovered after FISH analysis, was located on chromosome
17. A poor response to ATRA therapy was postulated to have a
relationship to the atypical translocation.

Abreu e Lima et al. (2005) described a 47-year-old woman with acute
myeloid leukemia who had simultaneous expression of the PML/RARA and the
AML1/ETO (133435) fusion genes. Despite prolonged use of therapeutic
doses of ATRA plus chemotherapy, the patient did not achieve remission,
in contrast to the experience of most patients with such fusion genes.
Conventional cytogenetics in this case showed the presence of only the
t(8;21) translocation. In previous reports of coexpression of these 2
fusion genes there was evidence of the presence of 2 or 3 distinct
leukemic clones harboring either or both chromosomal translocations.

ANIMAL MODEL

Brown et al. (1997) established a transgenic mouse model that documented
the ability of the chimeric PML-RARA gene to initiate leukemogenesis.
The mice developed 2 currently unrelated abnormalities. The first was a
severe papillomatosis of the skin; the second was a disturbance of
hematopoiesis that presented as a partial block of differentiation in
the neutrophil lineage of the transgenic mice and then progressed at low
frequency to overt APL. The leukemia appeared to be a faithful
reproduction of the human disease, including a therapeutic response to
retinoic acid that reflected differentiation of the leukemic cells. Both
the preleukemic state and the overt leukemia could be transplanted into
nontransgenic hosts. Brown et al. (1997) commented that the model should
be useful for exploring the pathogenesis and treatment of APL.

From studies in mice with disruption of the Pml gene, Wang et al. (1998)
demonstrated that normally, PML regulates hemopoietic differentiation
and controls cell growth and tumorigenesis. PML function is essential
for the tumor-growth-suppressive activity of retinoic acid (RA) and for
its ability to induce terminal myeloid differentiation of precursor
cells. PML was needed for the RA-dependent transactivation of the
p21(Waf1/Cip1) gene (116899), which regulates cell cycle progression and
cellular differentiation. These results provided a framework for
understanding the molecular pathogenesis of APL. Whereas APL might
result from the functional interference of PML/RARA with 2 independent
pathways, PML and RXR/RAR, Wang et al. (1998) showed that these proteins
act, at least in part, in the same pathway. Thus, by simultaneously
interacting with RXR and PML, the fusion gene product may inactivate
this pathway at multiple levels, leading to the proliferative advantage
and the block of hemopoietic differentiation that characterize APL.

David et al. (1997) generated an inducible line of transgenic mice in
which the expression of PML-RARA is driven by the metallothionein
promoter. After 5 days zinc stimulation, 27 of 54 mice developed hepatic
preneoplasia and neoplasia including foci of basophilic hepatocytes,
dysplasia, and carcinoma, with a significantly higher incidence of
lesions in females than in males. The rapid onset of liver pathologies
was dependent on overexpression of the transgene, since it was not
detected in noninduced transgenic animals of the same age. The PML-RARA
protein was always present in altered tissues at much higher levels than
in the surrounding normal liver tissues. In addition, overexpression of
PML-RARA resulted in a strong proliferative response in the hepatocytes.
David et al. (1997) concluded that overexpression of PML-RARA
deregulates subproliferation and can induce tumorigenic changes in vivo.

In an animal model of acute promyelocytic leukemia, Padua et al. (2003)
developed a DNA-based vaccine by fusing the human PML-RARA oncogene to
tetanus fragment C (FrC) sequences. Padua et al. (2003) showed for the
first time that a DNA vaccine specifically targeted to an oncoprotein
can have a pronounced effect on survival, both alone and in combination
with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The survival advantage was
concomitant with time-dependent antibody production and an increase in
interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570). Padua et al. (2003) also showed that
ATRA therapy on its own triggered an immune response in this model. When
DNA vaccination and conventional ATRA therapy were combined, they
induced protective immune responses against leukemia progression in
mice. Padua et al. (2003) concluded that this may provide a new approach
to improve clinical outcome in human leukemia.

615063	TITLE *615063 SECRETOGLOBIN, FAMILY 2B, MEMBER 2; SCGB2B2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the secretoglobin family, such as SCGB2B2, are secreted
proteins of about 10 kD that are found in high concentrations in fluids
of lung, lacrimal gland, salivary gland, prostate, uterus, and other
tissues. Secretoglobins form stable dimers prior to secretion (summary
by Jackson et al., 2011).

MAPPING

Hartz (2013) mapped the SCGB2B2 gene to chromosome 19q13.11 based on an
alignment of the SCGB2B2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK093495) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607888	TITLE *607888 CKLF-LIKE MARVEL TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAIN-CONTAINING 5; CMTM5
;;CHEMOKINE-LIKE FACTOR SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 5; CKLFSF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the chemokine-like factor superfamily, including CKLFSF5,
share similarity with both the chemokine (see 604852) and the
transmembrane 4 (see 300191) superfamilies of signaling molecules.

CLONING

By screening databases for sequences that share homology with
chemokine-like factor (CKLF), followed by RT-PCR of a brain cDNA
library, Han et al. (2003) cloned CKLFSF5. They also identified
alternatively spliced variants. One isoform encodes a 156-amino acid
protein with 4 transmembrane segments. CKLFSF5 shares about 40% sequence
identity with CKLFSF3 (607886). Northern blot analysis detected a
1.22-kb transcript and several minor transcripts expressed at high
levels in brain. Han et al. (2003) also cloned mouse Cklfsf5, which
shares about 90% sequence similarity with CKLFSF5.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Han et al. (2003) mapped the CKLFSF5 gene
to chromosome 14. They also mapped the mouse Cklfsf5 gene to chromosome
14.

614364	TITLE *614364 ACETOACETYL-CoA SYNTHETASE; AACS
;;ACYL-CoA SYNTHETASE FAMILY, MEMBER 1; ACSF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

AACS (EC 6.2.1.16) is a cytosolic ligase that specifically activates the
ketone body acetoacetate to form acetoacetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) for the
synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids (Ohgami et al., 2003).

CLONING

By PCR of a HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line cDNA library using
primers based on rat Aacs, Ohgami et al. (2003) cloned human AACS. The
deduced 672-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 75.1
kD. Northern blot analysis detected AACS in all human tissues examined,
with highest expression in kidney, followed by heart and brain. AACS was
expressed in all specific brain regions examined, with highest
expression in hippocampus, followed by amygdala and thalamus.

Using Northern blot analysis, Ohnuki et al. (2005) detected Aacs in all
rat brain regions examined, with highest expression in midbrain,
pons/medulla, and cerebral cortex. In situ hybridization confirmed these
findings.

By searching databases for sequences containing acyl-CoA synthetase
motifs 1 and 2, Watkins et al. (2007) identified human AACS, which they
called ACSF1. The deduced 672-amino acid protein contains acyl-CoA
synthetase motifs 1, 2, and 5, but it lacks motifs 3 and 4. Phylogenetic
analysis revealed that ACSF1 belongs to a small group of acyl-CoA
synthetases that differ significantly from all other clades of acyl-CoA
synthetases and from each other.

GENE STRUCTURE

Watkins et al. (2007) determined that the AACS gene contains 18 exons.

MAPPING

Watkins et al. (2007) mapped the AACS gene to the plus strand of
chromosome 12q24.31.

194558	TITLE *194558 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 83; ZNF83
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Marine et al. (1994) assigned the ZNF83 gene (also known as HPF1) to
chromosome 19 by screening a human/rodent hybrid panel and localized the
gene further to 19q13.3-q13.4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and
digital imaging microscopy.

HISTORY

Conserved structural motifs define large families of nucleic acid
binding proteins in eukaryotes. The C2H2-type zinc finger motif,
conferring both specific RNA and DNA binding activities, was first
detected within the amino acid sequence of the Xenopus transcription
factor IIIA (Miller et al., 1985). Thereafter, vertebrate genomes were
shown to encode hundreds of so-called zinc finger proteins (ZFPs).
Subfamilies were defined on the basis of conserved sequence elements
outside the finger repeat, such as the KRAB domain. Several members of
these subfamilies were found to have a clustered genomic organization.

158120	TITLE *158120 MONOCYTE DIFFERENTIATION ANTIGEN CD14; CD14
;;MYELOID CELL-SPECIFIC LEUCINE-RICH GLYCOPROTEIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CD14 is a single-copy gene encoding 2 protein forms: a 50- to 55-kD
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein (mCD14) and a
monocyte or liver-derived soluble serum protein (sCD14) that lacks the
anchor. Both molecules are critical for lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-dependent signal transduction, and sCD14 confers LPS sensitivity
to cells lacking mCD14. Increased sCD14 levels are associated with
inflammatory infectious diseases and high mortality in gram-negative
shock (LeVan et al., 2001).

CLONING

Differentiation of myelomonocytic cells from pluripotent stem cells to
mature functioning monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes is accompanied
by a variety of changes, including the expression of new cell surface
antigens. One of these antigens, CD14, a 55-kD glycoprotein, is
preferentially expressed on the surface of mature cells of the monocytic
lineage. Goyert et al. (1988) isolated a cDNA clone encoding CD14 and
isolated the CD14 gene.

Ferrero et al. (1990) demonstrated that, as in man, the expression of
murine CD14 is limited to the myeloid lineage. In both mouse and man,
the CD14 protein contains leucine-rich motif that is repeated 10 times.

GENE FUNCTION

The expression profile of CD14, as well as its inclusion in the family
of leucine-rich proteins and the chromosomal location of other receptor
genes, supports the hypothesis that CD14 functions as a receptor. Its
receptor function was indeed demonstrated by Wright (1990) who showed
that it is a receptor for the lipopolysaccharide-binding
protein:lipopolysaccharide complex (LBP; 151990:LPS); also see Wright et
al. (1990). Gupta et al. (1996) transfected mouse 70Z/3 cells with human
CD14 and showed that these cells were responsive to peptidoglycan (PGN),
a polymer of alternating GlcNAc and MurNAc cross-linked by short
peptides, that is present in the cell walls of all bacteria, but is
particularly abundant in gram-positive bacteria. They concluded that
CD14 serves as a cell-activating receptor not only for LPS but also for
PGN.

Cells undergoing programmed cell death (apoptosis) are cleared rapidly
in vivo by phagocytes without inducing inflammation. Devitt et al.
(1998) showed that the glycoprotein CD14 on the surface of human
macrophages is important for the recognition and clearance of apoptotic
cells. CD14 can also act as a receptor that binds bacterial LPS,
triggering inflammatory responses. Overstimulation of CD14 by LPS can
cause the often fatal toxic-shock syndrome. Devitt et al. (1998) showed
that apoptotic cells interact with CD14, triggering phagocytosis of the
apoptotic cells. This interaction depends on a region of CD14 that is
identical to, or at least closely associated with, a region known to
bind LPS. However, apoptotic cells, unlike LPS, do not provoke the
release of proinflammatory cytokines from macrophages. These results
indicated that clearance of apoptotic cells is mediated by a receptor
whose interactions with 'nonself' components (LPS) and 'self' components
(apoptotic cells) produce distinct macrophage responses.

Savill (1998) summarized understanding of how ced-5 (see DOCK1; 601403)
and CD14 together with other molecules function in the engulfment of
cell corpses by macrophages in the process of programmed cell death. The
model incorporated the newly proposed functions of ced-5 and CD14.

LPS interacts with LBP and CD14 to present LPS to TLR4 (603030), which
activates inflammatory gene expression through NF-kappa-B (see 164011)
and MAPK signaling. Bochkov et al. (2002) demonstrated that oxidized
phospholipids inhibit LPS-induced but not TNF-alpha (191160)-induced or
interleukin-1-beta (147720)-induced NF-kappa-B-mediated upregulation of
inflammatory genes, by blocking the interaction of LPS with LBP and
CD14. Moreover, in LPS-injected mice, oxidized phospholipids inhibited
inflammation and protected mice from lethal endotoxin shock. Thus, in
severe gram-negative bacterial infection, endogenously formed oxidized
phospholipids may function as a negative feedback to blunt innate immune
responses. Furthermore, Bochkov et al. (2002) identified chemical
structures capable of inhibiting the effects of endotoxins such as LPS
that could be used for the development of new drugs for treatment of
sepsis.

Children of farmers are at decreased risk of developing allergies.
Results of epidemiologic studies suggested that increased exposure to
microbial compounds might be responsible for this reduced risk.
Alterations in adaptive immune response were thought to be the
underlying mechanism. Lauener et al. (2002) measured the expression of
receptors for microbial compounds known to trigger the innate immune
response. They showed that blood cells from farmers' children expressed
significantly higher amounts of CD14 and Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2;
603028) than those from non-farmers' children. They proposed that the
innate immune system responds to the microbial burden in the environment
and modulates the development of allergic disease.

Zanoni et al. (2009) found that stimulation of murine bone
marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) with LPS induced Src (190090)
kinase and Plcg2 (600220) activation, Ca(2+) influx, and calcineurin
(see 114105)-dependent nuclear Nfat (see 600490) translocation.
Induction of this pathway was Tlr4 independent and entirely dependent on
Cd14. Nfat activation was necessary for apoptotic death of terminally
differentiated DCs, allowing for maintenance of self-tolerance and
prevention of autoimmunity. Blocking this pathway in vivo resulted in
prolonged DC survival and an increase in T-cell priming capability.
Zanoni et al. (2009) concluded that CD14 is involved, through NFAT
activation, in regulation of the DC life cycle.

By coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic analysis, Baumann et
al. (2010) showed that CD14 interacted with TLR7 (300365) and TLR9
(605474) in mouse and human cells and was required for TLR7- and
TLR9-dependent induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Cd14 was required
for Tlr9-dependent immune responses in mice and for optimal nucleic acid
uptake in mouse macrophages. Cd14 was dispensable for viral uptake in
mice, but it was required for triggering of TLR-dependent cytokine
responses. Baumann et al. (2010) concluded that CD14 has a dual role in
nucleic acid-mediated TLR activation by promoting selective uptake of
nucleic acids and acting as a coreceptor for endosomal TLR activation.

Using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy in mouse cells, Zanoni et
al. (2011) demonstrated that Cd14 chaperoned LPS to Tlr4, leading to Syk
(600085)-dependent internalization of Tlr4 and signaling through Trif
(607601). Zanoni et al. (2011) concluded that pathogen recognition
receptors induce both membrane transport and signal transduction.

Shirey et al. (2013) reported that CD14 and TLR2 are required for
protection against influenza-induced lethality in mice mediated by
Eritoran (also known as E5564), a potent, well-tolerated, synthetic TLR4
antagonist. Therapeutic administration of Eritoran blocked
influenza-induced lethality in mice, as well as lung pathology, clinical
symptoms, cytokine and oxidized phospholipid expression, and decreased
viral titers. CD14 directly binds Eritoran and inhibits ligand binding
to MD2 (605243). Shirey et al. (2013) concluded that Eritoran blockade
of TLR signaling represents a novel therapeutic approach for
inflammation associated with influenza, and possibly other infections.

MAPPING

Goyert et al. (1988) demonstrated by in situ hybridization and study of
somatic cell hybrid DNA that the gene is located at bands 5q23-q31.
Thus, CD14 is located in a region of chromosome 5 that contains a
cluster of genes that encode several myeloid-specific growth factors
(IL3; 147740) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(CSF2; 138960) or growth factor receptors (FMS receptor for CFS1;
164770), as well as other growth factor and receptor genes
(platelet-derived growth factor receptor, 173410, beta-2-adrenergic
receptor, 109690, and endothelial cell growth factor, 131220). This is a
region that is deleted in patients with certain forms of myeloid
leukemia.

Ferrero et al. (1990) mapped the CD14 gene to mouse chromosome 18.

By fluorescence in situ hybridization studies of deleted chromosome 5
homologs in a series of 135 patients with malignant myeloid diseases, Le
Beau et al. (1993) mapped the CD14 gene and neighboring genes to 5q31.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Baldini et al. (1999) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
in the proximal CD14 promoter at position -159 from the transcription
start site, resulting in a C-to-T transition. TT homozygotes had
significantly higher levels of sCD14 than did either CC or CT genotype
carriers, and they also had lower levels of IgE. Unkelbach et al.
(1999), Hubacek et al. (1999), and Shimada et al. (2000) reported an
increased risk of myocardial infarction in individuals carrying the T
allele. (Shimada et al. (2000) and Hubacek et al. (1999) reported the
C/T polymorphism as occurring at position -260 from the translation
start site.)

Some patients with Kawasaki disease (KD), an acute febrile vasculitis of
childhood, develop coronary artery lesions after the acute phase.
Nishimura et al. (2003) found no difference in genomic and allele
frequencies of the T allele at the CD14/-159 promoter region in 67
patients with KD compared to controls. However, the KD patients with TT
genotypes had more coronary artery complications than those with CT or
CC genotypes, and the frequency of the T allele was significantly higher
than that of the C allele in KD patients. Nishimura et al. (2003)
concluded that the T allele and the TT genotype are risk factors for the
coronary artery complications in patients with KD, implicating a
possible relationship to the magnitude of the CD14 toll-like receptor
response.

Using EMSA analysis, LeVan et al. (2001) showed that the T allele at
position -159 in the proximal CD14 promoter has a decreased affinity for
DNA/protein interactions at a GC box containing a binding site for SP1
(189906), SP2 (601801), and SP3 (601804) transcription factors. Reporter
analysis demonstrated that monocytic cells with low levels of SP3, which
inhibits activating by SP1 and SP2, have increased transcriptional
activity of the T allele. In contrast, both the C and T alleles are
transcribed equivalently in SP3-rich hepatocytes. LeVan et al. (2001)
proposed that the interplay between CD14 promoter affinity and the
SP3:SP1-plus-SP2 ratio plays a critical mechanistic role in regulating
CD14 transcription and in determining the differential activity of the 2
variants of the CD14 promoter.

In a study of 216 Korean patients with IgA nephropathy (161950) who were
followed for 86 months, Yoon et al. (2003) found that an excess of the
-159C genotype occurred in patients with progressive disease (p = 0.03)
and the risk of disease progression increased as the number of C alleles
increased (p for trend = 0.002). The hazard ratio for progression in
patients with the CC genotype was 3.2 (p = 0.025) compared to patients
with the TT genotype. After lipopolysaccharide stimulation, soluble CD14
was released more abundantly from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells
of TT patients than from those of CC patients (p = 0.006), although
there was no difference in membrane-bound CD14 expression. TT patients
released less IL6 (147620) than CC patients after stimulation (p =
0.0003). Yoon et al. (2003) suggested that the CD14 -159 polymorphism is
an important marker for the progression of IgA nephropathy and may
modulate the level of the inflammatory response.

ANIMAL MODEL

Haziot et al. (1996) reported that Cd14-deficient mice were resistant to
LPS-induced shock.

Kurt-Jones et al. (2000) determined that proinflammatory cytokine
responses to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein were absent or
diminished in mice with deletions of either Cd14 or Tlr4 (603030),
respectively. Importantly, Tlr4 -/- mice had higher levels of infectious
virus in their lungs and were either unable to clear the virus or
cleared the virus several days later than wildtype mice. The authors
concluded that TLR4 and CD14 appear to be important not only in
recognizing bacterial structures such as lipopolysaccharide, but are
important in innate immune responses to viruses as well.

300090	TITLE *300090 SIGNAL SEQUENCE RECEPTOR, DELTA; SSR4
;;TRANSLOCON-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, DELTA SUBUNIT; TRAPD
DESCRIPTION Brenner et al. (1997) described 2 novel genes that are located in the
Xq28 region, are driven by a bidirectional promoter located between
them, and encode proteins involved in unrelated biochemical pathways
located in different compartments of the cell. Translocon-associated
protein (TRAP)-delta subunit is assumed to be involved in the secretion
of proteins. The highest concentration of TRAP-delta transcripts was
observed in pancreas, where large quantities of lipases, nucleases, and
proteases are synthesized and secreted. The second gene, IDH3G (300089),
encodes the gamma subunit of the NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate
dehydrogenase, which is involved in the energy metabolism of the cell.
Correspondingly, the highest expression levels are in tissues with
increased energy turnover, like heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. IDH3G
and TRAP-delta were found to be arranged in a compact head-to-head
manner. The nontranscribed intergenic region represents only 133 bp and
is embedded in a CpG island. Brenner et al. (1997) concluded that the
CpG island functions as a bidirectional promoter to initiate the
transcription of both functionally unrelated genes with quite distinct
expression patterns. The authors showed that in rat and mouse this area
is similarly compact, representing less than 249 bp in rat and not more
than 164 bp in mouse. In both species, this intergenic region is
embedded in a CpG island and is highly conserved, with nucleotide
identity values ranging from 70.1% between human and rat to 92.6%
between mouse and rat.

607389	TITLE *607389 SINGLE-STRANDED DNA-BINDING PROTEIN 2; SSBP2
;;SENSOR OF SINGLE-STRANDED DNA COMPLEX, SUBUNIT B2; SOSSB2;;
SOSS COMPLEX, SUBUNIT B2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SSBP2 is a subunit of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding complex
involved in the maintenance of genome stability (Huang et al., 2009).

CLONING

By positional cloning, Castro et al. (2002) identified a novel gene,
which they designated SSBP2, that is disrupted at the 5q13 breakpoint in
the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line ML3. EST database searching
revealed that the transcript is similar to the chicken gene CSDP, which
encodes a protein that binds single-stranded pyrimidine-rich
mirror-repeat elements with high specificity. By further database
searching, they identified 2 additional cDNAs encoding single-stranded
DNA-binding proteins, SSBP3 (607390) and SSBP4 (607391). The deduced
362-amino acid SSBP2 protein shares 83% and 73% sequence identity with
SSBP3 and SSBP4, respectively, and 100% identity with the mouse Ssbp2
homolog. SSBP family members share a highly conserved N terminus
followed by a glycine- and proline-rich domain. Northern blot analysis
detected ubiquitous expression of a 1.9-kb SSBP2 transcript. Expression
was high in all hematopoietic tissues, including spleen, lymph node,
peripheral blood, bone marrow, thymus, and fetal liver, with highest
expression in thymus and fetal liver. Expression was also high in heart,
brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Of 5 leukemia cell lines tested,
expression was highest in pre-T lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CEM. No
gross inactivating mutations were found in leukemia cell lines or in
primary leukemic blasts from 4 patients.

GENE FUNCTION

Using HEK293 cells for tandem affinity purification, Huang et al. (2009)
identified SOSSA (INTS3; 611347) and SOSSC (613273) as common components
of 2 distinct and complementary ssDNA-binding heterotrimeric complexes
defined by their inclusion of either SOSSB1 (SSBP1; 600439) or SOSSB2
(SSBP2), but not both. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that
SOSS complexes formed in HeLa cells independent of DNA damage.
Recombinant heterotrimeric SOSS complexes specifically bound ssDNA, but
not double-stranded DNA. SOSSA served as the central assembly factor,
and SOSSB and SOSSC bound overlapping regions on SOSSA, but they did not
interact directly with each other. Depletion of SOSSA by small
interfering RNA led to dramatic decreases in SOSSB1 and SOSSB2 protein
levels, abrogated targeting of SOSSB1 and SOSSB2 to chromatin, increased
ionizing radiation sensitivity, caused defective G2/M checkpoint, and
impaired homologous recombination repair. Huang et al. (2009)
demonstrated that both SOSS complexes and the CTIP (RBBP8; 604124)/RPA
(see RPA1; 179835) complex acted downstream of the MRE11 (600814)-RAD50
(604040)-NBS1 (NBN; 602667) complex and functioned in DNA damage repair.

GENE STRUCTURE

Castro et al. (2002) determined that the SSBP2, SSBP3, and SSBP4 genes
all contain 17 exons and have identical intron/exon boundaries,
suggesting duplication from a common ancestral gene. They also
identified alternative splicing and additional internal exons for all 3
genes, suggesting the existence of multiple isoforms for each protein.
The SSBP2 gene spans more than 200 kb.

MAPPING

Castro et al. (2002) mapped the SSBP2 gene to chromosome 5q13.3, within
the critical breakpoint region in the AML cell line ML3.

603646	TITLE *603646 CYTOCHROME c OXIDASE ASSEMBLY PROTEIN COX15; COX15
;;COX15, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytochrome c oxidase (COX; EC 1.9.3.1), the terminal component of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain, is a multiheteromeric enzyme embedded
in the mitochondrial inner membrane. COX consists of a protein backbone
bound to 2 copper-containing prosthetic groups, the cytochromes a and
a-3. See 123864. The S. cerevisiae cox15 protein is a constituent of the
inner mitochondrial membrane and may be involved in the assembly of the
COX protein backbone (Petruzzella et al., 1998).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences related to cox15, Petruzzella
et al. (1998) identified cDNAs encoding human COX15. The cDNAs encoded 2
COX15 isoforms, COX15.1 and COX15.2, with different C termini. The amino
acid sequences of both isoforms are 42% identical to that of yeast
cox15. Sequence analysis indicated that COX15 contains a mitochondrial
leader peptide and 5 transmembrane domains. Using in vitro mitochondrial
import and trypsin-protection assays, the authors demonstrated that the
COX15 protein is targeted to mitochondria. Northern blot analysis
revealed that COX15 is expressed as 1.5-, 1.8-, and 3-kb mRNAs
predominantly in tissues characterized by high rates of oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS), including muscle, heart, and brain.

MAPPING

Based on sequence similarity to ESTs, Petruzzella et al. (1998)
tentatively mapped the COX15 gene to 10q24.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Deficiencies in the activity of COX are a frequent cause of autosomal
recessive mitochondrial disease in infants (220110). These patients are
clinically and genetically heterogeneous. The defects identified in this
group have mostly involved genes coding for accessory proteins that play
important roles in the assembly of the COX holoenzyme complex. Antonicka
et al. (2003) used a panel of retroviral vectors expressing COX assembly
factors in these patients to identify the molecular basis of the COX
deficiency by functional complementation. They showed that
overexpression of COX15, a protein involved in the synthesis of heme A,
the heme prosthetic group for COX, could functionally complement the
isolated COX deficiency in fibroblasts from a patient with fatal
infantile who had predominantly cardiac involvement and relative sparing
of skeletal muscle (CEMCOX2; 615119).

Mutation analysis of COX15 in the patient identified an arg217-to-trp
(R217W; 603646.0001) mutation in 1 allele and a splice site mutation in
intron 3 on the other allele (C447-3G), resulting in deletion of exon 4
(603646.0002). In the patient, mitochondrial heme A content was reduced
in heart and fibroblast mitochondria, and levels of heme O were
increased in heart. COX activity and the total amount of fully assembled
enzyme were reduced by 50 to 70% in fibroblasts. Expression of COX15
increased heme A content and rescued COX activity. Thus, it appeared
that reduced availability of heme A stalls the assembly of COX. This
study established COX15 as an additional cause, along with SCO2, of
fatal infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with isolated COX
deficiency.

Oquendo et al. (2004) reported a patient with Leigh syndrome (256000)
due to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency who was homozygous for the R217W
mutation in the COX15 gene.

Bugiani et al. (2005) reported a 16-year-old Italian boy with Leigh
syndrome who was compound heterozygous for a nonsense mutation (S151X;
603646.0003) and a missense mutation (S344P; 603646.0004) in the COX15
gene. The authors noted that defects in the COX15 gene appear to be
associated with considerable clinical and biochemical heterogeneity.

In an infant girl with isolated complex IV deficiency that was more
marked in cardiac than skeletal muscle, who died at day 9 of life with
encephalopathy, respiratory depression, and marked cardiac hypertrophy
of all walls, Alfadhel et al. (2011) analyzed 6 candidate genes and
identified compound heterozygosity for the R217W missense mutation and a
nonsense mutation (S151X; 603646.0003) in the COX15 gene.

In a female infant who had fatal infantile cytochrome c oxidase
deficiency with predominantly cardiac involvement and relative sparing
of skeletal muscle (CEMCOX2; 615119), originally reported by Kennaway et
al. (1990), Antonicka et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity
for a 700C-T transition on 1 allele, resulting in an arg217-to-trp
(R217W) substitution, and a splice site mutation in intron 3 on the
other allele (C447-3G), resulting in deletion of exon 4 (603646.0002).
The splicing error introduced a frameshift and a premature stop codon,
resulting in an unstable mRNA and, likely, a null allele.

In an infant girl with isolated complex IV deficiency that was more
marked in cardiac than skeletal muscle, who died at day 9 of life with
encephalopathy, respiratory depression, and marked cardiac hypertrophy,
Alfadhel et al. (2011) identified compound heterozygosity for the R217W
missense mutation and a nonsense mutation (S151X; 603646.0003) in the
COX15 gene.

In a patient with Leigh syndrome due to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency
(256000), Oquendo et al. (2004) identified homozygosity for the R217W
mutation. Both parents were heterozygous for the mutation. The authors
noted the phenotypic variation associated with this mutation.

ser344-to-pro (S344P; 603646.0004) substitution at a conserved residue
in the C-terminal end of the fifth predicted transmembrane domain. The
patient failed to thrive in infancy, with poor sucking and feeding
difficulties, and was noted to have severe psychomotor delay at 4 months
of age, with diffuse hypotonia and muscle wasting and weakness. MRI at
18 months of age showed symmetric signal changes in the posterior part
of the putamina and bilateral cerebellar white matter abnormalities.
Plasma lactate and pyruvate levels were markedly elevated. Symptoms
worsened thereafter with virtual arrest of body growth, progressive loss
of postural control, and onset of dystonic postures in the upper limbs,
whereas cognitive functions remained relatively better preserved.
Clinical features remained grossly unchanged thereafter, and apart from
central nervous system and skeletal muscle, the patient showed no
abnormality in other tissues or organs, including the heart,
gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys, or hematopoietic system.

601143	TITLE *601143 DYNACTIN 1; DCTN1
;;p150(GLUED), DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-based biologic motor protein.
Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) noted that dyneins were initially discovered
as enzymes that couple ATP hydrolysis to provide a force for cellular
motility in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. A distinct cytoplasmic form
of dynein (600112) was subsequently characterized and thought to be
responsible for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and
organelles along microtubules (Holzbaur and Vallee, 1994). A large
macromolecular complex, dynactin, is required for the cytoplasmic
dynein-driven movement of organelles along microtubules. Dynactin is
composed of 10 distinct polypeptides of 150, 135, 62, 50 (DCTN2;
607376), 45, 42, 37, 32, 27, and 24 kD, with a combined mass of 10
million daltons. The largest polypeptide of the dynactin complex,
p150(Glued), binds directly to microtubules and to cytoplasmic dynein.
The binding of dynactin to dynein is critical for neuronal function, as
antibodies that specifically disrupt this binding block vesicle motility
along microtubules in extruded squid axoplasm. Holzbaur and Tokito
(1996) stated that the dynein-dynactin interaction is probably a key
component of the mechanism of axonal transport of vesicles and
organelles. Further evidence for a critical role for dynactin in vivo
comes from the analysis of mutations in the homologous gene in
Drosophila. Mutant alleles of the 'glued' gene induced disruption of the
neurons of the optic lobe and compound eye in heterozygotes; null
mutations are lethal.

CLONING

Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) isolated and characterized cDNA clones
encoding human p150(Glued), as well as alternatively spliced isoforms.
Using these to isolate genomic clones, they found by genomic Southern
blots that there is a single gene in the human, as had previously been
observed in rat and chick.

Jang et al. (1997) cloned and characterized mouse Dctn1. The mouse
protein shares 95% amino acid identity with the human protein. The
authors found no abnormalities of the gene in mnd2 mice.

GENE FUNCTION

Eaton et al. (2002) disrupted the dynactin complex in Drosophila, using
3 separate perturbations: dsRNA interference with arp1 (homolog of
ACTR1A; 605143), mutation in p150/Glued, and a dominant-negative Glued
transgene. In all 3 cases, the disruption resulted in an increase in the
frequency and extent of synaptic retraction events at the neuromuscular
junction. Eaton et al. (2002) concluded that dynactin functions locally
within the presynaptic arbor to promote synapse stability at the
neuromuscular junction.

Kim et al. (2004) showed that BBS4 (600374) protein localizes to the
centriolar satellites of centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia,
where it functions as an adaptor of the p150(glued) subunit of the
dynein transport machinery to recruit pericentriolar material-1 protein
(PCM1; 600299) and its associated cargo to the satellites. Silencing of
BBS4 induces PCM1 mislocalization and concomitant deanchoring of
centrosomal microtubules, arrest in cell division, and apoptotic cell
death.

Gauthier et al. (2004) showed that huntingtin (613004) specifically
enhances vesicular transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF;
113505) along microtubules. They determined that huntingtin-mediated
transport involves huntingtin-associated protein-1 (HAP1; 600947) and
the p150(Glued) subunit of dynactin, an essential component of molecular
motors. BDNF transport was attenuated both in the disease context and by
reducing the levels of wildtype huntingtin. The alteration of the
huntingtin/HAP1/p150(Glued) complex correlated with reduced association
of motor proteins with microtubules. The
polyglutamine-huntingtin-induced transport deficit resulted in the loss
of neurotrophic support and neuronal toxicity. Gauthier et al. (2004)
concluded that a key role of huntingtin is to promote BDNF transport and
suggested that loss of this function might contribute to pathogenesis.

Using in vivo skin-specific lentiviral RNA interference, Williams et al.
(2011) investigated spindle orientation regulation and provided direct
evidence that LGN (609245), NuMA (164009), and dynactin are involved. In
compromising asymmetric cell divisions, Williams et al. (2011) uncovered
profound defects in stratification, differentiation, and barrier
formation, and implicated Notch (190198) signaling as an important
effector. Williams et al. (2011) concluded that asymmetric cell division
components act by reorientating mitotic spindles to achieve
perpendicular divisions, which in turn promote stratification and
differentiation. Furthermore, the resemblance between their knockdown
phenotypes and Rbpj (147183) loss-of-function mutants provided important
clues that suprabasal Notch signaling is impaired when asymmetric cell
divisions do not occur.

GENE STRUCTURE

Collin et al. (1998) found that the DCTN1 gene spans approximately 19.4
kb of genomic DNA and consists of at least 32 exons ranging in size from
15 to 499 bp.

Pushkin et al. (2001) showed by Southern blot and BAC analyses that the
DCTN1 and SLC4A5 (606757) proteins are encoded by a single locus. The
DCTN1-SLC4A5 locus spans approximately 230 kb and contains 66 exons.
Approximately 200 kb encode SLC4A5. DCTN1 is encoded by exons 1 through
alternative exon 32. The same locus therefore uniquely encodes both a
membrane protein (SLC4A5) and a cytoplasmic protein (DCTN1) with
distinct functions.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Holzbaur and Tokito (1996) mapped
the DCTN1 gene to 2p13. They noted that the location of the gene
corresponds to that of a form of recessive limb-girdle muscular
dystrophy (see LGMD2B; 253601). Also, this region of human chromosome 2
shows syntenic homology with a region of mouse chromosome 6 containing
the mnd2 mouse mutation, which exhibits symptoms resembling human motor
neuron disease.

Korthaus et al. (1997) presented evidence that the DCTN1 gene maps to
chromosome 2 between TGFA and D2S1394.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Puls et al. (2003) identified a gly59-to-ser mutation (601143.0001) in
the DCTN1 gene in a family with slowly progressive autosomal dominant
distal hereditary motor neuronopathy with vocal paresis (HMN7B; 607641).

Among 250 patients with a putative diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; 105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified 3 mutations in
the DCTN1 gene (601143.0002-601143.0004) in 3 families. The authors
distinguished the phenotype in their patients from that reported by Puls
et al. (2003) by the presence of upper motor neuron signs, although
specific clinical details were lacking. Munch et al. (2004) suggested
that mutations in the DCTN1 gene may be a susceptibility factor for ALS.

In affected members of 8 families with Perry syndrome (168605), Farrer
et al. (2009) identified 5 different heterozygous mutations in the DCTN1
gene (see, e.g., 601143.0006-601143.0007). In vitro functional
expression studies indicated that the mutations resulted in decreased
microtubule binding and intracytoplasmic inclusions.

Vilarino-Guell et al. (2009) sequenced the DCTN1 gene in 286 individuals
with Parkinson disease (PD; 168600), frontotemporal lobar degeneration
(FTLD; 600274), or ALS. None of the 36 variants identified segregated
conclusively within families, suggesting that DCTN1 mutations are rare
and do not play a common role in these diseases. Further analysis of 440
patients with PD, 374 with FTLD, and 372 with ALS without a family
history also failed to find an association between DCTN1 variants and
disease. In fact, the previously reported pathogenic mutation T1249I
(601143.0002) was identified in 3 of 435 controls and did not segregate
in a large pedigree with Parkinson disease, thus weakening the evidence
for the pathogenicity of this variant.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
NEURONOPATHY, DISTAL HEREDITARY MOTOR, TYPE VIIB
DCTN1, GLY59SER

In a North American family with a slowly progressive, autosomal dominant
form of lower motor neuron with vocal cord paresis but without sensory
symptoms (607641), Puls et al. (2003) found a single-basepair change in
the DCTN1 gene (957C-T) resulting in an amino acid substitution of
serine for glycine at position 59 in affected family members. The G59S
substitution occurred in the highly conserved CAP-Gly motif of the
p150(Glued) subunit of dynactin, a domain that binds directly to
microtubules. The transport protein dynactin is required for
dynein-mediated retrograde transport of vesicles and organelles along
microtubules. Overexpression of dynamitin (607376), the p50 subunit of
the dynactin complex, disrupts the complex and produces a late-onset,
progressive motor neuron disease in transgenic mice (LaMonte et al.,
2002).

Based on crystal structure, gly59 is embedded in a beta-sheet. In
budding yeast, Moore et al. (2009) generated a G59S-analogous mutation
that resulted in complete loss of the CAP-Gly domain. Functional
expression studies showed that the CAP-Gly domain has a critical role in
the initiation and persistence of dynein-dependent movement of the
mitotic spindle and nucleus, but was otherwise dispensable for
dynein-based movement. The function also appeared to be
context-dependent, such as during mitosis, indicating that CAP-Gly
activity may only be necessary when dynein needs to overcome high force
thresholds to produce movement. The CAP-Gly domain was not the primary
link between dynactin and microtubules, although it was involved in the
interaction.

.0002
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, THR1249ILE

In a woman with a disorder similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous 4546C-T
transition in exon 13 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a thr1249-to-ile
(T1249I) substitution. She had disease onset at age 56 years, with gait
disturbance and distal lower limb muscle weakness and atrophy. The
symptoms were slowly progressive over 4 years. There was no involvement
of the upper limbs or bulbar region. There was no family history. The
mutation was not identified in 150 control subjects. See also 607641.

Vilarino-Guell et al. (2009) identified the T1249I variant in 3 of 435
controls, 5 of 440 patients with Parkinson disease (168600), 1 of 374
with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (600274), and 5 of 372 patients
with ALS. Lack of segregation of the variant in a large pedigree with
Parkinson disease weakened the evidence for the pathogenicity of this
variant.

.0003
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, MET571THR

In a woman with probable ALS (105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified a
heterozygous 2512T-C transition in exon 15 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting
in a met571-to-thr (M571T) substitution. She had onset of upper limb
involvement at age 48 years and developed bulbar symptoms within 8
years. Her sister was similarly affected, although DNA was not
available. The mutation was not identified in 150 control subjects.

.0004
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, ARG785TRP

In 2 brothers with probable ALS (105400), Munch et al. (2004) identified
a heterozygous 3153C-T transition in exon 20 of the DCTN1 gene,
resulting in an arg785-to-trp (R785W) substitution. The proband had
upper limb onset at age 55 years, whereas his brother had bulbar onset
at age 64 years. The asymptomatic mother and sister carried the same
mutation, suggesting incomplete penetrance. The mutation was not
identified in 150 control subjects.

.0005
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
DCTN1, ARG1101LYS

In a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (105400), Munch et al.
(2005) identified a heterozygous 4102G-A transition in the DCTN1 gene,
resulting in an arg1101-to-lys (R1101K) substitution. The patient's
brother, who also carried the R1101K mutation, had frontotemporal
dementia without motor involvement. Family history revealed that 2
additional family members reportedly had motor neuron disease and
frontotemporal dementia, respectively, but their DNA was not available
for testing. The mutation was not identified in 500 control individuals.
Despite the molecular findings, Munch et al. (2005) suggested that the
R1101K variant may not be the primary gene defect in this family.

.0006
PERRY SYNDROME
DCTN1, GLY71ARG

In affected members of 2 unrelated families with Perry syndrome
(168605), Farrer et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 211G-A
transition in exon 2 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a gly71-to-arg
(G71R) substitution in a highly conserved residue within the GKNDG
binding motif of the CAP-Gly domain. The families were of Canadian and
Turkish ancestry, respectively, and haplotype analysis excluded a
founder effect. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutation decreased microtubule binding and resulted in intracytoplasmic
inclusions.

.0007
PERRY SYNDROME
DCTN1, GLN74PRO

In affected members of a Japanese family with Perry syndrome (168605),
Farrer et al. (2009) identified a heterozygous 221A-C transversion in
exon 2 of the DCTN1 gene, resulting in a gln74-to-pro (Q74P)
substitution in a highly conserved residue adjacent to the GKNDG binding
motif of the CAP-Gly domain. In vitro functional expression studies
showed that the mutation decreased microtubule binding and resulted in
intracytoplasmic inclusions.

NECTIN 1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

PVRL1, or nectin-1, belongs to the nectin subfamily of
immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules that participate in
Ca(2+)-independent cell-cell adhesion. Nectins bind to the actin
cytoskeleton through the adaptor protein afadin (MLLT4; 159559) and are
key components of adherens junctions (summary by Barron et al. (2008)).

CLONING

Members of the immunoglobin (Ig) superfamily have been shown to serve as
receptors for various viruses. The human poliovirus receptor (PVR;
173850) is an integral membrane protein with one V-like extracellular Ig
domain, 2 C-like extracellular Ig domains, a transmembrane region, and
an intracytoplasmic region. Lopez et al. (1995) isolated a cDNA for a
poliovirus receptor related gene, which they symbolized PRR. The
predicted protein is 518 amino acids long and has a domain structure
similar to PVR. In the extracellular domain, PRR is nearly 52% identical
to PVR and 54% identical to the murine homolog of PVR. Northern blots
showed a major 5.9-kb mRNA in all tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the Don Chinese hamster line, Carritt and Goldfarb (1976) found
that susceptibility to herpesvirus is determined by a gene on chromosome
3. Francke and Francke (1979) used a V79 line and concluded that human
chromosome 11 is responsible for susceptibility; Don and V79 did not
complement.

Geraghty et al. (1998) showed that poliovirus receptor-related protein-1
mediated entry of several alphaherpesviruses, including herpes simplex
viruses (HSV) 1 and 2, porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV), and bovine
herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) into cells. The poliovirus receptor itself
mediated entry of PRV and BHV-1, but not of the HSV strains tested by
Geraghty et al. (1998). They found that PVRR1 was expressed in human
cells of epithelial and neuronal origin and concluded that it is a prime
candidate for the coreceptor that allows both HSV-1 and HSV-2 to infect
epithelial cells on mucosal surfaces and spread to cells of the nervous
system.

Using immunolocalization of adult mouse hippocampal sections Mizoguchi
et al. (2002) found that the nectin-afadin system colocalizes with the
cadherin (see 192090)-catenin (see 116805) system at synapses between
mossy fiber terminals and dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA3 area.
Nectins-1 and -3 (PVRL3; 607147) asymmetrically localize at the pre- and
postsynaptic sides of puncta adherentia junctions, respectively. During
development, nectins-1 and -3 asymmetrically localize not only at puncta
adherentia junctions but also at synaptic junctions. Using rat
hippocampal neurons in culture, Mizoguchi et al. (2002) observed that
inhibition of the nectin-based adhesion results in a decrease in synapse
size and a concomitant increase in synapse number.

Togashi et al. (2011) found that mouse hair cells and supporting cells
express the immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecules nectin-1 and -3,
respectively, and that their interaction mediates the heterotypic
adhesion between these 2 cell types. Genetic removal of nectin-1 or -3
disrupted the checkerboard-like pattern, inducing aberrant attachment
between hair cells. When cells expressing either nectin-1 or -3 were
cocultured, they arranged themselves into a mosaic pattern. Thus,
Togashi et al. (2011) concluded that nectin-1 and nectin-3 promote the
formation of the checkerboard-like pattern of the auditory epithelia.

MAPPING

Lopez et al. (1995) mapped the PVRR gene to 11q23-q24 by in situ
hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

The cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia syndrome (CLPED1; 225060),
which has been called both Zlotogora-Ogur syndrome and Margarita Island
ectodermal dysplasia, is characterized clinically by cleft lip/palate,
hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, developmental defects of the hands, and,
in some cases, mental retardation. Although generally rare, CLPED1
occurs with a frequency of approximately 1 per 2,000 among the
indigenous population of Margarita Island, in whom Suzuki et al. (1998)
assigned the CLPED1 locus to 11q23 by linkage mapping. Suzuki et al.
(2000) genotyped markers spanning the CLPED1 interval in an inbred
Israeli family with a diagnosis of Zlotogora-Ogur syndrome. The proband
was homozygous and the first-cousin parents heterozygous for all markers
tested, but with a different disease-associated haplotype than in
Margarita Island families, consistent with allelism between Margarita
Island and Israeli CLPED1. Suzuki et al. (2000) followed a positional
cloning approach to identify the CLPED1 gene as PVRL1, encoding
nectin-1, an immunoglobulin-related transmembrane cell-cell adhesion
molecule that is part of the NAP cell adhesion system. Nectin-1 is also
the principal cell surface receptor for alpha-herpesviruses (Geraghty et
al., 1998). Suzuki et al. (2000) speculated that the high frequency of
CLPED1 on Margarita Island in the Caribbean Sea might have resulted from
resistance of heterozygotes to infection by these viruses.

In Margarita Island CLPED1 patients, Suzuki et al. (2000) identified a
nonsense mutation (W185X; 600644.0001) in the PVRL1 gene.

Sozen et al. (2001) demonstrated a highly significant association
between heterozygosity for the W185X mutation and sporadic, nonsyndromic
cleft lip with or without cleft palate (see 225060) in northern
Venezuela.

ANIMAL MODEL

Barron et al. (2008) found that nectin-1 -/- mice were viable and
fertile, but manifested microphthalmia and defective amelogenesis of
their incisor teeth. Nectin-1 -/- incisors lacked the normal iron
pigmentation characteristic of rodent enamel and were prone to wear and
breakage. Immunohistochemical analysis of wildtype mice showed nectin-1
staining at the interface between the maturation-stage ameloblasts and
the underlying cells of the stratum intermedium. In the absence of
nectin-1, these cell layers were separated. Numerous large desmosomes
were present at this interface in wildtype mice; however, where adhesion
persisted in nectin-1 -/- mice, the desmosomes were smaller and less
numerous. Barron et al. (2008) concluded that nectin-1 participates in
desmosome assembly.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CLEFT LIP/PALATE-ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME

PVRL1, TRP185TER

In Margarita Island CLPED1 patients (225060), Suzuki et al. (2000)
identified a nonsense mutation of codon trp185 (TGG to TAG) in the PVRL1
gene.

Sozen et al. (2001) demonstrated a highly significant association
between heterozygosity for the W185X mutation and nonsyndromic, sporadic
cleft lip with or without cleft palate (see 119530) in northern
Venezuela. In the Cumana region of northern Venezuela, 14 (5.8%) of 243
individuals with cleft lip with or without cleft palate carried this
mutation, versus 1 of 245 controls (0.4%) (p = 0.00039).

CLEFT LIP/PALATE-ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
PVRL1, 1-BP DEL

In an Israeli family with cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia (225060)
reported by Zlotogora et al. (1987), Suzuki et al. (2000) identified
deletion of 1 guanine from codon 185 (trp) of the PVRL1 gene, converting
TGG to T-G and resulting in a frameshift. Notably this involved the same
codon as was involved in a nonsense mutation in the Margarita Island
CLEPD1 patients (600644.0001).

.0003
CLEFT LIP/PALATE-ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA SYNDROME
PVRL1, 1-BP DUP

In a Brazilian family with CLEPD1 (225060), Suzuki et al. (2000)
identified a single-base duplication in codon gly323 of the PVRL1 gene
(GGT to GGTT), resulting in frameshift.

;;FGFR1 ONCOGENE PARTNER; FOP
FOP/FGFR1 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using 5-prime RACE with FGFR1 primers on t(6;8) malignant cell cDNA,
followed by database searches, Popovici et al. (1999) isolated a cDNA
encoding FOP from a PAC localized on 6q27. The deduced 399-amino acid,
hydrophilic FOP protein has N- and C-terminal alpha helices harboring
leucine-rich repeats. Popovici et al. (1999) identified additional cDNAs
encoding a variant 331-amino acid protein, in which exon 11 is not
spliced out, resulting in a truncation due to an in-frame stop codon.
EST database searches suggested that FOP may be a member of a novel gene
family. Northern blot analysis detected ubiquitous expression of major
FOP transcripts of 1.2 and 1.7 kb. Highest expression, with an
additional 3.0-kb transcript, was found in heart. RT-PCR analysis
detected expression in hematopoietic cells and various malignant cell
lines.

- FOP-FGFR1 Fusion Gene

The 8p11 myeloproliferative disorder (613523) is caused by
translocations involving the tyrosine kinase-bearing FGFR1 gene (136350)
on chromosome 8p11 and various partner genes. Using RT-PCR, Popovici et
al. (1999) detected both FGFR1-FOP and FOP-FGFR1 fusion transcripts,
with the break occurring in intron 8 of FGFR1 or intron 6 of FOP, in 2
patients with the disorder but not in normal subjects or those with
other tumors.

GENE STRUCTURE

Popovici et al. (1999) determined that the FOP gene contains 13 exons
and spans more than 40 kb.

608977	TITLE *608977 DNAJ/HSP40 HOMOLOG, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 19; DNAJC19
;;TRANSLOCASE OF INNER MITOCHONDRIAL MEMBRANE 14, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF;
TIM14
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to yeast Tim14, Mokranjac et al.
(2003) identified human TIM14. The deduced 116-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain, followed by 3 alpha-helical
segments characteristic of the J domain of E. coli DnaJ (see 608375). In
yeast, Tim14 is located at the inner mitochondrial membrane and the J
domain faces the matrix space.

Using RT-PCR on total RNA isolated from fibroblasts, Davey et al. (2006)
detected a dominant full-length 525-bp product as well as a minor 445-bp
product lacking exon 4 in all tissues examined. The full-length protein
has a predicted molecular mass of 12.5 kD. They identified a single
N-terminal transmembrane segment, a predicted mitochondrial targeting
sequence, and a C-terminal J domain,

GENE FUNCTION

Mokranjac et al. (2003) determined that yeast Tim14 is a component of
the mitochondrial protein import motor. They found that Tim14 interacts
with Hsp70 (see 140550) in an ATP-dependent manner and has a profound
effect on the interaction of Hsp70 with Tim44 (605058).

Sinha et al. (2010) showed that human MAGMAS (PAM16; 614336) is an
ortholog of S. cerevisiae Pam16; it has similar functions and is
critical for protein translocation across the mitochondrial inner
membrane. MAGMAS localized to mitochondria and was peripherally
associated with inner mitochondrial membrane in yeast and humans. MAGMAS
formed a stable subcomplex with DNAJC19 through its C-terminal region
and was tethered to the TIM23 (605034) complex of yeast and humans.
Sinha et al. (2010) proposed that mutations resulting in decreased
stability of functional MAGMAS:DNAJC19 subcomplex at the human TIM23
channel may lead to impaired protein import and cellular respiration in
some patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

GENE STRUCTURE

Davey et al. (2006) determined that the DNAJC19 gene contains 6 exons
spanning 5.2 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the DNAJC19
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP SHGC-77577).

Davey et al. (2006) noted that the DNAJC19 gene maps to chromosome
3q26.33.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 16 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and ataxia, also called
3-methylglutaconic aciduria type V (MGCA5; 610198), from a Canadian
Dariusleut Hutterite population, Davey et al. (2006) identified
homozygosity for a splice-site mutation in the DNAJC19 gene
(608977.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
3-@METHYLGLUTACONIC ACIDURIA, TYPE V
DNAJC19, IVS3, G-C, -1 (dbSNP rs137854888)

In 16 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and ataxia (610198) from
consanguineous Canadian Dariusleut Hutterite families, Davey et al.
(2006) identified homozygosity for a -1G-C transversion in intron 3 of
the DNAJC19 gene, predicted to prevent splicing of exon 4 into the
DNAJC19 mRNA (delta-ex4). By expression analysis, a dominant full-length
545-bp product and a minor 445-bp product corresponding to delta-ex4
were detected in normal tissues and in a non-Hutterite control subject.
In an affected patient, only the 445-bp product was detected. Davey et
al. (2006) suggested that alternative splicing is common at this site.
Unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation; the mutation was
not found in 236 controls.

Chong et al. (2012) identified this mutation in heterozygous state in 42
individuals among 1,504 U.S. Schmiedeleut (S-leut) Hutterites screened,
for a carrier frequency of 0.028 (1 in 36). No homozygotes for this
mutation were identified. This is a private mutation in the Hutterite
population.

107830	TITLE *107830 ARGINASE II; ARG2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Spector et al. (1980) presented evidence for the existence of 2
arginases. The one found in liver and red cells (ARG1; 608313) is
severely deficient in argininemia (207800). In patients with this
disorder, some urea is produced, presumably because the arginase of
kidney, brain, and gastrointestinal tract is less affected; 'liver-type'
enzyme constitutes only about half the enzyme in these tissues. In
argininemia, kidney enzyme is about 3 times normal. Spector et al.
(1980, 1983) demonstrated immunologic differences between liver and
kidney enzymes by means of rabbit anti-human liver arginase. In addition
to the immunologic differences and differences in tissue location, the
second enzyme differs in electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide
gels, in its quantitatively different requirement for divalent manganese
activation, and in its differential inhibition by proline and
isoleucine; it is localized to the mitochondrial matrix, whereas
arginase I is cytoplasmic.

Vockley et al. (1996) found several EST database sequences with 40 to
60% homology to ARG1 and used these sequences to clone the human ARG2
gene from a Jurkat cDNA library. The ARG2 gene encodes a 355-amino acid
polypeptide. Comparing the amino acid sequences of ARG1 and ARG2,
Vockley et al. (1996) noted 6 short regions of 92% identity in conserved
regions and about 42% identity throughout the remainder of the
sequences. Using Northern blotting and RT-PCR, Vockley et al. (1996)
found that ARG2 is expressed as a 1.5-kb mRNA in a wide variety of
tissues, with highest levels of expression in prostate, brain, and
kidney. The authors also observed 2 other transcripts of 2.0 and 4.0 kb
expressed in prostate tissue. Gotoh et al. (1996) cloned the human ARG2
gene. They noted that it contained a mitochondrial import sequence, and
showed that in transfected COS-7 cells the protein is imported into the
mitochondria with appropriate proteolysis.

Morris et al. (1997) found that the predicted sequence of human type II
arginase is 58% identical to the sequence of human type I arginase but
is 71% identical to the sequence of Xenopus type II arginase, suggesting
that duplication of the arginase gene occurred before mammals and
amphibians diverged. Seven residues known to be essential for activity
are conserved in all arginases. Type II arginase mRNA was detected in
virtually all human and mouse RNA samples tested, whereas type I
arginase mRNA was found only in liver. Morris et al. (1997) speculated
that multiple type II arginase mRNAs in humans may arise from
differential RNA processing or usage of alternative promoters.

GENE FUNCTION

Vockley et al. (1996) stated that ARG2 may be inducible and may be
essential in the regulation of nitric oxide synthesis by modulating
local arginine concentrations. Gotoh et al. (1996) showed that ARG2 mRNA
and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA were coinduced by
lipopolysaccharide in a macrophage-like cell line. This coinduction was
enhanced by dexamethasone and dibutyryl cAMP, and was prevented by
interferon-gamma (147570).

In a review and discussion of the human arginases and arginase
deficiency, Iyer et al. (1998) provided a brief history leading up to
the cloning of the ARG2 gene. They pointed out that the mitochondrial
location of ARG2 and its coinduction with ornithine aminotransferase
(613349) and involvement with proline biosynthesis in lactating rat
mammary gland had led to the inference that ARG2 is involved in
biosynthetic functions, as opposed to the metabolic ones of the urea
cycle. The many metabolic fates of arginine and its immediate product
ornithine were diagrammed in their Figure 4. They presented evidence for
the role of ARG2 in nitric oxide and polyamine metabolism.

MAPPING

By PCR analysis of somatic cell hybrid panels, fluorescence in situ
hybridization, and radiation hybrid analysis, Gotoh et al. (1997) mapped
the ARG2 gene to 14q24.1-q24.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Deignan et al. (2006) created mice with individual and combined knockout
of Arg1 and Arg2. Arg1 knockout animals died by 14 days of age from
hyperammonemia, while Arg2 knockout mice had no obvious phenotype. The
double Arg1/Arg2 knockout mice exhibited the phenotype of the
Arg1-knockout mice, with the additional absence of Arg2 not exacerbating
the phenotype. Plasma amino acid measurements in the double knockout
mice showed arginine levels increased roughly 100-fold and ornithine
decreased roughly 10-fold compared with wildtype. Arginine and ornithine
levels were also altered in liver, kidney, brain, and small intestine in
the double knockout mice.

SRC2 ONCOGENE, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION The cell-derived domain of Gardner-Rasheed feline sarcoma virus consists
of a gamma-actin sequence and a tyrosine-specific protein kinase
sequence called v-fgr. By means of a v-fgr probe, Tronick et al. (1985)
isolated a human homolog. Analysis showed that the human DNA is distinct
from all other retroviral oncogenes. They localized the FGR oncogene to
1p36.2-p36.1 by in situ hybridization. By Southern analysis of somatic
cell hybrids, Nishizawa et al. (1986) confirmed the assignment of the
FGR locus to chromosome 1. FGR, which is the presently used designation,
is the same as the oncogene earlier called SRC2. The latter was mapped
to 1p36-p34 by Le Beau et al. (1984) using in situ hybridization and by
Lebo et al. (1984) using dual-beam chromosome sorting and spot blot DNA
analysis. Dracopoli et al. (1988) assigned SRC2 to 1p by analysis of DNA
from a panel of somatic cell hybrids and by linkage analysis in the CEPH
families. The latter studies showed that the SRC2 locus is 3.1 cM from
the Rh blood group locus. They favored the gene order:
1pter--PND--ALPL--FUCA1--SRC2(FGR)--Rh--D1S57--MYCL.

602394	TITLE *602394 NUCLEOLAR AND COILED-BODY PHOSPHOPROTEIN 1; NOLC1
;;NUCLEOLAR PROTEIN, 130-KD; p130;;
NOPP140
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a monoclonal antibody-based strategy to search for nuclear
proteins that fluctuate during the cell cycle, Pai et al. (1995)
identified nucleolar protein p130. They cloned a cDNA encoding p130 by
immunoscreening a human HL60 cDNA library. The predicted 699-amino acid
protein contains a motif that consists of a long serine-rich stretch
interspersed with acidic residues; this motif is repeated 10 times. The
amino acid sequence of p130 is 74% identical to that of rat nucleolar
protein Nopp140, with the N and C termini and the serine-acidic
stretches showing the most conservation. Western blot analysis of
purified p130 showed that it is a 130-kD protein that is converted to 95
kD by phosphatase treatment. A cellular casein kinase II (115540,
115541, 115542) activity is responsible for the highly phosphorylated
state of p130. During mitosis, p130 may be subject to additional
phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase (116940). By immunofluorescence, p130 is
localized to the nucleoli of interphase cells but is undetectable in
cells in the mitotic phase. P130 appears as dot-like granules that are
assembled in the nucleoplasm at telophase and early G1-phase before
migrating into the nucleoli to form part of the dense fibrillar
component, the subnucleolar region for pre-rRNA synthesis and
processing. Pai et al. (1995) suggested that the functions of p130 are
related to nucleologenesis.

GENE FUNCTION

The human nuclear protein p130, which Chen et al. (1999) named NOPP140,
is thought to shuttle between nucleolus and cytoplasm. However, the
predominant nucleolar localization of NOPP140 homologs from different
species suggests that NOPP140 is also involved in events occurring
within the nucleolus. Chen et al. (1999) demonstrated that the largest
subunit of RNA polymerase I, RPA194, coimmunoprecipitates with NOPP140.
Double immunofluorescence showed that NOPP140 colocalizes with RNA
polymerase I at the active foci of rRNA gene (rDNA) transcription in the
nucleolus. These results suggest that NOPP140 can interact with RNA
polymerase I in vivo. Transfected cells expressing the N-terminal half
of NOPP140 displayed altered nucleoli with crescent-shaped structures.
This phenotype is reminiscent of the segregated nucleoli induced by
actinomycin D treatment, which is known to inhibit rRNA synthesis.
Consistently, the N-terminal half of NOPP140 mislocalized the endogenous
RNA polymerase I and shut off cellular rDNA transcription as revealed by
an in situ run-on assay. These dominant-negative effects of the
N-terminal half of NOPP140 suggest that NOPP140 plays an essential role
in rDNA transcription. Ectopic expression of NOPP140 to a very high
level caused the formation of a transcriptionally inactive spherical
structure that occupied the entire nucleolar area and trapped RNA
polymerase I, fibrillarin (FBL; 134795), and NOPP140 but excluded
nucleolin (NCL; 164035). The mislocalizations of these nucleolar
proteins after NOPP140 overexpression imply that NOPP140 may also play
roles in maintenance of nucleolar integrity.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300) is an autosomal recessive
neurodegenerative disease caused by reduced SMN (see SMN1; 600354)
levels. The assembly machinery containing SMN is implicated in the
biogenesis of the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(snRNPs). SMN is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it
transiently accumulates in subnuclear domains named Cajal bodies (CBs)
and functions in the maturation of snRNPs and small nucleolar (sno)RNPs.
Renvoise et al. (2009) showed that the U snRNA export factors PHAX
(RNUXA; 604924) and CRM1 (XPO1; 602559) and the box C/D snoRNP core
protein fibrillarin concentrated in CBs from SMA fibroblast cells,
whereas the box H/ACA core proteins GAR1 (NOLA1; 606468) and
NAP57/dyskerin (DKC1; 300126) showed reduced CB localization. The
functional deficiency in SMA cells was associated with decreased
localization of the snoRNP chaperone Nopp140 in CBs that correlated with
disease severity. RNA interference knockdown experiments in control
fibroblasts demonstrated that SMN was required for accumulation of
Nopp140 in CBs. Conversely, overexpression of SMN in SMA cells restored
the CB localization of Nopp140, whereas SMN mutants found in SMA
patients were defective in promoting the association of Nopp140 with
CBs. Renvoise et al. (2009) concluded that only a subset of CB functions
was impaired in SMA cells and that a decrease of Nopp140 localization in
CBs may be a phenotypic marker for SMA.

;;ASPARTYL/ASPARAGINYL-BETA-HYDROXYLASE; HAAH;;
BAH
JUNCTIN, INCLUDED;;
JUNCTATE, INCLUDED;;
HUMBUG, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ASPH gene encodes 3 proteins, ASPH, junctin, and junctate (or
humbug), that differ significantly in their C-terminal domains. Only
ASPH contains a C-terminal catalytic domain, which catalyzes the
posttranslational hydroxylation of aspartic acid or asparagine residues
within epidermal growth factor (EGF; 131530)-like domains of numerous
proteins (Dinchuk et al., 2002).

CLONING

Korioth et al. (1994) reported the cloning and characterization of the
human gene encoding aspartate beta-hydroxylase (ASPH; EC 1.14.11.16).
The enzyme recognizes a consensus peptide sequence and specifically
hydroxylates the beta carbon of aspartic acid or asparagine residues in
certain epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of a number of
proteins. Among these are protein C (612283), coagulation factors VII
(613878), IX (300746), and X (613872), and the complement factors C1R
(613785) and C1S (120580). Korioth et al. (1994) selected a cDNA from an
osteosarcoma cDNA library by immunoscreening with an antiserum raised
against membrane fractions from these cells. The cDNA was shown to share
significant similarity with the bovine sequence. Two transcripts of 4.4
and 2.4 kb were seen with varying intensity in Northern blots of most
tissues. Based on Western blots, Korioth et al. (1994) also presented
evidence suggesting that posttranslational cleavage of the catalytic
carboxyl terminus occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 114550), one of the most prevalent
tumors in the world which occurs with especially high frequency in
sub-Saharan Africa and the Far East, a specific antigen is highly
expressed; it is highly expressed also in cholangiocarcinomas.
Lavaissiere et al. (1996) reported cDNA cloning of the human gene
encoding this antigen, aspartyl(asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase
(symbolized HAAH by them), and demonstrated that in these tumor lines it
is expressed in an enzymatically active form. The gene encodes a deduced
744-amino acid polypeptide with high homology (81%) to the bovine gene
(Jia et al., 1992). Lavaissiere et al. (1996) found that their cDNA
human sequence was 99% homologous to the sequence for ASPH reported by
Korioth et al. (1994), differing only at amino acid residues 565 (tyr to
ile), 575 (trp-trp-thr to cys-gly), 585 (asp to gln), and 709 (arg to
lys). They noted also a silent TCG-to-TCA transition at peptide residue
161. Lavaissiere et al. (1996) speculated about the possible
relationship of the malignant phenotype of regulated
aspartyl/asparaginyl-beta-hydroxylation in EGF-like domains of proteins
such as the mammalian Notch homologs (e.g., 190198, 600275, and 600276),
which are known to be involved in cell differentiation and whose
cytoplasmic domains have been shown to be oncogenic.

Junctin is a 26-kD transmembrane calsequestrin (CASQ; 114250)-binding
protein detected in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) from cardiac
and striated muscle tissue. It also colocalizes with the ryanodine
receptor (RYR; 180901) and triadin (TRDN; 603283). Using a rabbit
junctin cDNA probe to screen a human heart muscle cDNA library, Wetzel
et al. (2000) isolated a cDNA encoding junctin. The deduced 225-amino
acid protein, which is 86% identical to the canine sequence, contains
charged residues adjacent to the 22-amino acid transmembrane domain,
suggesting that the N-terminal 24 residues face the cytoplasm with the
remainder in the SR lumen. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.8-kb
transcript in human cardiac muscle. An increase in junctin expression
was detected after birth in rabbit heart muscle.

By screening a heart cDNA library, followed by RT-PCR, Lim et al. (2000)
isolated cDNAs encoding the 225-amino acid junctin protein and a
210-amino acid isoform. The authors noted that a 73-residue stretch in
junctin has a completely matched region in the ASPH protein. Southern
blot analysis indicated that junctin and ASPH exist as a single-copy
gene. Northern blot analysis revealed expression of 3.0- and 4.2-kb
transcripts in cardiac and skeletal muscle; expression was higher in
skeletal muscle. SDS-PAGE analysis of the translated cDNAs showed
expression of 26- and 28-kD proteins.

By screening a skeletal muscle cDNA library with a dog junctin probe,
Treves et al. (2000) identified cDNAs encoding human junctin and
junctate. Sequence analysis predicted that junctate, a 299-amino acid
protein, shares the first 93 amino acids of the long isoform of junctin
(and, partially, of ASPH), whereas its 64 C-terminal residues are
identical to the central region of ASPH. Northern blot analysis detected
a 2.6-kb transcript in heart, brain, pancreas, placenta, lung, liver,
kidney, and skeletal muscle; highest levels were in heart, brain, and
pancreas, and lowest levels were in skeletal muscle. In contrast,
junctin was expressed only in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Southern blot
and PCR analyses indicated that ASPH, junctin, and junctate are splice
variants of the same gene; ASPH uses exons 1, 3, 5, and 8 through 16,
whereas junctin uses exons 2, 3, 5, and 6, and junctate uses exons 2
through 5 and 8 through 16. Fluorescence microscopy showed junctate
expression in sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum membranes. Immunoblot
analysis indicated that junctate is expressed as a 32-kD protein in
kidney microsomes. Binding analysis determined that junctate binds
calcium with high capacity and moderate affinity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dinchuk et al. (2002) stated that the mouse Asph gene contains 24 exons
and spans more than 200 kb.

MAPPING

Using FISH, Treves et al. (2000) mapped the ASPH gene to chromosome
8q12.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Dinchuk et al. (2002) disrupted the catalytic domain of Asph in mice
such that the coding regions of junctin and junctate remained
undisturbed. Asph-null mice displayed several developmental defects,
including syndactyly, facial dysmorphology, and a mild defect in hard
palate formation. The developmental defects were similar to those
observed in knockouts and hypomorphs of the Notch (see 190198) ligand
Serrate-2 (JAG2; 602570). Dinchuk et al. (2002) proposed that aspartyl
beta-hydroxylation of EGF domains can modulate Notch pathway signaling.
In addition, crossing Asph-null mice with mice carrying the Apc
(611731)-minimum mutation, which leads to the formation of multiple
intestinal polyps, resulted in a significant increase in region-specific
polyp size and frequency.

606439	TITLE *606439 ATLASTIN GTPase 1; ATL1
;;ATLASTIN;;
SPG3A GENE; SPG3A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The ATL1 gene encodes atlastin-1, a dynamin-related GTPase, which plays
a role in formation of the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network
and in axon elongation in neurons (Zhu et al., 2006; Orso et al., 2009).

CLONING

By positional cloning, Zhao et al. (2001) demonstrated that a form of
autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia with early onset
(SPG3A; 182600), before the age of 10 years and usually before the age
of 5, is caused by mutation in a GTPase gene. The gene was found to have
no homology to genes that cause other forms of hereditary spastic
paraplegia. It does show significant homology to guanylate binding
protein-1 (GBP1; 600411), a member of the dynamin family of large
GTPases. Northern blot analysis of ATL1 expression detected a 2.2-kb
transcript primarily in adult and fetal brain. RT-PCR experiments
indicated measurable expression in all tissues examined, although
expression in adult brain was at least 50-fold higher than in other
tissues. Translation of the 2.2-kb cDNA sequence of ATL1 yielded a
peptide of 558 amino acids.

By PCR of a cerebral cortex cDNA library, Zhu et al. (2003) cloned ATL1,
which they called atlastin-1. The deduced 558-amino acid protein
contains GTP-binding motifs in its N-terminal half and 2 transmembrane
domains in its C-terminal half. It also has 3 potential N-glycosylation
sites. Western blot analysis of transfected COS-7 cells detected
atlastin-1 at an apparent molecular mass of about 64 kD. Western blot
analysis detected high atlastin-1 expression in human and rat brain
homogenates, with much lower expression in several other human tissues,
including smooth muscle, adrenal gland, kidney, testis, and lung.
Immunohistochemical analysis of rat brain sections detected high
expression of atlastin-1 in cortical neurons of lamina V, pyramidal
neurons in CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus, and in amygdala and several
thalamic nuclei. Staining was most prominent in the cell soma, with
weaker staining of axons and dendrites. Immunogold labeling detected rat
atlastin-1 predominantly in the cis-Golgi cisternae. Protease protection
assays indicated that the N and C termini of human atlastin-1 were
exposed to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane in transfected cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Zhu et al. (2003) determined that
atlastin-1 self-associates. Chemical cross-linking experiments indicated
that atlastin-1 most likely forms a homotetramer of about 230 kD. Zhu et
al. (2003) demonstrated that atlastin-1 has GTPase activity.

Independently, Evans et al. (2006) and Sanderson et al. (2006)
demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of spastin (SPAST; 604277) bound
directly to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of atlastin, suggesting
that the 2 gene products interact in a common biologic pathway. Evans et
al. (2006) used yeast 2-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation
studies in HeLa cells, and Sanderson et al. (2006) used yeast 2-hybrid
analysis of a human fetal brain cDNA library and protein pull-down,
coimmunoprecipitation, and colocalization studies in HeLa cells, HEK293T
cells, and mouse NSC34 neuronal cells.

In the developing rat brain, Zhu et al. (2006) found that atlastin-1 was
expressed not only in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, but
was also enriched in axonal growth cones and growth cone-like
varicosities along the axons. Atlastin-1 labeling was prominent on
vesicular structures within the growth cones, but not at the plasma
membrane and not at synapses. Knockdown of atlastin-1 using shRNA in
cultured cortical cells inhibited axonal growth. Overall, the findings
suggested that atlastin-1 has diverse functions in neurons, likely
acting both in intracellular membrane trafficking as well as in
expansion at the axonal growth cone. These functional studies suggested
that the early-onset axonopathy observed in SPG3A may result from
abnormal development of axons.

Orso et al. (2009) demonstrated that Drosophila atlastin localizes on
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and that its loss causes ER
fragmentation. Drosophila atlastin embedded in distinct membranes has
the ability to form trans-oligomeric complexes, and its overexpression
induces enlargement of ER profiles, consistent with excessive fusion of
ER membranes. In vitro experiments confirmed that atlastin autonomously
drives membrane fusion in a GTP-dependent fashion. In contrast,
GTPase-deficient atlastin is inactive, unable to form trans-oligomeric
complexes owing to failure to self-associate, and incapable of promoting
fusion in vitro. The results of Orso et al. (2009) demonstrated that
atlastin mediates membrane tethering and fusion and strongly suggested
that it is the GTPase activity required for ER homotypic fusion.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhao et al. (2001) found that the ATL1 gene contains 14 exons and spans
approximately 69 kb.

MAPPING

Zhao et al. (2001) determined that the ATL1 gene maps to chromosome
14q11-q21. Zhu et al. (2003) stated that the ATL1 gene maps to
chromosome 14q22.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Spastic Paraplegia 3A

Zhao et al. (2001) identified mutations in the ATL1 gene (see, e.g.,
606439.0001) in families with spastic paraplegia-3A (SPG3A; 182600) in
which linkage to 14q11-q21 had been demonstrated as well as in other
phenotypically similar families without linkage evidence.

Durr et al. (2004) identified mutations in the ATL1 gene in 12 (39%) of
31 families with early-onset autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia. One
family showed incomplete penetrance.

Namekawa et al. (2006) stated that 19 mutations in the ATL1 gene had
been identified in 40 different families. More than 90% of the mutations
were located in exons 4 (12.5%), 7 (27.5%), 8 (17.5%), and 12 (35%).

In COS-7 cells, Zhu et al. (2006) showed that disease-associated
missense mutations in the ATL1 gene were expressed and interacted
strongly with wildtype ATL1, causing a decrease in GTPase activity in a
dominant-negative manner. The GTPase impairment was strongest with the
R217Q mutation (606439.0004), which is located within the GTPase binding
site, but was also observed with other missense mutations (R239C;
606439.0001 and H258R; 606439.0003), suggesting that these regions may
modulate activity.

Beetz et al. (2007) reported a family in which spastic paraplegia
segregated with a deletion of exon 1 of the SPAST gene (604277) in the
proband, her brother, and her 2 sons. Although the proband and her
brother also had a deletion of the ATL1 gene, the ATL1 deletion did not
segregate with the disorder in her sons and had no apparent effect on
the severity of the disorder. The findings suggested that
haploinsufficiency is the pathogenic mechanism for SPG4 (182601),
whereas a dominant-negative effect is the pathogenic mechanism for
SPG3A.

- Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy Type 1D

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by array-based exonic sequencing
of candidate genes, Guelly et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous
mutation in the ATL1 gene (N355K; 606439.0010) as a cause of autosomal
dominant hereditary neuropathy type 1D (HSN1D; 613708) in an affected
family. Screening of this gene in 115 additional probands with a similar
disorder identified 2 additional heterozygous mutations in the ATL1 gene
in 2 unrelated probands (606439.0011 and 606439.0012, respectively). The
phenotype was characterized by adult onset of a distal axonal sensory
neuropathy affecting all modalities, often associated with distal
ulceration and amputation as well as hyporeflexia, although some
patients showed features suggesting upper neuron involvement. In vitro
functional expression studies in COS7 cells did not reveal a common
pathogenetic mechanism, and there was no clear functional distinction
between mutations causing SPG3A and HSN1D, but Guelly et al. (2011)
postulated that a defect in the tubular endoplasmic reticulum may
underlie both disorders.

SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG239CYS

In affected members of 3 apparently unrelated kindreds with spastic
paraplegia-3 (182600), Zhao et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous
884C-T transition in exon 7 of the ATL1 gene, resulting in an
arg239-to-cys (R239C) substitution.

Abel et al. (2004) identified the R239C mutation in all 22 affected
members of a French family with SPG3 reported by Hazan et al. (1993).
Abel et al. (2004) stated that this was the seventh SPG3 family of
western European descent found to have the R239C mutation. Abel et al.
(2004) reported the nucleotide change as 715C-T, based on numbering from
the translation initiation codon, and noted that position 715 is within
a CpG doublet, suggesting that it is a possible mutation hotspot.

By haplotype analysis of 3 French families with the R239C mutation,
Namekawa et al. (2006) concluded that the mutations arose independently
and were not due to a founder effect. Further analysis confirmed that
the mutation occurred in a hotspot defined by a methylated CpG
dinucleotide.

.0002
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, SER259TYR

In a kindred designated ADHSP-P with early-onset autosomal dominant
spastic paraplegia (182600), Zhao et al. (2001) identified
heterozygosity (both C and A) at nucleotide 945 of the full-length ATL1
cDNA, corresponding to exon 8 of the gene. Unaffected members of the
family had only C at this position. This mutation, TCC (ser) to TAC
(tyr), was predicted to alter amino acid 259. Thus, this mutation,
S259Y, is adjacent to the H258R mutation (606439.0003).

.0003
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, HIS258ARG

Zhao et al. (2001) found that affected members in a kindred with
autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia of early onset (182600)
were heterozygous (A and G) at nucleotide position 942 of the
full-length cDNA corresponding to the ATL1 gene. Affected members in
this kindred had only C at this position. The mutation was predicted to
result in a his258-to-arg (H258R) amino acid substitution, at a site
adjacent to S259Y (606439.0002).

.0004
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG217GLN

In a large Italian family with early-onset, autosomal dominant
uncomplicated spastic paraplegia (182600), Muglia et al. (2002)
identified an 818G-A mutation in the ATL1 gene, resulting in an
arg217-to-gln substitution in a highly conserved GTPase motif.

.0005
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, 1-BP INS, 1688A

In an Italian family with autosomal dominant hereditary spastic
paraplegia (182600), Tessa et al. (2002) identified a heterozygous 1-bp
insertion, 1688A, in exon 12 of the ATL1 gene, producing a frameshift
and premature stop codon. The resulting protein lacked the last 37 amino
acids, including all of exon 14. Seven clearly affected individuals and
2 asymptomatic individuals with hyperreflexia carried the mutation. The
authors commented on the apparent age-dependent penetrance of the
disorder in this family.

.0006
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, MET408VAL

In a family with 6 members affected with a very early onset severe form
of spastic paraplegia (182600), Dalpozzo et al. (2003) identified a
heterozygous 1222A-G transition in exon 12 of the ATL1 gene, resulting
in a met408-to-val (M408V) substitution. All affected members had onset
in infancy with delayed motor milestones, gait impairment, spastic
paraparesis, distal atrophy, and lower limb weakness. Because of the
very early onset, the first patients were misdiagnosed with cerebral
palsy, and the index patient (mother of 5 affected members) was unaware
that she had a genetically transmissible disease. Two patients had the
unusual sign of mild hand atrophy.

.0007
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG415TRP

In all 3 affected members tested from an Italian family with SPG3A
(182600), D'Amico et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous mutation in
exon 12 of the atlastin gene, resulting in an arg415-to-trp (R415W)
substitution. The mutation was not identified in 400 control
chromosomes. The 3 patients had onset before 5 years of age, and 2
additional family members were reportedly affected by infantile-onset
spastic paraparesis. However, 9 asymptomatic relatives ranging in age
from 13 to 70 years also had the mutation. D'Amico et al. (2004)
concluded that the reduced penetrance of this mutation indicated that
modulator genes or epigenetic factors are involved in the development of
the disease, and they noted the implications for genetic counseling.

Varga et al. (2013) identified a heterozygous c.1243C-T transition in
the ATL1 gene resulting in an R415W substitution in affected members of
a family with SPG3A originally reported by Raggio et al. (1973) as
having a pure spastic paraplegia transmitted in an X-linked pattern of
inheritance. Whole-exome sequencing of 1 of the affected males
identified the heterozygous R415W substitution. This mutation was then
identified in 3 affected family members and in 3 unaffected family
members, consistent with incomplete penetrance. Two of the unaffected
carriers were women, and family history indicated that most unaffected
women were obligate carriers. These findings were consistent with
sex-associated reduced penetrance of this mutation. Varga et al. (2013)
identified the same mutation in 1 of 83 Spanish patients with apparent
sporadic HSP and in 2 of 28 Russian patients with dominant HSP. Evidence
again suggested incomplete penetrance in these families. Varga et al.
(2013) also identified a heterozygous c.1244A-G transition, resulting in
an arg415-to-gln (R415Q; 606439.0014) substitution, in a Moroccan family
with SPG3A and incomplete penetrance. Varga et al. (2013) noted that
both the c.1243C-T and c.1244A-G transitions occur at a CpG nucleotide
(on the plus and minus strands, respectively) and thus may represent a
mutation hotspot due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines.
R415 affects a highly conserved residue that does not localize to a
known protein domain.

.0008
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, LEU157TRP

In a mother and son with SPG3A (182600), Rainier et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 638T-C transition in exon 4 of the ATL1 gene,
resulting in a leu157-to-trp (L157W) substitution. The mutation is
predicted to disrupt a putative phosphorylation site of the protein.
Genetic analysis of family members indicated that the mutation occurred
de novo in the mother. The mother was a 34-year-old woman with
uncomplicated nonprogressive spastic paraplegia since infancy who was
originally diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. She was
correctly diagnosed with SPG after her son developed similar clinical
symptoms at age 10 months.

.0009
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, 3-BP DEL

In affected members of a large French Canadian family with SPG3A
(182600), Meijer et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 3-bp in-frame
deletion in the ATL1 gene, resulting in a deletion of asn436 (436delN).
Functional expression studies showed decreased ATL1 protein levels in
patients' lymphoblasts but normal levels of mRNA, normal GTPase
activity, and normal protein interactions. Meijer et al. (2007)
postulated decreased protein stability and a dominant-negative
loss-of-function mechanism.

.0010
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID
ATL1, ASN355LYS

In affected members of a large 4-generation family with autosomal
dominant hereditary sensory neuropathy type ID (HSN1D; 613708), Guelly
et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1065C-A transversion in exon 11
of the ATL1 gene, resulting in an asn355-to-lys (N355K) substitution.
The mutation was not found in 370 controls. The phenotype was
characterized by early adult onset of a severe distal st sensory axonal
neuropathy with frequent ulcerations and amputation digits. In vitro
functional expression studies in COS7 cells showed that the mutant
protein had decreased GTPase activity compared to wildtype, and caused
disruption of endoplasmic reticulum 3-way junctions.

.0011
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID
ATL1, GLU66GLN

In a 61-year-old man with hereditary sensory neuropathy-1D (HSN1D;
613708), Guelly et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 196G-C
transversion in exon 2 of the ATL1 gene, resulting in a glu66-to-gln
(E66Q) substitution. He presented with progressive, ascending, severe
sensory loss affecting all modalities in the lower legs, but no foot
ulcerations or paresis. He had hyporeflexia, and sural nerve biopsy
revealed a severe, chronic, axonal neuropathy with a moderate
demyelinating component. The patient's deceased mother reportedly had a
similar severe sensory neuropathy. The mutation was not found in 150
control individuals, but in vitro functional expression studies showed
no change in GTPase activity and no changes in endoplasmic reticulum
morphology.

.0012
NEUROPATHY, HEREDITARY SENSORY, TYPE ID
ATL1, 1-BP DEL, 976G

In a man with hereditary sensory neuropathy-1D (HSN1D; 613708), Guelly
et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1-bp deletion (976delG) in exon
9 of the ATL1 gene, resulting in premature termination in the C
terminus. The patient had adult-onset sensory neuropathy with
ulcerations, lack of pain perception, paresthesias in the fingers, and
occasional lancinating pains in his ankles. Patellar tendon reflexes
were brisk, and Achilles tendon reflexes were absent. His father and
brother were similarly affected. The mutation was not found in 334
control individuals. In vitro functional expression studies showed
decreased expression of the truncated protein and diffuse localization
throughout the cytoplasm instead of proper localization to the
endoplasmic reticulum.

.0013
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG416CYS

In affected members of a 3-generation South African Zulu family with
autosomal dominant SPG3A (182600), Orlacchio et al. (2011) identified a
heterozygous 1246C-T transition in exon 12 of the ATL1 gene, resulting
in an arg416-to-cys (R416C) substitution. The mutation was not found in
400 controls. The phenotype in this family was unusual in that affected
individuals had late onset (range 38 to 56 years), mild mental
retardation (IQ 32 to 67), and thin corpus callosum without cerebellar
involvement or white matter abnormalities. Spasticity was restricted to
the lower limbs; 3 patients had sphincter disturbances.

.0014
SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA 3, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT
ATL1, ARG415GLN

In 4 Moroccan sibs with SPG3A (182600), Varga et al. (2013) identified a
c.1244A-G transition in the ATL1 gene, resulting in an arg415-to-gln
(R415Q) substitution. Three sibs were homozygous and 1 was heterozygous
for the mutation. Heterozygosity for the mutation was then found in 3
unaffected family members and in 2 family members who had very subtle
signs of the disorder (hyperreflexia). These findings suggested complete
penetrance for the mutation in homozygous state and incomplete
penetrance for the mutation in heterozygous state. Varga et al. (2013)
also identified a heterozygous c.1243C-T transition, resulting in an
R415W (606439.0007) substitution in another family with SPG3A and
incomplete penetrance. Varga et al. (2013) noted that both the c.1243C-T
and c.1244A-G transitions occur at a CpG nucleotide (on the plus and
minus strands, respectively) and thus may represent a mutation hotspot
due to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines. R415 is a highly
conserved residue that does not localize to a known protein domain.
