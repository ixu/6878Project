DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TEKT2 and other members of the tektin protein family form filamentous
polymers in the walls of ciliary and flagellar microtubules (Iguchi et
al., 2002).

CLONING

Using mouse tektin-t to screen a human testis cDNA library, Iguchi et
al. (2002) cloned TEKT2, which they called tektin-t. The deduced
430-amino acid protein contains evolutionarily conserved tektin motifs
and 5 N-glycosylation sites. Human and mouse TEKT2 share 83% amino acid
identity. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.7-kb transcript expressed
strongly in testis and weakly in ovary. Western blot analysis of testis
showed a TEKT2 protein with an apparent molecular mass of 54 kD. In
sperm, a major protein of 56 kD, a minor protein of 46 kD, and a weakly
expressed protein of 54 kD were detected. The 56- and 54-kD proteins
bound concanavalin A, indicating that they were N-glycosylated, but the
46-kD protein did not. Immunostaining of human sperm revealed TEKT2
expressed in a discontinuous punctate pattern in the flagellum and in
the postacrosomal head region, with 2 positive spots in the tangential
view. A somewhat different staining pattern was found in mouse sperm.

By sequencing tryptic fragments of purified human TEKT2 protein,
followed by RT-PCR of testis mRNA and screening a testis cDNA library,
Wolkowicz et al. (2002) cloned TEKT2, which they called TEKB1. The
deduced 430-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 49.7
kD. TEKT2 contains a chaperonin signature motif, several
serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites, and 5
N-glycosylation sites. The central region of TEKT2 shares significant
similarity with sea urchin tektin B1, but the N and C termini differ.
Northern blot analysis detected a 1.5-kb transcript only in testis. RNA
dot blot analysis detected highest TEKT2 expression in testis, followed
by adult trachea and fetal lung. Weaker expression was detected in
ovary, pituitary, adult lung, fetal brain, and fetal kidney. SAGE data
indicated that TEKT2 was also expressed in cerebellum and mammary gland
tumors. Immunofluorescence analysis did not detect TEKT2 on the sperm
surface. In permeabilized sperm, TEKT2 localized to the principal piece
of the sperm flagellum, suggesting an axonemal location. TEKT2 was also
found at the base of the sperm head in a location corresponding to the
basal body.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wolkowicz et al. (2002) determined that the TEKT2 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 4.2 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and genomic sequence analysis, Iguchi et
al. (2002) mapped the TEKT2 gene to chromosome 1pter-p32.3. Wolkowicz et
al. (2002) also mapped the TEKT2 gene to chromosome 1pter-p32.3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Tanaka et al. (2004) found that Tekt2 null male mice were infertile, but
Tekt2 null female mice were fully fertile. Sperm morphology and function
were abnormal, with frequent bending of the sperm flagella and marked
defects in motility. In vitro fertilization assays showed that the
defective spermatozoa were able to fertilize eggs. However, electron
microscopic examination showed that the dynein inner arm structure was
disrupted. Homozygous mutant mice also had functionally defective
tracheal cilia with altered dynein arm morphology. Tanaka et al. (2004)
concluded that TEKT2 participates in dynein inner arm formation or
attachment and that the loss of TEKT2 results in impaired motility of
both flagella and cilia.

602313	TITLE *602313 OVO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG-LIKE, 1; OVOL1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

A critical role in Drosophila oogenesis and germline sex differentiation
is played by ovo, a female germline-specific nuclear protein.
Chidambaram et al. (1997) noted that homozygous ovo mutants result in
female germ cell degeneration and revertants of dominant ovo mutations
can result in shaven baby (svb) and lozenge-like (lzl) phenotypes that
affect cuticle (epidermal/locomotor) and eye (sensory) development,
respectively, suggesting a tight structural link between ovo and svb.
Human OVOL1, which contains an open reading frame with zinc finger
domains, is similar to Drosophila ovo and is conserved in C. elegans as
well. An EST database search suggested the presence of ovo-related
sequences in both the mouse and the human genome.

MAPPING

The human OVOL1 gene maps to 11q13, less than 200 kb proximal to the
oncogene SEA (165110) (Debelenko et al., 1997). Comparative mapping data
indicated that the mouse Ovol1 locus is located on MMU 19.

601529	TITLE *601529 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR SUBFAMILY 2, GROUP C, MEMBER 1; NR2C1
;;NUCLEAR HORMONE RECEPTOR TR2; TR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chang and Kokontis (1988) used an oligonucleotide probe based on the
zinc finger DNA-binding domain of steroid receptors to isolate a
putative steroid receptor, termed TR2, from a human testis cDNA library.
Subsequent studies (Chang et al., 1989) showed that several splice
variants of TR2 exist and the original TR2 clone was renamed TR2-5.
Northern blot analysis by Chang and Kokontis (1988) showed that TR2-5
produced a 2.5-kb transcript that was abundant in androgen-sensitive
organs, such as ventral prostate and seminal vesicle. Dot blot
hybridization indicated that TR2-5 mRNA levels increased after
castration of rats and that this increase was reversed by
5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone injection. Expression of TR2-5 resulted in a
52-kD protein.

Chang et al. (1989) described 4 splice variants of the TR2 gene, TR2-5,
TR2-7, TR2-9, and TR2-11, which encode proteins of 483, 184, 467, and
603 amino acids, respectively. All were isolated from human testis or
prostate cDNA libraries. The DNA-binding domains of the 4 variants are
identical and share 50 to 60% amino acid identity with other steroid
receptors. The TR2-7 receptor has no apparent hormone-binding region,
whereas the other 3 variants have the same hormone-binding region
followed by variant C termini. In vitro transcription and translation of
the TR2-11 receptor indicated that this receptor did not bind any known
steroids, suggesting to Chang et al. (1989) that this receptor could be
steroid independent or dependent on an unknown hormone. The authors
noted that the identity of the DNA-binding regions of these receptors
suggests that they regulate the same target gene(s), but the differences
in the C termini may allow them to bind different ligands or bind the
same ligand with differing affinities. By analogy to the splice variants
of the thyroid hormone receptor, the authors suggested that the
expression ratio of the TR2 splice variants could vary in a
tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific manner regulated at the
level of RNA splicing.

GENE FUNCTION

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Lee et al. (1998) identified an
interaction between mouse Tr2 and Rip140 (NRIP1; 602490). By mutation
analysis, they determined that the LxxLL motifs of mouse Rip140
interacted with the activation function-2 region of Tr2.
Coimmunoprecipitation experiments detected interaction between the 2
proteins in cell extracts. Rip140 repressed binding of Tr2 to target
DNA. In the presence of Rip140, Tr2 translocated into the nucleus.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the NR2C1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP STS-H68838).

ANIMAL MODEL

Shyr et al. (2002) detected Tr2 expression in mice at 3 weeks of age,
and the expression was restricted mainly to spermatocytes and round
spermatids. They found that mice lacking Tr2 were viable with no serious
developmental defects. Male mice lacking Tr2 had functional testes,
including normal sperm number and motility, and both male and female
mice lacking Tr2 were fertile.

604790	TITLE *604790 TASTE RECEPTOR, TYPE 2, MEMBER 14; TAS2R14
;;T2R14;;
TASTE RECEPTOR, FAMILY B, MEMBER 1; TRB1
DESCRIPTION For background information on the TAS2R gene family, see 604791.

CLONING

Matsunami et al. (2000) used in silico methods to identify a family of
candidate taste receptors that are members of the G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR) superfamily and that are specifically expressed in taste
receptor cells. Using the TRB2 sequence to search the human chromosome
12 database, Matsunami et al. (2000) identified TRB1 and 7 other related
genes, all in the same contig. Two of these were pseudogenes. Matsunami
et al. (2000) identified the TRB7 gene (604796) in a contig assigned to
human chromosome 5p15, the location of PROP (171200), the genetic locus
that governs the ability of humans to taste 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil, a
bitter compound. Matsunami et al. (2000) also identified 5 TRB genes (1
a pseudogene) on 3 chromosome 7 contigs, 2 of which are assigned to
7q31-q32. All TRB genes have the 7 transmembrane domain structure
characteristic of GPCRs, but lack a long extracellular N-terminal domain
proposed to bind ligand, suggesting that they use a different mode of
ligand binding. Matsunami et al. (2000) concluded that the TRBs are
diverse in protein sequence, which is consistent with an ability to
detect a variety of tastants with very different chemical structures.

GENE FUNCTION

Kinnamon (2000) reviewed the role of taste receptors in taste
transduction.

Deshpande et al. (2010) found that bitter taste receptor agonists evoked
increased intracellular calcium in cultured human airway smooth muscle
(ASM) cells at levels comparable to GPCR agonists, such as bradykinin
and histamine. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected multiple TAS2R
transcripts in ASM cells, with highest expression of TAS2R10 (604791),
TAS2R14, and TAS2R31 (612669), intermediate expression of TAS2R5
(605062), TAS2R4 (604869), and TAS2R19 (613961), and detectable
expression of 11 other TAS2Rs, with results normalized for expression of
ADRB2 (109690). Expression of 8 other TAS2Rs and TAS1R1 (606225) and
TAS1R2 (606226) was undetectable. Using isolated intact mouse airways,
Deshpande et al. (2010) observed dose-dependent relaxation in response
to bitter taste receptor agonists, such as chloroquine, denatorium, and
quinine, after challenge with contracting agents, such as acetylcholine
or serotonin. Magnet twisting cytometry showed that isolated ASM cells
challenged with histamine relaxed after treatment with bitter taste
receptor agonists. Bitter taste receptor agonists were a more effective
treatment than albuterol in a mouse model of allergic airway
inflammation. Deshpande et al. (2010) proposed that agents that bind
bitter taste receptors and cause bronchodilation may provide an
alternative and/or supplement to beta agonist for the treatment of
asthma.

GENE FAMILY

Adler et al. (2000) identified members of a family of 40 to 80 human and
rodent GPCRs expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells of the tongue
and palate epithelia. These candidate taste receptors, which the authors
called T2Rs, are organized in the genome in clusters and are genetically
linked to loci that influence bitter perception in mice and humans. Each
T2R gene encodes a 7-transmembrane receptor protein. The amino acid
sequence identities between human and mouse T2Rs range from 46 to 67%.
The authors determined that a single taste receptor cell expresses a
large repertoire of T2Rs, suggesting that each cell may be capable of
recognizing multiple tastants. In situ hybridization demonstrated that
T2Rs are exclusively expressed in taste receptor cells that contain the
G protein subunit gustducin (139395), implying that they function as
gustducin-linked receptors.

Chandrashekar et al. (2006) reviewed the receptors and cells for
mammalian taste.

MAPPING

Matsunami et al. (2000) identified the TAS2R14 gene on chromosome 12p13.

Adler et al. (2000) identified T2R14, which is identical to the TRB1
gene reported by Matsunami et al. (2000), in a BAC clone from 12p13.

611123	TITLE *611123 EPHRIN RECEPTOR EphA10; EPHA10
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ephrin receptors, the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs), and their ephrin ligands are important mediators of cell-cell
communication regulating cell attachment, shape, and mobility in
neuronal and epithelial cells (Aasheim et al., 2005). See 179610 for
additional background on Eph receptors and ephrins.

CLONING

By database analysis, Robinson et al. (2000) identified EPHA10. By
further database analysis and PCR of a testis cDNA library, Aasheim et
al. (2005) cloned EPHA10 and identified 3 isoforms. A 295-amino acid
soluble secreted Eph receptor (EphA10s) contains the Eph receptor
ligand-binding domain but lacks fibronectin III repeats. Full-length
EphA10 is composed of 1008 predicted amino acids, the first 283 of which
are identical to EphA10s, and its sequence predicts the canonic Eph
receptor structure containing an Eph ligand-binding domain, 2
fibronectin III repeats, an intracellular conserved kinase domain, and a
SAM domain. The third isoform, EphA10*, lacks the SAM domain. EPHA10
shares 91% amino acid identity with its mouse ortholog. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected expression in testis only. Binding
studies with EphA10s showed strong binding to EFNA3 (601381), EFNA4
(601380) and EFNA5 (601535), but weak binding to EFNB1 (300035) and
EFNB2 (600527).

GENE STRUCTURE

Aasheim et al. (2005) determined that the EPHA10 gene contains 17 exons.
Alternative splicing of exons 3 and 15 results in a soluble isoform
EphA10s, which contains only the first 3 exons, and an isoform lacking
the SAM domain, which they called EphA10*.

MAPPING

Aasheim et al. (2005) noted that the EPHA10 gene maps to chromosome
1p34.3.

605453	TITLE *605453 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 9; ABCB9
DESCRIPTION For background information on the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of
transporter proteins, see ABCA4 (601691). In addition to the 'full' ABC
transporters with 2 transmembrane domains and 2 nucleotide-binding
domains, there are 'half' proteins that contain only 1 of each domain
(e.g., ABCB1; 171050). Full transporters are usually found in the plasma
membrane, whereas half transporters are found in subcellular organelles.

By searching an EST database and screening a T-lymphoblast cDNA library,
Zhang et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA encoding ABCB9. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 766-amino acid ABCB9 protein has 10 potential
N-terminal transmembrane segments. ABCB9 shares 94% identity with the
rodent sequences and is approximately 39% identical to 2 human
endoplasmic reticulum half transporters, TAP1 (ABCB2; 170260) and TAP2
(ABCB3; 170261). RT-PCR and genomic sequence analysis established the
existence of a splice variant with a 129-bp deletion expressed in testis
and brain. Northern blot analysis detected low expression of a 3.7-kb
transcript in most tissues tested, with an additional 2.2-kb transcript
detected in tissues with relatively high expression, such as testis.
Western blot analysis showed expression of a 72-kD nonglycosylated
protein, significantly smaller than the predicted mass of 84.5 kD, that
was enriched in lysosomes. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of ABCB9 with the lysosomal proteins LAMP1 (153330) and
LAMP2 (309060). Immunohistochemical analysis detected ABCB9 expression
in Sertoli cells of rodent seminiferous tubules.

Allikmets et al. (1996) mapped an EST corresponding to the ABCB9 gene to
12q24.

180231	TITLE *180231 RETINOIC ACID-BINDING PROTEIN, CELLULAR, TYPE II; CRABP2
DESCRIPTION CRABP2 is highly expressed in human skin. Giguere et al. (1990) isolated
a cDNA encoding mouse Crabp-2 by a low stringency cloning strategy using
a probe from previously cloned CRABP1 cDNA (180230). MacGregor et al.
(1992) determined the genomic organization of the murine Crabp-2 gene
and performed a detailed analysis of its transcriptional unit. It was
shown to be approximately 4.6 kb long and divided into 4 exons in a
structure common to other members of the family of serum and cellular
retinoid-binding proteins. The chromosomal location of the Crabp-2 locus
was determined by interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived
from matings of C57BL/6J and M. spretus. Mapping results indicated that
the gene is located on mouse chromosome 2 linked to muscle nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor alpha-chain (Acra) and catalase-1 (Cas-1).
MacGregor et al. (1992) suggested that the human homolog is located on
2q or 11p. Elder et al. (1992) localized the CRABP2 gene to 1q21 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Localization was confirmed by
hybridization of a CRABP2 cDNA clone against a human/mouse hybrid cell
line containing a t(1;6)(q21;q13) translocation chromosome.

Flagiello et al. (1997) mapped CRABP2 to 1q21.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

CALCIUM CHELATE TRANSPORTER; CCT;;
CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 58; C14ORF58
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The FLVCR2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that belongs to the
major facilitator superfamily of secondary carriers that transport small
solutes in response to chemiosmotic ion gradients, such as calcium
(summary by Meyer et al., 2010).

CLONING

By searching databases for sequences similar to FLVCR1 (609144),
Lipovich et al. (2002) identified FLVCR2, which they called FLVCRL14q.
The deduced 527-amino acid protein contains 12 transmembrane domains and
the N- and C-terminal domains are cytoplasmic. A splice variant, in
which exon 1 is directly spliced to exon 9, encodes a putative 83-amino
acid protein that lacks all transmembrane domains.

Brasier et al. (2004) used a rat cDNA for a calcitonin (114130)-like
receptor to design 5-prime and 3-prime RACE primers, and they cloned 4
CCT transcripts from a human pituitary cDNA library. All transcripts
encode a deduced 526-amino acid protein that has an N-terminal hexad
repeat, 6 extracellular loops, and a C-terminal polyglutamate sequence.
EST analysis detected CCT in brain, heart, kidney, lung, placenta,
uterus, cervix, prostate, testis, germ cells, and whole fetus.
Immunofluorescence analysis of human pituitary detected CCT
predominantly in acidophils. Brasier et al. (2004) also identified 3 Cct
transcripts in mouse, which encode a deduced 551-amino acid protein. In
developing rat, Cct expression was restricted to osteoclasts,
chondrocytes, thyroid, pituitary, central nervous system, eye, liver,
kidney, and heart, and in mouse, intraplacental yolk sac showed Cct
expression. In mouse and rat kidney, Cct was expressed in the distal
portions of nephrons and collecting ducts.

By searching a database for sequences similar to FLVCR1, followed by PCR
of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line cDNA library, Brown et al. (2006) cloned
FLVCR2, which encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 60
kD. It has 3 potential N-glycosylation motifs. Western blot analysis
detected FLVCR2 proteins at 55 kD and 40 kD. However, N-glycosidase
treatment did not alter the molecular mass of the larger protein.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Duffy et al. (2010) detected variable
FLVCR2 expression in all human tissues examined, with highest expression
in placenta, followed by adult and fetal liver.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lipovich et al. (2002) determined that the FLVCR2 gene contains 10
exons. The transcription start site is within a predicted CpG island,
and there are 2 polyadenylation signals at the 3-prime end.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Brasier et al. (2004) mapped the FLVCR2
gene to chromosome 14q24.3. They mapped the mouse Flvcr2 gene to
chromosome 12.

EVOLUTION

Lipovich et al. (2002) identified genes, including the FLVCR1-FLVCR2
paralogs, involved in a chromosome 1q/14q block duplication.
Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the duplication occurred early
within or immediately prior to the divergence of the vertebrate lineage,
between the protostome-deuterostome and amniote-amphibian divergences.

GENE FUNCTION

Infection of cells by the highly anemogenic feline leukemia virus
subgroup C (FeLV-C) is mediated by the binding of FeLV-C envelope
protein to FLVCR1. By assaying transfected mouse cells, Brown et al.
(2006) determined that, unlike FLVCR1, FLVCR2 does not bind FeLV-C
envelope protein. However, an asn463-to-asp mutation rendered FLVCR2
functional as an FeLV-C receptor.

Duffy et al. (2010) found that both human FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 bound
immobilized heme. Using hamster or human cell lines and Xenopus oocytes,
they confirmed that overexpression of human FLVCR1 resulted in heme
export, but in contrast, overexpression of FLVCR2 resulted in heme
import. Overexpression of FLVCR2 also rendered transfected cells more
sensitive to heme toxicity. Downregulation of FLVCR2 via small
interfering RNA inhibited heme import. Duffy et al. (2010) concluded
that FLVCR2 functions in heme import.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By genomewide linkage analysis, followed by candidate gene sequencing,
Meyer et al. (2010) identified a homozygous mutation in the FLVCR2 gene
(T430R; 610865.0001) in 5 fetuses with proliferative vasculopathy and
hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (PVHH; 225790) from 3
consanguineous Pakistani families. The disorder is also known as Fowler
syndrome. Two additional fetuses of Northern European origin with the
disorder were each found to be compound heterozygous for 2 mutations in
the FLVCR2 gene (610865.0002-610865.0005). Meyer et al. (2010) suggested
that the disorder may involve defects in proliferation and motility of
vascular endothelial cells in the brain, which are calcium-dependent
events.

Using exome sequencing, Lalonde et al. (2010) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FLVCR2 gene (610865.0006 and
610865.0007) in a fetus with proliferative vasculopathy and
hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome.

By genomewide linkage analysis followed by high-throughput sequencing of
7 families with Fowler syndrome, Thomas et al. (2010) identified
homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations affecting the FLVCR2 gene
(see, e.g., Y134X; 610865.0008). Two of the families, of Turkish origin,
carried a large deletion. The patients and families had previously been
reported by Bessieres-Grattagliano et al. (2009).

In 5 fetuses with proliferative vasculopathy and
hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (PVHH; 225790) from 3
consanguineous Pakistani families, Meyer et al. (2010) identified a
homozygous 1289C-G transversion in exon 7 of the FLVCR2 gene, resulting
in a thr430-to-arg (T430R) substitution in a highly conserved region in
an intracellular loop of the protein. The mutation was not found in 646
control chromosomes.

In a fetus of Northern European origin with proliferative vasculopathy
and hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (225790), Meyer et al. (2010)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FLVCR2 gene: a
6-bp deletion (329_334del) in exon 1, and a 1192C-G transversion in exon
6, resulting in a leu398-to-val (L398V; 610865.0003) substitution. The
6-bp deletion removed 3 conserved amino acids (asn110 to phe 112) and
introduced an isoleucine residue in the predicted first extracellular
loop (Asn110_Phe112delinsIle). The L398V substitution occurred in a
highly conserved residue in close proximity to transmembrane domain-9
(TM9). Neither mutation was found in at least 936 control chromosomes.
Lalonde et al. (2010) identified the same compound heterozygous
mutations in a second affected fetus from the family reported by Meyer
et al. (2010).

In a fetus, born of French Canadian parents, with proliferative

et al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the
FLVCR2 gene: a 997C-T transition in exon 4, resulting in an
ala326-to-val (A326V) substitution at the end of the sixth transmembrane
domain (TM6), and a T-to-C transition in intron 7 (1341+2T-C;
610865.0007), predicted to result in the skipping of exon 7 or retention
of intron 7, disrupting the tenth transmembrane domain (TM10) and
potentially resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The parents had
previously lost a fetus with a similar phenotype, but no DNA sample was
available for study.

FLVCR2 gene, resulting in a tyr134-to-ter (Y134X) substitution in
transmembrane domain-2 (TM2). The sibs had macrocrania, limb
contractures, hydrocephlus, and thin cerebral walls with characteristic

603805	TITLE *603805 TRANSGLUTAMINASE 5; TGM5
;;TRANSGLUTAMINASE X; TGX
DESCRIPTION Transglutaminases (EC 2.3.2.13) represent a family of enzymes capable of
stabilizing protein assemblies by gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine
crosslinks. For additional background information about
transglutaminases, see TGM1 (190195).

CLONING

By RT-PCR of keratinocyte mRNA with degenerate primers based on the
conserved transglutaminase active-site region, Aeschlimann et al. (1998)
isolated a partial cDNA encoding a novel member of this family, TGM5,
which they designated transglutaminase X (TGX). Using anchored PCR, the
authors cloned additional cDNAs encoding 2 TGX isoforms: a long
720-amino acid form and a short 638-amino acid form. The long form
contains an insert in the N-terminal region. Grenard et al. (2001)
identified the 2 isoforms as products of alternative gene splicing.
Aeschlimann et al. (1998) found that TGM5 contains the conserved
structural requirements for transglutaminase activity and calcium
binding. Overall, TGM5 shares 40%, 42%, 35%, and 31% protein sequence
identity with TGC (TGM2; 190196), TGE (TGM3; 600238), TGK (TGM1;
190195), and TGP (TGM4; 600585), respectively. Northern blot analysis
revealed that TGM5 is expressed as 2.2- and 2.8-kb mRNAs in foreskin
keratinocytes. By Northern dot blot analysis, Grenard et al. (2001)
found ubiquitous expression of TGM5, with highest levels in the female
reproductive system, skeletal muscle, and fetal tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Aeschlimann et al. (1998) found that expression of TGM5 increased
severalfold when keratinocyte cultures were induced to differentiate by
suspension or growth to postconfluency. They suggested that TGM5
contributes to the formation of the cornified cell envelope of
keratinocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grenard et al. (2001) determined that the TGM5 gene contains 13 exons
and spans about 35 kb. They identified a number of potential
transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region but no classic
TATA box.

MAPPING

By FISH, Grenard et al. (2001) mapped the TGM5 gene to chromosome
15q15.2. Using long-range genomic PCR, they found that TGM5 is part of a
tandemly arranged cluster of TGM genes, including EPB42 (177070) and
TGM7 (606776), in a 100-kb region. By radiation hybrid analysis, they
mapped the mouse Tgm5, Tgm7, and Epb42 genes in close proximity in a
region of syntenic homology on chromosome 2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Peeling skin syndrome (270300) is an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by the continuous shedding of the outer layers of the
epidermis from birth and throughout life. In some families, an acral
form of peeling skin syndrome (609796) has been reported, in which skin
peeling is strictly limited to the dorsa of the hands and the feet;
ultrastructural and histologic analysis showed a level of blistering
high in the epidermis at the stratum granulosum-stratum corneum junction
(Shwayder et al., 1997; Hashimoto et al., 2000). Cassidy et al. (2005)
mapped a gene for acral peeling skin syndrome to 15q15.2 and identified
the same loss-of-function mutation in homozygous state in the TGM5 gene
in 2 unrelated families (603805.0001).

Cassidy et al. (2005) excluded the TGM5 locus in a large, consanguineous
kindred of Middle Eastern origin with more widespread peeling skin and,
in addition, failed to detect TGM5 mutations in 3 small, outbred
families with widespread peeling skin phenotypes. In all these families,
onset was in infancy and the phenotype was similar to the classic,
generalized form of peeling skin syndrome.

PEELING SKIN SYNDROME, ACRAL TYPE
TGM5, GLY113CYS

Cassidy et al. (2005) described a homozygous missense mutation in exon 3
of the TGM5 gene in members of 2 unrelated families, 1 Dutch and 1
Scottish, who suffered from the acral form of peeling skin syndrome
(609796). A gly113-to-cys (G113C) mutation arose from a 337G-to-T
transversion. In fact, 2 homozygous missense mutations were found;
evidence was presented that one was a rare polymorphism and that G113C
was the pathogenic change.

600778	TITLE *600778 CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE INHIBITOR 1B; CDKN1B
;;p27(KIP1);;
KIP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDKN1B, or p27(KIP1), is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that blocks
the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase upon differentiation signals or
cellular insult. CDKN1B also regulates cell motility and apoptosis
(summary by Cuesta et al., 2009).

CLONING

Using a cDNA probe amplified from the MV1Lu mink cell line to screen a
kidney cDNA library, Polyak et al. (1994) cloned human CDKN1B, which
they called KIP1. The deduced 198-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 22.3 kD. It has a 60-amino acid N-terminal domain that
shares 44% identity with the corresponding region of CIP1/WAF1 (CDKN1A;
116899). It also has a C-terminal bipartite nuclear localization signal
and a consensus CDC2 (CDK1; 116940) phosphorylation site. KIP1 shares
about 90% amino acid identity with mink and mouse Kip1, with highest
identity in the N-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of a 2.5-kb transcript in all human tissues
examined.

Stegmaier et al. (1995) studied loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the
region 12p13-p12 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia; this chromosomal
region often shows deletion in such patients. In 15% of informative
patients, there was evidence of LOH of the TEL locus (600618) which was
not evident on cytogenetic analysis. Detailed examination of patients
with LOH showed that the critically deleted region included a second
candidate tumor suppressor gene, referred to by them as KIP1, which
encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor previously called p27
(Toyoshima and Hunter, 1994 and Polyak et al., 1994). Based on the STS
content of TEL-positive YACs, Stegmaier et al. (1995) reported that KIP1
and TEL were in close proximity.

GENE FUNCTION

Polyak et al. (1994) showed that recombinant mouse Kip1 inhibited
phosphorylation of histone H1 (see 142709) by human cyclin A (see CCNA1;
604036)-CDK2 (116953), cyclin E (CCNE1; 123837)-CDK2, and cyclin B1
(CCNB1; 123836)-CDK2 complexes. Addition of Kip1 also inhibited
phosphorylation of RB (614041) by cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin A-CDK2, and
cyclin D2 (CCND2; 123833)-CDK4 (123829). The isolated N-terminal domain
of Kip1 had similar inhibitory activity in these assays. Kip1 bound to
preactivated cyclin E-CDK2 complexes and prevented phosphorylation and
activation of CDK2 in A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Kip1 activity was
lowest in S phase in MV1Lu cells, and Kip1 overexpression inhibited S
phase entry. Kip1 mRNA content remained unchanged during the cell cycle,
suggesting that Kip1 activity was controlled at a posttranscriptional
level. Polyak et al. (1994) concluded that KIP1 can inhibit both CDK
activation and the kinase activity of assembled and activated
cyclin-CDK.

CDK activation requires association with cyclins and phosphorylation by
CAK (CCNH; 601953) and leads to cell proliferation. Inhibition of
cellular proliferation occurs upon association of CDK inhibitor (e.g.,
CDKN1B) with a cyclin-CDK complex. Sheaff et al. (1997) showed that
expression of CCNE1-CDK2 at physiologic levels of ATP resulted in
phosphorylation of CDKN1B at thr187, leading to elimination of CDKN1B
from the cell and progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S phase. At
low ATP levels, the inhibitory functions of CDKN1B were enhanced,
thereby arresting cell proliferation.

Apoptosis of human endothelial cells after growth factor deprivation is
associated with rapid and dramatic upregulation of cyclin A (see
604036)-associated CDK2 activity. Levkau et al. (1998) showed that in
apoptotic cells the carboxyl-termini of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and
CDKN1B are truncated by specific cleavage. The enzyme involved in this
cleavage is CASP3 (600636) and/or a CASP3-like caspase. After cleavage,
CDKN1A loses its nuclear localization sequence and exits the nucleus.
Cleavage of CDKN1A and CDKN1B resulted in a substantial reduction in
their association with nuclear cyclin-CDK2 complexes, leading to a
dramatic induction of CDK2 activity. Dominant-negative CDK2, as well as
a mutant CDKN1A resistant to caspase cleavage, partially suppressed
apoptosis. These data suggested that CDK2 activation, through
caspase-mediated cleavage of CDK inhibitors, may be instrumental in the
execution of apoptosis following caspase activation.

High levels of p27(KIP1), present in quiescent (G0) cells, have been
shown to decline upon mitogen induction (Sherr and Roberts, 1995).
Braun-Dullaeus et al. (1999) explored the role of p27(KIP1) and other
cell cycle proteins in mediating angiotensin II (see 106150)-induced
vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy or hyperplasia. Angiotensin II
treatment (100 nM) of quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells led to
upregulation of the cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1 (168461),
CDK2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (176740), and CDK1. Levels of
p27(KIP1), however, remained high, and the activation of the G1-phase
CDK2 was inhibited as the cells underwent hypertrophy. Angiotensin II
stimulated an increase in [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and the
percentage of S-phase cells in p27(KIP1) antisense oligodeoxynucleotide
(ODN)-transfected cells but not in control ODN transfected cells. The
authors concluded that angiotensin II stimulation of quiescent cells in
which p27(KIP1) levels are high results in hypertrophy but promotes
hyperplasia when levels of p27(KIP1) are low, as in the presence of
other growth factors.

Medema et al. (2000) demonstrated that p27(KIP1) is a major target of
AFX-like forkhead proteins. They demonstrated that AFX integrates
signals from PI3K/PKB (see AKT1; 164730) signaling and RAS (see
190020)/RAL (see 179551) signaling to regulate transcription of
p27(KIP1). They demonstrated that p27 -/- cells are significantly less
inhibited by AFX activity than their p27 +/+ counterparts.

Dijkers et al. (2002) showed that both cytokine withdrawal and Fkhrl1
(FOXO3A; 602681) activation induced apoptosis in mammalian cell lines
through a death receptor-independent pathway. This involved
transcriptional upregulation of p27(KIP1) and proapoptotic Bim (BCL2L11;
603827), loss of mitochondrial integrity, cytochrome c release, and
caspase activation. PKB protected cells from cytokine withdrawal-induced
apoptosis by inhibiting Fkhrl1, resulting in the maintenance of
mitochondrial integrity.

Peters and Ostrander (2001) commented on the work of Di Cristofano et
al. (2001), demonstrating how cooperation between Cdkn1b and Pten
(601728) contribute to suppression of prostate tumors. They gave a
useful tabulation of the cytogenetic location of 16 mapped prostate
cancer susceptibility loci and candidate genes.

Phosphorylation leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of CDKN1B.
Carrano et al. (1999) determined that SKP2 (601436) specifically
recognizes phosphorylated CDKN1B predominantly in S phase rather than in
G1 phase, and is the ubiquitin-protein ligase necessary for CDKN1B
ubiquitination.

Shin et al. (2002) demonstrated a novel mechanism of AKT-mediated
regulation of p27(KIP1). Blockade of HER2/NEU (164870) in tumor cells
inhibited AKT kinase activity and upregulated nuclear levels of
p27(KIP1). Recombinant AKT and AKT precipitated from tumor cells
phosphorylated wildtype p27 in vitro. P27 contains an AKT consensus
RXRXXT(157)D within its nuclear localization motif. Active
(myristoylated) AKT phosphorylated wildtype p27 in vivo but was unable
to phosphorylate a T157A-p27 mutant. Wildtype p27 localized in the
cytosol and nucleus, whereas the mutant p27 localized exclusively in the
nucleus and was resistant to nuclear exclusion by AKT. Expression of
phosphorylated AKT in primary human breast cancers statistically
correlated with the expression of p27 in tumor cytosol. Shin et al.
(2002) concluded that AKT may contribute to tumor cell proliferation by
phosphorylation and cytosolic retention of p27, thus relieving CDK2 from
p27-induced inhibition.

Liang et al. (2002) demonstrated that AKT phosphorylates p27, impairs
the nuclear import of p27, and opposes cytokine-mediated G1 arrest. In
cells transfected with constitutively active AKT, wildtype p27
mislocalized to the cytoplasm, but mutant p27 was nuclear. In cells with
activated AKT, wildtype p27 failed to cause G1 arrest, while the
antiproliferative effect of the mutant p27 was not impaired. Cytoplasm
p27 was seen in 41% (52 of 128) primary human breast cancers in
conjunction with AKT activation and was correlated with a poor patient
prognosis. Liang et al. (2002) concluded that their data showed a novel
mechanism whereby AKT impairs p27 function that is associated with an
aggressive phenotype in human breast cancer.

Viglietto et al. (2002) independently demonstrated that AKT regulates
cell proliferation in breast cancer cells by preventing
p27(KIP1)-mediated growth arrest. They also showed that threonine at
position 157 is an AKT phosphorylation site and causes retention of
p27(KIP1) in the cytoplasm, precluding p27(KIP1)-induced G1 arrest.

Gopfert et al. (2003) analyzed fragments of the p27 transcript for their
contribution to cell cycle-regulated translation. An element in the p27
5-prime UTR rendered reporter translation cell cycle-sensitive with
maximal translation in G1-arrested cells. The 114-bp element contained a
G/C-rich hairpin domain that was predicted to form multiple stable
stemloops and also overlapped with a small upstream open reading frame
(ORF). Both structures contributed to cell cycle-regulated translation.
The upstream ORF could be translated in vitro, and its sequence and
position were evolutionarily conserved in mouse and chicken. The precise
sequence or length of the upstream ORF-encoded peptide were not
important for p27 translation, suggesting that ribosomal recruitment to
its initiation codon, rather than the translation product itself,
contributes to the regulation.

Using NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Kamura
et al. (2004) found that Skp2 was the major ubiquitin ligase involved in
ubiquitination of nuclear p27(KIP1) at the S and G2 phases, and that a
complex made up of Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472) and Kpc2 (UBAC1; 608129)
ubiquitinated cytoplasmic p27(KIP1) at G1 phase. Cytoplasmic degradation
of p27(KIP1) required p27(KIP1) nuclear export by Crm1 (XPO1; 602559).

The inverse relationship between proliferation and differentiation in
osteoblasts has been well documented. Thomas et al. (2004) found that
Runx2 (600211), a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation in
mammalian cells, was disrupted in 6 of 7 mammalian osteosarcoma cell
lines. Immunohistochemical analysis of human osteosarcomas indicated
that expression of p27(KIP1) was also lost as tumors lost osteogenic
differentiation. Thomas et al. (2004) found that ectopic expression of
Runx2 induced growth arrest through p27(KIP1)-induced inhibition of
S-phase cyclin complexes, followed by dephosphorylation of RB1 (614041)
and G1 cell cycle arrest. They concluded that RUNX2 establishes a
terminally differentiated state in osteoblasts through RB1- and
p27(KIP1)-dependent mechanisms that are disrupted in osteosarcomas.

White et al. (2006) showed that postmitotic supporting cells purified
from the postnatal mouse cochlea retain the ability to divide and
trans-differentiate into new hair cells in culture. Furthermore, they
demonstrated that age-dependent changes in supporting cell proliferative
capacity are due in part to changes in the ability to downregulate
p27(Kip1). White et al. (2006) concluded that postnatal mammalian
supporting cells are potential targets for therapeutic manipulation.

Grimmler et al. (2007) found that a conserved tyrosine (Y88) in the
CDK-inhibitory domain of human p27 could be phosphorylated by the Src
family kinase LYN (165120) and the oncogene product BCR-ABL (see
189980). Phosphorylation of Y88 did not prevent binding of p27 to cyclin
A/CDK2, but it caused phosphorylated Y88 and the inhibitory domain of
p27 to be ejected from the CDK2 active site, restoring partial CDK
activity. This allowed Y88-phosphorylated p27 to be efficiently
phosphorylated on thr187 by CDK2, which in turn promoted its
SCF-SKP2-dependent degradation.

Chu et al. (2007) showed that the oncogenic kinase SRC (190090)
phosphorylated human p27 at Y74 and Y88. SRC inhibitors increased
cellular p27 stability, whereas SRC overexpression accelerated p27
proteolysis. SRC-phosphorylated p27 inhibited cyclin E/CDK2 poorly in
vitro, and SRC transfection reduced p27/cyclin E/CDK2 complexes.
SRC-activated human breast cancer cell lines exhibited reduced p27, and
there was a correlation between SRC activation and reduced nuclear p27
in 482 primary human breast cancers. In tamoxifen-resistant breast
cancer cell lines, SRC inhibition increased p27 levels and restored
tamoxifen sensitivity. Chu et al. (2007) concluded that SRC-mediated
phosphorylation of p27 reduces its inhibitory action on cyclin E/CDK2,
facilitating subsequent p27 proteolysis.

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis of an adult human heart cDNA library, Hauck
et al. (2008) showed that p27 interacted with the C-terminal region of
casein kinase-2 (CK2)-alpha-prime (CSNK2A2; 115442). Immunocytochemical
analysis of primary rat ventricular cardiomyocytes revealed
colocalization of p27 with CK2-alpha-prime. Angiotensin II, a potent
inducer of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, induced proteasomal degradation of
p27 in primary rat cardiomyocytes through CK2-alpha-prime-dependent
phosphorylation of p27 on ser83 and thr187, which are conserved in
humans and rodents. Conversely, unphosphorylated p27 potently inhibited
CK2-alpha-prime. Hauck et al. (2008) concluded that downregulation of
p27 by CK2-alpha-prime is necessary for development of agonist- and
stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that bind to complementary
sequences in the 3-prime UTRs of target mRNAs and inhibit their
expression. Kedde et al. (2007) showed that the expression of DND1
(609385), an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein, counteracted
the inhibitory effect of several miRNAs in human cells and in primordial
germ cells of zebrafish by preventing the association of miRNAs with
their target mRNAs. Kedde et al. (2007) detailed the effect of DND1 on
the downregulation of p27 mRNA by miR221 (MIRN221; 300568) in human
cells. Introduction of DND1 abolished the interaction between miR221 and
the 3-prime UTR of p27 mRNA and countered the downregulation of p27
expression by miR221. DND1 bound a uridine-rich region in the 3-prime
UTR of p27 mRNA that is near the miR221-binding site and prevented
miR221 binding. At least 1 of the 2 uridine-rich regions in the p27
3-prime UTR and the RNA-binding domain of DND1 were required to rescue
p27 expression.

Cuesta et al. (2009) found that translation of p27 in HeLa cells and
HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells was cap dependent. Translation
via a proposed internal ribosome entry site appeared to be artifactual,
resulting from the presence of cryptic promoters in the 5-prime UTR.
Cuesta et al. (2009) showed that the dramatic increase in p27 following
phorbol ester treatment was not due to increased mRNA levels, but rather
to downregulation of MIR181A (see 612742) and relief of
MIR181A-dependent translational repression. The 3-prime UTR of p27 mRNA
contains 2 possible MIR181A-binding sites, 1 of which overlaps the
MIR221-binding site. Both MIR181A-binding sites could repress p27
translation either individually or synergistically.

Lin et al. (2010) showed that although Skp2 inactivation on its own does
not induce cellular senescence, aberrant protooncogenic signals as well
as inactivation of tumor suppressor genes do trigger a potent,
tumor-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of Skp2.
Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic stress-driven senescence
neither elicit activation of the p19(Arf) (see 600160)-p53 (191170)
pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depend on Aft4 (604064), p27, and
p21 (116899). Lin et al. (2010) further demonstrated that genetic Skp2
inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic conditions in
which the p19(Arf)-p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex
inhibitor can trigger cellular senescence in p53/Pten (601728)-deficient
cells and tumor regression in preclinical studies. Lin et al. (2010)
concluded that their findings provided proof-of-principle evidence that
pharmacologic inhibition of Skp2 may represent a general approach for
cancer prevention and therapy.

MAPPING

Baens et al. (1995) characterized 117 cDNAs isolated by direct cDNA
selection using pools of human chromosome 12p cosmids. Among these, 3
matched previously determined cDNA sequences, including the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor referred to as KIP1. STSs were
developed for all cosmids. Regional assignment of the STSs by PCR
analysis with somatic cell hybrids and fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) showed that the loci mapped to 12p13. Martin et al.
(1995) mapped this gene, which they referred to as CDKN4, to 12p12.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By PCR-based screening of genomic
YAC clones of the CEPH library, they isolated 7 containing the KIP1
gene. In 4 of these YACs, they found a common STS, D12S358, and 1 of the
4 YACs also contained an additional STS, D12S320, which had been located
4 cM apart from D12S358 on the Genethon genetic map. Most of the YACs
containing the KIP1 gene had been assigned to chromosome 12 from
hybridization data of inter-Alu PCR products from somatic hybrids.

By FISH, Saito et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Kip gene to chromosome
7D3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, Type IV

In a 48-year-old Caucasian female with primary hyperparathyroidism and a
history of pituitary adenoma, consistent with multiple endocrine
neoplasia type IV (MEN4; 610755), Pellegata et al. (2006) identified a
heterozygous nonsense mutation in the CDKN1B gene (600778.0001). The
mutation was also identified in her older sister who had renal
angiomyolipoma, her youngest sister, and that sister's teenage daughter,
who reported no symptoms but did not undergo thorough examination. No
mutations in the MEN1 gene (613733) were found in the proband or her
older sister.

- Other Disease Associations

Chang et al. (2004) analyzed the CDKN1B gene in 188 families with
hereditary prostate cancer (see 176807) and found a significant
association between the SNP -79C/T (dbSNP rs34330) and prostate cancer.
The -79C allele was overtransmitted from parents to affected offspring,
an association that was observed primarily in offspring whose age at
diagnosis was less than 65 years. Chang et al. (2004) suggested that
germline variants of this gene play a role in prostate cancer
susceptibility.

Grey et al. (2013) found biallelic loss of CDKN1B gene expression in a
boy with overgrowth and severe neurodevelopmental delay with autism. He
also had left-sided strabismus, maldescended testes, and challenging
behavior. Array CGH identified a heterozygous, approximately 108-kb
deletion on chromosome 12p13 encompassing the 5-prime end of CDKN1B,
APOLD1 (612456), and the 5-prime untranslated region of DDX47 (615428).
The patient's unaffected mother also carried this deletion. Both
individuals had decreased CDKN1B mRNA expression, but only the boy had
decreased protein levels. Sanger sequencing showed that the proband also
had a de novo heterozygous -73G-A transition in the promoter of the
CDKN1B gene that was demonstrated to result in significantly decreased
protein expression. Grey et al. (2013) postulated that the neurologic
phenotype in the proband fit a recessive model of inheritance and was
due to decreased expression of the CDKN1B below a threshold necessary to
ensure normal neurodevelopment. The findings were also consistent with a
mouse knockout model that has gigantism and hyperplasia of multiple
organs (Fero et al., 1996).

ANIMAL MODEL

Fero et al. (1996) found that targeted disruption of the murine
p27(Kip1) gene caused a gene dose-dependent increase in animal size
without other gross morphologic abnormalities. All tissues were enlarged
and contained more cells, although endocrine abnormalities were not
evident. Thymic hyperplasia was associated with increased T-lymphocyte
proliferation, and T cells showed enhanced IL2 (147680) responsiveness
in vitro. Thus, p27 deficiency may cause a cell-autonomous defect
resulting in enhanced proliferation in response to mitogens. In the
spleen, the absence of p27 selectively enhanced proliferation of
hematopoietic progenitor cells. That p27 and Rb function in the same
regulatory pathway was suggested by the finding that p27 deletion, like
deletion of the Rb gene, uniquely caused neoplastic growth of the
pituitary pars intermedia. The absence of p27 also caused an ovulatory
defect and female sterility. Maturation of second ovarian follicles into
corpora lutea, which express high levels of p27, was markedly impaired.

Zindy et al. (1999) generated mice with targeted deletions of both the
Ink4d (600927) and Kip1 genes. They found that terminally
differentiated, postmitotic neurons in these mice reentered the cell
cycle, divided, and underwent apoptosis. Zindy et al. (1999) noted that
when either Ink4d or Kip1 alone are deleted, the postmitotic state is
maintained, suggesting a redundant role for these genes in mature
neurons.

Mitsuhashi et al. (2001) described a mouse model in which p27(Kip1)
transgene expression was spatially restricted to the central nervous
system neuroepithelium and temporally controlled with doxycycline.
Transgene-specific transcripts were detectable within 6 hours of
doxycycline administration, and maximum nonlethal expression was
approached within 12 hours. After 18 to 26 hours of transgene
expression, the G1 phase of the cell cycle was estimated to increase
from 9 to 13 hours in the neocortical neuroepithelium, the maximum G1
phase length attainable in this proliferative population in normal mice.
Thus, the data established a direct link between p27(Kip1) and control
of G1 phase length in the mammalian central nervous system and unveiled
intrinsic mechanisms that constrain the G1 phase length to a putative
physiologic maximum despite ongoing p27(Kip1) transgene expression.

Phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) on threonine-187 by CDK2 is thought to
initiate the major pathway for p27 proteolysis. To test the importance
of this pathway critically in vivo, Malek et al. (2001) replaced the
murine p27 gene with one that encoded alanine instead of threonine at
position 187. Malek et al. (2001) demonstrated that cells expressing p27
with the T187A change were unable to downregulate p27 during the S and
G2 phases of the cell cycle, but that this had a surprisingly modest
effect on cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Malek et al.
(2001) demonstrated a second proteolytic pathway for controlling p27,
one that is activated by mitogens and degrades p27 exclusively during
G1.

Uchida et al. (2005) generated mice expressing human CDKN1B under the
control of the promoter of the rat insulin gene and observed that
increased expression of p27 in pancreatic beta cells induced severe
diabetes as a result of inhibition of beta-cell proliferation. In mice
lacking either insulin receptor substrate-2 (Irs2 -/-; see 600797) or
the long form of the leptin receptor (Lepr -/-; see 601007), they found
progressive accumulation of p27 in the nucleus of beta cells. Deletion
of Cdkn1b ameliorated hyperglycemia in these mouse models of type II
diabetes (125853) by increasing islet mass and maintaining compensatory
hyperinsulinemia, which the authors attributed predominantly to
stimulation of pancreatic beta-cell proliferation. Uchida et al. (2005)
concluded that p27 contributes to beta-cell failure in the development
of type II diabetes in Irs2 -/- and Lepr -/- (db/db) mice.

Wolfraim and Letterio (2005) found increased numbers of both Cd4
(186940)-positive and Cd8 (see 186910)-positive T cells in
p27(Kip1)-deficient mice. However, there was a greater increase in the
numbers of Cd8-positive T cells, resulting in a lower Cd4:Cd8 ratio, due
in part to enhanced proliferation of naive Cd8-positive T cells, but not
naive Cd4-positive T cells, under conditions of limiting Cd28
(186760)-mediated costimulation.

Nmyc (164840) promotes rapid cell division of granule neuron progenitors
(GNPs) in mice, and its conditional loss during embryonic cerebellar
development results in severe GNP deficiency, perturbs foliation, and
leads to reduced cerebellar mass. Since loss of Nmyc triggers precocious
expression of Kip1 and Ink4c (CDKN2C; 603369) in the cerebellar
primordium, Zindy et al. (2006) disrupted Kip1 and Ink4c in Nmyc-null
cerebella and found that this partially rescued GNP cell proliferation
and cerebellar foliation. They concluded that expression of NMYC and
concomitant downregulation of INK4C and KIP1 contribute to the proper
development of the cerebellum.

Sharov et al. (2006) showed that inhibition of BMP (see BMP1, 112264)
signaling in mouse keratinocytes altered the development of hair
follicles. Microarray and real-time PCR analysis of laser-captured hair
matrix cells showed a strong decrease in the expression of p27(Kip1) and
increased expression of selected cyclins in the transgenic mice.
p27(Kip1) knockout mice showed a similar increase in anagen hair
follicles associated with increased cell proliferation in hair bulbs.
Alternatively, activation of BMP signaling in human keratinocytes
induced growth arrest and stimulated p27(Kip1) expression. Sharov et al.
(2006) concluded that p27(Kip1) mediates the effects of BMP signaling on
hair follicle size.

Fritz et al. (2002) described a multiple endocrine neoplasia-like
autosomal recessive disorder in the rat. Animals exhibiting the mutant
phenotype developed multiple neuroendocrine malignancies within the
first year of life, including bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma,
multiple extraadrenal pheochromocytoma, bilateral medullary thyroid cell
neoplasia, bilateral parathyroid hyperplasia, and pituitary adenoma. The
appearance of neoplastic disease was preceded by the development of
bilateral juvenile cataracts. Although the spectrum of affected tissues
was reminiscent of human forms of MEN, no germline mutations were
detected in the RET (164761) or MEN1 (613733) genes. Segregation studies
in F1 and F2 crosses yielded frequencies of affected animals consistent
with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.

In rats with an MEN-like syndrome (Menx), with phenotypic overlap of
MEN1 (131100) and MEN2A (171400), Pellegata et al. (2006) performed
linkage analysis and identified a locus in a 4-Mb segment on rat
chromosome 4, which includes the Cdkn1b gene. Sequencing revealed a
homozygous frameshift mutation in the Cdkn1b gene resulting in a
dramatic reduction of p27(Kip1) protein.

Besson et al. (2007) generated knockin mice expressing a mutant p27
protein, called p27(CK-), that was unable to interact with cyclins and
cyclin-dependent kinases. In contrast to complete deletion of the Cdkn1b
gene, which causes spontaneous tumors only in pituitary, p27(CK-)
dominantly caused hyperplastic lesions and tumors in multiple organs.
The high incidence of spontaneous tumors in lung and retina was
associated with amplification of stem/progenitor cell populations.

Karlas et al. (2010) reported the discovery of 287 human host cell
genes, including CDKN1B, influencing influenza A virus replication in a
genomewide RNA interference screen. Using an independent assay, Karlas
et al. (2010) confirmed 168 hits (59%) inhibiting either the endemic
HIN1 (119 hits) or the pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A
virus strains, with an overlap of 60%. CDKN1B inhibited both viral
strains. Furthermore, H1N1 virus-infected p27-null mice accumulated
significantly lower viral titers in the lung, providing in vivo evidence
for the importance of this gene.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA, TYPE IV
CDKN1B, TRP76TER

In a 48-year-old Caucasian female with primary hyperparathyroidism and a
history of pituitary adenoma (MEN4; 610755), Pellegata et al. (2006)
identified a heterozygous 692G-A transition in the CDKN1B gene,
resulting in a trp76-to-ter (W76X) substitution. The mutation was also
identified in her older sister who had renal angiomyolipoma, her
youngest sister, and that sister's teenaged daughter, who reported no
symptoms but did not undergo thorough examination. The mutation was not
found in 380 unrelated healthy controls. Molecular and
immunohistochemical analysis of the renal angiomyolipoma showed that it
retained the CDKN1B wildtype allele and demonstrated RNA expression but
showed no p27 protein staining.

604249	TITLE *604249 RETICULON 3; RTN3
;;NEUROENDOCRINE-SPECIFIC PROTEIN-LIKE 2; NSPL2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The reticulons are a group of highly conserved genes with preferential
expression in neuroendocrine tissues (see, e.g., RTN1; 600865).

CLONING

During a subtraction cloning between macula and peripheral retina,
Moreira et al. (1999) isolated a novel member of the reticulon gene
family, which they designated reticulon-3. The mRNA for RTN3 was
approximately 3-fold more abundant in macula than in peripheral retina.
The 2,527-bp cDNA encodes a predicted 236-amino acid protein that shows
strong sequence similarity with other members of the RTN gene family
(see, e.g., 600865). Northern blot analysis showed that RTN3 is widely
expressed in human tissues, with highest expression in the brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moreira et al. (1999) determined that the RTN3 gene contains 7 exons and
spans more than 15 kb.

MAPPING

By use of somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid panels, Moreira et
al. (1999) mapped the RTN3 gene to 11q13, between markers D11S4535 and
D11S4627. Southern blot analysis identified the presence of at least one
pseudogene that was subsequently localized to chromosome 4.

GENE FUNCTION

He et al. (2004) found that BACE1 (604252) coimmunoprecipitated with
members of the reticulon family of proteins: RTN1, RTN2 (603183), RTN3,
and RTN4 (604475). BACE1 colocalized with RTN3 in neurons of human brain
gray matter, and with RTN4 in oligodendrocytes in white matter.
Overexpression of RTN3 in vitro inhibited BACE1 activity and decreased
amyloid precursor protein (APP; 104760) processing. The findings
suggested that reticulon proteins are negative modulators of BACE1
activity, and that RTN3 specifically blocks access of BACE1 to APP
within neurons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Windpassinger et al. (2003) excluded RTN3 as the gene mutant in Silver
spastic paraplegia syndrome (270685), the locus for which maps to
11q12-q14, as no mutations in RTN3 were found on sequence analysis of at
least 2 affected individuals from each of 4 different families and 1
healthy control.

607860	TITLE *607860 YY1 ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; YY1AP1
;;YY1-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; YAP;;
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2; HCCA2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By differential display PCR of normal hepatic tissue and hepatocellular
carcinomas, followed by screening a placenta cDNA library, Wang et al.
(2001) cloned YY1AP1, which they called HCCA2. The deduced 467-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 50.65 kD. HCCA2 contains
2 SH3-binding domains, 2 N-glycosylation sites, 6 N-myristoylation
sites, and numerous phosphorylation sites, but it does not have a
transmembrane domain, signal peptide, or targeting sequences. Northern
blot analysis detected 1.8- and 2.5-kb transcripts in all adult tissues
examined except liver. Expression was also detected in fetal liver,
lung, brain, and spleen. Western blot analysis of transfected embryonic
kidney fibroblasts detected HCCA2 at an apparent molecular mass of about
50 kD. Immunohistochemical staining showed that HCCA2 protein was
localized in the cytoplasm of liver cancer tissues, and it was not found
in surrounding nontumor hepatocytes.

Kuryshev et al. (2006) determined that YY1AP1 was formed by fusion of
the 5-prime region of the ASH1L gene (607999) and the 3-prime region of
the GON4L gene (610393) during a tandem segmental duplication on
chromosome 1. YY1AP1 contains the partial promoter and untranslated
first exon of ASH1L and coding exons 13 to 21 of GON4L. The 3-prime
region of YY1AP1 originated from a long terminal repeat of an endogenous
retrovirus, known as the MER51A repeat, that was inserted into exon 21
of GON4L after the duplication. The deduced YY1AP1 protein contains 750
amino acids, 748 of which correspond to amino acids 590 to 1,337 of the
GON4L protein. The last 2 C-terminal residues of YY1AP1 come from the
long terminal repeat of MER51A. RT-PCR detected ubiquitous expression of
YY1AP1, with highest levels in testis and skeletal muscle.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2001) determined that HCCA2 was not expressed in normal
adult liver tissue, but it was expressed in 79% of hepatocellular
carcinomas tested. HCCA2 expression was associated with invasion of the
tumor capsule.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Kuryshev et al. (2006) mapped the YY1AP1
gene to chromosome 1q22.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Paris and Williams (2000) identified several genes, including CDHR5,
which they called MUCDHL, by constructing a physical map of chromosome
11p15.5. They found that MUCDHL contains nonpolymorphic tandem repeats
similar to mucin proteins and a consensus calcium-binding motif found in
all cadherins.

MAPPING

Paris and Williams (2000) constructed a physical map of chromosome
11p15.5 and located the CDHR5 gene less than 250 kb telomeric to a mucin
gene cluster.

126063	TITLE *126063 DIHYDROLIPOAMIDE S-SUCCINYLTRANSFERASE; DLST
;;ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATE DEHYDROGENASE COMPLEX, E2 COMPONENT OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and branched chain
alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex) are a family of multienzyme
complexes. They are localized in mitochondria and catalyze the oxidative
decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids. These 3 alpha-keto acid
dehydrogenase complexes are composed of 3 different enzymes: alpha-keto
acid dehydrogenase (E1; 300502), dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2),
and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3; 238331). Dihydrolipoamide
succinyltransferase, which is a component of the structural core of the
alpha-keto glutarate dehydrogenase complex, was studied by Nakano et al.
(1993), who isolated a cDNA from a human fibroblast cDNA library. Amino
acid sequence analysis supported their previous observation (Nakano et
al., 1993) that human dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase lacks a
sequence motif for an E1 and/or E3 binding site. By Northern blot
analysis, Ali et al. (1994) detected ubiquitous expression of DLST in
peripheral tissues and brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nakano et al. (1993) found that the DLST gene contains 3 exons and 4
introns and that the nucleotide sequence at the 5-prime donor and
3-prime acceptor sites of all introns conformed to the gt-ag rule.

GENE FUNCTION

DLST is the E2 component of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex. In contrast to the E2 components of the other 2 alpha-keto acid
dehydrogenase complexes, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (see 300502)
and the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (see
608348), the alpha-KGDC E2 has a unique structure consisting of 2
domains and lacking a sequence motif of an E3 and/or E1 binding site
(Patel and Harris, 1995).

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nakano et al. (1993) found that
the DLST gene is located on 14q24.2-q24.3 and that a related sequence is
located on 1p31. The gene for the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase of
the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (DBT; 248610),
the site of the mutation in type 2 maple syrup urine disease (see
248600), is located on 1p31. Nakano et al. (1993) mentioned the
possibility that mutation of the DLST gene may be a cause of familial
Alzheimer disease that maps to 14q24.3 (AD3; 607822). Ali et al. (1994)
mapped the DLST gene (symbolized by them KGDHC) to 14q24.3 by isotopic
in situ hybridization. The cDNA they used also cross-hybridized to an
apparent E2k pseudogene on 1p31.

605328	TITLE *605328 KRUPPEL-LIKE FACTOR 13; KLF13
;;RANTES FACTOR OF LATE-ACTIVATED T LYMPHOCYTES 1; RFLAT1;;
FKLF2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

KLF13 belongs to a family of transcription factors that contain 3
classical zinc finger DNA-binding domains consisting of a zinc atom
tetrahedrally coordinated by 2 cysteines and 2 histidines (C2H2 motif).
These transcription factors bind to GC-rich sequences and related GT and
CACCC boxes (Scohy et al., 2000).

CLONING

Although many genes are induced early after T-cell activation, a few,
like RANTES (187011), are induced at the T-cell differentiation stage.
The A promoter region of the RANTES gene binds REL (e.g., RELA, 164014)
as well as non-REL proteins. Using Southwestern blotting of nuclear
extracts of activated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) probed with
oligonucleotides from the RANTES promoter A and B sites, Song et al.
(1999) identified proteins detected only at late activation stages. By
screening a day 5 activated PBL library with a 3-tandem A site probe,
Song et al. (1999) obtained a cDNA encoding the KLF13 protein, which
they termed RFLAT (RANTES factor of late-activated T lymphocytes). The
deduced 228-amino acid protein contains 3 contiguous TFIIIA (GTF3A;
600860)-like C-terminal DNA-binding zinc finger motifs, which are 65 to
73% homologous to SP1 (189906), SP3 (601804), and BTEB (602902). Its N
terminus, which is preceded by a stretch rich in basic amino acids, is
rich in proline, serine, and alanine residues. SDS-PAGE and Western blot
analysis indicated that KLF13 is expressed as a phosphorylated 38-kD
protein. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of 7.5-
and 5.0-kb transcripts, with greatest abundance in PBL and thymus.
Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis showed that KLF13 is
localized in the nucleus.

Using degenerate PCR primers based on the sequence for KLF1 (600599),
Asano et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA from fetal liver erythroid cells that
encodes KLF13, which they termed FKLF2 based on its structural
similarity to FKLF (TIEG2; 603301). By Northern blot analysis, they
showed that KLF13 was expressed as 4.4- and 1.5-kb transcripts in the
bone marrow and striated muscles but not in 12 other human tissues
analyzed.

By searching for sequences related to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain
of SP1, followed by screening a fetal mouse liver cDNA library, Scohy et
al. (2000) cloned mouse Klf13. Like the human protein, mouse Klf13
encodes a deduced 288-amino acid protein. Mouse and human KLF13 share
98% amino acid identity through the zinc finger domains and 87% identity
overall. Residues within each of the 3 zinc fingers that establish
specific contacts with DNA are completely conserved in KLF13, suggesting
that both mouse and human KLF13 recognize a classical GC box. Klf13 also
contains an N-terminal region rich in proline and alanine. RT-PCR
analysis revealed Klf13 expression in all mouse tissues examined, with
lowest levels in testis and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Gelshift binding analysis by Song et al. (1999) demonstrated that KLF13
binds to the A and A/B RANTES promoter binding sites, but not the B site
alone, and that NFKB (164011) also binds to these sites. Northern and
Western blot analysis demonstrated that while KLF13 mRNA is detectable
at constant steady state levels in resting and activated T cells, KLF13
protein appears only late after activation. Luciferase reporter assays
showed that KLF13 can transactivate the RANTES gene; whereas KLF13 is
the dominant transactivator of RANTES in T-cells, RELA is the dominant
transactivator in fibroblasts.

Luciferase reporter assays by Asano et al. (2000) showed that KLF13
activates predominantly the gamma- (HBG1; 142200) and, to a lesser
degree, the epsilon- (HBE1; 142100) and beta- (HBB; 141900) globin gene
promoters. They found that KLF13 is involved in activation of
transcription of a wide variety of genes in the cells of erythroid
lineage, including GATA1 (305371), glycophorin B (111740),
ferrochelatase (612386), porphobilinogen deaminase (HMBS; 609806), and
5-aminolevulinate synthase (125290).

MAPPING

Scott (2000) mapped the KLF13 gene to chromosome 15 based on sequence
similarity between the KLF13 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF150628) and a
chromosome 15 clone (GenBank GENBANK AC009873). By somatic cell hybrid
analysis, Scohy et al. (2000) mapped the KLF13 gene to chromosome 15.
Suske et al. (2005) stated that the human KLF13 gene maps to chromosome
15q13.2, and the mouse Klf13 gene to chromosome 7C.

604695	TITLE *604695 ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR-LIKE 3; ARL3
;;ARFL3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are low molecular weight GTP-binding
proteins belonging to the RAS superfamily; see ARF1 (103180). By
sequence analysis of clones randomly isolated from a fetal brain cDNA
library, Cavenagh et al. (1994) obtained an EST encoding ARL3. The
predicted 182-amino acid ARL3 protein shares 97% amino acid identity
with rat Arl3 and 43% identity with human ARF1. Like the ARFs, ARL3 has
a glycine at position 2, the site of N myristoylation, and lacks
cysteine residues near the C terminus, which are found in other members
of the RAS family. Northern blot analysis detected a 1-kb ARL3
transcript in all tissues tested, with highest expression in heart and
lung, and lower expression in brain, liver, kidney, ovary, and testis. A
5.5-kb transcript was also detected in most tissues, with highest
expression in brain. Immunoblot analysis detected ARL3 in human tumor
cell lines but not in normal rodent cells. Although ARL3 binds GTP, it
is devoid of activity in the cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation of
Gs (see 139320), and is therefore classified as an ARF-like protein.

By immunohistochemical analysis of several mammalian cell lines,
including human, Zhou et al. (2006) found that both ARL2 (601175) and
ARL3 were expressed at centrosomes, in cytoplasmic punctae, and in the
nucleus. ARL3 was also expressed at Golgi membranes and at the mitotic
spindle, particularly in metaphase and anaphase. Both ARL2 and ARL3
localized to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle, and their expression
in other structures was cell type specific.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Kim (1998) mapped
the ARL3 gene to chromosome 10q23.3.

GENE FUNCTION

Mutations in the retinitis pigmentosa-2 gene (RP2; 300757) cause a
severe form of X-linked retinal degeneration (see 312600). RP2 is a
plasma membrane-associated protein which shares homology with
tubulin-specific chaperone cofactor C (TBCC; 602971). The RP2 protein,
like cofactor C, stimulates the GTPase activity of tubulin in
combination with cofactor D. RP2 has also been shown to interact with
ARL3 in a nucleotide- and myristoylation-dependent manner. Grayson et
al. (2002) examined the relationship between RP2, cofactor C, and ARL3
in patient-derived cell lines and in the retina. In human retina, RP2
was localized to the plasma membrane in both rod and cone
photoreceptors, extending from the outer segment through the inner
segment to the synaptic terminals. In contrast, cofactor C and ARL3
localized predominantly to the photoreceptor-connecting cilium in rod
and cone photoreceptors. Cofactor C was cytoplasmic in distribution,
whereas ARL3 localized to other microtubule structures within all cells.
Grayson et al. (2002) suggested that RP2 may function in concert with
ARL3 to link the cell membrane with the cytoskeleton in photoreceptors
as part of the cell signaling or vesicular transport machinery.

Veltel et al. (2008) found that recombinant human RP2 formed a complex
with murine Arl3 and with human HRG4 (UNC119; 604011), the retinal
homolog of PDE-delta (PDE6D; 602676). RP2 induced hydrolysis of Arl3-GTP
in the Arl3-HRG4 complex, leading to the release of HRG4, which bound
only weakly to Arl3-GDP.

Zhou et al. (2006) stated that ARL2 and ARL3 arose from a common
ancestor early in eukaryotic evolution and that they remain highly
related. However, Zhou et al. (2006) found that the 2 GTPases had
distinct effects on microtubule function in mammalian cells. Knockdown
of ARL3 using RNA interference changed HeLa cell morphology, caused
Golgi fragmentation, and increased acetylation of alpha-tubulin (see
602529), which resulted in failure of cytokinesis, with increased number
of binucleated cells. Overexpression of ARL3 had little effect. In
contrast, knockdown of ARL2 in HeLa cells showed little effect, but
expression of ARL2 with a dominant activating mutation caused failure of
tubulin polymerization, with loss of microtubules and microtubule-based
mitotic spindle, resulting in cell cycle arrest in M phase.

Ismail et al. (2011) stated that PDE-delta binds to farnesylated small G
proteins. They presented the 1.7-angstrom structure of human PDE-delta
in complex with C-terminally farnesylated human RHEB (601293). PDE-delta
interacted almost exclusively with the C-terminal farnesyl moiety of
RHEB, which was inserted within the farnesyl-binding pocket of
PDE-delta. The interaction did not require guanine nucleotide, which
bound RHEB on a surface nearly opposite to the PDE-delta-binding site.
PDE-delta also interacted with mouse Arl2. The interaction of PDE-delta
with Arl2 was dependent upon GTP and caused a conformational change in
PDE-delta that closed its farnesyl-binding pocket. In solution, addition
of Arl2-GTP dissociated the PDE-delta-farnesylated RHEB complex.
Addition of Arl3-GTP also caused release of farnesylated RHEB from
PDE-delta. In transfected canine kidney cells, fluorescence-labeled RHEB
showed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localization. Addition of
PDE-delta relocalized RHEB into a cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution,
and subsequent addition of Arl2-GTP restored RHEB localization to ER and
Golgi membranes. Ismail et al. (2011) concluded that PDE-delta functions
as a solubilization factor for farnesylated RHEB and that ARL2 and ARL3
act in a GTP-dependent manner as allosteric release factors for
farnesylated RHEB.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Veltel et al. (2008) solved the crystal structure of the central G
domain of mouse Arl3 bound to a GTP analog and human RP2 to 2.6-angstrom
resolution. Both switch regions of Arl3 interacted with the N-terminal
beta-helix domain of RP2. Biochemical analysis showed that Arl3 had a
slow intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis, which was accelerated more than
1,400-fold by catalytic amounts of RP2. Veltel et al. (2008) also
determined that arg118 of RP2 and gln71 of Arl3 were crucial active site
catalytic residues. They concluded that RP2 is a GTPase-activating
protein (GAP) for ARL3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Schrick et al. (2006) found that while Arl3 +/- mice appeared normal,
Arl3 -/- mice were obtained at a submendelian ratio, were small and
sickly, and had markedly swollen abdomens. Arl3 -/- mice failed to
thrive and all died by 3 weeks of age. They exhibited abnormal
development of renal, hepatic, and pancreatic epithelial tubule
structures, with abnormal epithelial cell proliferation and cyst
formation characteristic of ARPKD (263200). Moreover, mice lacking Arl3
exhibited photoreceptor degeneration as early as postnatal day 14.
Schrick et al. (2006) concluded that absence of Arl3 causes a ciliary
disease affecting the kidney, biliary tract, pancreas, and retina.

611616	TITLE *611616 NAD KINASE; NADK
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NADK catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to NAD to
generate NADP, which in its reduced form acts as an electron donor for
biosynthetic reactions (Lerner et al., 2001).

CLONING

By EST database analysis using prokaryotic DNA kinase sequences as
probe, followed by PCR of a human fibroblast cDNA library, Lerner et al.
(2001) cloned NADK. The deduced 446-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of 49.2 kD. Northern blot analysis detected a 3.0-kb
transcript with high expression in placenta, moderate expression in
brain, colon, heart, liver, kidney, lung, spleen, stomach, and testis,
and low expression in small intestine. A band of 1.8 kb was detected in
several tissues.

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant NADK overexpressed in E. coli, Lerner et al. (2001)
showed that purified NADK catalyzed the synthesis of NADP from NAD and
ATP. By gel filtration analysis, they determined that catalytically
active human NADK was a homotetramer. NADK exhibited a specific activity
of 6.7 microM with a high specificity for NAD and ATP substrates. NADK
activity was resistant to heat treatment, had an optimum pH of 7-8, and
required divalent cations. NADK displayed a preference for zinc and
manganese ions over magnesium ions, while copper and nickel ions had no
effect on enzyme activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Lerner et al. (2001) determined that the NADK gene contains 11 exons
spanning 14 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Lerner et al. (2001) mapped the NADK gene
to chromosome 1p36.33-p36.21.

;;SCOTIN
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Zhang et al. (2000) cloned a cDNA encoding Scotin, which they called
HSPC217, from CD34 (142230)-positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. The deduced 170-amino acid protein contains an MYB (189990)
DNA-binding domain repeat signature. Microarray analysis of 5
hematopoietic cell lines detected low-level expression of Scotin in NB4
and Jurkat cells, but no expression was detected in HL60, K562, and U937
cells.

Bourdon et al. (2002) identified mouse Scotin by differential display of
spleen and thymus of normal and p53 (191170) null mice after gamma
irradiation of whole animals. The induced 1.85-kb transcript encodes a
deduced 235-amino acid protein. By searching an EST database using the
mouse sequence as probe, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Bourdon
et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Scotin from a placenta
cDNA library. The deduced 240-amino acid human protein shares 70%
identity with mouse Scotin. Both the human and the mouse proteins
contain an N-terminal signal sequence, a central transmembrane domain
composed of 18 hydrophobic amino acids, and a proline/tyrosine domain,
and both show an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD by Western blot
analysis. Immunolocalization of exogenously expressed Scotin revealed
colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers. By mutation
analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the proline-rich domain
is required for ER localization.

GENE FUNCTION

Bourdon et al. (2002) noted that mouse thymus and spleen cells underwent
massive p53-dependent apoptosis following ultraviolet irradiation or
exposure to actinomycin D. They found that Scotin mRNA was induced
coincident with apoptosis and was expressed only in spleen and thymus of
irradiated wildtype mice and not in the spleen or thymus of irradiated
p53 null mice. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, they
confirmed direct binding between p53 and Scotin, and using a luciferase
reporter plasmid driven by the mouse Scotin promoter, they confirmed
dose-dependent p53 transactiviation. Furthermore, Bourdon et al. (2002)
showed that the apoptosis induced by the p53/Scotin pathway is caspase
dependent.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et al. (2002) determined that the
human Scotin gene contains 6 exons. They identified a p53-responsive
element of 9 decamers within the mouse Scotin promoter.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2000) mapped the human
Scotin gene to chromosome 3. By genomic sequence analysis, Bourdon et
al. (2002) mapped the Scotin gene to chromosome 3p21.3. They also
identified a Scotin pseudogene on chromosome Xq13.1-q13.3.

172471	TITLE *172471 PHOSPHORYLASE KINASE, TESTIS/LIVER, GAMMA-2; PHKG2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The PHKG2 gene encodes the hepatic and testis isoform of the gamma
subunit of phosphorylase kinase (PHK; EC 2.7.11.19). The skeletal muscle
isoform of the gamma subunit is encoded by the PHKG1 gene (172470).

CLONING

Whitmore et al. (1994) isolated a clone identified as the PHKG2 gene
from a heteronuclear cDNA library constructed from a mouse/human somatic
cell hybrid that contained chromosome 16. Most of the sequence showed
100% homology with the sequence of an isoform of a catalytic subunit of
phosphorylase kinase (Hanks, 1989).

GENE STRUCTURE

Burwinkel et al. (1998) determined that the PHKG2 gene contains 10 exons
and spans 9.5 kb. The positions of introns were highly conserved between
PHKG2 and PHKG1. The beginning of intron 2 harbors a highly polymorphic
GGT/GT microsatellite repeat.

MAPPING

Whitmore et al. (1994) mapped the PHKG2 gene to chromosome 16p12.1-p11.2
by use of a high-resolution somatic cell panel.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Maichele et al. (1996) reported that autosomal liver-specific PHK
deficiency (glycogen storage disease IXc; GSD9C; 613027) was caused by
mutations in the PHKG2 gene. They found homozygous PHKG2 mutations in 3
patients of consanguineous parentage. One mutation was a single basepair
insertion in codon 89 that caused a frameshift and premature chain
termination (172471.0001). The 3 other mutations resulted in
nonconservative replacements of amino acid residues that are highly
conserved within the catalytic core regions of all protein kinases. The
findings suggested that the PHKG2 gene product is the predominant
isoform of catalytic gamma subunit of PHK not only in testis but also in
liver, erythrocytes, and possibly other nonmuscle tissues.

Burwinkel et al. (1998) identified homozygous translation-terminating
mutations in the PHKG2 gene, R442X (17241.0004) and 277delC
(172471.0005), in 2 patients with liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency
who developed cirrhosis in childhood. As liver phosphorylase kinase
deficiency is generally a benign condition and progression to cirrhosis
is very rare, the findings suggested to the authors that PHKG2 mutations
are particularly associated with an increased cirrhosis risk.

Burwinkel et al. (2000) reported compound heterozygosity for missense
mutations in the PHKG2 gene (172471.0006; 172471.0007) in a child with
phosphorylase kinase deficiency and cirrhosis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Malthus et al. (1980) described deficiency of liver phosphorylase kinase
in rats and concluded that it was an autosomal recessive trait. Apart
from hepatomegaly, the affected rats appear healthy. Clark and Haynes
(1988) described autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease in the rat
(gsd/gsd). Maichele et al. (1996) identified a homozygous mutation in
the rat Phkg2 gene (D215N) as responsible for the gsd phenotype in the
rat.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, 1-BP INS

In a Norwegian girl with autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease
IXc (613027) Sovik et al. (1982), Maichele et al. (1996) identified
homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion in codon 89 of the PHKG2 gene; the
resultant frameshift (after 22% of the normal length of the reading
frame) led to premature termination of the predicted polypeptide after
12 additional amino acids. The parents, who were fourth cousins, and a
sister were unaffected. She proband presented at 5 months of age, and
again at 3 years, with marked hepatomegaly, generalized muscular
hypotonia, growth retardation, elevated serum transaminases, and massive
liver glycogenosis. PHK activity was barely detectable in liver; in a
muscle biopsy, PHK activity was moderately reduced (35% of controls) but
muscle glycogen content was nevertheless low. No liver fibrosis was
observed. She attained a normal height of 172 cm at age 18, and menarche
was at age 17. The relative size of the liver gradually decreased, and
at age 18 serum activities of gamma-glutamyltransferase and alanine
aminotransferase were approaching normal ranges. Serum cholesterol was
normal, hypoglycemic symptoms were not noted, and body weight was
normal.

.0002
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, GLY189GLU

In a French girl with glycogen storage disease IXc (613027), whose
parents were first cousins, Maichele et al. (1996) identified
homozygosity for a G-to-A transition in the PHKG2 gene that led to a
gly189-to-glu (G189E) substitution. G189 is absolutely conserved between
the testicular and muscle forms of the gamma subunit of several species
and is never occupied by charged amino acids. The patient had been
hospitalized at 7 months of age because of hypoglycemic episodes and
pronounced hepatomegaly. Mild muscle hypotonia and retardation of growth
and motor development were also observed. Notable laboratory findings
were persistent hypoglycemia with acidosis, and elevated triglycerides
and transaminases. Liver histology revealed fine portal fibrosis.

.0003
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, VAL106GLU

In a Pakistani girl with glycogen storage disease IXc (613027), whose
parents were first cousins, Maichele et al. (1996) demonstrated
homozygosity for a val106-to-glu (V106E) missense mutation in the PHKG2
gene. The girl was admitted at the age of 15 months for investigation of
a distended abdomen due to hepatomegaly with no other clinical symptoms
except growth retardation. However, she had increased serum ALT and
triglycerides, increased liver glycogen, and severe fibrosis and
proliferation of bile ducts on liver biopsy.

.0004
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, ARG44TER

In a female with liver phosphorylase kinase deficiency and cirrhosis
(GSD9C; 612027), whose parents were consanguineous, Burwinkel et al.
(1998) found point mutations in the PHKG2 gene. One patient had a C-to-T
transition in exon 3, resulting in an arg44-to-ter (R44X) nonsense
mutation. In an earlier biochemical analysis of her family (Kagalwalla
et al., 1995), her father and 2 sibs had PHK activities in the
heterozygous range, whereas her mother had normal PHK activity in
repeated tests, so that a new maternal mutation was suspected in spite
of her parents' consanguinity. However, analysis of the parents' DNA
indicated that both were heterozygous for the nonsense mutation.

.0005
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, 1-BP DEL, 277C

In a female with deficiency of liver phosphorylase kinase and cirrhosis
(GSD9C; 613027) who had previously been described by Shiomi et al.
(1989), Burwinkel et al. (1998) identified deletion of a cytosine
residue in codon 93 (exon 4) of the PHKG2 gene, leading to a frameshift
after 23% of the coding sequence and termination of translation after 17
additional codons. The patient's parents were consanguineous.

.0006
GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE IXc
PHKG2, HIS144TYR

In a male child of unrelated English parents with liver phosphorylase
kinase deficiency and cirrhosis (GSD9C; 613027), Burwinkel et al. (2000)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the PHKG2 gene: a
C-to-T transition resulting in a his144-to-tyr (H144Y) substitution,
which was inherited from his father, and a T-to-G transversion resulting
in a leu225-to-arg (L225R) substitution (172471.0007), which was
inherited from his mother.
