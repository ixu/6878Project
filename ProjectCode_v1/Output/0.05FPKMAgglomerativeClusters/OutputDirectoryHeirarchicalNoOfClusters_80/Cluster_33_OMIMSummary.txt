DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the lipocalin family, such as LCN10, have a common structure
consisting of an 8-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel that forms a
cup-shaped ligand-binding pocket or calyx. Lipocalins generally bind
small hydrophobic ligands and transport them to specific cells (Suzuki
et al., 2004).

CLONING

Suzuki et al. (2004) cloned mouse Lcn10, which encodes a deduced
182-amino acid protein. They identified human LCN10 by database
analysis. Northern blot analysis detected Lcn10 expression in mouse
epididymis only, and epididymal expression began at 3 weeks of age. In
situ hybridization detected Lcn10 in the epithelium lining the initial
segment and segment 2 of mouse epididymis.

GENE FUNCTION

Suzuki et al. (2004) found that expression of Lcn10 in mouse epididymis
disappeared after castration and was only partially restored by
testosterone administration.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Suzuki et al. (2004) mapped the LCN10 gene
to an LCN gene cluster on chromosome 9q34. They mapped the mouse Lcn10
gene to a syntenic region of mouse chromosome 2A3.

;;T-BOX EXPRESSED IN T CELLS; TBET
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Naive T helper (Th) cells differentiate into 2 subsets, Th1 and Th2,
each with distinct functions and cytokine profiles. TBX21 is a
Th1-specific T-box transcription factor that controls the expression of
the hallmark Th1 cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) (Szabo et
al., 2000).

CLONING

Using a yeast 1-hybrid approach, Szabo et al. (2000) isolated clones
encoding murine Tbx21, which they called 'T-box expressed in T cells,'
or Tbet. The murine Tbx21 gene encodes a deduced 530-amino acid protein
containing a 189-amino acid T-box DNA-binding domain that shows homology
to murine Tbr1 (604616) and Xenopus eomesodermin (EOMES; 604615). The
authors subsequently cloned human TBX21, which encodes a 535-amino acid
protein that shares 88% amino acid identity with murine Tbx21. Northern
blot analysis detected TBX21 expression in lung, thymus, and spleen.

Zhang and Yang (2000) also cloned and characterized TBX21. Northern blot
analysis revealed expression of a 2.7-kb transcript in peripheral blood
leukocytes, spleen, and lung, as well as in NK cell lines. No expression
was detected in mouse embryonic tissue.

GENE FUNCTION

Szabo et al. (2000) showed that TBX21 expression correlates with IFNG
expression in Th1 and natural killer (NK) cells. Ectopic expression of
TBX21 both transactivated the IFNG gene and induced endogenous IFNG
production. Retroviral gene transduction of TBX21 into polarized Th2 and
Tc2 primary T cells redirected them into Th1 and Tc1 cells,
respectively, as evidenced by the simultaneous induction of IFNG and
repression of interleukin-4 (IL4; 147780) and interleukin-5 (IL5;
147850). Szabo et al. (2000) concluded that TBX21 initiates Th1 lineage
development from naive Th precursor cells both by activating Th1 genetic
programs and by repressing the opposing Th2 programs.

Differentiation of T helper cells into mature Th2 cells is associated
with chromatin remodeling of the IL4 and IL13 (147683) genes, whereas
differentiation into Th1 cells evokes chromatin remodeling of the IFNG
gene (Agarwal and Rao, 1998). Also, polarized Th2 cells do not express
IL12RB2 (601642) and therefore do not signal in response to IL12
(161560). However, Smits et al. (2001) found that anti-CD3/anti-CD28
stimulation of Th2 cells from either normal individuals or atopic
patients in the presence of IL12 restored IL12RB2 expression and
signaling. The change to a stable Th0/Th1 phenotype was accompanied by a
loss of GATA3 (131320) expression, a hallmark of the Th2 phenotype, and
the induction of TBX21 expression. Smits et al. (2001) proposed that the
human Th2 phenotype is less stable than that observed in the mouse and
that an IL12-promoting therapeutic approach might be beneficial for
Th2-mediated immune disorders.

Using real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR, Grogan et al. (2001) showed that
Tbet expression is optimal after stimulation with IL12 in wildtype but
not Stat4 (600558)-deficient mice.

Using RT-PCR, Mullen et al. (2001) showed that Tbet expression is
suppressed in the presence of IL4 and anti-IL12, but that Tbet is
expressed in the absence of IL12 and in the presence of anti-IL4.
Ectopic expression of Tbet restored Ifng expression in Stat4-deficient
cells, targeted the remodeling of the Ifng locus, and induced expression
of Il12rb2. Flow cytometric analysis showed that IL12 enhances and
prolongs Ifng expression in Tbet-differentiated Th1 cells through an
interaction with CREB-binding protein (see CREBBP; 600140). Mullen et
al. (2001) suggested that TBET is upstream of the STAT4 pathway. They
also proposed that cytokines may not induce differentiation of T helper
cells but may instead act as essential secondary stimuli that mediate
selective survival of a lineage.

Finotto et al. (2002) observed reduced expression of the T(H)1
transcription factor Tbet in T cells from airways of patients with
asthma compared with that in T cells from airways of nonasthmatic
patients, suggesting that loss of Tbet might be associated with asthma.

Tbet is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors that
appears to regulate lineage commitment in CD4 T helper cells in part by
activating the hallmark T(H)1 cytokine, IFN-gamma (147570). IFN-gamma is
also produced by NK cells and most prominently by CD8 cytotoxic T cells,
and is vital for the control of microbial pathogens. Although Tbet is
expressed in all these cell types, Szabo et al. (2002) demonstrated that
it is required for control of IFN-gamma production in CD4 and NK cells,
but not in CD8 cells. This difference is also apparent in the function
of these cell subsets. Thus, Szabo et al. (2002) concluded that the
regulation of a single cytokine, IFN-gamma, is controlled by distinct
transcriptional mechanisms within the T cell lineage. Szabo et al.
(2002) studied mice deficient in Tbet and established that Tbet is a
transcription factor required for T(H)1 lineage commitment.

Liu et al. (2003) noted that CpG dinucleotides have prophylactic and
therapeutic effects in allergies that have been associated with the
selective downregulation of IgE (147180 )and Th2 cytokine production in
mouse models and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from atopic
patients. CpG acts through TLR9 (605474), which is not expressed by T
cells. Liu et al. (2003) found that treatment of mouse splenocytes or
human B lymphocytes with CpG (ODN 2006) upregulated expression of TBET
in these cells by a mechanism dependent on TLR9 and independent of IFNG
and STAT1 (600555). CpG did not upregulate TBET in T cells. Using
specific inhibitors, the authors showed that TBET mRNA expression
required NFKB (see 164011), p38 (MAPK14; 600289), and IL12. Functional
analysis indicated that CpG completely inhibited IgE secretion induced
by IL4 and CD40 (109535) ligation and that IgG1 (147100) was severely
reduced. Liu et al. (2003) proposed that the K type of CpG (e.g., ODN
2006), which has a phosphorothioate backbone, may be a preferable
therapeutic CpG drug compared with the D type, which preferentially
stimulates IFNG and produces low levels of TNFA (191160), results
associated with inflammatory side effects.

Fields et al. (2002) noted that high levels of histone acetylation at
particular loci correlate with transcriptional activity, whereas reduced
levels correlate with silencing. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP), PCR, and green fluorescent protein analysis, they demonstrated
that histones in the cytokine loci (IFNG and IL4) of naive T cells are
unacetylated, but upon TCR stimulation, the loci are rapidly and
progressively acetylated on histones H3 and H4. The acetylation at the
IL4 locus occurs early, regardless of Th1/Th2 polarizing conditions,
correlating with early transcription. The maintenance of acetylation
depends on cytokine and STAT4 and STAT6 (601512) signaling and also on
the transactivator activity of TBET and GATA3, the putative 'master
regulators' of Th lineage determination.

Hwang et al. (2005) reported that TBET represses Th2 lineage commitment
through tyrosine kinase-mediated interaction between itself and GATA3
that interferes with the binding of GATA3 to its target DNA. Hwang et
al. (2005) concluded that their results provide a novel function for
tyrosine phosphorylation of a transcription factor in specifying
alternate fates of a common progenitor cell. Hwang et al. (2005) showed
that TBET phosphorylation is restricted to the TEC kinases ITK (186973)
and RLK (600058). Coexpression studies demonstrated that this was most
efficiently performed by ITK. In primary CD4 T cells isolated from ITK-,
RLK-, or double ITK/RLK-deficient mice, the greatest diminution of TBET
tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in the absence of ITK. Furthermore,
mutation of TBET at tyrosine residue 525, but not control tyrosine
residue 437, resulted in greatly reduced phosphorylation by ITK,
revealing that ITK phosphorylates TBET at residue Y525 after T cell
receptor stimulation.

Hohler et al. (2005) examined monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins
for cytokine production and transcription factors controlling Th1/Th2
differentiation and observed low intrapair variability in MZ compared
with DZ twins in expression of IFNG, TNF, and TBET. In contrast, MZ and
DZ twins were equally similar in terms of IL4 production and GATA3
expression. Hohler et al. (2005) proposed that Th1, but not Th2,
responses are genetically determined and that Th2-associated diseases in
humans may be due to genetic variations in Th1 cytokine regulation via
TBET.

Chen et al. (2006) noted that activated T cells, particularly Th1 cells,
express sialyl Lewis x, but resting T cells do not. Using reporter
analysis, they showed that TBET promoted and GATA3 repressed
transcription of FUT7 (602030), the rate-limiting enzyme for sialyl
Lewis x synthesis. TBET interfered with GATA3 binding to its target DNA,
but GATA3 also interfered with TBET binding to the FUT7 promoter. GATA3
regulated FUT7 transcription by recruiting, in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner, histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3; 605166)
and HDAC5 (605315) and by competing with CBP/p300 (EP300; 602700) in
binding to the N terminus of TBET. Maximal expression of FUT7 and sialyl
Lewis x in T cells was obtained by ROG (ZBTB32; 605859)-mediated
suppression of GATA3. Chen et al. (2006) concluded that the GATA3/TBET
transcription factor complex regulates cell lineage-specific expression
of lymphocyte homing receptors and that glycoconjugates are regulated by
this complex to attain cell lineage-specific expression in Th1 and Th2
lymphocyte subsets.

Intlekofer et al. (2008) demonstrated that CD8+ T cells deficient in the
transcription factors Tbet and eomesodermin (Eomes) (604615) fail to
differentiate into functional killers required for defense against
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Instead, virus-specific CD8+ T cells
lacking both Tbet and Eomes differentiated into an interleukin-17 (IL17;
603149)-secreting lineage, reminiscent of the helper T cell fate that
has been implicated in autoimmunity and extracellular microbial defense.
Upon viral infection, mice with T cells lacking both Tbet and Eomes
develop a CD8+ T cell-dependent, progressive inflammatory and wasting
syndrome characterized by multiorgan infiltration of neutrophils.
Intlekofer et al. (2008) concluded that Tbet and Eomes ensure that CD8+
T cells adopt an appropriate course of intracellular rather than
extracellular destruction.

CD4+ T helper cells that selectively produce interleukin-17 (Th17) are
critical for host defense and immunity. Ghoreschi et al. (2010) showed
that Th17 differentiation can occur in the absence of TGF-beta (190180)
signaling. Neither IL6 (147620) nor IL23 (see 605580) alone efficiently
generated Th17 cells; however, these cytokines in combination with
IL1-beta (147720) effectively induced IL17 production in naive
precursors, independently of TGF-beta. Epigenetic modification of the
IL17A (603149), IL17F (606496), and RORC (602943) promoters proceeded
without TGF-beta-1, allowing the generation of cells that coexpressed
ROR-gamma-t (encoded by RORC) and Tbet. Tbet+ROR-gamma-t+Th17 cells are
generated in vivo during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and
adoptively transferred Th17 cells generated with IL23 without TGF-beta-1
were pathogenic in this disease model. Ghoreschi et al. (2010) concluded
that their data indicated an alternative mode for Th17 differentiation,
and that, consistent with genetic data linking IL23R (607562) with
autoimmunity, their findings reemphasized the importance of IL23 and
therefore may have therapeutic implications.

Paley et al. (2012) found that 2 distinct states of virus-specific CD8+
T cells exist in chronically infected mice and humans. Differential
expression of the T-box transcription factors Tbet and Eomesodermin
(Eomes) facilitated the cooperative maintenance of the pool of antiviral
CD8+ T cells during chronic viral infection. Tbet(hi) cells displayed
low intrinsic turnover but proliferated in response to persisting
antigen, giving rise to Eomes(hi) terminal progeny. Genetic elimination
of either subset resulted in failure to control chronic infection, which
suggested that an imbalance in differentiation and renewal could
underlie the collapse of immunity in humans with chronic infections.

Klose et al. (2013) provided evidence that the transcription factor Tbet
determines the fate of a distinct lineage of CCR6 (601835)-negative
ROR-gamma-t (602943)-positive innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Postnatally
emerging CCR6-ROR-gamma-t+ ILCs upregulated Tbet, and this was
controlled by cues from the commensal microbiota and IL23 (605580). In
contrast, CCR6+ROR-gamma-t+ ILCs, which arise earlier during ontogeny,
did not express Tbet. Tbet instructed the expression of Tbet target
genes such as interferon-gamma (147570) and of the natural cytotoxicity
receptor NKp46 (604530). Mice genetically lacking Tbet showed normal
development of CCR6-ROR-gamma-t innate lymphoid cells, but these cells
could not differentiate into NKp46-expressing ROR-gamma-t+ ILCs (i.e.,
IL22 (605330)-producing natural killer cells) and failed to produce
interferon-gamma. The production of interferon-gamma by Tbet-expressing
CCR6-ROR-gamma-t+ ILCs was essential for the release of mucus-forming
glycoproteins required to protect the epithelial barrier against
Salmonella enterica infection. Klose et al. (2013) concluded that
coexpression of Tbet and ROR-gamma-t, which is also found in subsets of
IL17-producing T-helper cells, may be an evolutionarily conserved
transcriptional program that originally developed as part of the innate
defense against infections but that also confers an increased risk of
immune-mediated pathology.

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhang and Yang (2000) determined by genomic sequence analysis that the
mouse and human TBX21 genes contain 6 exons.

MAPPING

Zhang and Yang (2000) mapped the mouse Tbx21 gene to chromosome 11D in
an area showing homology of synteny with human chromosome 17.

ANIMAL MODEL

Finotto et al. (2002) generated mice lacking the Tbet gene by targeted
disruption. Heterozygous or homozygous knockout mice exhibited airway
hyperresponsiveness in response to methacholine. Tbet homozygous
knockout mice showed peribronchial and perivenular infiltration with
eosinophils and lymphocytes compared with wildtype littermates. Tbet
heterozygotes, which display only 50% reduction of Tbet protein
expression, displayed a phenotype very similar to that of mice with a
complete absence of Tbet. Tbet heterozygotes and homozygote knockout
mice also demonstrated thickening of the airway subbasement membrane
collagen layer as well as increased expression of some cytokines.
However, the asthma-like phenotype in these mice was independent of
allergen exposure and was not altered by allergen exposure. Finotto et
al. (2002) concluded that mice with a targeted deletion of the Tbet gene
and severe combined immunodeficient mice receiving CD4(+) cells from
Tbet knockout mice spontaneously demonstrated multiple physiologic and
inflammatory features characteristic of asthma.

By replacing the C terminus of Tbet, which contains the trans-activation
domain, with the repression domain of the Drosophila 'engrailed' protein
(see 131290), Mullen et al. (2002) generated a dominant-negative (DN)
Tbet cDNA. Introduction of DN Tbet into cells developing under
Th1-inducing conditions, but not into mature Th1 cells, substantially
inhibited their capacity to express Ifng and resulted in defective
persistence of hypersensitivity site I chromatin within Ifng. Levels of
Il12rb2, however, were reduced in both developing and mature Th1 cells
by DN Tbet. Screening for homeobox factors expressed in Th1 cells by
oligonucleotide array and RT-PCR analysis determined that only Hlx
(142995) is expressed at higher levels in Th1 lymphocytes than in Th2
lymphocytes. Hlx appeared at a slower rate than Tbet and could be
induced by Tbet. Ectopic expression in Stat4 -/- Th2-like cells of both
Tbet and Hlx allowed maximal and synergistic expression of Ifng in these
cells. Introduction of DN Tbet into mature Th1 cells inhibited the
expression of Hlx.

Svensson et al. (2005) noted that both Il15 (600554) -/- mice, which
lack NK and NKT cells, and Ifng -/- mice are highly susceptible to
genital herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 infection. CD4-positive T cells and
IFNG are the most important components of acquired immunity to genital
HSV-2 infection, and impaired HSV-2-specific IFNG responses in humans
correlate with recurrent clinical disease. Svensson et al. (2005)
vaginally infected Tbet -/- mice with HSV-2. Tbet -/- mice had increased
vaginal and spinal cord viral titers, more severe disease, shorter time
to death, reduced NK-cell activity, impaired Ifng production, lower
specific antibody production, and fewer splenic B cells compared with
wildtype mice. These differences were even more marked in mice first
vaccinated with an attenuated HSV-2 strain and then challenged with
virulent HSV-2. However, CD8-positive T cell-mediated cytotoxicity was
actually stronger in Tbet -/- mice compared with wildtype mice. Svensson
et al. (2005) concluded that TBET is important in both innate defense
and for generation of protective Th1 immunity against genital HSV-2
infection, primarily through its control of NK and CD4-positive T-cell
function.

Ravindran et al. (2005) noted that Tbet-deficient mice resolve infection
with the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes despite having
only small numbers of Cd4-positive Ifng-producing T cells. In contrast,
they found that challenge of Tbet -/- mice with an attenuated Salmonella
strain resulted in death of most mice in less than a month. Tbet -/-
mice failed to produce Ifng and to switch immunoglobulin isotypes.
Spleen cells of infected Tbet -/- mice did not produce Ifng, but they
did secrete increased levels of Il10 (124092), but not Il4. Ravindran et
al. (2005) concluded that CD4-positive T cells expressing TBET are
required for development of Salmonella-specific Th1 cells, regulation of
IL10 production, and resistance to Salmonella infection.

Using immunohistochemical analysis, Wang et al. (2006) found expression
of TBET in inflammatory infiltrates of human synovial tissue from
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 180300). Tbet -/- mice with the
collagen antibody-induced arthritis model of RA had markedly reduced
joint inflammation at both early and late time points. Mice lacking both
Rag2 (179616) and Tbet were resistant to disease. However, adoptive
transfer of dendritic cells expressing Tbet reconstituted inflammation
in both Tbet -/- and Tbet -/- Rag2 -/- mice. Wang et al. (2006)
concluded that TBET has a vital role in DCs that links innate and
adaptive immunity to regulate inflammatory responses.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ASTHMA, ASPIRIN-INDUCED, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
ASTHMA AND NASAL POLYPS, INCLUDED
TBX21, -1993T-C

Akahoshi et al. (2005) identified a -1993T-C SNP in the promoter region
of the TBX21 gene and found that the substitution increases the affinity
of an unknown nuclear protein for the binding site in that region,
resulting in increased transcriptional activity of the TBX21 gene. There
was a significant association between the promoter SNP and
aspirin-induced asthma (see 208550) in a Japanese cohort (p = 0.004),
with increased risk associated with a C allele (OR = 1.93; 95% CI,
1.22-3.06). The association was confirmed in additional independent
samples from patients with asthma and nasal polyposis (see 208550)
regardless of aspirin hypersensitivity (p = 0.008).

603960	TITLE *603960 CALICIN; CCIN
DESCRIPTION In mammalian sperm, the dense cytoplasmic webs surrounding the nuclei
contain a complex structure called the perinuclear theca. In bovine
sperm heads, the perinuclear theca is subdivided into the anterior
subacrosomal layer and the posterior calyx, a funnel-shaped, dense, and
stable structure tightly surrounding the posterior part of the nucleus
on its inner side and apposed to the plasma membrane on the outer side.
Longo et al. (1987) determined that 2 kinds of basic proteins are the
major constituents of the thecal structure: calicin, a 60-kD protein
localized almost exclusively to the calyx, and a group of multiple-band
polypeptides (MBPs or cylicins; see 300768) that are found both in the
calyx and the subacrosomal layer. They speculated that during
spermiogenesis, these insoluble basic proteins contribute to the
formation of the perinuclear theca as an architectural element involved
in the shape changes and the intimate association of the nucleus with
the acrosome and the plasma membrane.

Von Bulow et al. (1995) purified calicin from bull sperm and determined
a partial protein sequence. By PCR analysis of testis cDNA with
oligonucleotide primers based on the calicin protein sequence, they
isolated bovine and human cDNAs encoding calicin. The predicted bovine
protein contains 588 amino acids and has a calculated pI of 8.1. The
partial human cDNA encodes a protein that starts at a position
corresponding to the fourth amino acid of bovine calicin. Overall, the 2
calicins are 91% identical. There are 3 consecutive repeats in the
middle of the calicin protein. Sequence comparisons revealed that
calicin shares homology with the Drosophila kelch protein, which is
associated with the actin-rich intercellular bridges (ring canals) in
the egg chamber that connect the oocyte and the nurse cells. Von Bulow
et al. (1995) noted that calicin is missing or is arranged in a
dramatically different pattern in the heads of malformed human
spermatozoa such as teratozoospermias with 'round-headed' sperm or with
other 'postacrosomal sheath defects.'

604386	TITLE *604386 ZINC FINGER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR TRPS1; TRPS1
;;TRPS1 GENE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

TRPS1 is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor involved in the
regulation of chondrocyte and perichondrium development (Napierala et
al., 2008).

CLONING

Momeni et al. (2000) positionally cloned a gene that spanned the
chromosomal breakpoint in 2 patients with trichorhinophalangeal syndrome
type I (TRPS I; 190350) and was deleted in 5 patients with TRPS I
associated with an interstitial deletion. Northern blot analyses
revealed transcripts of 7 and 10.5 kb. The gene, designated TRPS1,
encodes a polypeptide of 1,281 amino acids. The predicted protein
sequence has 2 potential nuclear localization signals (LRRRRG and
RRRTRKR) and an unusual combination of different zinc finger motifs,
including IKAROS-like (see 603023) and GATA-binding (see 600576)
sequences. Kaiser et al. (2004) presented evidence that only one of the
basic amino acid sequences, the RRRTRKR motif (amino acids 946-952),
acts as a nuclear localization signal.

GENE STRUCTURE

Momeni et al. (2000) determined that the TRPS1 gene contains 7 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Momeni et al. (2000) mapped the TRPS1 gene
to chromosome 8q24.

GENE FUNCTION

Kaiser et al. (2003) found that 2 distinct regions of the nuclear
transcription factor TRPS1 can physically interact with the dynein light
chain protein DNCL1 (601562). Region A covers 89 amino acids (635-723),
spanning 3 potential C2H2 zinc finger structures, and region B covers
the 100 most C-terminal amino acids (1182-1281) containing the
IKAROS-like motif. DNCL1 colocalized with TRPS1 in dot-like structures
in the cell nucleus. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that
the interaction of DNCL1 and TRPS1 lowered the binding of TRPS1 to the
GATA consensus sequence. In addition, a GATA-regulated reporter gene
assay indicated that DNCL1 could suppress the transcriptional repression
activity of TRPS1.

Radvanyi et al. (2005) performed a comprehensive differential gene
expression screen on a panel of 54 breast tumors and more than 200
normal tissue samples and identified 15 genes specifically overexpressed
in breast cancer, of which one of the most prevalent was TRPS1. The
microarray findings were confirmed by in situ hybridization as well as
immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis of breast tumor cell lines.
Immunohistochemistry analysis found TRPS1 protein expressed in greater
than 90% of early- and late-stage breast cancer, including ductal
carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal, lobular, and papillary
carcinomas.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Momeni et al. (2000) identified 6 different nonsense mutations in the
TRPS1 gene (604386.0001-604386.0006) in 10 unrelated patients with
trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I (TRPS1; 190350). The findings
suggested that haploinsufficiency for this putative transcription factor
causes TRPS I.

To investigate whether trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type III (190351)
is caused by TRPS1 mutations and to establish a genotype-phenotype
correlation in TRPS, Ludecke et al. (2001) performed extensive mutation
analysis and evaluated height and degree of brachydactyly in patients
with TRPS I or TRPS III. They found 35 different mutations in 44 of 51
unrelated patients. The detection rate (86%) indicated that TRPS1 is the
major locus for TRPS I and TRPS III. They found no mutation in the
parents of sporadic patients or in apparently healthy relatives of
familial patients, indicating complete penetrance of TRPS1 mutations.
Evaluation of skeletal abnormalities of patients with TRPS1 mutations
revealed a wide clinical spectrum. The phenotype was variable in
unrelated, age- and sex-matched patients with identical mutations, as
well as in families. Four of the 5 missense mutations altered the GATA
DNA-binding zinc finger, and 6 of the 7 unrelated patients with these
mutations could be classified as having TRPS III, because they had
severe brachydactyly, due to short metacarpals, and severe short
stature. The data indicated that TRPS III is at the severe end of the
TRPS spectrum and that it is most often caused by a specific class of
mutations in exon 6 the TRPS1 gene. In the study of Ludecke et al.
(2001), 5 mutations were recurrent, and 4 of these were identified in
patients of different ethnicities: 1 in patients of Norwegian, Turkish,
and Belgian extraction, and another in patients of Belgian, Turkish, and
Japanese extraction, for example.

Kobayashi et al. (2002) identified a missense mutation in exon 6 of the
TRPS1 gene (604386.0009) in type III TRPS, reinforcing the conclusion of
Ludecke et al. (2001).

In cases of type III TRPS, Hilton et al. (2002) found 2 missense
mutations in the GATA DNA-binding zinc finger: R908Q (now R921Q;
604386.0009), a recurrent mutation, and A919V (now A932V; 604386.0010),
a de novo mutation.

In cases of type I TRPS, Kaiser et al. (2004) identified the first 2
missense mutations that do not affect the GATA zinc finger
(604386.0011-604386.0012).

Ludecke et al. (1995) presented evidence that the trichorhinophalangeal
syndrome type II, or Langer-Giedion syndrome (150230), is a contiguous
gene syndrome due to loss of functional copies of both the TRPS1 and
EXT1 (608177) genes.

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

Investigations have demonstrated that most patients with nonsense
mutations in the TRPS1 gene have the less severe TRPS type I phenotype
(Momeni et al., 2000; Hatamura et al., 2001), while patients with
missense mutations in the GATA-type zinc-finger region of the TRPS1 gene
have the more severe TRPS type III phenotype (Ludecke et al., 2001;
Hilton et al., 2002). Piccione et al. (2009) presented evidence
supporting this hypothesis. They reported 2 unrelated patients with TRPS
types I and III who had heterozygous nonsense and missense mutations,
respectively, in the TRPS1 gene. The patient with type I TRPS had
haploinsufficiency of TRPS1, whereas the patient with type III TRPS had
an allele causing functional modification of the GATA-type motif,
possibly inducing a dominant-negative effect on DNA transcription
regulation and leading to a more severe phenotype.

CYTOGENETICS

Fantauzzo et al. (2008) analyzed the cytogenetic breakpoints of 3
patients with hypertrichosis universalis congenita, Ambras type (HTC1;
145701), including patients ME-1 and SS-1, originally reported by
Baumeister et al. (1993) and Balducci et al. (1998), respectively. They
identified a pericentric inversion in chromosome 8q23.1 that lies 7.3 Mb
downstream of the TRPS1 gene in patient ME-1, a 6.7-Mb deletion that
encompasses the TRPS1 gene in patient SS-1, and a 1.5-Mb deletion in
chromosome 8q24.1 that lies 2.1 Mb upstream of the TRPS1 gene in patient
BN-1. There was no overlap between the breakpoints in the 3 patients, so
the authors defined the entire 11.5-Mb interval between markers RH62506
and D8S269 containing 20 genes, including the TRPS1 gene, as the
candidate interval. Southern blot analysis was suggestive of deletion of
TRPS1 in patient SS-1, and no RNA was available for patient BN-1.
Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated significant downregulation of TRPS1 in
patient ME-1, suggesting that the inversion breakpoint 7.3 Mb downstream
from the TRPS1 gene reduced expression, consistent with a position
effect. Fantauzzo et al. (2008) suggested that position effect causing
downregulation of TRPS1 expression is the probable cause of
hypertrichosis in Ambras syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Malik et al. (2002) reported that mice heterozygous for deletion of the
DNA-binding GATA domain of Trps1 (delta-GT mutation) displayed facial
anomalies that overlapped with findings for TRPS, whereas mice
homozygous for the delta-GT mutation additionally showed a complete
absence of vibrissae. Unexpectedly, homozygous delta-GT mice died of
neonatal respiratory failure resulting from abnormalities of the
thoracic spine and ribs. Delta-GT heterozygotes also developed thoracic
kyphoscoliosis with age and had structural deficits in cortical and
trabecular bones. The findings directly implicated the GATA-type zinc
finger of TRPS1 in regulation of bone and hair development and suggested
that skeletal abnormalities emphasized in descriptions of TRPS are only
the extreme manifestations of a generalized bone dysplasia.

Napierala et al. (2008) found that mice homozygous for the Trps1
delta-GT mutation showed elongation of the growth plate due to delayed
chondrocyte differentiation and abnormal mineralization of
perichondrium. These abnormalities were accompanied by increased Runx2
(600211) and Ihh (600726) expression and increased Ihh signaling.
Cotransfection experiments showed that wildtype Trps1 bound Runx2 and
repressed Runx2-mediated activation of a reporter plasmid. Double
heterozygosity for Trps1 delta-GT and a Runx2-null mutation rescued the
opposite growth plate phenotypes found in single mutants. Napierala et
al. (2008) concluded that TRPS1 and RUNX2 interact to regulate
chondrocyte and perichondrium development.

Fantauzzo et al. (2008) analyzed koala ('Koa') mice, which represent a
mouse model of hypertrichosis and have a semidominant, radiation-induced
chromosomal inversion near the mouse ortholog of Trps1, and found that
the proximal breakpoint of the Koa inversion is located 791 kb upstream
of the Trps1 gene. Quantitative RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and
immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Trps1 expression levels are
reduced in Koa mutant mice at the sites of pathology for the phenotype,
including muzzle and dorsal skin and cells surrounding the developing
vibrissae follicles. Fantauzzo et al. (2008) determined that the Koa
inversion created a new Sp1 binding site and translocated additional Sp1
binding sites within a highly conserved stretch spanning the proximal
breakpoint, providing a potential mechanism for a position effect.

Kobayashi et al. (2002) reported a Japanese family in which
trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type III (190351) segregated with a
2723G-A substitution in exon 6 of the TRPS1 gene, resulting in an

In a father and daughter from Portugal with TRPS I (190350), Kaiser et
al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for a 2854C-T transition in the
TRPS1 gene, resulting in an arg952-to-cys (R952C) substitution. The
mutation prevents the transport of the TRPS1 protein into the nucleus
and thus reduces the nuclear TRPS1 concentration, consistent with
haploinsufficiency.

TRICHORHINOPHALANGEAL SYNDROME, TYPE I
TRPS1, ARG952HIS

Based on a renumbering of the TRPS1 gene sequence, the mutation

610365	TITLE *610365 C1q- AND TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-RELATED PROTEIN 1; C1QTNF1
;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN; GIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the second intracellular loop of V2R (AVPR2; 300538) as bait in a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human kidney cDNA library, followed by RACE
of heart and HEK293 mRNA, Innamorati et al. (2002) cloned C1QTNF1, which
they called GIP. The deduced protein contains 379 amino acids. The
extracellular N terminus contains a TNF (see 191160) family
cysteine-rich region, followed by a transmembrane domain, a C-terminal
collagen-like sequence of 14 Gly-X-Y repeats, and a globular domain.
Northern blot analysis detected prominent expression in heart and lower
expression in placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, prostate and
ovary. Little to no expression was detected in other tissues examined.
In transfected HEK293 and COS cells, epitope-tagged GIP was expressed in
vesicular structures surrounding the nucleus and near the cell surface.
Western blot analysis detected epitope-tagged GIP at about 40 kD and 130
kD, suggesting GIP can form trimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay and pull-down experiments, Innamorati et
al. (2002) confirmed the interaction between the second intracellular
loop of V2R and the C-terminal portion of GIP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Innamorati et al. (2002) determined that the C1QTNF1 gene contains 3
coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Innamorati et al. (2002) mapped the
C1QTNF1 gene to chromosome 17q25.

194558	TITLE *194558 ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 83; ZNF83
DESCRIPTION 
MAPPING

Marine et al. (1994) assigned the ZNF83 gene (also known as HPF1) to
chromosome 19 by screening a human/rodent hybrid panel and localized the
gene further to 19q13.3-q13.4 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and
digital imaging microscopy.

HISTORY

Conserved structural motifs define large families of nucleic acid
binding proteins in eukaryotes. The C2H2-type zinc finger motif,
conferring both specific RNA and DNA binding activities, was first
detected within the amino acid sequence of the Xenopus transcription
factor IIIA (Miller et al., 1985). Thereafter, vertebrate genomes were
shown to encode hundreds of so-called zinc finger proteins (ZFPs).
Subfamilies were defined on the basis of conserved sequence elements
outside the finger repeat, such as the KRAB domain. Several members of
these subfamilies were found to have a clustered genomic organization.

KIAA0238
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The absorption of vitamin C into the body and its distribution to organs
requires the sodium-coupled vitamin C transporters SVCT1 (603790) and
SVCT2. SVCT1 is largely confined to epithelial surfaces involved in bulk
transport, such as those of the intestine and kidney, and is involved in
maintenance of whole-body homeostasis, through dietary absorption and
renal reabsorption. SVCT2 appears to account for tissue-specific uptake
of vitamin C. SVCT2 expression is widespread, occurring in neurons, the
endocrine system, bone, and other tissues, thus protecting metabolically
active tissues from oxidative stress (Hediger, 2002 and Savini et al.,
2008).

CLONING

During investigation of the importance of L-ascorbic acid transport in
regulating the supply and metabolism of vitamin C, Tsukaguchi et al.
(1999) isolated a 6.5-kb cDNA encoding a 592-amino acid protein, SVCT2,
from a rat brain cDNA library. This protein exhibits 65% amino acid
identity with rat SVCT1. SVCT2 is expressed in a host of metabolically
active cells and specialized tissues in the brain, eye, and other
organs. SVCT2 has 12 transmembrane domains, 2 possible sites for
N-glycosylation, and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.

As part of a project of sequencing human cDNA clones that correspond to
relatively long and nearly full-length transcripts, Nagase et al. (1996)
cloned KIAA0238, a 5,608-bp cDNA encoding a protein of 330 amino acids.
Tsukaguchi et al. (1999) determined that rat SVCT2 shares 84% amino acid
identity with KIAA0238 and stated that KIAA0238 may represent the human
homolog of SVCT2.

By searching for sequences similar to Aspergillus nidulans purine
transporters, followed by 5-prime RACE of a human kidney cDNA library,
Faaland et al. (1998) cloned SLC23A2, which they called YSPL2. The
deduced 650-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 70 kD.
It has 12 transmembrane domains, 2 blocks of similarity with
xanthine/uracil transporters, 2 potential N-glycosylation sites, and 3
putative phosphorylation sites. The N and C termini are predicted to be
intracellular. Northern blot analysis detected an 8-kb transcript in
heart, brain, placenta, liver, kidney, and pancreas. EST database
analysis indicated that YSPL2 is expressed in other human tissues and
cell types, particularly in fetal tissues.

Using SVCT1 (SLC23A1) to probe a human placenta cell line cDNA library,
Rajan et al. (1999) cloned SVCT2. Northern blot analysis detected a
major transcript of 7.5 kb highly expressed in brain, placenta, and
liver and more weakly expressed in heart, but not in lung or skeletal
muscle. Placenta expressed an additional transcript of 4.0 kb.

By PCR of a human fetal brain cDNA library, Lutsenko et al. (2004)
cloned a splice variant of SVCT2 that encodes a truncated protein
lacking the last 115 amino acids, including intracellular domains 5 and
6 and part of domain 4. PCR analysis detected the short variant in all
adult and fetal tissues examined. The long and short SVCT2 variants were
expressed in transfected human embryonic kidney cells as proteins of
about 80 and 70 kD, respectively.

By RT-PCR, Rubin et al. (2005) showed that several human cell lines
preferentially expressed SVCT2 from the exon 1b promoter compared to the
exon 1a promoter but that the ratio of preference varied widely.

GENE FUNCTION

By assaying transport activity in transfected human retinal pigment
epithelial cells, Rajan et al. (1999) showed that SVCT2 specifically
transported radiolabeled ascorbate, but not any other vitamin tested.
Transport was saturable and completely dependent upon extracellular Na+.
Kinetic analysis revealed that the relationship between ascorbate uptake
and Na+ concentration was sigmoidal, indicating that for every ascorbate
molecule transported, 2 Na+ ions were cotransported.

By cotransfection in human embryonic kidney cells, Lutsenko et al.
(2004) showed that the C-terminally truncated isoform of SVCT2 inhibited
ascorbic acid transport by the longer isoform in a dose-dependent manner
and that inhibition was due to direct protein-protein interaction
between the short and long variants. By examining the level of
endogenous short and long variants in human cell lines, Lutsenko et al.
(2004) found that the ability of cells to transport ascorbic acid was
inversely proportional to the amount of short isoform expressed.

GENE STRUCTURE

Rubin et al. (2005) identified alternative exons 1a and 1b of the
SLC23A2 gene that are separated by about 8.8 kb and have upstream
promoter sequences. The promoter upstream of exon 1b is TATA- and
CAAT-less and has a GC content of 73%. Rubin et al. (2005) identified
several specific transcription factor binding sites in both promoter
regions and determined that translation start site is in exon 3.

Savini et al. (2008) stated that the SLC23A2 gene contains 17 exons and
spans 158.4 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of a radiation hybrid mapping panel, Nagase et al. (1996)
mapped the SLC23A2 gene to human chromosome 20. By genomic sequence
analysis, Faaland et al. (1998) mapped the SLC23A2 gene to chromosome
20p13-p12.

;;MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; MRP1;;
MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; MRP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cole et al. (1992) identified a transporter protein whose gene is
overexpressed in a multidrug-resistant variant of the small cell lung
cancer cell line NCI-H69. Unlike most tumor cell lines that are
resistant to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, it did not overexpress
the transmembrane transport protein P-glycoprotein (MDR1; 171050). Cole
et al. (1992) isolated cDNA clones corresponding to mRNAs overexpressed
in the resistant H69 cells. One cDNA hybridized to an mRNA of 7.8 to 8.2
kb that was expressed 100- to 200-fold higher in the resistant cells
than in the drug-sensitive H69 cells. Overexpression was associated with
amplification of the cognate gene. The cDNA contained a single open
reading frame of 1,522 amino acids encoding a protein that they
designated MRP, for 'multidrug resistance-associated protein.' (Cole and
Deeley (1993) corrected the predicted protein sequence to 1,531 amino
acids.) Database analyses demonstrated similarities in primary sequence
to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily
of transport systems. Included in this superfamily are the genes for
MDR1 and for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR; 602421). Northern blot analysis readily detected MRP transcripts
in lung, testis, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells; MRP transcripts
were below the level of detection in placenta, brain, kidney, salivary
gland, uterus, liver, and spleen.

GENE FUNCTION

Zaman et al. (1994) described experiments leading them to conclude that
MRP is a plasma membrane drug-efflux pump.

Lorico et al. (2002) showed that glutathione is a cofactor in
MRP-mediated resistance to heavy metal oxyanions: human fibrosarcoma
cells overexpressing MRP1 together with the heavy (catalytic) subunit of
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (606857) showed increased resistance
to sodium arsenite and antimony toxicity.

Using flow cytometric analysis, Muller et al. (2002) found that when a
FLAG epitope was introduced into the extracellular loops of
membrane-spanning domain-1 (MSD1) or MSD3 of MRP1, it was accessible on
the cell surface upon removal of N-glycosylation sites. In contrast,
FLAG epitope inserted into MSD2 was not accessible even after removal of
all 3 N-glycosylation sites, indicating that MSD2 is deeply buried in
the plasma membrane.

Using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, Pascolo et al. (2003) found that
MRP1 and MRP3 (ABCC3; 604323) were highly expressed in placenta, but
only MRP1 was highly expressed in a trophoblastic cell line. MRP2
(ABCC2; 601107) and MRP5 (ABCC5; 605251) were only weakly expressed in
placenta and the trophoblastic cell line. Third-trimester placenta
expressed more MRP1 than first-trimester placenta. MRP1 expression
increased markedly in the trophoblastic cell line upon polarization.
Pascolo et al. (2003) concluded that MRP1 expression increases with
trophoblast maturation.

In cultured mouse astrocytes, Gennuso et al. (2004) found that
unconjugated bilirubin induced increased expression and transient
redistribution of Mrp1 from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane
and throughout the cytoplasm. Blocking Mrp1 efflux pumps increased the
susceptibility of the cells to the toxic effects of unconjugated
bilirubin, suggesting that Mrp1 is an important protector in this
scenario. The authors noted the relevance of the findings to neonatal
encephalopathy caused by increased bilirubin.

Mitra et al. (2006) found that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) was
released from mast cells independently of degranulation. S1P secretion
was dependent on ABCC1, but not on ABCB1 (171050), and inhibition of
ABCC1 blocked both constitutive and antigen-stimulated S1P release.
Chemotaxis assays showed that ABCC1-mediated transport of S1P influenced
mast-cell migration, but not mast-cell degranulation.

The reactivation of latent human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection after
transplantation is associated with high morbidity and mortality. In
vivo, myeloid cells and their progenitors are an important site of HCMV
latency, whose establishment and/or maintenance require expression of
the viral transcript UL138. Weekes et al. (2013) used stable isotope
labeling by amino acids in cell culture-based mass spectrometry to
identify a dramatic UL138-mediated loss of cell surface MRP1 and the
reduction of substrate export by this transporter. Latency-associated
loss of MRP1 and accumulation of the cytotoxic drug vincristine, an MRP1
substrate, depleted virus from naturally latent CD14+ (158120) and CD34+
(142230) progenitors, all of which are in vivo sites of latency. Weekes
et al. (2013) concluded that the UL138-mediated loss of MRP1 provides a
marker for detecting latent HCMV infection and a therapeutic target for
eliminating latently infected cells before transplantation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Grant et al. (1997) defined the intron/exon structure of MRP and
characterized a number of splicing variants of MRP mRNA. The gene spans
at least 200 kb. It contains 31 exons and a high proportion of class 0
introns, alternative splicing of which results in significant levels of
variant transcripts that maintain the original open reading frame of MRP
mRNA. (A class 0 splice occurs between 2 codons, e.g., ATG/ATG =
Met.Met. A class 1 splice would be ATGA/TG and a class 2 splice would be
ATGAT/G.) Analyses of the conservation of intron/exon organization and
protein primary structure suggested that the MRP-related transporters
evolved from a common ancestor shared with CFTR by fusion with 1 or more
genes encoding polytopic membrane proteins.

MAPPING

By isotopic in situ hybridization, Cole et al. (1992) mapped the MRP1
gene to chromosome 16p13.1. Grant et al. (1997) located the MRP1 gene
close to the short arm breakpoint of the pericentric inversion
associated with the M4Eo subclass of acute myeloid leukemia and on the
telomeric side of the MYH11 gene (160745).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using PCR-SSCP analysis, Conrad et al. (2001) screened 36 Caucasian
volunteers for mutations in the coding exons of the MRP1 gene, including
the adjacent intron sequences. Among several changes found, 2 were
predicted to cause amino acid substitutions. One of these mutations,
G671V, was of special interest because it is located near the first
nucleotide-binding domain. To determine whether this mutation caused a
change in the MRP1 phenotype, a mutant MRP1 expression vector was
constructed and transfected into SV40-transformed human embryonic kidney
cells and the transport properties of the mutant protein were examined.
With the substrates studied, the mutant showed no differences in organic
anion transport activities compared to wildtype MRP1.

Wang et al. (2005) scanned for genomic signatures of recent positive
selection in MRP1 in approximately 480 individuals sampled from the
Chinese, Malay, Indian, European American, and African American
populations. The genetic profile of SNPs at this locus revealed high
haplotype diversity and weak linkage disequilibrium (LD). Despite this
weak LD, the G allele of the -260G-C SNP (dbSNP rs4148330) in the
promoter region of the MRP1 gene, which was contained within a
high-frequency haplotype, exhibited extended haplotype homozygosity
across 135 kb in European Americans. Long-range haplotype and F(st)
statistic tests showed evidence of positive selection for the G allele
in the European American population. An MRP1 promoter-reporter assay
showed significantly lower activity for the G allele-containing promoter
when compared with the C allele-containing promoter in all 4 cell lines
tested (P = less than 0.01). Wang et al. (2005) suggested that dbSNP
rs4148330 may account, in part, for interindividual variations and
population differences in drug response.

ANIMAL MODEL

Robbiani et al. (2000) showed that migration of dendritic cells (DCs)
from skin to lymph nodes utilizes the leukotriene C4 (LTC4; see 246530)
transporter MRP1. DC mobilization from the epidermis and trafficking
into lymphatic vessels was greatly reduced in Mrp1 -/- mice, but
migration was restored by exogenous cysteinyl leukotrienes LTC4 or LTD4.
In vitro, these cysteinyl leukotrienes promoted optimal chemotaxis to
the chemokine CCL19 (SCYA19; 602227) but not to other related
chemokines. Antagonism of CCL19 in vivo prevented DC migration out of
the epidermis. Thus, the authors concluded that MRP1 regulates DC
migration to lymph nodes, apparently by transporting LTC4, which in turn
promotes chemotaxis to CCL19 and mobilization of DCs from the epidermis.

Schultz et al. (2001) showed that Mrp1-deficient mice had diminished
outgrowth of Streptococcus pneumoniae and strongly reduced mortality
compared with wildtype mice after intranasal infection. This advantage
could be abrogated by treatment with a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Mutant
mice had low levels of LTC4 in lung because of accumulation of
intracellular LTC4 and inhibition of LTC4 synthase. On the other hand,
they had a reduced inflammatory response and high levels of LTB4 (see
LTB4R2; 605773), which was associated with increased LTA4 hydrolase
(151570) activity and was required for the protective effect. Schultz et
al. (2001) suggested that MRP1 may be a novel target for adjunctive
therapy in pneumonia.

Lorico et al. (2002) found resistance to heavy metal oxyanion toxicity
in cell cultures overexpressing MRP1, but no increase in sensitivity to
sodium arsenite and antimony in Mrp1 -/- knockout mice. The authors
stated that the redundancy of transmembrane export pumps suggests that
other pump(s) may effectively vicariate for MRP1-mediated transport of
heavy metal oxyanions.

602559	TITLE *602559 EXPORTIN 1; XPO1
;;REQUIRED FOR CHROMOSOME REGION MAINTENANCE; CRM1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Human CRM1, or XPO1, is the homolog of yeast crm1 (named for 'required
for chromosome region maintenance'), a nuclear protein essential for
proliferation and chromosome region maintenance. Fornerod et al. (1997)
used the oncogenic nucleoporin CAN (114350) to coprecipitate human CRM1.
The complete cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 1,071 amino acids with
a predicted molecular mass of 123 kD. The CRM1 protein migrates at 112
kD. Human CRM1 has 47% identity with S. cerevisiae crm1 and 52% identity
with S. pombe crm1+. The N terminus of human CRM1 shares significant
homology with the N terminus of importin-beta. Fornerod et al. (1997)
identified a group of largely uncharacterized yeast and vertebrate
proteins of similar size (110 to 120 kD) that share this homology
domain, which they proposed to call the CRIME domain (for 'CRM1,
importin-beta, etc.').

Kudo et al. (1997) cloned human CRM1 cDNA using sequence information
from EST databases and a PCR-based strategy based on the sequence of S.
pombe crm1+. Northern blot analysis using the C-terminal region of human
CRM1 cDNA as a probe revealed a major transcript of 5.6 kb expressed in
all tissues tested except kidney.

GENE FUNCTION

Kudo et al. (1997) found that Human CRM1 weakly complemented the
cold-sensitive mutation of S. pombe crm1-809. Overproduction of human
CRM1 suppressed cell proliferation in wildtype S. pombe in an expression
level-dependent manner. Overexpression of native S. pombe crm1+ had the
same effect. Northern blot analysis with RNAs isolated from synchronized
mammalian cells showed that the expression of mammalian CRM1 was
initiated in the late G1 phase and reached a peak at G2/M, although the
protein level did not change during the cell cycle. Human CRM1 fused to
green fluorescent protein (GFP) and transiently expressed in NIH 3T3
cells showed that human CRM1 was localized preferentially in the nuclear
envelope, but was also detectable in the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.
A crm1 mutation of S. pombe caused nuclear import of a GFP fusion
protein containing a nuclear export signal (NES) but no change in the
distribution of a GFP fusion protein containing a nuclear localization
signal (NLS). These data suggested to Kudo et al. (1997) that CRM1 is a
novel cell cycle-regulated gene that is essential for the NES-dependent
nuclear export of proteins.

CRM1 protein binds CAN and NUP88 (602552), and its association with the
nuclear pore is dynamic (Fornerod et al., 1997). To test whether CRM1
could be a nuclear export receptor, Fornerod et al. (1997) used Xenopus
oocytes incubated in leptomycin B, a cytotoxin which blocks Rev export
and Rev-mediated RNA export in tissue culture cells. Leptomycin B
interacted directly with CRM1, as shown by gel shift assays, and blocked
export of Rev and U snRNAs from Xenopus oocyte nucleus. Overexpression
of CRM1 stimulated Rev and U snRNA export from the nucleus. Fornerod et
al. (1997) found that an NES/CRM1/Ran complex forms in the presence of
RanGTP. Leptomycin B blocks formation of this complex. Fornerod et al.
(1997) concluded that CRM1 is an export receptor for leucine-rich NESs.
Noting that CRM1 is a member of a family of proteins related to
importin-beta, Fornerod et al. (1997) suggested the descriptive name
'exportins' for those family members involved in nuclear export.

Stade et al. (1997) characterized CRM1 as an essential nuclear export
factor in S. cerevisiae and proposed that CRM1 be renamed 'exportin-1,'
symbolized XPO1. XPO1 protein is localized in the nucleus at steady
state but is capable of shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm.
Stade et al. (1997) constructed an NES-GFP-NLS substrate which shuttled
continuously between the nucleus and cytoplasm, but appeared largely
cytoplasmic, presumably due to a higher rate of export. In yeast
containing a temperature-sensitive mutation in CRM1, the substrate
became nuclear within 5 minutes at high temperature, indicating that the
mutation blocks NES export. High temperature also blocked mRNA export in
yeast. A 2-hybrid analysis showed an interaction between NES and CRM1
and between Ran and CRM1.

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(KIP1) (CDKN1B; 600778) is
degraded during the cell cycle by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
Using NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Kamura
et al. (2004) found that a complex made up of Kpc1 (RNF123; 614472) and
Kpc2 (UBAC1; 608129) ubiquitinated cytoplasmic p27(KIP1) at G1 phase and
that cytoplasmic degradation of p27(KIP1) required p27(KIP1) nuclear
export by Crm1.

A single transcript in its unspliced and spliced forms directs synthesis
of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 proteins. Although nuclear
export of intron-containing cellular transcripts is restricted in
mammalian cells, HIV-1 has evolved the viral Rev protein to overcome
this restriction for viral transcripts. CRM1 is a cellular cofactor for
Rev-dependent export of intron-containing HIV-1 RNA. Yedavalli et al.
(2004) presented evidence that Rev/CRM1 activity uses the ATP-dependent
RNA helicase DDX3 (300160). They showed that DDX3 is a nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling protein that binds CRM1 and localizes to nuclear membrane
pores. Knockdown of DDX3 using either antisense vector or
dominant-negative mutants suppressed Rev-RRE (Rev response element)
function in the export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 RNAs. Yedavalli et
al. (2004) concluded that DDX3 is the human RNA helicase that functions
in the CRM1 RNA export pathway analogously to the postulated role for
Dbp5 (605812) in yeast mRNA export.

For a review of nuclear export receptors, see Ullman et al. (1997).

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Dong et al. (2009) presented a 2.9-angstrom resolution crystal structure
of CRM1 bound to snurportin (SNUPN1; 607902). Snurportin-1 binds CRM1 in
a bipartite manner by means of an N-terminal leucine-rich nuclear export
signal (LR-NES) and its nucleotide-binding domain. The LR-NES is a
combined alpha-helical-extended structure that occupies a hydrophobic
groove between 2 CRM1 outer helices. The LR-NES interface explains the
consensus hydrophobic pattern, preference for intervening
electronegative residues, and inhibition by leptomycin B. The second
nuclear export signal epitope is a basic surface on the snurportin-1
nucleotide-binding domain, which binds an acidic patch on CRM1 adjacent
to the LR-NES site. Multipartite recognition of individually weak
nuclear export signal epitopes may be common to CRM1 substrates,
enhancing CRM1 binding beyond the generally low affinity LR-NES. Similar
energetic construction is also used in multipartite nuclear localization
signals to provide broad substrate specificity and rapid evolution in
nuclear transport.

Monecke et al. (2009) presented the crystal structure of the
SPN1-CRM1-RanGTP (see 601179) export complex at 2.5-angstrom resolution.
SPN1 is a nuclear import adapter for cytoplasmically assembled, m3G
(5-prime-2,2,7-terminal trimethylguanosine)-capped spliceosomal U
snRNPs. The structure showed how CRM1 can specifically return the
cargo-free form of SPN1 to the cytoplasm. The extensive contact area
includes 5 hydrophobic residues at the SPN1 amino terminus that dock
into a hydrophobic cleft of CRM1, as well as numerous hydrophilic
contacts of CRM1 to m3G cap-binding domain and carboxyl-terminal
residues of SPN1. Monecke et al. (2009) concluded that RanGTP promotes
cargo binding to CRM1 solely through long-range conformational changes
in the exportin.

MAPPING

The CRM1 gene maps to human chromosome 2p16 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (Fornerod et al., 1997).

614277	TITLE *614277 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME 2W; UBE2W
;;UBC16, ARABIDOPSIS, HOMOLOG OF; UBC16
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitination is a common posttranslational modification that plays
roles in many cellular pathways and in protein degradation. Conjugation
of ubiquitin to substrate proteins requires an E1 ubiquitin-activating
enzyme (e.g., UBE1; 314370), an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e.g.,
UBE2A; 312180), and an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (e.g., UBE3A;
601623). UBE2W is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (summary by Zhang
et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a human fetal brain cDNA library, Yin
et al. (2006) cloned UBE2W, which they called UBC16. The deduced
162-amino acid protein has an approximately 150-amino acid catalytic
core, termed the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) domain, which
contains 2 nuclear localization signals at its C-terminal end. Human
UBC16 shares 51% amino acid identity with Arabidopsis Ubc16. RT-PCR
detected ubiquitous UBC16 expression, with highest expression in heart,
brain, liver, and pancreas. Fluorescence-tagged UBC16 localized to
nuclei of transfected HEK293 cells.

GENE FUNCTION

By mutation analysis, Yin et al. (2006) showed that nuclear localization
of human UBC in transfected HEK293 cells required both the nuclear
localization signals and enzyme activity.

Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Zhang et al. (2011) showed that mouse
Ube2w interacted with Fancl (608111), an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in
DNA damage repair. They confirmed the interaction by protein pull-down
and coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Fancl showed a ubiquitous
intracellular localization in the absence of Ube2w and a nuclear
localization in the presence of Ube2w. Ube2w formed nuclear homodimers.
Ube2w exhibited ubiquitin-conjugating activity and monoubiquitinated the
PHD domain of Fancl in vitro. Ubiquitination by Ube2w required a
conserved active-site cysteine within its ubiquitin-conjugating domain.
Ube2w also monoubiquitinated Fancd2 (613984). Downregulation of UBE2W in
human cell lines markedly reduced FANCD2 monoubiquitination caused by
ultraviolet irradiation, but not FANCD2 monoubiquitination caused by the
DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C or FANCD2 monoubiquitination that
occurs normally during S phase.

GENE STRUCTURE

Yin et al. (2006) determined that the UBE2W gene contains 7 exons and
spans 8.6 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Yin et al. (2006) mapped the UBE2W gene to
chromosome 8q13-q21.1.

;;HPAII TINY FRAGMENTS LOCUS 9C; HTF9C
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) cloned mouse Htf9c, which encodes a deduced
676-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 75 kD. Htf9c
has a putative N-terminal nuclear targeting signal and a C-terminal
domain similar to yeast and bacterial nucleic acid-modifying enzymes.

GENE FUNCTION

Guarguaglini et al. (1997) found that mouse Htf9c and Ranbp1 (601180)
were divergently transcribed from a bidirectional promoter. Expression
of both genes was activated upon entry into the cell cycle, peaked in S
phase, and was downregulated during completion of the cell cycle. The
bidirectional promoter was downregulated in both orientations in
arrested cells. Activation of the promoter was specific, resulting in
more restricted Htf9c expression and a sharper peak of Htf9c expression
in S phase compared with Ranbp1 expression. A region containing an E2f
(189971) site was important for cell cycle control of Htf9c, and a
common region containing sites for Sp1 (189906) and E2f contributed to
activation in both orientations.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the HTF9C gene to chromosome 22q11.21 based on an
alignment of the TRMT2A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK025106) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

614405	TITLE *614405 DEAH BOX POLYPEPTIDE 33; DHX33
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the DEAD/DEAH box family of RNA helicases, such as DHX33,
modify the higher-order structure of RNA through hydrolysis of ATP or
other nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). These enzymes have a role in RNA
transcription, RNA editing, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and
RNA decay (summary by Zhang et al., 2011).

CLONING

Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed by RNA polymerase I (see POLR1B;
602000) as a 47S polycistronic precursor that is processed into mature
18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs. Using an RNA interference screen to identify
DDX/DHX enzymes that perturb rRNA transcription in human fibroblasts,
Zhang et al. (2011) identified DHX33. The deduced protein contains an
N-terminal ATP/NTP-binding domain, a central ATP/NTPase domain, and
C-terminal helicase and ATP/NTP hydrolysis-dependent substrate
interaction motifs. Fractionation of a human breast cancer cell line and
human and mouse fibroblasts, as well as immunohistochemical analysis,
revealed that DHX33 localized predominantly with markers of nucleoli,
with some localization in nucleoplasm. Following dispersal of nucleoli
during the cell cycle, DHX33 followed nucleolar proteins to nucleolar
organizing regions.

GENE FUNCTION

Zhang et al. (2011) found that knockdown of DHX33 in human cell lines
inhibited rRNA transcription and processing, reduced the size of
nucleoli, caused nucleolar stress, and initiated a p53 (TP53;
191170)-dependent stress response that included cell cycle arrest and
induction of p21 (CDKN1A; 116899). Mutation analysis revealed that lys94
(K94) within the catalytic domain of DHX33 was crucial for rRNA
transcription. DHX33 deficiency reduced recruitment of the large RNA
polymerase subunit RPA194 (POLR1A) to rDNA loci and reduced
phosphorylation of UBF (UBTF; 600673), which is required for RNA
polymerase I activity. Overexpression of wildtype DHX33, but not DHX33
with a K94 mutation, in human cell lines stimulated 47S synthesis.
Overexpression of DHX33 with deletion of its putative DNA-binding domain
also reduced rRNA synthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of
human breast cancer cells revealed that DHX33, like RPA194, occupied the
entire rDNA promoter and transcribed regions, and binding required the
DNA-binding motif of DHX33. DHX33 also immunoprecipitated with UBF.
Zhang et al. (2011) concluded that DHX33 has a critical role in cell
growth and rRNA synthesis.

MAPPING

Hartz (2011) mapped the DHX33 gene to chromosome 17p13.2 based on an
alignment of the DHX33 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AL359945) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

606767	TITLE *606767 POTASSIUM CHANNEL, VOLTAGE-GATED, SUBFAMILY G, MEMBER 3; KCNG3
;;KV6.3;;
KV10.1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Voltage-gated potassium channels play an essential role in controlling
cellular excitability in the nervous system. These channels are
multimeric proteins containing alpha subunits, which are directly
responsible for channel activity, and gamma subunits, which modify the
basic channel activity. Kv6.3 functions as a gamma subunit.

CLONING

Using primers derived from a genomic fragment showing homology to Kv6.2
(605696), Sano et al. (2002) cloned Kv6.3 from a human brain cDNA
library. Kv6.3 encodes a deduced 437-amino acid sequence with a
predicted molecular mass of 49 kD. It shares 34% sequence identity with
Kv6.2 and 95.1% identity with the rat ortholog, Kv6.3. The protein
contains a pore forming domain and 6 transmembrane domains. RT-PCR
analysis demonstrated high expression of human Kv6.3 in various regions
of the brain. RT-PCR analysis in rat demonstrated that Kv6.3 is
specifically expressed in neuronal cells.

By PCR, Ottschytsch et al. (2002) cloned KCNG3, which they called
Kv10.1, from a brain cDNA library. The deduced protein contains 436
amino acids. PCR analysis detected strongest expression in pancreas and
testis and lower levels in brain, lung, kidney, thymus, ovary, small
intestine, and colon.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation studies, Sano et al. (2002) demonstrated
interaction between Kv6.3 and Kv2.1 (600397) in cotransfected COS-7
cells. Electrophysiologic analysis of transiently transfected murine
fibroblasts showed that Kv6.3 does not form a functional voltage-gated
ion channel when expressed alone. When Kv6.3 is coexpressed with Kv2.1,
a heteromultimeric channel is formed that shows a decreased rate of
deactivation compared to the channel formed by Kv2.1 alone. Thus, Kv6.3
appears to function as a modulatory subunit.

Ottschytsch et al. (2002) found no potassium currents when KCNG3 was
expressed alone, while coexpression with Kv2.1 in mouse fibroblasts
resulted in altered Kv2.1 channel properties. By yeast 2-hybrid analysis
using the N-terminal segment of KCNG3 containing the NAB domain, which
regulates coassembly, Ottschytsch et al. (2002) found no
homotetramerization between KCNG3 molecules. Immunoprecipitation
analysis using full-length proteins confirmed interaction between KCNG3
and Kv2.1. By confocal microscopy, Ottschytsch et al. (2002) showed that
KCNG3 was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when expressed alone,
and it redistributed to the plasma membrane when expressed with Kv2.1.
Ottschytsch et al. (2002) concluded that Kv2.1 promotes the trafficking
of KCNG3 and other regulatory subunits to the cell surface, presumably
by forming heterotetrameric channels.

GENE STRUCTURE

Sano et al. (2002) determined that the Kv6.3 gene contains 2 exons
spanning 49 kb of genomic DNA.

MAPPING

Sano et al. (2002) mapped the Kv6.3 gene within a genomic clone
localized to chromosome 2. By genomic sequence analysis, Ottschytsch et
al. (2002) mapped the KCNG3 gene to chromosome 2p21.

CLONING

Varon et al. (1998) described the positional cloning of a gene encoding
a novel protein, termed nibrin, that mapped within a 300-kb critical
region for Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS; 251260) on chromosome 8q21.
Northern blot analysis revealed mRNA transcripts of 2.4 and 4.4 kb in
all tissues examined. The predicted 754-amino acid protein contains 2
domains found in cell cycle checkpoint proteins, a forkhead-associated
domain and an adjacent breast cancer carboxy-terminal domain.

Carney et al. (1998) independently isolated the gene for NBS. They
characterized the gene encoding p95, a member of the MRE11/RAD50
double-strand break (DSB) repair complex. Comparison of the p95 cDNA to
the NBS1 cDNA of Varon et al. (1998) indicated that the p95 and NBS1
genes are identical.

Matsuura et al. (1998) reported the positional cloning of the gene
responsible for the Nijmegen breakage syndrome, NBS1, from an 800-kb
candidate region. They found that the gene is expressed at high levels
in testis, suggesting that it may be involved in meiotic recombination.

GENE FUNCTION

The MRE11/RAD50 DSB repair complex consists of 5 proteins: p95 (NBS1),
p200, p400, MRE11, and RAD50 (604040). Carney et al. (1998) found that
p95 was absent from NBS cells established from NBS patients and that p95
deficiency in these cells completely abrogated the formation of
MRE11/RAD50 ionizing radiation-induced foci. The implication of the
MRE11/RAD50/p95 protein complex in NBS reveals a direct molecular link
between DSB repair and cell cycle checkpoint functions.

Zhong et al. (1999) demonstrated association of BRCA1 (113705) with the
RAD50/MRE11/p95 complex. Upon irradiation, BRCA1 was detected in the
nucleus, in discrete foci which colocalize with RAD50. Formation of
irradiation-induced foci positive for BRCA1, RAD50, MRE11, or p95 was
dramatically reduced in HCC/1937 breast cancer cells carrying a
homozygous mutation in BRCA1 but was restored by transfection of
wildtype BRCA1. Ectopic expression of wildtype, but not mutated, BRCA1
in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the DNA damage agent
methyl methanesulfonate. These data suggested to the authors that BRCA1
is important for the cellular responses to DNA damage that are mediated
by the RAD50-MRE11-p95 complex.

Wang et al. (2000) used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry
analyses to identify BRCA1-associated proteins. They found that BRCA1 is
part of a large multisubunit protein complex of tumor suppressors, DNA
damage sensors, and signal transducers. They named this complex BASC,
for 'BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex.' Among the DNA repair
proteins identified in the complex were ATM (607585), BLM (604610), MSH2
(609309), MSH6 (600678), MLH1 (120436), the RAD50-MRE11-NBS1 complex,
and the RFC1 (102579)-RFC2 (600404)-RFC4 (102577) complex. Confocal
microscopy demonstrated that BRCA1, BLM, and the RAD50-MRE11-NBS1
complex colocalize to large nuclear foci. Wang et al. (2000) suggested
that BASC may serve as a sensor of abnormal DNA structures and/or as a
regulator of the postreplication repair process.

Because of the similarities between ataxia-telangiectasia (AT; 208900)
and Nijmegen breakage syndrome, Lim et al. (2000) evaluated the
functional interactions between the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM;
607585) and NBS1 genes. Activation of the ATM kinase by ionizing
radiation and induction of ATM-dependent responses in NBS cells
indicated that NBS1 may not be required for signaling to ATM after
ionizing radiation. However, NBS1 was phosphorylated on serine-343 in an
ATM-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo after ionizing radiation. An
NBS1 construct mutated at the ATM phosphorylation site abrogated an
S-phase checkpoint induced by ionizing radiation in normal cells and
failed to compensate for this functional deficiency in NBS cells. These
observations linked ATM and NBS1 in a common signaling pathway and
provided an explanation for the phenotypic similarities between the 2
disorders.

Gatei et al. (2000) demonstrated that nibrin is phosphorylated within 1
hour of treatment of cells with ionizing radiation. This response was
abrogated in AT cells that either do not express ATM protein or express
near full-length mutant protein. Gatei et al. (2000) also showed that
ATM physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine-343
both in vivo and in vitro. Phosphorylation of this site appears to be
functionally important because mutated nibrin (S343A) does not
completely complement radiosensitivity in NBS cells. ATM phosphorylation
of nibrin does not affect nibrin-MRE11-RAD50 association, as revealed by
radiation-induced foci formation. Gatei et al. (2000) concluded that
their data provide a biochemical explanation for the similarity in
phenotype between AT and NBS.

Zhao et al. (2000) demonstrated that phosphorylation of NBS1, induced by
ionizing radiation, requires catalytically active ATM. Complexes
containing ATM and NBS1 exist in vivo in both untreated cells and cells
treated with ionizing radiation. Zhao et al. (2000) identified 2
residues of NBS1, serine-278 and serine-343, that are phosphorylated in
vitro by ATM and whose modification in vivo is essential for the
cellular response to DNA damage. This response includes S-phase
checkpoint activation, formation of the NBS1/Mre11/Rad50 nuclear foci,
and rescue of hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Zhao et al. (2000)
concluded that together, these results demonstrated a biochemical link
between cell cycle checkpoints activated by DNA damage and DNA repair in
2 genetic diseases with overlapping phenotypes.

Zhu et al. (2000) showed by coimmunoprecipitation that a small fraction
of RAD50, MRE11, and NBS1 is associated with the telomeric
repeat-binding factor TRF2 (602027). Indirect immunofluorescence
demonstrated the presence of RAD50 and MRE11 at interphase telomeres.
NBS1 was associated with TRF2 and telomeres in S phase, but not in G1 or
G2. Although the MRE11 complex accumulated in irradiation-induced foci
(IRIFs) in response to gamma-irradiation, TRF2 did not relocate to IRIFs
and irradiation did not affect the association of TRF2 with the MRE11
complex, arguing against a role for TRF2 in double-strand break repair.
Zhu et al. (2000) proposed that the MRE11 complex functions at
telomeres, possibly by modulating t-loop formation.

Lombard and Guarente (2000) showed that p95 and MRE11 are specifically
present on telomeres during meiosis. They suggested that p95 and MRE11
may have a role in telomere maintenance in mammals, analogous to the
role their homologs play in yeast.

Wu et al. (2000) reported that NBS is specifically phosphorylated in
response to gamma-radiation, ultraviolet light, and exposure to
hydroxyurea. Phosphorylation of NBS mediated by gamma-radiation, but not
that induced by hydroxyurea or ultraviolet light, was markedly reduced
in ATM cells. In vivo, NBS was phosphorylated on many serine residues,
of which serine-343, serine-397, and serine-615 were phosphorylated by
ATM in vitro. At least 2 of these sites were underphosphorylated in ATM
cells. Inactivation of these serines by mutation partially abrogated
ATM-dependent phosphorylation. Reconstituting NBS cells with a mutant
form of NBS that cannot be phosphorylated at selected ATM-dependent
serine residues led to a specific reduction in clonogenic survival after
gamma-radiation. Wu et al. (2000) concluded that phosphorylation of NBS
by ATM is critical for certain responses of human cells to DNA damage.

Wilda et al. (2000) studied the expression of Nbs1 in mouse embryos at
different developmental stages as well as in adult mice. Although a low
level of expression was observed in all tissues, highly specific
expression was observed in organs with physiologic DNA double-strand
breakage (DSB), such as testis, thymus, and spleen. Enhanced expression
was also found at sites of high proliferative activity: the
subventricular layer of the telencephalon and diencephalon, the liver,
lung, kidney, and gut, as well as striated and smooth muscle cells in
various organs. In the adult cerebellum, the postmitotic Purkinje cells
were marked specifically. The authors hypothesized that in addition to
the role of the Nbs1 gene product as part of a DNA DSB repair complex,
the Nbs1 gene product may serve further functions during development.

Chen et al. (2000) reported that the NBS1 protein and histone gamma-H2AX
(601772), which associate with irradiation-induced DNA DSBs, are also
found at sites of V(D)J (variable, diversity, joining)
recombination-induced DSBs. In developing thymocytes, NBS1 and
gamma-H2AX form nuclear foci that colocalize with the T-cell
receptor-alpha (TCRA; see 186880) locus in response to
recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG1; 179615) protein-mediated V(D)J
cleavage. Chen et al. (2000) concluded that their results suggest that
surveillance of T-cell receptor recombination intermediates by NBS1 and
gamma-H2AX may be important for preventing oncogenic translocations.

Class switch recombination (CSR) is a region-specific DNA recombination
reaction that replaces one immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant region
gene with another. This enables a single variable region gene to be used
in conjunction with different downstream heavy-chain genes, each having
a unique biologic activity. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID;
605257), a putative RNA editing enzyme, is required for this action.
Petersen et al. (2001) reported that the Nijmegen breakage syndrome
protein and gamma-H2AX, which facilitate DNA double-strand break repair,
form nuclear foci at the heavy-chain constant region in the G1 phase of
the cell cycle in cells undergoing class switch recombination. Class
switch recombination is impaired in H2AX -/- mice. Localization of NBS1
and gamma-H2AX to the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus during class
switch recombination is dependent on AID. In addition, AID is required
for induction of switch region-specific DNA lesions that precede class
switch recombination. Petersen et al. (2001) concluded that AID
functions upstream of the DNA modifications that initiate class switch
recombination.

Falck et al. (2002) demonstrated that experimental blockade of either
the NBS1-MRE11 function or the CHK2 (604373)-triggered events leads to a
partial radioresistant DNA synthesis phenotype in human cells. In
contrast, concomitant interference with NBS1-MRE11 and the CHK2-CDC25A
(116947)-CDK2 (116953) pathways entirely abolishes inhibition of DNA
synthesis induced by ionizing radiation, resulting in complete
radioresistant DNA synthesis analogous to that caused by defective ATM.
In addition, CDK2-dependent loading of CDC45 (603465) onto replication
origins, a prerequisite for recruitment of DNA polymerase, was prevented
upon irradiation of normal or NBS1/MRE11-defective cells but not cells
with defective ATM. Falck et al. (2002) concluded that in response to
ionizing radiation, phosphorylation of NBS1 and CHK2 by ATM triggers 2
parallel branches of the DNA damage-dependent S-phase checkpoint that
cooperate by inhibiting distinct steps of DNA replication.

In mammalian cells, a conserved multiprotein complex of MRE11, RAD50,
and NBS1 (MRN) is important for double-strand break repair, meiotic
recombination, and telomere maintenance. In the absence of the early
region E4, the double-stranded genome of adenoviruses is joined into
concatemers too large to be packaged. Stracker et al. (2002)
investigated the cellular proteins involved in the concatamer formation
and how they are inactivated by E4 products during a wildtype infection.
They demonstrated that concatamerization requires functional MRE11 and
NBS1, and that these proteins are found at foci adjacent to viral
replication centers. Infection with wildtype virus results in both
reorganization and degradation of members of the MRN complex. These
activities are mediated by 3 viral oncoproteins that prevent
concatamerization. This targeting of cellular proteins involved in the
genomic stability suggested a mechanism for 'hit-and-run' transformation
observed for these viral oncoproteins.

Franchitto and Pichierri (2002) reviewed the roles of RECQL2 (604611)
and RECQL3 (604610) in resolution of a stall in DNA replication, as well
as their possible interaction with the MRN complex.

Tauchi et al. (2002) established an Nbs1 knockout cell line by using the
hyperrecombinogenic chick B-cell line DT40. Exon 4 of the 3 Nbs1 alleles
in DT40 cells was targeted. The Nbs1 -/-/- cells were still viable,
although they exhibited slow growth owing to a prolonged cell cycle
time. The disruption of Nbs1 reduced gene conversion and sister
chromatid exchanges, similar to other homologous recombination-deficient
mutants. In fact, a site-specific double-strand break repair assay
showed a notable reduction of homologous recombination events following
generation of such breaks in Nbs1-disrupted cells. The rare
recombinations observed in the Nbs1-disrupted cells were frequently
found to have aberrant structures, which possibly arose from unusual
crossover events, suggesting that the NBS1 complex might be required to
process recombination intermediates. Thus, Tauchi et al. (2002)
demonstrated that NBS1 is essential for homologous
recombination-mediated repair in higher vertebrate cells.

Zhong et al. (2005) tested whether the MRN complex has a global
controlling role over ATR (601215) through the study of MRN deficiencies
generated by RNA interference. The MRN complex was required for
ATR-dependent phosphorylation of SMC1A (300040), which acts within
chromatin to ensure sister chromatid cohesion and to effect several DNA
damage responses. Novel phenotypes caused by MRN deficiency that support
a functional link between this complex, ATR, and SMC1A, included
hypersensitivity to UV exposure, a defective UV responsive intra-S phase
checkpoint, and a specific pattern of genomic instability. Zhong et al.
(2005) concluded that there is a controlling role for the MRN complex
over the ATR kinase, and that downstream events under this control are
broad, including both chromatin-associated and diffuse signaling
factors.

Yuan et al. (2007) found that NBS1, the regulatory subunit of MRN, was
acetylated, and that its acetylation level was tightly regulated by
SIRT1 (604479). SIRT1 associated with the MRN complex in human cells via
binding to NBS1, and SIRT1 maintained NBS1 in a hypoacetylated state, a
requirement for ionizing radiation-induced phosphorylation of NBS1 on
ser343. Yuan et al. (2007) concluded that deacetylation of NBS1 by SIRT1
plays a key role in regulation of the DNA damage response and
maintenance of genomic stability.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

The human RAD50/MRE11)/NBS1 complex (R/M/N) has a dynamic molecular
architecture consisting of a globular DNA binding domain from which two
50-nanometer coiled coils protrude. The coiled coils are flexible and
their apices can self-associate. The flexibility of the coiled coils
allows their apices to adopt an orientation favorable for interaction.
However, this also allows interaction between the tips of the 2 coiled
coils within the same complex, which competes with and frustrates the
intercomplex interaction required for DNA tethering. Moreno-Herrero et
al. (2005) showed that the dynamic architecture of the R/M/N complex is
markedly affected by DNA binding. DNA binding by the R/M/N globular
domain leads to parallel orientation of the coiled coils; this prevents
intracomplex interactions and favors intercomplex associations needed
for DNA tethering. The R/M/N complex thus is an example of a biologic
nanomachine in which binding to its ligand, in this case DNA, affects
the functional conformation of a domain located 50 nanometers distant.

GENE STRUCTURE

Varon et al. (1998) determined that the NBS1 gene spans more than 50 kb
and contains 16 exons.

MAPPING

Varon et al. (1998) mapped the NBS1 gene to chromosome 8q21. Carney et
al. (1998) mapped the gene to chromosome 8q21.3.

By computer-assisted analysis of 5 BAC clones and an EST sequence,
Tauchi et al. (1999) defined the genomic organization of an 800-kb
region on chromosome 8q21 as 5-prime C8ORF1 (604598), 3-prime NBS1,
5-prime DECR1 (222745), and 3-prime CALB1 (114050).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Varon et al. (1998) identified a truncating 5-bp deletion (602667.0001)
in the NBS1 gene in the majority of NBS patients studied, all of whom
carried a conserved marker haplotype. Five additional truncating
mutations were identified in patients with other distinct haplotypes.
The domains found in nibrin and the NBS phenotype suggest that this
disorder is caused by defective responses to DNA double-strand breaks
(DSB).

Matsuura et al. (1998) detected the 5-bp deletion (602667.0001) in NBS1
in 13 individuals of Slavic or German origin and concluded that it is
likely to be a founder mutation.

The findings that the ataxia-telangiectasia gene is involved in the
pathogenesis of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and other forms of
leukemia, that there is a high predisposition of NBS patients to
lymphoid malignancy, and the fact that NBS and ATM are indistinguishable
at the cellular level, prompted Varon et al. (2001) to investigate
whether the NBS1 gene is involved in the pathogenesis of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and whether it influences the course of the
disease and so has its place among the tumor suppressor genes. They
analyzed samples from 47 children with first relapse of ALL for
mutations in all 16 exons of the NBS1 gene and identified 4 novel amino
acid substitutions in 7 children. Germline origin of an I171V
(602667.0007) mutation was confirmed in 3 patients, whereas another
change, D95N, was present only in leukemic cells. No additional
mutations were found on the second allele in any of these 7 patients.

Tanzarella et al. (2003) found that heterozygous individuals from 3
unrelated NBS families with distinct gene deletion mutations had
spontaneous chromosome instability (chromatid and chromosomal breaks as
well as rearrangements) in blood lymphocytes, but their lymphoblastoid
cell lines were not different from controls in x-ray G2 sensitivity.
Immunoprecipitation of nibrin detected the normal and variant proteins
in carriers from all 3 families.

Nakanishi et al. (2002) reported a patient diagnosed with Fanconi anemia
(FA; 227650) on the basis of chromosome breakage induced by mitomycin C.
The individual showed atypical FA features, including features of NBS.
The clinical syndrome was severe, and the child died at 3 years of age,
similar to an affected cousin. Immunoblot analysis of primary
lymphocytes indicated expression of both unubiquitinated and
monoubiquitinated isoforms of FANCD2 (227646); however, no NBS1 protein
was expressed. Sequence analysis indicated that the patient cells
contained a tyr363-to-ter mutation in NBS1 (602667.0008), which resulted
in a truncated protein. Genomic sequence analysis showed that the
mutation was homozygous. By coimmunoprecipitation, Nakanishi et al.
(2002) found constitutive interaction between FANCD2 and NBS1, and they
presented evidence that these proteins interact in 2 distinct assemblies
to mediate S-phase checkpoint and resistance to mitomycin C-induced
chromosome damage. NBS1, ATM, and MRE11 were required for FANCD2
phosphorylation in response to radiation-induced S-phase checkpoint. The
assembly of NBS1, MRE11, RAD50, and FANCD2 within nuclear foci was
required for mitomycin C resistance.

Plisiecka-Halasa et al. (2002) looked for NBS1 gene alterations and
changes in nibrin expression in 162 human gynecologic tumors, mostly
ovarian. They identified the so-called Slavic mutation, 657del5
(602667.0001), in 2 of 117 carcinomas studied (1.7%). In both cases it
was present in the germline, and in 1 of these tumors there was loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) for the 657del5 mutation and loss of nibrin
expression.

In monozygotic twin brothers with a severe form of NBS, Seemanova et al.
(2006) identified compound heterozygosity for the 657del5 mutation and a
missense mutation (602667.0009) in the NBS1 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhu et al. (2001) generated mice deficient in NBS1 by targeted
disruption. Nbs1 -/- mice suffered early embryonic lethality and had
poorly developed embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Blastocysts
showed greatly diminished expansion of the inner cell mass in culture,
suggesting that NBS1 mediates essential functions during proliferation
in the absence of externally induced damage. Zhu et al. (2001) concluded
that the complex phenotypes observed in NBS patients and cell lines may
not result from a complete inactivation of NBS1 but may instead result
from hypomorphic truncation mutations compatible with cell viability.

Demuth et al. (2004) used the Cre/loxP system to generate mice with an
inducible Nbs1-null mutation, allowing examination of DNA repair and
cell cycle checkpoints in the complete absence of nibrin. Induction of
the null mutation led to loss of the G2/M checkpoint, increased
chromosome damage, radiomimetic sensitivity, and cell death. In vivo,
lymphatic tissues, bone marrow, thymus, and spleen showed a dramatic
decrease in cell survival, whereas liver, kidney, and muscle showed no
effect on cell survival. In vitro, Nbs1-null murine fibroblasts could be
rescued from cell death by transfer of human NBS1 cDNA and, more
significantly, by a cDNA carrying the 5-bp deletion. Demuth et al.
(2004) concluded that the common human 5-bp deletion is hypomorphic and
that expression of a truncated protein may be sufficient to restore
nibrin's vital cellular functions.

Frappart et al. (2005) developed mice with Nbs1 inactivation targeted to
the central nervous system. Nbs1-deleted mice were viable and appeared
normal at birth, but growth retardation was evident by postnatal day 7,
and mutants were half the weight of control mice at weaning. All
Nbs1-deleted mice showed balance disorders, tremors, altered gait,
repetitive movements, and akinesis after postnatal day 7. Macroscopic
examination of brains from mutant mice showed reduced cerebella lacking
foliation. Histologic analysis indicated that Nbs1 loss caused
proliferation arrest of granule cell progenitors and apoptosis of
postmitotic cerebellar neurons. Nbs1-deficient neuroprogenitors showed
proliferation defects in culture, but no increase in apoptosis. They
also contained more chromosomal breaks, which were accompanied by Atm
(607585)-mediated p53 (TP53; 191170) activation. Depletion of p53
substantially rescued the neurologic defects of Nbs1 mutant mice.

Stracker et al. (2007) derived Nbs1 delta-C/delta-C mice in which the
C-terminal ATM interaction domain was deleted. Nbs1 delta-C/delta-C
cells exhibited intra-S-phase checkpoint defects, but were otherwise
indistinguishable from wildtype cells with respect to other checkpoint
functions, ionizing radiation sensitivity, and chromosome stability.
However, multiple tissues of Nbs1 delta-C/delta-C mice showed a severe
apoptotic defect, comparable to that of Atm- or Chk2 (604373)-deficient
animals. Analysis of p53 transcriptional targets and Atm substrates
showed that, in contrast to the phenotype of Chk2 -/- mice, Nbs1-deltaC
does not impair the induction of proapoptotic genes. Stracker et al.
(2007) concluded that instead, the defects observed in Nbs1
delta-C/delta-C mice resulted from impaired phosphorylation at ATM
targets including SMC1 (see 300040) and the proapoptotic factor BID
(601997).

Saidi et al. (2010) found that deletion of Nbs1 in T-cell precursors in
mice resulted in severe lymphopenia and hindered the transition of
double-negative-3 (DN3) thymocytes to DN4 due to abnormal Tcrb (see
186930) coding and signal joints, as well as the functions of Nbs1 in
T-cell expansion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of TCR loci
revealed that Nbs1 depletion compromised the loading of Mre11/Rad50 to
V(D)J-generated DNA DSBs and thereby affected resection of DNA termini
and chromatin conformation of the postcleavage complex. The DN3-to-DN4
transition in the mutant mice, but not T-cell loss, could be relieved by
p53 deficiency. Ectopic Tcra/Tcrb expression also failed to rescue
T-cell lymphopenia in the mutant mice. Saidi et al. (2010) concluded
that NBS1 functions in both repair of V(D)J-generated DSBs and in
proliferation and that both functions are essential for T-cell
development.

NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
OVARIAN CANCER, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
NBN, 5-BP DEL, NT657

In patients of Slavic origin with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (251260),
Varon et al. (1998) identified a common deletion of 5 nucleotides in
exon 6 of the NBS1 gene (657del5), resulting in a frameshift and a
truncated protein. A total of 46 patients homozygous for this mutation
were identified. The mutation was found exclusively on a specific
'Slavic' haplotype of linked polymorphic markers.

Matsuura et al. (1998) found the same 5-bp deletion in the NBS1 gene in
13 NBS patients of Slavic or German origin. Twelve patients were
homozygous for the deletion and 1 was heterozygous. The deletion
introduced a premature termination signal at codon 218, which was
predicted to result in a severely truncated polypeptide. Matsuura et al.
(1998) concluded that they had identified the gene involved in NBS
because complementation was effected by a YAC that contained the gene
and because no (or extremely reduced) expression of the gene was found
in a patient without the deletion but with the NBS phenotype. The
presence of a founder mutation in 13 of 14 cases, with no demonstration
of the deletion in 50 normal individuals of the same ethnic origin or in
7 normal chromosomes from NBS parents, supported this conclusion.

The truncating 657del5 had been identified in 90% of NBS patients. NBS
shares a number of features with ataxia-telangiectasia (208900), the
most notable being high sensitivity to ionizing radiation and
predisposition to cancer. Patients who are heterozygous for the ATM
mutation are predisposed to breast cancer. Since the NBS phenotype at
the cellular level is very similar to that of ataxia-telangiectasia,
Carlomagno et al. (1999) screened 477 German breast cancer patients,
aged under 51 years, and 866 matched controls for the common NBS
mutation. They identified 1 carrier among the cases and 1 among the
controls, indicating that the population frequency of this NBS mutation
is 1 in 866 persons (95% CI = 1 in 34,376 to 1 in 156) and the estimated
prevalence of NBS is thus 1 in 3 million persons. The proportion of
breast cancer attributable to this mutation is less than 1%.

Kleier et al. (2000) reported a 5-year-old Bosnian boy with severe
microcephaly. Because of multiple structural aberrations involving
chromosomes 7 and 14 typical for ataxia-telangiectasia, that disorder
was diagnosed. However, the diagnosis of NBS was suggested by the boy's
remarkable microcephaly, his facial appearance, and the absence of
ataxia and telangiectasia. DNA analysis demonstrated homozygosity for
the major mutation in the NBS1 gene, 657del5.

Maser et al. (2001) tested the hypothesis that the NBS1 657del5 mutation
was a hypomorphic defect. They showed that NBS cells harboring the
657del5 mutation contained a predicted 26-kD N-terminal protein,
NBS1(p26), and a 70-kD NBS1 protein, NBS1(p70), lacking the native N
terminus. The 26-kD protein is not physically associated with the MRE11
complex (600814), whereas the 70-kD species is physically associated
with it. NBS1(p70) is produced by internal translation initiation within
the NBS mRNA using an open reading frame generated by the 657del5
frameshift. Maser et al. (2001) proposed that the common NBS1 allele
encodes a partially functional protein that diminishes the severity of
the NBS phenotype.

Tekin et al. (2002) reported a consanguineous Turkish family whose first
son died of anal atresia and whose second son, the proband, presented
with severe pre- and postnatal growth retardation as well as striking
microcephaly, immunodeficiency, congenital heart disease, chromosomal
instability, and rhabdomyosarcoma in the anal region. The patient was
homozygous for the 657del5 mutation in the NBS1 gene, which is
responsible for NBS in most Slav populations. The family was the first
diagnosed with NBS in the Turkish population and was one of the most
severely affected examples of the syndrome.

Drabek et al. (2002) presented PCR with sequence specific primers as a
method for detection of the 657del5 mutation. They confirmed a high
carrier frequency in the Czech population (1 in 106 persons; 95% CI = 1
in 331 to 1 in 46).

In Russian children, Resnick et al. (2003) screened for the 657del5 NBS1
mutation in 548 controls and 68 patients with lymphoid malignancies. No
carrier of the mutation was found in the control group. The mutation was
found in heterozygous form in 2 of the 68 patients from the group of
lymphoid malignancies, 1 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (see 159555)
and 1 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (605027). Several relatives of the
patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who carried the same mutation had
cancer (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, breast cancer, gastrointestinal
cancers), suggesting that heterozygosity may predispose to malignant
disorders.

In monozygotic twin brothers with a severe form of NBS (251260) without
chromosomal instability, Seemanova et al. (2006) identified compound
heterozygosity for the 657del5 mutation and a 643C-T transition in exon
6 of the NBS1 gene, resulting in an arg215-to-trp (R215W) substitution
(602667.0009). Both infants showed reduced expression of full-length
nibrin, and radiation response processes were strongly reduced in their
cells. Their mother and father were heterozygous for the 657del5
mutation and the R215W mutation, respectively, as were their respective
grandfathers.

In a 3-month-old boy with NBS, Varon et al. (2007) identified
homozygosity for the 657del5 mutation; the patient's mother carried the
mutation, whereas his father was homozygous for the wildtype allele.
Analysis of 27 microsatellite markers covering all of chromosome 8
revealed that the patient had a homozygous haplotype for all of the
markers, whereas the mother carried the same haplotype in heterozygous
state. The authors stated that this was the first patient with NBS due
to maternal isodisomy of chromosome 8.

Porhanova et al. (2008) reported a 52-year-old Russian woman with
ovarian cancer (see 604370) who was found to be compound heterozygous
for a mutation in the BRCA1 gene (113705.0018) and the common Slavic
657del5 mutation in the NBN gene. Investigation of the ovarian cancer
tissue showed somatic loss of heterozygosity for NBN, but retention of
heterozygosity for BRCA1. The patient did not have a particularly severe
cancer-prone phenotype, and her parents did not have cancer, although 3
sibs developed cancer as adults. Porhanova et al. (2008) commented that
haploinsufficiency of the BRCA1 gene may contribute to cancer
progression without somatic changes.

NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, 4-BP DEL, NT698

In a patient of English origin with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (251260),
Varon et al. (1998) identified a deletion of 4 nucleotides in exon 6 of
the NBS1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein.

.0003
NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, 4-BP DEL, NT835

In a patient of Italian origin with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (251260),
Varon et al. (1998) identified a deletion of 4 nucleotides in exon 7 of
the NBS1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein.

.0004
NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, 1-BP INS

In a patient of Mexican origin with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (251260),
Varon et al. (1998) identified an insertion of 1 nucleotide in exon 7 of
the NBS1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein.

.0005
NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, 1-BP DEL, 1142C

In a patient of Canadian origin with Nijmegen breakage syndrome
(251260), Varon et al. (1998) identified a deletion of 1 nucleotide in
exon 10 of the NBS1 gene, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated
protein.

.0006
NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, GLN326TER

In a patient of Dutch origin with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (251260),
Varon et al. (1998) identified a nonsense mutation, gln326 to ter, in
exon 10 of the NBS1 gene, resulting in a truncated protein.

APLASTIC ANEMIA
LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA, ACUTE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, INCLUDED
NBN, ILE171VAL

In 3 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Varon et al. (2001)
found germline heterozygosity for an A-to-G change at nucleotide 511,
resulting in an ile171-to-val (I171V) mutation occurring in a domain of
nibrin that is probably involved in protein-protein interactions.

In an 11-year-old Japanese girl with aplastic anemia (609135) and no
features of Nijmegen breakage syndrome (251260), Shimada et al. (2004)
identified homozygosity for the I171V mutation in the NBS1 gene. Genetic
analysis of the patient and her healthy parents indicated that she
inherited the germline I171V mutation from her father and the wildtype
allele from her mother, and that the second I171V hit occurred on the
wildtype allele early in embryonic development. Cytogenetic analysis of
lymphoblastic cell lines from the patient showed a marked increase in
numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations in the absence of
clastogens, suggesting genomic instability. Shimada et al. (2004) also
screened 413 normal controls and found heterozygosity for I171V in 5
individuals, corresponding to 1.2% of the Japanese population.

.0008
NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, TYR363TER

Nakanishi et al. (2002) reported a patient diagnosed with Fanconi anemia
(FA; 227650) on the basis of chromosome breakage induced by mitomycin C.
The individual showed atypical FA features, including features of NBS
(251260). The clinical syndrome was severe, and the child died at 3
years of age, similar to an affected cousin. In this patient, Nakanishi
et al. (2002) identified a homozygous C-to-A mutation at nucleotide 1089
of the NBS1 gene, resulting in a tyr363-to-ter mutation and a truncated
protein.

.0010
NIJMEGEN BREAKAGE SYNDROME
NBN, 2-BP INS, 742GG

In a 53-year-old woman with a mild form of Nijmegen breakage syndrome
(251260) originally reported by Maraschio et al. (1986), Varon et al.
(2006) identified a homozygous 2-bp insertion (742insGG) in exon 7 of
the NBN gene, predicted to result in premature termination. RT-PCR
analysis identified 2 transcripts in both the patient and her parents:
the expected transcript carrying the 2-bp insertion and a second
transcript with in-frame deletion of exons 6 and 7. The skipping of
exons 6 and 7 results in a 650-amino acid protein with a molecular mass
of 73 kD; it also eliminates the 742insGG mutation in exon 7. The 73-kD
(del6-del7) transcript was observed at levels 100-fold lower in controls
than in the patient and her parents, and the del6-del7 transcript was
detected as minor product in RNA from patients with the 657del5 mutation
(602667.0001). The open reading frame of the del6-del7 transcript
predicts a partially functional protein, which was confirmed by studies
in mouse cells. ESE prediction analysis suggested that 742insGG may
affect an ESE sequence, possibly resulting in decreased splicing
enhancer activity. Because the NBN transcript can only remain in-frame
if both exons 6 and 7 are deleted, the authors hypothesized that the
presence of the del6-del7 transcript results from an active mechanism in
which reestablishment of the reading frame requires elimination of the 2
exons. The patient had no immunodeficiency and had not had frequent
infections. Varon et al. (2006) concluded that the unusually mild
phenotype in this patient resulted from residual nibrin activity.

604776	TITLE *604776 MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX, CLASS II, DR BETA-5; HLA-DRB5
DESCRIPTION Three subregions of the human major histocompatibility (HLA) complex on
6p21.3, DP, DQ, and DR, determine class II molecules, which are
essential in the cellular recognition interactions involved in the
generation of an immune response. Several class II antigens are also
associated with disease states. The extremely high polymorphism of HLA
class II transmembrane heterodimers is due to a few hypervariable
segments present in the most external domain of their alpha and beta
chains. The alpha chain of HLA-DR is not polymorphic, whereas the beta
chain is highly so. Some changes in amino acid sequence are critical in
disease susceptibility associations as well as the ability to present
processed antigens to T cells. By screening an HLA-DR5-homozygous cell
line cDNA library with a HLA-DRB1 (142857) probe, Tieber et al. (1986)
obtained an HLA-DRB5 cDNA encoding a 266-amino acid protein, of which
the first 29 amino acids constitute a signal peptide. Sequence
comparisons with other HLA-DRB sequences revealed regions of variability
at amino acid positions 9-13, 26-38, and 67-74 in the mature protein,
all of which are in the first external domain. The average amino acid
sequence difference between HLA-DRB5 and HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB2, and
HLA-DRB4 is 13.5%.

Lang et al. (2002) examined the association of multiple sclerosis (MS;
126200) with HLA-DRB1*1501 and -DRB5*0101 polymorphisms by determining
the antigen-recognition profile of an MS patient with a
relapsing-remitting disease course. A T-cell receptor (TCR) from the
patient recognized both DRB1*1501-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP;
159430) (residues 85 to 99) and DRB5*0101-restricted Epstein-Barr virus
DNA polymerase peptide. The crystal structure of both DRB-antigen
complexes revealed a marked degree of structural equivalence at the
surface presented for TCR recognition, with 4 identical TCR-peptide
contacts. Lang et al. (2002) concluded that these similarities support
the concept of molecular mimicry (in structural terms, a similarity of
charge distribution) involving HLA molecules and suggested that these
structural details may explain the preponderance of MHC class II
associations in HLA-associated diseases. They noted the findings of
Madsen et al. (1999) with transgenic mice, which also showed that MBP(85
to 99) associated with HLA-DRB1*1501 was involved in the development of
an MS-like disease.

611191	TITLE *611191 MICRO RNA 125A; MIR125A
;;MIRN125A;;
miRNA125A
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), such as MIRN125A, are small noncoding RNAs that
control translation of target mRNAs by binding to sites of antisense
complementarity in 3-prime UTRs (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002).

CLONING

Lagos-Quintana et al. (2002) cloned mouse miRNA125a. Mouse miRNA125a and
miRNA125b (see 610105) differ only by a central diuridine insertion and
a U-to-C change in miRNA125a. Both miRNAs are similar to the C. elegans
lin-4 small temporal RNA. Northern blot analysis detected miRNA125a
expression in all mouse brain regions examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Laneve et al. (2007) found that MIRN9 (see 611186), MIRN125A, and
MIRN125B were upregulated in a human neuroblastoma cell line by retinoic
acid. They identified the mRNA encoding t-NTRK3, a truncated isoform of
NTRK3 (191316), as a target of the 3 miRNAs. The 3-prime UTR of the
t-NTRK3 transcript has a binding site for MIRN9 and another for both
MIRN125A and MIRN125B, which share the same seed sequence. These miRNAs
repressed t-NTRK3 expression in an additive manner, and downregulation
of t-NTRK3 was critical for regulating neuroblastoma cell growth.
Consistent with their function, MIRN9, MIRN125A, and MIRN125B were
downmodulated in primary neuroblastoma tumors.

MAPPING

Duan et al. (2007) stated that the MIR125A gene maps to chromosome
19q13.41.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By searching a human SNP database, Duan et al. (2007) identified a
G-to-U SNP at nucleotide +8 (+8G-U) in the mature MIR125A sequence.
Northern blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses of transfected HEK293
cells detected the mature form of the major +8G allele of MIR125A, but
not the mature form of the minor +8U allele. The +8G-U SNP was predicted
to introduce a base-pairing mismatch, alter free energy values, and
create an enlarged RNA bulge in pri-MIR125A. In vivo analysis showed
that +8G-U blocked processing of pri-MIR125A to pre-MIR125A. Expression
of a vector containing MIR125A +8G, but not MIR125A +8U, could suppress
a MIR125A target reporter, LIN28 (611043). Duan et al. (2007) concluded
that the +8G-U SNP alters MIR125A processing and reduces
MIR125A-mediated translational suppression.

238310	TITLE *238310 AMINOMETHYLTRANSFERASE; AMT
;;GLYCINE CLEAVAGE SYSTEM T PROTEIN; GCST
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The enzyme system for cleavage of glycine (glycine cleavage system; EC
2.1.2.10), which is confined to the mitochondria, is composed of 4
protein components: P protein (a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent glycine
decarboxylase; GLDC, 238300), H protein (a lipoic acid-containing
protein; GCSH, 238330), T protein (a tetrahydrofolate-requiring enzyme),
and L protein (a lipoamide dehydrogenase; DLD, 238331).

Mutations in the T, P, and H proteins have been found to cause glycine
encephalopathy (GCE; 605899).

CLONING

The T protein of the glycine cleavage system is also known as
aminomethyltransferase (AMT). Nanao et al. (1994) isolated the AMT gene
from a human placenta cosmid library. They found that the gene is about
6 kb long and contains 9 exons. They identified 2 putative
glucocorticoid-responsive elements and a putative thyroid
hormone-responsive element. By dot-blot analysis, Kure et al. (2001)
detected expression of AMT in all tissues tested except stomach and bone
marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Sakata et al. (2001) reported the structure and expression of the
glycine cleavage system in rat central nervous system.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ hybridization, Nanao et al. (1994) assigned the
AMT gene to 3p21.2-p21.1.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with glycine encephalopathy, Nanao et al. (1994) identified
mutations in the AMT gene (238310.0001-238310.0002).

Toone et al. (2000) studied 14 unrelated patients with glycine
encephalopathy and identified mutations in 4 cases. In 2 patients,
mutations were identified in the T protein: 1 patient was homozygous for
an arg320-to-his mutation (R320H; 238310.0006), and the other patient
was heterozygous for a novel glutamine-to-termination substitution at
codon 192 (238310.0007).

Applegarth and Toone (2001) reviewed the laboratory diagnosis of glycine
encephalopathy and confirmed 9 mutations in the T protein and 8
mutations in the P protein. They also reviewed the 7 cases of transient
NKH known at that time.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY269ASP

Nanao et al. (1994) found that a patient with typical glycine
encephalopathy (605899) was homozygous for a missense mutation in the
AMT gene, a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-asp substitution at
amino acid 269 (G269D).

.0002
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLY47ARG

In 2 sisters with atypical glycine encephalopathy (605899), Nanao et al.
(1994) found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the T
protein gene: a G-to-A transition leading to a gly-to-arg substitution
at amino acid 47 (G47R) in 1 allele, and a G-to-A transition leading to
an arg-to-his substitution at amino acid 320 (R320H; 238310.0006) in the
other allele. Nanao et al. (1994) pointed out that gly269, which was
mutant in the typically severe case they studied (see 238300.0001), is
conserved in T proteins of various species, even in E. coli, whereas
gly47 and arg320, which were mutant in the atypical and milder cases,
are replaced by ala and leu, respectively, in E. coli. Thus, mutation
occurring in more conservative amino acid residues results in more
deleterious damage to the T protein and a more severe clinical
phenotype.

.0003
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, HIS42ARG

Kure et al. (1998) reported a large Israeli-Arab kindred with glycine
encephalopathy (605899). Enzymatic analysis demonstrated that T-protein
activity was deficient in the liver from 1 affected person in the
family. Mutation detection revealed a missense mutation in exon 2
resulting in an amino acid substitution from histidine to arginine at
position 42 (his42 to arg). Homozygosity for the H42R mutation was seen
in all affected members of the family.

.0004
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, 1-BP DEL, 183C

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899), Kure et al.
(1998) described a 1-bp deletion (183delC) and a missense mutation,
asp276 to his (238310.0005).

.0005
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ASP276HIS

In a Japanese patient with glycine encephalopathy (605899) of neonatal
onset, Kure et al. (1998) found a G-to-C substitution at position 955 in
exon 7, resulting in an amino acid change from aspartate to histidine at
position 276.

.0006
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, ARG320HIS

See 238310.0001 and Nanao et al. (1994).

Toone et al. (2001) screened a DNA bank from 50 patients with
enzymatically confirmed NKH and identified the arg320-to-his (R320H)
mutation in 7% of alleles.

.0007
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, GLN192TER

In a patient with neonatal-onset NKH (605899), Toone et al. (2000)
identified a C-to-T transition resulting in a glutamine-to-termination
codon substitution at residue 192 (Q192X). The other mutation in this
patient was not identified.

.0008
GLYCINE ENCEPHALOPATHY
AMT, IVS7, G-A, -1

Toone et al. (2001) reported a novel splice site mutation at the -1
position of intron 7 of the AMT gene: G was converted to A. This
mutation was found in 3 unrelated families and was not found in any
normal controls.

138760	TITLE *138760 HYDROXYACYL GLUTATHIONE HYDROLASE; HAGH
;;GLYOXALASE II; GLO2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6), otherwise known as hydroxyacyl-glutathione
hydrolase, converts the intermediate substrate S-lactoyl-glutathione to
reduced glutathione and D-lactate (summary by Honey and Shows, 1981).

CLONING

Ridderstrom et al. (1996) cloned a cDNA coding for glyoxalase II from
human liver. The 1,011-bp sequence contains a full-length coding region
of 780 basepairs, corresponding to a 260-amino acid polypeptide. The
calculated molecular mass of the protein is 28,861 Da. They expressed
the gene in bacteria and the recombinant enzyme showed a kinetic
behavior indistinguishable from that of the native enzyme.

MAPPING

By study of somatic cell hybrids, Honey and Shows (1981) concluded that
the gene for glyoxalase II is on chromosome 16. Mulley and Callen (1986)
confirmed the assignment of HAGH to chromosome 16 by studies of a
human-mouse hybrid panel. They found that both HAGH and phosphoglycolate
phosphatase (PGP; 172280) were present only in those cell lines
containing 16p13.

Mulley et al. (1990) assigned the HAGH locus to 16p13.3 by
electrophoretic detection of enzymes from a mouse/human somatic cell
panel, the members of which carried portions of human chromosome 16 with
precisely defined breakpoints.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Board (1980) described rare polymorphism of glyoxalase II, observed only
in a Micronesian population, in which a new variant allele had a
frequency of 0.016. In the heterozygotes, the electrophoretic pattern
was a double band, suggesting that the structure of glyoxalase II is
monomeric. The enzyme shows a high degree of polymorphism in anthropoid
primates (Board et al., 1981).

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

602123	TITLE *602123 CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE II-GAMMA; CAMK2G
;;CaM KINASE II GAMMA SUBUNIT;;
CAMKG
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is a
ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated in
diverse effects of hormones and neurotransmitters that utilize Ca(2+) as
a second messenger. The enzyme is an oligomeric protein composed of
distinct but related subunits, alpha (114078), beta (607707), gamma, and
delta (607708), each encoded by a separate gene. Each subunit has
alternatively spliced variants.

CLONING

Breen and Ashcroft (1997) cloned and sequenced a novel CaM kinase
II-gamma cDNA from human islet cell RNA. This isoform, designated
gamma-SRP by the authors, encodes a truncated gamma CaM kinase II in
which the 3-prime end consists of 804 basepairs of the human SRP72 gene
(602122).

Tombes and Krystal (1997) identified a number of CAMKG variants
expressed by neuronal cells. Two variants were consistently expressed in
nonneuronal cell lines, and another was preferentially expressed in
tumor cells.

MAPPING

Using somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Li et al. (1994) mapped the CAMK2G gene to human
chromosome 10q22. Ahmed et al. (2001) stated that CAMK2G is 1 of 3 genes
that are nested in the introns of PCDH15 (605514).

GENE FUNCTION

In mouse cardiomyocytes, Zhu et al. (2003) demonstrated that
beta-1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1; 109630)-induced apoptosis was
resistant to inhibition of PKA (see 176911). Rather, the Adrb1
proapoptotic effect was associated with non-Pka-dependent increases in
intracellular Ca(2+) and Camk2 activity. Blocking the L-type Ca(2+)
channel (see 114205), buffering intracellular Ca(2+), or inhibiting
Camk2 activity fully protected cardiomyocytes against Adrb1-induced
apoptosis; overexpressing the c splice variant of Camk2d markedly
exaggerated the Adrb1 apoptotic effect. Zhu et al. (2003) concluded that
CAMK2 constitutes a PKA-independent linkage of ADRB1 stimulation to
cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

Among 304 Swiss individuals tested and genotyped, de Quervain and
Papassotiropoulos (2006) found a significant association (p = 0.00008)
between short-term episodic memory performance and genetic variations in
a 7-gene cluster consisting of the ADCY8 (103070), PRKACG (176893),
CAMK2G, GRIN2A (138253), GRIN2B (138252), GRM3 (601115), and PRKCA
(176960) genes, all of which have well-established molecular and
biologic functions in animal memory. Functional MRI studies in an
independent set of 32 individuals with similar memory performance showed
a correlation between activation in memory-related brain regions,
including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and genetic
variability in the 7-gene cluster. De Quervain and Papassotiropoulos
(2006) concluded that these 7 genes encode proteins of the memory
formation signaling cascade that are important for human memory
function.

To study the role of CaMKII in T cells, Bui et al. (2000) generated
transgenic mice expressing a partially calcium-independent mutant form
of CAMKG (thr287 to asp). The size of the thymus was increased 1.5- to
2-fold in these mice, at least in part due to an increase in the life
span of double-positive thymocytes. There was an increase in the number
of T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs that had acquired an
antigen-dependent memory phenotype. These T cells were bona fide memory
cells as assessed by a variety of criteria. In addition, T cells from
wildtype mice acquired calcium-independent CaMKII activity after several
rounds of antigen-stimulated division. The authors proposed that CaMKII
controls a distinct process of activation-induced cellular
differentiation.

Using gene targeting, Zhang et al. (2005) developed a mouse model of
cardiac Camk2 inhibition and demonstrated substantial prevention of
maladaptive remodeling from excessive beta-adrenergic receptor
stimulation and myocardial infarction, and induction of balanced changes
in excitation-contraction coupling that preserved baseline and
beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated physiologic increases in cardiac
function. Zhang et al. (2005) concluded that CAMK2 is a determinant of
clinically important heart disease phenotypes.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
VARIANT OF UNKNOWN SIGNIFICANCE
CAMK2G, ARG292PRO

This variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance because
its contribution to intellectual disability has not been confirmed.

In a boy with severe intellectual disability with self mutilation,
myopia, strabismus, mitochondrial dysfunction without mitochondrial gene
defects, short stature, flat face with narrow forehead, long palpebral
fissures, arched eyebrows, sacral dimple, short hands, brachydactyly,
and short feet, de Ligt et al. (2012) identified a de novo heterozygous
875G-C transversion resulting in an arg29-to-pro (R29P) substitution.
The patient had normal array and MLL2 testing.

;;SLAP130;;

ADHESION AND DEGRANULATION ADAPTOR PROTEIN; ADAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

T-cell receptor signaling involves activation of the src
protein-tyrosine kinases LCK (153390) and FYN (137025), leading to the
phosphorylation of various substrates including SLP76 (LCP2; 601603). Da
Silva et al. (1993) identified FYB (called p120/130 by them), a 120- and
130-kD protein doublet that associates with the SH2 domain of FYN.
T-cell receptor ligation led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
FYB. Da Silva et al. (1997) showed that the 120- and 130-kD doublet is
composed of 2 related isoforms of FYB. In T cells from FYN mutant mice,
the phosphorylation of FYB was reduced, but not abolished, suggesting to
da Silva et al. (1997) that FYB could be phosphorylated by another
kinase. By screening a Jurkat T-cell line expression library with
antibodies against FYB, da Silva et al. (1997) identified FYB cDNAs.
Northern blot analysis revealed that the 4.5-kb FYB mRNA is expressed
only in myeloid and T cells. Expression of FYB in mammalian cells
yielded a protein that migrated at 120 kD on SDS-PAGE. By Western
blotting, da Silva et al. (1997B) showed that FYB coimmunoprecipitated
with FYN and with SLP76 in mammalian cell lysates. They concluded that
FYB acts as a component of the FYN and SLP76 signaling cascades in T
cells.

Musci et al. (1997) cloned cDNAs encoding SLAP130, a 130-kD
phosphoprotein that is associated with SLP76. Da Silva et al. (1997)
stated that SLAP130 is identical to FYB except for 2 conservative and 1
nonconservative amino acid substitutions. Musci et al. (1997) attributed
the difference between the calculated mass of SLAP130 (86 kD) and the
observed mass by SDS-PAGE (130 kD) to posttranslational modifications or
the abundance of charged amino acids.

Da Silva et al. (1997) used the human FYB cDNA to clone the mouse
homolog. The sequence of the predicted 783-amino acid human FYB protein
shares 77% identity with that of mouse FYB.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoblot analysis, Geng et al. (2001) showed that FCER1A (147140)
aggregation induces rapid FYB tyrosine phosphorylation in rat basophilic
leukemia mast cells and the release of beta hexosaminidase (see 606873).
Confocal microscopy demonstrated that FYB colocalizes with actin (see
ACTA1; 102610) in membrane ruffles. FYB overexpression enhanced mast
cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN1; 135600) and SH3 domain-mediated
release of beta hexosaminidase, implying increased histamine release as
well. Mast cell adhesion had no effect on FYB phosphorylation but
enhanced beta hexosaminidase release.

Medeiros et al. (2007) presented evidence for a previously unrecognized
function for ADAP in regulating T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated
activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011).
Stimulation of ADAP-deficient mouse T cells with antibodies to CD3 (see
186740) and CD28 (186760) resulted in impaired nuclear translocation of
NF-kappa-B, a reduced DNA binding, and delayed degradation and decreased
phosphorylation of I-kappa-B (see 164008). TCR-stimulated assembly of
the CARMA1 (607210)-BCL10 (603517)-MALT1 (604860) complex was
substantially impaired in the absence of ADAP. Medeiros et al. (2007)
further identified a region of ADAP that is required for association
with the CARMA1 adaptor and NF-kappa-B activation but is not required
for ADAP-dependent regulation of adhesion.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using gene targeting strategies, Griffiths et al. (2001) and Peterson et
al. (2001) each generated mice lacking Fyb expression in mature T
lymphocytes. Although lymphocyte development was normal in these mice,
splenic CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
numbers were reduced, suggesting that Fyb may be required for peripheral
T-cell homeostasis. T-cell proliferation in response to phorbol ester
was normal in Fyb-deficient cells, but responses to anti-CD3E (186830),
with or without anti-CD28 (186760), were reduced, as were cytokine
production and activation marker upregulation. These results
demonstrated that Fyb acts as a positive regulator of T-cell activation.
Fyb-deficient mice also had reduced antibody production to T-dependent
antigens in vivo. Although downstream signaling pathways and antigen
receptor clustering were normal, clustering of the integrin LFA1 (see
153370 and 600065) was not. Flow chamber analysis demonstrated that
anti-CD3E-stimulated but not phorbol ester-stimulated Fyb-deficient T
cells were defective in adhering to mouse Icam1 (147840), to human ICAM2
(146630), and to other substrates mediated by integrins, although
integrin expression was not reduced. Using confocal microscopy, Peterson
et al. (2001) showed that Fyb-deficient T cells had normal clustering of
actin but no polarization of LFA1, whereas LFA1 clustering was markedly
increased in wildtype T cells. Griffiths et al. (2001) concluded that
the T-cell receptor-induced adhesion defect in integrin activation was
due to a block in 'inside-out' signaling between the T-cell receptor and
integrins. Peterson et al. (2001) and Griffiths et al. (2001) proposed
that on the basis of these findings and studies by Geng et al. (2001),
which implicated FYB in vasoactive mediator release, that FYB be
redesignated 'adhesion and degranulation adaptor protein,' or ADAP.
