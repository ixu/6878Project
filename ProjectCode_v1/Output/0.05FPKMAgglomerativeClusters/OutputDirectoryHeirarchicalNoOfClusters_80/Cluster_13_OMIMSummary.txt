CLONING

Kao et al. (1994) cloned cDNAs encoding NF45 and NF90. The NF90 gene
encodes a 671-amino acid polypeptide with limited similarity to several
RNA-binding proteins. The NF90 gene also appears to encode an
alternatively spliced 404-amino acid polypeptide, of which the first 394
amino acids are identical to the longer clone. Northern and Western blot
analysis demonstrated NF45 and NF90 expression in several cell types,
including both unstimulated and stimulated Jurkat T cells.

By immunoscreening a HeLa cell cDNA library for phosphoproteins,
Matsumoto-Taniura et al. (1996) isolated a partial cDNA encoding ILF3,
which they termed MPP4. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that MPP4
encodes 90- and 110-kD proteins. Immunofluorescence microscopy
demonstrated cytoplasmic expression during M phase and nuclear/nucleolar
expression during interphase.

Patel et al. (1999) purified double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding
proteins from HeLa cell extracts and microsequenced a 90-kD protein with
identity to MPP4 in its N terminus. Using a yeast 2-hybrid screen with a
mutant RNA-activated protein kinase (PRKR; 176871) as bait, followed by
RT-PCR, they isolated a full-length cDNA encoding ILF3, which they
called DRBP76. Sequence analysis predicted that the 702-amino acid
protein has a bipartite nuclear localization signal, 2 dsRNA-binding
domains, an RG2 domain, and multiple potential phosphorylation sites.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed expression of a 90-kD protein, larger than the
calculated 76 kD. EMSA analysis confirmed the dsRNA binding activity of
DRBP76. Autoradiographic analysis indicated that DRBP76 is
phosphorylated by PRKR.

Langland et al. (1999) noted that NF90 is primarily localized to
ribosomes.

Saunders et al. (2001) obtained a cDNA encoding DRBP76, which they
termed NFAR1, as well as a variant cDNA encoding a 110-kD, 894-amino
acid protein they designated NFAR2. Sequence analysis showed that the
NFAR proteins share homology with a known PRKR substrate, the
translation initiation factor EIF2S1 (603907). Northern blot analysis
revealed ubiquitous expression of multiple transcripts ranging from 4.0
to 8.0 kb. Immunoblot analysis indicated variable expression with lower
amounts particularly notable in liver and spleen, suggesting
differential regulation at the translational or posttranslational level.
Immunoblot analysis and confocal microscopy demonstrated that PRKR and
both NFAR variants reciprocally coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize in
the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated an association with
spliceosomes.

Viranaicken et al. (2006) identified splice variants of human and mouse
ILF3 that encode long and short isoforms of the ILF3 and NF90 proteins
via inclusion or exclusion of 13 N-terminal residues, respectively.

GENE FUNCTION

Kao et al. (1994) showed that the NF45 and NF90 proteins form an NFAT
DNA-binding activity that is enhanced by T-cell stimulation and
inhibited by cyclosporin A and FK506.

Functional analysis by Saunders et al. (2001) indicated that both NFAR
proteins regulate gene transcription, probably at the level of mRNA
elongation. NFAR2 exhibited potent, constitutive regulatory activity
through its unique C-terminal region, which specifically interacted with
FUS (137070) and SMN1 (600354). Saunders et al. (2001) concluded that
NFARs facilitate dsRNA-regulated gene expression at the level of
posttranscription.

Shim et al. (2002) showed that NF90 binds to a subregion of the 3-prime
untranslated region that contains several AU-rich elements (AREs) and
slows down the degradation of IL2 (147680) mRNA. In nonstimulated cells,
NF90 was mostly nuclear, but T-cell activation resulted in its
accumulation in the cytoplasm. The authors concluded that nuclear export
of NF90 is required for IL2 mRNA stabilization.

Pfeifer et al. (2008) found that NFAR1 and NFAR2 were involved in
retaining cellular transcripts in intranuclear foci and could regulate
mRNA export to the cytoplasm. They also remained associated with
exported ribonucleoprotein complexes. Treatment of HeLa cells with small
interfering RNA to NFAR1 and/or NFAR2 resulted in an increase in protein
synthesis rates, particularly in the presence the mRNA export factors
TAP (NXF1; 602647), p15 (NXT1; 605811), or RAE1 (603343). Depletion of
NFAR in mouse fibroblasts or HeLa cells dramatically increased their
susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis virus or influenza virus,
respectively. Pfeifer et al. (2008) concluded that NFAR1 and NFAR2 are
retained on polyribosomes and act to govern translation rates, and that
they also play a role in innate immune defense to virus infection.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Saunders et al. (2001) determined that the
NFAR gene contains 21 exons and spans 16.2 kb. The 90-kD NFAR1 variant
expresses exon 18, which contains several stop codons that lead to
termination at amino acid 702. The 110-kD NFAR2 variant lacks exon 18
but contains exons 19, 20, and 21.

Viranaicken et al. (2006) identified an additional alternatively spliced
exon within intron 2 of the mouse and human ILF3 genes, increasing the
total number of exons to 22.

MAPPING

Saunders et al. (2001) mapped the NFAR gene to chromosome 19p13 by FISH.

ANIMAL MODEL

Pfeifer et al. (2008) found that mice lacking Nfar died in utero.

102600	TITLE *102600 ADENINE PHOSPHORIBOSYLTRANSFERASE; APRT
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The APRT gene encodes adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7), an
enzyme that catalyzes the formation of AMP from adenine and
phosphoribosylpyrophosphate. APRT acts as a salvage enzyme for the
recycling of adenine into nucleic acids (summary by Broderick et al.,
1987).

CLONING

Wilson et al. (1986) determined the amino acid sequence of the APRT
protein. The enzyme has 179 residues with a calculated molecular weight
of 19.5 kD.

Broderick et al. (1987) determined the nucleotide sequence of the human
APRT gene. The APRT gene encodes a 180-amino acid protein (Tischfield
and Ruddle, 1974). Comparative analysis by Broderick et al. (1987)
showed that the amino acid sequence is highly conserved: the human
protein was 82% and 90% identical to the mouse and hamster sequences,
respectively. The gene is constitutively expressed and subject to
little, if any, regulation.

Hidaka et al. (1987) prepared a complete sequence of the APRT gene and
found a number of discrepancies from the sequence reported by Broderick
et al. (1987), all occurring within noncoding regions.

GENE STRUCTURE

Broderick et al. (1987) determined that the APRT gene is about 2.6 kb
long and contains 5 exons. The promoter region of the human APRT gene,
like that of several other housekeeping genes, lacks the 'TATA' and
'CCAAT' boxes but contains 5 GC boxes that are potential binding sites
for the Sp1 transcription factor. Broderick et al. (1987) found that CpG
dinucleotides in the APRT gene in species as widely separated in
evolution as man, mouse, hamster, and E. coli were conserved at a
frequency higher than expected on the basis of randomness considering
the G+C content of the gene. This suggested some importance of this
sequence to the function of the gene. Although the intron 1 sequences of
mouse and man had no apparent homology, both had retained a very high
CpG content.

MAPPING

By cell hybridization studies, Tischfield and Ruddle (1974) concluded
that the APRT locus is on chromosome 16. Marimo and Giannelli (1975)
confirmed this assignment by demonstrating a 1.69-fold increase in
enzyme level in trisomy 16 cells. The same cells showed no difference in
the levels of HGPRT (308000), G6PD (305900) or adenosine kinase (102750)
from controls.

Barg et al. (1982) assigned APRT to chromosome 16pter-q12. Lavinha et
al. (1984) assigned APRT and DIA4 (125860) to 16q12-q22 by study of
rearranged chromosomes 16 in somatic cell hybrids. For APRT,
Ferguson-Smith and Cox (1984) found a smallest region of overlap (SRO)
of 16q22.2-q22.3.

Fratini et al. (1986) mapped the APRT locus with respect to the HP
(140100) locus and the fragile site at 16q23.2 (FRA16D). A subclone of
the APRT gene and a cDNA clone of HP were used for molecular
hybridization to DNA from mouse-human hybrid cell lines containing
specific chromosome 16 translocations. The APRT subclone was used for in
situ hybridization to chromosomes expressing FRA16D. APRT was found to
be distal to HP and FRA16D and was localized at 16q24, making the gene
order cen--FRA16B--HP--FRA16D--APRT--qter.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Mutant forms of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase resulting in enzyme
deficiency (APRTD; 614723) were described by Kelley et al. (1968) and by
Henderson et al. (1969), who found the inheritance to be autosomal. A
heat-stable enzyme allele had a frequency of about 15% and the
heat-labile enzyme allele a frequency of about 85%. Kelley et al. (1968)
found apparent heterozygosity in 4 persons in 3 generations of a family.
However, the level of enzyme activity ranged from 21 to 37%, not 50%.

In a lymphoblastoid cell line from a Caucasian patient in Belgium with
complete APRT deficiency (614723), Hidaka et al. (1987) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the APRT gene (102600.0001
and 102600.0002). Gathof et al. (1991) identified homozygosity for an
APRT mutation (102600.0002) in identical twin brothers born to
nonconsanguineous German parents with APRT deficiency. In 5 patients
from Iceland with complete APRT deficiency, Chen et al. (1990)
identified a homozygous mutation in the APRT gene (D65V; 102600.0004).

In Japanese, partial deficiency of APRT leads to 2,8-dihydroxyadenine
urolithiasis (type II), whereas all Caucasian patients with 2,8-DHA
urolithiasis have been completely deficient (type I). Fujimori et al.
(1985) found that partially purified enzyme from Japanese families has a
reduced affinity for phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), as well as
increased resistance to heat and reduced sensitivity to the stabilizing
effect of PRPP. They referred to this common Japanese mutant allele as
APRT*J. In Japanese patients with APRT deficiency, Hidaka et al. (1988)
identified the molecular basis for the APRT*J allele: an M136T
(102600.0003) substitution in the putative PRPP-binding site. The mutant
enzyme showed abnormal kinetics and activity that was less than 10.3% of
normal. By a specific cleavage method using cyanogen bromide (BrCN) to
identify the M136T allele, Kamatani et al. (1989) found that 79% of all
Japanese patients with APRT deficiency and more than half of the world's
patients have this particular mutation.

Hakoda et al. (1990) made the interesting observation that 2-step
mutations leading to homozygous deficiencies at the somatic cell level,
as proposed by the Knudson hypothesis of carcinogenesis in
retinoblastoma (180200) and some other human tumors, occur at other
autosomal loci. They cloned and enumerated somatic T cells with
mutations at the APRT locus by taking advantage of the presence of
heterozygous APRT deficiency and an effective selection procedure for
homozygosity. They cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells with
2,6-diaminopurine, an APRT-dependent cytotoxin, to search for in vivo
mutational cells. In all 4 heterozygotes studied, homozygously deficient
T cells were found, at an average frequency of 1.3 x 10(-4). Among 310
normal persons, Hakoda et al. (1990) identified only 1 homozygous
APRT-deficient clone, with a calculated frequency of 5.0 x 10(-9).
Homozygous cells were found at rather high frequencies in 15 putative
heterozygotes, as reported by Hakoda et al. (1991). Analysis of genomic
DNA in 82 resistant clones from 2 of the heterozygotes showed that 64
(78%) had lost the germinally intact alleles. This approach may prove
useful for identifying heterozygotes for other enzyme deficiencies.

CYTOGENETICS

Wang et al. (1999) described a Czech patient with Morquio syndrome
(253000) who also had deficiency of APRT leading to 2,8-dihydroxyadenine
urolithiasis. They pointed out that both GALNS (612222) and APRT are
located on 16q24.3, suggesting that the patient had a deletion involving
both genes. PCR amplification of genomic DNA indicated that a novel
junction was created by the fusion of sequences distal to GALNS exon 2
and proximal to APRT exon 3, and that the size of the deleted region was
approximately 100 kb. The deletion breakpoints were localized within
GALNS intron 2 and APRT intron 2. Several other genes, including CYBA
(608508), which is deleted or mutated in an autosomal form of chronic
granulomatous disease (233690), are located in the 16q24.3 region.
However, PCR amplification showed that the CYBA gene was present in the
proband. Fukuda et al. (1996) described a Japanese patient with a
submicroscopic deletion involving GALNS and APRT in one chromosome and a
point mutation (R386C; 253000.0003) in the other GALNS allele. Wang et
al. (1999) concluded that these findings indicated that APRT is located
telomeric to GALNS, that GALNS and APRT are transcribed in the same
orientation (centromeric to telomeric), and that combined APRT/GALNS
deficiency may be more common than hitherto realized.

ANIMAL MODEL

Engle et al. (1996) used targeted homologous recombination in embryonic
stem cells to produce mice that lack APRT. Mice homozygous for a null
Aprt allele excreted adenine and DHA crystals in their urine. Renal
histopathology showed extensive tubular dilation, inflammation,
necrosis, and fibrosis that varied in severity between different mouse
backgrounds.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, 3-BP DEL, 2179TTC

In a lymphoblastoid cell line from a Caucasian patient in Belgium with
complete APRT deficiency (614723), Hidaka et al. (1987) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the APRT gene: a 3-bp
deletion (2179delTTC) in exon 4, resulting in the deletion of codon
phe173, and a 1-bp insertion (1834insT) immediately adjacent to the
splice site at the 5-prime end of intron 4 (102600.0002). This insertion
led to aberrant splicing, the absence of exon 4, frameshift, and
premature termination at amino acid 110. The enzyme activity was less
than 1% of normal and the enzyme protein was immunologically
undetectable.

.0002
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, 1-BP INS, 1834T

See 102600.0001 and Hidaka et al. (1987).

In identical twin brothers born to nonconsanguineous German parents with
APRT deficiency (614723), Gathof et al. (1991) identified a homozygous
1-bp insertion in the splice donor site of intron 4 of the APRT gene
(the numbering system used by Gathof et al. (1991) indicated that the
insertion was between bases 1831 and 1832 or 1832 and 1833). The
insertion resulted in aberrant splicing. They quoted finding of the same
mutation in 2 other Caucasian patients living in the U.S., and as one of
2 alleles in a Belgian patient with compound heterozygous APRT mutations
(Hidaka et al., 1987).

Menardi et al. (1997) demonstrated homozygosity for this common T
insertion at the exon 4/intron 4 junction, resulting in the lack of exon
4 in the APRT mRNA. This common splice site mutation had always been
found in association with a TaqI RFLP, leading to the proposal that this
splice site mutation originated from a single event (Chen et al., 1993).
However, Menardi et al. (1997) found a patient with this mutation who
was negative for the TaqI RFLP. The position of this T insertion
suggested it was a hotspot for mutational events (Chen et al., 1993).

.0003
APRT DEFICIENCY, JAPANESE TYPE
APRT, MET136THR

This mutation has been designated APRT*J.

In Japanese patients with APRT deficiency (614723), Hidaka et al. (1988)
identified a 2069T-C transition in exon 5 of the APRT gene, resulting in
a met136-to-thr (M136T) substitution in the putative PRPP-binding site.
The mutant enzyme showed abnormal kinetics and activity that was less
than 10.3% of normal.

By a specific cleavage method using cyanogen bromide (BrCN) to identify
the M136T allele, Kamatani et al. (1989) found that 79% of all Japanese
patients with APRT deficiency and more than half of the world's patients
have this particular mutation.

Kamatani et al. (1990) found that 24 of 39 Japanese patients with
2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis had only APRT*J alleles. They found
that normal alleles occur in 4 major haplotypes, whereas all APRT*J
alleles occurred in only 2. They interpreted this as meaning that all
APRT*J alleles had a single origin and that this mutant sequence has
been maintained for a long time, as reflected in the frequency of the
recombinant alleles.

Sahota et al. (1991) described DHA-lithiasis in a Japanese patient with
APRT deficiency who was heterozygous for the M136T mutation. Enzyme
studies showed decreased overall activity, with decreased affinity for
PRPP. Lithiasis had previously only been observed in homozygotes. The
polyamine pathway is thought to be the major source of endogenous
adenine in man. Whether increased polyamine synthesis could lead to
increased adenine production and predispose to DHA-lithiasis in an APRT
heterozygote, remained to be determined.

Among 141 defective APRT alleles from 72 different Japanese families,
Kamatani et al. (1992) found the met136-to-thr mutation in 96 (68%).
Thirty (21%) and 10 (7%) alleles had the TGG-to-TGA nonsense mutation at
codon 98 (102600.0005) and duplication of a 4-bp sequence in exon 3
(102600.0006), respectively.

Kamatani et al. (1996) noted that the APRT*J mutation is distributed
nearly uniformly on the 4 main islands of Japan and Okinawa, suggesting
a very early origin. Among 955 random Japanese blood samples, 7 (0.73%)
were heterozygous for the APRT*J mutation. None of 231 Taiwanese samples
contained heterozygotes for this mutation, whereas 2 (0.53%) of 356
Korean samples were heterozygous. Since the APRT*J mutation was found in
Koreans and Okinawans who shared ancestors only before the Yayoi era
(3rd century B.C. to 3rd century A.D.), the origin of the APRT*J
mutation predates 300 B.C.

.0004
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, ASP65VAL

In 5 patients from Iceland with complete APRT deficiency (614723), Chen
et al. (1990) identified a homozygous 1350A-T transversion in exon 3 of
the APRT gene, resulting in an asp65-to-val (D65V) substitution. Common
ancestry could only be identified for 2 of the cases.

.0005
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, TRP98TER

In 4 unrelated Japanese individuals with complete APRT deficiency
(614723), Mimori et al. (1991) identified a 1453G-A transition in the
APRT gene, resulting in a trp98-to-ter (Y98X) substitution.

.0006
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, 4-BP DUP, EX3

Among 141 defective APRT alleles from 72 different Japanese families
with APRT deficiency (614723), Kamatani et al. (1992) found that 10 (7%)
had duplication of a CCGA sequence in exon 3. The duplication resulted
in an APRT*Q0 (null) allele. Two other alleles, APRT*J (102600.0003) and
trp98-to-ter (Y98X; 102600.0005), accounted for 68% and 21% mutant
alleles, respectively. The different alleles with the same mutation had
the same haplotype, except for APRT*J. Evidence for a crossover or a
gene conversion event within the APRT gene was observed in an APRT*J
mutant allele.

.0007
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, LEU110PRO

In 2 sisters from Newfoundland with APRT deficiency (614723), Sahota et
al. (1994) identified a homozygous mutation in the APRT gene, resulting
in a leu110-to-pro (L110P) substitution. One of the sisters exhibited
2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis, whereas the other was disease-free.

.0008
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, 254-BP DEL AND 8-BP INS

In a Caucasian patient with complete APRT deficiency (614723), Menardi
et al. (1997) found compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the APRT
gene: a common T insertion at the IVS4 splice donor site (102600.0002)
and a novel complex mutation involving simultaneous deletion/insertion
and repair events. The second mutation involved a deletion of 254 bp and
an insertion of 8 bp exactly at the site of the deletion. Downstream of
the mutations, Menardi et al. (1997) found a 14-bp sequence of inverse
complementary to this insertion and 6 flanking nucleotides. A more
detailed analysis of the region where the deletion had occurred revealed
several informative sequence features suitable to explain how the
mutation took place.

.0009
APRT DEFICIENCY
APRT, TER-SER

In a Japanese man with APRT deficiency (614723), Taniguchi et al. (1998)
found that the physiologic stop codon of the gene, TGA, was replaced by
TCA. This base substitution generated a new HinfI restriction site, and,
using PCR and subsequent digestion by this enzyme, they could confirm
that the patient was homozygous for the base substitution. The amount of
mRNA in transformed B cells was approximately one-quarter of that in
control subjects, and no APRT proteins were detected. In eukaryotes,
unlike prokaryotes, no rescue systems for defective polypeptide
termination caused by a missing stop codon have been found. Therefore,
the outcome of the defect in this patient was unclear from present
knowledge about termination of polypeptide synthesis. The stop codon was
changed to a serine codon and the reading frame was extended to the
poly(A) addition site. The poly(A) signal AGTAAA is located 213
nucleotides downstream of the physiologic stop codon, but there are no
stop codons between them (Broderick et al., 1987). The patient developed
pseudoarthrosis after a traumatic broken arm, and was found to have
increased serum creatinine and 2,8-dihydroxyadenine crystals in his
urine. Imaging showed a small right kidney.

104700	TITLE *104700 AMYLASE, SALIVARY, A; AMY1A
;;AMYLASE, SALIVARY; AMY1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The alpha-amylases hydrolyze alpha-1,4-glucoside bonds in polymers of
glucose units. Kamaryt and Laxova (1965, 1966) found 2 amylase
isoenzymes in serum, one produced by the salivary gland and the second
by the pancreas (see 104650). In 11 of 120 children, a duplication of
pancreatic enzyme band was found on starch gel electrophoresis and in
each case 1 parent also showed the duplication. In the mouse the
salivary and pancreatic amylases are determined by genes at closely
linked loci (Sick and Nielsen, 1964). The separate loci in the human
were designated AMY1 (salivary) and AMY2 (pancreatic). Polymorphism of
both the salivary and the pancreatic serum amylases has been
demonstrated in man. Ward et al. (1971) studied amylase in saliva and
identified electrophoretic variants. Data on gene frequencies of allelic
variants were tabulated by Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

GENE STRUCTURE

Nishide et al. (1986) showed that the human salivary alpha-amylase gene
is about 10 kb long and has 10 introns.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization combined with high resolution cytogenetics,
Zabel et al. (1983) assigned the amylase gene to 1p21, the POMC gene
(176830) to 2p23, and the somatostatin gene (182450) to 3q28.

Using amylase DNA probes in somatic cell hybrids, Tricoli and Shows
(1984) mapped the amylase genes to the 1p22.1-p21 region.

Multipoint linkage analysis showed that the amylase gene cluster is
located distal to NGFB (162030) (Dracopoli and Meisler, 1990).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pronk et al. (1982) presented evidence they interpreted as indicating
duplication of the salivary amylase locus.

Gumucio et al. (1988) isolated cosmid clones containing 250 kb of
genomic DNA from the human amylase gene cluster. These clones were found
to contain 7 distinct amylase genes: 2 pancreatic amylase genes, 3
salivary amylase genes, and 2 truncated pseudogenes. Intergenic
distances of 17 to 22 kb separated the amylase gene copies.

Dracopoli and Meisler (1990) used a (CA)n repeat sequence immediately
upstream from the gamma-actin pseudogene associated with the AMY2B gene
(104660) in a study of 40 CEPH families. By PCR amplification of genomic
DNA, they identified 6 alleles with (CA)n lengths of 16 to 21 repeats.
The average heterozygosity was 0.70.

Large-scale copy number variations (LCVs) involve gains or losses of
several kilobases to hundreds of kilobases of genomic DNA among
phenotypically normal individuals. To investigate LCVs in the human
genome, Iafrate et al. (2004) applied array-based comparative genomic
hybridization (array CGH) to the genomes of 55 unrelated individuals.
The most common LCV (identified in 49.1% of the individuals studied)
encompassed the AMY1A and AMY2A locus (Groot et al., 1991). Iafrate et
al. (2004) detected relative gains (in 23.6% of cases) and losses (in
25.5% of cases) at this locus and confirmed the array CGH results using
metaphase-interphase FISH, high-resolution fiber FISH, and quantitative
PCR. In all they described more than 200 LCVs in the human genome.
Twenty-four of these variants were present in more than 10% of the
individuals studied, and 6 of these variants were present at a frequency
of more than 20%. A chromosome map indicating the location of the LCVs
was provided. Carter (2004) commented on this work and the parallel work
of Sebat et al. (2004).

Starch consumption is a prominent characteristic of agricultural
societies and hunter-gatherers in arid environments. In contrast,
rainforest and circum-arctic hunter-gatherers and some pastoralists
consume much less starch. This behavioral variation raised the
possibility that different selective pressures have acted on amylase,
the enzyme responsible for starch hydrolysis. Perry et al. (2007) found
that copy number of the AMY1 gene is correlated positively with salivary
amylase protein level and that individuals from populations with high
starch diets have, on average, more AMY1 copies than those with
traditionally low starch diets. Comparisons with other loci in a subset
of these populations suggested that the extent of AMY1 copy number
differentiation is highly unusual. Higher AMY1 copy numbers and protein
levels probably improve the digestion of starchy foods and may buffer
against the fitness-reducing effects of intestinal disease.

EVOLUTION

Groot et al. (1990) presented structural analyses of the human amylase
gene cluster that allowed them to construct a model for the evolution of
this family of genes by a number of consecutive events involving inter-
and intrachromosomal crossovers.

In a study comparing human AMY1 copy number variation with that of
chimpanzees and bonobos, Perry et al. (2007) found that the average
human has 3 times more AMY1 copies than chimpanzees, and bonobos may not
have salivary amylase at all. Outgroup comparisons with other great apes
suggested that AMY1 copy number was probably gained in the human
lineage, rather than lost in chimpanzees. It is hypothesized that
starch-rich plant underground storage organs (USOs) such as bulbs,
corms, and tubers were a critical food resource for early hominins. The
example of amylase as representative of the importance of diet as a
widespread source of selective pressure in human evolution is comparable
to that of lactase persistence (223100), which has evolved independently
in multiple populations.

obtained a cDNA encoding TM6SF1. They also identified a paralog, TM6SF2
(606563), on chromosome 19p12. The deduced 370-amino acid TM6SF1 protein
has 6 transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
of a 1.4-kb TM6SF1 transcript in spleen, testis, and peripheral blood
leukocytes.

GENE STRUCTURE

By genomic sequence analysis, Carim-Todd et al. (2000) determined that
the TM6SF1 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Carim-Todd et al. (2000) mapped the TM6SF1
gene to chromosome 15q24-q26.

;;CAP PROTEIN, ACTIN, BETA; CAPPB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CapZ was identified in chicken as an actin-binding protein composed of
alpha (see 601580) and beta subunits. From a human retina cDNA library,
Barron-Casella et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs homologous for the beta
subunit of chicken CapZ.

MAPPING

Barron-Casella et al. (1995) mapped the CAPZB gene to chromosome 1p36.1
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

HISTORY

In the course of mapping 39 ESTs on chromosome 6p24-p23, Olavesen et al.
(1997) concluded that CAPZB is located in that region flanked by EDN1
(131240) on the centromeric side and TFAP2 (107580) on the telomeric
side. However, Cooper (1999) stated that a 'simple clerical error'
occurred at the outset of this project; the EST in question does not
share sequence similarity with the CAPZB gene and, therefore, the
mapping of the CAPZB gene to chromosome 6p24-p23 is incorrect.

151442	TITLE *151442 STATHMIN 1; STMN1
;;STATHMIN; SMN;;
LEUKEMIA-ASSOCIATED PHOSPHOPROTEIN p18; LAP18;;
METABLASTIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the stathmin family sequester tubulin (see 191130) in a
ternary complex, with 2 tubulins for every stathmin-like protein.
Formation of the complex interferes with microtubule dynamics in vitro
and in vivo.

CLONING

Hanash et al. (1988) demonstrated an increased level of an 18-kD
cytosolic phosphoprotein (p18) in the cells of various types of human
acute leukemia. The cDNA that encodes p18 was cloned by Zhu et al.
(1989).

Sobel et al. (1989) suggested that this protein be called stathmin, from
the Greek 'stathmos' (relay).

By immunofluorescence microscopy, Gavet et al. (1998) detected
endogenous HeLa cell stathmin expressed in a punctate cytoplasmic
distribution, with staining concentrated around the nucleus.

By real-time quantitative RT-PCR, Bieche et al. (2003) detected stathmin
expression in all tissues examined. Expression was strongest in fetal
and adult brain, spinal cord, and cerebellum, followed by thymus, bone
marrow, testis, and fetal liver. Expression was intermediate in colon,
ovary, placenta, uterus, and trachea, and was readily detected at
substantially lower levels in all other tissues examined. Lowest
expression was found in adult liver.

GENE FUNCTION

Sobel (1991) stated that stathmin is a ubiquitous, phylogenetically
conserved protein present in the cytoplasm in a variety of
unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms. Its expression and
phosphorylation are regulated throughout development in response to
extracellular signals regulating cell proliferation, differentiation,
and function. The overall pattern of its molecular forms reflects the
activation of corresponding second messenger pathways. This
phosphoprotein is therefore a good candidate for a general relay in
signal transduction, possibly integrating diverse signals from the
cell's environment.

Kumar and Haugen (1994) observed that stathmin exists in bone cells and
proposed that the protein may play a role in altering osteoblast growth
and response to various hormonal stimuli.

Maucuer et al. (1995) identified 4 mouse proteins that could interact
with human stathmin in a yeast 2-hybrid screen of an embryonic mouse
expression library. These included a member of the heat-shock protein
family (Bip; 138120), retinoblastoma-inducible coiled-coil protein
(Rb1cc1; 606837), a putative serine/threonine kinase, and a second
protein with a coiled-coil structure.

Using antibody directed against stathmin phosphorylated on ser16, Gavet
et al. (1998) found that interphase HeLa cells were weakly stained, but
mitotic cells were strongly labeled. Staining of mitotic cells increased
from prophase to metaphase and decreased at cytokinesis. Analysis of
synchronized cell extracts showed that phosphorylation of ser16 was
detected in G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Overexpression of several
phosphorylation site mutants suggested that stathmin induces
depolymerization of interphase and mitotic microtubules in its
unphosphorylated state, but is inactivated by phosphorylation in
mitosis.

Wen et al. (2010) described a potential link between stathmin and
microtubule defects in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; 253300), a motor
neuron degeneration disorder caused by defects in the survival of motor
neuron-1 gene (SMN1; 600354) that result in insufficient SMN protein.
Stathmin was identified by proteomics analysis of Smn-knockdown NSC34
cells. Stathmin was aberrantly upregulated in vitro and in vivo, leading
to a decreased level of polymerized tubulin, which was correlated with
disease severity. Reduced microtubule densities and beta-3-tubulin
(TUBB3; 602661) levels in distal axons of affected SMA-like mice and an
impaired microtubule network in Smn-deficient cells were observed,
suggesting an involvement of stathmin in those microtubule defects.
Furthermore, knockdown of stathmin restored the microtubule network
defects of Smn-deficient cells, promoted axon outgrowth, and reduced the
defect in mitochondria transport in SMA-like motor neurons. The authors
concluded that aberrant stathmin levels may play a detrimental role in
SMA.

By screening human brain tumor transcript library supernatants with
human astrocytes to identify proteins interacting with TLR3 (603029),
Bsibsi et al. (2010) identified STMN1. Wildtype mouse astrocytes, but
not astrocytes from Tlr3-deficient mice, responded to Stmn1. STMN1 and
poly(I:C) induced the same set of transcripts in human astrocytes. STMN1
also activated intracellular TLR3 in human microglia. The STMN1 TLR3
agonist activity was dependent on an intact alpha-helical structure of
STMN1. TLR3-transfected human embryonic kidney cells failed to respond
to STMN1, suggesting a requirement for additional surface factors
present on astrocytes and microglia. Confocal microscopy of multiple
sclerosis (see 126200) lesions demonstrated colocalization of STMN1 and
TLR3 in inflamed areas, primarily in astrocytes and microglia, but only
occasionally in oligodendrocytes.

MAPPING

Ferrari et al. (1990) mapped the LAP18 gene to 1p36.1-p35 by Southern
analysis of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs and by chromosome in
situ hybridization using a p18 genomic probe. They pointed out that this
region of chromosome 1 is frequently involved in visible deletions or
loss of heterozygosity in tumors derived from neural crest cells,
particularly neuroblastomas and melanomas. The high levels of expression
of p18 in brain and neuroendocrine tumor cells, its possible role in
growth regulation, and its chromosomal location suggest that this gene
may be involved in genetic events underlying some of these tumors.

Mock et al. (1993) mapped the homologous gene to distal mouse chromosome
4 by haplotype analysis of progeny from an interspecific backcross.
Okazaki et al. (1993) showed that the stathmin gene in mouse is about 6
kb long and is located on chromosome 4 with possible pseudogenes on
chromosomes 9 and 17. The related gene SCG10 (600621) was mapped to
mouse chromosome 3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Shumyatsky et al. (2005) found that stathmin was highly expressed in the
lateral nucleus of the amygdala, as well as in the thalamic and cortical
structures that send information to the amygdala about conditioned and
unconditioned stimuli. Stathmin-knockout mice exhibited decreased memory
in amygdala-dependent fear conditioning and failed to recognize danger
in innately aversive environments. In contrast, these mice did not show
deficits in the water maze, a spatial task dependent on the hippocampus,
where stathmin is not normally expressed. The amygdala of knockout mice
showed increased amounts of microtubules, although neuronal morphology
and synaptic transmission was normal. However, whole-cell recordings
from amygdala slices isolated from stathmin-knockout mice showed
deficits in spike-timing-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). The
findings suggested that stathmin is required for the induction of LTP in
afferent inputs to the amygdala and is essential in regulating both
innate and learned fear. Shumyatsky et al. (2005) postulated that a
decrease in microtubule dynamics could result in deficits in synaptic
plasticity.

Martel et al. (2008) observed that stathmin-null female mice showed
improper threat assessment, which affected innate parental care. They
showed a profound deficiency in maternal behavior, including lack of
motivation for retrieving pups and inability to choose a safe location
for nest building. In addition, stathmin-null adult females showed
increased social interactions as hosts in the host-intruder paradigm.
RNA studies detected stathmin expression in the basolateral amygdala
(BLA). Bilateral lesions in the BLA of wildtype females resulted in
similar deficits in pup retrieval. The findings implicated stathmin as a
critical molecular component linking neural circuitry of the BLA nuclei
with innate behavior resulting from threat assessment.

607387	TITLE *607387 DYNACTIN 3; DCTN3
;;DYNACTIN COMPLEX, 22-KD SUBUNIT; DCTN22
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DCTN3 is a component of the dynactin macromolecular complex. Dynactin,
along with dynein (see 600112), is required for diverse cellular
functions, including intracellular vesicular transport, spindle
formation, chromosome movement, nuclear positioning, and axonogenesis.

CLONING

Karki et al. (1998) affinity purified DCTN3, which they called p22, from
brain using recombinant dynein intermediate chain (see 603331) as
ligand. They used the amino acid sequences of peptide fragments to clone
full-length DCTN3 from a neuron cDNA library. The deduced 185-amino acid
protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 21 kD and is primarily
an alpha-helical protein with no significant coiled-coil regions.
Northern blot analysis revealed expression of a 1-kb transcript in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in muscle and pancreas and
lower levels in brain. Western blot analysis of rat brain cytosol
revealed an apparent molecular mass of about 22 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By affinity chromatography of rat brain cytosol, Karki et al. (1998)
found that Dctn3 binds directly to the p150 subunit of dynactin (DCTN1;
601143). Immunolocalization of Dctn3 in rat cell lines revealed that it
associates with punctate cytoplasmic structures. Dctn3 localized to the
centrosome during interphase and to kinetochores and to spindle poles
throughout mitosis. Cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin subunits, including
DCTN3, localized to the cleavage furrow and to the midbodies of dividing
cells.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Mills and Jackson (2001) mapped the DCTN3
gene to chromosome 9p13.

;;KCHIP2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In the brain and heart, rapidly inactivating (A-type) voltage-gated
potassium (Kv) currents operate at subthreshold membrane potentials to
control the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes. An et al.
(2000) described 3 Kv channel-interacting proteins called KCHIPs that
bind to the cytoplasmic amino termini of Kv4-alpha subunits. See KCHIP1
(604660). The KCHIP2 cDNA encodes a 252-amino acid protein that has a
distinct amino terminus but shares approximately 70% amino acid identity
with KCHIP1 and KCHIP3 throughout a carboxy-terminal 185-amino acid core
domain containing 4 EF-hand-like motifs. Expression of KCHIP2 and Kv4
together reconstituted several features of native A-type currents by
modulating the density, inactivation kinetics, and rate of recovery from
inactivation of Kv4 channels in heterologous cells. The KCHIPs
colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with brain Kv4-alpha subunits and
are thus integral components of native Kv4 channel complexes.

GENE FUNCTION

Jeyaraj et al. (2012) provided molecular evidence that links circadian
rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice.
Specifically, they showed that cardiac ion channel expression and QT
interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit
endogenous circadian rhythmicity under the control of a clock-dependent
oscillator, Kruppel-like factor-15 (KLF15; 606465). Klf15
transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of KChIP2, a critical
subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current.
Deficiency or excess of Klf15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation,
abnormal repolarization, and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular
arrhythmias. Jeyaraj et al. (2012) concluded that their findings
identified circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for
cardiac arrhythmogenesis.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kuo et al. (2001) found that knockout mice deficient for Kchip2
exhibited normal cardiac structure and function but displayed a
prolonged elevation in the ST segment on the electrocardiogram. The
Kchip2 -/- mice were highly susceptible to the induction of cardiac
arrhythmias. Single-cell analysis revealed a substrate for
arrhythmogenesis, including a complete absence of transient outward
potassium current (I-to) and a marked increase in action potential
duration. These studies demonstrated that a defect in KCHIP2 is
sufficient to confer a marked genetic susceptibility to arrhythmias,
establishing a novel genetic pathway for ventricular tachycardia via a
loss of the transmural gradient of I-to.

604203	TITLE *604203 SYNTAXIN 8; STX8
DESCRIPTION Most membrane fusion events in eukaryotic cells are mediated by SNARE
proteins on the vesicle (v-SNAREs) and on the target membrane (t-SNAREs
or syntaxins). See alpha-SNAP (603215). By searching an EST database,
Steegmaier et al. (1998) identified mouse and human cDNAs encoding
syntaxin-8. The predicted 236-amino acid human protein shares 23%
identity with syntaxin-6 (603944). Like other syntaxins, syntaxin-8 is
anchored to membranes by a C-terminal hydrophobic domain and appears to
contain a helical domain involved in the formation of a SNARE complex
(see SNAP29, 604202). Northern blot analysis revealed that syntaxin-8
was expressed as a 1.3-kb mRNA in all human tissues tested, with the
highest levels in heart. When expressed in mammalian cells, syntaxin-8
colocalized with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Steegmaier
et al. (1998) concluded that syntaxin-8 functions as a vesicle
trafficking protein in the early secretory pathway, possibly mediating
retrograde transport from cis-Golgi membranes to the ER. Independently,
Thoreau et al. (1999) isolated syntaxin-8 as a protein that interacted
with the regulatory (R) domain of the CFTR (602421) protein in a yeast
2-hybrid screen.

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Thoreau et al. (1999) mapped the syntaxin-8 gene to
17p12.

606907	TITLE *606907 APOLIPOPROTEIN M; APOM
;;NG20, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Xu and Dahlback (1999) identified APOM through N-terminal sequencing of
proteins associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRLP). By
searching 2 liver cDNA libraries with probes designed from an EST
containing the sequence, they cloned human APOM. The deduced 188-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of about 21 kD. It contains
a potential N-glycosylation site, 2 possible disulfide bridges, and a
hydrophobic alpha-helical signal peptide that is retained in the mature
protein. Sequence analysis revealed 79% identity between the human and
mouse proteins. Northern blot analysis by Xu and Dahlback (1999)
detected restricted expression of a 750-bp transcript in liver and
kidney. Northern blot analysis of several cell lines by Albertella et
al. (1996) detected a 1.1-kb transcript in HepG2 liver cells but not in
human fibroblast, leukocyte, or monocytic cell lines. By Western blot
analysis, Xu and Dahlback (1999) found that APOM is a minor component of
high and low density lipoproteins as well as TGRLP. In vitro translation
in the presence of microsomes resulted in a protein of 26 kD, suggesting
that APOM is translocated through the membrane and glycosylated.

GENE STRUCTURE

By Southern blot analysis, Albertella et al. (1996) determined that APOM
is present in single copy in the genome.

MAPPING

By homology with the corresponding mouse gene, Ng20, which maps to
chromosome 17, and by sequence analysis, Xu and Dahlback (1999) mapped
the human APOM gene to chromosome 6p21.3, between the BAT3 (142590) and
BAT4 (142610) genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Wolfrum et al. (2005) demonstrated that mice deficient in Apom
accumulated cholesterol in large HDL particles while the conversion of
HDL to pre-beta-HDL was impaired, leading to a markedly reduced
cholesterol efflux from macrophages to Apom-deficient HDL compared to
normal HDL in vitro. Overexpression of Apom in low density lipoprotein
receptor (LDLR; 606945)-null mice protected against atherosclerosis when
the mice were challenged with a cholesterol-enriched diet. Wolfrum et
al. (2005) concluded that APOM is important for the formation of
pre-beta-HDL and cholesterol efflux to HDL, and thereby inhibits
formation of atherosclerotic lesions.

611449	TITLE *611449 EXPORTIN 4; XPO4
EXP4;;
KIAA1721
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

XPO4 belongs to a large family of karyopherins (see 602738) that mediate
the transport of proteins and other cargo between the nuclear and
cytoplasmic compartments (Lipowsky et al., 2000).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated human adult
hippocampus cDNA library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned XPO4, which they
designated KIAA1721. The 3-prime UTR contains a repetitive sequence, and
the 1,150-amino acid protein shares 99% amino acid identity with mouse
Xpo4. RT-PCR ELISA detected high to moderate expression in all human
tissues and specific brain regions examined.

Using affinity chromatography on immobilized RanGTP (see RANGAP1;
602362) to identify novel RanGTP-binding proteins in HeLa cell extract,
followed by database analysis and 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, Lipowsky et
al. (2000) cloned mouse Xpo4, which they called Exp4. The deduced
1,170-amino acid mouse protein has a calculated molecular mass of 129.9
kD. Xpo4 shares similarity over the N-terminal RanGTP-binding motif with
importin-beta family members, with highest similarity to exportin-1
(XPO1; 602559) and tRNA export receptor exportin-t (XPOT; 603180).

GENE FUNCTION

Using recombinant Xpo4 expressed in E. coli and HeLa cell extract
components, Lipowsky et al. (2000) showed that RanGTP-bound Xpo4 bound
EIF5A (600187) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS; 188350). Immunoblotting
assay of recombinant EIF5A and bound Xpo4 showed that EIF5A forms a
EIF5A-Xpo4-RanGTP complex with Xpo4 specifically and that the Xpo4-EIF5A
interaction was enhanced in the presence of RanGTP. Nuclear export
assays in permeabilized cells demonstrated that Xpo4 mediates specific
nuclear export of EIF5A. By mutation and posttranslational modification
analyses, Lipowsky et al. (2000) concluded that Xpo4-EIF5A interaction
is complex and requires large parts of the EIF5A molecule and hypusine
modification of EIF5A.

Using a protein-protein interaction screen, Kurisaki et al. (2006)
showed that human XPO4 interacted with Smad3 (603109) via the Smad3 MH2
domain. RNAi knockdown of XPO4 blocked Smad3 export, as did addition of
competing short peptides representing the Smad3-XPO4 interaction domain.
In vivo and in vitro assays showed that XPO4 mediated nuclear export of
Smad3 in a RanGTPase-dependent manner.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the XPO4
gene to chromosome 13 (TMAP RH91537).

300292	TITLE *300292 FORKHEAD BOX P3; FOXP3
;;SCURFIN;;
JM2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FOXP3, a member of the fork-winged helix family of transcription
factors, plays an important role in the development and function of
naturally occurring CD4 (186940)-positive/CD25 (IL2RA; 147730)-positive
T regulatory cells (Tregs). Tregs are involved in active suppression of
inappropriate immune responses (summary by Ricciardelli et al., 2008).

CLONING

By combining high-resolution genetic and physical mapping with
large-scale sequence analysis, Brunkow et al. (2001) identified the gene
defective in 'scurfy' (sf) mice (see ANIMAL MODEL). The protein encoded
by this gene, designated Foxp3, is a member of the forkhead/winged-helix
family of transcriptional regulators and is highly conserved in humans.
In sf mice, a frameshift mutation results in a product lacking the
forkhead domain. Genetic complementation demonstrated that the protein
product of Foxp3, scurfin, is essential for normal immune homeostasis.

Brunkow et al. (2001) compared the amino acid sequences of mouse and
human scurfin with other members of the forkhead/winged-helix/HNF3
family of proteins and found the strongest similarity to the sequence of
glutamine-rich factor-1 (FOXP1; 605515).

Chatila et al. (2000) stated that the human FOXP3 open reading frame of
1,146 bp encodes a deduced 381-amino acid protein. By PCR of a human
peripheral blood mononuclear cell cDNA library, Smith et al. (2006)
cloned full-length FOXP3 and splice variants lacking exon 2 and both
exons 2 and 7. The full-length protein contains 431 amino acids. The
variant lacking exon 2 encodes a 396-amino acid protein lacking part of
the proline-rich domain, and the variant lacking exons 2 and 7 encodes a
369-amino acid protein that also lacks a large part of the putative
leucine zipper. Smith et al. (2006) noted that mice appear to lack Foxp3
variants.

GENE STRUCTURE

Brunkow et al. (2001) determined that the mouse and human FOXP3 genes
contain 11 coding exons. Exon-intron boundaries are identical across the
coding regions of the mouse and human genes.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Chatila et al. (2000) mapped the FOXP3
gene to chromosome Xp11.23.

GENE FUNCTION

Due to similarities between the autoimmunity and inflammation produced
by manipulation of CD25-positive/CD4-positive regulatory T (Tr, or Treg)
cells and those induced by genetic defects in the FOXP3 gene, Hori et
al. (2003) investigated the contribution of Foxp3 to the development
and/or function of Tr cells in mice. RT-PCR analysis of normal mice
showed stable, constitutive expression of Foxp3 that was high in Tr
cells, low in CD4-positive/CD25-negative cells, and absent in
CD4-negative/CD8 (see CD8A; 186910)-positive T cells. Transduced
expression of Foxp3 in CD4-positive/CD25-negative cells imparted a Tr
phenotype in these cells, with low levels of cytokine expression,
compared with nontransduced or vector-only transduced cells, and high
levels of CD103 (604682), GITR (TNFRSF18; 603905), and CTLA4 (123890).
Transduced cells also showed cell-cell contact suppressive activity in
vitro, as well as suppression of autoimmunity and inflammation in vivo.
Hori et al. (2003) proposed that FOXP3 may be a master regulatory gene
and a more specific marker of Tr cells than other cell surface
molecules. They also suggested that FOXP3 transduction could be a
therapeutic mode for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

Stock et al. (2004) described a type of antigen-specific Tr cell that
developed in vivo from naive CD4-positive/CD25-negative T cells during a
Th1 polarized immune response. These Tr cells were induced by
CD8A-positive dendritic cells, produced both IFNG (147570) and IL10
(124092), and expressed the Th1 'master transcription factor' TBET
(TBX21; 604895), as well as ICOS (604558) and FOXP3. The cells inhibited
allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity in an IL10-dependent manner in
mice. Stock et al. (2004) concluded that these adaptive Tr cells are
related to, but distinct from, Th1 cells. They proposed that a spectrum
of adaptive Tr cell types exists, comprising Th1-like cells and the
previously reported Th2-like cells that are induced by CD8A-negative
dendritic cells and express the Th2 'master transcription factor' GATA3
(131320) and FOXP3.

Using a bicistronic reporter expressing red fluorescent protein knocked
in to the endogenous mouse Foxp3 locus, Wan and Flavell (2005)
demonstrated that Foxp3 was expressed predominantly in
CD4-positive/CD25-positive T cells, but also in some other CD4-positive
T-cell subsets. Stimulation of activated CD4 T cells with TGFB induced
both Foxp3 expression and suppressor T-cell function.

FOXP1, FOXP2 (605317), and FOXP3 all bind the FOX-binding site within
the IL2 (147680) promoter, and all but FOXP2 suppress IL2 promoter
activity. However, Bettelli et al. (2005) found that forced expression
of FOXP3, but not FOXP1 or FOXP2, in naive T cells suppressed not only
IL2, but also IL4 (147780) and IFNG due to its ability to physically
associate with and inhibit the cytokine gene transactivators NFKB (see
164011) and NFAT (see 600490). T cells derived from Foxp3-deficient
scurfy mice had significantly increased Nfat and Nfkb expression, which
could be lowered to physiologic levels by FOXP3 gene complementation.
Transduction of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP1; 300401)-specific
autoreactive mouse T cells with FOXP3 eliminated their ability to
mediate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Bettelli et al.
(2005) concluded that, in addition to being associated with generation
of CD4-positive/CD25-positive regulatory T cells, FOXP3 acts on mature T
cells by repressing NFAT and NFKB.

Allan et al. (2005) found that, in contrast with results in mouse,
overexpression of human FOXP3 alone or together with a splice variant
lacking exon 2 in CD4-positive/CD25-positive regulatory T cells resulted
in lower proliferation and IL2 production, but no increase in
suppressive activity. Allan et al. (2005) suggested that factors in
addition to FOXP3 are required for development of regulatory T cells.

Copolymer I (COP-I) is a random polymer of 4 amino acids (glu, lys, ala,
and tyr) enriched in myelin basic protein (MBP; 159430) that is used to
treat multiple sclerosis (MS; see 126200). Hong et al. (2005) found that
COP-I increased expression of FOXP3 in peripheral blood CD4-positive T
cells of MS patients and induced conversion of
CD4-positive/CD25-negative cells to CD4-positive/CD25-positive
regulatory T cells. Induction of FOXP3 in CD4-positive T cells was
mediated by IFNG. Mice lacking Ifng exhibited an increase in
Cd4-positive/Cd25-positive cells after COP-I treatment, but these cells
did not express Foxp3. Hong et al. (2005) concluded that COP-I-mediated
activation of FOXP3 expression and conversion of
CD4-positive/CD25-negative cells to CD4-positive/CD25-positive
regulatory T cells requires IFNG.

Smith et al. (2006) found that overexpression of full-length FOXP3 or of
the FOXP3 variants lacking exon 2 or both exons 2 and 7 reduced
CD4-positive T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion.

Pennington et al. (2006) showed that without any obvious effect on T
cell receptor-mediated selection, the normal differentiation of mouse
gamma-delta T cells into potent cytolytic and interferon-gamma-secreting
effector cells is switched towards an aggregate regulatory phenotype by
limiting the capacity of CD4+/CD8+ T cell progenitors to influence in
trans early gamma-delta cell progenitors. Unexpectedly, Pennington et
al. (2006) found that the propensity of early T cell receptor
alpha-beta(+) progenitors to differentiate into Foxp3+ regulatory T
cells is also regulated in trans by CD4+/CD8+ T-cell progenitor cells,
before agonist selection.

Ono et al. (2007) demonstrated that the transcription factor AML1/RUNX1
(151385), which is crucially required for normal hematopoiesis including
thymic T cell development, activates IL2 and IFN-gamma gene expression
in conventional CD4+ T cells through binding to their respective
promoters. In natural Treg cells, FOXP3 interacts physically with AML1.
Several lines of evidence supported a model in which the interaction
suppresses IL2 and IFN-gamma production, upregulates Treg
cell-associated molecules, and exerts suppressive activity. Ono et al.
(2007) concluded that this transcriptional control of Treg cell function
by an interaction between FOXP3 and AML1 can be exploited to control
physiologic and pathologic T cell-mediated immune responses.

Marson et al. (2007) identified FOXP3 target genes and reported that
many of these are key modulators of T cell activation and function.
Remarkably, the predominant, although not exclusive, effect of FOXP3
occupancy is to suppress the activation of target genes on T cell
stimulation. FOXP3 suppression of its targets appears to be crucial for
the normal function of regulatory T cells, because overactive variants
of some target genes are known to be associated with autoimmune disease.

Zheng et al. (2007) used genomewide analysis combining chromatin
immunoprecipitation with mouse genome tiling array profiling to identify
Foxp3 binding regions for approximately 700 genes and for an
intergenically encoded microRNA. The authors found that a large number
of Foxp3-bound genes are up- or downregulated in Foxp3+ T cells,
suggesting that Foxp3 acts as both a transcriptional activator and
repressor. Foxp3-mediated regulation unique to the thymus affects, among
others, genes encoding nuclear factors that control gene expression and
chromatin remodeling. In contrast, Foxp3 target genes shared by the
thymic and peripheral regulatory T cells encode primarily plasma
membrane proteins, as well as cell signaling proteins. Zheng et al.
(2007) concluded that distinct transcriptional subprograms implemented
by Foxp3 establish regulatory T cell lineage during differentiation and
its proliferative and functional competence in the periphery.

Zuo et al. (2007) observed that female mice heterozygous for the scurfin
mutation developed cancer at a high rate. The majority of cancers were
mammary carcinomas in which the wildtype Foxp3 allele was inactivated
and Erbb2 (164870) was overexpressed. Zuo et al. (2007) found that Foxp3
repressed transcription of the Erbb2 gene via interaction with forkhead
DNA-binding motifs in the Erbb2 promoter. FOXP3 expression was reduced
in 10 human tumor cell lines compared with normal mammary epithelial
cells and a nonmalignant cell line, and none of the tumor cell lines
expressed full-length FOXP3 transcripts.

Zuo et al. (2007) found that mouse mammary carcinomas heterozygous for a
Foxp3 mutation exhibited increased Skp2 (601436) expression.
Downregulation of FOXP3 by small interfering RNA in human mammary
epithelial cells led to increased SKP2 expression. Reporter gene assays
revealed that mouse Foxp3 directly interacted with and repressed the
Skp2 promoter. Analysis of more than 200 primary breast cancer samples
revealed an inverse correlation between FOXP3 and SKP2 levels. Zuo et
al. (2007) concluded that FOXP3 is an SKP2 transcriptional repressor.

Using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and RT-PCR,
Ricciardelli et al. (2008) showed that children with Crohn disease
(266600) treated with infliximab, an anti-TNF (191160) antibody, had
increased FOXP3-positive Tregs in their mucosa after treatment. Before
treatment, FOXP3-positive T cells were reduced compared with controls.
Ricciardelli et al. (2008) concluded that infliximab not only
neutralizes soluble TNF, but also affects the activation and possibly
the expansion of mucosal Tregs.

Zheng et al. (2009) showed that in mouse T regulatory cells, high
amounts of interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4; 601900), a
transcription factor essential for TH2 effector cell differentiation, is
dependent on Foxp3 expression. They proposed that IRF4 expression endows
T regulatory cells with the ability to suppress TH2 responses. Indeed,
ablation of a conditional Irf4 allele in T regulatory cells resulted in
selective dysregulation of TH2 responses, IL4-dependent immunoglobulin
isotype production, and tissue lesions with pronounced plasma cell
infiltration, in contrast to the mononuclear cell-dominated pathology
typical of mice lacking T regulatory cells. Zheng et al. (2009)
concluded that T regulatory cells use components of the transcriptional
machinery, promoting a particular type of effector CD4+ T cell
differentiation, to efficiently restrain the corresponding type of the
immune response.

Tsuji et al. (2009) demonstrated that suppressive Foxp3+CD4+ T cells can
differentiate into follicular B helper T cells (T-FH) in mouse Peyer
patches. The conversion of Foxp3+ T cells into T-FH cells requires the
loss of Foxp3 expression and subsequent interaction with B cells. Thus,
Tsuji et al. (2009) concluded that environmental cues present in gut
Peyer patches promote the selective differentiation of distinct helper T
cell subsets, such as T-FH cells.

Feuerer et al. (2009) examined Treg cells in mouse abdominal adipose
tissue and found that more than half of the CD4(+) T cells expressed
Foxp3, a much higher fraction than normally seen even in subcutaneous
fat; and there was progressive accumulation of CD4(+)/Foxp3(+) Treg
cells over time in the visceral, but not the subcutaneous, depot.
Comparison of the documented Treg cell signature with that of Treg cells
from abdominal fat revealed that many of the signature Treg cell genes
were not significantly up- or downregulated in the corresponding
population from visceral fat. This unique population of Treg cells was
specifically reduced in abdominal fat in insulin-resistant mouse models
of obesity, and loss- and gain-of-function experiments revealed that
these Treg cells influenced the inflammatory state of adipose tissue
and, therefore, insulin resistance. Cytokines differentially synthesized
by fat-resident Treg and conventional T cells directly affected the
synthesis of inflammatory mediators and glucose uptake by cultured
adipocytes. Analysis of paired frozen omental and subcutaneous fat
tissues from individuals with body mass indices (BMIs) in the obese to
morbidly obese range showed a correlation between BMI and the drop in
Treg cells in omental versus subcutaneous fat. Feuerer et al. (2009)
concluded that CD4(+)/FOXP3(+) Treg cells play a role in metabolic
homeostasis and in its dysregulation in obesity.

Pan et al. (2009) identified Eos (606239), a zinc finger transcription
factor of the Ikaros family, as a critical mediator of FOXP3-dependent
gene silencing in Tregs. Eos interacted directly with FOXP3 and induced
chromatin modifications that resulted in gene silencing in Tregs. Pan et
al. (2009) found that silencing of Eos in Tregs abrogated their ability
to suppress immune responses and endowed them with partial effector
function, thus demonstrating the critical role that Eos plays in Treg
programming.

FOXP3-positive Treg cells occasionally lose their suppressive phenotype
to perform a helper-like role without losing expression of FOXP3. Sharma
et al. (2013) showed that reprogramming of mouse Treg cells was
controlled by Il6 (147620)-dependent downregulation of Eos. Treatment of
Foxp3-positive Treg cells with cycloheximide showed that most retained
Eos expression (i.e., they were Eos-stable), whereas a Cd38
(107270)-positive subset rapidly lost Eos expression (i.e., they were
Eos-labile) with no change in Foxp3 expression. Thymic Treg cells from
Il6 -/- mice did not express Cd38 and did not have an Eos-labile subset.
Successful vaccination of naive mice required the
Cd38-positive/Eos-labile subset of Treg cells. However, immunodeficient
mice were fully protected from colitis by both Eos-stable and Eos-labile
Treg cells. Epigenetic analysis of spleen and thymus Treg cells revealed
significant differences in methylation between Eos-labile and Eos-stable
cells. Eos downregulation was prevented by tumor-induced Ido (147435).
Sharma et al. (2013) concluded that the Eos corepressor defines 2 sets
of FOXP3-positive Treg cells, one that is stably suppressive and the
other a labile one that is available in certain circumstances to provide
helper activity.

Using flow cytometric analysis, Casetti et al. (2009) demonstrated that,
like alpha-beta T cells, gamma-delta cells can also function as Tregs
that express FOXP3 when stimulated with phosphoantigen in the presence
of TGFB1 (190180) and IL15 (600554).

Zheng et al. (2010) described the function of 3 Foxp3 conserved
noncoding DNA sequence (CNS) elements termed CNS1-3 in T regulatory cell
fate determination in mice. The pioneer element CNS3, which acts to
potently increase the frequency of T regulatory cells generated in the
thymus and the periphery, binds c-Rel (164910) in in vitro assays. In
contrast, CNS1, which contains a TGF-beta (190180)-NFAT (see 600489)
response element, is superfluous for thymic T regulatory cell
differentiation, but has a prominent role in periphery T regulatory cell
generation in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. CNS2, although
dispensable for Foxp3 induction, is required for Foxp3 expression in the
progeny of dividing T regulatory cells. Foxp3 binds to CNS2 in a
Cbf-beta (121360)-Runx1 (151385) and CpG DNA demethylation-dependent
manner, suggesting that FOXP3 recruitment to this cellular memory module
facilitates the heritable maintenance of the active state of the FOXP3
locus and, therefore, T regulatory lineage stability. Zheng et al.
(2010) concluded that their studies demonstrated that the composition,
size, and maintenance of the T regulatory cell population are controlled
by Foxp3 CNS elements engaged in response to distinct cell-extrinsic or
-intrinsic cues.

Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 is a persistent retrovirus estimated
to infect 10 to 20 million people. The majority of infected individuals
are asymptomatic carriers, but 1 to 3% of infected individuals develop
progressive inflammation of the central nervous system (see 159580), and
about 4% of seropositive individuals develop a malignant
lymphoproliferative disorder called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma
(ATLL). Toulza et al. (2010) found that there was a high concentration
of plasma CCL22 (602957) in HTLV-1-infected individuals and that the
concentration was strongly correlated with the frequency of
FOXP3-positive cells, which express the CCL22 receptor CCR4 (604836).
CCL22 was produced by cells that expressed the HTLV-1 transactivator
protein Tax, and the increased CCL22 enhanced the migration and survival
of FOXP3-positive cells in vitro. Toulza et al. (2010) concluded that
HTLV-1-induced CCL22 causes the high frequency of FOXP3-positive cells
observed in HTLV-1 infection and that FOXP3-positive cells may both
retard the progression of ATLL and HTLV-1-associated inflammatory
diseases and contribute to the immune suppression seen in HTLV-1
infection.

Using RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis, Miura et al. (2004) showed
that the cytokine storm associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD;
see 614395) correlated with decreased FOXP3 expression in mononuclear
cells of bone marrow transplant patients. FOXP3 expression was higher in
patients without GVHD. FOXP3 expression positively correlated with the
presence of recent thymic emigrants. Miura et al. (2004) suggested that
defective thymic function contributes to the impaired reconstitution of
immune regulatory mechanisms after transplantation, and that decreased
regulatory mechanisms provide an environment that permits development of
GVHD.

Using flow cytometric analysis to identify Treg frequencies in 32 blood
donors with acute West Nile virus (WNV; see 610379) infection, Lanteri
et al. (2009) demonstrated that CD4-positive/FOXP3-positive Treg
frequencies increased in all individuals in the 3 months after the index
donation that revealed WNV RNA in plasma. However, symptomatic donors
exhibited lower Treg frequencies up to 1 year after index donation
without showing systemic T-cell or generalized inflammatory responses.
Studies in WNV-infected mice showed that symptomatic mice displayed
lower Treg frequencies than asymptomatic mice. Moreover, mice lacking
Foxp3-positive Tregs experienced increased lethality following WNV
infection compared with controls. Lanteri et al. (2009) concluded that
higher levels of peripheral Tregs after infection protect against severe
WNV disease in immunocompetent animals and humans.

Liu et al. (2010) reported that the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 (603566)
restricts the differentiation of natural T regulatory cells by
maintaining a repressive chromatin state of the FOXP3 promoter. PIAS1
acts by binding to the FOXP3 promoter to recruit DNA methyltransferases
and heterochromatin protein-1 (CBX5; 604478) for epigenetic
modifications. PIAS1 deletion caused promoter demethylation, reduced
histone H3 methylation (see 602810) at lys9, and enhanced promoter
accessibility. Consistently, Pias1-null mice displayed an increased
natural T regulatory cell population and were resistant to the
development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Liu et al.
(2010) concluded that their studies identified an epigenetic mechanism
that negatively regulates the differentiation of natural T regulatory
cells.

Although the mammalian immune system is generally thought to develop in
a linear fashion, findings in avian and murine species argued instead
for the developmentally ordered appearance (or 'layering') of distinct
HSCs that give rise to distinct lymphocyte lineages at different stages
of development. Mold et al. (2010) provided evidence of an analogous
layered immune system in humans. Mold et al. (2010) investigated whether
fetal and adult HSPCs might differ in their capacity to generate Tregs
in the thymus, because fetal T cells appear to be predisposed to
generating Foxp3+ Tregs upon stimulation in vitro, and there is an
abundance of Tregs in the peripheral tissues of midgestation fetuses.
Both fetal liver- and fetal bone marrow-derived HSPCs were found to
generate populations of CD25+Foxp3+ SP4 thymocytes. Thus it appeared
that fetal HSPCs display a heightened capacity to generate Tregs during
thymic maturation. Mold et al. (2010) provided evidence that the fetal T
cell lineage is biased toward immune tolerance. They concluded that
their observations offered a mechanistic explanation for the tolerogenic
properties of the developing fetus and for variable degrees of immune
responsiveness at birth.

Using predominantly wildtype and Hif1a (603348)-/- mouse T cells, Dang
et al. (2011) showed that Hif1a was specifically required for
differentiation of naive T cells into interleukin-17 (IL17;
603149)-expressing helper T (Th) cells. Hif1a interacted directly with
Ror-gamma-t (RORC; 602943) and acetyltransferase p300 (EP300; 602700) at
the Il17 promoter, and all 3 factors were required for optimum Il17
expression. Simultaneously, Hif1a downregulated differentiation of naive
T cells into Treg cells by directing proteasomal degradation of Foxp3 by
a mechanism that was independent of Hif1a transcriptional activity.
Differentiation of Th17 cells and loss of Treg cells was enhanced in
cultures subjected to hypoxic conditions. Knockout of Hif1a in mouse T
cells rendered mice highly resistant to Mog (159465)-induced
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of multiple
sclerosis. Dang et al. (2011) concluded that HIF1A has a role in immune
responses by controlling the balance between Th17 and Treg cells.

Pregnancy is an intricately orchestrated process where immune effector
cells with fetal specificity are selectively silenced. This requires the
sustained expansion of immune-suppressive maternal FOXP3+ regulatory T
cells (Treg cells), because even transient partial ablation triggers
fetal-specific effector T-cell activation and pregnancy loss. Rowe et
al. (2012) showed that pregnancy selectively stimulates the accumulation
of maternal FOXP3+ CD4 cells with fetal specificity using tetramer-based
enrichment that allows the identification of rare endogenous T cells.
Interestingly, after delivery, fetal-specific Treg cells persist at
elevated levels, maintain tolerance to preexisting fetal antigen, and
rapidly reaccumulate during subsequent pregnancy. The accelerated
expansion of Treg cells during secondary pregnancy was driven almost
exclusively by proliferation of fetal-specific FOXP3+ cells retained
from prior pregnancy, whereas induced FOXP3 expression and proliferation
of preexisting FOXP3+ cells each contribute to Treg expansion during
primary pregnancy. Furthermore, fetal resorption in secondary compared
with primary pregnancy becomes more resilient to partial maternal FOXP3+
cell ablation. Thus, Rowe et al. (2012) concluded that pregnancy
imprints FOXP3+ CD4 cells that sustain protective regulatory memory to
fetal antigen.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Chatila et al. (2000), who referred to the FOXP3 gene as JM2, identified
it by the positional-candidate approach as the likely site of mutations
in the disorder they referred to as X-linked autoimmunity-allergic
dysregulation syndrome (XLAAD) and known by others as IPEX (304790).
Chatila et al. (2000) detected a mutation in the FOXP3 gene in 2
unrelated kindreds.

Wildin et al. (2001) sequenced the human FOXP3 gene to determine whether
the X-linked syndrome of immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, and
enteropathy (IPEX) is the human equivalent of the scurfy mouse. They
identified a novel mutation in each proband from 4 families with IPEX.
Each mutation affected the forkhead/winged-helix domain of the scurfin
protein, indicating that the mutations may disrupt critical DNA
interactions. In a fifth family studied by Wildin et al. (2001) in which
a variant form of IPEX mapped to the pericentromeric region of the X
chromosome, no mutation in the FOXP3 gene was found. A later age of
onset, waxing and waning clinical course, and occasional compatibility
with prolonged survival had been reported in this family (Powell et al.,
1982). This contrasted with the early, unrelenting course of the
disorder seen in the other families. Wildin et al. (2001) suggested that
this fifth family may harbor a noncoding FOXP3 mutation that affects
transcriptional regulation or RNA splicing, resulting in a milder,
environmentally dependent phenotype.

Bennett et al. (2001) also identified mutations in the FOXP3 gene in
IPEX patients. They compared the mutations in FOXP3 with those in FOXE1
(602617) which result in a thyroid agenesis syndrome, and with those in
FOXC1 (601090) which cause malformation of the anterior segment of the
eye (Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly).

Bassuny et al. (2003) investigated the FOXP3 gene as a candidate for the
type I diabetes susceptibility locus IDDMX (300136). They screened the
FOXP3 gene for microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphisms and
performed an association study between the gene and type I diabetes in
the Japanese population. One microsatellite polymorphism, (GT)n, was
identified in intron 0, and a (GT)15 allele showed a significantly
higher frequency in patients with type I diabetes than in controls
(43.1% vs 32.6%, P = 0.0027). The evaluation of promoter/enhancer
activity of the (GT)n polymorphism was performed by dual luciferase
reporter assay. A significant difference in the enhancer activity
between (GT)15 and (GT)16 dinucleotide repeats was detected.

Owen et al. (2003) studied 2 kindreds (21 subjects total) with 4 male
infants (3 deceased) and 1 girl affected by IPEX. In 1 of the families
they found a novel frameshift mutation in the FOXP3 gene (300292.0008).
In the second family, the FOXP3 locus was excluded by recombination, and
no FOXP3 mutations were found. They concluded that their data provided
evidence for a nonlinked autosomal locus, suggesting genetic
heterogeneity.

Bacchetta et al. (2006) studied the phenotype and in vitro function of
CD4-positive T cells and CD4-positive/CD25(high) Treg cells in 4
children with IPEX. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that
distribution and expression of various T-cell markers was comparable
between patients and normal donor controls. Patient Treg cells showed
different degrees of suppressive activity depending on the FOXP3
mutation, but none of the patients cells could suppress autologous
responder cells. The defect was overcome after in vitro expansion of
Treg cells. Of the 4 IPEX patients, only 1, who had a mutation in codon
1 (300292.0012) that resulted in no protein expression, had impaired
transcription or translation of FOXP3. All patients had normal
proliferative responses after T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, but
they were unable to produce IL2 or IFNG. Bacchetta et al. (2006)
concluded that Treg cells can be present in normal numbers in IPEX
patients, but their capacity to suppress is impaired depending on the
type of mutation, the strength of TCR stimuli, and the genotype of the
effector T cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

'Scurfy' (sf) is an X-linked recessive mouse mutant that results in
lethality in hemizygous males 16 to 25 days after birth, and is
characterized by overproliferation of CD4+/CD8- T lymphocytes, extensive
multiorgan infiltration, and elevation of numerous cytokines (Lyon et
al., 1990; Clark et al., 1999). Similar to animals that lack expression
of either Ctla4 (123890) or Tgf-beta (TGFB1; 190180), the pathology
observed in sf mice seems to result from an inability to regulate
properly CD4+/CD8- T-cell activity. Brunkow et al. (2001) determined
that the Foxp3 gene is mutant in sf mice. A frameshift mutation results
in a product lacking the forkhead domain. Genetic complementation
demonstrated that the protein product of Foxp3, scurfin, is essential
for normal immune homeostasis.

In mice overexpressing the Foxp3 gene, Khattri et al. (2001) observed
fewer T cells. These remaining T cells had poor proliferative and
cytolytic responses and poor IL2 production, although thymic development
appeared normal. Histologic analysis showed that peripheral lymphoid
organs, particularly lymph nodes, were relatively acellular. Khattri et
al. (2001) concluded that excessive scurfin activity leads to a
hypoactive immune state, suggesting that scurfin acts as a central
regulator of T-cell activity.

By generating mice deficient in Foxp3, Fontenot et al. (2003) showed
that Foxp3 is required for the development of CD4-positive/CD25-positive
regulatory T cells. In addition, the IPEX-like lymphoproliferative
autoimmune syndrome observed in Foxp3 -/- mice resulted from a
deficiency in these regulatory T cells. The authors found that ectopic
expression of Foxp3 activated a suppressor function in
CD4-positive/CD25-negative T cells. Independently, Khattri et al. (2003)
and Hori et al. (2003) reached similar conclusions.

Wan and Flavell (2007) noted that individuals with graft-versus-host
disease, myasthenia gravis (see 254200), and multiple sclerosis have
decreased FOXP3 expression. They generated a mouse model in which
endogenous Foxp3 expression was attenuated in Tr cells. These mice were
born at a mendelian ratio. Heterozygous females were fertile and
phenotypically normal, but hemizygous males were barren and runted. Most
males developed scaly skin, and nearly all developed a blepharitis-like
condition. All mutant males died by 3 months of age due to an aggressive
lymphoproliferative autoimmune syndrome, including drastically increased
serum autoantibodies; however, thymic development was not affected. The
immune-suppressive activities of T cells with attenuated Foxp3
expression were nearly abolished in vitro and in vivo, whereas their in
vitro anergy was maintained, including preferential development into
Th2-type effector cells even in a Th1-polarizing environment. Wan and
Flavell (2007) concluded that decreased FOXP3 expression causes immune
disease by subverting the suppressive function of Tr cells and
converting Tr cells into effector cells.

Gavin et al. (2007) studied mouse T cells that actively transcribed a
Foxp3-null allele, but lacked Foxp3 protein. Using flow cytometric and
microarray analyses, they found that, although Foxp3 function was
required for Tr suppressor cell activity, Foxp3 largely amplified and
fixed preexisting molecular features of Tr cells. Furthermore, Foxp3
solidified Tr-cell lineage stability by modifying cell surface and
signaling molecules, including Foxp3-dependent repression of
phosphodiesterase-3b (PDE3B; 602047). Introduction of Pde3b into Tr
cells and transfer of these cells to T-cell-deficient mice substantially
reduced the number of Tr cells. Gavin et al. (2007) proposed that
reduced PDE3B expression may be a unique marker of Tr cells.

To determine whether dysfunction or a lack of Treg cells is
etiologically involved in pathogenesis of mouse scurfy and its human
correlate, IPEX, Lahl et al. (2007) generated BAC-transgenic mice termed
'depletion of regulatory T cell' (DEREG) mice expressing a diphtheria
toxin (DT) receptor-enhanced green fluorescent fusion protein under
control of Foxp3. Injection of DT allowed selective and efficient
detection and inducible depletion of Foxp3-positive Treg cells without
affecting Cd25-positive effector T cells. Histopathologic analysis
showed that DT injection in newborn DEREG mice ablated Treg cells and
led to development of scurfy-like symptoms with splenomegaly,
lymphadenopathy, insulitis, and severe skin inflammation. Lahl et al.
(2007) concluded that absence of Foxp3-positive Treg cells is sufficient
to induce a scurfy-like phenotype.

Lund et al. (2008) examined a role for regulatory T cells (Tregs) in
mucosal herpes simplex virus infection using Foxp3 knockin mice
harboring Treg subsets tagged with either green fluorescent protein
(GFP) or human diphtheria toxin receptor. They observed an accelerated
fatal infection with increase in viral load in the mucosa and central
nervous system after ablation of Tregs. Although augmented interferon
production was detected in the draining lymph nodes in Treg-deprived
mice, it was profoundly reduced at the infection site. This was
associated with a delay in the arrival of natural killer cells,
dendritic cells, and T cells to the site of infection and a sharp
increase in proinflammatory chemokine levels in the draining lymph
nodes. Lund et al. (2008) concluded that Tregs facilitate early
protective responses to local viral infection by allowing a timely entry
of immune cells into infected tissue.

Rowe et al. (2011) showed that expansion of Foxp3-positive Tregs during
pregnancy in mice conferred enhanced susceptibility to Listeria and
Salmonella bacterial infection. Treg ablation reduced susceptibility,
but it broke maternal tolerance to fetal antigen and triggered fetal
resorption. However, mice with Foxp3-positive cells and defective Il10
had reduced infection susceptibility without affecting pregnancy
outcome.

In affected members of a kindred with IPEX (304790), Chatila et al.
(2000) found an A-to-G substitution at position +4 of the 5-prime donor
splice junction of intron 9 of the FOXP3 gene. The substitution was not
present in 2 sibs and the parents, including the mother, indicating that
it arose de novo. Sequence analysis of RT-PCR-amplified JM2 mRNA
transcripts revealed skipping of JM2 exon 9 in transcripts of the index
case. Exon 9 skipping resulted in a frameshift at codon 273 that gave
rise to a premature stop signal at codon 286. This led to the generation
of a truncated JM2 protein that lacked the forkhead homology domain.

614530	TITLE *614530 NADH-UBIQUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE 1 ALPHA SUBCOMPLEX, 12; NDUFA12
;;B17.2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Complex I (EC 1.6.99.3) is the largest multiprotein complex of the
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. It transfers
electrons with a high redox potential from NADH to ubiquinone and
participates in the formation of a proton gradient across the inner
mitochondrial membrane, thereby providing part of the proton-motive
force for ATP production. NDUFA12 is a subunit of the hydrophobic
protein fraction of mitochondrial complex I (Triepels et al., 2000).

CLONING

Using PCR, Triepels et al. (2000) cloned NDUFA12, which encodes the
17.2-kD subunit of complex I, from a heart cDNA library. The deduced
full-length protein contains 145 amino acids.

MAPPING

Hartz (2012) mapped the NDUFA12 gene to chromosome 12q22 based on an
alignment of the NDUFA12 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AF112208) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a 10-year-old girl, born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, with
Leigh syndrome (256000) due to mitochondrial complex I deficiency,
Ostergaard et al. (2011) identified a homozygous truncating mutation in
the NDUFA12 gene (R60X; 614530.0001). The mutation was identified by
homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing. Despite a
complete absence of NDUFA12 protein in patient fibroblasts, there were
reduced amounts of fully assembled and enzymatically active complex I.
These findings suggested that NDUFA12 is required either at a late step
in the assembly of complex I or in the stability of complex I. NDUFA12
mutations were not found in 122 patients with complex I deficiency,
indicating that it is not a common cause of the disorder.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX I DEFICIENCY
NDUFA12, ARG60TER

In a 10-year-old girl, born of consanguineous Pakistani parents, with
Leigh syndrome (256000) due to mitochondrial complex I deficiency,
Ostergaard et al. (2011) identified a homozygous 178C-T transition in
the NDUFA12 gene, resulting in an arg60-to-ter (R60X) substitution. The
mutation was identified by homozygosity mapping followed by candidate
gene sequencing. Patient muscle and fibroblasts showed an isolated
defect of complex I activity, at 11% and 60% control values,
respectively. Patient fibroblasts showed a complete absence of the
NDUFA12 protein, although complex I was present at reduced levels.
Transduction with wildtype NDUFA12 restored protein expression, complex
I amount, and complex I activity. The patient had delayed motor
development, with walking at age 20 months. From age 2 years, she showed
progressive loss of motor abilities and developed scoliosis and
dystonia. At age 10 years, she had poor growth, used a wheelchair, and
had severe muscular atrophy and hypotonia. Hypertrichosis was noted.
Vision and hearing were normal, and she attended a special school where
she had learned to read and write.

612793	TITLE *612793 PHOSPHATIDYLSERINE SYNTHASE 2; PTDSS2
;;PSS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Phosphatidylserine (PS) accounts for 5 to 10% of cell membrane
phospholipids. In addition to its role as a structural component, PS is
involved in cell signaling, blood coagulation, and apoptosis. PS is
synthesized by a calcium-dependent base-exchange reaction catalyzed by
PS synthases (EC 2.7.8.8), like PTDSS2, that exchange L-serine for the
polar head group of phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine
(PE) (Sturbois-Balcerzak et al., 2001).

CLONING

By database analysis and PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Tomohiro et
al. (2009) cloned PTDSS1 (612792) and PTDSS2, which they called PSS1 and
PSS2, respectively. SDS-PAGE showed that epitope-tagged PSS1 and PSS2
localized to membrane fractions of transfected HeLa cells.

By RT-PCR of mouse tissues, Sturbois-Balcerzak et al. (2001) detected
highest Pss2 expression in testis, followed by kidney and brain. Little
to no expression was detected in white adipose and spleen.

Bergo et al. (2002) stated that both PSS1 and PSS2 contain several
predicted transmembrane domains. They used Pss2 promoter-driven
beta-galactosidase staining in 20-day Pss2 -/- mouse embryos and adult
Pss -/- mice to characterize cell type-specific expression of Pss2. In
embryos, intense staining was present in brown adipose tissue over the
dorsal thoracic cage and in peripheral nerves. Staining was intense in
brain, uterus, and testis of adult mice. In brain, expression was
confined to neurons, particularly in Purkinje cells of cerebellum and
pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In uterus,
highest expression was observed in myometrium. In testis, staining was
intense in Sertoli cells, with lighter punctate staining within Leydig
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Stone and Vance (2000) found that Pss1 and Pss2 localized exclusively to
the mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM) subcompartment of the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in rodent cell lines and in mouse liver.
Mouse liver MAM used PC and PE as substrates for PS biosynthesis,
whereas ER membranes used only PE.

Using in vitro enzyme assays, Sturbois-Balcerzak et al. (2001) showed
that mouse Pss1 used choline, ethanolamine, and serine for base
exchange, whereas Pss2 used ethanolamine and serine, but not choline.

PS is normally localized on the cell membrane inner leaflet, but it
flips to the cell surface during apoptosis. Grandmaison et al. (2004)
showed that Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in Pss1 and/or Pss2,
which resulted in reduction of in vitro serine-exchange activity by as
much as 97%, externalized normal amounts of PS during apoptosis. They
concluded that normal levels of PSS1 and/or PSS2 are not required to
generate the pool of PS externalized during apoptosis.

By assaying solubilized membranes prepared from transfected HeLa cells,
Tomohiro et al. (2009) showed that full-length human PSS1 and PSS2
increased serine base-exchange activity 2.9- and 3.5-fold, respectively.
Purified PSS1 catalyzed the conversion of both PC and PE into PS, but
PSS2 only catalyzed the conversion of PE into PS. In vitro, PSS1 also
catalyzed choline and ethanolamine base exchange for the formation of PC
and PE, respectively, but PSS2 only catalyzed ethanolamine and serine
base exchange. Serine base exchange by both enzymes occurred at a
neutral pH optimum and was dependent on Ca(2+). Furthermore, exogenous
PS inhibited serine base exchange by PSS1 and PSS2 in membrane fractions
of transfected HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, purified
epitope-tagged PSS1, but not PSS2, was activated by PS in the presence
of the detergent sucrose monolaurate, suggesting that the mechanism of
PS-mediated inhibition differs between PSS1 and PSS2.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the PTDS2 gene to chromosome 11p15.5 based on an
alignment of the PTDSS2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC001210) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

ANIMAL MODEL

Bergo et al. (2002) found that Pss2 -/- mice developed normally,
appeared healthy, and grew at the same rate as littermate controls. All
female and most male Pss2 -/- mice were fertile, but about 10% of male
Pss2 -/- mice were infertile or subfertile due to testicular atrophy.
The ability of testis, brain, and liver extracts to catalyze serine
exchange was reduced by more than 90% in Pss2 -/- mice, but the
phospholipid content of these tissues remained normal. Expression of
Pss1 mRNA was not upregulated in Pss2 -/- tissues or cells. Bergo et al.
(2002) concluded that PSS2 is responsible for the majority of serine
exchange activity in in vitro assays, but that deficiency in PSS2 does
not cause perturbations in phospholipid content or severe developmental
abnormalities.

Arikketh et al. (2008) found that intercrosses of Pss1 -/- and Pss2 -/-
mice yielded viable mice with 3 disrupted Pss alleles, but no
double-knockout mice were born. In Pss1 +/- Pss2 -/- and Pss1 -/- Pss2
+/- mice, serine exchange activity was reduced by 65 to 91%, and the
tissue content of PS and PE was decreased.

607581	TITLE *607581 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 8; SLC22A8
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 3; OAT3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using homology with rat Oat1 (SLC22A6; 607582), Race et al. (1999)
identified ESTs for SLC22A8, which they designated OAT3. They obtained
the full-length clone from a kidney cDNA library. The deduced 568-amino
acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 62.1 kD. SLC22A8
contains 12 transmembrane-spanning domains that are separated by 5
intracellular loops and 6 extracellular loops, and the N and C termini
are intracellular. It also has 3 motifs conserved in the amphiphilic
solute facilitator family of proteins. SLC22A8 shares 42 to 43% amino
acid similarity with human, mouse, and rat OAT1 and 25% similarity with
the organic cation transporters OCT1 (SLC22A1; 602607) and OCT2
(SLC22A2; 602608). Northern blot analysis revealed strong expression of
a 3.0-kb transcript in kidney, with weaker expression in brain.

By screening liver and kidney cDNA libraries for homology with rat Oat1,
Sun et al. (2001) cloned what they considered to be a splice variant of
the OAT3 sequence reported by Race et al. (1999). The deduced protein
contains 542 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected expression of
a major 2.6-kb OAT3 transcript and a minor 4.5-kb OAT3 transcript only
in kidney.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SLC22A8
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-14966).

;;MAWD-BINDING PROTEIN; MAWBP;;
MAWDBP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human liver cDNA library using the WD40
repeat region of MAWD (STRAP; 605986) as bait, Iriyama et al. (2001)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding PBLD, which they called MAWBP. The
deduced protein contains 255 amino acids and is highly conserved from
single-cell to higher eukaryotes. It shares 37% amino acid identity with
the Arabidopsis enzyme Phzf, which catalyzes hydroxylation of
phenazine-1-carboxylic acid to 2-hydroxy-phenazine-1-carboxylic acid.
RT-PCR detected variable expression of MAWBP in all human tissues
examined except skeletal muscle.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid and radiation hybrid analyses, Iriyama et al.
(2001) mapped the PBLD gene to chromosome 10q21.1.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The alpha-amylases hydrolyze alpha-1,4-glucoside bonds in polymers of
glucose units. Kamaryt and Laxova (1965, 1966) found 2 amylase
isoenzymes in serum, one produced by the salivary gland and the second
by the pancreas (see 104650). In 11 of 120 children, a duplication of
pancreatic enzyme band was found on starch gel electrophoresis and in
each case 1 parent also showed the duplication. In the mouse the
salivary and pancreatic amylases are determined by genes at closely
linked loci (Sick and Nielsen, 1964). The separate loci in the human
were designated AMY1 (salivary) and AMY2 (pancreatic). Polymorphism of
both the salivary and the pancreatic serum amylases has been
demonstrated in man. Ward et al. (1971) studied amylase in saliva and
identified electrophoretic variants. Data on gene frequencies of allelic
variants were tabulated by Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

GENE STRUCTURE

Nishide et al. (1986) showed that the human salivary alpha-amylase gene
is about 10 kb long and has 10 introns.

MAPPING

By in situ hybridization combined with high resolution cytogenetics,
Zabel et al. (1983) assigned the amylase gene to 1p21, the POMC gene
(176830) to 2p23, and the somatostatin gene (182450) to 3q28.

Using amylase DNA probes in somatic cell hybrids, Tricoli and Shows
(1984) mapped the amylase genes to the 1p22.1-p21 region.

Multipoint linkage analysis showed that the amylase gene cluster is
located distal to NGFB (162030) (Dracopoli and Meisler, 1990).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Pronk et al. (1982) presented evidence they interpreted as indicating
duplication of the salivary amylase locus.

Gumucio et al. (1988) isolated cosmid clones containing 250 kb of
genomic DNA from the human amylase gene cluster. These clones were found
to contain 7 distinct amylase genes: 2 pancreatic amylase genes, 3
salivary amylase genes, and 2 truncated pseudogenes. Intergenic
distances of 17 to 22 kb separated the amylase gene copies.

Dracopoli and Meisler (1990) used a (CA)n repeat sequence immediately
upstream from the gamma-actin pseudogene associated with the AMY2B gene
(104660) in a study of 40 CEPH families. By PCR amplification of genomic
DNA, they identified 6 alleles with (CA)n lengths of 16 to 21 repeats.
The average heterozygosity was 0.70.

Large-scale copy number variations (LCVs) involve gains or losses of
several kilobases to hundreds of kilobases of genomic DNA among
phenotypically normal individuals. To investigate LCVs in the human
genome, Iafrate et al. (2004) applied array-based comparative genomic
hybridization (array CGH) to the genomes of 55 unrelated individuals.
The most common LCV (identified in 49.1% of the individuals studied)
encompassed the AMY1A and AMY2A locus (Groot et al., 1991). Iafrate et
al. (2004) detected relative gains (in 23.6% of cases) and losses (in
25.5% of cases) at this locus and confirmed the array CGH results using
metaphase-interphase FISH, high-resolution fiber FISH, and quantitative
PCR. In all they described more than 200 LCVs in the human genome.
Twenty-four of these variants were present in more than 10% of the
individuals studied, and 6 of these variants were present at a frequency
of more than 20%. A chromosome map indicating the location of the LCVs
was provided. Carter (2004) commented on this work and the parallel work
of Sebat et al. (2004).

Starch consumption is a prominent characteristic of agricultural
societies and hunter-gatherers in arid environments. In contrast,
rainforest and circum-arctic hunter-gatherers and some pastoralists
consume much less starch. This behavioral variation raised the
possibility that different selective pressures have acted on amylase,
the enzyme responsible for starch hydrolysis. Perry et al. (2007) found
that copy number of the AMY1 gene is correlated positively with salivary
amylase protein level and that individuals from populations with high
starch diets have, on average, more AMY1 copies than those with
traditionally low starch diets. Comparisons with other loci in a subset
of these populations suggested that the extent of AMY1 copy number
differentiation is highly unusual. Higher AMY1 copy numbers and protein
levels probably improve the digestion of starchy foods and may buffer
against the fitness-reducing effects of intestinal disease.

EVOLUTION

Groot et al. (1990) presented structural analyses of the human amylase
gene cluster that allowed them to construct a model for the evolution of
this family of genes by a number of consecutive events involving inter-
and intrachromosomal crossovers.

In a study comparing human AMY1 copy number variation with that of
chimpanzees and bonobos, Perry et al. (2007) found that the average
human has 3 times more AMY1 copies than chimpanzees, and bonobos may not
have salivary amylase at all. Outgroup comparisons with other great apes
suggested that AMY1 copy number was probably gained in the human
lineage, rather than lost in chimpanzees. It is hypothesized that
starch-rich plant underground storage organs (USOs) such as bulbs,
corms, and tubers were a critical food resource for early hominins. The
example of amylase as representative of the importance of diet as a
widespread source of selective pressure in human evolution is comparable
to that of lactase persistence (223100), which has evolved independently
in multiple populations.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

HIV-1 Vpu interacts with CD4 (186940) in the endoplasmic reticulum and
triggers CD4 degradation, presumably by proteasomes. Margottin et al.
(1998) identified a human beta-transducin repeat-containing protein
(BTRCP), consisting of 569 amino acids, that interacts with Vpu and
connects CD4 to the proteolytic machinery. The human BTRCP is homologous
to Xenopus bTrCP1, yeast Met30, and Neurospora Scon2 proteins.
CD4-Vpu-BTRCP complexes have been detected by coimmunoprecipitation.
BTRCP-binding to Vpu and its recruitment to membranes require 2
phosphoserine residues (ser52 and ser56) in Vpu essential for CD4
degradation. BTRCP contains 7 WD repeats at the C terminus which mediate
binding to Vpu, and an F box near the N terminus which is involved in
interaction with SKP1 (601434), a targeting factor for
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. An F-box deletion mutant of BTRCP had a
dominant-negative effect on Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation. These data
suggest that BTRCP and SKP1 represent components of an ER-associated
protein degradation pathway that mediates CD4 proteolysis.

Activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB; see 164011) requires
phosphorylation of the NFKB inhibitor IKB-alpha (IKBA, or NFKBIA;
164008) at N-terminal serines 32 and 36 by IKB kinase-alpha (IKBKA;
600664) or IKB kinase-beta (IKBKB; 603258). Phosphorylated IKBA (pIKBA)
is then targeted for ubiquitination and destruction in the 26S
proteasome. Using affinity purification, Yaron et al. (1998) isolated a
ligase, which they denoted pIKBA-E3, from HeLa cells that binds strongly
to pIKBA and attaches ubiquitin to lysines 21 and 22. By peptide
sequencing, they identified the component of the ligase that recognizes
and ubiquitinates pIKBA as an F-box/WD40 domain from BTRC, which they
called E3RS-IKB (E3 receptor subunit for IKB). An F-box deletion mutant
of BTRC bound to but did not ubiquitinate pIKBA and acted as a
dominant-negative molecule, i.e., NFKB activation was inhibited, in
stimulated Jurkat cells in vivo.

Using SKP1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen and by searching DNA
databases, Cenciarelli et al. (1999) identified several genes encoding
F-box proteins, including FBW1A. Northern blot analysis detected
variable expression of 7.5-, 4.4-, and 2.5-kb FBW1A transcripts in
nearly all tissues examined. Epitope-tagged FBW1A distributed to both
the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Winston et al. (1999) determined by biochemical dissection and
expression of assembled recombinants that BTRC, and not other F-box
proteins, is the F protein in the SCF (SKP1, CUL1 (603134), and F
protein) complex. They showed that the SCF complex recognizes, in a
phosphorylation-dependent manner, a 21-amino acid destruction motif
(residues 21 to 41) in IKBA, as well as a conserved destruction motif in
beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806), which is also regulated by
phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. Winston et al. (1999) noted
that CTNNB1 is a component of the WNT (see WNT1; 164820) signaling
pathway, and its levels are regulated by AXIN (603816) and GSK3B
(605004). Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that Btrc
is expressed throughout the mouse embryo at day 11.5 postcoitum, with
highest levels in brain, lung, and liver. Immunofluorescence analysis
demonstrated that BTRC is expressed largely, if not exclusively, in the
cytoplasm, where pIKBA ubiquitination is thought to occur.

Spencer et al. (1999) pointed out that BTRC is the vertebrate homolog of
the Drosophila Slimb protein. They found that BTRC ubiquitinates pIKBA
at specific lysines in the presence of ubiquitin-activating and
-conjugating enzymes (see 603890).

Maniatis (1999) reviewed the roles of BTRC and the SCF complex in the
NFKB, WNT, and hedgehog (see 600725) signaling pathways.

Cenciarelli et al. (1999) showed that in vitro translated FBW1A
interacted with SKP1 in an in vitro pull-down assay. The F box of FBW1A
was required for this interaction.

Neish et al. (2000) observed abrogation of ubiquitination of
phosphorylated CTNNB1 and IKBA, but not of other proteins, in a model
epithelial system with nonpathogenic Salmonella, suggesting that the
effect of the nonpathogenic bacteria is specific to the SCF complex
substrates CTNNB1 and IKBA.

The Drosophila circadian clock is driven by daily fluctuations of the
proteins Period (Per; 602260) and Timeless (Tim; 603887), which
associate in a complex and negatively regulate the transcription of
their own genes. Protein phosphorylation has a central role in this
feedback loop, by controlling Per stability in both cytoplasmic and
nuclear compartments, as well as Per/Tim nuclear transfer. Grima et al.
(2002) demonstrated that the product of the slimb (slmb) gene is an
essential component of the Drosophila circadian clock. slmb mutants are
behaviorally arrhythmic, and can be rescued by targeted expression of
slmb in the clock neurons. In constant darkness, highly phosphorylated
forms of the Per and Tim proteins are constitutively present in the
mutants, indicating that the control of their cyclic degradation is
impaired. Because levels of Per and Tim oscillate in slmb mutants
maintained in light:dark conditions, light- and clock-controlled
degradation of Per and Tim do not rely on the same mechanisms.

Casein kinase I-epsilon (600863) has a prominent role in regulating the
phosphorylation and abundance of Per proteins in animals. Using a
Drosophila cell culture system, Ko et al. (2002) demonstrated that
Double-time, the Drosophila homolog of CKI-epsilon, promotes the
progressive phosphorylation of Per, leading to the rapid degradation of
hyperphosphorylated isoforms by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Slimb,
an F-box/WD40-repeat protein functioning in the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway, interacts preferentially with phosphorylated Per and stimulates
its degradation. Overexpression of slimb or expression in clock cells of
a dominant-negative version of slimb disrupts normal rhythmic activity
in flies. Ko et al. (2002) concluded that hyperphosphorylated Per is
targeted to the proteasome by interactions with Slimb.

Noubissi et al. (2006) demonstrated that beta-catenin stabilizes the
mRNA encoding the F-box protein BTRCP1 and identified the RNA-binding
protein CRDBP (608288) as a target of beta catenin/Tcf transcription
factor. CRDBP binds to the coding region of BTRCP1 mRNA. Overexpression
of CRDBP stabilized BTRCP1 mRNA and elevated BTRCP1 levels both in cells
and in vivo, resulting in the activation of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box
protein (SCF)-BTRCP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and in accelerated turnover of
its substrates including I-kappa-B (see 164008) and beta-catenin. CRDBP
is essential for the induction of both BTRCP1 and c-Myc (190080) by
beta-catenin signaling in colorectal cancer cells. Noubissi et al.
(2006) concluded that high levels of CRDBP that are found in primary
human colorectal tumors exhibiting active beta-catenin/Tcf signaling
implicates CRDBP induction in the upregulation of BTRCP1, in the
activation of dimeric transcription factor NF-kappa-B (see 164011), and
in the suppression of apoptosis in these cancers.

Claspin (CLSPN; 605434) is an adaptor protein required for activation of
CHK1 (CHEK1; 603078), a central component of DNA checkpoint signaling.
Mailand et al. (2006) and Peschiaroli et al. (2006) found that claspin
became degraded at the onset of mitosis. Claspin degradation was
triggered by its interaction with and ubiquitylation by BTRC. The
BTRC-claspin interaction was phosphorylation dependent and required PLK1
(602098) activity and integrity of the BTRC degradation motif in the N
terminus of claspin. Mailand et al. (2006) found that uncoupling claspin
from BTRC by mutating the conserved serines in the degradation motif or
by BTRC knockdown stabilized claspin in mitosis, impaired CHK1
dephosphorylation, and delayed G2/M transition during recovery from cell
cycle arrest imposed by DNA damage or replication stress. The inability
to degrade claspin allowed partial reactivation of CHK1 in cells exposed
to DNA damage after passing the G2/M transition. Peschiaroli et al.
(2006) found that expression of a stable claspin mutant unable to bind
BTRC prolonged activation of CHK1, thereby attenuating recovery from the
DNA replication stress response and significantly delaying entry into
mitosis.

Dorrello et al. (2006) found that the tumor suppressor programmed cell
death protein-4 (PDCD4; 608610) inhibits the translation initiation
factor EIF4A (see 602641), an RNA helicase that catalyzes the unwinding
of secondary structure at the 5-prime untranslated region of mRNAs. In
response to mitogens, PDCD4 was rapidly phosphorylated on ser67 by the
protein kinase S6K1 (608938) and subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin
ligase SCF-beta(TRCP). Expression in cultured cells of a stable PDCD4
mutant that was unable to bind beta-TRCP inhibited translation of an
mRNA with a structured 5-prime untranslated region, resulted in smaller
cell size, and slowed down cell cycle progression. Dorrello et al.
(2006) proposed that regulated degradation of PDCD4 in response to
mitogens allows efficient protein synthesis and consequently cell
growth.

Using an unbiased screen, Guardavaccaro et al. (2008) demonstrated that
REST (600571) is an interactor with the F-box protein beta-TRCP. REST is
degraded by means of the ubiquitin ligase beta-TRCP during the G2 phase
of the cell cycle to allow transcriptional derepression of Mad2
(601467), an essential component of the spindle assembly checkpoint. The
expression in cultured cells of a stable REST mutant, which is unable to
bind beta-TRCP, inhibited Mad2 expression and resulted in a phenotype
analogous to that observed in Mad2 heterozygous cells. In particular,
Guardavaccaro et al. (2008) observed defects that were consistent with
faulty activation of the spindle checkpoint, such as shortened mitosis,
premature sister-chromatid separation, chromosome bridges and
missegregation in anaphase, tetraploidy, and a faster mitotic slippage
in the presence of a spindle inhibitor. An indistinguishable phenotype
was observed by expressing the oncogenic REST-FS mutant, which does not
bind beta-TRCP. Thus, beta-TRCP-dependent degradation of REST during G2
permits the optimal activation of the spindle checkpoint, and
consequently it is required for the fidelity of mitosis.

Westbrook et al. (2008) showed that REST is regulated by
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and used an RNA interference screen to
identify a Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein complex containing the F-box protein
beta-TRCP as an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for REST degradation.
Beta-TRCP binds and ubiquitinates REST and controls its stability
through a conserved phospho-degron. During neural differentiation, REST
is degraded in a beta-TRCP-dependent manner. Beta-TRCP is required for
proper neural differentiation only in the presence of REST, indicating
that beta-TRCP facilitates this process through degradation of REST.
Conversely, failure to degrade REST attenuates differentiation.
Furthermore, Westbrook et al. (2008) found that beta-TRCP
overexpression, which is common in human epithelial cancers, causes
oncogenic transformation of human mammary epithelial cells and that this
pathogenic function requires REST degradation. Thus, Westbrook et al.
(2008) concluded that REST is a key target in beta-TRCP-driven
transformation and that the beta-TRCP-REST axis is a new regulatory
pathway controlling neurogenesis.

Pierce et al. (2009) developed a quantitative framework based on product
distribution that predicted that the really interesting new gene (RING)
E3 enzymes SCF(Cdc4) (see 606278) and SCF-beta-TrCP work with the E2
Cdc34 (116948) to build polyubiquitin chains on substrates by sequential
transfers of single ubiquitins. Measurements with millisecond time
resolution directly demonstrated that substrate polyubiquitylation
proceeds sequentially. Pierce et al. (2009) concluded that their results
presented an unprecedented glimpse into the mechanism of RING ubiquitin
ligases and illuminated the quantitative parameters that underlie the
rate and pattern of ubiquitin chain assembly.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

De Mollerat et al. (2003) conducted mutation analysis of the dactylin
gene (DAC; 608071) in 7 patients with split-hand/split-foot malformation
(SHFM3; 246560) and found no point mutations. However, Southern blot,
pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and dosage analyses demonstrated a
complex rearrangement associated with a 0.5-Mb tandem duplication in all
the patients. This duplicated region contained a disrupted extra copy of
the dactylin gene and the entire LBX1 (604255), BTRC, and POLL (606343)
genes. Similar to BTRC, DAC has been shown to be an F-box/WD40-repeat
protein involved in NFKB signaling. The authors hypothesized that
dysregulation of DAC and/or BTRC expression may be responsible for the
defect in limb development seen in these patients.

Lyle et al. (2006) used FISH and quantitative PCR to narrow the SHFM3
locus to a minimal 325-kb duplication containing only the BTRC and POLL
genes. Expression analysis of 13 candidate genes within and flanking the
duplicated region showed that BTRC and SUFU (607035), present in 3
copies and 2 copies, respectively, were overexpressed in SHFM3 patients
compared to controls. Lyle et al. (2006) suggested that SHFM3 may be
caused by overexpression of BTRC and SUFU, both of which are involved in
beta-catenin signaling.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis and FISH, Fujiwara et al. (1999) mapped the
BTRC gene to chromosome 10q24-q25. Winston et al. (1999) mapped the BTRC
gene to 10q24 by FISH. They noted that this region displays genetic
abnormalities in a limited number of prostate, melanocyte, and neural
cancers.

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the BTRC gene maps to chromosome
10q24.32 and the mouse Btrc gene maps to chromosome 19C3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Guardavaccaro et al. (2003) found that loss of Btrc in mice did not
affect viability, but it induced an impairment of spermatogenesis and
reduced male fertility.

Kudo et al. (2004) found that mammary glands of female Btrc -/- mice
showed reduced branching and hypoplasia. They observed no differences
between mutant and wildtype mammary glands during pubertal ductal
elongation, pregnancy, and lactation, the times of maximal hormonal
stimulation. To further investigate the role of Btrc in mammary gland
development, Kudo et al. (2004) generated transgenic mice expressing
human BTRC targeted to mammary epithelia. Transgenic mammary glands
displayed increased lateral ductal branching and extensive arrays of
alveolus-like protuberances. The mammary epithelia of transgenic mice
proliferated more and showed increased NFKB DNA-binding activity and
higher nuclear levels of NFKB p65 (RELA; 164014). In addition, 38% of
transgenic mice developed tumors, including mammary, ovarian, and
uterine carcinomas. Targeting the BTRC gene to lymphoid organs produced
no effects in these tissues.

610737	TITLE *610737 KINASE SUPPRESSOR OF RAS 2; KSR2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By database analysis, followed by PCR of a human testis cDNA library,
Channavajhala et al. (2003) cloned KSR2. The predicted 829-amino acid
protein has a molecular mass of approximately 105 kD. Similar to KSR1
(601132), KSR2 appears to lack the CA1 domain. KSR2 shares 61% amino
acid identity with KSR1. Northern blot analysis revealed expression
mainly in kidney and brain. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that
KSR2 interacted with components of the MAPK pathway, including RAF
(RAF1; 164760), MEK (MAP2K1; 176872), and ERK (MAPK3; 601795).

GENE FUNCTION

Channavajhala et al. (2003) showed that both full-length KSR2 and the
C-terminal catalytic domain of KSR2 associated with COT (MAP3K8;
191195). Cotransfection of KSR2 with COT in HEK-293T cells lead to
reduced COT-mediated ERK activation in a dose-dependent manner; however,
RAF-mediated ERK activation was not significantly attenuated by
coexpression with KSR2, suggesting that the effect is selective.
Luciferase reporter assays showed that KSR2 inhibited COT-induced
NF-kappa-B (164011) activation but did not inhibit IKKB
(603258)-mediated NF-kappa-B activation. In vitro kinase assays showed
that KSR2 negatively regulated the kinase activity of COT. COT kinase
activity regulated IL8 (146930) production in HeLa cells, and
coexpression of KSR2 markedly reduced COT-induced IL8 production.

Channavajhala et al. (2005) showed that cotransfection of KSR2 with
MEKK3 (MAP3K3; 602539) in HEK293T cells significantly reduced
MEKK3-mediated ERK activation but did not affect ERK activation by other
MAP3Ks. KSR2 also significantly reduced MEKK3-induced NF-kappa-B
activation, to near background levels, in the IL1B (147720)-mediated
proinflammatory pathway and downregulated MEKK3-induced IL8 production
in response to IL1B stimulation. Channavajhala et al. (2005) concluded
that KSR2 specifically regulates the activity of MEKK3 and COT but not
other members of the MAP3K family.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Brennan et al. (2011) integrated structural and biochemical studies to
understand how KSR promotes stimulatory Raf phosphorylation of MEK. They
showed, from the crystal structure of the kinase domain of human KSR2
(KSR2(KD)) in complex with rabbit MEK1 (176872), that interactions
between KSR2 kinase domain and MEK1 are mediated by their respective
activation segments and C-lobe alpha-G helices. Analogous to BRAF
(164757), KSR2 self-associates through a side-to-side interface
involving arg718, a residue identified in a genetic screen as a
suppressor of Ras signaling. ATP is bound to the KSR2(KD) catalytic
site, and Brennan et al. (2011) demonstrated KSR2 kinase activity
towards MEK1 by in vitro assays and chemical genetics. In the
KSR2(KD)-MEK1 complex, the activation segments of both kinases are
mutually constrained, and KSR2 adopts an inactive conformation. BRAF
allosterically stimulates the kinase activity of KSR2, which is
dependent on formation of a side-to-side KSR2-BRAF heterodimer.
Furthermore, KSR2-BRAF heterodimerization results in an increase of
BRAF-induced MEK phosphorylation via the KSR2-mediated relay of a signal
from BRAF to release the activation segment of MEK for phosphorylation.
Brennan et al. (2011) proposed that KSR interacts with a regulatory Raf
molecule in cis to induce a conformational switch of MEK, facilitating
MEK's phosphorylation by a separate catalytic Raf molecule in trans.

609768	TITLE *609768 BIOGENESIS OF LYSOSOME-RELATED ORGANELLES COMPLEX 1, SUBUNIT 2; BLOC1S2
;;BLOC1, SUBUNIT 2; BLOS2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

BLOC1S2 is a component of the ubiquitously expressed BLOC1 multisubunit
protein complex. BLOC1 is required for normal biogenesis of specialized
organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and
platelet dense granules (Starcevic and Dell'Angelica, 2004).

CLONING

Using the BLOC1 subunit pallidin (PLDN; 604310) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica
(2004) cloned BLOC1S2, which they called BLOS2. The deduced BLOS2
protein contains coiled-coil regions and has a calculated molecular mass
of 16 kD. Western blot analysis detected endogenous HeLa cell BLOS2 at
an apparent molecular mass of 18 kD.

GENE FUNCTION

By mass spectrometry of BLOC1 proteins purified from bovine liver, mouse
liver, and HeLa cells, Starcevic and Dell'Angelica (2004) identified
BLOS2 as a subunit of BLOC1. Other BLOC1 subunits identified were
pallidin, muted (607289), dysbindin (DTNBP1; 607145), cappuccino
(605695), snapin (SNAPAP; 607007), BLOC1S1 (601444), and BLOC1S3
(609762). Coimmunoprecipitation and yeast 2-hybrid analyses confirmed
that these proteins interact within the BLOC1 complex.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the BLOC1S2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP RH47426).

140556	TITLE *140556 HEAT-SHOCK 70-KD PROTEIN 7; HSPA7
;;HSP70B
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the coding region of Drosophila Hsp70 to screen a human genomic
phage library, Voellmy et al. (1985) cloned a segment of a gene encoding
a 70-kD heat shock protein, designated HSP70B by Schiller et al. (1988).

Leung et al. (1990) found high sequence homology between HSP70B (HSPA7)
and HSPA6 (140555), formerly designated HSP70B-prime. Leung et al.
(1992) stated that both HSPA6 and HSPA7 represent functional genes, as
determined by analyses of mRNA from heat-shocked human cells using
sequence-specific oligonucleotides. After heat shock at 45 degrees C,
HSPA6 mRNA was detected in fibroblast, HeLa, and Daudi cells, whereas
HSPA7 mRNA was detected only in fibroblasts.

Parsian et al. (2000) presented evidence that HSPA7 does not encode a
full-length functional protein. They did not detect orthologs of HSPA7
or HSPA6 in mouse by Southern blot analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Using Xenopus and mammalian cells, Voellmy et al. (1985) demonstrated
that the expression of HSPA7 mRNA is heat regulated. Using RT-PCR,
Parsian et al. (2000) detected the expression of HSPA7 and HSPA6 only
after heat shock in human W138 and HeLa cells. HSPA6 was more strongly
expressed following heat shock.

GENE STRUCTURE

Voellmy et al. (1985) determined that the promoter region of the HSPA7
gene is GC-rich and lacks CCAAT and TATA elements. Schiller et al.
(1988) extended the upstream nucleotide sequence of HSPA7 and identified
4 potential heat shock transcription factor recognition sites. They also
identified upstream CCAAT-like sequence and many potential SP1
(189906)-binding sites.

MAPPING

By hybridization analyses of a somatic cell hybrid DNA panel, Leung et
al. (1992) found that HSPA6 and HSPA7 localize to 1q. A BamHI
polymorphism in the HSPA7 gene was present in a predominantly Asian
population.

Grosz et al. (1992) concluded that bovine HSP70-4 is homologous to HSPA6
or HSPA7 because it is syntenic with amylase-1 (104700) and PGM1
(171900), both of which are on human chromosome 1.

Using FISH, Parsian et al. (2000) mapped the HSPA6 and HSPA7 genes to
within 5 to 10 Mb of each other on chromosome 1q23.1.

Brzustowicz et al. (2002) stated that the HSPA6 and HSPA7 genes are
located on chromosome 1q22, according to sequence data provided by the
Human Genome Project, and are in close proximity to a susceptibility
locus for schizophrenia (604906).

614642	TITLE *614642 START DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 9; STARD9
;;KIAA1300
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

STARD9 belongs to the kinesin-3 family of ATPases (see KIF1A; 601255)
involved in transporting vesicles and organelles (Torres et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned STARD9, which they designated
KIAA1300. The deduced protein contains 1,820 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected highest STARD9 expression in adult lung. Moderate expression
was detected in all other adult and fetal tissues and adult brain
regions examined except skeletal muscle, which showed low STARD9
expression.

Halama et al. (2006) determined that the 1,820-amino acid STARD9 protein
contains a START lipid-binding domain. By database analysis, they
identified a STARD9 splice variant lacking exon 8. Database analysis
revealed STARD9 orthologs in mammals, chicken, and pufferfish.

By characterizing proteins that copurified with polymerized microtubule
asters and that were required for mitotic progression in HeLa cells,
Torres et al. (2011) identified STARD9. The deduced full-length protein
contains 4,614 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 506.7
kD. The N terminus of full-length STARD9 has a motor domain and an FHA
domain, and the C terminus has a coiled-coil region and a START domain.
The motor domain of STARD9 shares highest similarity with the motor
domains of KIF16B and KIF1A. Torres et al. (2011) identified 2
additional isoforms of STARD9. One, a 323-amino acid protein, lacks 84
N-terminal amino acids of full-length STARD9 that are essential for
ATPase activity. The other, a 292-amino acid protein, is nearly
identical to the N-terminal end of full-length STARD9, but it lacks part
of the motor domain. Torres et al. (2011) found that STARD9 was
expressed at low levels in all tissues examined. Immunohistochemical
analysis of HeLa cells detected STARD9 throughout the nucleus and
cytoplasm in interphase and localized to daughter centrioles from
prophase to late anaphase. STARD9 was not detected during cytokinesis.
Orthologs of STARD9 were found in vertebrates only.

GENE FUNCTION

Torres et al. (2011) found that the isolated motor domain of STARD9
showed ATPase activity and bound microtubules. Mutation analysis
revealed a critical role for thr110 in STARD9 ATPase activity and for
arg223 within the switch-1 region in STARD9 microtubule binding. Both
residues were involved in localization of the motor domain to
centrosomes. Knockdown of STARD9 in HeLa cells via small interfering RNA
led to fragmentation and dissociation of the pericentriolar material,
multipolar spindles, activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint,
mitotic arrest, and apoptosis. Overexpression of the STARD9 motor domain
partially rescued fragmentation of pericentriolar material following
STARD9 depletion. Knockdown of STARD9 had little effect on mitotic
progression or apoptosis in normal cells and in a significant subset of
tumor cell lines. Chemical inhibition of the mitotic regulators CDK1
(116940), PLK1 (602098), and kinesin-5 (KIF11; 602821) and
nocodazole-dependent depolymerization of microtubules reduced
fragmentation of pericentriolar material in STARD9-knockdown cells.
Nocodazole also eliminated localization of STARD9 to centrioles. Torres
et al. (2011) hypothesized that STARD9 stabilizes pericentriolar
material under microtubule-mediated tension during bipolar spindle
assembly and may form a link between the daughter centriole and
pericentriolar material.

GENE STRUCTURE

Halama et al. (2006) determined that the STARD9 gene contains 11 exons.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the STARD9
gene to chromosome 15. Halama et al. (2006) mapped the STARD9 gene to
chromosome 15q15 by genomic sequence analysis.

610922	TITLE *610922 NUCLEAR PORE ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; NPAP1
;;CHROMOSOME 15 OPEN READING FRAME 2; C15ORF2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing YAC clones containing a CpG island in the Prader-Willi
syndrome (PWS; 176270) critical region on chromosome 15, followed by
database analysis and PCR and 3-prime RACE of a human testis cDNA
library, Farber et al. (2000) cloned C15ORF2. The deduced protein
contains 1,156 amino acids. Northern blot analysis detected a 7.5-kb
transcript in adult testis, but not in fetal testis or in any other
adult or fetal tissues examined. Southern blot analysis detected C15ORF2
in several primates, but not in any other mammalian or avian species
examined. The primate sequences share between 97 and 99% identities.

GENE FUNCTION

Farber et al. (2000) found that a CpG island associated with C15ORF2 was
methylated in all tissues tested except for germ cells. Although C15ORF2
maps between the imprinted genes MAGEL2 (605283) and SNRPN (182279),
they demonstrated that C15ORF2 was biallelically expressed in adult
testis.

Buiting et al. (2007) found that C15ORF2 was monoallelically expressed
in fetal brain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Farber et al. (2000) determined that C15ORF2 is an intronless gene with
its start codon imbedded within a CpG island.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Farber et al. (2000) mapped the C15ORF2
gene to chromosome 15q11-q13. Southern blot analysis indicated that
C15ORF2 is a single-copy gene.

604481	TITLE *604481 SIRTUIN 3; SIRT3
;;SIR2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE 3; SIR2L3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases and
mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases control a variety of cellular processes,
such as aging, metabolism, and gene silencing. SIRT3 functions as a
mitochondrial deacetylase (summary by Lombard et al., 2007).

CLONING

The yeast Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) protein (Shore et al.,
1984) regulates epigenetic gene silencing and, as a possible antiaging
effect, suppresses recombination of rDNA. Studies involving cobB, a
bacterial Sir2-like gene, have suggested that Sir2 may encode a pyridine
nucleotide transferase. By in silico and PCR cloning techniques, Frye
(1999) obtained cDNA sequences encoding 5 human Sir2-like genes, which
they called sirtuin-1 to -5 (SIRT1 to SIRT5). The SIRT1 (604479)
sequence has the closest homology to the S. cerevisiae Sir2 protein,
while SIRT4 (604482) and SIRT5 (604483) more closely resemble
prokaryotic sirtuin sequences. PCR analysis showed that the 5 human
sirtuins are widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues.

By PCR of a human spleen cDNA library, Schwer et al. (2002) cloned
SIRT3. The deduced 399-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
mitochondrial targeting signal and a central catalytic domain.
Fluorescence-tagged SIRT3 localized to mitochondria of transfected HeLa
cells. Western blot analysis of human embryonic kidney cells detected
endogenous SIRT3 peptides of about 44 and 28 kD.

Using immunofluorescence analysis, Scher et al. (2007) showed that
full-length SIRT3 localized to both HeLa cell nuclei and mitochondria.

By Western blot analysis of mouse tissues, Lombard et al. (2007) found
that Sirt3 was highly expressed in mitochondria-rich tissues: brain,
heart, liver, and brown adipose tissue. Subcellular fractionation
revealed that Sirt3 localized to mitochondria.

GENE FUNCTION

Tanny et al. (1999) showed that the yeast Sir2 protein can transfer
labeled phosphate from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to itself and
histones in vitro. A modified form of Sir2, which results from its
automodification activity, was specifically recognized by
anti-mono-ADP-ribose antibodies, suggesting that Sir2 is an
ADP-ribosyltransferase. Mutation of a phylogenetically invariant
histidine (his364 to tyr) in Sir2 abolished both its enzymatic activity
in vitro and its silencing functions in vivo. However, the mutant
protein was associated with chromatin and other silencing factors in a
manner similar to wildtype Sir2. These findings suggested that Sir2
contains an ADP-ribosyltransferase activity that is essential for its
silencing function.

Although the SIRT3 gene, located in a large imprinted gene domain on
11p15.5, is not imprinted, Onyango et al. (2002) found that it is
localized to mitochondria, with a mitochondrial targeting signal within
a unique N-terminal peptide sequence. The encoded protein was found also
to possess NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase activity. These results
suggested a previously unrecognized organelle for sirtuin function and a
role for SIRT3 in mitochondria involving protein deacetylation.

Schwer et al. (2002) assayed endogenous SIRT3 in the mitochondrial
fraction of human embryonic kidney cells and found that it had specific
NAD-dependent deacetylase activity. Mitochondrial import of SIRT3
depended on an N-terminal amphipathic alpha helix rich in basic
residues. SIRT3 was proteolytically processed in the mitochondrial
matrix to a 28-kD product, and this processing was reconstituted in
vitro with recombinant mitochondrial matrix processing peptidase (MPP;
see 603131). Mutation analysis showed that SIRT3 was cleaved between
arg99 and arg100. The unprocessed form of SIRT3 was enzymatically
inactive and became fully activated in vitro after cleavage by MPP.

Scher et al. (2007) showed that both the full-length and processed forms
of SIRT3 had strong NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylation activity in
vitro, with specificity for lys16 of H4 (see 602822) and, to a lesser
extent, lys9 of H3 (see 602810). SIRT3 could repress transcription of a
target gene in vivo when recruited to its promoter. Full-length SIRT3
was transported from the nucleus to the mitochondria following cell
stresses, such as DNA damage and ultraviolet irradiation, as well as by
SIRT3 overexpression. Transport was inhibited by leptomycin B, a nuclear
export inhibitor.

MAPPING

Frye (1999) stated that the SIRT3 gene is contained within a YAC clone
(GenBank GENBANK AF015416) from the 11p15.5 region.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Bellizzi et al. (2005) identified a variable number of tandem repeats
(VNTR) polymorphism of a 72-bp repeat core in intron 5 of the SIRT3
gene. Alleles differed both in the number of repeats and in the presence
of either a GATA3 (131320) or a delta-EF1 (TCF8; 189909) regulatory
site. Transient transfection experiments demonstrated that the VNTR
region has allele-specific enhancer activity. Bellizzi et al. (2005)
analyzed allele frequencies as a function of age in a sample of 945
individuals between 20 and 106 years of age and found that the allele
completely lacking enhancer activity was virtually absent in males older
than 90 years. The association between VNTR alleles and longevity was
restricted to males, because no difference was observed either in the
genotypic or in the allelic pool between females of younger or older
ages.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lombard et al. (2007) found that Sirt3 -/- mice were born at the
expected mendelian ratio, developed normally, and were indistinguishable
from wildtype. Sirt3 -/- mice were metabolically unremarkable under both
fed and fasted conditions, and they showed normal adaptive
thermogenesis.

Ahn et al. (2008) found that Sirt3 -/- mice appeared indistinguishable
from wildtype mice. However, heart, kidney, and liver of Sirt3 -/- mice,
as well as Sirt3 -/- embryonic fibroblasts, showed reduced basal ATP
levels. In the absence of Sirt3, multiple components of complex I of the
electron transport chain demonstrated increased acetylation.
Mitochondria from Sirt3 -/- mice displayed selective inhibition of
complex I activity, and incubation of exogenous Sirt3 with mutant
mitochondria augmented complex I activity. Ahn et al. (2008) concluded
that SIRT3 regulates and maintains basal ATP levels.

In mice, Hirschey et al. (2010) demonstrated that Sirt3 expression is
upregulated during fasting in liver and brown adipose tissues. During
fasting, livers from mice lacking Sirt3 had higher levels of fatty acid
oxidation intermediate products and triglycerides, associated with
decreased levels of fatty acid oxidation, compared to livers from
wildtype mice. Mass spectrometry of mitochondrial proteins showed that
Lcad (609576) was hyperacetylated at lysine-42 in the absence of Sirt3.
Lcad was deacetylated in wildtype mice under fasted conditions and by
Sirt3 in vitro and in vivo; and hyperacetylation of Lcad reduced its
enzymatic activity. Mice lacking Sirt3 exhibited hallmarks of fatty acid
oxidation disorders during fasting, including reduced ATP levels and
intolerance to cold exposure. Hirschey et al. (2010) concluded that
their findings identified acetylation as a novel regulatory mechanism
for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and demonstrated that Sirt3
modulates mitochondrial intermediary metabolism and fatty acid use
during fasting.

Someya et al. (2010) demonstrated that caloric restriction in wildtype
mice reduced oxidative DNA damage in multiple tissues and prevented
age-related hearing loss. In contrast, these phenotypes were not
modified by caloric restriction in Sirt3-null mice. Cellular studies
indicated that SIRT3 directly deacetylated and thus activated isocitrate
dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2; 147650), an enzyme that converts NADP+ to NADPH
in mitochondria. In response to caloric restriction, SIRT3 stimulated
IDH2 activity, leading to increased levels of NADPH and increased levels
of reduced glutathione, which is the major antioxidant defense system in
the cell. Overexpression of SIRT3 and/or IDH2 increased NADPH levels and
protected cultured cells from oxidative stress. The findings provided
conclusive evidence that caloric-mediated reduction of oxidative damage
and prevention of a common age-related phenotype require a member of the
sirtuin family in mammals.

607410	TITLE *607410 DIENCEPHALON/MESENCEPHALON HOMEOBOX 1; DMBX1
;;ORTHODENTICLE, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 3; OTX3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

OTX3 is a homeodomain transcription factor that is structurally and
functionally related to OTX1 (600036) and OTX2 (600037), both of which
are critical in brain morphogenesis.

CLONING

Zhang et al. (2002) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding Otx3 from a mouse
pancreatic beta cell (MIN6) cDNA library. The deduced 376-amino acid
protein shares 65% overall sequence identity with Otx1 and Otx2,
including a conserved lysine at amino acid 50 in the homeodomain.
However, it lacks the so-called OTX tail, a conserved motif of about 20
amino acids found in other Otx members. Zhang et al. (2002) cloned the
full-length human OTX3 homolog from a fetal brain cDNA library. The
deduced human protein shares approximately 94% sequence identity with
the mouse protein. Northern blot analysis of rat tissues detected a
single abundant transcript of 4.3 kb only in MIN6 and adult cerebellum.
RT-PCR with Otx3-specific primers demonstrated expression in adult
pancreatic islets. The Otx3 transcript was detected from 10.5 to 13.5
days postcoitum in mouse embryos, overlapping the temporal expression
pattern of Otx1 and Otx2. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated
that Otx3 expression is craniocaudally more restricted than that of Otx1
or Otx2, showing the most intense signal at the midbrain-hindbrain
boundary.

GENE FUNCTION

Using electophoretic mobility shift assays, Zhang et al. (2002) showed
that Otx3 specifically binds to the consensus sequence TAATCCC and thus
acts as a transcription factor. Cotransfection experiments with Otx3 and
Otx2 showed that Otx3 significantly suppressed Otx2-induced
transcription activity, suggesting that Otx3 functions as a
transcription repressor of Otx2 by acting competitively on the target
sequence.

ANIMAL MODEL

Ohtoshi and Behringer (2004) developed mice carrying Dmbx1 mutant
alleles. Some homozygous mutant mice died during the neonatal period,
while others survived to adulthood and were fertile, although their
growth was impaired. Both heterozygous and homozygous mutant offspring
from Dmbx1 homozygous mutant females exhibited a low survival rate and
poor growth, and even wildtype pups fostered onto Dmbx1 homozygous
mutant females grew poorly. The neonatal mortality and growth defect
were likely caused by an impaired milk ejection reflex in homozygous
mutant dams. Heterozygous mutant mice showed abnormal Dmbx1 expression
in the nervous system, suggesting abnormal brain development.

Fujimoto et al. (2007) found that Dmbx1 -/- mice exhibited severe
leanness associated with hypophagia and hyperactivity. Isolation of a
Dmbx1 -/- mouse from its cohabitants induced self-starvation, sometimes
leading to death, features similar to those of anorexia nervosa (see
606788) in humans. The findings suggested that Dmbx1 is involved in the
actions of Agrp (602311) in regulating energy homeostasis and behavior.

602250	TITLE *602250 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR RECEPTOR SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 9; TNFRSF9
;;INDUCED BY LYMPHOCYTE ACTIVATION; ILA;;
CD137;;
Ly63, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF;;
4-1BB, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ILA is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family (see
191190). Members of this receptor family and their structurally related
ligands are important regulators of a wide variety of physiologic
processes and play an important role in the regulation of immune
responses. ILA is expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes and
monocytes.

CLONING

Schwarz et al. (1993) isolated the ILA gene from a library constructed
from activated human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) type 1-transformed
human T-lymphocytes. The gene, also called CD137, encodes a 255-amino
acid protein with 3 cysteine-rich motifs in the extracellular domain
(characteristic of this receptor family), a transmembrane region, and a
short N-terminal cytoplasmic portion containing potential
phosphorylation sites. Its mouse homolog, 4-1BB, was cloned by Kwon and
Weissman (1989) in screens for receptors expressed on activated
lymphocytes and has 59.6% amino acid identity to ILA. Expression in
primary cells is strictly activation dependent. Constitutive expression
was detected only in oncogenically or virally transformed cells.

Alderson et al. (1994) cloned TNFRSF9 and its ligand, TNFSF9 (606182).

GENE FUNCTION

Schwarz et al. (1996) reported that ILA inhibits proliferation of
activated T lymphocytes and induces programmed cell death.

Loo et al. (1997) reported that, unlike its mouse counterpart, human
4-1BB binds only to its ligand, TNFSF9, and not to extracellular matrix
proteins such as laminin (see 150240). The authors attributed this
species distinction to sequence differences in the N-terminal
laminin-homologous domain of human 4-1BB.

Munks et al. (2004) found that stimulation of 4-1BB in mice at the time
of a DNA prime, poxvirus vaccine, increased the number of functional
memory CD8 (see 186910) T cells that responded, while stimulation of
OX40 (TNFRSF4; 600315) increased the number of antigen-specific CD4
(186940) T cells that responded. Stimulating both of these TNFRs
enhanced the CD8 response more than stimulating 4-1BB alone. Munks et
al. (2004) suggested that stimulating these receptors can improve the
response to a powerful virus vector and may be useful in vaccine
development.

MAPPING

Schwarz et al. (1997) localized the ILA gene to chromosome 1p36 by
somatic cell hybrid analysis. This chromosomal region harbors several
other members of this receptor family (e.g., TNFR2, 191191; CD30,
153243; OX40; and TAMP/Apo3, 603366) and is associated with deletions
and rearrangements in several malignancies, including neuroblastomas,
myelodysplastic syndrome, and refractory acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.

ANIMAL MODEL

Sun et al. (2002) reported that treatment with 2A, an agonistic
monoclonal antibody to CD137, blocked lymphadenopathy and spontaneous
autoimmune disease in Fas (TNFRSF6; 134637)-deficient mice (a model for
human systemic lupus erythematosus, 152700), ultimately leading to their
prolonged survival. Specifically, 2A treatment rapidly augmented
interferon-gamma (IFNG; 147570) production and induced the depletion of
autoreactive B cells and abnormal double-negative T cells, possibly by
increasing their apoptosis through Fas- and TNF receptor-independent
mechanisms. Sun et al. (2002) concluded that agonistic monoclonal
antibodies specific for costimulatory molecules could be used as novel
therapeutic agents to deplete autoreactive lymphocytes and block
autoimmune disease progression.

Collagen type II (120140)-induced arthritis is a Cd4-positive T
cell-dependent chronic inflammation in susceptible DBA/1 mice and
represents a model for human rheumatoid arthritis (180300). Seo et al.
(2004) found that an agonistic anti-4-1BB monoclonal antibody (Mab)
inhibited development of collagen type II-induced arthritis, as well as
established disease, in DBA/1 mice. The Mab suppressed both serum
antibody to collagen type II and Cd4-positive T-cell recall responses to
the antigen. Mab treatment induced massive, antigen-dependent clonal
expansion of Ifng-producing Cd11c (ITGAX; 151510)-positive/Cd8-positive
T cells and the accumulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (INDO;
147435) in Cd11b (ITGM; 120980)-positive monocytes and Cd11c-positive
dendritic cells. Treatment with anti-Ifng or an inhibitor of Indo
reversed the beneficial effects. Seo et al. (2004) concluded that
expansion of a new population of Cd11c-positive/Cd8-positive T cells
producing large amounts of Ifng mediated the suppression of
collagen-induced arthritis through an Indo-dependent mechanism.

Zhang et al. (2007) showed that injection of anti-CD137 into mice 1 day
before infection with influenza virus resulted in 80% mortality, whereas
administration of the antibody 1 day after infection resulted in 100%
survival. Similar findings in terms of antibody administration before
and after infection were obtained with a lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus model. Zhang et al. (2007) concluded that the timing of anti-CD137
administration profoundly alters the nature of antiviral immunity.

McNamara et al. (2008) noted that agonistic anti-4-1bb antibodies
enhance tumor immunity in mice. Aptamers are oligonucleotide-based
ligands with specificity and avidity comparable to, or exceeding, that
of antibodies. McNamara et al. (2008) showed that multivalent
configurations of a 4-1bb-binding aptamer costimulated T-cell activation
in vitro and mediated tumor rejection in mice. They concluded that
aptamers may be superior to antibodies in therapeutic manipulation of
the immune system, since they have a simpler manufacturing and approval
process and are less likely to induce autoimmunity.

Wang et al. (2010) found that injection of anti-CD137, a mimic of
CD137L, in hepatitis B virus (HBV; see 610424)-transgenic mice promoted
liver disease progression from hepatitis to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and,
ultimately, liver cancer. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated an
increase in the percentage of Cd8-positive intrahepatic lymphocytes in
HBV-transgenic mice treated with anti-CD137. Depletion of Cd8-positive,
Cd4-positive, or natural killer cells showed that Cd8-positive T cells,
which were not specific for HBV and produced Ifng, were the main
mediators of liver fibrosis induced by CD137 stimulation. Ifng, in turn,
induced macrophage production of other fibrosis-promoting cytokines and
chemokines, including Tnf (191160), Il6 (147620), and Mcp1 (CCL2;
158105). Wang et al. (2010) proposed that sustained CD137 stimulation is
a contributing factor for liver immunopathology in chronic HBV
infection, suggesting that a common defense pathway against viral
infection also causes chronic hepatic diseases.

615094	TITLE *615094 PROSPERO-RELATED HOMEOBOX 2; PROX2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Proteins related to Drosophila prospero, like PROX2, contain an atypical
DNA-binding homeodomain. PROX2 functions as a transcriptional activator
(Nishijima and Ohtoshi, 2006).

CLONING

Nishijima and Ohtoshi (2006) cloned mouse Prox2 from postnatal mouse
retina RNA. The deduced 593-amino acid protein contains an N-terminal
domain conserved in prospero proteins, designated PD1, followed by a
C-terminal homeodomain and a second conserved prospero domain, PD2.
Database analysis revealed orthologs of Prox2 in rat and human. Northern
blot analysis of 12 mouse tissues detected transcripts of about 1.8 and
2.5 kb in testis only. RNA dot blot analysis and in situ hybridization
revealed Prox2 expression in whole mouse embryo, in embryonic cranial
ganglia, and in neonatal retina.

Pistocchi et al. (2008) found that zebrafish Prox2 was expressed
throughout development, including the zygote, and in all adult organs
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Using reporter gene assays, Nishijima and Ohtoshi (2006) found that
mouse Prox2 was a transcriptional activator. Truncation analysis showed
that the N-terminal 130 amino acids of Prox2, including PD1, were
sufficient for transcriptional activation.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Nishijima and Ohtoshi (2006) mapped the mouse and
human PROX2 genes to regions of conserved synteny on chromosomes 12 and
14, respectively.

Hartz (2013) mapped the PROX2 gene to chromosome 14q24.3 based on an
alignment of the PROX2 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK094068) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

ANIMAL MODEL

Nishijima and Ohtoshi (2006) obtained Prox2 -/- mice at the expected
mendelian ratio. Prox2 -/- mice grew and developed normally, and both
male and female Prox2 -/- mice were fertile.

NONCODING NUCLEAR-ENRICHED ABUNDANT TRANSCRIPT 2; NEAT2;;

MALAT1-ASSOCIATED SMALL CYTOPLASMIC RNA, INCLUDED; MASCRNA, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

The Alpha gene was identified by James et al. (1994) and by Guru et al.
(1997). It is unusual in that it is very AT-rich, transcribed in an
intronless fashion, and contains no ORF of significant length.

By subtractive hybridization to identify genes upregulated in aggressive
nonsmall cell lung cancer, followed by 5-prime and 3-prime RACE, Ji et
al. (2003) cloned 2 splice variants of MALAT1. The transcripts have
putative open reading frames for peptides of about 50 amino acids, but
no translation start sites have Kozak sequences. No MALAT1 protein was
synthesized in an in vitro translation system. Northern blot analysis
detected a MALAT1 transcript in human lung carcinoma cell lines.
Real-time RT-PCR detected variable MALAT1 expression in normal tissues,
with highest expression in pancreas and lung. MALAT1 homologs in several
mammalian EST databases showed a high degree of sequence conservation.

Using expression arrays to identify polyadenylated RNAs displaying
nuclear enrichment in human cell lines, Hutchinson et al. (2007)
identified XIST (314670), NEAT1 (NCRNA00084; 612769), and MALAT1, which
they called NEAT2. Like NEAT1, NEAT2 is a large, infrequently spliced
noncoding RNA, but it shares no sequence identity with NEAT1. Northern
blot analysis detected broad expression of a NEAT2 transcript of over 6
kb, with highest expression in ovary, prostate, and colon. Hutchinson et
al. (2007) also cloned mouse Neat2, and Northern blot analysis detected
a broadly expressed transcript of about 7 kb in mouse tissues. Neat2
orthologs were conserved within multiple mammalian species, but not in
nonmammalian species. RNA FISH analysis confirmed nuclear enrichment of
NEAT1 and NEAT2 in human and mouse cell lines. Both proteins localized
with SC35 (SFRS2; 600813) at nuclear speckles, although NEAT2 was more
centrally located and NEAT1 more peripherally located.

Wilusz et al. (2008) identified mascRNA, a highly conserved
61-nucleotide RNA that originates from the 3-prime end of the human
MALAT1 transcript. The mascRNA transcript was predicted to fold into a
tRNA-like cloverleaf. It terminates in a CCA motif, which is not encoded
in the genome and is a hallmark of the 3-prime ends of tRNAs and similar
structures. However, the predicted anticodon loop of mascRNA is poorly
conserved, and mascRNA was not aminoacylated in HeLa cells. Like the
mature 7-kb MALAT1 transcript, Northern blot analysis detected mascRNA
expression in all human tissues and cell lines examined. Northern blot
analysis of fractionated mouse cells showed that Malat1 localized to the
nucleus, whereas mascRNA localized to the cytoplasm in mouse cells and
HeLa cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Ji et al. (2003) found that MALAT1 was one of several genes whose
expression was increased in nonsmall cell lung cancers prior to
metastasizing. MALAT1 expression was associated with cancers in a stage-
and histology-specific manner. Ji et al. (2003) suggested that MALAT1
expression may be a prognostic parameter for patient survival in stage I
nonsmall cell lung cancer.

Wilusz et al. (2008) found that RNase P (see 606116) cleaved the nascent
MALAT1 transcript downstream of a genomically encoded poly(A)-rich tract
to simultaneously generate the poly(A) 3-prime end of the mature MALAT1
transcript and the 5-prime end of mascRNA. RNase Z (see ELAC2; 605367)
processed the 3-prime end of mascRNA, followed by the addition of the
CCA motif. Wilusz et al. (2008) also found that the nuclear MALAT1
transcript was stabilized by U-rich motifs, whereas cytoplasmic mascRNA
had a relatively short half-life.

MAPPING

The Alpha gene maps near the multiple endocrine neoplasia type-1 locus
(MEN1; 131100) on chromosome 11q13, a region implicated in chromosomal
abnormalities of various tumors (James et al., 1994; Guru et al., 1997;
van Asseldonk et al., 2000).

Hutchinson et al. (2007) determined that the MALAT1 and NCRNA00084 genes
are less than 70 kb apart on chromosome 11q13.1. They mapped the mouse
Malat1 gene to a region of chromosome 19A that shares homology of
synteny with human chromosome 11q13.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Davis et al. (2003) cloned an Alpha/TFEB (600744) fusion gene in renal
tumors harboring a t(6;11)(p21.1;q13) translocation. They found that the
Alpha gene was rearranged with the first intron of TFEB, just upstream
of TFEB's initiation ATG, preserving the entire TFEB coding sequence.

Kuiper et al. (2003) collected 3 cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC;
605074) from patients 14 to 42 years of age, wherein a t(6;11)(p21;q13)
translocation was the sole cytogenetic abnormality. Molecular analysis
revealed fusion of the TFEB gene on chromosome 6 to the Alpha gene on
chromosome 11. The Alpha/TFEB fusion gene linked all coding exons of the
TFEB gene to 5-prime upstream regulatory sequences of the Alpha gene.
Alpha/TFEB mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in primary tumor
cells as compared with wildtype TFEB mRNA levels in normal kidney
samples, resulting in a dramatic upregulation of TFEB protein levels.
The TFEB protein encoded by the Alpha/TFEB fusion gene was efficiently
targeted to the nucleus. Kuiper et al. (2003) speculated that this
resulted in severely unbalanced nuclear ratios of MITF (156845)/TFE
subfamily members and that this imbalance may lead to changes in the
expression of downstream target genes, ultimately resulting in the
development of RCC.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NBPF11 is a member of the NBPF gene family, which consists of 22 genes
and pseudogenes that arose by gene duplication. NBPF genes contain
numerous low-copy repetitive elements and show high intergenic and
intragenic sequence identity in coding and noncoding regions (Vandepoele
et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to NBPF1 (610501),
Vandepoele et al. (2005) identified NBPF11. EST database analysis
revealed NBPF11 expression in a variety of tissues.

GENE STRUCTURE

Vandepoele et al. (2005) determined that the NBPF11 gene contains 20
coding exons, many of which result from internal duplication.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis and FISH, Vandepoele et al. (2005) mapped
the NBPF11 gene to an NBPF gene cluster on chromosome 1q21.1.

601568	TITLE *601568 ADDUCIN 3; ADD3
;;ADDUCIN, GAMMA;;
ADDUCIN-LIKE; ADDL
ADD3/NUP98 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

From a human fetal-brain cDNA library, Katagiri et al. (1996) isolated a
novel human cDNA which they termed adducin-like 70. The predicted amino
acid sequence shows a high degree of homology to adducins alpha (102680)
and beta (102681). In human erythrocytes, adducin is a 200-kD
heterodimeric skeletal component of the cell membrane, where it promotes
the binding of spectrin to actin. This binding is regulated by
calcium/calmodulin (114180). Adducin also is phosphorylated by protein
kinase C. Adducin and its multiple isoforms represent a family of
proteins present in a variety of tissues and cultured cell lines,
including those from brain, kidney, and liver. The gene, symbolized here
ADDL, contains an open reading frame of 2,022 nucleotides encoding 674
amino acids. It shows 54%, 53%, and 59% identity in predicted amino acid
sequence with alpha and beta components of human adducin and rat adducin
63, respectively. Katagiri et al. (1996) stated that human adducin-like
70 is likely to play an important role in the skeletal organization of
the cell membrane. Northern blot analysis indicated ubiquitous
expression of this gene in adult human tissues.

In a comprehensive assay of gene expression, Gilligan et al. (1999)
showed the ubiquitous expression of alpha- and gamma-adducin, in
contrast to the restricted expression of beta-adducin. Beta-adducin was
expressed at high levels in brain and hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow
in humans, spleen in mice).

By RT-PCR of peripheral blood leukocyte RNA, Citterio et al. (1999)
identified a splice variant of ADD3 that includes exon 13. The deduced
706-amino acid protein contains 32 additional amino acids in its
C-terminal tail compared with the protein described by Katagiri et al.
(1996). RT-PCR detected both splice variants in kidney, brain, lung, and
heart.

GENE STRUCTURE

Citterio et al. (1999) determined that the ADD3 gene contains 14 coding
exons and spans over 20 kb.

MAPPING

Katagiri et al. (1996) localized the gene to chromosome 10q24.2-q24.3 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. By radiation hybrid analysis,
Citterio et al. (1999) mapped the ADD3 gene to chromosome 10q24.1-q24.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Lanzani et al. (2005) analyzed the ADD3 gene in 40 unrelated individuals
and identified a +386A-G polymorphism (dbSNP rs3731366) in intron 11.
The authors then genotyped 512 newly discovered and never-treated
hypertensive patients (see 145500) for IVS11+386A-G, but found no
association between the polymorphism and ambulatory blood pressure or
plasma levels of renin activity and endogenous ouabain. However,
carriers of a 460W polymorphism in the ADD1 gene (102680.0001) who also
carried the ADD3 G allele had an approximately 8 mm Hg greater increase
in blood pressure than those who carried the ADD3 A allele (p = 0.020 to
0.006, depending on the genetic model applied). Lanzani et al. (2005)
suggested that there were epistatic effects between the ADD1 and ADD3
loci affecting variation in blood pressure.

CYTOGENETICS

- ADD3/NUP98 Fusion Gene

Lahortiga et al. (2003) described a translocation t(10;11)(q25;p15) that
resulted in fusion of the ADD3 gene to the NUP98 gene (601021) on
chromosome 11p15 and development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

609863	TITLE *609863 TECTONIC FAMILY, MEMBER 1; TCTN1
;;TECTONIC 1; TECT1;;
TECTONIC
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Reiter and Skarnes (2006) identified mouse and human TCTN1, which they
named tectonic, after the Greek work for builder, due to its apparent
involvement in a diverse range of developmental processes. The deduced
mouse protein contains 593 amino acids and has an N-terminal signal
peptide. Database analysis indicated that tectonic is the founding
member of a family of evolutionarily conserved secreted and
transmembrane proteins that includes mouse and human TCTN2 (613846) and
TCTN3 (613847) and the single Drosophila tectonic homolog. In mouse
embryos, tectonic was expressed in regions that participate in hedgehog
(see SHH; 600725) signaling. It was first expressed during gastrulation
stages in the ventral node. At embryonic day 9.5, it was expressed in
the gut endoderm, limb buds, notochord, somites, neural tube, and
floorplate.

GENE STRUCTURE

Reiter and Skarnes (2006) determined that the mouse tectonic gene
contains 13 exons.

MAPPING

Gross (2011) mapped the TCTN1 gene to chromosome 12q24.11 based on an
alignment of the TCTN1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC040113) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

Reiter and Skarnes (2006) mapped the mouse tectonic gene to chromosome
5.

GENE FUNCTION

Reiter and Skarnes (2006) found that mouse tectonic modulated hedgehog
(see SHH; 600725) signaling downstream of smoothened (SMOH; 601500) and
Rab23 (606144) and was required for maximal hedgehog activation.

Using mass spectrometric analysis and immunoprecipitation studies of
mouse proteins and cultured murine cells, Garcia-Gonzalo et al. (2011)
showed that Tctn1 is part of a ciliopathy-associated protein complex and
interacts with several genes associated with ciliopathies, including
Mks1 (609883), Cc2d2a (612013), and Tctn2 (613846). The 2 strongest
interactors were Tctn2 and Tctn3 (613847), indicating that these 3
tectonic proteins are part of the same complex. TCTN1 also interacted
with B9d1 (614144) and Tmem216 (613277), Tmem67 (609884), and Cep290
(610142) under some conditions. In cultured ciliated cells, Tctn1
localized with these proteins to the transition zone between the ciliary
axoneme and the basal body, where it regulates ciliogenesis in a
tissue-dependent manner. Studies of fibroblasts derived from Tctn1-null
mice showed that the tectonic complex also controls ciliary membrane
composition, and is needed for proper ciliary localization of Adcy3
(600291), Pkd2 (173910), Smo (601500), and Arl13b (608922).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing,
Garcia-Gonzalo et al. (2011) identified a homozygous splice site
mutation in the TCTN1 gene (609863.0001) in 2 sisters, born of
consanguineous Bangladeshi parents, with Joubert syndrome-13 (JBTS13;
614173). Investigation of 4 families homozygous at the TCTN1 locus and
48 families with JBTS identified no additional mutations, suggesting
that TCTN1 mutations are a rare cause of Joubert syndrome.

ANIMAL MODEL

Reiter and Skarnes (2006) found that tectonic-null mice died between
embryonic days 13.5 and 16.5 and displayed holoprosencephaly. V3
interneurons were lost in tectonic mutants. Loss of ventral neural
markers in tectonic-null mice was accompanied by a ventral expansion of
genes normally restricted to more dorsal domains. Examination of
tectonic-Shh double mutants showed that tectonic could repress as well
as activate hedgehog signaling.

By studies in Tctn1-null mice, Garcia-Gonzalo et al. (2011) determined
that Tctn1 is required for ciliogenesis in a tissue-dependent manner.
Tctn1-null mice showed disruption of nodal flow, laterality defects, and
neural tube dorsalization. Basal bodies docked to the cellular plasma
membrane, but failed to extend axonemes. However, cilia were present in
the notochord, early gut epithelium, and mesenchymal cells surrounding
the neural tube and in the limb bud. Tctn1 -/- embryos developed an
extra preaxial digit on 1 or both hindlimbs. Although Shh expression was
normal, downstream signaling was disturbed, suggesting that Tctn1 is
required for cilium-dependent Shh signal transduction. Tctn2
(613846)-null and Cc2d2a (612013)-null mice showed a similar phenotype,
suggesting that these 3 genes share a common function affecting
ciliogenesis in a tissue-specific manner.

By homozygosity mapping followed by candidate gene sequencing in 2
sisters, born of consanguineous Bangladeshi parents, with Joubert

homozygous A-to-G transition in intron 1 of the TCTN1 gene, resulting in
a splice site mutation predicted to disrupt domains of the protein
required for its function. The mutation was not found in 96 controls or
in the 1000 Genomes Project data. Brain MRI showed cerebellar vermis
hypoplasia and the molar tooth sign, the characteristic radiographic
feature of JBTS. One girl also had bilateral frontotemporal pachygyria.
Ophthalmologic assessment and renal ultrasounds were normal at ages 7
years and 4 years, respectively.

604711	TITLE *604711 UBIQUITIN-LIKE 3; UBL3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Ubiquitin (191339) targets proteins for degradation by the 26S
proteasome (see 603146). In contrast, ubiquitin-like (UBL) proteins
(e.g., UBL1; 601912) may not be directly involved in protein
degradation, but appear to have a diverse range of cellular functions
(review by Hodges et al., 1998). Chadwick et al. (1999) identified the
Drosophila UBL3 gene. By searching an EST database using a Drosophila
UBL3 cDNA as the query, they identified a human UBL3 EST. Using the EST,
they isolated human keratinocyte stem cell cDNAs representing the
complete UBL3 coding sequence. The deduced 117-amino acid human UBL3
protein contains 2 potential N-glycosylation sites, a potential protein
kinase C phosphorylation site, and a potential C-terminal prenylation
site. It is relatively hydrophilic with no predicted transmembrane
domains. Human UBL3 shares 69% amino acid sequence identity with 1 form
of Drosophila UBL3 and 99% identity with mouse Ubl3, a cDNA of which
Chadwick et al. (1999) also isolated. Northern blot analysis of human
tissues detected 3.5- and 4.5-kb UBL3 transcripts in all tissues tested,
namely spleen, thymus, peripheral blood leukocytes, testis, ovary,
placenta, prostate, liver, pancreas, small intestine, colon, kidney,
heart, lung, brain, and skeletal muscle. Additional transcripts of 2.0
and 3.0 kb were found in testis. Chadwick et al. (1999) identified 3
polyadenylation signals that result in alternatively polyadenylated UBL3
transcripts.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid mapping, Chadwick et al. (1999) mapped the human
UBL3 gene to chromosome 13. They localized the UBL3 gene to 13q12-q13
using radiation hybrid mapping. Using FISH, Chadwick et al. (1999)
mapped the mouse Ubl3 gene to the telomeric end of chromosome 5 in band
G2-3, a region showing homology of synteny with human 13q.

DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for genes in a region of chromosome 11 associated with WAGR
syndrome (194072), Gawin et al. (1999) identified and cloned COMMD9,
which they designated clone 41188. Northern blot analysis detected
robust expression of a 1.5-kb transcript in all human tissues examined.
In mouse, expression was strong in all adult tissues and at all
embryonic stages examined.

MAPPING

By analysis of a PAC contig covering chromosome 11p14.1-p13, Gawin et
al. (1999) mapped the COMMD9 gene to chromosome 11p13, centromeric to
the 3K gene (FJX1; 612206) and telomeric to the TRAF6 gene (602355).

605551	TITLE *605551 NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE 1 (NEURONAL) ADAPTOR PROTEIN; NOS1AP
;;C-TERMINAL PDZ DOMAIN LIGAND OF NEURONAL NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE; CAPON
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the first 377 amino acids of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1;
163731) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Jaffrey et al. (1998)
isolated cDNAs encoding rat NOS1AP, which they called CAPON. One cDNA
encoded a deduced 125-amino acid protein and the other a 327-amino acid
protein. The N-terminal 145-amino acid stretch had residues suggestive
of a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain. Northern blot analysis
detected a predominant 7.5-kb transcript only in rat brain regions, with
no expression evident in adrenal, bladder, heart, kidney, lung, and
skeletal muscle. Marked regional variations occurred in brain, with
highest density in the cerebral cortex and medulla oblongata and lowest
levels in the hippocampus.

By PCR of a human fetal brain cDNA library, Xu et al. (2005) cloned 2
splice variants of NOS1AP, NOS1AP-L and NOS1AP-S. NOS1AP-L encodes the
deduced full-length, 501-amino acid protein, which contains an
N-terminal PTB domain and a C-terminal PDZ-binding domain. NOS1AP-S
encodes a deduced 211-amino acid protein with a unique 18-amino acid N
terminus and a C terminus containing the PDZ-binding domain. Western
blot analysis of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples revealed
major NOS1AP proteins with apparent molecular masses of 75 kD and 30 kD.
Other minor bands were detected and may represent variably
phosphorylated forms.

GENE STRUCTURE

Xu et al. (2005) determined that the NOS1AP gene contains 10 exons.
NOS1AP-S contains only exons 9 and 10 and has much longer 5-prime and
3-prime UTRs than NOS1AP-L.

MAPPING

Seki et al. (1997) mapped the NOS1AP gene, which they called KIAA0464,
to chromosome 1 by radiation hybrid analysis.

GENE FUNCTION

Jaffrey et al. (1998) showed that CAPON and NOS1 interacted in vivo and
in vitro and colocalized in rat brain. The 125-amino acid C-terminal
fragment of CAPON specifically interacted with NOS1 in a 2-hybrid
system. CAPON was found to compete with PSD95 (602887) for interaction
with NOS1, and overexpression of CAPON resulted in a loss of PSD95-NOS1
complexes in transfected cells. Jaffrey et al. (1998) concluded that
CAPON may influence NOS1 by regulating its ability to associate with
PSD95-NMDA receptor complexes. They proposed a model of PSD95-NOS1
regulation by CAPON in which NMDA receptors are coupled to NOS1 through
a PSD95 multimer; these interactions are mediated by PDZ domains. In
this complex, NOS1 is situated close to NMDA receptor-modulated calcium
influx. Binding of CAPON results in the reduction of NMDA
receptor-PSD95-NOS1 complexes, leading to a decreased access to NMDA
receptor-gated calcium influx and a catalytically inactive enzyme.

Chang et al. (2008) found that Capon was expressed in guinea pig heart
and interacted with Nos1 to accelerate cardiac repolarization by
inhibiting L-type calcium channels (see CACNA1C; 114205).

Carrel et al. (2009) found that overexpression of human NOS1AP-L in
cultured rat hippocampal neurons significantly reduced primary and
secondary dendrite numbers. Conversely, downregulation of Nos1ap-l via
short hairpin RNA increased primary and secondary dendrite numbers.
Mutation analysis showed that a middle region of NOS1AP played an
essential role in mediating NOS1AP-L action. Yeast 2-hybrid analysis of
rat brain lysates showed that this domain bound Cpe (114855), and the
interaction of NOS1AP-L with Cpe was confirmed by immunoprecipitation
analysis and protein pull-down assays. Knockdown of Cpe in hippocampal
neurons abrogated the effect of NOS1AP-L overexpression, although
knockdown of Cpe alone had little effect on dendrite branching.
Overexpression of human NOS1AP-S also inhibited dendrite branching, but
only when it was overexpressed in young cultures. NOS1AP-S also lacks
the CPE-binding domain of NOS1AP-L, suggesting that it inhibits dendrite
branching through a different mechanism.

606036	TITLE *606036 ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR 2; ARNT2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT; 126110) is a
member of a novel transcription factor family consisting of a conserved
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) structural motif contiguous with a PAS
domain. Members of this family include PER (see 602260), the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AHR; 600253), SIM1 (603128), and HIF1A (603348).

CLONING

Hirose et al. (1996) isolated a novel member of this family, which they
designated Arnt2, from a cDNA library of 11.5-day mouse embryos. The
deduced 712-amino acid protein contains a characteristic bHLH/PAS motif
in its N terminus and shares an overall sequence identity of 57% with
Arnt.

By screening randomly selected cDNAs corresponding to relatively long
transcripts from human brain, Nagase et al. (1997) identified ARNT2,
which they designated KIAA0307, encoding a 706-amino acid protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Hirose et al. (1996) determined that Arnt2 interacts with mouse AhR and
Sim as efficiently as Arnt and that the Arnt2-AhR complex recognizes and
specifically binds the xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) sequence. In
DNA transfection experiments, Arnt2 rescued XRE-driven reporter gene
activity in Arnt mutant cells. RNA blot analysis detected restricted
expression of Arnt2 in the brains and kidneys of adult mice, in contrast
to the ubiquitous expression of Arnt. In situ hybridization experiments
demonstrated expression of Arnt2 exclusively in the dorsal region of the
spinal cord and branchial arch-1, whereas Arnt expression was broadly
distributed in the ventral portion of the mesodermal and endodermal
tissues.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1997) mapped the ARNT2 gene
to chromosome 15. The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium
mapped the gene to 15q24 (TMAP stSG35499).

ANIMAL MODEL

To assess the role of ARNT2 in development and determine functional
overlap with ARNT, Keith et al. (2001) generated a targeted null
mutation of the murine Arnt2 locus. Arnt2 -/- embryos died perinatally
and exhibited impaired hypothalamic development, phenotypes previously
observed for a targeted mutation in the murine Sim1 gene and consistent
with the proposal by Michaud et al. (2000) that Arnt2 and Sim1 form an
essential heterodimer in vivo. In addition, cultured Arnt2 -/- neurons
displayed decreased hypoxic induction of HIF1A target genes,
demonstrating formally that ARNT2/HIF1A complexes regulate
oxygen-responsive genes. Finally, a strong genetic interaction between
Arnt and Arnt2 mutations was observed, indicating that either gene can
fulfill essential functions in a dose-dependent manner before embryonic
day 8.5. These results demonstrated that Arnt and Arnt2 have both unique
and overlapping essential functions in embryonic development.

605391	TITLE *605391 MULTIPLE INOSITOL POLYPHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE 1; MINPP1
;;MIPP, RAT, HOMOLOG OF;;
HIPER1, CHICKEN, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MINPP1 hydrolyzes the abundant metabolites inositol pentakisphosphate
and inositol hexakisphosphate and, like PTEN (601728), has the ability
to remove 3-phosphate from inositol phosphate substrates.

CLONING

In addition to inositol triphosphate, an important second messenger in
eukaryotic cells, there are a number of inositol polyphosphates, as well
as enzymes that affect their metabolism, that play a role in signaling
activity. The rat enzyme Mipp removes polyphosphate groups from a number
of inositol polyphosphates that contain at least 4 phosphates. The chick
gene HiPER1 (histidine phosphatase of the endoplasmic reticulum), a
homolog of Mipp, is expressed strongly in growth plate chondrocytes
transiting from proliferation to hypertrophy. By searching an EST
database with rat Mipp as the probe, Caffrey et al. (1999) identified a
cDNA encoding human MINPP1, which they called MIPP. Sequence analysis
predicted that the 487-amino acid MINPP1 protein is 84% identical to rat
Mipp and about 53% identical to chick HiPER1. The N terminus of MINPP1
contains an ER-targeting domain consisting of a relatively long
net-positive-charge (n) region, a hydrophobic core region, and a
recognition site for signal peptidases. Because of the
13-amino-acid-long n region, Caffrey et al. (1999) suggested that
translocation of MINPP1 to the ER may not require TRAM (605190), which
is needed for proteins with short (5 residues or less) n regions. MINPP1
catalytic activity appears to require sequences in the C terminus.
Western blot analysis demonstrated that MINPP1 is expressed as an
approximately 51-kD protein. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kb
MINPP1 transcript in all tissues tested except for peripheral blood
leukocytes; highest expression was detected in kidney, liver, and
placenta. In situ hybridization analysis showed that Minpp1 is expressed
much more intensely in hypertrophic than in proliferating or resting rat
chondrocytes.

By RT-PCR, RACE, and library screening, Chi et al. (1999) identified a
cDNA encoding MINPP1. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.6-kb MINPP1
transcript in HeLa cells and human chondrocytes. The authors noted that
the C-terminal ER-retention signal is conserved between chick, rat, and
human MINPP1 sequences. Functional analysis showed that mouse Minpp1
converts inositol tetrakisphosphate to inositol triphosphate.

MAPPING

Using FISH, radiation hybrid analysis, and YAC screening, Chi et al.
(1999) mapped the MINPP1 gene to 10q23, proximal to the tumor suppressor
PTEN (601728), in a region that is frequently mutated in cancer. By
radiation hybrid analysis, Chi et al. (1999) mapped the mouse Minpp1
gene to chromosome 19, also in proximity to Pten.

ANIMAL MODEL

Chi et al. (2000) used homologous recombination to generate
Minpp1-deficient mice. They observed that these mice were fertile,
lacked obvious defects, and had normal chondrocyte differentiation. An
increase in levels of cytosolic inositol polyphosphates was reversible
by the introduction of Minpp1 to the ER, showing that ER-based Minpp1
plays a role in the maintenance of steady-state levels of these
polyphosphates. In contrast, introduction into the cytosol of truncated
Minpp1 lacking the ER-targeting domain reduced the polyphosphates to
below their natural levels and was accompanied by slowed cellular
proliferation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which encodes a
dual-specificity phosphatase, have been found in up to 80% of patients
with Cowden syndrome, suggesting a role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of
follicular thyroid tumors. Although somatic intragenic mutations in
PTEN, which maps to 10q23.3, are rarely found in follicular tumors, loss
of heterozygosity (LOH) of markers within 10q22-q24 occurs in about 25%.
MINPP1, another phosphatase gene, had also been mapped to 10q23.3.
MINPP1 has the ability to remove 3-phosphate from inositol phosphate
substrates, a function that overlaps that of PTEN. Because of this
overlapping function with PTEN and the physical location of MINPP1 to a
region with frequent LOH in follicular thyroid tumors, Gimm et al.
(2001) considered it to be an excellent candidate gene that could
contribute to the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors. They
analyzed DNA from tumor and corresponding normal tissue from 23 patients
with follicular thyroid adenoma (FA) and 15 patients with follicular
thyroid carcinoma (FTC; 188470) for LOH or mutations at the MINPP1
locus. LOH was identified in 4 malignant and 3 benign tumors. One of
these FTCs with LOH was found to harbor a somatic ser41-to-leu mutation
(S41L; 605391.0001). They also found 2 germline sequence variants,
gln270 to arg (Q270R; 605391.0002) and IVS3+34T-A (605391.0003). Q270R
was found in only 1 patient with FA but not in patients with FTC or
normal controls. Interestingly, IVS3+34T-A was found in about 15% of FA
cases and normal controls but not in patients with FTC. The authors
concluded that these results suggest a role for MINPP1 in the
pathogenesis of at least a subset of malignant follicular thyroid
tumors, and that MINPP1 might act as a low penetrance predisposition
allele for FTC.

The primary nuclear transcripts of RNA polymerase II, some of which are

as heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (hnRNAs). At least 20 of these proteins,
designated A1 (34 kD) through U (120 kD), are present in abundance. In
the nucleus they are found in association with a specific set of
proteins to form ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) particles. In vertebrates,
the C proteins, C1 and C2, are major constituents of these particles.
The 2 are antigenically closely related phosphoproteins, which bind
tightly to RNA in vitro (Nakagawa et al., 1986).

CLONING

Nakagawa et al. (1986) cloned cDNA for the hnRNA C proteins. Genomic
blot analysis showed homologous DNA sequences across eukaryotes from
human to yeast, indicating that the hnRNA C proteins are members of a
conserved gene family. Burd et al. (1989) reported the complete primary
structure of the hnRNP proteins A2, B1, and C2; A1, C1, and L had
previously been sequenced. They suggested that the C1 and C2 proteins
are produced by alternative splicing of a single gene transcript.
Merrill et al. (1989) found that C1 and C2 differ by the presence of a
13-amino acid insert in C2, after either glycine-106 or serine-107 of
C1. The additional 13 amino acids account for the molecular mass
difference of C2 on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Otherwise C1
and C2 are identical; furthermore, the 3-prime and 5-prime untranslated
portions of the 2 mRNAs are identical (Swanson et al., 1987).

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HNRNPC
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP RH70234).

GENE FUNCTION

Locus control regions (LCRs) are regulatory DNA sequences located many
kilobases away from their cognate promoters. Mahajan et al. (2005) found
that an LCR-associated remodeling complex (LARC) purified from a human
erythroleukemia cell line exists as a single homogeneous complex of
hnRNP C1 and C2, the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex (see 600014),
and the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating (NURD; see 603526)/MECP1
(156535) complex.

Chen et al. (2006) purified the nuclear response element-binding protein
(REBiP) identified by Chen et al. (2003) in a patient with vitamin
D-dependent rickets type 2B (VDDR2B; 600785) and found a tryptic
fragment bearing 100% sequence identity with the human hnRNP C1 and C2
proteins (164020). Tryptic peptide sequencing followed by Western blot
analysis confirmed that cells from the VDDR2B patient overexpressed a
pair of anti-hnRNP C1/C2-reactive proteins of 39-40 kD, compatible with
the hnRNPC1 and the slightly larger hnRNPC2. When overexpressed in
vitamin D-responsive cells, cDNAs for both C1 and C2 inhibited VDR
(vitamin D receptor; 601769)-VDRE (vitamin D response element)-directed
transactivation by 23% and 42%, respectively (p less than 0.005 for
both). In contrast, transient expression of an hnRNP C1/C2 small
interfering RNA (siRNA) increased VDR transactivation by 39% (p less
than 0.005). Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed the presence
of REBiP in vitamin D-responsive human cells and indicated that the
normal pattern of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D-initiated cyclical movement
of the VDR on and off the VDRE is legislated by competitive, reciprocal
occupancy of the VDRE by hnRNP C1/C2. The temporal and reciprocal
pattern of VDR and hnRNP C1/C2 interaction with the VDRE was lost in
VDDR2B cells overexpressing the hnRNP C1/C2 REBiP. Chen et al. (2006)
stated that their work provided further evidence that hnRNPs are able to
influence gene transcription itself by acting as binding proteins for
hormone response elements and suggested that hnRNP C1/C2 may be a key
determinant of the temporal patterns of VDRE occupancy.

;;IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY RECEPTOR TRANSLOCATION-ASSOCIATED GENE
2; IRTA2;;
BXMAS1
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chromosomal abnormalities involving translocation breakpoints at
1q21-q23 are frequent in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see BCL9; 602597)
and multiple myeloma (MM; see 254500). By cloning the breakpoints of a
(1;14)(q21;q32) chromosomal translocation in the FR4 multiple myeloma
cell line, followed by exon trapping and screening a spleen cDNA
library, Hatzivassiliou et al. (2001) obtained cDNAs encoding 3 isoforms
of IRTA1 (605876) and 4 isoforms of IRTA2. The 3 major IRTA2 mRNA
isoforms (ITRA2A, ITRA2B, and ITRA2C) each have their own unique 3-prime
untranslated region, and the proteins they encode share a common amino
acid sequence until residue 560, including a signal peptide and 6
extracellular Ig-type domains. Sequence analysis predicted that IRTA2A
is a 759-amino acid secreted glycoprotein with 8 total extracellular
Ig-type domains followed by 13 unique, predominantly polar residues at
its C terminus. After the common 560 amino acids, IRTA2B has only 32
additional residues, whose hydrophobicity is compatible with its docking
to the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor. The 977-amino acid IRTA2C
protein shares the first 746 amino acids with IRTA2A. IRTA2C has a total
of 9 extracellular Ig-type domains with 8 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites; a 23-residue transmembrane region; and a
104-residue cytoplasmic domain with 3 consensus SH2-binding domains, all
of which exhibit features of ITIMs (immune-receptor tyrosine-based
inhibition motifs) and are encoded by separate exons. The fourth
isoform, IRTA2D, encodes a peptide of 152 amino acids. Northern blot
analysis detected 2.8-, 4.4-, 5.3-, and 0.6-kb IRTA2 transcripts in
lymph node, spleen, bone marrow, and small intestine, with a
preponderance of the IRTA2A isoform. In situ hybridization analysis
detected IRTA2 expression in tonsillar germinal center centrocytes, but
not in centroblasts, as well as in intraepithelial and interfollicular
regions.

Nakayama et al. (2001) independently cloned IRTA2, which they called
BXMAS1, by representational difference analysis of genes activated by
anti-IgM crosslinking of a human B-cell line. The deduced 977-amino acid
protein contains 8 ITIMs and 8 potential N-linked glycosylation sites.
Northern blot analysis detected a 6.7-kb transcript and a larger
transcript between 14- and 17-kb in B cells 24 to 36 hours after
activation. Northern blot analysis of tissues detected expression only
in spleen In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated expression of
IRTA2 in the mantle zone of tonsil tissue but not in germinal center
cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using FISH and Northern blot analysis, Hatzivassiliou et al. (2001)
determined that Burkitt lymphoma (BL; see 113970) cell lines with 1q21
abnormalities frequently overexpress the IRTA2 gene. However, in BL cell
lines with normal 1q21 chromosomes and in germinal center centroblasts,
from which BLs derive, IRTA2 expression was undetectable. Hatzivassiliou
et al. (2001) concluded that IRTA2 expression is frequently deregulated
in BLs with 1q21 chromosomal aberrations.

Orthopoxvirus MHC class I-like protein (OMCP) binds with high affinity
to NKG2D (KLRK1; 611817) on NK and T cells. Campbell et al. (2010)
showed that OMCP also bound to human and mouse monocytes and B cells,
which lack NKG2D. Using flow cytometric analysis, they demonstrated
binding of OMCP to mouse Fcrl5, which is highly expressed by B cells.
Campbell et al. (2010) suggested that FCRL5 and B lymphocytes are
involved in defense against zoonotic poxviruses.

GENE STRUCTURE

Nakayama et al. (2001) determined that the IRTA2 gene contains 16 exons
spanning 58 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hatzivassiliou et al. (2001) determined
that the IRTA1 and IRTA2 genes are separated by 21 kb on chromosome 1q21
and are transcribed in the same orientation. Furthermore, the IRTA1 and
IRTA2 genes form a contig on 1q21 with additional IRTA-related genes
(IRTA3, IRTA4, and IRTA5) and are telomeric to the MUC1 gene (158340)
and centromeric to the FCGR2B gene (604590).

611023	TITLE *611023 tRNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 5, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; TRMT5
;;TRM5;;
KIAA1393
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

tRNAs contain as many as 13 or 14 nucleotides that are modified
posttranscriptionally by enzymes that are highly specific for particular
nucleotides in the tRNA structure. TRMT5 methylates the N1 position of
guanosine-37 (G37) in selected tRNAs using S-adenosyl methionine (Brule
et al., 2004).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned TRMT5, which they called KIAA1393.
The deduced protein contains 500 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA detected
moderate to high expression of TRMT5 in all adult and fetal tissues
examined, with highest expression in ovary, followed by testis, spinal
cord, and liver. Moderate to high expression of TRMT5 was present in all
specific brain regions examined, with highest expression in corpus
callosum.

By searching databases for homologs of yeast Trm5, Brule et al. (2004)
identified human TRMT5, which they called TRM5. The predicted protein
contains 509 amino acids. Recombinant TRM5 had an apparent molecular
mass of 60.5 kD by SDS-PAGE. Bioinformatic analysis identified TRM5
homologs in eukaryotes and archaea; however, no significant homologies
were identified in prokaryotes, including the TrmD gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Brule et al. (2004) found that, unlike its bacterial counterpart, TrmD,
recombinant human TRM5 methylated G37 regardless of which nucleotide was
present at position 36. Human TRM5 also methylated inosine at position
37, unlike TrmD. TRM5 did not have an absolute requirement for magnesium
ions and appeared to function as a monomer.

GENE STRUCTURE

Brule et al. (2004) determined that the TRMT5 gene contains 5 exons and
spans 11 kb.

MAPPING

Nagase et al. (2000) mapped the TRMT5 gene to chromosome 14 by radiation
hybrid analysis. By genomic sequence analysis, Brule et al. (2004)
mapped the TRMT5 gene to chromosome 14q23.1.

611379	TITLE *611379 DISCO-INTERACTING PROTEIN 2, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, B; DIP2B
;;KIAA1463
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned DIP2B, which they designated
KIAA1463. The transcript contains a repetitive element in its 3-prime
UTR. RT-PCR ELISA detected moderate expression in adult brain and in all
specific adult brain regions examined. Expression was weaker in adult
liver, kidney, spleen, and ovary, and in fetal brain and liver, with
little to no expression in all other tissues examined.

Winnepenninckx et al. (2007) identified DIP2B as the gene associated
with fragile site FRA12A (136630) on chromosome 12. The predicted
1,576-amino acid DIP2B protein contains a DMAP1 (DNMAP1; 605077)-binding
domain and 2 AMP-binding domains. Northern blot analysis detected a 9-kb
transcript in most tissues examined. Within specific brain regions,
highest expression was in cerebral cortex and frontal and parietal
lobes.

GENE STRUCTURE

Winnepenninckx et al. (2007) determined that the DIP2B gene contains 38
exons.

MAPPING

By FISH and genomic sequence analysis, Winnepenninckx et al. (2007)
mapped the DIP2B gene to chromosome 12q13.12.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 patients with mental retardation associated with FRA12A,
Winnepenninckx et al. (2007) identified a CGG repeat expansion in the
5-prime untranslated region of the DIP2B gene (611379.0001).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION, FRA12A TYPE
DIP2B, CGG(n) EXPANSION

In 2 patients with mental retardation associated with FRA12A (136630),
Winnepenninckx et al. (2007) identified a polymorphic CGG repeat
expansion in the 5-prime untranslated region of the DIP2B gene. The
length of the expanded allele in the affected individuals was greater
than 1,050 to 1,150 basepairs, whereas unaffected FRA12A family carriers
had 650 to 860 basepairs. In 7 individuals with significant
neurocognitive problems reported in the literature, the average level of
FRA12A expression in lymphocytes was 43.7%, whereas that in unaffected
carrier individuals was 16.6%. The percentage of cytogenetic expression
of FRA12A was thus associated with the clinical phenotype. DIP2B mRNA
levels were halved in 2 subjects with FRA12A with mental retardation in
whom the repeat expansion was methylated. In 2 individuals without
mental retardation but with an expanded and methylated repeat, DIP2B
expression was reduced to approximately two-thirds of the values
observed in controls. A carrier of an unmethylated CGG repeat expansion
showed increased levels of DIP2B mRNA, which suggested that the repeat
elongation increases gene expression.

607519	TITLE *607519 POLY(ADP-RIBOSE) POLYMERASE 4; PARP4
;;ADP-RIBOSYLTRANSFERASE-LIKE 1; ADPRTL1;;
VAULT POLY(ADP-RIBOSE) POLYMERASE; VPARP;;
KIAA0177
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ADPRTL1 is 1 of several enzymes that catalyze the reversible addition of
multiple branched chains of ADP-ribose to target proteins. ADPRTL1 also
associates with large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes designated
'vaults' due to their unique structural characteristics.

CLONING

By randomly sequencing clones obtained from a myeloid cell line cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1996) cloned a partial cDNA of ADPRTL1, which
they designated KIAA0177. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous
expression, with highest levels detected in heart, lung, kidney, and
peripheral blood leukocytes.

Using an N-terminally truncated rat major vault protein (MVP; 605088) as
bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, followed by 5-prime RACE, Kickhoefer et
al. (1999) cloned ADPRTL1, which they designated VPARP, from a HeLa cell
cDNA library. The deduced 1,724-amino acid protein has a calculated
molecular mass of about 193 kD. ADPRTL1 has an N-terminal BRCA1 (113705)
C terminus (BRCT) domain, a PARP (ADPRT; 173870)-like catalytic domain,
a domain with 2 sequences similar to inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (see
147270), and a C-terminal MVP-interacting domain. The BRCT domain may be
involved in protein-protein interaction and is found in proteins
involved in cell cycle checkpoint DNA damage response. The putative
catalytic domain shares 29% identity with the catalytic subunit of PARP
and contains a conserved NAD-binding pocket. Northern blot analysis
revealed a 5.4-kb transcript in all tissues examined except brain.
Highest expression was detected in kidney, followed by spleen and liver.
Western blot analysis of fractionated HeLa cells detected a 193-kD
protein evenly distributed between nuclear, cytosolic, and microsomal
fractions. All of the ADPRTL1 protein in the microsomal fraction was
associated with the vault particle. Immunofluorescence localization of
ADPRTL1 in HeLa cells showed a punctate cytoplasmic distribution that
colocalized with MVP. There were also nuclear ADPRTL1 puncta that were
not associated with MVP and a portion of ADPRTL1 that colocalized with
beta-tubulin (191130) along mitotic spindles in dividing cells.

Still et al. (1999) obtained a partial ADPRTL1 clone and generated the
full-length cDNA by 5-prime RACE of a brain cDNA library and by
screening a thymus cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that the
N-terminal side of the catalytic domain is rich in glutamic acids, which
may serve as automodification sites. ADPRTL1 contains no bipartite
nuclear localization signal or N-terminal zinc finger domain required
for DNA binding. It has a potential uncleavable N-terminal signal
peptide, a central putative transmembrane domain, and a potential SH3
ligand-binding motif in its C-terminal region.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis and by in vitro binding assays with
recombinant proteins, Kickhoefer et al. (1999) confirmed direct
interaction between ADPRTL1 and MVP. The C-terminal domain, residues
1562 to 1724, was the smallest sequence of ADPRTL1 that could bind MVP.
The PARP-like catalytic domain, when expressed as a recombinant protein
in E. coli, showed ADP-ribosylase activity. Vault particles purified
from rat liver and incubated with radiolabeled NAD showed prominent
ADP-ribosylation of Mvp and some automodification of Adprtl1.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Still et al. (1999) mapped the ADPRTL1
gene centromeric to the ZNF198 gene (602221) on chromosome 13q11.

612942	TITLE *612942 RAS-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN RAB25; RAB25
;;RAB11C
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

RAB proteins, such as RAB25, are members of the RAS superfamily of small
GTPases that are involved in membrane trafficking. Members of the RAB11
subfamily, including RAB25, control the return of internalized
membrane-associated moieties to the cell surface (Caswell et al., 2007).

CLONING

Goldenring et al. (1993) cloned rabbit Rab25. Northern blot analysis
detected Rab25 throughout the rabbit gastrointestinal tract and in lung
and kidney. RAB25 was also detected in human colon cell lines.

By searching databases for RAS family members, followed by PCR, He et
al. (2002) cloned human RAB25. The deduced 217-amino acid protein
contains 4 highly conserved GTPase motifs and an unconventional
C-terminal motif (CCISL) rather than the more common geranylgeranylation
motif found in other RAB proteins. Northern blot analysis detected a
major transcript of about 1.35 kb that showed highest expression in
pancreas, followed by kidney, placenta, lung, prostate, small intestine,
and colon. Little to no expression was detected in other tissues
examined.

GENE FUNCTION

Goldenring et al. (1993) demonstrated that recombinant rabbit Rab25
bound GTP.

Cheng et al. (2004) found increased expression of RAB25 in a significant
proportion of ovarian and breast cancers compared with normal tissue.
RAB25 overexpression was particularly associated with stage III and IV
serous epithelial ovarian cancers. Transfection of RAB25 into several
tumor cell lines increased anchorage-dependent and -independent cell
proliferation, prevented apoptosis and anoikis, including that induced
by chemotherapy, and increased aggressiveness of cancer cells in nude
mice. RAB25-induced inhibition of apoptosis was associated with reduced
BAK (600516) and BAX (600040) expression and activation of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see PIK3CA; 171834) and AKT (see AKT1;
164730) pathway.

Using human and other mammalian cell lines, Caswell et al. (2007) showed
that human RAB25 promoted cell migration on 3-dimensional matrices and
functioned to retain the dimeric integrin alpha-5 (ITGA5; 135620)/beta-1
(ITGB1; 135630) at the tips of extending pseudopodia. RAB25-dependent
tumor cell invasion depended on fibronectin (FN1; 135600),
alpha-5/beta-1 integrin, and direct interaction of RAB25 with beta-1
integrin. Caswell et al. (2007) concluded that RAB25 enhances the
ability of tumor cells to invade fibronectin-containing extracellular
matrices.

GENE STRUCTURE

He et al. (2002) determined that the RAB25 gene contains 5 exons and
spans over 9.4 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, He et al. (2002) mapped the RAB25 gene to
chromosome 1q12-q21.2. Cheng et al. (2004) stated that the RAB25 gene
maps to chromosome 1q22.

;;FORMIN; FMN;;
LIMB DEFORMITY, MOUSE, HOMOLOG OF; LD
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Mutation at the mouse 'limb deformity' (ld) locus disrupts embryonic
pattern formation, resulting in a reduction and fusion of the distal
bones and digits of all limbs as well as variable incidence of renal
aplasia. Woychik et al. (1990) characterized the ld locus at the
molecular level and identified a complex gene which, because of its
presumed role in the formation of limbs and kidneys, was designated
formin.

Maas et al. (1991) described sequence and restriction-mapping data for a
human genomic clone that contained 2 major human-mouse homology regions.
They assigned the locus symbol LD to the human gene locus. They also
demonstrated 2 frequently occurring DNA polymorphisms at the LD locus
potentially useful for testing linkage to human syndromes that combine
limb and renal abnormalities.

Vogt et al. (1993) showed that the large and complex LD gene has the
capacity to generate a number of alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts
encoding nuclear protein isoforms called formins. They made polyclonal
antibodies to specific formin peptides and confirmed the authenticity of
the reactivity of the antibodies, using cell lines derived from mice
with molecularly defined mutations at the ld locus.

GENE FUNCTION

Zuniga et al. (1999) reported that the secreted bone morphogenetic
protein (BMP) antagonist gremlin (GREM1; 603054) relays the Sonic
hedgehog (SHH; 600725) signal from the polarizing region to the apical
ectodermal ridge. Mesenchymal gremlin expression is lost in limb buds of
mouse embryos homozygous for the ld mutation, which disrupts
establishment of the Shh/Fgf4 (164980) feedback loop. Grafting
gremlin-expressing cells into ld mutant limb buds rescued Fgf4
expression and restored the Shh/Fgf4 feedback loop. Analysis of Shh-null
mutant embryos revealed that Shh signaling is required for maintenance
of gremlin and Fmn1, the gene disrupted by the ld mutations. In
contrast, Fmn1, gremlin, and Fgf4 activation were independent of Shh
signaling. Zuniga et al. (1999) concluded that the study uncovered the
cascade by which the SHH signal is relayed from the posterior mesenchyme
to the apical ectodermal ridge and established that formin-dependent
activation of the BMP antagonist gremlin is sufficient to induce FGF4
and establish the SHH/FGF4 feedback loop.

Using a yeast 2-hybrid system to analyze alpha-catenin (see 116805)
binding partners, Kobielak et al. (2004) found direct interaction
between alpha-catenin and formin in a mouse skin expression library. In
addition, they found that formin nucleated the polymerization of
unbranched actin (see 102610) filaments in vitro and functioned in vivo
in alpha-catenin-dependent, radial actin cable formation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Wang et al. (1997) found that the mouse Fmn1 gene is very large,
spanning 400 kb and comprising at least 24 exons. Wang et al. (1997)
stated that some of the introns are very large, ranging more than 50 kb,
and may play a role in transcriptional regulation.

MAPPING

Maas et al. (1991) showed by a combination of mouse/human somatic cell
hybrid studies and in situ hybridization that the human LD gene is
located on 15q13-q14. Both this and the beta-2-microglobulin gene
(109700) are located on chromosome 2 in the mouse.

Richard et al. (1992) mapped the LD locus on chromosome 15, proximal to
the gene for cardiac muscle alpha-actin (ACTC; 102540).

Richard et al. (1994) mapped 149 chromosome 15 loci, including those for
18 genes, 60 cDNA-derived sequence-tagged sites (STS), and 69
microsatellites by PCR with respect to chromosome breakpoints in 3
somatic cell hybrids retaining all or part of chromosome 15 and to a
10-Mb YAC contig. Chromosome 15 was divided into 5 regions, yielding an
average resolution of more than 1 sequence tagged site per megabase.
They mapped the FMN gene to their region I: 15pter-q14.

ANIMAL MODEL

The murine 'limb deformity' (ld) locus is defined by several different
noncomplementing mutant alleles which share a characteristic limb
deformity and variably penetrant renal aplasia phenotype (Green, 1981;
Woychik et al., 1985; Woychik et al., 1990). The limb deformity is
marked by synostoses and syndactyly of all 4 limbs. The renal defect
consists of unilateral or bilateral renal aplasia.

The relationship between gremlin (GREM1; 603054) and Fmn1 is interesting
because of their proximity in the mouse genome. The Fmn1 transcript
comprises a large number of exons with the most 3-prime exon located
approximately 40 kb from the Grem1 open reading frame. Given the
apparently identical phenotype of ld mice to gremlin mutant mice and the
proximity of Fmn1 to Grem1, Khokha et al. (2003) tested whether gremlin
would complement ld. They found that gremlin fails to complement ld and
thus identified another ld allele. Although a complex interaction
between Fmn1 and gremlin is possible, Khokha et al. (2003) favored the
idea that the ld mutations affect gremlin expression directly and that
they lie in cis-regulatory elements for gremlin expression.

Zhou et al. (2009) generated Fmn1 pro/pro mice, which fail to produce
detectable Fmn1 proteins or any of the full-length Fmn1 splice variants.
They found that Fmn1 pro/pro exhibited only 4 digits per limb, a
deformed posterior metatarsal, phalangeal soft tissue fusion, and
absence of the fibula, with 100% penetrance on the FVB background and
66% penetrance on the 129/SvEv background. The Fmn1-mutant allele did
not genetically disrupt the characterized gremlin enhancer; indeed,
gremlin RNA expression was upregulated at the 35 somite stage of
development. The Fmn1 pro/pro mice demonstrated increased bone
morphogenetic protein (Bmp) activity, as evidenced by upregulation of
Msx1 (142983) and a decrease in Fgf4 (164980) within the apical
ectodermal ridge. Enhanced activity downstream of the Bmp receptor in
cells where Fmn1 was perturbed suggested a role for Fmn1 in repression
of Bmp signaling.

612157	TITLE *612157 SENTRIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE FAMILY, MEMBER 1; SENP1
SENP1/MESDC2 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The covalent modification of proteins by the small ubiquitin (UBB;
191339)-like protein SUMO (see SUMO1, 601912) is implicated in the
regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport, genomic stability, gene
transcription, and other processes. Sumoylation is catalyzed on target
lysine residues by a multienzyme process and is reversed by
desumoylating enzymes such as SENP1 (Yamaguchi et al., 2005).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologs of yeast Ulp1, followed by PCR
of a placenta cDNA library and 3-prime and 5-prime RACE, Gong et al.
(2000) cloned SENP1. The deduced 643-amino acid protein contains a
C-terminal domain that includes conserved histidine, aspartate, and
cysteine residues characteristic of cysteine proteases. SENP1 shares 21%
identity with yeast Ulp1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gong et al. (2000) determined that the SENP1 gene contains 18 exons and
spans 61 kb. Exon 3 contains the translational start codon.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gong et al. (2000) mapped the SENP1 gene
to chromosome 12q13.1.

GENE FUNCTION

Gong et al. (2000) showed that SENP1 removed the SUMO1 modification from
a sumoylated protein in transfected COS cells concomitant with the
accumulation of free SUMO1 monomers. It also removed SUMO2 (603042)
modifications, but not ubiquitin or NEDD8 (603171) modifications. SENP1
desumoylated the nuclear protein PML (102578), but not RanGAP1 (602362),
which resides on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex. Since
SENP1 was able to remove the SUMO1 modification from RanGAP1 in vitro,
Gong et al. (2000) concluded that the inability of SENP1 to desumoylate
RanGAP1 in vivo is due to the SENP1 nuclear localization.

Veltman et al. (2005) identified a patient with an infantile
sacrococcygeal teratoma and a constitutional t(12;15)(q13;q25)
chromosomal translocation, resulting in SENP1/MESDC2 (607783) fusion
genes. Both reciprocal SENP1/MESDC2 (SEME) and MESDC2/SENP1 (MESE)
fusion genes were transcribed in tumor-derived cells, and their open
reading frames encoded aberrant proteins. In contrast to wildtype
MESDC2, the translocation-associated SEME protein was no longer targeted
to the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a presumed loss-of-function as
a chaperone for the WNT coreceptors LRP5 (603506) and/or LRP6 (603507).
SUMO, a posttranslational modifier, plays an important role in several
cellular key processes and is cleaved from its substrates by wildtype
SENP1. In vitro studies revealed that translocation-associated MESE
proteins exhibited desumoylation capacities similar to those observed
for wildtype SENP1. Veltman et al. (2005) speculated that spatiotemporal
disturbances in desumoylating activities during critical stages of
embryonic development might be responsible for teratoma formation. The
constitutional t(12;15)(q13;q25) translocation suggested SENP1 and
MESDC2 as candidate genes for neonatal/infantile germ cell tumor
development.

Xu et al. (2008) found that the activities of SENP1, SENP2 (608261), and
Ulp1 were inhibited by oxidation. Peroxide induced the formation of an
intermolecular disulfide linkage in SENP1 via the active-site cysteines
at positions 603 and 613. This reversible modification, also observed in
yeast Ulp1 but not in SENP2, conferred a higher recovery of enzyme
activity following inhibition, as well as protection against further
irreversible oxidation and enzyme inhibition. In vivo formation of a
disulfide-linked SENP1 dimer was also detected in cultured cells in
response to oxidative stress. Experiments examining the crystal
structures of Ulp1 under increasing oxidation of a catalytic cysteine
revealed that Ulp1 was extremely sensitive to mild oxidation, even at
the atmospheric oxygen level. Xu et al. (2008) concluded that SENP1 may
act as a redox sensor and modulate protein desumoylation and cellular
responses to oxidative stress.

Using mechanistic studies in human cells, Yu et al. (2010) found that
SENP1 directly desumoylated GATA1 and thereby regulated GATA1
DNA-binding activity, GATA1-dependent EPOR (133171) expression, and
erythropoiesis. They concluded that SENP1 promotes GATA1 activation and
subsequent erythropoiesis by desumoylating GATA1.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yamaguchi et al. (2005) found that homozygous disruption of the Senp1
gene in mice via a retroviral insertional mutation caused embryonic
lethality between embryonic days 12.5 and 14.5 due to placental
abnormalities. Senp1 -/- embryos showed increased steady-state levels of
the sumoylated forms of a number of proteins, including Rangap1
(602362).

Yu et al. (2010) observed erythropoietic defects in fetal liver of Senp1
-/- mice. These defects were accompanied by reduced activity of Gata1
and reduced expression of Gata1 target genes due to accumulation of
sumoylated Gata1.

602091	TITLE *602091 LATENT TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR-BETA-BINDING PROTEIN 2; LTBP2
;;LTBP3, FORMERLY
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Moren et al. (1994) identified a novel latent transforming growth
factor-beta binding protein (see LTBP1; 150390), designated LTBP2.

Ali et al. (2009) characterized the LTBP2 gene. The 1,821-amino acid
protein consists of 20 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, 4
transforming growth factor-beta binding protein (TB)-like modules each
containing 8 cysteine residues, and an N-terminal signal peptide.
Sixteen of the EGF domains have calcium-binding motifs, and it had been
suggested that these adopt a rod-like molecular arrangement upon calcium
binding in order to present a specific surface for protein-protein
interactions. The cysteine-containing TB domains are unique features of
the LTBP-fibrillin superfamily, providing a degree of conformational
flexibility. LTBP2 has approximately 45% amino acid identity to LTBP1
and 25% identity to fibrillin-1 (FBN1; 134797) but unlike other LTBP
family members does not bind to latent forms of TGFB (190180). The
C-terminal region of LTBP2 competes with LTBP1 for specific binding to
the N-terminal region of FBN1, but not FBN2 (612570), in microfibrils.

By RT-PCR analysis, Narooie-Nejad et al. (2009) showed high LTBP2
expression in human eyes, including the trabecular meshwork and ciliary
processes that are thought to be relevant to the etiology of primary
congenital glaucoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of human eye showed
highest LTBP2 expression in the Descemet membrane and in the lens
capsule, with expression also in the nonpigmented epithelium of the
ciliary processes, trabecular meshwork, and transitional zone between
the sclera and corneal stroma. Expression was minimal in corneal stroma,
sclera, and iris.

GENE FAMILY

See Oklu and Hesketh (2000) for a review of the LTBP gene family.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ali et al. (2009) determined that the LTBP2 gene comprises 35 exons.

MAPPING

Moren et al. (1994) mapped the LTBP2 gene to chromosome 14q24 by
analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Primary Congenital Glaucoma 3D

In 4 consanguineous Pakistani families and in 8 Gypsy individuals with
primary congenital glaucoma (GLC3D; 613086), Ali et al. (2009)
identified homozygous nonsense mutations in the LTBP2 gene. The data
suggested that R299X (602091.0001) is the major primary congenital
glaucoma founder mutation in the Gypsy population.

In 2 consanguineous Iranian families with primary congenital glaucoma,
Narooie-Nejad et al. (2009) independently identified respective
homozygous 1-bp deletions (602091.0006-602091.0007).

In 12 Roma/Gypsy probands with congenital glaucoma, Azmanov et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for the R299X founder mutation. In an
additional patient, they identified compound heterozygosity for R299X
and a missense mutation in the CYP1B1 gene (R368H; 601771.0012).
However, the authors stated that their preliminary observations
suggested that CYP1B1/LTBP2 combinations in this and other patients were
of no clinical significance and that digenic inheritance was unlikely.

- Microspherophakia and/or Megalocornea, with Ectopia Lentis
and with or without Secondary Glaucoma

In 3 affected brothers from a consanguineous Indian family with isolated
microspherophakia and lens dislocation mapping to chromosome
14q24-q32.12 (251750), Kumar et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a
frameshift mutation in the LTBP2 gene (602091.0005). Primary congenital
glaucoma was excluded in the affected sibs, and none had any systemic
involvement.

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous Moroccan family with
megalocornea, microspherophakia, ectopia lentis, and secondary glaucoma
mapping to chromosome 14q23.3-q24.3, Desir et al. (2010) analyzed the
candidate gene LTBP2 and identified homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion
(602091.0008). In a similarly affected girl of Macedonian Gypsy origin,
they identified homozygosity for the R299X mutation in LTBP2, previously
identified in patients with primary congenital glaucoma, including
patients of European Gypsy origin.

In 8 affected individuals from 3 consanguineous families with
megalocornea and secondary glaucoma due to spherophakia and/or ectopia
lentis, Khan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion,
a nonsense mutation, and a missense mutation (602091.0009-602091.0011,
respectively).

- Weill-Marchesani Syndrome 3

In affected members of a large consanguineous Iranian family with
Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS3; 614819), Haji-Seyed-Javadi et al.
(2012) identified homozygosity for a missense mutation (V1177M;
602091.0012) in the LTBP2 gene.

ANIMAL MODEL

Shipley et al. (2000) targeted disruption of Ltbp2 in mice. All died
between embryonic day 3.5 and 6.5. Ali et al. (2009) found expression of
mouse Ltbp2 in connective tissue throughout the body and in particular
spinal cord, cardiac, and skeletal muscles as well as renal and
seminiferous tubules.

NOMENCLATURE

The symbol LTBP3 was formerly used for LTBP2 in the literature, but
LTBP3 is the official symbol for a different LTBP gene; see 602090.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
GLAUCOMA 3, PRIMARY CONGENITAL, D
MICROSPHEROPHAKIA AND/OR MEGALOCORNEA, WITH ECTOPIA LENTIS AND WITH
OR WITHOUT SECONDARY GLAUCOMA, INCLUDED
LTBP2, ARG299TER

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with congenital
glaucoma (GLC3D; 613086), Ali et al. (2009) identified homozygosity for
a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 895 in exon 4 of the LTBP2 gene,
resulting in an arg-to-ter substitution at codon 299 (R299X).

Ali et al. (2009) also identified this mutation in 8 of 15 CYP1B1
(601771)-negative Gypsy patients. The authors suggested that R299X is
the major founder mutation in the Gypsy population, accounting for more
than 50% of CYP1B1-negative and nearly 40% of all PCG cases in that
population.

In 12 Roma/Gypsy probands with congenital glaucoma, Azmanov et al.
(2011) identified homozygosity for the R299X founder mutation. In an
additional patient, they identified compound heterozygosity for R299X
and a missense mutation in the CYP1B1 gene (R368H; 601771.0012).
However, the authors stated that their preliminary observations
suggested that CYP1B1/LTBP2 combinations in this and other patients were
of no clinical significance and that digenic inheritance was unlikely.

In a 3-year-old girl of Macedonian Gypsy origin with megalocornea,
microspherophakia, and lens dislocation (251750), Desir et al. (2010)
identified homozygosity for the R299X mutation in the LTBP2 gene. Her
unaffected parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not
found in 100 Caucasian controls. When initially seen at 2 years of age,
she had normal eye pressures, and still had not developed glaucoma at 3
years of age.

a single-nucleotide deletion at position 412 in exon 1 of the LTBP2 gene
(412delG) resulting in a frameshift and leading to a putative stop codon
140 amino acids downstream (A138PfsX278).

LTBP2, 14-BP DEL, NT1243

In affected members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with congenital

a 14-bp deletion in exon 6 of the LTBP2 gene beginning at nucleotide
1243 (1243-1256del), resulting in frameshift and premature protein
termination (Glu415ArgfsTer596).

In 3 affected brothers from a consanguineous Indian family with
microspherophakia and lens dislocation (251750), Kumar et al. (2010)
identified homozygosity for a 1-bp insertion (5446insC) in exon 36 of

LTBP2, 1-BP DUP, 1796C

In a brother and 2 sisters from a consanguineous Moroccan family with
microspherophakia, megalocornea, lens dislocation, and secondary
glaucoma (251750), Desir et al. (2010) identified homozygosity for a
1-bp duplication (1796dupC) in exon 9 of the LTBP2 gene, causing a
frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination codon
(Val600GlyfsTer4). Their unaffected parents were heterozygous for the
mutation, which was not found in 100 Moroccan controls. Analysis of mRNA
from patient and control fibroblasts showed results consistent with
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The oldest sib, a 14-year-old boy,
displayed some marfanoid features (see Marfan syndrome, 154700)
including arm span greater than height, decreased upper-to-lower body
ratio, and high-arched palate.

LTBP2, 1-BP DEL, 1012T

In 2 male cousins, 2 years and 14 years old, from a consanguineous Saudi
Arabian family with megalocornea, lens dislocation, and secondary
glaucoma (251750), Khan et al. (2011) identified homozygosity for a 1-bp
deletion (1012delT) in exon 4 of the LTBP2 gene, causing a frameshift
predicted to result in a premature termination codon (Ser338ProfsTer2).
Their unaffected parents were all heterozygous for the mutation. The
older boy was tall and thin with a relatively high-arched palate, but
there were no other features to suggest Marfan syndrome (154700).

LTBP2, CYS1438TYR

In 2 brothers from a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family with
megalocornea, lens dislocation, and secondary glaucoma (251750), 1 of
whom also had microspherophakia, Khan et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a 4313G-A transition in exon 29 of the LTBP2 gene,
resulting in a cys1438-to-tyr (C1438Y) substitution at a conserved
residue. Their affected father and an affected paternal aunt were also
homozygous for the mutation, which was found in heterozygosity in the
boys' unaffected mother but was not present in 100 ethnically matched
controls.

.0012
WEILL-MARCHESANI SYNDROME 3
LTBP2, VAL1177MET

In an affected brother and sister and their affected cousin from a large
consanguineous Iranian family with Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS3;
614819), Haji-Seyed-Javadi et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for a
3529G-A transition in exon 24 of the LTBP2 gene, resulting in a
val1177-to-met (V1177M) substitution at a highly conserved residue
within the consensus calcium-binding sequence of the ninth
calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (131530)-like motif. The
mutation was also present in homozygosity in 3 more affected relatives
who displayed some features of Weill-Marchesani syndrome but had no
ocular abnormalities. Unaffected family members were either heterozygous
or homozygous for wildtype LTBP2, and the mutation was not found in 400
ethnically matched controls. Histologic examination of the extracellular
matrix (ECM) of skin fibroblasts from the proband revealed elastic
fibers that appeared clumped and fragmented compared to a control, and
electron micrography showed obvious disruption of the ECM in the
patient's skin, with notable reduction in abundance of collagen fibers
and increased space between adjacent fibers of the patient.
Haji-Seyed-Javadi et al. (2012) concluded that the V1177M mutation
disrupts microfibrils and causes changes in the substructure of the ECM.

608090	TITLE *608090 MLX-INTERACTING PROTEIN; MLXIP
;;MONDO FAMILY, MEMBER A; MONDOA;;
KIAA0867
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MONDOA forms heterodimers with MLX (602976) that can bind to and
activate transcription from CACGTG E boxes (Billin et al., 2000).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (1998) cloned MONDOA, which they designated
KIAA0867. The MONDOA transcript contains an Alu sequence within the
3-prime untranslated region. RT-PCR ELISA detected low to moderate
expression in most tissues examined, with highest expression in brain,
liver, skeletal muscle, and ovary, and little to no expression in
spleen.

Using human MLX as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen, Billin et al. (2000)
cloned mouse Mondoa from a whole embryo cDNA library. They cloned human
MONDOA by screening an erythroleukemia cell line cDNA library using
mouse Mondoa as probe. The deduced 919-amino acid protein contains a
central serine-threonine-proline (STP)-rich domain, a basic
helix-loop-helix domain, a zipper region, and a C-terminal MLX homology
domain. The N terminus of MONDOA is conserved among MONDO proteins of
other species. Northern blot analysis detected a major transcript of
about 9.0 kb and a minor transcript of about 5.5 kb in most human
tissues tested, with highest expression in skeletal muscle. In situ
hybridization of mouse embryos detected broad Mondoa expression, with
slightly elevated levels in the developing central nervous system.

GENE FUNCTION

Billin et al. (2000) characterized mouse Mondoa. Mondoa and Mlx
associated in vivo, and the dimer localized primarily to the cytoplasm
of mouse embryonic carcinoma cells. Treatment of cells with a nuclear
export inhibitor resulted in nuclear accumulation of Mondoa and Mlx,
demonstrating that the heterodimer shuttles between the cytoplasmic and
nuclear compartments. The Mondoa-Mlx complex bound to the CACGTG E box
in vitro and, when artificially targeted to the nucleus of mouse
fibroblasts, drove reporter gene expression from the E box. Coexpression
of MLX with truncation mutants of human MONDOA identified a
transcription activation domain within the central STP-rich region of
MONDOA. By mutation analysis, Billin et al. (2000) identified a
cytoplasmic localization signal within the N terminus of human MONDOA
that contributed to the cytoplasmic localization of the MONDOA-MLX
complex.

Eilers et al. (2002) determined that 2 regions within the MONDOA N
terminus contribute to the cytoplasmic localization of the MONDOA-MLX
complex by functioning as a CRM1 (602559)-dependent nuclear export
signal and as a binding site for 14-3-3 (see 601289) proteins,
respectively. The conserved C terminus of MONDOA and MLX contains a
cytoplasmic localization signal that directs cytoplasmic localization of
the monomers and a protein-protein interaction domain that mediates
interaction between MONDOA and MLX. Heterodimerization of MONDOA and
MLX, via either the leucine zipper or the C-terminal domain, inactivates
the C-terminal cytoplasmic localization signal. Inactivation of this
domain is necessary but not sufficient for nuclear accumulation of the
heterodimer.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1998) mapped the MLXIP gene
to chromosome 12. Billin et al. (2000) mapped the MLXIP gene to
chromosome 12q21.31 by in situ hybridization.

609146	TITLE *609146 RIC8, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A; RIC8A
;;SYNEMBRYN, C. ELEGANS, HOMOLOG OF, A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using G-alpha proteins (see GNAS; 139320) as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid
screen of a rat brain cDNA library, Tall et al. (2003) cloned Ric8a, a
homolog of C. elegans Ric8/synembryn. Database analysis identified 3
splice variants of human RIC8A that encode deduced proteins of 531, 537,
and 401 amino acids. The 531-amino acid RIC8A isoform shares 87%
identity with rat Ric8a. The 537-amino acid protein is identical to the
531-amino acid protein except for a 6-amino acid insertion, including a
polyproline sequence, at codon 355. The variant encoding the 401-amino
acid protein is derived from a 1-bp insertion at codon 395 of the
transcript encoding the 531-amino acid protein. The resultant frameshift
leads to a protein with 5 different C-terminal amino acids and a new
stop codon that forms a consensus CAAX box for geranylgeranyl
modification.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid analysis, Tall et al. (2003) found that rat Ric8a
interacted with GNAI1 (139310), GNAO (139311), GNAQ (600998), and weakly
with GNA13 (604406). No interaction was observed with GNAS. Ric8a
interacted preferentially with wildtype GNAI1 compared with its
GTPase-defective counterpart. In detergent extracts of rat brain
membranes, Ric8a interacted with GNAI1, GNAI2 (139360), GNAI3 (139370),
GNAQ, and GNA13, but not with GNAS or G protein beta subunits (see GNB1;
139380). Tall et al. (2003) found that Ric8a preferentially interacted
with nucleotide-free GNAI1. Ric8a stimulated the rate of binding between
a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog and GNAQ, and it stimulated the
steady-state GTPase activity of GNAQ. However, Ric8a did not interact
with preformed G protein heterotrimers or facilitate their nucleotide
exchange. Beta-gamma dimers appeared to compete with Ric8a for binding
to G-alpha proteins.

Afshar et al. (2004) determined that C. elegans Ric8 is required for
proper asymmetric division of 1-cell-stage embryos. Spindle severing
experiments demonstrated that Ric8 was required for the generation of
substantial pulling forces on astral microtubules. Ric8 physically
interacted with 2 nematode G-alpha subunits that act in a partially
redundant manner in 1-cell-stage embryos. Ric8 behaved as a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor for the G-alpha protein Goa1.

GENE STRUCTURE

Tall et al. (2003) determined that the RIC8A gene contains at least 7
exons.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RIC8A
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP WI-19967).

607089	TITLE *607089 CYCLIN D-TYPE-BINDING PROTEIN 1; CCNDBP1
;;GRAP2 CYCLIN-D-INTERACTING PROTEIN; GCIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In a yeast 2-hybrid screen with the C-terminal glu/pro-rich domain and
the SH3 domain (QC domain) of GRAP2 (604518) as bait, Xia et al. (2000)
cloned CCNDBP1, which they called GCIP, from a pretransformed human bone
marrow cDNA library. CCNDBP1 encodes a deduced 360-amino acid protein
with a calculated molecular mass of 40 kD. It is predicted to contain a
helix-loop-helix region without the basic DNA-binding domain, a central
acidic domain, and a leucine zipper motif. Northern blot analysis
detected a 1.3-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in heart, muscle, peripheral leukocytes, kidney, and brain.
RT-PCR revealed expression in all immune tissues, with relatively low
expression in bone marrow.

GENE FUNCTION

Xia et al. (2000) verified interaction between GCIP and the QC domain of
GRAP2 in yeast 2 hybrid assays, in in vitro binding assays, and by
Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates of cotransfected COS-7
cells. GST pull-down assays of cell lysates from several cell lines and
coimmunoprecipitation of cyclin D with GCIP from GCIP-transfected cells
showed that GCIP also associates with cyclin D (CCND1; 168461).
Overexpression of GCIP in COS-7 cells reduced the phosphorylation of the
retinoblastoma protein (RB1; 614041) by immunopurified cyclin D/CDK4
(123829) complexes. GCIP expression also reduced the transcriptional
activity of a cotransfected E2F1 (189971) reporter plasmid.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CCNDBP1
gene to chromosome 15 (TMAP WI16359).

610454	TITLE *610454 LEUCINE ZIPPER, PUTATIVE TUMOR SUPPRESSOR 2; LZTS2
;;KIAA1813;;
LAPSER1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the LZTS protein family, such as LZTS2, are involved in
transcription modulation and cell cycle control (Peng et al., 2011).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated adult brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2001) cloned LZTS2, which they designated
KIAA1813. The deduced protein contains 673 amino acids. RT-PCR ELISA
detected high expression in all adult and fetal tissues and specific
adult brain regions examined.

By searching databases for sequences similar to LZTS1 (606551), followed
by RT-PCR of prostate and testis mRNA, Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (2001)
cloned full-length LZTS2 cDNA, which they called LAPSER1. The deduced
protein contains 669 or 644 amino acids depending upon which of 2
possible starting sites is used and has a calculated molecular mass of
72.8 or 70.3 kD, respectively. Using RT-PCR analysis Cabeza-Arvelaiz et
al. (2001) identified alternatively spliced transcripts of 2.0, 1.7, and
1.35 kb. The 2.0-kb transcript contained the expected sequence from all
coding exons; transcripts of 1.7 kb and 1.35 kb lacked exon 4 and exon
3, respectively. Northern blot analysis using an LZTS2 exon 3 probe
detected a 2.8-kb transcript in all tissues examined, with highest
expression in prostate and testis, followed by spleen, small intestine,
uterus, and thymus, and lowest expression in peripheral blood
lymphocytes. A minor 3.8-kb transcript detected may contain additional
5-prime noncoding sequence. Northern blot analysis using the complete
cDNA detected multiple LZTS2 isoforms in normal tissues, consistent with
alternative splicing, and LZTS2 expression was absent in some prostate
cancer cell lines, while in other prostate cancer cells lines the ratio
of major to minor transcripts was significantly altered.

GENE FUNCTION

By transfection of LZTS2 into a variety of human and rat cancer cell
lines, Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (2001) showed that cancer cell lines
overexpressing LZTS2 exhibited reduced cell growth. The authors
concluded that LZTS2 may inhibit cell growth in a variety of cancer
cells and may function as a tumor suppressor.

Sudo and Maru (2008) showed that rat Lapser1 interacted with the
microtubule-severing heterodimer p80 (KATNB1; 602703)/p60 (KATNA1;
606696) katanin via a Lapser1-binding region in the p80 subunit. Lapser1
localized to the mother centriole independent of microtubules.
Overexpression of Lapser1 in mitotic cells inhibited katanin-mediated
microtubule release and delayed cytokinesis. Overexpression of Lapser1
in interphase cells was associated with enhanced acetylation of
microtubules and reduced cell migration. The Lapser1-katanin interaction
appeared to inhibit microtubule severing by reducing the affinity of
katanin heterodimers for microtubules. In primary rat neurons, Lapser1
colocalized with katanin in noncentrosomal compartments, including cell
bodies and branch points at the tips of axonal branches. Lapser1
overexpression in neurons resulted in defects in neurite outgrowth and
reduced axonal microtubule bundles.

GENE STRUCTURE

Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (2001) determined that the LZTS2 gene contains at
least 5 exons and spans at least 10.6 kb. There are 2 possible noncoding
sequences, exon 1a and 1b, that are represented in different ESTs as a
result of alternate splicing in the 5-prime region.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Cabeza-Arvelaiz et al. (2001) mapped the
LZTS2 gene to chromosome 10q24.3 between the PTEN (601728) and MXI1
(600020) genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Peng et al. (2011) obtained Lzts2 -/- mice at the expected mendelian
ratio. Lzts2 -/- mice showed obvious defects in kidney and urinary
tract, but not in any other tissue. Renal abnormalities in Lzts2 -/-
mice became apparent beginning at embryonic day 17.5, with ectopic
ureteric buds, renal/ureteral duplication, hydroureter/hydronephrosis,
and cystic dysplasia. Microscopic examination of Lzts2 -/- kidneys
revealed abnormal histologic organization, including tubular dilation,
cysts derived predominantly from collecting ducts, and lack of
glomerular structures. Lzts2 -/- kidneys and embryonic fibroblasts
showed altered subcellular localization of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806)
and elevated nuclear beta-catenin activity compared with wildtype mice.
Peng et al. (2011) concluded that LZTS2 is essential for
beta-catenin-mediated nephrogenesis.

609977	TITLE *609977 CELL DIVISION CYCLE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 8; CDCA8
;;DASRA B;;
BOREALIN
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CDCA8 is a component of a chromosomal passenger complex required for
stability of the bipolar mitotic spindle (Gassmann et al., 2004).

CLONING

By database analysis, Sampath et al. (2004) identified human CDCA8 as a
homolog of Xenopus Dasra B. The deduced 280-amino acid human protein,
which the authors called Dasra B, shares 42% and 23% identity with
Xenopus Dasra B and Dasra A, respectively. Immunofluorescence on
metaphase HeLa cells revealed Dasra B in a punctate distribution on
chromosomes, coincident with Aurora B (AURKB; 604970) staining.

Using a proteomic screen to identify proteins associated with
histone-depleted mitotic chromosomes, Gassmann et al. (2004) identified
CDCA8, which they called borealin. The deduced 280-amino acid protein
contains 2 putative nuclear localization signals. Secondary structure
predictions suggested borealin forms an N-terminal domain of 6 core
helices and a C-terminal domain of at least 2 strands and 3 helices.
Northern and Western blot analyses showed that borealin mRNA and protein
levels were significantly increased in mitosis. Immunolocalization of
borealin and Aurora B in HeLa cells revealed that the proteins
colocalized in a dynamic pattern throughout mitosis. Western blot
analysis detected borealin at an apparent molecular mass of 31 kD in
HeLa cell lysates.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunoprecipitation of HeLa cell lysates, Sampath et al. (2004) found
that Dasra B interacted with Aurora B and survivin (BIRC5; 603352).
Knockdown of Dasra B by small interfering RNA resulted in severe
chromosome misalignment at metaphase and accumulation of multiple
interphase nuclei. In Xenopus, Dasra B associated with survivin, Aurora
B, and Incenp (604411) in a chromosomal passenger complex required for
chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle formation.
Microtubule nucleation through the Dasra B-containing chromosomal
passenger complex was distinct from the Ran (601179)-GTP pathway of
chromatin-induced microtubule nucleation.

Using in vitro binding assays, Gassmann et al. (2004) showed that
recombinant human borealin interacted directly with in vitro translated
INCENP and survivin, but not with Aurora B or TD60 (RCC2; 609587).
Borealin also readily bound itself. Mutation analysis indicated that the
N-terminal domain of borealin, but not the C-terminal domain, interacted
with chromosomal passengers in vivo and could perturb their targeting to
centromeres but not to the spindle midzone. Knockdown of borealin in
HeLa cells by RNA interference resulted in delocalization of INCENP,
survivin, Aurora B, and TD60 and delayed mitotic progression.
Borealin-null cells showed kinetochore-spindle misattachments, increased
number of bipolar spindles associated with ectopic asters, and disrupted
chromosome partitioning at anaphase. Borealin did not increase the
kinase activity of Aurora B in the presence of INCENP and survivin, but
it was an Aurora B target protein.

Tsukahara et al. (2010) isolated a fission yeast cyclin B (123836)
mutant defective specifically in chromosome biorientation. Accordingly,
Tsukahara et al. (2010) identified Cdk1 (116940)-cyclin B-dependent
phosphorylation of survivin (603352). Preventing survivin
phosphorylation impaired centromere chromosomal passenger complex (CPC)
targeting as well as chromosome biorientation, whereas phosphomimetic
survivin suppressed the biorientation defect in the cyclin B mutant.
Survivin phosphorylation promoted direct binding with shugoshin (see
609168), which Tsukahara et al. (2010) defined as a conserved
centromeric adaptor of the CPC. In human cells, the phosphorylation of
borealin has a comparable role. Tsukahara et al. (2010) concluded that
this study resolved the conserved mechanisms of CPC targeting to
centromeres, highlighting a key role of Cdk1-cyclin B in chromosome
biorientation.

GENE STRUCTURE

Gassmann et al. (2004) determined that the CDCA8 gene contains 10 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Gassmann et al. (2004) mapped the CDCA8
gene to chromosome 1. They identified a possible pseudogene on
chromosome 7.

602351	TITLE *602351 CHEMOKINE-LIKE RECEPTOR 1; CMKLR1
;;CHEMR23;;
CHEMERIN RECEPTOR; CHEMERINR
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Chemokines, a family of small cytokines, recruit leukocytes during
inflammation and immune responses. Chemokine receptors, such as the
somatostatin receptors (see, e.g., 182451), belong to the family of
7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. Gantz et al. (1996) cloned
CMKLR1 by PCR of genomic DNA with degenerate primers based on the
conserved regions of somatostatin receptors 1-4. The predicted 371-amino
acid protein has 7 hydrophobic domains. The CMKLR1 gene has over 40%
nucleotide sequence homology to the somatostatin receptors 1-4 and over
50% to IL81R (146929) and FPR1 (136537). Northern blot analysis revealed
expression of multiple transcripts of different size in all tissues
examined.

While attempting to identify new neuropeptide receptors from a
neuroblastoma x glioma cell line by RT-PCR with primers based on
conserved regions of G protein-coupled neuropeptide receptors, Methner
et al. (1997) cloned a mouse Cmklr1 cDNA, which they designated Dez.
Using in situ hybridization, Methner et al. (1997) found that Dez is
differentially regulated during mouse development, with prominent
expression in developing osseous and cartilaginous tissues. Owman et al.
(1997) cloned the rat homolog, which they designated Cmkrl3, from a
liver cDNA library. Using in situ hybridization, they found that Cmkrl3
is widely expressed in the brain and periphery, particularly in
cardiovascular elements.

Using RT-PCR analysis, Wittamer et al. (2003) detected abundant CHEMR23
expression in immature dendritic cells (DCs), spleen, lymph node, and
lung, with lower levels in most other tissues examined. FACS analysis
confirmed CHEMR23 expression on DCs and macrophages.

GENE FUNCTION

By screening a cell line expressing CHEMR23, followed by reverse-phase
HPLC and mass spectrophotometric analysis, Wittamer et al. (2003)
identified the active product of TIG2 (RARRES2; 601973), which they
called chemerin, as the CHEMR23 ligand. Chemerin induced calcium
mobilization in and migration of macrophages and immature dendritic
cells in a CHEMR23-dependent manner. Monoclonal antibodies to CHEMR23
blocked chemerin-induced calcium mobilization in CHEMR23-expressing cell
lines.

By screening cells overexpressing CHEMR23 with a hemofiltrate peptide
library, followed by chromatographic purification, Meder et al. (2003)
independently identified a 134-amino acid circulating form of TIG2 as
the CHEMR23 ligand.

By generating a monoclonal antibody to CHEMR23 and screening circulating
leukocytes by FACS analysis, Zabel et al. (2005) demonstrated expression
of CHEMR23 on circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), but not on
myeloid DCs or other blood cells. In vitro assays identified chemerin in
serum, but not plasma, as a chemoattractant for CHEMR23-expressing
cells. Zabel et al. (2005) concluded that CHEMR23 may be a key mediator
of plasmacytoid DC recruitment from blood to tissue sites enriched in
chemerin.

By flow cytometric analysis, Vermi et al. (2005) demonstrated CHEMR23
expression in 40% of myeloid DCs and virtually all plasmacytoid DCs.
Transmigration of both DC populations across an endothelial cell layer
was dependent on chemerin and CHEMR23. Immunohistochemical analysis of
lymph nodes and tonsils showed CHEMR23 expression on DCs, but not on
Langerhans cells. Chemerin was expressed on the luminal side of high
endothelial venules. Chemerin was not expressed in normal skin, but it
was expressed on endothelial cells lining dermal blood vessels of lupus
erythematosus skin lesions in which plasmacytoid DCs were abundant.
Vermi et al. (2005) proposed that CHEMR23-chemerin interaction has a key
role in directing plasmacytoid DC traffic.

Resolvin E1 (RvE1), a bioactive oxygenated product of the essential
fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), is found in plasma during the
resolution phase of inflammation. Arita et al. (2005) determined the
complete structure of RvE1 and found that CHEMR23 mediates RvE1
signaling to attenuate NFKB (164011). Radioligand binding analysis
showed that chemerin and RvE1 bound the same region of CHEMR23. RvE1
inhibited Il12 p40 (IL12B; 161561) production induced from mouse splenic
DCs by Toxoplasma gondii antigen in a dose-dependent manner. Arita et
al. (2005) concluded that EPA, which is present in fish oils and has
beneficial effects on inflammatory disorders, and EPA-derived endogenous
agonists have antiinflammatory properties.

MAPPING

Gantz et al. (1996) mapped the CMKLR1 gene to chromosome 12q24.1 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization.

611327	TITLE *611327 DNAJ/HSP40 HOMOLOG, SUBFAMILY B, MEMBER 4; DNAJB4
;;HUMAN LIVER DNAJ-LIKE; HLJ1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

DNAJB4 belongs to the evolutionarily conserved DNAJ/HSP40 protein
family. For background information on the DNAJ family, see 608375.

CLONING

Using the G protein beta subunit (GNB1; 139380) as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a liver cDNA library, Hoe et al. (1998) cloned
DNAJB4, which they called HLJ1. The deduced 337-amino acid protein
contains an N-terminal J domain and a glycine and phenylalanine
(G/F)-rich region. It shares 84% sequence similarity with DNAJB1
(604572). Northern blot analysis detected high expression in skeletal
muscle, heart, and pancreas, and lower expression in brain, placenta,
and liver.

GENE FUNCTION

By Northern blot analysis, Hoe et al. (1998) demonstrated that the
expression of DNAJB4 increased following heat-shock treatment in human
liver and pancreas carcinoma cell lines.

MAPPING

Hartz (2007) mapped the DNAJB4 gene to chromosome 1p31.1 based on an
alignment of the DNAJB4 sequence (GenBank GENBANK U40992) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.1).

124095	TITLE *124095 CYTOPLASMIC TYROSINE KINASE; CSK
;;c-SRC TYROSINE KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Partanen et al. (1991) cloned a novel cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase
designated CSK. The CSK gene was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues
as 2 mRNA species of 2.6 and 3.4 kb, although in some tissues and cell
lines, only the larger mRNA was detected.

GENE FUNCTION

CSK downregulates tyrosine kinase activity of the SRC oncoprotein
(190090) through tyrosine phosphorylation of the SRC carboxy terminus.
Since cell transformation by SRC oncoproteins is caused by various
mechanisms that interfere with this phosphorylation, the CSK gene might
function as an antioncogene (Armstrong et al., 1992).

Cloutier and Veillette (1996) used the yeast 2-hybrid system to identify
proteins associated with CSK. They found that the Src homology-3 (SH3)
domain of CSK associates with a proline-rich region of PEP (600716), a
protein-tyrosine phosphatase expressed in hemopoietic cells. Cloutier
and Veillette (1996) showed that this association is highly specific and
speculated that PEP may be an effector and/or regulator of CSK in T
cells and other hemopoietic cells.

MAPPING

Armstrong et al. (1992) used in situ hybridization to map the CSK gene
to 15q23-q25.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Associations Pending Confirmation

CSK physically interacts with the intracellular phosphatase LYP (PTPN22;
600716) and can modify the activation state of downstream Src kinases,
such as LYN (165120), in lymphocytes. Manjarrez-Orduno et al. (2012)
identified an association of CSK with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE;
152700) and refined its location to the intronic polymorphism dbSNP
rs34933034 (odds ratio = 1.32; p = 1.04 x 10(-9)). The risk allele at
this SNP is associated with increased CSK expression and augments
inhibitory phosphorylation of LYN. In carriers of the risk allele, there
is increased B-cell receptor-mediated activation of mature B cells, as
well as higher concentrations of plasma IgM, relative to individuals in
the nonrisk haplotype. Moreover, the fraction of transitional B cells is
doubled in the cord blood of carriers of the risk allele, due to an
expansion of late transitional cells in a stage targeted by selection
mechanisms. Manjarrez-Orduno et al. (2012) concluded that their results
suggested that the LYP-CSK complex increases susceptibility to lupus at
multiple maturation and activation points in B cells.

ANIMAL MODEL

Lowry et al. (2002) found that actin stress fiber formation induced by G
proteins and G protein receptors was completely blocked in Csk-deficient
mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Reintroduction of Csk into Csk-deficient
cells restored G protein-induced actin stress fiber formation. Rescue
experiments with catalytic mutants of Csk demonstrated that Csk
catalytic activity was required for stress fiber formation. Lowry et al.
(2002) found that G-beta (see GNB1; 139380)/G-gamma (see GNG2; 606981)
dimers translocated Csk to the plasma membrane and directly increased
Csk kinase activity. They concluded that CSK plays a critical role in
mediating G protein signals in the reorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton.

602364	TITLE *602364 CATHEPSIN W; CTSW
DESCRIPTION Cathepsins are papain family cysteine proteases involved in a variety of
physiologic processes, such as proenzyme activation, enzyme
inactivation, antigen presentation, hormone maturation, tissue
remodeling, and bone matrix resorption. Cathepsins are glycoproteins and
contain an essential cysteine residue in their active site but differ in
some enzymatic properties, including substrate specificities and pH
stability. Cathepsins H (116820), L (116880), B (116810), and C (602365)
have ubiquitous expression and may have 'housekeeping' roles (Linnevers
et al. (1997)). In contrast, cathepsins S (116845) and W have
tissue-restricted expression and may have more specific functions.

Linnevers et al. (1997) identified a novel cathepsin in the GenBank
expressed sequence tag (EST) database. The cDNA clone encodes a
376-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted mass of 42 kD. Sequence
similarity with other thiol-dependent cathepsins at the amino acid level
is relatively low, in the range of 21 to 31%. Linnevers et al. (1997)
stated that all of the highly conserved residues of the papain-like
cysteine proteases are present in cathepsin W. In contrast to other
mammalian cathepsin sequences, cathepsin W contains a 21-amino acid
insertion between the active-site histidine and asparagine residues, and
an 8-amino acid C-terminal extension. Northern blot analysis detected
cathepsin W expression only in lymphatic tissues, with high expression
in cytotoxic (CD8+) T lymphocytes.

Wex et al. (1998) cloned the cathepsin W gene. The coding sequence is
contained within 10 exons spanning approximately 3.8 kb. At least 1
additional exon contains the 5-prime untranslated region. The authors
overexpressed cathepsin W in mammalian cells and unexpectedly localized
it within the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

By FISH, Wex et al. (1998) mapped the cathepsin W gene to 11q13.1.

605143	TITLE *605143 ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 1A; ACTR1A
;;ARP1;;
CENTRACTIN, ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ACTR1A is an essential subunit of the 20S dynactin complex, which is
involved in microtubule-dependent vesicular transport, spindle assembly,
and cell division. Polymers of 8 to 13 ACTR1 molecules make up the
central 37-nm filament that forms the base of the dynactin complex
(summary by Karki et al., 2000).

CLONING

By randomly sequencing a brain cDNA library, Adams et al. (1991)
identified a cDNA (EST00370) encoding a 37-amino acid peptide with 76%
similarity to actin.

Using oligonucleotide probes derived from clone EST00370 to screen a
teratocarcinoma library, Lees-Miller et al. (1992) obtained a cDNA
encoding ACTR1A, which they called actin-RPV (vertebrate actin-related
protein). Sequence analysis predicted that the 376-amino acid ACTR1A
protein shares only 69% amino acid similarity with vertebrate actins;
most of the nonconservative substitutions occur in the surface loops of
ACTR1A rather than the core structure. Two-dimensional immunoblot
analysis of the dynactin complex, an activator of dynein-driven vesicle
movement (see 601143), determined that ACTR1A is the most abundant
molecule in the complex and is expressed as a 45-kD protein with a pI of
6.8.

By screening a testis cDNA library with a canine alpha-centractin probe,
Clark et al. (1994) isolated cDNAs encoding ACTR1A, which they called
alpha-centractin. Northern blot analysis detected variable levels of a
3.0-kb ACTR1A transcript in all tissues tested. The same probe also
detected a 1.3-kb transcript representing a putative truncated isoform,
which the authors called centractin-gamma. Two-dimensional immunoblot
analysis determined that ACTR1A is expressed in the cytosol as part of
the dynactin complex as a 43-kD protein with a pI of 6.6; levels of
ACTR1A were at least 15-fold greater than those of ACTR1B (605144).

GENE FUNCTION

Eaton et al. (2002) disrupted the dynactin complex in Drosophila, using
3 separate perturbations: dsRNA interference with arp1, mutation in
p150/Glued (homolog of DCTN1; 601143), and a dominant-negative Glued
transgene. In all 3 cases, the disruption resulted in an increase in the
frequency and extent of synaptic retraction events at the neuromuscular
junction. Eaton et al. (2002) concluded that dynactin functions locally
within the presynaptic arbor to promote synapse stability at the
neuromuscular junction.

Karki et al. (2000) noted that one end of the ARP1 filament is likely
capped by the alpha (see 601580) and beta (CAPZB; 601572) subunits of
capping protein. They found that the other end of ARP1 was bound by p62
dynactin (DCTN4; 614758).

MAPPING

Gross (2012) mapped the ACTR1A gene to chromosome 10q24.32 based on an
alignment of the ACTR1A sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK302072) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

601572	TITLE *601572 CAPPING PROTEIN, BETA; CAPZB
;;CAP PROTEIN, ACTIN, BETA; CAPPB
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

CapZ was identified in chicken as an actin-binding protein composed of
alpha (see 601580) and beta subunits. From a human retina cDNA library,
Barron-Casella et al. (1995) isolated cDNAs homologous for the beta
subunit of chicken CapZ.

MAPPING

Barron-Casella et al. (1995) mapped the CAPZB gene to chromosome 1p36.1
by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

HISTORY

In the course of mapping 39 ESTs on chromosome 6p24-p23, Olavesen et al.
(1997) concluded that CAPZB is located in that region flanked by EDN1
(131240) on the centromeric side and TFAP2 (107580) on the telomeric
side. However, Cooper (1999) stated that a 'simple clerical error'
occurred at the outset of this project; the EST in question does not
share sequence similarity with the CAPZB gene and, therefore, the
mapping of the CAPZB gene to chromosome 6p24-p23 is incorrect.

104230	TITLE *104230 FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE 4; FUT4
;;ALPHA-3-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE; FCT3A
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

In human/mouse myeloid cell hybrids, Geurts van Kessel et al. (1984)
tested for reactivity with monoclonal antibodies with known myelocytic,
monocytic, or myelomonocytic specificity. Twenty antibodies, all of
which bound specifically to the surface of human myeloid cells,
exhibited similar reactivity patterns with the hybrid clones.
Chromosomal analysis showed that the gene or genes involved in
expression of the 1 or more antigens recognized by these antibodies must
be located on human chromosome 11q12-qter. This myeloid-associated
surface antigen was designated CD15 in the CD system.

Tetteroo et al. (1987) found that alpha-3-fucosyltransferase activity
correlated with the presence of human chromosome 11 in human-mouse
myeloid cell hybrids. Also, several other myeloid-associated
carbohydrate antigens, e.g., LeX (CD15), were associated with chromosome
11. Tetteroo et al. (1987) concluded that an alpha-3-fucosyltransferase
gene on chromosome 11 is responsible for synthesis of these antigens.

Couillin et al. (1991) identified an alpha-3-fucosyltransferase on
chromosome 11q, FUT4, that transferred fucose onto H type 2 more
efficiently than onto sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine, suggesting that it is
the myeloid type of alpha-3-fucosyltransferase that makes the
3-fucosyllactosamine epitope (CD15) on polymorphonuclear cells and
monocytes.

Of the fucosyltranstransferases examined by Cailleau-Thomas et al.
(2000), only FUT4 and FUT9 (606865) were expressed during human
embryogenesis; all of the others showed irregular or weak expression. By
Northern blot analysis of 40- to 70-day-old embryos, they found
increasing expression of 6-, 3-, and 2.3-kb FUT4 transcripts. Analysis
of fetal tissues revealed abundant expression in liver, muscle, kidney,
skin, and small intestine, and moderate expression in brain, lung, and
heart. The transcript size varied in different tissues. In adult
tissues, highest expression was found in lung and small intestine, low
expression in kidney, liver, and brain, and no expression in 12 other
tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakayama et al. (2001) showed that FUT9 directs CD15 synthesis in
lymphoid cells and mature granulocytes, whereas FUT4 directs CD15
synthesis in promyelocytes and monocytes. FUT9 exhibited stronger
activity for CD15 synthesis than FUT4.

MAPPING

Using human/mouse hybrid cell lines, Couillin et al. (1991) mapped a
human alpha-3-fucosyltransferase, FUT4, to chromosome 11q. Using panels
of somatic cell and radiation hybrids which retained different
rearrangements of chromosome 11, Reguigne et al. (1994) assigned the
FUT4 gene to chromosome 11q21, between D11S388 and D11S919. Using
fluorescence in situ hybridization and a cosmid containing FUT4
sequence, McCurley et al. (1995) confirmed the assignment of the FUT4
gene to chromosome 11q21.

Gersten et al. (1995) demonstrated that the mouse Fut4 gene maps to
chromosome 9 in a region showing syntenic homology with human 11q.

601746	TITLE *601746 HYPOXIA UP-REGULATED 1; HYOU1
;;OXYGEN-REGULATED PROTEIN, 150-KD; ORP150
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Astrocytes retain cell viability, even in extreme ischemia, and
proliferate in damaged brain (Petito et al., 1990; Janeczko, 1991). Rat
astrocytes exposed to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation were reported to
release increased amounts of interleukin-6 (147620) that could promote
neuronal survival in ischemic brain (Maeda et al., 1994). Kuwabara et
al. (1996) observed a 150-kD protein, called oxygen-regulated protein
(ORP150) by them, in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cultured
astrocytes that was induced specifically by hypoxia and not by other
stimuli.

Ikeda et al. (1997) reported the cloning of human and rat ORP150 cDNAs
from hypoxia-treated human astrocytoma U373 cells and rat astrocytes,
respectively. The full-length 4,503-bp human cDNA contains a 2,997-bp
open reading frame predicted to encode a polypeptide of 999 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of 111,330 Da. The deduced amino acid
sequences of human and rat ORP150 exhibit high similarity (over 90%
identity) to each other. The first 32 residues represent the signal
peptide necessary for secretion. The C-terminal KNDEL sequence resembles
KDEL, a motif found in ER-resident proteins, suggesting that ORP150
resides in the ER. The N-terminal half of ORP150 has a modest similarity
to the ATPase domain of numerous HSP70 family sequences (see 140550).
Northern blot analysis revealed a marked similarity of expression
between ORP150 and GRP78 (138120) in U373 cells during hypoxia stress.
(The GRP78 protein is produced in cultured rat astrocytes exposed to
hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation.) They also found that ORP150 mRNA was
highly expressed in the liver and pancreas, whereas little expression
was observed in the kidney and brain, similarly to the expression
pattern of GRP78. Ikeda et al. (1997) proposed that ORP150 plays an
important role in protein folding and secretion in the ER, perhaps as a
molecular chaperone in concert with other GRPs, to cope with
environmental stress.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HYOU1
gene to chromosome 11 (TMAP stSG31085).

GENE FUNCTION

Tamatani et al. (2001) found that although ORP150 was sparingly
upregulated in neurons from human brain undergoing ischemic stress,
there was robust induction in astrocytes. Cultured neurons
overexpressing ORP150 were resistant to hypoxemic stress, whereas
astrocytes with inhibited ORP150 expression were more vulnerable. Mice
with targeted neuronal overexpression of ORP150 had smaller strokes
compared with controls. Neurons with increased ORP150 demonstrated
suppressed caspase-3-like activity and enhanced brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (113505) under hypoxia signaling. Tamatani et
al. (2001) concluded that ORP150 is an integral participant in ischemic
cytoprotective pathways.

Ozawa et al. (2001) demonstrated coexpression, colocalization, and
coimmunoprecipitation of ORP150 and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; 192240) in the ER of macrophages within the neovasculature of
human wound granulation tissue. In vitro, inhibition of ORP150 resulted
in retention of VEGF within the ER, whereas overexpression of ORP150
promoted the secretion of VEGF into hypoxic culture supernatants,
indicating that ORP150 may participate in VEGF transport to the
cytoplasm. In wounds of diabetic mice, overexpression of ORP150 resulted
in accelerated repair and closure; suppression of ORP150 delayed repair.
Ozawa et al. (2001) concluded that ORP150 plays a role in the promotion
of angiogenesis, and more generally acts as a molecular chaperone under
hypoxic conditions to facilitate protein transport and processing in the
ER.

Two members of the HSP70 family are required for protein biogenesis in
the yeast endoplasmic reticulum: Lhs1 (homologous to HYOU1) and Kar2
(homologous to HSPA5, or BiP; 138120). Steel et al. (2004) found that
Lhs1 and Kar2 specifically interacted to couple, and coordinately
regulate, their respective activities. Lhs1 stimulated Kar2 by providing
a specific nucleotide exchange activity, whereas Kar2 reciprocally
activated the Lhs1 ATPase. In yeast, the 2 ATPase activities are
coupled, and their coordinated regulation is essential for normal
function in vivo.

Zhao et al. (2010) showed that overexpression of Hyou1 prevented ER
stress and rescued neurodegeneration of Purkinje cells in Sil1 (608005)
-/- mice, whereas decreasing expression of Hyou1 exacerbated these
phenotypes. Purkinje cells from the caudal lobules of the cerebellum
from Sil1 -/- mice typically do not show signs of ER stress; however,
decreased expression of Hyou1 in these cells resulted in signs of ER
stress, ubiquitin-positive inclusions, and death. Zhao et al. (2010)
suggested that HYOU1 and SIL1 have partially redundant functions as BiP
nucleotide exchange factors in Purkinje cells.

136132	TITLE *136132 FLAVIN-CONTAINING MONOOXYGENASE 3; FMO3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The mammalian flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO; EC 1.14.13.8)
represent a multigene family whose gene products are localized in the
endoplasmic reticulum of many tissues. These enzymes catalyze the
NADPH-dependent oxidative metabolism of many drugs, pesticides, and
other foreign compounds. Their substrates are soft nucleophiles with an
electron-rich center, typically a nitrogen, sulfur or
phosphorus-containing functional group, as the site for oxidative attack
by the enzyme (Ziegler, 1990; Hines et al., 1994).

CLONING

Lomri et al. (1992) isolated a full-length cDNA sequence for FMO3, which
they designated FMO II, from an adult human liver cDNA library. This
cDNA encoded a deduced 533-amino acid protein.

Dolphin et al. (1996) also isolated an FMO3 cDNA from a human liver
library. This cDNA encoded a deduced 532-amino acid protein that shared
84% sequence identity with the rabbit FMO3 protein.

GENE STRUCTURE

Dolphin et al. (1997) determined that the FMO3 gene contains 1 noncoding
and 8 coding exons.

MAPPING

By use of PCR with DNAs from somatic cell hybrids, Shephard et al.
(1993) mapped the FMO3 gene to chromosome 1. FMO3 is probably located in
a cluster with FMO1 (136130) and FMO4 (136131) at 1q23-q25.

GENE FUNCTION

Using quantitative RNase protection assays, Phillips et al. (1995) and
Dolphin et al. (1996) determined that FMO3 is present in low abundance
in fetal liver and lung and in adult kidney and lung, and in much
greater abundance in adult liver. They determined that FMO3 and FMO1
(136130) are subject to developmental and tissue-specific regulation
and, in the liver, there is a developmental switch in the expression of
these genes.

By Western blot analysis of human liver microsomal samples ranging from
8 weeks gestation to 18 years of age, Koukouritaki et al. (2002)
confirmed that FMO1 is the major fetal isoform and FMO3 is the major
adult isoform. The highest level of FMO1 expression was observed in
embryonic samples at 8 to 15 weeks of gestation; its expression was low,
but detectable in most samples within the first 3 days of life, but then
was extinguished in all but a few samples. In contrast, the onset of
FMO3 expression was highly variable, with most individuals failing to
express this isoform during the neonatal period. FMO3 was expressed at
intermediate levels until 11 years of age when a gender-independent
increase in FMO3 expression was observed during puberty. Koukouritaki et
al. (2002) observed pronounced interindividual variation of FMO3 protein
levels from 2- to 20-fold.

Phillips and Shephard (2008) noted that the delay between silencing of
the FMO1 gene and the full activation of FMO3 means that during the
first year of life many children have no, or very little,
drug-metabolizing FMOs in their liver.

Hernandez et al. (2003) pointed out that compromised activity of FMO3 is
expected to have implications for the efficacy of drug treatment and the
possibility of adverse drug reactions in patients with trimethylaminuria
(TMAU; 602079) and in the general population. In addition to
metabolizing the dietary-derived amine TMA, FMO3 catalyzes the
NADPH-dependent oxidation of numerous foreign compounds, including
therapeutic drugs such as the antiestrogen tamoxifen, the antifungal
ketoconazole, and the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs sulindac
sulfide and benzydamine, as reviewed by Cashman and Zhang (2002).
Sufferers of trimethylaminuria may display a reduced ability to
metabolize substrates for FMO3 such as nicotine (Ayesh et al., 1988).

FMO3 metabolizes a number of drugs, including amphetamine, clozapine,
deprenyl, metamphetamine, tamoxifen, ethionamide, thiacetazone, and
sulindac sulfide (see reviews by Krueger and Williams (2005) and
Phillips and Shephard (2008)).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Akerman et al. (1997) and Treacy et al. (1998) reported 3 different
mutations in the FMO3 gene in Australian probands with trimethylaminuria
(602079), or fish-odor syndrome, who shared a particular polymorphic
haplotype. Treacy et al. (1998) showed that these mutations impair
N-oxygenation of xenobiotics and are responsible for the
trimethylaminuria phenotype. A nonsense mutation, glu305 to ter (E305X;
136132.0001), was found on 6 mutant chromosomes of British origin,
homozygous in 1 and heterozygous in 4 individuals. Homozygosity for a
missense mutation, val257 to met (V257M; 136132.0002), was found in 1
individual of Greek origin. Heterozygosity for a met66-to-ile (M66I;
136132.0003) mutation was found in 1 individual of Irish extraction.

In a patient with trimethylaminuria, Dolphin et al. (1997) found a
pro153-to-leu mutation in the FMO3 gene (P153L; 136132.0004) that
abolished FMO3 catalytic activity. They demonstrated that FMO3 with the
551C-T mutation could not support the metabolism of dietary-derived
trimethylamine (TMA). In addition to TMA, FMOs catalyze the oxidation of
a range of structurally diverse compounds, including drugs, pesticides,
and other xenobiotics. The authors commented that although patients with
trimethylaminuria are apparently deficient in nicotine N-oxidation, a
reaction catalyzed predominantly by FMO3, the pharmacologic and
toxicologic significance of an inherited block in FMO3-mediated
oxidative metabolism is unclear.

Treacy et al. (1998) found that nonsense and missense mutations in the
FMO3 gene were associated with a severe trimethylaminuria phenotype and
were also implicated in impaired metabolism of other nitrogen- and
sulfur-containing substances, including biogenic amines, both clinically
and when mutated proteins expressed from cDNA were studied in vitro. The
findings illustrated the clinical role played by human FMO3 in the
metabolism of xenobiotic substrates and endogenous amines. One patient
of English-Irish extraction with severe hypertension was observed with
blood pressure of 200/110 following the use of nasal epinephrine.
Adverse tyramine reactions were observed in at least 3 patients.
Urticaria and intolerance of sulfur-containing medication was observed
in a patient homozygous for the P153L mutation.

Chung and Cha (1997) showed that production of theobromine from caffeine
is catalyzed primarily by the FMO present in adult human liver
microsomes. They determined FMO activity in vivo noninvasively by taking
the urinary molar concentration ratio of theobromine/caffeine in a
Korean population. In 82 Korean volunteers, Park et al. (1999)
determined FMO activity by taking the molar concentration ratio of
theobromine and caffeine present in the 1-hour urine (between 4 and 5
hours) samples collected after administration of a cup of coffee
containing 110 mg of caffeine. Among 82 volunteers, there were 19 women
and 63 men (30 smokers and 52 nonsmokers). Volunteers were divided into
2 groups comprising low (0.53-2.99) and high (3.18-11.95) FMO activities
separated by an antimode of 3.18. Genomic DNAs from peripheral blood
were amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides designed from intronic
sequences of the human FMO3 gene. Comparing nucleotide sequences of the
amplified FMO3 gene originating from randomly selected individuals with
low and high FMO activities, 9 point mutations were identified in the
open reading frame sequences.

Akerman et al. (1999) studied a cohort of North American individuals
with severe trimethylaminuria, defined by a reduction of TMA oxidation
below 50% of normal. They detected 4 novel FOM3 mutations, including 2
missense mutations, ala52 to thr (A52T; 136132.0008) and arg387 to leu
(R387L; 136132.0007), and 1 nonsense mutation, glu314 to ter (E314X;
136132.0009). The fourth allele was apparently composed of 2 relatively
common polymorphisms (lys158-gly308) found in the general population.
For the E314X mutation, loss of activity was strongly predicted due to
truncation of the FMO3 protein at codon 314, since deletion of even the
final 30 amino acids of this 532-residue protein will ablate function in
vitro. While the A52T and R387L mutations had not been expressed, they
satisfied several conditions for designation as disease-causing: the
changes were not observed in controls, they were nonconservative
substitutions, and no other changes were identified in the probands when
sequencing all expressed FMO3 exons. Furthermore, the A52T and R387L
residues appear to be highly conserved within the FMO gene family. The
authors suggested that the 2 common changes (lys158-gly308) in cis
diminished the activity of the enzyme and rendered it incapable of
compensating for the A52T mutation carried by the other allele.

Hernandez et al. (2003) described a human FMO3 mutation database. They
indicated that 16 mutations (12 missense, 3 nonsense, and 1 gross
deletion) were known to cause trimethylaminuria.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, GLU305TER

Akerman et al. (1997) identified a glu305-to-ter (E305X) mutation in 6
mutant chromosomes from Australian probands of British origin with
trimethylaminuria (602079). The mutation was homozygous in 1 and
heterozygous in 4 individuals. The E305X homozygote had, in addition to
trimethylaminuria, tachycardia and severe hypertension after eating
cheese (which contains tyramine) and after using nasal epinephrine in
the treatment of an epistaxis (Danks et al., 1976). The FMO3 enzyme
metabolizes tyramine. Mutant FMO3 cDNA for this mutation demonstrated
loss of substrate activity for TMA and tyramine when expressed in E.
coli.

.0002
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, VAL257MET

In an Australian individual of Greek origin with trimethylaminuria
(602079), Akerman et al. (1997) found homozygosity for a val257-to-met
(V257M) missense mutation.

.0003
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, MET66ILE

In an Australian individual of Irish origin with trimethylaminuria
(602079), Akerman et al. (1997) found a met66-to-ile (M66I) mutation in
the FMO3 gene in heterozygous state. Mutant FMO3 cDNA containing the
M66I substitution demonstrated loss of substrate activity for TMA and
tyramine when expressed in E. coli.

In an Australian patient with trimethylaminuria, Akerman et al. (1999)
found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the FMO3 gene:
M66I and arg492 to trp (136132.0005). The second of these mutations
involved a hypermutable CpG site and was a nonconservative change in a
highly conserved region of the FMO3 gene. This arginine in codon 492 was
conserved in all FMO isoforms.

.0004
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, PRO153LEU

In a brother and sister of a family with trimethylaminuria (602079),
Dolphin et al. (1997) identified a homozygous 551C-T transition in the
FMO3 gene, changing a CCC proline triplet at codon 153 to a CTC leucine
triplet (P153L). Their parents and a third sib were heterozygous. They
found the same mutation in 2 other trimethylaminuria kindreds, in which
it also cosegregated with the disorder. In the first kindred studied,
the leu153 allele was found to carry a polymorphism at codon 158, namely
glu158. Among 30 unrelated, non-trimethylaminuric individuals, pro153
was found in all, whereas glu158 and lys158 occurred in frequencies of
approximately 50% each.

.0005
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, ARG492TRP

See 136132.0003 and Akerman et al. (1999).

.0006
FMO3 ACTIVITY, DECREASED
FMO3, GLY148TER

Park et al. (1999) determined FMO activity by taking the molar
concentration ratio of theobromine and caffeine present in the 1-hour
urine (between 4 and 5 hours) samples collected after administration of
a cup of coffee containing 110 mg of caffeine. In an individual who had
the second lowest FMO activity, they detected a missense mutation,
442G-T in exon 4, that yielded a premature TGA stop codon replacing
glycine-148. He had the mutation in heterozygous state. His mother also
had the heterozygous stop codon and equally low FMO activity.

.0007
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, ARG387LEU

In a Metis patient from Canada with trimethylaminuria (602079), Akerman
et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide
1160 of the FMO3 gene, resulting in an arg387-to-leu mutation.

.0008
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, ALA52THR

In a North American patient with trimethylaminuria (602079), Akerman et
al. (1999) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 154 of the FMO3
gene, resulting in an ala52-to-thr mutation.

.0009
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, GLU314TER

In a North American patient with trimethylaminuria (602079), Akerman et
al. (1999) identified a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 940 of the
FMO3 gene, resulting in a glu314-to-ter substitution.

.0010
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, ASN61SER

Dolphin et al. (2000) found 2 individuals with trimethylaminuria
(602079) who were compound heterozygotes for the P153L missense mutation
(136132.0004) and a novel asn61-to-ser (N61S) mutation in the FMO3 gene.

.0011
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, MET434ILE

Dolphin et al. (2000) found that a patient with trimethylaminuria
(602079) was a compound heterozygote for the R492W mutation
(136132.0005) and a novel met434-to-ile (M434I) mutation in the FMO3
gene.

.0012
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, 2-EX DEL

Forrest et al. (2001) described trimethylaminuria (602079) caused by a
deletion of more than 12 kb in the FMO3 gene in a 15-year-old Australian
male of Greek parents. The deletion began 328 bp upstream from exon 1;
the 3-prime end of the deletion occurred in intron 2. The deletion was
12,226 bp long. Because of homozygosity for the FMO3 gene deletion, it
was predicted that in addition to loss of monooxygenase function for
human FMO3 substrates, such as trimethylamine and other amines, the
proband would exhibit decreased tolerance of biogenic amines, both
medicinal and dietary.

.0013
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, GLU32LYS

In a patient with trimethylaminuria (602079), Zhang et al. (2003)
identified a glu32-to-lys (E32K) mutation in the FMO3 gene. Expression
studies showed that the E32K mutation abrogated the catalytic activity
of the enzyme.

.0014
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA
FMO3, 1-BP DEL, 191A

In an individual with trimethylaminuria (602079), Zhang et al. (2003)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the FMO3 gene: a
P153L change (136132.0004) and a 1-bp deletion (191delA) in exon 3 at
codon 64. The deletion resulted in a frameshift and premature
termination of the gene immediately after codon 65. Family pedigree
analysis revealed that the 2 mutations were carried on different alleles
in this individual. Both mutations abolished the catalytic activity of
the enzyme, explaining the severe clinical expression of
trimethylaminuria. The patient was examined at the age of 3 years, at
which time he was found to have 61% unmetabolized trimethylamine in
urine, compatible with severe trimethylaminuria.

.0015
TRIMETHYLAMINURIA, MILD
FMO3, GLU308GLY AND GLU158LYS

In patients with mild trimethylaminuria, Zschocke et al. (1999)
identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the FMO3 gene: a
P151L substitution (136132.004) on one allele, and 2 common
polymorphisms, glu308 to gly (E308G) and glu 158 to lys (E258K), on the
other. Zschocke et al. (1999) noted that homozygosity for the P151L
mutation had been found to cause severe trimethylaminuria. They found
that individuals homozygous for the variant allele with the 2 common
polymorphisms had decreased TMA oxidation capacity (less than 50%)
indicative of mild trimethylaminuria,

607888	TITLE *607888 CKLF-LIKE MARVEL TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAIN-CONTAINING 5; CMTM5
;;CHEMOKINE-LIKE FACTOR SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 5; CKLFSF5
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the chemokine-like factor superfamily, including CKLFSF5,
share similarity with both the chemokine (see 604852) and the
transmembrane 4 (see 300191) superfamilies of signaling molecules.

CLONING

By screening databases for sequences that share homology with
chemokine-like factor (CKLF), followed by RT-PCR of a brain cDNA
library, Han et al. (2003) cloned CKLFSF5. They also identified
alternatively spliced variants. One isoform encodes a 156-amino acid
protein with 4 transmembrane segments. CKLFSF5 shares about 40% sequence
identity with CKLFSF3 (607886). Northern blot analysis detected a
1.22-kb transcript and several minor transcripts expressed at high
levels in brain. Han et al. (2003) also cloned mouse Cklfsf5, which
shares about 90% sequence similarity with CKLFSF5.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Han et al. (2003) mapped the CKLFSF5 gene
to chromosome 14. They also mapped the mouse Cklfsf5 gene to chromosome
14.

190230	TITLE *190230 TRANSFORMING GROWTH FACTOR, BETA-3; TGFB3
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Beta-type transforming growth factors are polypeptides that act
hormonally to control the proliferation and differentiation of multiple
cell types. A cDNA clone for a third form of TGFB was isolated by ten
Dijke et al. (1988). The C-terminal 112 amino acids of TGF-beta-3 share
approximately 80% sequence identity with beta-1 (190180) and beta-2
(190220).

Moren et al. (1992) isolated full-length cDNAs for TGFB3 from a human
placenta cDNA library. The coding region encoded a protein of 849 amino
acids with a single transmembrane domain and a short stretch of the
intracellular domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Graycar et al. (1989) purified to apparent homogeneity human TGFB3 and
evaluated its activities in comparison to TGFB1 and TGFB2.

Lee and Nowak (2001) compared expression of the TGFB isoforms in normal
myometrium and benign leiomyoma tumors of the uterus (150699) and
examined the effects of TGFBs on cell proliferation and collagen
production by these cells in vitro. Northern blot analysis showed that
the levels of TGFB1 mRNA were similar between leiomyoma and myometrium,
whereas leiomyoma showed 5-fold higher levels of expression of TGFB3
mRNA than autologous myometrium. Expression of TGFB3 protein detected by
immunohistochemistry was much more intense in leiomyoma tissues than in
corresponding myometrium. The authors concluded that their results
support the hypothesis that alterations in the TGFB system produce loss
of sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of TGFB, and increased
expression of TGFB3 may contribute to the growth of these tumors.

Epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of the medial edge
epithelial seam creates palatal confluence. Nawshad and Hay (2003)
showed that Tgfb3 brought about palatal seam EMT in mice by stimulating
expression of Lef1 (153245) in medial edge epithelial cells. Tgfb3
activated Lef1 in the absence of beta-catenin (CTNNB1; 116806) via
nuclear phospho-Smad2 (601366) and Smad4 (600993).

MAPPING

By Southern analysis of DNA prepared from somatic cell hybrids and by in
situ hybridization, ten Dijke et al. (1988) assigned the TGFB3 gene to
chromosome 14q23-q24. Barton et al. (1988) likewise assigned the TGFB3
gene to chromosome 14 and regionalized it to 14q24 by Southern blot
analysis of hybrid cell DNAs and by in situ hybridization.

The mouse Tgfb3 gene was mapped to chromosome 12 (Barton et al., 1988;
Dickinson et al., 1990).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Beffagna et al. (2005) screened 38 members of a 4-generation Italian
family with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia-1 (ARVD1;
107970), previously reported by Rampazzo et al. (2003), and identified a
mutation (190230.0001) in the 5-prime UTR of the TGFB3 gene. Subsequent
screening of 30 unrelated individuals with ARVD1 led to the
identification of an additional mutation (190230.0002) in the 3-prime
UTR of the TGFB3 gene in 1 patient. In transfection studies, both
mutations showed significantly higher luciferase reporter activity
(about 2.5-fold, p less than 0.01) compared to wildtype.

In a case-control study of 711 Japanese individuals with ossification of
the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL; 602475) and 896
controls, Horikoshi et al. (2006) found an association between an
intronic SNP in the TGFB3 gene (dbSNP rs2268624) and OPLL.

ANIMAL MODEL

Proetzel et al. (1995) produced Tgfb3-null mice in which exon 6 of the
Tgfb3 gene was replaced by the neomycin-resistance gene. Whereas
heterozygotes had no apparent phenotypic change, homozygotes had an
incompletely penetrant failure of the palatal shelves to fuse, leading
to cleft palate. The defect appeared to result from impaired adhesion of
the apposing medial edge epithelial of the palatal shelves and
subsequent elimination of the midline epithelial seam. No craniofacial
abnormalities were observed. Defective palatogenesis was also found in
homozygous Tgfb3-null mutant mice by Kaartinen et al. (1995) who also
found a consistent delay in pulmonary development. They suggested that
the study demonstrates an essential function for TGF-beta-3 in normal
palate and lung morphogenesis and implicates this cytokine in
epithelial-mesenchymal interaction.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR DYSPLASIA 1
TGFB3, -36G-A, 5-PRIME UTR

In 9 affected and 3 unaffected members of a 4-generation Italian family
with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia-1 (ARVD1; 107970)
previously reported by Rampazzo et al. (2003), Beffagna et al. (2005)
identified a G-to-A transition at cDNA position -36 in the 5-prime UTR
of the TGFB3 gene. In transfection studies, the mutant construct showed
significantly higher luciferase reporter activity (about 2.5-fold, p
less than 0.01) compared to wildtype constructs. All clinically affected
members of the family had the mutation; Beffagna et al. (2005) stated
that detection of the mutation in 3 apparently healthy individuals was
consistent with reduced penetrance.

.0002
ARRHYTHMOGENIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR DYSPLASIA 1
TGFB3, 1723C-T, 3-PRIME UTR

In a young man with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia-1 (ARVD1;
107970), Beffagna et al. (2005) identified a C-to-T transition at cDNA
position 1723 in the 3-prime UTR of the TGFB3 gene. In transfection
studies, the mutant construct showed significantly higher luciferase
reporter activity (about 2.5-fold, p less than 0.01) compared to
wildtype constructs. The patient had a brother who died suddenly at the
age of 16 and was found to have ARVD at autopsy.

605482	TITLE *605482 GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE, OMEGA-1; GSTO1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The glutathione S-transferases (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) are a family of
enzymes responsible for the metabolism of a broad range of xenobiotics
and carcinogens (Mannervik, 1985). This enzyme catalyzes the reaction of
glutathione with a wide variety of organic compounds to form thioethers,
a reaction that is sometimes a first step in a detoxification process
leading to mercapturic acid formation.

Based on amino acid sequence similarities and antibody
cross-reactivities, the mammalian cytosolic GSTs are divided into
several classes, including alpha (e.g., 138359), mu (e.g., 138350),
kappa (602321), theta (e.g., 600436), pi (134660), omega, and zeta
(603758). In addition, there is a class of microsomal GSTs (e.g.,
138330).

CLONING

By searching an EST database for homologies with GSTZ1 (603758), Board
et al. (2000) identified a cDNA encoding GSTO1, the first member of the
omega GST class. The deduced 241-amino acid protein has over 70%
identity with the rodent omega GST sequences. Of the previously defined
GST classes, the omega GSTS are most similar to the zeta class. The
omega class GSTs possess a 19- to 20-residue N-terminal extension, not
observed in other GSTs, that abuts the C terminus to form a novel
structural unit. Northern blot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression
of a 0.8-kb GSTO1 transcript, with highest expression in liver, skeletal
muscle, and heart, and lowest expression in brain, placenta, and lung.
Board et al. (2000) noted that the ubiquitous expression of GSTO1
contrasts with the tissue-specific expression typical of many GSTs.
Western blot analysis of cytosolic extracts and recombinant protein
showed that GSTO1 is expressed as a 31-kD protein in its monomeric form.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Cystral Structure

Crystal structure analysis of GSTO1 by Board et al. (2000) demonstrated
that GSTO1 has an N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain consisting of a
central 4-stranded beta sheet flanked on one side by 2 alpha helices and
on the other by a 3-10 helix. The C terminus is composed of 7 alpha
helices and makes several H bonds with the N-terminal domain. GSTO1
forms a dimer and adopts the typical GST tertiary structure.

GENE FUNCTION

Functional analyses by Board et al. (2000) showed that GSTO1 lacks
activity with most GST substrates but exhibits glutathione-dependent
thiol transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activity characteristic
of the glutaredoxins (e.g., GLRX, 600443). Whitbread et al. (2003)
stated that GSTO1 also reduces monomethylarsonic acid to
monomethylarsonous acid, which is the rate-limiting step in the
biotransformation of inorganic arsenic.

Kim et al. (2012) found that the Gsto1a and Gsto1b isoforms of
Drosophila Gsto1 had distinct physiologic activities. Gsto1b protected
flies against oxidative stress, whereas Gsto1a increased mitochondrial
ATPase synthase complex assembly and activity by glutathionylation of
the ATP synthase beta subunit (ATP5B; 102910). Overexpression of Gsto1a
partially reversed the phenotype of parkin (PARK2; 602544) mutant files,
including degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and muscle, cellular
tubulin (see 602529) accumulation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Kim
et al. (2012) concluded that Drosophila Gsto1 plays a protective role in
parkin mutants by regulating mitochondrial ATP synthase activity.

GENE STRUCTURE

Whitbread et al. (2003) determined that the GSTO1 gene contains 6 exons
and spans 12.5 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH and somatic cell hybrid analyses, Whitbread et al. (2003) mapped
the GSTO1 gene to chromosome 10q24-q25, about 7.5-kb upstream of the
GSTO2 gene (612314). Whitbread et al. (2003) also identified an apparent
GSTO1-related pseudogene on chromosome 3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

By database analysis, Whitbread et al. (2003) identified several
putative polymorphisms in the coding region of GSTO1 and confirmed 11 of
these by reexamining the cDNA sequences. They identified 2 of the
polymorphisms in their study population (100 European Australians, 62
Bantu Africans, and 100 Southern Chinese). One was a 419C-T transition
resulting in an ala140-to-asp (A140D) substitution; the frequency of the
D140 allele was notably different between the groups, being highest in
Australians and lowest in Africans. The other was a rare splicing
polymorphism at IVS4, resulting in deletion of glu155 (E155del). Only 1
Chinese individual was homozygous for the deletion. In vitro assays
showed that the A140D substitution had no effect on the thioltransferase
and GSH-conjugation activity of GSTO1, whereas E155del polymorphism
resulted in significantly higher GSTO1 activity in both assays. The
E155del variant also showed lower thermal stability than the other
variants.

ANIMAL MODEL

Kim et al. (2012) found that knockdown of Gsto1 in Drosophila resulted
in no obvious defects in adult morphology. However, mutant flies were
sensitive to paraquat, an oxidative stress inducer. Double mutation of
parkin and Gsto1a accentuated the phenotype of parkin mutant flies, with
dramatically enhanced degeneration of indirect flight muscles.

608442	TITLE *608442 SYNAPTIC NUCLEAR ENVELOPE PROTEIN 2; SYNE2
;;NUCLEAR ENVELOPE SPECTRIN REPEAT PROTEIN 2;;
NESPRIN 2;;
NUCLEUS AND ACTIN CONNECTING ELEMENT; NUANCE;;
KIAA1011
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching sequence databases for homologs of SYNE1 (608441), Apel et
al. (2000) identified cDNAs encoding SYNE2. Like SYNE1, SYNE2 contains
multiple spectrin repeats and a 60-amino acid C-terminal region
homologous to the Drosophila protein Klarsicht. RT-PCR analysis showed
low to moderate expression of 2 SYNE2 splice variants in most tissues
examined, including skeletal and cardiac muscle, kidney, liver,
pancreas, and placenta, and indicated that alternative splicing patterns
are conserved between SYNE1 and SYNE2.

By searching sequence databases using SYNE1 as probe, followed by PCR
and RACE of several cDNA libraries, Zhang et al. (2001) isolated cDNAs
encoding SYNE2, which they called nesprin-2. The use of alternate
initiation sites and alternative splicing results in 3 major
transcripts, encoding proteins of 542 amino acids (nesprin-2-alpha), 763
amino acids (nesprin-2-beta), and 3,270 amino acids (nesprin-2-gamma),
as well as several other minor variants. All 3 nesprin-2 proteins
contain multiple spectrin repeats, a transmembrane domain within the
C-terminal Klarsicht homology domain, and several N-glycosylation and
phosphorylation sites. Nesprin-2-gamma also has a bipartite nuclear
localization signal and a leucine zipper motif. Northern blot analysis
detected high expression of a 2.7-kb transcript in pancreas, heart, and
skeletal muscle, and widespread low expression of numerous additional
transcripts ranging in size from 3.1 to 11 kb.

By genomic sequence analysis, RT-PCR, and RACE, Zhang et al. (2002) and
Zhen et al. (2002) extended the sequence of SYNE2 and showed that it
encodes a 6,884-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of
796 kD. They identified an N-terminal actin-binding region containing 2
tandem calponin (see 600806) homology domains, as well as an extension
of the spectrin repeat-containing helical rod domain. The actin-binding
domain shares high homology with the corresponding domains of enaptin
and calmin and 97% amino acid identity with the actin-binding domain of
mouse Syne2 (Zhen et al., 2002). Zhang et al. (2002) also identified
SYNE2 homologs in Drosophila and C. elegans.

By Northern dot-blot analysis, Zhen et al. (2002) detected widespread
expression of SYNE2, with highest levels in kidney, liver, stomach,
placenta, spleen, lymphatic nodes, and peripheral blood lymphocytes.
Lowest levels were in skeletal muscle and brain. Zhen et al. (2002)
generated antibody against the actin-binding domain of SYNE2 and, using
fractionation and immunofluorescence, showed that SYNE2 localized to
nuclear membranes with a punctate staining pattern, as well as to the
nucleus, with enrichment at nucleoli. In mitotic cells, SYNE2 associated
with the nuclear envelope during its breakdown and with condensed
chromosomes at prometaphase, then was present throughout the cytoplasm
at later mitotic stages.

GENE FUNCTION

Using fusion proteins, Zhang et al. (2001) determined that SYNE2
requires its C-terminal transmembrane domain to localize to the nuclear
envelope. When the transmembrane domain was deleted, the remaining
C-terminal domain was sufficient to direct nuclear targeting.

Zhen et al. (2002) found that SYNE2 associated with F-actin filaments
via its actin-binding domain in cosedimentation assays. Using fusion
proteins, they showed that the spectrin repeat domains of SYNE2
associated with intracellular membranes and with vesicular structures
colocalizing with beta-COP (600959).

GENE STRUCTURE

Zhen et al. (2002) and Zhang et al. (2002) determined that the SYNE2
gene contains 115 exons and spans approximately 370 kb.

MAPPING

By FISH, Zhang et al. (2001) mapped the SYNE2 gene to chromosome 14q23.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a father and his 2 children with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(EDMD5; 612999), Zhang et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous mutation
in the SYNE2 gene (T89M; 608442.0001). In a second unrelated family, an
affected woman was heterozygous for the T89M mutation. Patient
fibroblasts and muscle cells showed loss of nuclear envelope integrity
with mislocalization of LMNA (150330) and emerin (EMD; 300384).
Immunofluorescent studies showed loss of SYNE2 expression in the nuclear
envelope and mitochondria of patient fibroblasts. These same changes
were also observed in fibroblasts from patients with other genetic forms
of EDMD, indicating that loss of nesprin is a characteristic of all
forms of EDMD. RNA interference of SYNE2 recapitulated the nuclear
defects membrane defects and changes in the organization of intranuclear
heterochromatin observed in patient cells. Overall, the findings showed
the importance of the nesprin/emerin/lamin complex in the maintenance of
nuclear stability and suggested that changes in the binding
stoichiometry of these proteins is a feature of EDMD. Zhang et al.
(2007) concluded that the disorder is caused in part by uncoupling of
the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton.

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2009) showed that Sun1 (607723) and Sun2 (613569)
double-knockout (Sun1/2 DKO) mice and Syne1 and Syne2 double-knockout
(Syne1/2 DKO) mice had similar defects in brain development. Sun1/2 DKO
and Syne1/2 DKO brains were small and showed defective laminary
structures in many brain regions. Examination of neocortex revealed
failure of radial neuronal migration, but not tangential migration of
interneurons, in both Sun1/2 DKO and Syne1/2 DKO mice. Intracellular
movement of nuclei is a prerequisite for proper neuron migration and
development, and Zhang et al. (2009) showed that Sun1 and Sun2 anchored
Syne2 to the nuclear envelope, while Syne1 and Syne2 connected the
nuclear envelope to the microtubule network, permitting nuclear
movement. Syne2 single-knockout mice exhibited defects in learning a
T-maze and were hyperactive in a new environment, but they had no
significant defects in balance or locomotion. Zhang et al. (2009)
concluded that a complex made up of SUN1, SUN2, SYNE1, and SYNE2 is
required for neuronal nuclear movement and for neuronal migration and
development.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY 5
SYNE2, THR89MET

In a father and his 2 children with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
(EDMD5; 612999), Zhang et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 466C-T
transition in exon 3 of the SYNE2 gene, resulting in a thr89-to-met
(T89M) substitution in the first spectrin repeat. The father had general
weakness since age 37 years, ptosis, increased serum creatin kinase, and
left ventricular hypertrophy. His daughter had transient cardiac
arrhythmia at age 10 to 14 years, and his son had limb weakness and
winged scapulae at age 8 years, minor respiratory insufficiency, but no
cardiac involvement. In a second unrelated family with EDMD5, an
affected woman was heterozygous for the T89M mutation, and her affected
son was compound heterozygous for T89M and a variant in the SYNE1 gene
(V572L; 608442.0009), which was also present in heterozygosity in the
unaffected father. The mother had a history of muscle weakness and died
at 30 years of age from cardiomyopathy, her son had muscular dystrophy
combined with severe dilated cardiomyopathy requiring heart transplant
at age 26. The mutation was not found in 384 control alleles. In vitro
functional expression assays showed no change in binding of the SYNE2
T89M protein to emerin (EMD; 300384), but patient fibroblasts and muscle
cells showed decreased localization of EMD, LMNA (150330), and SYNE2 to
the nuclear envelope, impaired binding interactions of these 3 proteins,
and disruptions in the organization of intranuclear heterochromatin.

;;THYROID HORMONE RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN, 150-KD; TRAP150
DESCRIPTION For background information on thyroid hormone receptor-associated
proteins (TRAPs), see 300182.

Using a HeLa cell line, Ito et al. (1999) cloned TRAP150, the gene
encoding the 150-kD subunit of the TRAP complex. The TRAP150 cDNA
encodes a 955-amino acid protein with no obvious known sequence motifs.
Sequence comparisons revealed a gene of unknown function, designated
KIAA0164 by Nagase et al. (1996), that encodes a related human protein
(overall identity of 40% and similarity of 55%), thus indicating a
putative gene family. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues
showed that the TRAP150 gene is ubiquitously expressed as an
approximately 5.0-kb transcript.

;;CHURCHILL; CHCH;;
CHROMOSOME 14 OPEN READING FRAME 52; C14ORF52
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a differential screen to identify early response genes in chicken
epiblast cells exposed to a Hensen node graft, Sheng et al. (2003)
cloned Chch. They obtained human and rodent CHCH by database searching
and PCR. The deduced CHCH protein in all species contains 112 amino
acids and has 2 putative C4-type zinc fingers, inspiring the gene name
Churchill by analogy to Sir Winston's famous gesture. Human CHCH shares
about 70% amino acid identity with fish and frog Chch and 96.4% identity
with rat and mouse Chch.

GENE FUNCTION

Sheng et al. (2003) found that Chch acts as a switch between the
different roles played by FGF (see 131220) in early chicken and frog
development. FGF induced Chch slowly, which then activated
Smad-interacting protein-1 (ZEB2; 605802), blocking further induction of
mesoderm markers by FGF. Chch was first expressed when cells stopped
migrating through the primitive streak, and Chch regulated cell
ingression.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the CHCH
gene to chromosome 14 (TMAP SHGC-33304).

612871	TITLE *612871 Na+/K+ TRANSPORTING ATPase-INTERACTING 1; NKAIN1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

NKAIN1 is a member of a family of mammalian proteins with similarity to
Drosophila Nkain and interacts with the beta subunit of Na,K-ATPase
(ATP1B1; 182330) (Gorokhova et al., 2007).

CLONING

Using EST database analysis to screen for novel proteins expressed in
the mammalian central nervous system, followed by RT-PCR of mouse brain
RNA, Gorokhova et al. (2007) cloned mouse Nkain1 and identified human
NKAIN1. NKAIN1 contains a predicted cleavable signal peptide and 3
putative transmembrane domains. Mouse Nkain1 shares 60% amino acid
similarity with the first 200 amino acids of the Drosophila ortholog,
which extends for an additional 458 amino acids in a C-terminal tail
absent from mouse Nkain1. RT-PCR analysis detected expression in mouse
brain and testis only. Immunohistochemical studies localized Nkain1 to
the cell membrane when expressed in HEK293T cells, and double-staining
with marker NeuN showed that Nkain1 expression was neuron specific.

GENE FUNCTION

By yeast 2-hybrid screening of a mouse brain cDNA library using Nkain1 C
terminus as bait, followed by additional 2-hybrid studies and
coimmunoprecipitation, Gorokhova et al. (2007) showed that Nkain1
interacted with the C-terminal 56 amino acids of ATP1B1.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that Nkain1, ATP1B1, and MONAKA
(PXK; 611450) form a complex in transfected HEK293T cells. Nkain1 failed
to induce a Na(+) conductance in Xenopus oocytes, in contrast to the
Drosophila ortholog, which can induce a small but significant
amiloride-insensitive Na(+) conductance when expressed in Xenopus
oocytes.

MAPPING

By database analysis, Gorokhova et al. (2007) mapped the NKAIN1 gene to
chromosome 1p35.2 and the mouse Nkain1 gene to chromosome 4D3.

ANIMAL MODEL

Gorokhova et al. (2007) showed that a Drosophila mutant carrying a
P-element insertion in the first exon of Nkain displayed a
temperature-sensitive phenotype characterized by development of
decreased coordination, seizure-like movements, and paralysis when
placed at 38 degrees C.

;;HEAB
HEAB/AF10 FUSION GENE, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By cloning and sequencing a complex rearrangement involving chromosomes
10 and 11, Tanabe et al. (1996) obtained a partial genomic clone of
HEAB. By 5-prime and 3-prime RACE of several cDNA libraries, they
obtained a full-length cDNA. The 3-prime UTR contains 2 putative
polyadenylation sites. The deduced 425-amino acid protein is valine- and
leucine-rich and contains a domain sharing similarity with the
ATP/GTP-binding domain of ABC transporters. It also has a possible
tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site. Northern blot analysis detected a
major 2.0-kb transcript that was expressed ubiquitously, with highest
expression in testis and skeletal muscle. A 3.2-kb transcript was less
abundant in many tissues, with highest expression in peripheral blood
leukocytes and thymus.

De Vries et al. (2000) purified pre-mRNA cleavage factor IIm (CFIIm) of
the 3-prime end processing complex (see 604978) from HeLa cell nuclear
extracts and determined that it contains PCF11 (608876) and CLP1. By
searching databases and PCR of a HeLa cell cDNA library, they cloned
CLP1. The deduced protein contains highly conserved Walker A and B
motifs, which have been implicated in ATP/GTP binding.

GENE FUNCTION

De Vries et al. (2000) found that immunodepletion of CLP1 reduced
pre-mRNA cleavage activity, but not polyadenylation activity, in
purified HeLa cell CFIIm. CLP1 interacted with CFIm and
cleavage-polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF; see 606027),
suggesting that it bridges these two 3-prime end processing factors
within the cleavage complex.

Paushkin et al. (2004) identified and characterized the human tRNA
splicing endonuclease (see SEN2; 608753). They found that human
endonuclease complexes are associated with pre-mRNA 3-prime end
processing factors, including CLP1. Small interfering RNA-mediated
depletion of SEN2 led to defects in maturation of both pre-tRNA and
pre-mRNA. These findings demonstrated a link between pre-tRNA splicing
and pre-mRNA 3-prime end formation, suggesting that the endonuclease
subunits function in multiple RNA processing events.

Weitzer and Martinez (2007) applied a chromatographic approach that
resulted in the identification of the human protein CLP1, a component of
both tRNA splicing and mRNA 3-prime-end formation machineries, as the
RNA kinase responsible for phosphorylation of the 5-prime end of siRNAs
necessary for their subsequent incorporation into the RISC complex
(RNA-induced silencing complex). Weitzer and Martinez (2007) reported
that the kinase CLP1 phosphorylates and licenses synthetic siRNAs to
become assembled into RISC for subsequent target RNA cleavage. More
importantly, Weitzer and Martinez (2007) demonstrated that the
physiologic role of CLP1 as the RNA kinase that phosphorylates the
5-prime end of the 3-prime exon during human tRNA splicing, allowing the
subsequent ligation of both exon halves by an unknown tRNA ligase.

MAPPING

By somatic cell hybrid analysis and FISH, Tanabe et al. (1996) mapped
the CLP1 gene to chromosome 11p12.

CYTOGENETICS

Tanabe et al. (1996) identified an invins(10;11)(p12;q23q12) and other
complex chromosomal rearrangements in a 2-year old boy with acute
monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5). Cloning of the proximal 10p breakpoint
showed that the MLL gene (159555) at chromosome 11q23 was fused to the
3-prime portion of AF10 (MLLT10; 602409) at chromosome 10p12. Cloning of
the telomeric 10p junction revealed that the 5-prime portion of AF10 was
fused with the HEAB gene. The 5-prime AF10/HEAB fusion transcript was
out of frame.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hanada et al. (2013) generated kinase-dead Clp1 mice that showed a
progressive loss of spinal motor neurons associated with axonal
degeneration in the peripheral nerves and denervation of neuromuscular
junctions, resulting in impaired motor function, muscle weakness,
paralysis, and fatal respiratory failure. Transgenic rescue experiments
showed that Clp1 functions in motor neurons. Mechanistically, loss of
Clp1 activity results in accumulation of a novel set of small RNA
fragments, derived from aberrant processing of tyrosine pre-transfer
RNA. These tRNA fragments sensitize cells to oxidative stress-induced
p53 (191170) activation and p53-dependent cell death. Genetic
inactivation of p53 rescues Clp1 kinase-dead mice from the motor neuron
loss, muscle denervation, and respiratory failure. Hanada et al. (2013)
concluded that their experiments uncovered a mechanistic link between
tRNA processing, formation of a new RNA species, and progressive loss of
lower motor neurons regulated by p53.

;;CD36 ANTIGEN-LIKE 1; CD36L1;;
CD36 AND LIMPII ANALOGOUS 1; CLA1;;
SCAVENGER RECEPTOR, CLASS B, TYPE I; SRBI; SRB1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Scavenger receptor class B type I (SRBI) mediates the bidirectional
transfer of cholesterol between cells and high density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL) (summary by Vergeer et al., 2011).

CLONING

Using degenerate PCR, Calvo and Vega (1993) isolated a novel sequence
closely related to both the CD36 thrombospondin/collagen receptor
(173510) and to lysosomal integral membrane protein II (LIMPII; 602257).
This novel gene was termed CLA1 for 'CD36 and LIMPII analogous-1.' Calvo
and Vega (1993) isolated 2 alternatively spliced CLA1 cDNAs predicting
proteins of 409 and 509 amino acids from a human placenta cDNA library.
Calvo and Vega (1993) stated that the full-length CLA1 sequence predicts
a glycoprotein having 2 transmembrane domains, 2 short cytoplasmic
tails, and a large extracellular loop. They used immunofluorescence to
show that the protein is found on the plasma membrane. Northern blot
analysis revealed a 2.9-kb mRNA in several cell lines.

MAPPING

Calvo et al. (1995) used PCR analysis of human-hamster hybrids to map
the CD36L1 gene to human chromosome 12. They stated that CD36, CD36L1,
and CD36L2 represent a gene family, but that this family is not
clustered in the genome; these genes map to chromosomes 7, 12, and 4,
respectively. Cao et al. (1997) mapped the SCARB1 gene to 12q24.2-qter
by FISH. From the mapping of a QTL for internal carotid artery intimal
medial thickness with chromosome 12 to a site 161 cM from 12pter, it was
found by Fox et al. (2004) that SCARB1 is in close proximity.

GENE FUNCTION

High density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) are
cholesterol transport particles whose plasma concentrations are directly
(in the case of LDL) and inversely (in the case of HDL) correlated with
risk for atherosclerosis. LDL metabolism involves cellular uptake and
degradation of the entire particle by a well-characterized receptor
(606945). HDL, in contrast, selectively delivers its cholesterol, but
not protein, to cells. Acton et al. (1996) showed that the mouse HDL
receptor involved in this selective delivery of cholesterol is the class
B scavenger receptor they referred to as SR-BI. This receptor binds HDL
with high affinity, is expressed primarily in liver and nonplacental
steroidogenic tissues, and mediates selective cholesterol uptake by a
mechanism distinct from the classic LDL receptor pathway. The authors
distinguished this receptor activity from that of other HDL-binding
proteins (e.g., 142695). By analogy with the LDL system, a key missing
element in the study of HDL metabolism had been a well-defined HDL
receptor, which could give a molecular and cellular handle on the
system. The class B type I scavenger receptor was the first molecularly
well-characterized HDL receptor.

The murine scavenger receptor type B class I (SRBI) has affinity for
high density lipoproteins (HDLs) and mediates the selective uptake of
cholesterol esters. Murao et al. (1997) noted that SRBI shares 81%
sequence identity with the longer (509 amino acid) form of human CLA1.
By Northern blot analysis, Murao et al. (1997) demonstrated that the
2.9-kb CLA1 message is expressed most strongly in human adrenal gland
and also in liver and testis. Murao et al. (1997) suggested that CLA1,
like SRBI, could play a role in the metabolism of HDL. However, CLA1 was
also expressed in monocytes and, like SRBI, recognized modified forms of
low density lipoproteins as well as native LDL and anionic
phospholipids. Murao et al. (1997) found that CLA1 bound selectively to
apoptotic thymocytes. Murao et al. (1997) suggested that CLA1 may have 2
distinct roles, functioning both as a mediator of HDL uptake in the
liver and steroidogenic tissues, and having an alternative role in
leukocytes.

Murao et al. (1997) and Cao et al. (1997) demonstrated that SRBI is
expressed in humans at high levels in precisely those tissues that
previously had been shown to exhibit the bulk of selective uptake of HDL
cholesterol in vivo. The temporal and spatial expression of SRBI during
murine embryogenesis was consistent with a role of SRBI in delivering
cholesterol to the developing fetus. Additional correlative evidence of
a role of SRBI in HDL cholesterol metabolism came from studies of the
effects on SRBI expression of hormones, which induce or suppress steroid
hormone synthesis. To address the role of SRBI in HDL cholesterol
homeostasis, mice were generated bearing an SRBI promoter mutation that
resulted in decreased expression of the receptor in homozygous mutant
mice (Varban et al., 1998). Hepatic expression of the receptor was
reduced by 53% with a corresponding increase in total plasma cholesterol
levels of 50 to 70%, attributable almost exclusively to elevated plasma
HDL. In addition to the increased HDL cholesteryl esters, HDL
phospholipids and apoA1 (107680) levels were elevated and there was an
increase in HDL particle size in mutant mice. Metabolic studies using
HDL-bearing nondegradable radiolabels in both the protein and lipid
components demonstrated that reduced hepatic SRBI expression by half was
associated with a decrease of 47% in selective uptake of cholesteryl
esters by the liver, and a corresponding reduction of 53% in selective
removal of HDL cholesteryl esters from plasma. Taken together, these
findings strongly supported a pivotal role for hepatic SRBI expression
in regulating plasma HDL levels and indicated that SRBI is the major
molecular mediating selective cholesteryl ester uptake by the liver. The
inverse correlation between plasma HDL levels and atherosclerosis
further suggests that SRBI may influence the development of coronary
artery disease. See Krieger (1998) for a comparison of the HDL and LDL
receptor systems.

Ikemoto et al. (2000) identified an SRBI-associated protein from rat
liver membrane extracts by using an affinity chromatography technique.
The protein contains 4 PDZ domains (see 603199 for a discussion of PDZ)
and associates with the C terminus of rat SRBI by using its N-terminal
first PDZ domain; see 603831.

Scarselli et al. (2002) determined that SCARB1 is a receptor for
hepatitis C virus glycoprotein E2. Binding between SCARB1 and E2 was
found to be independent of the genotype of the viral isolate.

Using a genomewide RNA interference screen in Drosophila macrophage-like
cells using Mycobacterium fortuitum, Philips et al. (2005) identified
factors required for general phagocytosis, as well as those needed
specifically for mycobacterial infection. One specific factor, Peste
(Pes), is a CD36 family member required for uptake of mycobacteria, but
not E. coli or S. aureus. Moreover, mammalian class B scavenger
receptors (SRs) conferred uptake of bacteria into nonphagocytic cells,
with SR-BI and SR-BII (602257) uniquely mediating uptake of M.
fortuitum, which suggests a conserved role for class B SRs in pattern
recognition and innate immunity.

Vishnyakova et al. (2006) found that transfection of embryonic kidney
and HeLa cell lines with CLA1 and its splice variant, CLA2, enhanced
uptake of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
Lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid competed with E. coli K12 for
CLA1 and CLA2 binding. Transmission electron microscopy and confocal
microscopy analyses revealed cytosolic accumulation of bacteria in cells
overexpressing CLA1/CLA2. In the presence of antibiotics, E. coli K12
survived and replicated intracellularly, but synthetic amphipathic
helical peptides prevented E. coli K12 invasion. Peritoneal macrophages
from mice lacking Cla1/Cla2 showed reduced bacterial uptake, as well as
decreased bacterial cytosolic invasion, ubiquitination, and proteasome
mobilization, whereas bacterial lysosomal accumulation was unaffected.
Vishnyakova et al. (2006) proposed that these CLA1/CLA2-mediated
intracellular events may facilitate infection with certain intracellular
pathogens, such as hepatitis C virus, and/or represent a mechanism of
pathogen recognition, ubiquitination, and degradation.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 77 subjects who were heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia
(143890), Tai et al. (2003) examined the association of plasma lipid
concentrations with 3 common polymorphisms of the SRBI gene, which is a
candidate gene involved in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Two
polymorphisms, one in exon 1 and one in exon 8, were associated with
variation in plasma concentrations of fasting triglyceride. In addition,
the exon 8 polymorphism was associated with change in lipoprotein
levels. In agreement with animal studies, the data suggested a role for
SRBI in the metabolism of apolipoprotein B (APOB; 107730)-containing
lipoproteins in humans. Tai et al. (2003) suggested that this pathway
may constitute a backup mechanism to LDL receptor-mediated pathways for
the catabolism of these lipoproteins, and could be particularly relevant
in subjects with high levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins, such as
those occurring in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

Decreased HDL cholesterol and raised triglyceride levels are well known
risk factors for atherosclerosis. McCarthy et al. (2003) examined
polymorphisms in the HDL receptor gene SCARB1 in 371 white patients with
coronary artery disease to determine their association with plasma
lipids. They found an association between a combination of genotypes in
women but not in men. McCarthy et al. (2003) concluded that genetic
variants in SCARB1 may be an important determinant of abnormal
lipoproteins in women and confer particular susceptibility to coronary
artery disease. They referred to the findings of Herrington et al.
(2002) that a differential response of HDL cholesterol to hormone
replacement therapy is dependent on the presence of genetic variants of
the estrogen receptor gene (133430.0004), and suggested that SCARB1
variants may also modulate the effect of hormone replacement therapy on
plasma lipid levels in women.

Acton et al. (1999) reported 3 common polymorphisms associated with
plasma lipids and body mass index. Osgood et al. (2003) hypothesized
that diabetic status may interact with these polymorphisms in
determining plasma lipid concentrations and particle size. They
evaluated this hypothesis in 2,463 nondiabetic (49% men) and 187
diabetic (64% men) participants in the Framingham Study. After
multivariate adjustment, they found a consistent association between the
exon 8 polymorphism and high density lipoprotein cholesterol
concentration and particle size. Interaction effects were not
significant for exon 8 and intron 5 polymorphisms. However, Osgood et
al. (2003) found statistically significant interactions between SCARB1
exon 1 genotypes and type 2 diabetes (125853), indicating that diabetic
subjects with the less common allele have lower lipid concentrations.
The authors concluded that SCARB1 gene variation modulates the lipid
profile, particularly in type 2 diabetes, contributing to the metabolic
abnormalities in these subjects.

Perez-Martinez et al. (2005) studied if a G-to-A polymorphism in exon 1
of the SCARB1 gene modifies the insulin sensitivity to dietary fat. They
studied 59 healthy volunteers. Steady-state plasma glucose after a
monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) diet was lower in G/A compared with
G/G subjects. Plasma nonesterified free fatty acid values were lower in
subjects carrying the less common A allele for all the diet periods. The
authors concluded that carriers of the G/A genotype have significant
increases in insulin sensitivity after a MUFA-rich diet compared with
G/G individuals. There were no homozygotes for the A allele.

Teslovich et al. (2010) performed a genomewide association study for
plasma lipids in more than 100,000 individuals of European ancestry and
reported 95 significantly associated loci (P = less than 5 x 10(-8)),
with 59 showing genomewide significant association with lipid traits for
the first time. The newly reported associations included SNPs near known
lipid regulators (e.g., CYP7A1, 118455; NPC1L1, 608010; and SCARB1) as
well as in scores of loci not previously implicated in lipoprotein
metabolism. The 95 loci contributed not only to normal variation in
lipid traits but also to extreme lipid phenotypes and had an impact on
lipid traits in 3 non-European populations (East Asians, South Asians,
and African Americans).

Vergeer et al. (2011) identified a missense mutation, P297S
(601040.0001), in the SCARB1 gene that was associated with elevated HDL
cholesterol levels (see HDLCQ6, 610762) but no other differences in
lipid profile parameters, atherosclerosis, or carotoid intima-media
thickness. However, carriers of the P297S variant showed decreased
platelet aggregation and a reduction in cholesterol efflux from
monocyte-macrophages. Carriers also had decreased adrenal
steroidogenesis. Khovidhunkit (2011) commented that the study by Vergeer
et al. (2011) did not distinguish whether the diminished adrenal
function in the carriers of the P297S mutation was primary or secondary,
and suggested measuring corticotropin levels to differentiate. Vergeer
et al. (2011) replied that there was no difference in median
corticotropin levels between the 15 P297S carriers and the 15
noncarriers, indicating that there was no pituitary defect. Vergeer et
al. (2011) suggested that the P297S mutation in the SCARB1 cholesterol
transporter directly impairs the adrenal uptake of cholesterol as a
substrate for steriodogenesis, leading to a primary defect in adrenal
function in human carriers.

Brunham et al. (2011) sequenced the SCARB1 gene in 120 Caucasian
probands with plasma HDL cholesterol levels at or above the 90th
percentile adjusted for age and gender, and in 80 Caucasian individuals
with HDLC below the 10th percentile, with no other lipid abnormalities.
In 2 probands with high HDLC, they identified 2 missense mutations
(601040.0002 and 601040.0003) that segregated with HDL cholesterol
levels in each family and were not found in the 80 individuals with low
HDLC levels or in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes databases.

ANIMAL MODEL

Miettinen et al. (2001) generated Scarb1 knockout mice and observed that
null females had abnormal HDLs, ovulated dysfunctional oocytes, and were
infertile. Fertility was restored when the structure and/or quantity of
abnormal HDL was altered by inactivating the Apoa1 gene or administering
the cholesterol-lowering drug probucol. Miettinen et al. (2001)
suggested that abnormal lipoprotein metabolism can cause infertility in
mice and may contribute to some forms of human female infertility.

SCARB1, PRO297SER

Among a cohort of 162 unrelated white participants with an HDL
cholesterol level above the 95th percentile (see HDLCQ6, 610762),
Vergeer et al. (2011) identified an individual who carried a C-to-T
transition at nucleotide 889 of the SCARB1 gene, resulting in a
proline-to-serine substitution at codon 297 (P297S). This mutation was
not found in 150 normolipidemic controls. The proline at this position
is highly conserved across species. Vergeer et al. (2011) investigated
18 further carrier members of the proband's family and compared them to
36 family noncarrier controls matched according to BMI, sex, and age on
an aggregate basis. Carriers had significantly increased HDL cholesterol
levels (70.4 mg per deciliter vs 53.4 mg per deciliter in noncarriers; p
less than 0.001) but no significant differences in levels of other
plasma lipids. Vergeer et al. (2011) found no difference in the
prevalence of cardiovascular disease between carriers and noncarriers,
and no difference in carotid intima-media thickness. Among carriers,
Vergeer et al. (2011) identified decreased platelet aggregation in
response to different agonists compared with noncarriers, as well as
decreased adrenal steroidogenesis. Cholesterol uptake from HDL by
primary murine hepatocytes that expressed mutant SRB1 protein was
reduced by 56% of that of hepatocytes expressing wildtype SRB1 (p less
than 0.001).

In a 50-year-old Caucasian man with HDL cholesterol (HDLC) levels above

Brunham et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a 776A-G
transversion in the SCARB1 gene, resulting in a thr175-to-ala (T175A)
substitution at a highly conserved residue in the large extracellular
loop. The mutation was present in the proband's 2 sons, who also had
HDLC levels above the 95th percentile, and in the proband's brother,
whose HDLC level was at the 71st percentile but who also had
hypertension and was taking medication that might influence the
phenotype. The mutation was not found in other family members with HDLC
levels less than the 95th percentile, in 80 unrelated Caucasian
individuals with HDLC levels below the 10th percentile, or in the dbSNP
or 1000 Genomes databases.

In a 51-year-old Caucasian man with HDL cholesterol levels above the

Brunham et al. (2011) identified heterozygosity for a 588C-T transition
in the SCARB1 gene, resulting in a ser112-to-phe (S112F) substitution at
a highly conserved residue in the large extracellular loop. The mutation
was not found in 80 unrelated Caucasian individuals with HDLC levels
below the 10th percentile, or in the dbSNP or 1000 Genomes databases.
However, the proband's 76-year-old mother, who was also heterozygous for
S112F, had an HDLC level in the 15th percentile, with early-onset
cerebrovascular disease at 55 years of age as well as later coronary
artery disease. Analysis of 3 genes known to be associated with low HDLC
levels revealed that his mother also carried a heterozygous missense
mutation in the ABCA1 gene (V2091I), suggesting that ABCA1 mutations may
be dominant to SCARB1 mutations with respect to HDLC.

612252	TITLE *612252 C-TYPE LECTIN DOMAIN FAMILY 9, MEMBER A; CLEC9A
;;DENDRITIC CELL NATURAL KILLER LECTIN GROUP RECEPTOR 1; DNGR1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

CLEC9A is a group V C-type lectin-like receptor (CTLR) that functions as
an activation receptor and is expressed on myeloid lineage cells
(Huysamen et al., 2008).

CLONING

By sequence analysis of the dectin-1 (CLEC7A; 606264) cluster on
chromosome 12, Huysamen et al. (2008) identified CLEC9A. The predicted
type II transmembrane CTLR contains 241 amino acids and has a calculated
molecular mass of 30 kD. It has a C-type lectin domain (CTLD), followed
by a stalk region, the transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail with
an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). The CTLD
contains 6 characteristic cysteines, but it lacks residues involved in
calcium ion coordination and carbohydrate binding. The stalk region has
2 cysteines and an N-linked glycosylation site. Flow cytometric, Western
blot, and deglycosylation analyses showed surface expression of a
glycosylated CLEC9A dimer of 40 and 45 kD under reducing conditions. The
deglycosylated dimer was approximately 30 and 35 kD. RT-PCR detected
CLEC9A expression in most human tissues examined, with highest levels in
brain, thymus, and spleen. Flow cytometric sorting and RT-PCR analysis
detected CLEC9A expression predominantly in BDCA3-positive dendritic
cells (DCs), but also in a monocyte subset. Huysamen et al. (2008) also
cloned mouse Clec9a, which shares 53% amino acid identity with human
CLEC9A. Mouse Clec9a was expressed at the cell surface, but unlike human
CLEC9A, it was not glycosylated and was expressed as a monomer.

GENE FUNCTION

Huysamen et al. (2008) expressed human CLEC9A in mouse fibroblasts and
macrophages and showed that crosslinking of CLEC9A led to receptor
internalization or endocytosis, but not phagocytosis. CLEC9A-positive
macrophages stimulated with zymosan expressed TNF (191160) via SYK
(600085). Huysamen et al. (2008) concluded that CLEC9A is an activation
receptor.

In mice, Sancho et al. (2008) showed that Clec9a, which they called
Dngr1, could deliver antigens to Cd8a (186910)-positive DCs for MHC
class I cross-presentation and promotion of tumor immunity. In humans,
they found that DNGR1 was an endocytic receptor expressed uniformly on
BDCA3-positive DCs.

Sancho et al. (2009) showed that CD8A-positive DCs use CLEC9A to
recognize a preformed signal that is exposed on necrotic cells. Loss or
blockade of CLEC9A did not impair the uptake of necrotic cell material
by CD8A-positive DCs, but specifically reduced crosspresentation of dead
cell-associated antigens in vitro and decreased the immunogenicity of
necrotic cells in vivo. The function of CLEC9A requires a key tyrosine
residue in its intracellular tail that allows the recruitment and
activation of the tyrosine kinase SYK (600085), which is also essential
for crosspresentation of dead cell-associated antigens. Thus, Sancho et
al. (2009) concluded that CLEC9A functions as a SYK-coupled C-type
lectin receptor to mediate sensing of necrosis by the principal DC
subset involved in regulating crosspriming to cell-associated antigens.

GENE STRUCTURE

Huysamen et al. (2008) determined that the CLEC9A gene contains 6 exons
and spans approximately 13 kb. Sancho et al. (2008) stated that CLEC9A
contains 9 exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Huysamen et al. (2008) mapped the CLEC9A
gene to chromosome 12p13.31, centromeric to CLEC12B and telomeric to
CLEC1A (606782).

176882	TITLE *176882 PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE, RECEPTOR-TYPE, BETA; PTPRB
;;VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL PROTEIN-TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE; VEPTP
DESCRIPTION For background information on protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases),
see 176884.

CLONING

By screening a human brainstem cDNA library with a leukocyte common
antigen (LCA, or PTPRC; 151460) probe spanning both conserved
cytoplasmic domains, Kaplan et al. (1990) isolated clones encoding the
alpha polypeptide (PTPRA; 176884) of the receptor-type PTPases, as well
as partial clones for 2 other tyrosine phosphatases, beta (PTPRB) and
gamma (PTPRG; 176886).

By screening a human placenta cDNA library with Drosophila Ptp, Krueger
et al. (1990) cloned several PTPases, including PTPRB, which they called
PTP-beta. The deduced 1,997-amino acid protein has an N-terminal signal
peptide, followed by an extracellular receptor-like domain, a
transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic region containing a
characteristic PTPase domain. The extracellular region contains 16
repeated fibronectin (FN1; 135600) type III domains of about 90 amino
acids each, followed by a putative proline-rich hinge region before the
transmembrane segment. Krueger et al. (1990) also identified a PTP-beta
splice variant predicted to alter the extracellular region of the
protein.

GENE FUNCTION

Using the cytoplasmic segment of human PTP-beta expressed in E. coli,
Krueger et al. (1990) confirmed that PTP-beta had robust PTPase activity
against phosphorylated test substrates.

MAPPING

Using a cDNA probe for in situ hybridization, Harder et al. (1992)
mapped the PTPRB gene to chromosome 12q15-q21.

ANIMAL MODEL

Dominguez et al. (2007) replaced mouse Veptp with a reporter gene and
found that Veptp was expressed in endothelium and in the developing
outflow tract of the heart, with later expression in developing heart
valves. Embryonic Veptp-null mice died due to a variety of angiogenic
defects in the embryo and yolk sac, including failure of remodeling of
the vascular plexus into large veins and branched vascular networks.
Dominguez et al. (2007) concluded that VEPTP is essential for
cardiovascular development and proposed that its continued expression in
adult mouse suggests that it may have a role in vascular homeostasis and
may be involved in pathologic angiogenesis of tumors.

607204	TITLE *607204 PUMILIO, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, 1; PUM1
;;KIAA0099
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing cDNAs randomly selected from a cDNA library derived from
the human immature myeloid cell line KG-1, Nagase et al. (1995) isolated
a cDNA encoding PUM1, a human homolog of the Drosophila Pumilio protein,
which they designated KIAA0099. The predicted 1,186-amino acid KIAA0099
protein is 42.1% identical to Drosophila Pumilio over an 875-amino acid
region . Northern blot analysis detected expression of KIAA0099 in all
tissues tested.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Wang et al. (2002) determined the structure of the RNA-binding domain of
human PUM1 bound to a high-affinity RNA ligand. The RNA binds the
concave surface of the molecule, where each of the protein's 8 repeats
makes contact with a different RNA base via 3 amino acid side chains at
conserved positions. Wang et al. (2002) mutated these 3 side chains in 1
repeat, thereby altering the sequence specificity of PUM1. They
concluded that the high affinity and specificity of the PUM homology
domain for RNA is achieved using multiple copies of a simple repeated
motif.

MAPPING

By analysis of human/rodent hybrid cell lines, Nagase et al. (1995)
mapped the KIAA0099 gene to chromosome 1.

;;PFKFB, CARDIAC
DESCRIPTION Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate is an intracellular regulatory molecule that
controls glycolysis in all eukaryotic tissues by integrating hormonal
and metabolic signals. The synthesis and degradation of fructose
2,6-bisphosphate are catalyzed by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (EC
2.7.1.105) and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.46), respectively.
In liver, these 2 activities belong to the same polypeptide encoded by
the gene PFKFB1, which also encodes the muscle isozyme and is located on
the X chromosome (311790). The heart isozyme is encoded by a separate
gene, which Hilliker et al. (1991) showed, by means of probes generated
by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to be located on 1q31 in the
human and 13q24-q25 in the rat. The mapping was done by analysis of
somatic cell hybrids and followed by in situ hybridization.

;;HP1, DROSOPHILA, HOMOLOG OF, ALPHA;;
HP1-ALPHA;;
HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1; HP1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) is a methyl-lysine binding protein
localized at heterochromatin sites. HP1 mediates gene silencing (summary
by Bannister et al., 2001).

CLONING

At the nuclear envelope in higher eukaryotic cells, the nuclear lamina
and the heterochromatin are adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane.
Using the nucleoplasmic N terminus of lamin B receptor (LBR; 600024), an
integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane, as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Ye and Worman (1996)
isolated 2 chromodomain proteins that are homologs of Drosophila HP1.
One of these proteins, CBX5, contains 191 amino acids and was previously
cloned by Saunders et al. (1993). CBX5 shows 65% sequence similarity
with the other identified protein, CBX3 (604477).

Maison et al. (2011) noted that HP1-alpha has an N-terminal
chromodomain, followed by a hinge region and a C-terminal chromoshadow
domain.

GENE FUNCTION

Ye and Worman (1996) found that LBR fusion proteins bound to CBX3 and
CBX5 proteins synthesized by in vitro translation and present in cell
lysates. LBR also coimmunoprecipitated the CBX proteins from cell
extracts. Ye and Worman (1996) suggested that the interaction between
LBR and the chromodomain proteins may explain, in part, the association
of heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane.

Lachner et al. (2001) showed that mammalian methyltransferases that
selectively methylate histone H3 (see 602810) on lysine-9 (Suv39h
HMTases; see SUV39H1, 300254) generate a binding site for HP1 proteins,
a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene
silencing and supranucleosomal chromatin structure. High-affinity in
vitro recognition of a methylated histone H3 peptide by HP1 requires a
functional chromodomain; thus, the HP1 chromodomain is a specific
interaction motif for the methyl epitope on lysine-9 of histone H3. In
vivo, heterochromatin association of HP1 proteins is lost in Suv39h
double-null primary mouse fibroblasts but is restored after
reintroduction of a catalytically active SUV39H1 HMTase. Lachner et al.
(2001) concluded that their data define a molecular mechanism through
which the SUV39H-HP1 methylation system can contribute to the
propagation of heterochromatic subdomains in native chromatin.

Bannister et al. (2001) demonstrated that HP1 can bind with high
affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine-9 but not at lysine-4. They
identified the chromodomain of HP1 as its methyl-lysine-binding domain.
A point mutation in the chromodomain, which destroys the gene silencing
activity of HP1 in Drosophila, abolished methyl-lysine-binding activity.
Genetic and biochemical analysis in S. pombe showed that the methylase
activity of Clr4 (the SUV39H1 homolog) is necessary for the correct
localization of Swi6 (the HP1 equivalent) at centromeric heterochromatin
and for gene silencing. Bannister et al. (2001) concluded that these
results provide a stepwise model for the formation of a
transcriptionally silent heterochromatin: SUV39H1 places a methyl marker
on histone H3, which is then recognized by HP1 through its chromodomain.
This model may also explain the stable inheritance of the
heterochromatic state.

Nielsen et al. (2001) demonstrated that SUV39H1 and HP1 are both
involved in the repressive functions of the retinoblastoma protein (RB1;
614041). Rb1 associates with SUV39H1 and HP1 in vivo by means of its
pocket domain. SUV39H1 cooperates with Rb to repress the cyclin E
(123837) promoter, and in fibroblasts that are disrupted for SUV39H1,
the activity of the cyclin E and cyclin A2 (123835) genes are
specifically elevated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Rb is
necessary to direct methylation of histone H3, and is necessary for
binding of HP1 to the cyclin E promoter. Nielsen et al. (2001) concluded
that the SUV39H1-HP1 complex is not only involved in heterochromatic
silencing but also has a role in repression of euchromatic genes by Rb
and perhaps other corepressor proteins.

Eukaryotic genomes are organized into discrete structural and functional
chromatin domains. Noma et al. (2001) demonstrated that distinct
site-specific histone H3 methylation patterns define euchromatic and
heterochromatic chromosomal domains within an 47-kb region of the
mating-type locus in fission yeast. H3 methylated at lysine-9, and its
interacting Swi6 protein, are strictly localized to a 20-kb silent
heterochromatic interval. In contrast, H3 methylated at lysine-4 is
specific to the surrounding euchromatic regions. Two inverted repeats
flanking the silent interval serve as boundary elements to mark the
borders between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Deletions of these
boundary elements leads to spreading of H3 lys9 methylation and Swi6
into neighboring sequences. Furthermore, the H3 lys6 methylation and
corresponding heterochromatin-associated complexes prevent H3 lys4
methylation in the silent domain.

The higher-order assembly of chromatin imposes structural organization
on the genetic information of eukaryotes and is thought to be largely
determined by posttranslational modification of histone tails. Hall et
al. (2002) studied a 20-kb silent domain at the mating-type region of S.
pombe as a model for heterochromatin formation. They found that although
histone H3 methylated at lys9 directly recruited heterochromatin protein
Swi6/HP1, the critical determinant for H3 lys9 methylation to spread in
cis to be inherited through mitosis and meiosis is Swi6 itself. The
authors demonstrated that a centromere homologous repeat present at the
silent mating-type region is sufficient for heterochromatin formation at
an ectopic site, and that its repressive capacity is mediated by
components of the RNA interference machinery. Moreover, the centromere
homologous repeat and the RNA interference machinery cooperate to
nucleate heterochromatin assembly at the endogenous mating locus but are
dispensable for its subsequent inheritance. Hall et al. (2002) concluded
that their work defines sequential requirements for the initiation and
propagation of regional heterochromatic domains.

Cheutin et al. (2003) demonstrated that maintenance of stable
heterochromatin domains in living cells involves the transient binding
and dynamic exchange of HP1 from chromatin. HP1 exchange kinetics
correlated with the condensation level of chromatin and were dependent
on the histone methyltransferase SUV39H. The chromodomain and the
chromoshadow domain of HP1 are both required for binding to native
chromatin in vivo, but they contribute differentially to binding in
euchromatin and heterochromatin. Cheutin et al. (2003) suggested that
their data argue against HP1 repression of transcription by formation of
static, higher order oligomeric networks but support a dynamic
competition model, and demonstrate that heterochromatin is accessible to
regulatory factors.

Chadwick and Willard (2003) screened over 30 histone variants, modified
histones, and nonhistone proteins for their association with or
exclusion from the Barr body. They demonstrated that HP1, histone H1
(HIST1H1B; 142711), and the high mobility group protein HMGIY (HMGA1;
600701) were elevated at the territory of the inactive X chromosome (Xi)
in interphase in human cell lines, but only when the Xi chromatin was
heteropycnotic, implicating each as a component of the Barr body.
However, virtually all other candidate proteins involved in establishing
heterochromatin and gene silencing were notably absent from the Barr
body, suggesting that the Barr body may represent a discrete subnuclear
compartment that is not freely accessible to most chromatin proteins. A
similar dichotomous pattern of association or exclusion describes the
spatial relationship of a number of specific histone methylation
patterns in relation to the Barr body. The authors hypothesized that the
Xi may adopt a distinct chromatin configuration in interphase nuclei,
consistent with a mechanism by which HP1, through histone H3 (H3F2;
142780) lysine-9 methylation, recognizes and assists in maintaining
heterochromatin and gene silencing at the human Xi.

Following overexpression of MIS12 (609178) in HeLa cells, Obuse et al.
(2004) immunoprecipitated several proteins, including HP1-alpha, that
interacted with MIS12 in a kinetochore-associated complex. Both
HP1-alpha and HP1-gamma (CBX3) interacted directly with MIS12 and
C20ORF172 (609175). Exclusion chromatography revealed 3 peaks containing
MIS12 and C20ORF172, but only the middle peak, which had a mass of 669
kD, contained HP1-alpha. Using HP1 RNA interference (RNAi), Obuse et al.
(2004) found that HP1-alpha and HP1-gamma were functionally redundant.
In double HP1 RNAi, the integrity of kinetochores was abolished and
micronuclei were formed. Obuse et al. (2004) hypothesized that the firm
association of heterochromatic HP1 with the MIS12 complex may be a
fundamental feature of human kinetochore formation.

Fischle et al. (2005) demonstrated that HP1-alpha, HP1-beta (604511),
and HP1-gamma (604477) are released from chromatin during the M phase of
the cell cycle even though trimethylation levels of histone H3 lys9
remain unchanged. However, the additional transient modification of
histone H3 by phosphorylation of ser10 next to the more stable
methyl-lys9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their binding
sites. Inhibition or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B (604970),
which phosphorylates histone H3 on ser10, causes retention of HP1
proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting that H3 ser10
phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from chromatin
in M phase. Fischle et al. (2005) concluded that their findings
establish a regulatory mechanism of protein-protein interactions,
through a combinatorial readout of 2 adjacent posttranslational
modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic phosphorylation mark.

Hirota et al. (2005) showed that antibodies against mitotic chromosomal
antigens that are associated with human autoimmune diseases specifically
recognize H3 molecules that are modified by both trimethylation of lys9
and phosphorylation of ser10 (H3K9me3S10ph). The generation of
H3K9me3S10ph depends on Suv39h (see 300254) and Aurora B (604970), and
occurs at pericentric heterochromatin during mitosis in different
eukaryotes. Most HP1 typically dissociates from chromosomes during
mitosis, but if phosphorylation of H3 ser10 is inhibited, HP1 remains
chromosome-bound throughout mitosis. H3 phosphorylation by Aurora B is
therefore part of a 'methyl/phos switch' mechanism that displaces HP1
and perhaps other proteins from mitotic heterochromatin.

Smallwood et al. (2007) demonstrated that DNMT1 (126375) could interact
with HP1-alpha, HP1-beta, and HP1-gamma in a human colon carcinoma cell
line, resulting in stimulation of DNMT1 methyltransferase activity. The
HP1 proteins were sufficient to target DNMT1 activity in vivo, and
HP1-dependent repression required DNMT1. Smallwood et al. (2007)
demonstrated that HP1-alpha and HP1-beta were recruited to the survivin
(BIRC5; 603352) promoter in a DNMT1-dependent manner. They concluded
that direct interactions between HP1 proteins and DNMT1 mediate
silencing of euchromatic genes.

Dawson et al. (2009) showed that human JAK2 (147796) is present in the
nucleus of hematopoietic cells and directly phosphorylates tyr41 (Y41)
on histone H3 (see 601128). HP1-alpha, but not HP1-beta, specifically
binds to this region of H3 through its chromo-shadow domain.
Phosphorylation of H3Y41 by JAK2 prevents this binding. Inhibition of
JAK2 activity in human leukemic cells decreases both the expression of
hematopoietic oncogene LMO2 (180385) and the phosphorylation of H3Y41 at
its promoter, while simultaneously increasing the binding of HP1-alpha
at the same site. Dawson et al. (2009) concluded that their results
identified a previously unrecognized nuclear role for JAK2 in the
phosphorylation of H3Y41 and revealed a direct mechanistic link between
2 genes, JAK2 and LMO2, involved in normal hematopoiesis and leukemia.

Maison et al. (2011) found that mouse Hp1-alpha bound RNA that
originated from the major satellite repeat region of mouse centromeres.
Binding occurred predominantly with RNA transcribed in the forward
orientation. Mutation analysis revealed that the hinge domain of
Hp1-alpha was required for RNA binding. Mass spectrometry revealed that
several lysines within the hinge region were modified by sumoylation and
could accept Sumo1 (601912), Sumo2 (603042), or Sumo3 (602231).
Sumoylation of Hp1-alpha was required for binding major RNAs, and RNA
binding promoted targeting of Hp1-alpha to pericentric heterochromatin.
Subsequent H3K9 methylation appeared to stabilize Hp1-alpha at
pericentric heterochromatin.

The histone methylase SUV39H1 (300254) participates in the
trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine-9 (H3K9me3; see 601128), a
modification that provides binding sites for HP1-alpha and promotes
transcriptional silencing. This pathway was initially associated with
heterochromatin formation and maintenance but can also contribute to the
regulation of euchromatic genes. Allan et al. (2012) proposed that the
SUV39H1-H3K9me3-HP1-alpha pathway participates in maintaining the
silencing of TH1 loci, ensuring TH2 lineage stability. In TH2 cells that
are deficient in SUV39H1, the ratio between trimethylated and acetylated
H3K9 is impaired, and the binding of HP1-alpha at the promoters of
silenced TH1 genes is reduced. Despite showing normal differentiation,
both SUV39H1-deficient TH2 cells and HP1-alpha-deficient TH2 cells, in
contrast to wildtype cells, expressed TH1 genes when recultured under
conditions that drive differentiation into TH1 cells. In a mouse model
of TH2-driven allergic asthma, the chemical inhibition or loss of
SUV39H1 skewed T-cell responses towards TH1 responses and decreased the
lung pathology.

603721	TITLE *603721 UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME E2L 3; UBE2L3
;;UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING ENZYME UBCH7; UBCH7
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s or UBCs) are essential components of
the posttranslational protein ubiquitination pathway, mediating the
transfer of activated ubiquitin to substrate proteins.

CLONING

The S. cerevisiae UBC1, UBC4, and UBC5 enzymes appear to participate in
the degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins. Human UBE2L1
(600012) is a homolog of yeast UBC4 and UBC5. By screening a genomic
library with a UBE2L1 probe, Moynihan et al. (1996) isolated clones
corresponding to a novel gene, UBE2L3.

Nuber et al. (1996) cloned human keratinocyte cDNAs encoding UBE2L3,
which they referred to as UBCH7. The predicted 154-amino acid protein
has 64% sequence similarity to UBCH5. UBCH7 efficiently mediated E6AP
(UBE3A; 601623)-dependent ubiquitination in an in vitro assay.

By RT-PCR, Moynihan et al. (1998) determined that UBE2L3 is expressed as
4 mRNAs that differ in the length of the 3-prime untranslated region
(UTR). Sequence comparisons revealed that the human and mouse UBE2L3
cDNAs share 97% DNA sequence identity in the coding region and 93%
identity for 287 nucleotides extending into the 3-prime UTR. The
predicted mouse and human UBE2L3 proteins are identical.

GENE STRUCTURE

Moynihan et al. (1996) demonstrated that the UBE2L3 and UBE2L1 genes are
identical except that the UBE2L1 gene is intronless, while the UBE2L3
coding sequence is interrupted by 3 introns. Moynihan et al. (1998)
determined that the UBE2L3 gene spans approximately 57 kb.

MAPPING

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids and by FISH, Moynihan et al. (1996)
mapped the UBE2L3 gene to chromosome 22q11.2-q13.1. They also mapped a
pseudogene, UBE2L2, to 12q12. Ardley et al. (1997) found that another
pseudogene, UBE2L4, was located at 19q13.1-q13.2.

GENE FUNCTION

Shimura et al. (2001) hypothesized that alpha-synuclein (163890) and
parkin (602544) interact functionally, namely, that parkin ubiquitinates
alpha-synuclein normally and that this process is altered in autosomal
recessive Parkinson disease (600116). Shimura et al. (2001) identified a
protein complex in normal human brain that includes parkin as the E3
ubiquitin ligase, UBCH7 as its associated E2 ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme, and a novel 22-kD glycosylated form of alpha-synuclein
(alpha-Sp22) as its substrate. In contrast to normal parkin, mutant
parkin associated with autosomal recessive Parkinson disease failed to
bind alpha-Sp22. In an in vitro ubiquitination assay, alpha-Sp22 was
modified by normal, but not mutant, parkin into polyubiquitinated, high
molecular weight species. Accordingly, alpha-Sp22 accumulated in a
nonubiquitinated form in parkin-deficient Parkinson disease brains.
Shimura et al. (2001) concluded that alpha-Sp22 is a substrate for
parkin's ubiquitin ligase activity in normal human brain and that loss
of parkin function causes pathologic accumulation of alpha-Sp22. These
findings demonstrated a critical biochemical reaction between the 2
Parkinson disease-linked gene products and suggested that this reaction
underlies the accumulation of ubiquitinated alpha-synuclein in
conventional Parkinson disease.

Carrano et al. (2009) identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase Wwp1 (602307)
as a positive regulator of life span in C. elegans in response to
dietary restriction. Overexpression of Wwp1 in worms extended life span
by up to 20% under conditions of ad libitum feeding. Conversely,
reduction of Wwp1 completely suppressed the extended longevity of
diet-restricted animals. The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc18,
which is homologous to human UBE2L3, interacted with Wwp1 and was
required for Wwp1 ubiquitin ligase activity and the extended longevity
of worms overexpressing Wwp1. Carrano et al. (2009) concluded that Wwp1
and Ubc18 function to ubiquitinate substrates that regulate longevity
induced by diet restriction.

Wenzel et al. (2011) showed that, unlike many ubiquitin-conjugating
enzymes (E2s) that transfer ubiquitin with RINGs, UBCH7 lacks intrinsic
ubiquitin ligase (E3)-independent reactivity with lysine, explaining its
preference for HECTs. Despite lacking lysine reactivity, UBCH7 exhibits
activity with the RING-in-between-RING (RBR) family of E3s that includes
parkin (602544) and human homolog of ariadne (HHARI; 605624). Found in
all eukaryotes, RBRs regulate processes such as translation and immune
signaling. RBRs contain a canonical C3HC4-type RING, followed by 2
conserved cys/his-rich zinc-binding domains, in-between-RING (IBR) and
RING2 domains, which together define this E3 family. Wenzel et al.
(2011) showed that RBRs function like RING/HECT hybrids: they bind E2s
via a RING domain, but transfer ubiquitin through an obligate
thioester-linked ubiquitin, requiring a conserved cysteine residue in
RING2. Wenzel et al. (2011) concluded that their results defined the
functional cadre of E3s for UBCH7, an E2 involved in cell proliferation
and immune function, and indicated a novel mechanism for an entire class
of E3s.

612962	TITLE *612962 DYNACTIN 5; DCTN5
;;p25
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Dynactin (see 601143) is a multimeric protein essential for
minus-end-directed transport driven by the microtubule-based motor
dynein (see DYNC1H1; 600112). DCTN5 is a subunit of the pointed-end
subcomplex of dynactin that is thought to interact with membranous cargo
(Parisi et al., 2004).

CLONING

Eckley et al. (1999) identified Dctn5, which they called p25, as a
component of the pointed-end dynactin subcomplex in bovine brain. By
database analysis, they identified mouse p25, which encodes a 182-amino
acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 20.1 kD. Eckley et al.
(1999) also identified p25 orthologs in fly and worm.

By searching databases for proteins containing an isoleucine-patch motif
predicted to adopt a left-handed parallel beta-helix fold, Parisi et al.
(2004) identified mouse p25.

MAPPING

Hartz (2009) mapped the DCTN5 gene to chromosome 16p12.2 based on an
alignment of the DCTN5 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK027387) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

607096	TITLE *607096 SOLUTE CARRIER FAMILY 22 (URATE TRANSPORTER), MEMBER 12; SLC22A12
;;ORGANIC ANION TRANSPORTER 4-LIKE; OAT4L;;
URATE TRANSPORTER 1; URAT1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The SLC22A12 gene encodes URAT1, a renal urate-anion exchanger that
regulates blood urate levels.

CLONING

Enomoto et al. (2002) isolated a SLC22A12 cDNA from a human kidney cDNA
library. The cDNA, which they called URAT1 for 'urate transporter-1,'
corresponds to a gene of 2,642 basepairs encoding a protein of 555 amino
acids that is 42% identical to OAT4 (SLC22A11; 607097). The hydropathy
plot predicts 12 membrane-spanning domains in URAT1, which are similar
to those in members of the OAT family. URAT1 has 3 consensus sequences
for N-glycosylation and 2 cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase
phosphorylation sites. High stringency Northern analysis revealed
predominant expression of URAT1 mRNA in the human adult and fetal
kidney, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that URAT1 protein is
prominent in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the renal
cortex. Under high magnification, the protein was found to be located in
the luminal membrane of the epithelium of proximal tubules but not in
that of distal tubules.

GENE FUNCTION

Enomoto et al. (2002) demonstrated that Xenopus oocytes injected with
URAT1 cRNA exhibited time-dependent transport activity of [14C]urate but
not of various typical substrates of OATs or organic cation
transporters. URAT1 was found to be a cotransporter with anions, in
particular chloride, bromide, or iodine, but not fluoride. Enomoto et
al. (2002) found that urate transport via URAT1 is inhibited selectively
by organic anions such as lactate, nicotinate, acetoacetate,
hydroxybutyrate, and succinate. Para-aminohippurate (PAH), the
representative substrate of OATs, did not exert an inhibitory effect on
urate uptake via URAT1, consistent with the observation that PAH has no
effect on the fractional excretion of urate in humans. Benzbromarone,
probenecid, phenylbutazone, sulfinpyrazone, nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs, and diuretics inhibited urate uptake.
Trans-stimulation experiments indicated that the major counteranions
that exchange for urate via URAT1 are organic anions rather than
inorganic chloride.

Thangaraju et al. (2006) found the urinary excretion of urate was
significantly elevated in Cebpd (116898) -/- mice, although expression
of Urat1 was unaltered. However, expression of the Na(+)/lactate
cotransporters Slc5a8 (608044) and Slc5a12 (612455) was almost
completely ablated in Cebpd -/- mice. Thangaraju et al. (2006) proposed
that lactate reabsorption by SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 is coupled to urate
reabsorption by URAT1 at the proximal tubule apical membrane.

MAPPING

Enomoto et al. (2002) identified a sequence representing the SLC22A12
gene within a BAC clone (GenBank GENBANK AC044790) mapping to chromosome
11q13, near the SLC22A11 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In patients with renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al. (2002) and
Tanaka et al. (2003) identified mutations in the SLC22A12 gene
(607096.0001-607096.0003).

Ichida et al. (2008) identified SLC22A12 mutations in 66 of 71 71
Japanese patients with hypouricemia. The W258X mutation (607096.0001)
was by far the most common mutation, occurring in 93 alleles, including
31 homozygotes and 23 compound heterozygotes. A total of 13 mutations,
including 3 novel mutations, were identified (see, e.g. 607096.0005;
607096.0006). Acute renal failure and urolithiasis occurred in 21.1% and
8.5% of patients, respectively. Three patients had chronic renal
failure. By haplotype analysis, Ichida et al. (2008) found that W258X
was a founder mutation with an estimated age of 6,820 years.

HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, TRP258TER

In a 48-year-old male with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150),
Enomoto et al. (2002) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 774
within exon 4 of the SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a tryptophan-to-stop
substitution at codon 258 (W258X). This mutation was found in
homozygosity and was not identified in 180 randomly chosen control
Japanese individuals.

In 2 brothers with hereditary renal hypouricemia and exercise-induced
acute renal failure, Tanaka et al. (2003) identified homozygosity for
the W258X mutation. The parents of the sibs and all of the sibs' 5
children were heterozygous for the mutation.

By haplotype analysis of 31 Japanese individuals homozygous for the
W258X mutation, Ichida et al. (2008) estimated that the mutation is
about 6,820 years old. This mutation dates back from between the time
when the Jomon people predominated in Japan and the time when the Yayoi
people started to migrate to Japan from the Korean peninsula.

HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, THR217MET

In a patient with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al.
(2002) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 650 in exon 3 of the
SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a threonine-to-methionine substitution at
codon 217 (T217M). This mutation was found in homozygosity and was not
identified in any of 180 randomly chosen control Japanese individuals.

.0003
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, GLU298ASP

In a patient with idiopathic renal hypouricemia (220150), Enomoto et al.
(2002) identified a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 894 in exon 5 of
the SLC22A12 gene, resulting in a glutamic acid-to-aspartic acid
substitution at codon 298 (E298D). This mutation was found in
homozygosity and was not identified in any of 180 randomly chosen
control Japanese individuals.

.0004
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, LEU418ARG

In the affected member of a Japanese family with renal hypouricemia
(220150), Wakida et al. (2005) detected compound heterozygosity for
W258X (607096.0001) and for a novel mutation, a 1253T-G transversion in
the SLC22A12 gene that resulted in a leu418-to-arg (L418R) substitution
in the tenth transmembrane domain of the protein. The L418R mutation had
significantly reduced urate-transporting activities compared with
wildtype (P less than 0.05), suggesting that it is a loss-of-function
mutation.

.0005
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, ARG90HIS

In a Japanese man with renal hypouricemia (220150), Ichida et al. (2008)
identified a homozygous 269G-A transition in the SLC22A12 gene,
resulting in an arg90-to-his (R90H) substitution. Nine additional
affected individuals were compound heterozygous for R90H and W258X
(607096.0001).

.0006
HYPOURICEMIA, RENAL, 1
SLC22A12, GLY361VAL

In 2 unrelated Japanese individuals with renal hypouricemia (220150),
Ichida et al. (2008) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations
in the SLC22A12 gene: a 1082G-T transversion resulting in a
gly361-to-val (G361V) substitution, and W258X (607096.0001). In vitro
functional expression assays showed that the G361V-mutant protein had
decreased uric acid transport activity.

604580	TITLE *604580 FIBULIN 5; FBLN5
;;DEVELOPMENTAL ARTERIES AND NEURAL CREST EGF-LIKE; DANCE
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using a cDNA probe derived from signal sequence trap screening of mouse
embryonic heart, EST database screening, and 5-prime RACE, Nakamura et
al. (1999) obtained a cDNA for fibulin-5 (FBLN5), which they called
DANCE (for developmental arteries and neural crest EGF-like). The FBLN5
cDNA encodes a deduced 448-amino acid secreted protein with a molecular
mass of 66 kD. Its amino acid sequence is 94% identical to that of the
mouse Fbln5 protein. It contains 6 calcium-binding EGF-like domains, one
of which contains an RGD motif. Northern blot analysis revealed a major
transcript of 2.6 kb that is expressed predominantly in heart, ovary,
and colon but also in kidney, pancreas, testis, lung, and placenta.
FBLN5 is not detectable in brain, liver, thymus, prostate, or peripheral
blood leukocytes. FBLN5 is prominently expressed in developing arteries;
in adult vessels, its expression is largely diminished but is reinduced
in balloon-injured vessels and atherosclerotic lesions, notably in
intimal vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells.

MAPPING

By FISH, Nakamura et al. (1999) mapped the FBLN5 gene to chromosome
14q32.1. By FISH and radiation hybrid analysis, Kowal et al. (1999)
mapped the FBLN5 gene to 14q31.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakamura et al. (1999) showed that FBLN5 promotes adhesion of
endothelial cells through interaction of integrins and the RGD motif.
The authors suggested that FBLN5 is a novel vascular ligand for integrin
receptors and may play a role in vascular development and remodeling.

Mullins et al. (2007) localized the fibulin-5 protein to Bruch membrane
and to the intercapillary pillars of the choriocapillaris in normal
human donor eyes. In eyes with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD3;
608895), they localized the protein to pathologic basal deposits beneath
the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as well as in some small drusen.
Mullins et al. (2007) suggested that fibulin-5 may promote extracellular
deposit formation in macular degeneration.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Autosomal Recessive Cutis Laxa

Hereditary cutis laxa comprises a heterogeneous group of connective
tissue disorders characterized by loose skin and variable systemic
involvement. The phenotypic abnormalities observed in a fibulin-5
knockout mouse model by Nakamura et al. (2002) are reminiscent of human
autosomal recessive cutis laxa type I (ARCL1A; 219100). Both share cutis
laxa, lung emphysema, and arterial involvement. Loeys et al. (2002)
studied a large consanguineous Turkish family with 4 patients affected
by autosomal recessive cutis laxa type I, originally described by Van
Maldergem et al. (1988), and demonstrated the presence of a homozygous
missense mutation in the FBLN5 gene, resulting in a ser227-to-pro
(S227P; 604580.0001) substitution.

Hu et al. (2006) analyzed 2 disease-causing missense substitutions in
fibulin-5, C217R (604580.0010) and S227P, and found evidence for
misfolding, decreased secretion, and reduced interaction with elastin
and fibrillin-1, resulting in impaired elastic fiber development. These
findings supported the hypothesis that fibulin-5 is necessary for
elastic fiber formation by facilitating the deposition of elastin onto a
microfibrillar scaffold via direct molecular interactions.

Callewaert et al. (2013) analyzed the FBLN4 (604633), FBLN5, and LTBP4
(604710) genes in 12 families with type I ARCL and identified homozygous
mutations in the FLBN5 gene in 2 families (604580.0010 and 604580.0011).
Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in LTBP4 were identified
in 9 families (see, e.g., 604710.0005-604710.0008). No mutations were
found in the FBLN4 gene, and no mutations were detected in 1 family in
which the proband had cutis laxa and bladder diverticula without obvious
emphysema. Callewaert et al. (2013) noted that the FBLN5 and LTBP4
mutations caused a very similar phenotype associated with severe
pulmonary emphysema, in the absence of vascular tortuosity or aneurysms.
Gastointestinal and genitourinary tract involvement seemed to be more
severe in patients with LTBP4 mutations.

- Autosomal Dominant Cutis Laxa

In a patient with autosomal dominant cutis laxa (ADCL2; 614434), Markova
et al. (2003) identified a 22-kb tandem duplication in the FBLN5 gene,
resulting in a 483-bp duplication (604580.0002).

- Age-Related Macular Degeneration 3

Stone et al. (2004) studied 402 patients with age-related macular
degeneration (see ARMD3, 608895) and identified 7 different mutations in
the FBLN5 gene (604580.0003-604580.0009) that were not found in any of
429 controls (p = 0.006). Each of the 7 patients had small circular
drusen, commonly referred to as basal laminar or cuticular drusen.

Lotery et al. (2006) investigated the role of fibulin-5 in ARMD using 2
European cohorts of 805 ARMD patients and 279 controls and by
determining the functional effects of the missense mutations on
expression of the FBLN5 gene. They found 2 novel sequence changes in
ARMD patients that were absent in controls and expressed these and the
other 9 previously reported FBLN5 mutations associated with ARMD and 2
associated with autosomal recessive cutis laxa. Fibulin-5 secretion was
significantly reduced (p less than 0.001) for 4 ARMD missense mutations
and 2 cutis laxa mutations. These results suggested that some missense
mutations associated with ARMD lead to decreased fibulin-5 secretion
with a possible corresponding reduction in elastinogenesis. The studies
further demonstrated that FBLN5 mutations can be associated with
different phenotypes of ARMD (not limited to the previously described
cuticular drusen type). FBLN5 ARMD can be a cause of choroidal
neovascularization in the absence of drusen.

ANIMAL MODEL

Yanagisawa et al. (2002) generated mice deficient in fibulin-5 by
targeted disruption. Homozygous mutant mice were viable and appeared
indistinguishable from wildtype littermates during the first 4 weeks
except that slight looseness of the skin was noticeable by weaning. By
approximately 50 days of age homozygous mutant mice showed lax skin,
which progressed with age. The lungs of homozygous mutant mice were
expanded and contained dilated alveoli, which were most severe in
peripheral regions. There was tortuosity and elongation of the aorta, as
well as elongation of the ductus arteriosus. The ascending aorta
proximal to the aortic arch was elongated in fibulin-5 -/- mice, causing
the brachiocephalic trunk and left common carotid artery to be
juxtaposed. Elastin staining of skin showed a marked reduction of the
elastic fiber network surrounding hair follicles. Enlargement of the
distal airspaces of the lung was evident by 2 weeks of age in homozygous
mutant mice. This phenotype progressed with age, leading to a severe
emphysematous change with the formation of peripheral bullae in adult
mice. Elastin staining showed that elastin (130160) at the tips of the
secondary septae was fragmented and that the elastic fibers associated
with the alveolar walls were short, thickened, and disrupted in
2-week-old homozygous mice when compared with wildtype littermates.
Elastin staining of the aorta showed that elastic laminae in homozygous
mutant mice were fragmented, the defect being more severe toward the
adventitia. Despite the disorganized elastic laminae, there was no
indication of aneurysms or dissections of the medial layers of aortae in
fibulin-5 -/- mice. Other organs were normal. Disruption of the elastic
laminae of vessels was evident as early as postnatal day 1, suggesting
that the defect seen in the adult aorta of homozygous mutant mice was
not the result of degradation of intact elastic laminae by activated
inflammatory cells, but rather the consequence of an underlying
developmental defect in the final organization of the elastic fibers in
fibulin-5 -/- mice. Yanagisawa et al. (2002) performed solid-phase
binding assays to assess the biochemical interaction of fibulin-5 with
other extracellular matrix proteins. Fibulin-5 bound strongly to
tropoelastin, and this binding was completely inhibited in the presence
of EDTA, suggesting that fibulin-5 may use calcium-binding EGF-like
motifs to bind to tropoelastin. Using immunogold labeling and electron
microscopy, Yanagisawa et al. (2002) demonstrated that fibulin-5 protein
is present along the surface of elastic lamina adjacent to the
endothelial cell membrane, demonstrating that fibulin-5 is a surface
component of elastic fibers in vivo.

Nakamura et al. (2002) independently generated fibulin-5 -/- mice. The
phenotypic findings were similar to those described by Yanagisawa et al.
(2002). They showed that the aorta, lung, and skin of fibulin-5 -/- mice
contained fragmented elastin without an increase of elastase activity,
indicating defective development of elastic fibers. Fibulin-5 interacts
directly with elastic fibers in vitro, and serves as a ligand for cell
surface integrins alpha-5/beta-3, alpha-5/beta-5 (see 193210), and
alpha-9/beta-1 (see 603963) through its N-terminal domain. Nakamura et
al. (2002) postulated that fibulin-5 may provide anchorage of elastic
fibers to cells, thereby acting to stabilize and organize elastic fibers
in the skin, lung, and vasculature.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IA
FBLN5, SER227PRO

Loeys et al. (2002) studied a large consanguineous Turkish family,
originally described by Van Maldergem et al. (1988), in which 4 patients
were affected by autosomal recessive cutis laxa type I (ARCL1A; 219100)
and demonstrated homozygosity for a 998T-C transition in the FBLN5 gene.
The mutation was predicted to result in a ser227-to-pro (S227P)
substitution in the fourth cbEGF-like domain of fibulin-5 protein.
Because serine is found in this position in mouse and rat fibulin-5 as
well as in human fibulin-3, substitution for this amino acid may have
important structural and functional consequences for normal
elastogenesis.

Hu et al. (2006) showed that S227P mutant fibulin-5 is synthesized and
secreted at a reduced rate compared to wildtype. The mutant also failed
to be incorporated into elastic fibers by transfected rat lung
fibroblasts. Purified recombinant S227P fibulin-5 showed reduced
affinity for tropoelastin in solid-phase binding assays as well as
impaired association with fibrillin-1 microfibrils; in addition, the
mutant protein triggered an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response,
as indicated by strong colocalization of the mutant with folding
chaperones in the ER and by increased rates of apoptosis in patient
fibroblasts. Histologic analysis of patient skin sections showed a lack
of fibulin-5 in the extracellular matrix and concomitant disorganization
of dermal elastic fibers, and electron microscopy of patient elastic
fibers showed a failure of elastin globules to fuse into a continuous
elastic fiber core.

.0002
CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 2
FBLN5, 483-BP DUP

Markova et al. (2003) analyzed the expression of the elastin gene and
the fibulin genes 1 through 5 in fibroblasts from 5 patients with cutis
laxa (ADCL2; 614434). One patient was found to express both normal (2.2
kb) and mutant (2.7 kb) fibulin-5 mRNA transcripts. The larger
transcript contained an internal duplication of 483 nucleotides, which
resulted in the synthesis and secretion of a mutant fibulin-5 protein
with 4 additional tandem calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like
motifs. The mutation arose from a 22-kb tandem gene duplication,
encompassing the sequence from intron 4 to exon 9. No fibulin-5 or
elastin mutations were detected in the other 4 patients.

CUTIS LAXA, AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE, TYPE IA
FBLN5, CYS217ARG

In 3 affected sibs from a consanguineous Lebanese family with severe
generalized cutis laxa (ARCL1A; 219100), Callewaert et al. (2013)
identified homozygosity for a 649T-C transition in the FBLN5 gene,
resulting in a cys217-to-arg (C217R) substitution at a highly conserved
residue in the fourth calcium-binding EGF-like domain. The female
proband died of pulmonary emphysema and bronchiolitis at 11 months of
age; her 2 affected brothers had milder pulmonary emphysema. Other
features in the 3 sibs included peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis,
aortic valve stenosis and/or insufficiency, pyloric stenosis, and
inguinal hernias. Callewaert et al. (2013) noted that the C217R had
previously been identified by Claus et al. (2008) in another Lebanese
family with cutis laxa.

Callewaert et al. (2013) identified homozygosity for a 1171G-T
transversion in the FBLN5 gene, resulting in a glu391-to-ter (E391X)
substitution in the FBLN-specific domain. The mutation was present in
heterozygosity in the unaffected parents and an unaffected sister. The
mother had had 2 spontaneous abortions and 2 older sisters and a brother
with cutis laxa had died in infancy. The proband had a high and broad
forehead, low and broad nasal bridge, beaked nose, large dysplastic

severe emphysema, normal cardiac status by echocardiography,
photophobia, hypotonicity, and normal mental status.

610365	TITLE *610365 C1q- AND TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-RELATED PROTEIN 1; C1QTNF1
;;G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN; GIP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the second intracellular loop of V2R (AVPR2; 300538) as bait in a
yeast 2-hybrid screen of a human kidney cDNA library, followed by RACE
of heart and HEK293 mRNA, Innamorati et al. (2002) cloned C1QTNF1, which
they called GIP. The deduced protein contains 379 amino acids. The
extracellular N terminus contains a TNF (see 191160) family
cysteine-rich region, followed by a transmembrane domain, a C-terminal
collagen-like sequence of 14 Gly-X-Y repeats, and a globular domain.
Northern blot analysis detected prominent expression in heart and lower
expression in placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, prostate and
ovary. Little to no expression was detected in other tissues examined.
In transfected HEK293 and COS cells, epitope-tagged GIP was expressed in
vesicular structures surrounding the nucleus and near the cell surface.
Western blot analysis detected epitope-tagged GIP at about 40 kD and 130
kD, suggesting GIP can form trimers.

GENE FUNCTION

Using a yeast 2-hybrid assay and pull-down experiments, Innamorati et
al. (2002) confirmed the interaction between the second intracellular
loop of V2R and the C-terminal portion of GIP.

GENE STRUCTURE

Innamorati et al. (2002) determined that the C1QTNF1 gene contains 3
coding exons.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Innamorati et al. (2002) mapped the
C1QTNF1 gene to chromosome 17q25.

609091	TITLE *609091 F-BOX ONLY PROTEIN 9; FBXO9
;;FBX9;;
NY-REN-57
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Members of the F-box protein family, such as FBXO9, are characterized by
an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif. SCF complexes, formed by
SKP1 (601434), cullin (see CUL1; 603134), and F-box proteins, act as
protein-ubiquitin ligases. F-box proteins interact with SKP1 through the
F box, and they interact with ubiquitination targets through other
protein interaction domains (Jin et al., 2004).

CLONING

Using SKP1 as bait in a yeast 2-hybrid screen and by searching DNA
databases, Cenciarelli et al. (1999) identified several genes encoding
F-box proteins, including FBX9. The N-terminal half of FBX9 contains a
leucine zipper, followed by an F box.

Jin et al. (2004) reported that the FBXO9 protein contains an N-terminal
tetratricopeptide repeat, a central F box, and a C-terminal HNH nuclease
family domain.

MAPPING

Jin et al. (2004) stated that the FBXO9 gene maps to chromosome
6p12.3-p11.2 and the mouse Fbxo9 gene maps to chromosome 9E1.0.

614088	TITLE *614088 INTRACELLULAR ADHESION MOLECULE 4; ICAM4
;;CD242 ANTIGEN; CD242;;
LW GENE; LW
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Intracellular adhesion molecule-4 (ICAM4) is a member of the
immunoglobulin (Ig) gene superfamily and encodes the Landsteiner-Wiener
(LW) blood group antigens (111250) (Bailly et al., 1994; Bailly et al.,
1995).

CLONING

Bailly et al. (1994) cloned ICAM4 cDNAs from a human bone marrow cDNA
library. One form encodes a single-spanning transmembrane protein of 270
amino acids, including a 29-amino acid signal peptide. A second form
encodes a shortened protein of 236 residues without transmembrane and
cytoplasm domains. The predicted protein shares approximately 30%
identity with intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM1 (147840), ICAM2
(146630), and ICAM3 (146631), which are the counterreceptors for the
lymphocyte function-associated antigen LFA1 (see 153370 and 600065). The
extracellular domain of ICAM4 consists, like that of ICAM2, of 2 Ig-like
domains, and the critical residues involved in binding of LFA1 to ICAMs
are partially conserved in ICAM4.

Using RT-PCR, Hermand et al. (1995) cloned ICAM4 from whole blood RNA.
The sequence was identical to that of the full-length cDNA reported by
Bailly et al. (1994) except for differences in the region encoding the
signal sequence. The corrected ICAM4 sequence reported by Hermand et al.
(1995) encodes a 271-amino acid protein with a 30-amino acid signal
peptide.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hermand et al. (1996) characterized the ICAM4 gene, which contains 3
exons spanning approximately 2.65 kb.

MAPPING

ICAM4 maps to chromosome 19p13.2, based on the previous mapping of the
LW locus to this location (Hermand et al., 1995).

GENE FUNCTION

Bailly et al. (1995) purified the ICAM4 (LW) protein from red cells and
found that the protein bound to the leukocyte CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18
integrins (see 600065). They speculated that ICAM4 may be involved in
regulation of red cell turnover.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- LW Blood Group System: LW(a)/LW(b) Polymorphism

Hermand et al. (1995) determined that the LW(a)/LW(b) polymorphism of
the LW blood group system (111250) is determined by a single-basepair
substitution in the ICAM4 gene (614088.0001).

- LW Blood Group System: LW(a-b-) Phenotype

Using Southern blot analysis, Hermand et al. (1995) showed that the
ICAM4 gene was not grossly rearranged in an individual with the LW(a-b-)
phenotype of the LW blood group system (111250) or in individuals with
the Rh-null phenotype, who also lack LW antigens. RFLP analysis using
PvuII indicated that the LW(a-b-) individual and 3 Rh-null individuals
were homozygous for a phenotypically silent LW(a) allele.

In an individual with the LW(a-b-) phenotype who carried a normal Rh
phenotype, Hermand et al. (1996) found a 10-bp deletion in the ICAM4
gene (614088.0002) that generated a premature stop codon and encoded a
truncated protein without the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.
Heterogeneity was indicated by the fact that no detectable abnormality
of the LW gene or transcript could be detected in another LW(a-b-)
individual.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
LW BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, LW(a)/LW(b) POLYMORPHISM
ICAM4, GLN100ARG

Hermand et al. (1995) demonstrated that the molecular basis for the
LW(a)/LW(b) polymorphism of the LW blood group system (111250) is an
A-to-G change at nucleotide 299 (relative to the translation initiation
site) of the ICAM4 gene that correlates with a PvuII restriction site
and results in a gln100-to-arg (Q100R) amino acid substitution. COS-7
cells transfected with LW(a) or LW(b) cDNAs reacted with human
anti-LW(a) and anti-LW(b) sera, respectively, as well as with a murine
monoclonal anti-LW(ab) antibody, as shown by flow cytometry analysis.
Hermand et al. (1995) referred to this polymorphism as an A-to-G change
at nucleotide 308 (relative to the transcription initiation site),
resulting in a GLN70ARG (Q70R) substitution (numbering using the mature
ICAM4 protein sequence, after removal of the signal peptide).

.0002
LW BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM, LW(a-b-) PHENOTYPE
ICAM4, 10-BP DEL, NT346

In an individual with the rare LW(a-b-) phenotype of the LW blood group
system (111250) who carried a normal Rh phenotype, Hermand et al. (1996)
identified a 10-bp deletion (ACCTGCGCAG) at nucleotide 346 (relative to
the translation initiation site) in exon 1 of the ICAM4 gene. The
deletion generated a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated
protein without the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Heterogeneity
was indicated by the fact that no detectable abnormality of the ICAM4
gene or transcript could be detected in another LW(a-b-) individual.
Hermand et al. (1996) referred to this mutation as a 10-bp deletion at
nucleotide 355 (relative to the transcription initiation site).

176871	TITLE *176871 EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION INITIATION FACTOR 2-ALPHA KINASE 2; EIF2AK2
;;PROTEIN KINASE, INTERFERON-INDUCIBLE DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA-ACTIVATED;
PRKR;;
PKR;;
p68 KINASE
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

EIF2AK2 is a protein serine/threonine kinase that acquires enzymatic
activity following autophosphorylation, a process mediated by
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Activation of EIF2AK2 allows the kinase to
phosphorylate its natural substrate, the alpha subunit of eukaryotic
protein synthesis initiation factor-2 (EIF2-alpha; 603907), leading to
the inhibition of protein synthesis (summary by Kuhen et al., 1996).

CLONING

Meurs et al. (1990) cloned EIF2AK2, which encodes a 550-amino acid
protein with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kD. Immunoblot assay of
interferon-treated human Daudi and murine L929 cells identified a 68-kD
protein in human cells and a 65-kD protein in mouse cells. Transcription
of EIF2AK2 was induced following exposure to interferon (IFNG; 147570)
in a dose-dependent manner and was not affected by inhibition of protein
synthesis.

Kuhen et al. (1996) isolated the EIF2AK2 gene, which they called PKR, as
lambda phage and P1 phage clones from a human genomic library, and
compared the structural organization of the mouse and human genes. The
human and mouse proteins shared approximately 60% amino acid identity.
Kuhen et al. (1996) determined the nucleotide sequence of the human
EIF2AK2 gene, which encodes a 551-amino acid protein.

Jeon et al. (2012) reported that PKR contains 2 N-terminal dsRNA-
binding motifs and a long C-terminal kinase domain.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kuhen et al. (1996) determined that the EIF2AK2 gene contains 17 exons
and spans approximately 50 kb.

MAPPING

Barber et al. (1993) mapped the EIF2AK2 gene to chromosome 2p21 by in
situ hybridization. The corresponding mouse gene was mapped to
chromosome 17 (band E2) by the same method. By FISH analysis, Squire et
al. (1993) assigned the EIF2AK2 gene to the boundary between chromosome
2p22-p21.

GENE FUNCTION

Ben-Asouli et al. (2002) showed that human gamma-interferon mRNA uses
local activation of PKR in the cell to control its own translation
yield. IFNG mRNA was found to activate PKR through a pseudoknot in its
5-prime untranslated region. Mutations that impaired pseudoknot
stability reduced the ability to activate PKR and strongly increased the
translation efficiency of IFNG mRNA. Nonphosphorylatable mutant
eIF2-alpha (eIF2A; 609234), knockout of PKR, and the PKR inhibitors
2-aminopurine, transdominant-negative PKR, or vaccinia E3L
correspondingly enhanced translation of IFNG mRNA. The potential to form
the pseudoknot was found to be phylogenetically conserved. Ben-Asouli et
al. (2002) proposed that the RNA pseudoknot acts to adjust translation
of IFNG mRNA to the PKR level expressed in the cell.

Taylor et al. (1999) studied the mechanism underlying the resistance of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) to interferon. They demonstrated that the HCV
envelope protein E2 contains a sequence identical with phosphorylation
sites of the interferon-inducible protein kinase PKR and the translation
initiation factor EIF2-alpha, a target of PKR. E2 inhibited the kinase
activity of PKR and blocked its inhibitory effect on protein synthesis
and cell growth. This interaction of E2 in PKR may be one mechanism by
which HCV circumvents the antiviral effect of interferon. Taylor et al.
(1999) hypothesized that another potential outcome of PKR inhibition is
the promotion of cell growth which may contribute to HCV-associated
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Huntington disease (143100) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a
trinucleotide repeat expansion within the huntingtin gene (613004),
resulting in generation of a polyglutamine tract in the protein product.
Peel et al. (2001) showed that PKR preferentially bound mutant
huntingtin RNA transcripts immobilized on streptavidin columns that had
been incubated with human brain extracts. Immunohistochemical studies
demonstrated that PKR was present in its activated form in both human
Huntington autopsy material and brain tissue derived from Huntington
yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice. The increased
immunolocalization of the activated kinase was more pronounced in areas
most affected by the disease. The authors suggested a role for PKR
activation in the Huntington disease process.

Gale et al. (1998) showed that P58(IPK) (601184) is inhibited through a
direct interaction with P52(rIPK) (607374), which in turn results in
upregulation of PKR activity. Gale et al. (1998) concluded that their
data described a protein kinase-regulatory system that encompasses an
intersection of interferon-, stress-, and growth-regulatory pathways.

PKR, which is involved in TLR signaling and mediates apoptosis in
fibroblasts in response to viral infection and inflammatory cytokines,
also activates IKK (see 600664) and NFKB (see 164011), thereby
suppressing apoptosis. To determine the role of PKR in macrophage
apoptosis, Hsu et al. (2004) examined its regulation and found that both
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and poly(IC) activate PKR dependent on the
presence of TRIF (607601). Macrophages lacking PKR had normal activation
of p38 (MAPK14; 600289) and IKK as well as other NFKB target genes in
response to LPS, but exhibited defective STAT1 (600555) phosphorylation
and failed to undergo apoptosis, independent of the presence of IFNB
(147640). They observed that apoptosis induced by live pathogenic
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria required both TLR4 (603030) and
PKR, possibly representing a major mechanism for pathogenic bacteria
that use specific virulence factors to avoid detection and destruction
by the innate immune system. Hsu et al. (2004) proposed that TLR4
activates PKR and triggers apoptosis through TRIF and TRAM (608321)
adaptor proteins and that inhibition of PKR may augment
macrophage-mediated antibacterial responses.

Zhang et al. (2004) used immunoprecipitation and reconstituted kinase
assays to show that the FANCC (227645), FANCA (607139), and FANCG
(602956) proteins functionally interacted with and inhibited PKR in bone
marrow cells. PKR showed strongest binding to the FANCC protein. PKR
activity was increased in bone marrow cells of patients with Fanconi
anemia (FA; 227650) with mutations in the FANCC, FANCA, or FANCG genes.
All 3 of these cell lines showed significant increases in PKR bound to
the FANCC protein, which correlated with increased PKR activation. The
cells also showed hypersensitivity to growth repression mediated by
IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha (191160). Forced expression of a patient-derived
FANCC mutation increased PKR activation and cell death. Zhang et al.
(2004) concluded that FA mutations cause increased binding of PKR to
FANCC and increased PKR activation, leading to growth inhibition of
hematopoietic progenitors and bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia.

Nallagatla et al. (2007) reported that RNAs with very limited secondary
structures activate PKR in a 5-prime-triphosphate-dependent fashion in
vitro and in vivo. Activation of PKR by 5-prime-triphosphate RNA is
independent of RIG1 (ROBO3; 608630) and is enhanced by treatment with
type I interferon (IFNA; 147660). Surveillance of molecular features at
the 5-prime end of transcripts by PKR presents a means of allowing
pathogenic RNA to be distinguished from self-RNA. Nallagatla et al.
(2007) concluded that this form of RNA-based discrimination may be a
critical step in mounting an early immune response.

To be effective, PKR must recognize a conserved substrate (eIF2A;
609234) while avoiding rapidly evolving substrate mimics such as the
poxvirus-encoded K3L. Using the PKR-K3L system and a combination of
phylogenetic and functional analyses, Elde et al. (2009) uncovered
evolutionary strategies by which host proteins can overcome viral
mimicry. Elde et al. (2009) found that PKR has evolved under intense
episodes of positive selection in primates. The ability of PKR to evade
viral mimics is partly due to positive selection at sites most
intimately involved in eIF2A recognition. They also found that adaptive
changes on multiple surfaces of PKR produce combinations of
substitutions that increase the odds of defeating mimicry. Elde et al.
(2009) concluded that, although it can seem that pathogens gain
insurmountable advantages by mimicking cellular components, host factors
such as PKR can compete in molecular 'arms races' with mimics because of
evolutionary flexibility at protein interaction interfaces challenged by
mimicry.

Using HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts,
Yoon et al. (2009) found PKR mRNA and protein were upregulated by p53
(TP53; 191170) and by genotoxic stress, which induces p53 expression.
Deletion analysis and DNase footprinting revealed 2 half-sites for p53
binding within the PKR promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays,
chromatin immunoprecipitation, and reporter gene assays revealed direct
p53 binding to these sites, with activation of the PKR promoter. Binding
and activation of PKR by p53 was independent of interferon binding. In
response to genotoxic stress, cytoplasmic PKR was largely phosphorylated
and was associated with the phosphorylation and activation of
EIF2-alpha. Knockdown of either p53 or PKR abrogated all cellular
effects of genotoxic stress. PKR also played a role in p53-mediated
inhibition of translation, G2 arrest, and apoptosis following DNA
damage. Furthermore, knockdown of PKR in HCT116 cells and derived tumors
provided resistance to anticancer agents. Yoon et al. (2009) concluded
that PKR has a role in p53-mediated cellular responses to genotoxic
stress.

By studying HMGB1 (163905) release mechanisms, Lu et al. (2012)
identified a role for PKR in inflammasome activation. Exposure of
macrophages to inflammasome agonists induced PKR autophosphorylation.
PKR inactivation by genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition
severely impaired inflammasome activation in response to double-stranded
RNA, ATP, monosodium urate, adjuvant aluminum, rotenone, live E. coli,
anthrax lethal toxin, DNA transfection, and S. typhimurium infection.
PKR deficiency significantly inhibited the secretion of IL1-beta
(147720), IL18 (600953), and HMGB1 in E. coli-induced peritonitis. PKR
physically interacts with several inflammasome components, including
NLRP3 (606416), NLRP1 (606636), NLRC4 (606831), and AIM2 (604578), and
broadly regulates inflammasome activation. PKR autophosphorylation in a
cell-free system with recombinant NLRP3, ASC (PYCARD; 606838), and
pro-caspase-1 (147678) reconstituted inflammasome activity. Lu et al.
(2012) concluded that their results showed a crucial role for PKR in
inflammasome activation, and indicated that it should be possible to
pharmacologically target this molecule to treat inflammation.

Lee et al. (2011) found that the long noncoding RNA VTRNA2-1 (614938),
which they called pre-MIR886, directly bound to PKR in human cell lines
and inhibited its autoactivation. VTRNA2-1 was downregulated and PKR was
activated in a significant number of diverse cancer cell lines.
Knockdown of VTRNA2-1 resulted in PKR activation and PKR-dependent
phosphorylation of EIF2-alpha. PKR activation also independently induced
the NF-kappa-B pathway.

Kunkeaw et al. (2012) confirmed that VTRNA2-1, which they called NC886,
was a direct inhibitor of PKR. Knockdown of NC886 in nontransformed
cholangiocyte cells consistently activated the canonical PKR-EIF2-alpha
cell death pathway. However, in cholangiocarcinoma cells that either
lacked endogenous NC886 expression or in which NC886 expression was
knocked down, PKR activation frequently induced the NF-kappa-B cell
survival pathway. Kunkeaw et al. (2012) concluded that the effects of
NC886 downregulation or PKR activation depend on cellular context.

Jeon et al. (2012) found that a central region of NC886 stably
interacted with the 2 N-terminal dsRNA-binding motifs of PKR, with much
weaker binding to each motif individually. PKR bound preferentially to
NC886 in its slow-migrating conformation when the PKR-binding sequence
was single-stranded and sensitive to RNase digestion, but not when it
assumed a 4-nucleotide duplex structure. NC886 reciprocally competed
with double-stranded poly(I:C) for PKR binding. Because NC886 does not
show an extensive duplex region, Jeon et al. (2012) predicted that NC886
and dsRNAs bind PKR via different mechanisms. They hypothesized that
NC886 provides a threshold for PKR activation so that it occurs during
genuine viral infection and not in response to basal levels of cellular
dsRNA.

600339	TITLE *600339 HEPATOMA-DERIVED GROWTH FACTOR; HDGF
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nakamura et al. (1994) purified a novel hepatoma-derived growth factor
from the conditioned medium of human hepatoma-derived cell line HuH-7.
Molecular cloning of a cDNA from the cDNA library of the same cell line
was done on the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The cDNA
was 2.4 kb long and the deduced amino acid sequence contained 240 amino
acids without a signal peptide-like N-terminal hydrophobic sequence. The
primary sequence shared homology with the high mobility group-1 protein
(163905); they showed 23.4% amino acid identity and 35.6% amino acid
similarity.

GENE FUNCTION

By immunofluorescence study, Nakamura et al. (1994) showed that HDGF is
localized in the cytoplasm of hepatoma cells and northern blots showed
that it is expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues and tumor cell
lines. Nakamura et al. (1994) suggested that it is a novel
heparin-binding protein with mitogenic activity for fibroblasts.

MAPPING

By PCR screening of a commercial monochromosomal hybrid panel, Wanschura
et al. (1996) mapped HDGF to the X chromosome. By FISH, they refined the
localization to Xq25. Subsequently, however, the International Radiation
Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the HDGF gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP
SHGC-132090). Amberger (2007) refined the localization to 1q21 based on
an alignment of the HDGF sequence (GenBank GENBANK D16431) with the
genomic sequence (build 36.2).

609504	TITLE *609504 MICROSPHERULE PROTEIN 1; MCRS1
;;p78
MICROSPHERULE PROTEIN, 58-KD, INCLUDED; MSP58, INCLUDED;;
MICROSPHERULE PROTEIN 2, INCLUDED; MCRS2, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Using the herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 protein ICP22 as bait in a yeast
2-hybrid screen of a HeLa cell cDNA library, followed by screening a
HeLa cell cDNA library, Bruni and Roizman (1998) cloned MCRS1, which
they designated p78. The deduced 534-amino acid protein contains
potential nuclear localization signals in its N-terminal half and a
leucine zipper region in its C-terminal half. Western blot analysis
detected a major p78 doublet at about 78 kD and minor bands at about 62
and 55 kD. In vitro transcription-translation of p78 cDNA resulted in a
55-kD protein, suggesting that the bands at 78 kD represent highly
modified proteins. Western blot analysis of synchronized HeLa cells
detected p78 expression only in early S phase. It was not expressed in
nondividing HeLa cells or human foreskin fibroblasts. Immunolocalization
of p78 in HeLa cells detected the protein predominantly in nuclei.
However, in Hep-2 liver carcinoma cells, p78 localized to both nuclei
and cytoplasm, and in HSV-infected Hep-2 cells, it localized in a few
dense nuclear bodies or at the nuclear membrane.

By yeast 2-hybrid screening using NOL1 (164031) as bait, followed by PCR
of a HeLa cell cDNA library, Ren et al. (1998) cloned MSP58. The deduced
462-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 51.8 kD and
shares 96.8% amino acid identity with mouse Msp58. The N-terminal half
of MSP58 contains a serine-rich region, a nucleolar localization signal,
and a monopartite nuclear localization signal, and the C-terminal half
contains a coiled-coil region. Northern blot analysis detected a major
1.9-kb MSP58 transcript in all 8 tissues examined, with highest
expression in testis and lowest expression in colon. Western blot
analysis detected a 58-kD MSP58 protein in fractionated HeLa cell
nucleoli. Double-immunolabeling experiments found MSP58 within nucleolar
microspherules, where it colocalized with fibrillarin (FBL; 134795).

Using the telomerase-inhibitory protein LPTS (PINX1; 606505) as bait in
a yeast 2-hybrid screen of a brain cDNA library, Song et al. (2004)
cloned an MCRS1 variant that they designated MCRS2. The deduced MCRS2
protein contains 475 amino acids. Song et al. (2004) determined that the
MCRS1/p78, MSP58, and MCRS2 proteins differ only in their N termini and
are likely the products of variable spliced transcripts. All 3 isoforms
have a C-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which mediates
protein-protein interactions and is associated with transcriptional
regulation, DNA repair, and cell-cycle progression. PCR analysis
detected MCRS1 and MCRS2 expression in brain and liver cDNA libraries. A
human hepatoma cell line expressed MCRS2 protein only in early S phase.

GENE FUNCTION

Bruni and Roizman (1998) found that p78 interacted specifically with the
HSV-1 protein ICP22 in nuclear extracts prepared from HSV-infected HeLa
cells.

Using truncation mutants in a yeast 2-hybrid assay, Ren et al. (1998)
determined that the C-terminal half of MCRS1 contains the NOL1-binding
site. Overexpression of MSP58 in COS-7 cells caused a 15-fold increase
in nucleolar volume. Inhibition of pre-rRNA transcription by actinomycin
D caused a relocalization of MSP58 from nucleolar microspherules to
'caps' containing the fibrillar centers. ELISA of sucrose density
fractions of HeLa cell nuclear extracts demonstrated comigration of
MSP58, fibrillarin, and NOL1 in nucleolar particulates.

Lin and Shih (2002) found that MSP58 interacted with DAXX (603186), an
adaptor protein associated with FAS (TNFRSF6; 134637) signaling and
caspase-independent cell death. DAXX interacted with MSP58 in vitro and
in vivo, and MSP58 overexpression correlated with sequestration of DAXX
from a diffuse nuclear distribution to the nucleolus. MSP58
overexpression relieved DAXX-mediated transcriptional repression. Lin
and Shih (2002) concluded that translocation of the MSP58-DAXX complex
to the nucleolus results in derepression of DAXX-regulated genes.

By in vitro pull-down assays, Song et al. (2004) confirmed an
interaction between MCRS2 and LPTS. The 2 proteins colocalized in
transfected cells, particularly in nucleoli and more weakly at telomere
speckles. The N-terminal 216 amino acids of MCRS2 were sufficient to
direct telomere localization. Overexpression of this MCRS2 N-terminal
region in a hepatoma cell line caused progressive shortening of
telomeres during passage, whereas control cells maintained telomere
length. Song et al. (2004) found that MCRS2 also associated with TERT
(187270) and inhibited telomerase activity in vitro in a
concentration-dependent manner.

By immunoprecipitation analysis, Shimono et al. (2005) found that MCRS1
interacted with MI2-beta (CHD4; 603277), RFP (TRIM27; 602165), and UBF
(UBTF; 600673). Yeast 2-hybrid screening showed that the central region
of MCRS1 interacted with the ATPase/helicase region of MI2-beta and the
coiled-coil region of RFP. Confocal microscopy demonstrated
colocalization of MCRS1, MI2-beta, RFP, and UBF in nucleoli. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays showed that MCRS1, MI2-beta, and RFP
associated with rDNA and were involved in transactivation of ribosomal
gene transcription, which could be downregulated by small interfering
RNA-mediated downregulation of MCRS1, MI2-beta, and RFP. Shimono et al.
(2005) concluded that MI2-beta and RFP, which are involved in
transcriptional repression in the nucleus, associate with MCRS1 in the
nucleolus and are involved in activation of rRNA transcription.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MCRS1
gene to chromosome 12 (TMAP RH77809).

613321	TITLE *613321 GLUCOSIDE XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE 1; GXYLT1
;;GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 8 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 3; GLT8D3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GXYLT1 is a xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.-) that adds the first xylose
to O-glucose-modified residues in the epidermal growth factor (EGF;
131530) repeats of proteins such as NOTCH1 (190198) (Sethi et al.,
2010).

CLONING

By searching a database for sequences similar to the catalytic domain of
UGGT1 (605897), Sethi et al. (2010) identified human GXYLT1 and GXYLT2
(613322). The deduced 409-amino acid GXYLT1 protein contains a short
N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, followed by a transmembrane domain, a
stem region, and a large glycosyltransferase domain containing the
conserved DxD motif. GXYLT1 and GXYLT2 share about 50% amino acid
identity.

GENE FUNCTION

Using in vitro assays, Sethi et al. (2010) showed that engineered
soluble forms of GXYLT1 and GXYLT2 specifically used UDP-xylose as
substrate and transferred xylose to a synthetic acceptor containing an
O-glucose modification. HPLC analysis showed that the bond formed by
GXYLT1 involved an alpha-1,3 linkage. GXYLT1 and GXYLT2 functioned as
xylosyltransferases for the glucosylated peptide substrates EGF repeat 1
of factor VII (F7; 613878) and EGF repeats 1 through 5 of mouse Notch1.
Sethi et al. (2010) concluded that GXYLT1 and GXYLT2 are
UDP-D-xylose:beta-D-glucoside alpha-1,3-D-xylosyltransferases.

MAPPING

Hartz (2010) mapped the GXYLT1 gene to chromosome 12q12 based on an
alignment of the GXYLT1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK BC015597) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

125855	TITLE *125855 DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE, ALPHA, 80-KD; DGKA
;;DIACYLGLYCEROL KINASE, ALPHA; DAGK1;;
DAGK, 80-KD;;
DGK-ALPHA
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Diacylglycerol (DAG) kinases (DGKs or DAGKs; EC 2.7.1.107), such as
DGKA, phosphorylate DAG to phosphatidic acid, thus removing DAG.
Phosphatidic acid functions both in signaling and phospholipid
synthesis. In intracellular signaling pathways, DAGK can be viewed as a
modulator that competes with protein kinase C (PKC; see 600448) for the
second messenger DAG (summary by Topham and Prescott, 1999).

CLONING

By sequencing tryptic peptides of DG kinase purified from human white
blood cells, followed by PCR of human Jurkat leukemic T cells and
screening human DND41 leukemic T cells, Schaap et al. (1990) obtained
full-length DAGK cDNA. The deduced 735-amino acid protein has a
calculated molecular mass of 82.7 kD. It has 2 EF-hand motifs predicted
to bind calcium, 2 cysteine-repeat regions, 2 putative ATP-binding
sites, and a C-terminal stretch of 110 amino acids that is fully
conserved between human and pig DAGK. One of the ATP-binding sites is
contained within the first cysteine-rich region. Northern blot analysis
detected a 3.2-kb DAGK transcript in Jurkat cells and in normal human T
cells. Purified human DAGK had an apparent molecular mass of 86 kD by
SDS-PAGE and 87 kD by gel filtration.

GENE FUNCTION

Schaap et al. (1990) found that DAGK purified from human white blood
cells showed optimal activity in the presence of phosphatidylserine and
deoxycholate. It showed relatively broad specificity, and DAG analogs
containing an unsaturated fatty acid at the sn-2 position gave optimal
enzymatic activity in the presence or absence of deoxycholate. Activity
was not altered by calcium or calcium chelation. COS-7 cells
overexpressing human DAGK showed 6- to 7-fold higher DAGK activity than
controls.

Several mammalian isozymes of DAGK have been identified. The isoform
described by Schaap et al. (1990) has been designated DGK-alpha or
DAGK1. Topham and Prescott (1999) stated that all DGKs have a conserved
catalytic domain and at least 2 cysteine-rich regions homologous to the
C1A and C1B motifs of PKCs. Most DGKs have structural motifs that are
likely to play regulatory roles, and these motifs form the basis for
dividing the DGKs into 5 subtypes. Type I DGKs, such as DGK-alpha, -beta
(604070), and -gamma (601854), have calcium-binding EF-hand motifs at
their N termini. DGK-delta (601826) and DKG-eta (604071) contain
N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and are defined as type II.
DGK-epsilon (601440) contains no identifiable regulatory domains and is
a type III DGK. The defining characteristic of type IV isozymes, such as
DGK-zeta (601441) and -iota (604072), is that they have C-terminal
ankyrin repeats. Group V is exemplified by DGK-theta (601207), which
contains 3 cysteine-rich domains and a PH domain.

Pilz et al. (1995) pointed to the growing evidence to support some form
of light-activated phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway in the
mammalian retina. Although this pathway had no obvious role in mammalian
phototransduction, mutations in this pathway were known to cause retinal
degeneration in Drosophila. For example, the 'retinal degeneration A'
mutant in Drosophila is caused by an alteration in the eye-specific DAGK
gene.

To maintain cellular homeostasis, intracellular DAG levels must be
tightly regulated. DAG functions in intracellular signaling pathways as
an allosteric activator of PKC. In addition, DAG appears to play a role
in regulating RAS (see 190020) and RHO (see 165370) family proteins by
activating the guanine nucleotide exchange factors VAV (164875) and
RASGRP1 (603962). DAG also occupies a central position in the synthesis
of major phospholipids and triacylglycerols. Topham and Prescott (1999)
summarized the roles of mammalian DAGKs.

Seven-transmembrane receptor signaling is transduced by second
messengers such as DAG generated in response to the heterotrimeric
guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) (600998) and is terminated by
receptor desensitization and degradation of the second messengers.
Nelson et al. (2007) showed that beta-arrestins (see 107940) coordinate
both processes for the G(q)-coupled M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1;
118510). Beta-arrestins physically interact with diacylglycerol kinases,
enzymes that degrade DAG. Moreover, beta-arrestins are essential for
conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid after agonist stimulation, and
this activity requires recruitment of the beta-arrestin-DGK complex to
activated 7-transmembrane receptors. The dual function of
beta-arrestins, limiting production of diacylglycerol (by receptor
desensitization) while enhancing its rate of degradation, is analogous
to their ability to recruit adenosine 3-prime,5-prime-monophosphate
phosphodiesterases to G(s) (139320)-coupled beta-2-adrenergic receptors
(ADRB2; 109690). Thus, Nelson et al. (2007) concluded that
beta-arrestins can serve similar regulatory functions for disparate
classes of 7-transmembrane receptors through structurally dissimilar
enzymes that degrade chemically distinct second messengers.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Solution Structure

Van Horn et al. (2009) solved the solution structure of prokaryotic Dagk
solubilized in dodecylphosphocholine micelles. The 121-amino acid Dagk
subunits formed homotrimers in solution, and each subunit contributed 3
transmembrane helices to the holoenzyme. The structure suggested domain
swapping between Dagk monomers, where transmembrane helix 3 of each
subunit interacted with transmembrane helices 1 and 2 from an adjacent
subunit, stabilizing the structure.

- Crystal Structure

Li et al. (2013) presented the crystal structure for 3 functional forms
of the 121-amino acid prokaryotic diacylglycerol kinase subunit, one of
which was wildtype. The structure revealed a homotrimeric enzyme with 3
transmembrane helices and an amino-terminal amphiphilic helix per
monomer. Bound lipid substrate and docked ATP identified the putative
active site that is of the composite, shared site type. The crystal
structures rationalized extensive biochemical and biophysical data on
the enzyme. They were, however, at variance with the solution NMR model
of van Horn et al. (2009) in that domain swapping, a key feature of the
solution form, was not observed in the crystal structures.

MAPPING

In an effort to consider genes mutated in Drosophila as candidates for
mammalian eye disease, Pilz et al. (1995) determined the map position of
3 DAGK genes in the mouse. They localized the mouse homolog of DAGK1 to
chromosome 10 by linkage analysis.

By Southern blot analysis of human-hamster somatic cell hybrid DNA, Hart
et al. (1994) assigned the DAGK gene to chromosome 12. Hart et al.
(1994) further localized the gene to 12q13.3 by fluorescence in situ
hybridization.

605995	TITLE *605995 KINESIN FAMILY MEMBER 1B; KIF1B
;;KIAA0591
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Nangaku et al. (1994) cloned a member of the mouse kinesin superfamily,
Kif1b, which encodes an N-terminal-type motor protein. Kif1b was
expressed in all tissues tested. In situ hybridization revealed that
Kif1b was expressed abundantly in differentiated nerve cells.

Zhao et al. (2001) identified an isoform of mouse Kif1b, which they
called Kif1b-beta, that is distinct from Kif1b-alpha (Nangaku et al.,
1994) in its cargo-binding domain.

Yang et al. (2001) identified the KIF1B gene in a homozygously deleted
region of chromosome 1p36.2 in a neuroblastoma cell line. They reported
results suggesting that the gene is not a candidate for tumor suppressor
gene of neuroblastoma. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that human
KIF1B has at least 2 isoforms. The long isoform (KIF1B-beta) was
expressed in a wide variety of tissues, while the short isoform
(KIF1B-alpha) was detected only in adult testis.

GENE STRUCTURE

Schlisio et al. (2008) stated that the KIF1B gene contains 46 coding
exons.

MAPPING

By STS analysis, Gong et al. (1996) mapped the human KIF1B gene to
chromosome 1p36. They mapped the mouse Kif1b gene to chromosome 4.

Zuchner et al. (2004) stated that the KIF1B gene maps to chromosome
1p36.2, about 1.65 Mb telomeric to the MFN2 gene (608507), which is
mutant in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-2A2 (CMT2A2; 609260).

NOMENCLATURE

Lawrence et al. (2004) presented a standardized kinesin nomenclature
based on 14 family designations. Under this system, KIF1B belongs to the
kinesin-3 family.

GENE FUNCTION

Nangaku et al. (1994) found that mouse Kif1b works as a monomer, having
a microtubule plus-end-directed motility. Rotary shadowing electron
microscopy revealed mostly single globular structures.
Immunocytochemically, Kif1b was colocalized with mitochondria in vivo. A
subcellular fractionation study showed that Kif1b was concentrated in
the mitochondrial fraction, and purified Kif1b could transport
mitochondria along microtubules in vitro. These data suggested that
Kif1b works as a monomeric motor for anterograde transport of
mitochondria.

Schlisio et al. (2008) found that apoptosis caused by NGF (see NGFB;
162030) withdrawal from cultured neuronal cells was mediated by EGLN3
(606426) and its downstream effector, KIF1B-beta.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease 2A1

In all affected members of a family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-2A1
(CMT2A1; 118210), Zhao et al. (2001) identified a loss-of-function
mutation in the KIF1B gene (605995.0001).

- Role in Cancer

In 1 medulloblastoma (155255), 3 neuroblastomas (NBLST1; 256700), and 2
pheochromocytoma (171300) tumor samples, Schlisio et al. (2008)
identified 6 different missense mutations in the KIF1B gene. In 3 tumors
there was loss of the wildtype allele and in 3 there was retention,
including 1 in which there was low-level amplification of the mutant
allele. In the 4 cases in which corresponding germline DNA samples from
the respective patients were available, the mutations were also present
(605995.0002-605995.0005). Functional studies in primary rat sympathetic
neurons revealed that induction of apoptosis was impaired with all of
the KIF1B variants compared to wildtype.

- Other Disease Associations

For discussion of an association between variation in the KIF1B gene and
multiple sclerosis, see MS4 (612596).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhao et al. (2001) generated Kif1b knockout mice by gene targeting.
Kif1b knockout mice died at birth from apnea due to nervous system
defects. Death of knockout neurons in culture could be rescued by
expression of the Kif1b-beta isoform. The Kif1b heterozygotes had a
defect in transporting synaptic vesicle precursors and suffered from
progressive muscle weakness similar to human neuropathies.

Lyons et al. (2009) identified a mutation in the zebrafish Kif1b gene
that disrupted localization of Mbp (159430) mRNA in the central nervous
system (CNS) and outgrowth of the posterior lateral line nerve in the
peripheral nervous system (PNS). Using antisense morpholino
oligonucleotides to block translation of individual Kif1b isoforms, they
found that the phenotype was due to loss of Kif1b-beta rather than
Kif1b-alpha, even though the mutation occurred in the common region
shared by both isoforms. Examination of the zebrafish mutants revealed
that Kif1b was required to localize myelin mRNA to oligodendrocyte
processes, to elaborate the correct amount of myelin around axons, and
to prevent ectopic production of myelin-like membrane. Normal Kif1b
function was also required for development of certain axons in the CNS
and PNS.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE, AXONAL, TYPE 2A1
KIF1B, GLN98LEU

In all affected individuals of a Japanese family (family 694) with
autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A1 (CMT2A1; 118210)
reported by Saito et al. (1997), Zhao et al. (2001) identified an A-to-T
transversion in the KIF1B gene, resulting in a gln98-to-leu (Q98L)
substitution. The Q98L mutation was not identified in 95 healthy,
unrelated Japanese controls. The mutation occurred in the middle of the
P loop, the consensus ATP-binding site, and was predicted to disrupt the
function of this mechanochemical enzyme. Zhao et al. (2001) tested the
motor activity of recombinant mouse Kif1b with the Q98L mutation. The
microtubule-activated ATP turnover rates were reduced in the mutant
protein. Furthermore, the Q98L mutant protein remained and aggregated in
the perinuclear region, while the wildtype Kif1b protein accumulated at
the cell periphery. These data suggested that the Q98L mutation resulted
in a functional loss of motor activity.

NEUROBLASTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1
KIF1B, GLU656VAL

In a neuroblastoma (256700) tumor sample and in germline DNA from the
corresponding patient, Schlisio et al. (2008) identified an A-T
transversion in exon 20 of the KIF1B gene, resulting in a glu646-to-val
(E646V) substitution. There was loss of the wildtype allele in the tumor
sample, and MYCN (164840) amplification was present.

.0003
NEUROBLASTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1
KIF1B, THR827ILE

In a neuroblastoma (256700) tumor sample and in germline DNA from the
corresponding patient, Schlisio et al. (2008) identified a C-T
transition in exon 24 of the KIF1B gene, resulting in a thr827-to-ile
(T827I) substitution. The wildtype allele was retained in the tumor
sample; no amplification of MYCN (164840) was present, but low-level
(2-fold) amplification of the mutant allele was detected.

.0004
NEUROBLASTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1
KIF1B, PRO1217SER

In a neuroblastoma (256700) tumor sample and in germline DNA from the
corresponding patient, Schlisio et al. (2008) identified a C-T
transition in exon 33 of the KIF1B gene, resulting in a pro1217-to-ser
(P1217S) substitution. There was loss of the wildtype allele in the
tumor sample, and no MYCN (164840) amplification was present.

.0005
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA
NEUROBLASTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 1, INCLUDED
KIF1B, SER1481ASN

In a pheochromocytoma (171300) tumor sample and in germline DNA from the
corresponding patient, Schlisio et al. (2008) identified a 4442G-A
transition in exon 41 of the KIF1B gene, resulting in a ser1481-to-asn
(S1481N) substitution. The wildtype allele was retained in the tumor
sample. The proband was a 28-year-old female who presented at 17 months
of age with a neuroblastoma (256700) and in adulthood developed a mature
ganglioneuroma and bilateral pheochromocytoma. Her paternal grandfather
harbored the mutant S1481N allele and also developed bilateral
pheochromocytoma. In vitro functional expression studies showed that the
mutant protein was deficient in the ability to induce apoptosis of
sympathetic precursor cells in response to growth factor withdrawal
compared to wildtype KIF1B.

Yeh et al. (2008) reported further analysis of the family reported by
Schlisio et al. (2008). The proband developed a leiomyosarcoma, and her
father, who also carried the S1481N mutation, developed adenocarcinoma
of the lung (211980). Analysis of tumor tissue revealed that all 4
neural crest tumors and the leiomyosarcoma retained both KIF1B alleles
and showed no loss of heterozygosity (LOH), consistent with a
haploinsufficiency mechanism. Yeh et al. (2008) postulated that the
leiomyosarcoma may have evolved secondary to the proband's childhood
treatment for neuroblastoma. In contrast, about 45% of cells from the
lung tumor showed LOH at this locus, suggesting a possible role for gene
dosage in development of this nonneural tumor.

;;MITOGEN-INDUCIBLE GENE 6; MIG6;;
RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED LATE TRANSDUCER; RALT;;
GENE 33, RAT, HOMOLOG OF
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ERRFI1 is a cytoplasmic protein whose expression is upregulated with
cell growth (Wick et al., 1995). It shares significant homology with the
protein product of rat gene-33, which is induced during cell stress and
mediates cell signaling (Makkinje et al., 2000; Fiorentino et al.,
2000).

CLONING

By differential screening of cDNA libraries developed from unstimulated
versus serum-stimulated lung fibroblasts, followed by 5-prime RACE of a
hepatoma cell cDNA library, Wick et al. (1995) cloned ERRFI1, which they
called MIG6. The deduced protein contains 462 amino acids and shares
significant homology with the rat gene-33 protein product.
Epitope-tagged MIG6 showed exclusively cytoplasmic staining following
transfection into mouse fibroblasts.

Makkinje et al. (2000) determined that the protein encoded by rat
gene-33 contains a CRIB domain, an SH3-binding motif, a 14-3-3 (see
113508)-binding domain, an ACK (606994) homology domain, and a
PDZ-binding region. Makkinje et al. (2000) hypothesized that the protein
is an adaptor capable of binding monomeric GTPases of the Rho (see
602924) subfamily.

GENE FUNCTION

Wick et al. (1995) determined that serum induction of the MIG6
transcript was blocked by inhibition of RNA polymerase and was partially
blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis. In contrast to other
mitogen-responsive genes, MIG6 mRNA expression was also regulated during
normal cell cycle progression, showing a clear peak around mid-G1.
Consistent with cell cycle regulation, terminal differentiation of
myeloid leukemia cells to either granulocytic or macrophage-like cells
led to clear changes in MIG6 mRNA levels. The pattern of MIG6 expression
depended upon the lineage induced.

Makkinje et al. (2000) determined that gene-33 mRNA was induced in rat
renal mesangial cells following osmotic stress, exposure to human
endothelin-1 (131240) or angiotensin-2 (106150), or calcium
mobilization. It was also induced in human pulmonary epithelial cells
following mechanical strain. Gene-33 protein interacted in vivo with
CDC42 (116952); in vitro, this interaction was GTP-dependent. Transient
expression of gene-33 in human embryonic kidney cells resulted in
selective activation of stress-activated protein kinases (see MAPK8;
601158).

Fiorentino et al. (2000) showed that the rat gene-33 protein, which they
designated Ralt, interacted with Erbb2 (164870). Direct interaction
required the catalytic activity of Erbb2. Expression of gene-33 was
absent in quiescent mouse fibroblasts but was induced following serum
stimulation. Overexpression of gene-33 in mouse fibroblasts inhibited
several Erbb2-dependent processes, including cell proliferation, cell
transformation, and the sustained activation of Erk1 (601795) and Erk2
(176948). Overexpression did not inhibit cell proliferation or ERK
activation induced by serum, and it did not inhibit cell transformation
induced by Ras (190020) or Src (190090). Fiorentino et al. (2000)
hypothesized that gene-33 is a feedback inhibitor of Erbb2 and
suppresses its mitogenic and oncogenic activity.

By Western blot analysis, Ferby et al. (2006) found undetectable MIG6
levels in 6 of 9 human breast cancer cell lines expressing EGFR
(131550). Of those, 3 cell lines showed the highest levels of EGFR
phosphorylation. In contrast, the 3 cell lines expressing MIG6 had low
to undetectable phosphorylation of EGFR. Depletion of MIG6 by siRNA
resulted in increased phosphorylation of EGFR over time as MIG6 protein
levels decreased. Ferby et al. (2006) concluded that downregulation of
MIG6 leads to activation of ERBB signaling.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Zhang et al. (2007) determined the crystal structure of a complex
between the EGFR kinase domain and a fragment of MIG6 at 2.9-angstrom
resolution, which showed that an approximately 25-residue epitope from
MIG6 binds to the distal surface of the C lobe of the kinase domain.
Biochemical and cell-based analyses confirmed that this interaction
contributes to EGFR inhibition by blocking the formation of the
activating dimer interface. A longer MIG6 peptide that is extended C
terminal to segment 1 has increased potency as an inhibitor of the
activated EGFR kinase domain, while retaining a critical dependence on
segment 1. Zhang et al. (2007) showed that signaling by EGFR molecules
that contain constitutively active kinase domains still requires
formation of the asymmetric dimer, underscoring the importance of dimer
interface blockage in MIG6-mediated inhibition.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the ERRFI1
gene to chromosome 1 (TMAP stSG4733).

ANIMAL MODEL

Zhang et al. (2005) found that Mig6 -/- mice were viable, but they were
born in less than the expected ratio, indicating some embryonic
lethality. Although Mig6 was highly expressed in wildtype mouse liver
and kidney, no obvious pathologic changes were observed in these tissues
in Mig6 -/- mice. Instead, most Mig6 -/- mice showed an abnormal gait at
1 month of age. With time, they showed progressive enlargement and
deformity of multiple joints, including bony outgrowths or osteophyte
formation within joint spaces, especially the knees, ankles, and
temporomandibular joints (TMJs). All Mig6 -/- mice developed joint
deformities, and the majority died within 6 months, most likely due to
TMJ ankylosis, resulting in the inability to eat or drink. The
osteophyte formation appeared to be due to proliferation of mesenchymal
progenitor cells, followed by differentiation into chondrocytes.

Ferby et al. (2006) found that Errfi1 -/- mice were born at the expected
mendelian ratio and, within a few days after birth, they showed a fully
penetrant skin phenotype characterized by thickening, flaking, and
ulceration of tail and footpad skin. The epidermal hyperplasia varied
somewhat in severity, depending on genetic background. Most Errfi1 -/-
mice also had a 5- to 10-day delay in the opening of the eyelids
compared with control littermates. Deletion of the Errfi1 gene caused
hyperactivation of endogenous Egfr and sustained signaling through the
MAPK (see MAPK1; 176948) pathway, resulting in overproliferation and
impaired differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Ferby et al. (2006)
showed that Errfi1 -/- mice developed spontaneous tumors in various
organs and were highly susceptible to chemically induced skin tumors.

AMINO ACID TRANSPORTER A3; ATA3
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SLC38A4 is found predominantly in liver and transports both cationic and
neutral amino acids. The transport of cationic amino acids by SLC38A4 is
Na(+) and pH independent, while the transport of neutral amino acids is
Na(+) and pH dependent (Hatanaka et al., 2001).

CLONING

Using rat Ata3 as probe, Hatanaka et al. (2001) cloned SLC38A4, which
they designated ATA3, from a hepatoma cell line cDNA library. The
deduced 547-amino acid protein contains 10 or 11 transmembrane domains.
ATA3 shares 88% amino acid identity with rat Ata3, and it shares 47 to
57% identity with ATA1 (SLC38A1), ATA2 (SLC38A2; 605180), SN1 (SLC38A3;
604437), and SN2 (SLC38A5; 300649). Northern blot analysis of several
tissues detected a 4.0-kb transcript expressed almost exclusively in
liver; much lower expression was detected in kidney.

By searching databases for sequences similar to mouse Nat (SCN11A;
604385) and human SLC38A3, followed by library screening and nested PCR
of a breast carcinoma cell line cDNA library, Gu et al. (2001) cloned
SLC38A4, which they designated NAT3. The deduced 547-amino acid protein
contains 10 putative transmembrane domains and lacks a signal peptide.
NAT3 and mouse Nat share 55% amino acid identity. Northern blot analysis
of hepatoma and breast carcinoma cell lines detected a 4.0-kb
transcript. RT-PCR detected high expression of NAT3 in adult and
embryonic liver, with lower levels in muscle, kidney, and pancreas, and
trace amounts in placenta and heart. NAT3 transfected into Xenopus
oocytes was expressed at the plasma membrane.

GENE FUNCTION

By functional expression in retinal pigment epithelial cells, Hatanaka
et al. (2001) found that ATA3 mediated high-affinity, Na(+)-independent
transport of cationic amino acids, similar to system y(+)L transporters
(see 604235). Arginine uptake was saturable and occurred at all pH
values within the range 5.5 to 9.0. ATA3 also displayed low-affinity,
Na(+)-coupled transport of all neutral amino acids tested, including
alpha-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB), the model substrate for
system A. Transport of glycine showed pH dependence, with maximal
transport at pH 8.5. Since liver does not express other high-affinity
cationic amino acid transporters, Hatanaka et al. (2001) hypothesized
that ATA3 may provide the major route for arginine uptake in liver.

Gu et al. (2001) found that Xenopus oocytes transfected with NAT3
displayed low-affinity alanine transport. Transport was Na(+) and pH
dependent. Alanine transport increased at higher pH, and like N system
transporters, Li(+) could partially substitute for Na(+). NAT3 also
transported histidine, glutamine, and lysine. By competition assay, Gu
et al. (2001) found that alanine transport was significantly inhibited
by several cationic and neutral amino acids, but not by MeAIB.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hatanaka et al. (2001) and Gu et al. (2001) determined that the SLC3A4
gene contains 16 exons and spans at least 40 kb. Exon 1 is not
translated.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Hatanaka et al. (2001) mapped the SLC38A4
gene to chromosome 12q13. Gu et al. (2001) mapped the SLC38A4 gene to
chromosome 12q12-q13 by electronic PCR and FISH.

CHROMOSOME 11 OPEN READING FRAME 5; C11ORF5;;
FON
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By genome sequence sampling, subcloning, and sequence homology searches,
Lemmens et al. (2000) obtained a cDNA for C11ORF5, also termed FON. The
C11ORF5 cDNA encodes a deduced 403-amino acid acidic (pI 5.8) protein
predicted to have 11 phosphorylation and 6 N-myristoylation sites. The
human and mouse C11ORF5 proteins have 81% sequence identity. Northern
blot analysis revealed low expression of a 1.4-kb transcript in all
tissues tested except for testis in which high expression was seen.
Additional 4- and 7-kb transcripts were seen in skeletal muscle and
heart. In mice, in situ hybridization revealed high expression of
C11orf5 in adult testis, particularly in seminiferous tubules, and lower
expression in all other tissues tested.

GENE STRUCTURE

The C11ORF5 gene contains only 1 exon (Lemmens et al., 2000).

MAPPING

The European Consortium on MEN1 (1997) described 3 gene clusters in the
11q13 region. One 40-kb cluster, termed FAUNA (FAU neighboring area),
contains 7 genes, including FAU (134690), TM7SF2 (603414), and C11ORF5
(Lemmens et al., 1998).

The C11ORF5 gene is positioned in the same transcriptional orientation
as FAU, which is 4 kb upstream. It is located 171 nucleotides upstream
of TM7SF2 in a tail-to-tail configuration (Lemmens et al., 2000).
