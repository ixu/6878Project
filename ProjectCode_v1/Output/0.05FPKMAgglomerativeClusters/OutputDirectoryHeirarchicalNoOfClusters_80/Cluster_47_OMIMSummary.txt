DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

SCRIB is a cytoplasmic multimodular scaffold protein targeted to
epithelial adherens junctions and neuronal presynaptic compartments.
SCRIB and its orthologs in vertebrates and invertebrates participate in
cell polarization (summary by Nola et al., 2008).

CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated myeloid leukemia
cell line cDNA library, Nagase et al. (1995) cloned SCRIB, which they
designated KIAA0147. The nucleotide sequence contains a central GAG
repeat that occurs 19 times within a 36-triplet stretch, creating a
glutamine-rich region in the deduced 1,551-amino acid protein. KIAA0147
shares 32% amino acid identity with yeast adenylyl cyclase over a
302-amino acid region. Northern blot analysis revealed expression in all
tissues examined, with highest expression in skeletal muscle.

Nakagawa and Huibregtse (2000) identified a 220-kD protein within the
lysate of a cervical carcinoma cell line that interacts with human
papillomavirus E6 protein. By mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments,
followed by searching an EST database, they determined that the
E6-interacting protein is KIAA0147, the human homolog of Drosophila
Scrib, with which it shares 35% amino acid identity. SCRIB contains a
series of N-terminal leucine-rich repeats and 4 central PDZ domains.
Comparison with the Drosophila protein suggested that the KIAA0147 cDNA
lacks 5-prime sequences specifying approximately 67 amino acids.

Using a positional cloning approach, Murdoch et al. (2003) identified
Scrb1 as the mouse gene mutated in the 'circletail' (crc) phenotype,
which is characterized by craniorachischisis, a severe neural tube
defect. RT-PCR detected several Scrb1 alternative transcripts resulting
from inclusion or exclusion of exons 16, 29, or 36. During mouse
development, expression of Scrb1 showed a dynamic pattern of expression
in a wide variety of organ systems, as well as in neuroepithelium during
initiation of neural tube closure. Expression of Scrb1 overlapped with
expression of Vangl2 (600533), the gene mutated in 'loop-tail,' a
similar defect of neural tube closure. Coexpression was found in
neuroepithelium, ventricular myocardium, eyelid, lung epithelium,
whisker follicles, and the epithelial lining of the stomach.

GENE FUNCTION

Nakagawa and Huibregtse (2000) determined that SCRIB binds directly to
the human papillomavirus E6 protein. They showed that the binding is
mediated by the PDZ domain of SCRIB and a C-terminal epitope of E6.
Fluorescence-labeled SCRIB localized to the periphery of canine kidney
cells, where it colocalized with ZO1 (TJP1; 601009) in tight junctions.
Nakagawa and Huibregtse (2000) determined that SCRIB is targeted for
ubiquitination by a complex of E6 and UBE3A (601623) in vitro and that
expression of E6 induces degradation of SCRIB and DLG (601014) in vivo.
E6 coexpression resulted in loss of integrity of tight junctions, as
measured by ZO1 localization, and this effect was dependent on the
PDZ-binding epitope of E6.

Montcouquiol et al. (2003) showed that a mutation in the Vangl2 gene
results in significant disruptions in the polarization of stereociliary
bundles in mouse cochlea as a result of defects in the direction of
movement and/or anchoring of the kinocilium within each hair cell.
Similar but less severe defects are observed in animals containing a
mutation in the LAP protein family gene Scrb1. Polarization defects in
animals heterozygous for Vangl2 and Scrb1 are comparable with Vangl2
homozygotes, demonstrating genetic interactions between these genes in
the regulation of planar cell polarity in mammals.

Zhan et al. (2008) showed that depletion of Scribble in mammary
epithelia disrupted cell polarity, blocked 3-dimensional morphogenesis,
inhibited apoptosis, and induced dysplasia in vivo that progressed to
tumors after long latency. Like depletion, mislocalization of Scribble
from cell-cell junctions was sufficient to promote cell transformation.
Spontaneous mammary tumors in mice and humans showed both downregulated
and mislocalized Scribble. Zhan et al. (2008) concluded that Scribble
has a role as a tumor suppressor.

Using immunoprecipitation analysis, Nola et al. (2008) showed that SCRIB
interacted with PAK1 (602590) and PAK2 (605022), serine/threonine
kinases crucial for cell migration. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
that SCRIB and PAK colocalized at the leading edge of migrating human
epithelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts in response to
chemoattractants. Knockdown studies with human breast epithelial cells
showed that SCRIB was required for localization of PAK and beta-PIX
(ARHGEF7; 605477) at the leading edge of migrating cells, PAK
activation, formation of membrane protrusions at the leading edge, and
cell motility. Circletail mouse fibroblasts also showed reduced motility
in response to serum stimulation compared with wildtype fibroblasts. The
cell migration defect of SCRIB-deficient cells appeared to be due to
loss of PAK activation, since constitutively active PAK rescued
chemotaxis in SCRIB-deficient cells. Depletion of beta-PIX or SCRIB
caused comparable defects in cell migration and PAK activation. Nola et
al. (2008) concluded that SCRIB participates in lamellipodia formation
through activation of PAK at the leading edge of migratory cells.

Dow et al. (2008) found that knockdown of SCRIB via small hairpin RNA
cooperated with oncogenic RAS (HRAS; 190020) or RAF (RAF1; 164760)
mutants to promote an invasive phenotype in MCF10A breast epithelia
cells. The invasive phenotype was predominantly due to loss of
SCRIB-dependent suppression of MAP kinase signaling.

GENE STRUCTURE

Murdoch et al. (2003) determined that the mouse Scrb1 gene contains 38
exons and spans about 23 kb.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the SCRIB
gene to chromosome 8 (TMAP RH25368).

ANIMAL MODEL

Circletail (crc) is a mouse phenotype characterized by
craniorachischisis, a severe neural tube defect. Murdoch et al. (2003)
determined that the circletail mutation is a 1-bp insertion in the Scrb1
gene, resulting in a frameshift that leads to premature termination of
the protein.

Phillips et al. (2007) found that crc mouse mutants developed heart
malformation and cardiomyopathy attributable to abnormalities in
cardiomyocyte organization within the early heart tube. N-cadherin
(CDH2; 114020) was lost from the cardiomyocyte cell membrane and
cell-cell adhesion was disrupted. This resulted in abnormalities in
heart looping and in formation of both the trabeculae and compact
myocardium, which ultimately resulted in cardiac misalignment defects
and ventricular noncompaction. Mislocalization of Vangl2 (600533) in
crc/crc cardiomyocytes suggested that wildtype Scrib acts in the planar
cell polarity pathway in the heart. Moreover, heterozygosity for
mutations in both Scrib and Vangl2 caused cardiac defects similar to
those found in homozygous mutants for each gene but without other major
defects.

154950	TITLE *154950 MAX PROTEIN; MAX
;;MYC-ASSOCIATED FACTOR X
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The MAX protein is the most conserved dimerization component of the MYC
(190080)-MAX-MXD1 (600021) network of basic helix-loop-helix leucine
zipper (bHLHZ) transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis. While heterodimerization of MAX with MYC
activates and mediates its transcription and transforming activity,
heterodimerization of MAX with MXD1 family members antagonize
MYC-dependent cell transformation by transcriptional repression of the
same E-box target DNA sequences. The conservation of the MAX sequence is
particularly high in the bHLHZ domain, which is involved in
protein-protein interactions and DNA binding (Nair and Burley, 2003;
Comino-Mendez et al., 2011).

CLONING

Wagner et al. (1992) demonstrated that 2 species of RNA hybridized
specifically to a MAX cDNA probe in all human and murine cell lines
tested. Unlike MYC, the steady state level of MAX RNA was not
significantly modulated with respect to proliferation or
differentiation. Unlike MYC RNA, MAX RNA was relatively stable with a
half-life of more than 3 hours, and therefore it did not exhibit the
characteristic short half-life of RNAs encoded by most immediate early
genes. The predicted tertiary structure of MAX closely resembles that of
MYC, and it was on the basis of the
basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine-zipper (bHLHZ) homology that Prendergast
et al. (1991) cloned the cDNA encoding MAX.

Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) stated that the 160-amino acid MAX protein
contains an N-terminal bHLHZ domain and 6 casein kinase II
phosphorylation sites.

GENE STRUCTURE

The complete structure of the MAX gene was reported by Blackwood and
Eisenman (1991).

Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) noted that the MAX gene contains 5 exons.

MAPPING

By fluorescence in situ chromosomal hybridization, Wagner et al. (1992)
demonstrated that the MAX gene is located on chromosome 14q23. This
region of chromosome 14 is involved in deletions in B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia and malignant lymphomas and in the 12;14
translocation in uterine leiomyomas. Gilladoga et al. (1992) similarly
mapped the MAX gene to chromosome 14q22-q24 by isotopic in situ
hybridization and to mouse chromosome 12 in region D.

GENE FUNCTION

Zervos et al. (1995) described MXI2 (600289), a protein that interacts
with the MAX protein.

Grandori et al. (1996) identified DDX18 (606355) as a direct in vivo
target of Myc and Max and hypothesized that Myc may exert its effects on
cell behavior through proteins that affect RNA structure and metabolism.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Nair and Burley (2003) determined the x-ray structures of the bHLHZ
domains of MYC-MAX and MAD (600021)-MAX heterodimers bound to their
common DNA target, the enhancer box (E box) hexanucleotide
(5-prime-CACGTG-3-prime), at 1.9- and 2.0-angstrom resolution,
respectively. E-box recognition by these 2 structurally similar
transcription factor pairs determines whether a cell will divide and
proliferate (MYC-MAX) or differentiate and become quiescent (MAD-MAX).
Deregulation of MYC has been implicated in the development of many human
cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma, neuroblastomas, and small cell lung
cancers. Both quasisymmetric heterodimers resemble the symmetric MAX
homodimer, albeit with marked structural differences in the coiled-coil
leucine zipper regions that explain preferential homo- and heteromeric
dimerization of these 3 evolutionarily related DNA-binding proteins. The
MYC-MAX heterodimer, but not its MAD-MAX counterpart, dimerizes to form
a bivalent heterotetramer, explaining how MYC can upregulate expression
of genes with promoters bearing widely separated E boxes.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using exome sequencing in 3 unrelated families with bilateral
pheochromocytoma (171300), Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) identified 3
different heterozygous germline mutations in the MAX gene
(154950.0001-154950.0003) that segregated with the disease. A follow-up
study of 59 patients with pheochromocytoma identified 5 additional
mutations (see, e.g., 154950.0004-154950.0005). Studies of tumor tissue
showed a lack of full-length MAX protein and loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) of the MAX allele, which resulted from paternal uniparental disomy
(UPD) and loss of the maternal allele. This LOH constituted the somatic
second-hit of the Knudson hypothesis. The paternal origin of the mutated
allele detected in 6 families suggested preferential paternal
transmission of the disease (p = 0.031). In addition, 2 children who
inherited the mutation from their mother and 2 obligate carriers from
another family did not develop tumors, further supporting this theory.
Eight of 12 cases had bilateral tumors, and 3 of 8 probands had
metastases at diagnosis. Overall, the findings indicated that MAX acts
as a classic tumor suppressor gene. Normal lymphocytes from patients
showed absence of methylation of the MAX promoter and biallelic
expression of MAX, which ruled out an imprinting-mediated effect on MAX
expression. Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) pointed to the study of Hopewell
and Ziff (1995), who showed loss of Max repression ability in rat
pheochromocytoma cells, suggesting that MAX mutations can lead to
deregulation of oncogenic MYC.

NOMENCLATURE

The designation MAX came from MYC associated factor X (Eisenman, 1994).
The murine homolog of MAX is referred to as Myn (Prendergast et al.,
1991).

ANIMAL MODEL

Hopewell and Ziff (1995) showed that a functional Max protein is not
expressed in the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 due to a
mutant form of Max lacking the C terminus. The mutant protein was
incapable of repressing transcription from an E-box element.
Reintroduction of Max into PC12 cells resulted in repression of
E-box-dependent transcription and a reduction in growth rate. The
ability of these cells to divide, differentiate, and apoptose in the
absence of Max demonstrated for the first time that these processes can
occur via Max- and possibly Myc-independent mechanisms.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MAX, MET1VAL

In a 46-year-old woman with bilateral malignant pheochromocytoma
(171300), Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1A-G
transition in exon 1 of the MAX gene, resulting in a met1-to-val (M1V)
substitution in the initiation codon. Heterozygosity for the mutation
was also found in her 29-year-old brother, who had a unilateral
nonmalignant pheochromocytoma, as well as in 2 of her unaffected
children. The mutation was not found in 750 control chromosomes. Studies
of tumor tissue showed a lack of full-length MAX protein and loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) of the MAX allele, which resulted from paternal UPD
and loss of the maternal allele. The findings indicated that MAX acts as
a classic tumor suppressor gene.

.0002
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MAX, ARG75TER

In 4 affected members of a large family with autosomal dominant
inheritance of bilateral nonmalignant pheochromocytoma (171300) with
onset between 28 and 35 years of age, Comino-Mendez et al. (2011)
identified a heterozygous 223C-T transition in exon 4 of the MAX gene,
resulting in an arg75-to-ter (R75X) substitution. One unaffected family
member also carried the mutation, which was not found in 750 control
chromosomes. Studies of tumor tissue showed a lack of full-length MAX
protein and LOH of the MAX allele, which resulted from paternal UPD and
loss of the maternal allele.

.0003
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MAX, IVS4DS, G-A, +1

In a 32-year-old man with bilateral malignant pheochromocytoma (171300),
Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous G-to-A transition
in intron 4 of the MAX gene (295+1G-A), resulting in a splice site
mutation and skipping of exon 4. Family history revealed a deceased
brother and niece with unilateral pheochromocytoma. The mutation was not
found in 750 control chromosomes. Studies of the tumor tissue showed a
lack of full-length MAX protein and LOH of the MAX allele, which
resulted from paternal UPD and loss of the maternal allele.

.0004
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MAX, ARG33TER

In a young man with bilateral nonmalignant pheochromocytoma (171300),
Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 97C-T transition
in exon 3 of the MAX gene, resulting in an arg33-to-ter (R33X)
substitution. Tumor tissue showed LOH of maternal chromosome 14q.

.0005
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO
MAX, 1-BP DEL, 185A

In a 47-year-old woman with bilateral nonmalignant pheochromocytoma
(171300), Comino-Mendez et al. (2011) identified a heterozygous 1-bp
deletion (185delA) in exon 4 of the MAX gene, resulting in a frameshift
and premature termination. Tumor tissue showed LOH of maternal
chromosome 14q.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

GPCR41 (607882) and GPCR42 act as receptors for porcine endogenous
retrovirus subgroup A (PERV-A).

The water-soluble vitamin riboflavin is converted to the coenzymes
flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and
is essential for normal cellular functions. SLC52A1, or RFT1, is a
transmembrane protein that mediates cellular uptake of riboflavin
(summary by Yao et al., 2010).

CLONING

By database screening for homologs of GPCR41, Ericsson et al. (2003)
identified GPCR42, which they designated PAR2. They cloned full-length
PAR2 from a 293-cell cDNA library. The deduced 448-amino acid protein is
a putative G protein-coupled receptor and contains 10 or 11 putative
transmembrane regions similar to other gammaretrovirus receptors. PAR2
shares significant homology with PAR1 and with PAR proteins from baboon,
pig, and mouse. Northern blot analysis using a probe that did not
differentiate between PAR1 and PAR2 detected expression in all tissues
examined, with the possible exception of bladder. Highest expression was
in testis. RT-PCR detected PAR1 and PAR2 expression in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of 11 healthy volunteers. Confocal microscopy detected
expression of fluorescence-tagged PAR2 at the plasma membrane and in the
perinuclear region of transfected rabbit corneal fibroblasts.

Using real-time PCR, Yao et al. (2010) detected highly specific RFT1
expression in placenta. Much lower expression was detected in small
intestine, thymus, and trachea, with little to none in other tissues
examined. Fluorescence-tagged RFT1 was expressed in the plasma membrane
of transfected HEK293 cells.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ericsson et al. (2003) mapped the GPR172B
gene to chromosome 17.

Hartz (2012) mapped the SLC52A1 gene to chromosome 17p13.2 based on an
alignment of the SLC52A1 sequence (GenBank GENBANK AK000922) with the
genomic sequence (GRCh37).

GENE FUNCTION

Ericsson et al. (2003) determined that expression of PAR1 or PAR2 in
transfected rabbit corneal fibroblasts and mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts
mediated both the entry and the productive replication of PERV-A.
Expression of PAR1 and PAR2 did not alter the sensitivity of the rabbit
cells to PERV-B or -C. The results suggested that PAR2 may mediate a
higher level of PERV infection than PAR1. Ericsson et al. (2003) noted
that the presence of these PERV-A receptors highlights a risk faced by
xenotransplant recipients.

Using transfected HEK293 cells, Yao et al. (2010) showed that RFT1, RFT2
(SLC52A3; 613350), and RFT3 (SLC52A2; 607882) mediated uptake of
radiolabeled riboflavin in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.
All 3 transporters also mediated riboflavin uptake independent of
extracellular Na+ and Cl-. RFT2, but not RFT1 or RFT3, showed reduced
riboflavin uptake when extracellular pH was increased from 5.4 to 8.4.
For all 3, radiolabeled riboflavin transport was completely inhibited by
excess unlabeled riboflavin and lumiflavine, and modestly inhibited by
FMN. FAD slightly but significantly inhibited RFT3-mediated riboflavin
uptake. Little to no effect was observed with other riboflavin analogs,
D-ribose, organic ions, or other vitamins.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a woman with riboflavin deficiency (RBFVD; 615026) who had an infant
with transient neonatal riboflavin deficiency (Chiong et al., 2007), Ho
et al. (2011) identified a de novo heterozygous 1.9-kb deletion within
the SLC52A1 gene (607883.0001), predicted to result in
haploinsufficiency. The infant did not carry the deletion. These
findings confirmed that the transient clinical and metabolic
abnormalities in the infant were the result of maternal riboflavin
deficiency.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RIBOFLAVIN DEFICIENCY
SLC52A1, 1.9-KB DEL

In a woman with riboflavin deficiency (RBFVD; 615026), Ho et al. (2011)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1.9-kb deletion in the SLC52A1 gene,
resulting in the deletion of exons 2 and 3 and predicted to cause
haploinsufficiency. The woman was clinically asymptomatic, but showed
biochemical evidence of riboflavin deficiency, manifest as increased
serum acylcarnitines. She was originally ascertained (Chiong et al.,
2007) after her newborn daughter presented soon after birth with poor
suck, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. The child had dicarboxylic
aciduria and elevated plasma acylcarnitine levels, initially thought to
be consistent with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD;
231680). Treatment with oral riboflavin resulted in complete resolution
of the clinical and biochemical findings. The findings were consistent
with transient neonatal riboflavin deficiency secondary to maternal
riboflavin deficiency that was exacerbated during pregnancy. The infant
did not carry the deletion.

605515	TITLE *605515 FORKHEAD BOX P1; FOXP1
;;GLUTAMINE-RICH FACTOR 1; QRF1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

FOXP1 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a critical role in
monocyte differentiation and macrophage function (Shi et al., 2008).

CLONING

Li and Tucker (1993) cloned a glutamine-rich factor, which they
designated QRF1, that was expressed preferentially at the terminal
differentiation stage of B cells and in skeletal muscle. The deduced
707-amino acid QRF1 protein contains an 84-amino acid segment that shows
significant sequence homology with the DNA-binding domains of the
hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead (see FOXA1; 602294) family of
proteins.

By expression cloning using blood and testis cDNA libraries to identify
the target of a monoclonal antibody (JC12), Banham et al. (2001)
obtained a full-length cDNA encoding FOXP1. The predicted 677-amino acid
protein contains coiled-coil, glutamine-rich, and serine/threonine-rich
domains in its N-terminal half; a central zinc finger domain; and
coiled-coil, serine/threonine/proline-rich, winged helix, and acidic
domains in its C-terminal half. FOXP1 also has numerous putative
phosphorylation sites, 2 nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in its
C-terminal half, and 2 PEST motif in its C-terminal acidic region.
Multiple-tissue array analysis showed ubiquitous expression of FOXP1 in
normal adult and fetal tissues, with highest expression in lymphoid and
gastrointestinal tissues. Immunohistochemistry showed that FOXP1 protein
was widely expressed, with a predominantly nuclear localization, in
normal tissues.

Wang et al. (2003) stated that there are 4 splice variants of mouse
Foxp1, designated Foxp1a through Foxp1d. They identified and cloned
Foxp1d, which encodes a Foxp1 isoform lacking the N-terminal
polyglutamine domain found in Foxp1a and Foxp1b. Northern blot analysis
and RNase protection assays showed tissue-specific expression of all 4
variants in mouse. Northern blot analysis of human tissues detected
tissue-specific expression of FOXP1 variants, with highest levels in
peripheral blood lymphocytes and in caudate nucleus of brain. Western
blot analysis detected variable expression of Foxp1a, Foxp1c, and Foxp1d
in mouse tissues, with high expression of all 3 isoforms in lung.

GENE FUNCTION

Wang et al. (2003) found that mouse Foxp1a, Foxp1c, Foxp1d, and the
related Foxp2 (605317) protein bound a 7-nucleotide core sequence,
TATTT(G/A)T. These Foxp proteins repressed gene transcription via
binding to this consensus site, which was identified within the SV40 and
IL2 (147680) promoters. In some cases, the strength of Foxp1 repression
was mediated by the polyglutamine domain. Mouse Foxp1 proteins also
formed homodimers or heterodimers with subfamily members, and the
conserved C2H2 zinc finger and leucine zipper motifs mediated
dimerization.

Using genetic manipulations, Rousso et al. (2008) demonstrated that
Foxp1 established the pattern of LIM-homeodomain protein (see 601999)
expression in embryonic mice and, accordingly, organized motor axon
projections, their connectivity with peripheral targets, and the
establishment of motor pools. Hox proteins (see 142950) dictated the
pattern of Foxp1 expression in spinal cord, and both Foxp1 and Hox were
required for segment-appropriate generation of motor columns and pools
in mouse.

Shi et al. (2008) generated transgenic mice overexpressing human FOXP1
in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. Circulating blood monocytes from
these mice had reduced expression of macrophage colony-stimulating
factor receptor (CSF1R; 164770), impaired migratory capacity, and
diminished accumulation as splenic macrophages. Macrophage functions
were globally impaired, and osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption were
attenuated. Forced overexpression of Csf1r reversed many of the
deficits, suggesting that repression of Csf1r is likely the dominant
mechanism responsible for FOXP1 effects on monocyte differentiation and
macrophage function.

- Association of FOXP1 With Cancer

By analysis of a tumor/normal tissue expression array, Banham et al.
(2001) found that expression of FOXP1 was lower in colon tumors and
higher in stomach and prostate tumors compared with matched normal
tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed frequent loss of
expression, increased expression, and cytoplasmic mislocalization of the
predominantly nuclear FOXP1 protein in solid tumors.

By immunohistochemical analysis of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (BCL)
tissue microarray, Banham et al. (2005) found that untreated patients
with a high percentage of FOXP1-positive nuclei had significantly
reduced survival and earlier progression compared with FOXP1-negative
patients.

Of 275 BCLs, Haralambieva et al. (2005) found that only 5 (3
gastrointestinal, 1 thyroid, and 1 cervical lymph node) carried a
chromosomal breakpoint in the FOXP1 gene and strong nuclear FOXP1
expression. All were diffuse large BCLs rather than marginal zone BCLs.
Haralambieva et al. (2005) concluded that genetic alterations at 3p13
are associated with strong FOXP1 expression.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Banham et al. (2001) mapped the FOXP1 gene
to chromosome 3p14.1.

CYTOGENETICS

Streubel et al. (2005) noted that 3 chromosomal translocations,
t(11;18)(q21;q21), t(14;18)(q32;q21), and t(1;14)(p22;q32), are
associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. They
identified a t(3;14)(p14;q32) in a case of MALT lymphoma of the thyroid.
FISH studies showed that the IGH locus (147100) was rearranged, and
long-distance inverse PCR identified FOXP1 as the partner gene on
chromosome 3. Using FISH assays to screen 91 MALT lymphomas negative for
3 common translocations, Streubel et al. (2005) identified
t(3;14)(p14;q32) in 9 cases (3 thyroid, 4 ocular adnexa, and 2 skin).
Most t(3;14)(p14;q32)-positive MALT lymphomas also harbored additional
genetic abnormalities, such as trisomy 3. All 4 of the MALT-associated
translocations were mutually exclusive. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed
upregulated expression of FOXP1 in MALT cases with t(3;14)(p14;q32) or
trisomy 3. Streubel et al. (2005) concluded that FOXP1 is a
translocation partner of IGH in a site-dependent subset of MALT
lymphomas.

Carr et al. (2010) reported a boy with severe speech delay and delayed
motor development (see 613670) who carried a de novo heterozygous 1.0-Mb
interstitial deletion of chromosome 3p14.1 that involved only the FOXP1
gene. The phenotype was confounded by a Chiari I malformation, which was
surgically corrected at age 30 months. The patient had delayed gross
motor skills and walked at 16 months. After surgery for the Chiari
malformation, he had some improvement in motor skills. The most
significant feature was speech delay with limited verbal output and
difficulty in articulating entire words and multisyllabic speech,
although he did not have a deficit in oromotor coordination. At age 4
years, he developed staring spells with motor arrest associated with
epileptiform discharges. He had mild dysmorphic facial features,
including broad forehead, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral
fissures, ptosis, short nose, broad nasal tip, and smooth philtrum. Carr
et al. (2010) concluded that FOXP1 may play a role in the development of
verbal and motor skills.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Hamdan et al. (2010) identified 2 different de novo heterozygous
mutations in the FOXP1 gene (605515.0001 and 605515.0002, respectively)
in 2 unrelated children of French Canadian origin with moderate mental
retardation, expressive language deficits, and autistic features
(613670). The first mutation (605515.0001) was a small deletion found
using array-based comparative genomic hybridization of a cohort of 80
patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 30 with intellectual
disability. The second mutation (R525X; 605515.0002) was found by direct
sequencing of the FOXP1 gene in a cohort of 110 patients with
intellectual disability, 84 with ASD, and 51 with both. Hamdan et al.
(2010) chose to examine the FOXP1 gene specifically because of the role
of the FOXP2 gene (605317) in a speech and language disorder (SPCH1;
602081); patients with intellectual disability and ASD often show
language impairment. The results indicated that disruption of FOXP1 has
a global impact on brain development.

ANIMAL MODEL

Hu et al. (2006) found that mice lacking Foxp1 died at embryonic day
14.5 due to heart valve and outflow tract abnormalities. Reconstitution
of Rag2 (179616)-deficient mice with Foxp1 -/- or Foxp1 +/- fetal liver
cells resulted in decreased mature B cells, but normal thymocytes, in
the recipients. Foxp1 -/- pro-B cells had reduced IgM, Rag1 (179615),
and Rag2 expression, and V(D)J rearrangement was also impaired in Foxp1
-/- B cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA analyses showed that
Foxp1 bound to Foxp site-2 (Fkh2) in the Erag enhancer, which is
upstream of Rag2, in a B-lineage specific way. Hu et al. (2006)
concluded that FOXP1 influences B-cell development at an early stage,
and that FOXP1 deficiency results in a phenotype that resembles double
haploinsufficiency of E2A (TCF3; 147141) and EBF (164343).

Feng et al. (2010) generated mice with a conditional deletion of Foxp1
in double-positive thymocytes and found that peripheral Cd4 (see 186940)
and Cd8 (see 186910) cells also lacked Foxp1 and that single-positive
thymocytes acquired an activated phenotype in thymus. Peripheral cells
also exhibited an activated phenotype and increased apoptosis and
readily produced cytokines upon T-cell receptor engagement. Feng et al.
(2010) concluded that FOXP1 is an essential transcriptional regulator
for thymocyte development and the generation of quiescent naive T cells.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, 390-KB DEL

In a French Canadian girl who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 390-kb intragenic deletion in the
FOXP1 gene. The deletion encompassed exons 4 to 14 of the longest FOXP1
isoform, including the translation initiation site and leucine zipper
and zinc finger domains important for transcriptional activity.

.0002
MENTAL RETARDATION WITH LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT AND AUTISTIC FEATURES
FOXP1, ARG525TER

In a French Canadian boy who had mental retardation with language
impairment and autistic features (613670), Hamdan et al. (2010)
identified a de novo heterozygous 1573C-T transition in the FOXP1 gene,
resulting in an arg525-to-ter (R525X) substitution. The mutation was
predicted to abolish the last 152 residues of the protein, including
part of the forkhead DNA-binding (FHD) domain and a conserved nuclear
localization signal. The mutation was not found in 570 controls. In
vitro functional expression studies in HEK293 cells showed that the
R525X mutant impaired the transcriptional repression ability of FOXP1,
consistent with a loss of function.

609178	TITLE *609178 MIS12, S. POMBE, HOMOLOG OF; MIS12
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By searching for sequences similar to yeast Mis12, followed by PCR of a
HeLa cell cDNA library, Goshima et al. (2003) cloned MIS12. The deduced
205-amino acid protein contains 2 conserved blocks in its N-terminal 100
amino acids, followed by a coiled-coil region of about 50 amino acids.
Endogenous HeLa cell MIS12 had an apparent molecular mass of about 25
kD. Immunolocalization showed MIS12 colocalized at kinetochores with
CENPA (117139) and CENPC (117141), and its position during the cell
cycle was that of a typical kinetochore protein. The level of MIS12 did
not fluctuate during the cell cycle.

GENE FUNCTION

Using RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells, Goshima et al. (2003)
demonstrated that reduced MIS12 resulted in misaligned metaphase
chromosomes, abnormally extended metaphase spindle length, lagging
anaphase chromosomes, and interphase micronuclei without mitotic delay.
Spindle checkpoint protein MAD2 (601467) temporally localized at
kinetochores at early mitotic stages after MIS12 RNAi. Kinetochore
localization of MIS12 was unaffected by CENPA RNAi.

Following MIS12 overexpression in HeLa cells, Obuse et al. (2004)
immunoprecipitated MIS12 in a kinetochore-associated complex that
contained PMF1 (609176), DC8 (609174), C20ORF172 (609175), and HP1-alpha
(CBX5; 604478). ZWINT (609177) also associated with the complex at
kinetochores during mitosis. Immunoprecipitation of transfected cells
indicated that MIS12 could form stable complexes with C20ORF172 and DC8.
Much weaker interaction was detected between MIS12 and ZWINT. Exclusion
chromatography revealed 3 peaks containing MIS12 and C20ORF172, but only
the middle peak, which had a mass of 669 kD, contained HP1-alpha. MIS12
knockdown by RNAi abolished the kinetochore association of ZWINT, DC8,
and C20ORF172.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the MIS12
gene to chromosome 17 (TMAP SHGC-36031).

604472	TITLE *604472 TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR LIGAND SUPERFAMILY, MEMBER 13; TNFSF13
;;APRIL;;
TNF- AND APOL-RELATED LEUKOCYTE EXPRESSED LIGAND 2; TALL2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands play
important roles in various physiologic and pathologic processes,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, and death, and modulation
of immune responses. By screening EST databases, Hahne et al. (1998)
cloned a novel TNF cDNA, TNFSF13, which they called APRIL, for 'a
proliferation-inducing ligand.' The full-length cDNA TNFSF13 clone
encodes a 250-amino acid protein with a predicted 28-amino acid
cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and an
extracellular domain of 201 amino acids with no signal peptide. There is
only 1 N-linked glycosylation site. The sequence of the extracellular
domain shows 21% homology with TNFSF6 (134638) and 20% homology with
TNFA (191160). Northern blot analysis revealed weak expression
restricted to a few tissues: transcripts of 2.1 and 2.4 kb in prostate
and a transcript of 1.8 kb in peripheral blood leukocytes. All tumor
cell lines, however, strongly expressed the TNFSF13 2.1-kb transcript,
and expression of extracellular or full-length TNFSF13 led to increased
proliferation of various cell lines.

Shu et al. (1999) identified the same gene, which they designated TALL2.
TALL2 shares about 35% sequence identity with TALL1 (BLYS, or TNFSF13B;
603969) in the C terminus.

By RACE, RT-PCR, and screening of a T-cell cDNA library, Pradet-Balade
et al. (2002) isolated a hybrid transcript formed by intergenic splicing
of exons 1 through 6 of TWEAK (TNFSF12; 602695) to exons 2 through 6 of
APRIL. See 602695 for further information on the protein encoded by the
TWEAK/APRIL transcript, which Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) called
TWEPRIL.

Using Northern blot analysis, Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) found that
relative expression of the 1.9-kb APRIL transcript was about 6-fold
higher than that of the 2.5-kb TWEPRIL transcript in resting T cells.
However, in activated T cells, both transcripts were expressed at
similar levels. A similar expression pattern for APRIL and TWEPRIL was
detected in CD4 (186940)-positive and CD8 (see 186910)-positive T-cell
subpopulations. TWEAK expression was similar between resting and
activated T cells. TWEAK was found predominantly in ribosome-free
fractions in both resting and activated T cells, whereas APRIL and
TWEPRIL increased their association with polyribosomes following T-cell
activation, suggesting that translational efficiency of APRIL and
TWEPRIL increases upon T-cell activation.

GENE FUNCTION

Seyler et al. (2005) analyzed synovial tissue specimens from 72 patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (180300) for TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B production
and TNFSF13/TNFSF13B receptor expression. Synovitis with ectopic
germinal centers present had the highest levels of TNFSF13, produced
exclusively by CD83 (604534)-positive dendritic cells; TNFSF13B was
present in similar levels in all types of synovitis (with or without
germinal centers or T cell-B cell aggregates) and was produced
exclusively from CD68 (153634)-positive macrophages. In synovitis with
germinal centers, inhibiting TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B with a TACI
(TNFRSF13B; 604907):Fc fusion protein resulted in destruction of the
germinal centers and marked inhibition of IFN-gamma (147570) and Ig
transcription, whereas similar inhibition in the aggregate and diffuse
types of synovitis enhanced IFN-gamma production and did not affect Ig
levels. These differential immunomodulatory effects correlated with the
presence of TACI-positive T cells in aggregate and diffuse synovitis and
their absence in synovitis with germinal centers. Seyler et al. (2005)
proposed that TNFSF13 and TNFSF13B regulate B-cell as well as T-cell
function and have both pro- and antiinflammatory effects in rheumatoid
arthritis.

Both BLYS and APRIL have been described as homotrimeric molecules, a
feature common to many members of the TNF superfamily. Using ELISA
analysis, Roschke et al. (2002) found that patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700), rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter syndrome, psoriatic
arthritis (see 607507), polymyositis (see 160750), and ankylosing
spondylitis (106300) had significantly higher levels of BLYS/APRIL
heterotrimers than did controls. Roschke et al. (2002) proposed that
BLYS/APRIL heterotrimers may play a role in rheumatic and other
autoimmune diseases, and that other members of the TNF ligand
superfamily may also form active soluble heterotrimers.

Using cell-based, biochemical, and structural studies, Hymowitz et al.
(2005) characterized interactions between APRIL and TACI. They found
that the short isoform of human TACI, which lacks cysteine-rich domain-1
(CRD1), was still functional for signaling and that CRD2 of TACI was
sufficient for high-affinity binding to either murine April or human
BAFF (TNFSF13B). The solution structure of CRD2 of TACI revealed a
compact domain and additional ligand-binding determinants. Cocrystal
structures of murine April bound to CRD2 of human TACI or to human BCMA
(TNFRSF17; 109545) showed large interfaces and revealed key differences
that likely influence ligand-binding affinity and specificity.

Ingold et al. (2005) showed that the TNF homology domain of mouse and
human APRIL bound BCMA and TACI, whereas a basic sequence (QKQKKQ) close
to the N terminus of the mature protein bound negatively charged
sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Although T-cell
lines bound little APRIL, ectopic expression of glycosaminoglycan-rich
syndecans (see SDC1; 186355) or glypicans (see GPC1; 600395) conferred
on these cells a high binding capacity that was completely dependent on
the N-terminal basic sequence of APRIL. Moreover, SDC1-positive plasma
cells and proteoglycan-rich nonhematopoietic cells displayed high
specific, heparin-sensitive binding to APRIL. Inhibition of BAFF and
APRIL, but not BAFF alone, prevented survival and/or migration of newly
formed plasma cells to bone marrow. In addition, costimulation of B-cell
proliferation by APRIL was only effective upon APRIL oligomerization.
Ingold et al. (2005) proposed that APRIL binding to the extracellular
matrix or to proteoglycan-positive cells induces APRIL oligomerization,
which is the prerequisite for triggering TACI- and/or BCMA-mediated
activation, migration, and survival signals.

Using flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and immunohistochemical
analysis, Huard et al. (2008) found that APRIL was expressed on
recruited neutrophils and accumulated on subepithelial heparan sulfate
proteoglycans in upper (e.g., tonsils) and lower (e.g., lamina propria)
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and contributed to survival of
plasma cells. Mice lacking April had less-persistent mucosal humoral
immunity. Huard et al. (2008) proposed that inflammation-recruited
neutrophils may create plasma cell niches in MALT to sustain local
antibody production.

GENE STRUCTURE

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the TNFSF13 gene contains 6
exons.

MAPPING

Pradet-Balade et al. (2002) determined that the transcriptional start
site of the TNFSF13 gene lies 878 bp downstream of the TNFSF12 gene on
chromosome 17p13.1.

ANIMAL MODEL

By treating mice with TACI-Ig, Gross et al. (2001) determined that BLYS
and APRIL are required for the development of both transitional (T2) and
mature B lymphocytes. TACI-Ig-treated mice also had less circulating
immunoglobulin and produced less collagen-specific antibody. TACI-Ig
treatment inhibited the development of collagen-induced rheumatoid
arthritis. Gross et al. (2001) proposed that TACI-Ig may have a role in
both the prevention and treatment of autoimmune disease mediated by
pathogenic autoantibodies.

Stein et al. (2002) created mice expressing human APRIL as a transgene
in T cells. These mice appeared normal. Transgenic T cells showed
enhanced survival in vitro and enhanced survival of staphylococcal
enterotoxin B-reactive Cd4-positive T cells in vivo, and both of these
responses correlated with elevated Bcl2 levels. Analysis of humoral
responses to T cell-dependent antigens in the transgenic mice indicated
that APRIL affected IgM responses, but not IgG responses. In contrast, T
cell-independent type-2 (TI-2) humoral responses were enhanced in APRIL
transgenic mice. As TACI had been reported to be indispensable for TI-2
antibody formation, Stein et al. (2002) concluded that APRIL-TACI
interactions have a role in generating the TI-2 response and that APRIL
is involved in the induction and/or maintenance of T- and B-cell
responses.

To investigate the role of APRIL in immunity, Castigli et al. (2004)
generated April-deficient mice. April -/- mice had normal T and B
lymphocyte development, normal T and B cell proliferation in vitro, but
increased numbers of CD4+ effector/memory T cells and increased IgG
responses to T-dependent antigens. Serum IgA levels were significantly
decreased, and serum IgA antibody responses to mucosal immunization with
T-dependent antigens and to type 1 T-independent antigens were impaired
in April -/- mice. The results suggested that APRIL downregulates T
cell-dependent antibody responses and promotes IgA class switching.

DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The nucleosome is the basic repeat unit of eukaryotic chromatin. The
nucleosome core particle consists of an octamer formed by 2 each of the
core histones H2A (see 613499), H2B (see 609904), H3 (see 602810), and
H4, around which DNA is wrapped. A fifth histone, histone H1 (see
142709), is bound to the linker DNA between nucleosomes and is important
for the higher order structure of chromatin. HIST1H4A is a core histone
H4 (summary by Marzluff et al. (2002) and Foster and Downs (2005)).

GENE FAMILY

All core histones, including H4 histones, contain a histone fold domain,
which is central to the nucleosome core structure, and a flexible
N-terminal domain that protrudes from the nucleosome core particle. Like
other histones, H4 histones can be subgrouped according to their
temporal expression. Replication-dependent histones, such as HIST1H4A
through HIST1H4L (602831) and HIST2H4A (142750) are mainly expressed
during S phase. In contrast, replication-independent histones, or
replacement variant histones, can be expressed throughout the cell
cycle. Most replication-dependent H4 histone genes, as well as other
core histone genes, are located within histone gene cluster-1 (HIST1) on
chromosome 6p22-p21. Two other histone gene clusters, HIST2 and HIST3,
are located on chromosomes 1q21 and 1q42, respectively. HIST2 contains 1
replication-dependent H4 gene, HIST2H4A, and there are no H4 genes in
HIST3. An additional H4 gene, HIST4H4 (615069), is located on chromosome
12p13.1. In mouse, the Hist1, Hist2, and Hist3 gene clusters are located
on chromosomes 13A2-A3, 3F1-F2, and 11B2, respectively. All
replication-dependent histone genes are intronless, and they encode
mRNAs that lack a poly(A) tail, ending instead in a conserved stem-loop
sequence. Unlike replication-dependent histone genes,
replication-independent histone genes are solitary genes that are
located on chromosomes apart from any other H1 or core histone genes.
Some replication-independent histone genes contain introns and encode
mRNAs with poly(A) tails. All human and mouse H4 histone genes encode
the same protein (summary by Marzluff et al. (2002) and Foster and Downs
(2005)).

CLONING

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) identified the
mouse and human HIST1H4A genes. All mouse and human H4 genes, including
HIST1H4A, encode the same protein.

MAPPING

By analysis of a YAC contig from chromosome 6p21.3, Albig et al. (1997)
characterized a cluster of 35 histone genes, including H4/a.

By genomic sequence analysis, Marzluff et al. (2002) determined that the
HIST1 cluster on chromosome 6p22-p21 contains 55 histone genes,
including 12 H4 genes. The HIST1H4A gene is the most telomeric H4 gene
within the HIST1 cluster. The HIST1 cluster spans over 2 Mb and includes
2 large gaps (over 250 kb each) where there are no histone genes, but
many other genes. The organization of histone genes in the mouse Hist1
cluster on chromosome 13A2-A3 is essentially identical to that in human
HIST1. The HIST2 cluster on chromosome 1q21 contains 6 histone genes,
including 1 H4 gene (HIST2H4A; 142750), and the HIST3 cluster on
chromosome 1q42 contains 3 histone genes, but no H4 genes. Hist2 and
Hist3 are located on mouse chromosomes 3F1-F2 and 11B2, respectively. An
additional H4 gene, HIST4H4 (615069), is located on human chromosome
12p13.1 and mouse chromosome 6G1.

GENE FUNCTION

- H4 Histone Family

As reviewed by Felsenfeld (1992), detailed biochemical definition of the
protein complexes that regulate gene transcription led to reemergence of
questions concerning the role of histones. He reviewed evidence
suggesting that transcriptional activation requires that transcription
factors successfully compete with histones for binding to promoters.

CpG island hypermethylation and global genomic hypomethylation are
common epigenetic features of cancer cells. Fraga et al. (2005)
characterized posttranslational modifications to histone H4 in a
comprehensive panel of normal tissues, cancer cell lines, and primary
tumors. They found that cancer cells had a loss of monoacetylated and
trimethylated forms of histone H4. These changes appeared early and
accumulated during the tumorigenic process, as they showed in a mouse
model of multistage skin carcinogenesis. The losses occurred
predominantly at the acetylated lys16 and trimethylated lys20 residues
of histone H4 and were associated with the hypomethylation of DNA
repetitive sequences, a well-known characteristic of cancer cells. Fraga
et al. (2005) suggested that the global loss of monoacetylation and
trimethylation of histone H4 is a common hallmark of human tumor cells.

Wang et al. (2001) reported the purification, molecular identification,
and functional characterization of a histone H4-specific
methyltransferase, PRMT1 (602950), a protein arginine methyltransferase.
PRMT1 specifically methylates arginine-3 of histone H4 in vitro and in
vivo. Methylation of arg3 by PRMT1 facilitates subsequent acetylation of
H4 tails by p300 (602700). However, acetylation of H4 inhibits its
methylation by PRMT1. Most important, a mutation in the
S-adenosyl-L-methionine-binding site of PRMT1 substantially crippled its
nuclear receptor coactivator activity. Wang et al. (2001) concluded that
their findings reveal arg3 of H4 as a novel methylation site by PRMT1
and indicate that arg3 methylation plays an important role in
transcriptional regulation.

Agalioti et al. (2002) found that only a small subset of lysines in
histones H3 (see 602810) and H4 are acetylated in vivo by the GCN5
acetyltransferase (see 602301) during activation of the interferon-beta
gene (IFNB; 147640). Reconstitution of recombinant nucleosomes bearing
mutations in these lysine residues revealed the cascade of gene
activation via a point-by-point interpretation of the histone code
through the ordered recruitment of bromodomain-containing transcription
complexes. Acetylation of histone H4 lys8 mediates recruitment of the
SWI/SNF complex (see 603111), whereas acetylation of lys9 and lys14 in
histone H3 is critical for the recruitment of TFIID (see 313650). Thus,
the information contained in the DNA address of the enhancer is
transferred to the histone N termini by generating novel adhesive
surfaces required for the recruitment of transcription complexes.

Using deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry coupled with hydrodynamic
measures, Black et al. (2004) demonstrated that CENPA (117139) and
histone H4 form subnucleosomal tetramers that are more compact and
conformationally more rigid than the corresponding tetramers of histones
H3 and H4. Substitution into histone H3 of the domain of CENPA
responsible for compaction was sufficient to direct it to centromeres.
Thus, Black et al. (2004) concluded that the centromere-targeting domain
of CENPA confers a unique structural rigidity to the nucleosomes into
which it assembles, and is likely to have a role in maintaining
centromere identity.

Acetylation of histone H4 on lysine-16 (H4-K16Ac) is a prevalent and
reversible posttranslational chromatin modification in eukaryotes. To
characterize the structural and functional role of this mark,
Shogren-Knaak et al. (2006) used a native chemical ligation strategy to
generate histone H4 that was homogeneously acetylated at K16. The
incorporation of this modified histone into nucleosomal arrays inhibited
the formation of compact 30-nanometer-like fibers and impeded the
ability of chromatin to form cross-fiber interactions. H4-K16Ac also
inhibited the ability of the adenosine triphosphate-utilizing chromatin
assembly and remodeling enzyme ACF to mobilize a mononucleosome,
indicating that this single histone modification modulates both higher
order chromatin structure and functional interactions between a
nonhistone protein and the chromatin fiber.

In a screen for endogenous tumor-associated T-cell responses in a
primary mouse model of prostatic adenocarcinoma, Savage et al. (2008)
identified a naturally arising CD8+ T cell response that is reactive to
a peptide derived from histone H4. Despite the ubiquitous nature of
histones, T cell recognition of histone H4 peptide was specifically
associated with the presence of prostate cancer in these mice. Thus,
Savage et al. (2008) concluded that the repertoire of antigens
recognized by tumor-infiltrating T cells is broader than previously
thought and includes peptides derived from ubiquitous self antigens that
are normally sequestered from immune detection.

Dang et al. (2009) reported an age-associated decrease in yeast Sir2
(see SIRT1, 604479) protein abundance accompanied by an increase in
histone H4 lysine-16 acetylation and loss of histones at specific
subtelomeric regions in replicatively old yeast cells, which results in
compromised transcriptional silencing at these loci. Antagonizing
activities of Sir2 and Sas2, a histone acetyltransferase, regulate the
replicative life span through histone H4 lys16 at subtelomeric regions.
Dang et al. (2009) concluded that this pathway, distinct from existing
aging models for yeast, may represent an evolutionarily conserved
function of sirtuins in regulation of replicative aging by maintenance
of intact telomeric chromatin.

Xu et al. (2010) reported that significant amounts of histone H3.3 (see
601128)-H4 tetramers split in vivo, whereas most H3.1 (see 602810)-H4
tetramers remain intact during mitotic division. Inhibiting DNA
replication-dependent deposition greatly reduced the level of splitting
events, which suggested that (i) the replication-independent H3.3
deposition pathway proceeds largely by cooperatively incorporating 2 new
H3.3-H4 dimers, and (ii) the majority of splitting events occurred
during replication-dependent deposition. Xu et al. (2010) concluded that
'silent' histone modifications within large heterochromatic regions are
maintained by copying modifications from neighboring preexisting
histones without the need for H3-H4 splitting events.

Qi et al. (2010) provided multiple lines of evidence establishing PHF8
(300560) as the first monomethyl histone H4 lysine-20 (H4K20me1)
demethylase, with additional activities towards histone H3K9me1 and me2.
PHF8 is located around the transcriptional start sites of approximately
7,000 RefSeq genes and in gene bodies and intergenic regions. PHF8
depletion resulted in upregulation of H4K20me1 and H3K9me1 at the
transcriptional start site and H3K9me2 in the nontranscriptional start
sites, respectively, demonstrating differential substrate specificities
at different target locations. PHF8 positively regulates gene
expression, which is dependent on its H3K4me3-binding PHD and catalytic
domains. Importantly, patient mutations significantly compromised PHF8
catalytic function. PHF8 regulates cell survival in the zebrafish brain
and jaw development, thus providing a potentially relevant biologic
context for understanding the clinical symptoms associated with PHF8
patients. Lastly, genetic and molecular evidence supported a model
whereby PHF8 regulates zebrafish neuronal cell survival and jaw
development in part by directly regulating the expression of the
homeodomain transcription factor MSX1/MSXB (605558), which functions
downstream of multiple signaling and developmental pathways.

Liu et al. (2010) reported that PHF8, while using multiple substrates,
including H3K9me1/2 and H3K27me2, also functions as an H4K20me1
demethylase. PHF8 is recruited to promoters by its PHD domain based on
interaction with H3K4me2/3 and controls G1-S transition in conjunction
with E2F1, HCF1 (300019), and SET1A (611052), at least in part, by
removing the repressive H4K20me1 mark from a subset of E2F1-regulated
gene promoters. Phosphorylation-dependent PHF8 dismissal from chromatin
in prophase is apparently required for the accumulation of H4K20me1
during early mitosis, which might represent a component of the condensin
II loading process. Accordingly, the HEAT repeat clusters in 2
non-structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) condensin II subunits,
NCAPD3 (609276) and NCAPG2 (608532), are capable of recognizing
H4K20me1, and ChIP-Seq analysis demonstrated a significant overlap of
condensin II and H4K20me1 sites in mitotic HeLa cells. Thus, Liu et al.
(2010) concluded that the identification and characterization of an
H4K20me1 demethylase, PHF8, has revealed an intimate link between this
enzyme and 2 distinct events in cell cycle progression.

Fullgrabe et al. (2013) reported that induction of autophagy is coupled
to reduction of histone H4 lysine-16 acetylation (H4K16ac) through
downregulation of the histone acetyltransferase MOF (MYST1; 609912), and
demonstrated that this histone modification regulates the outcome of
autophagy. At a genomewide level, Fullgrabe et al. (2013) found that
H4K16 deactylation is associated predominantly with the downregulation
of autophagy-related genes. Antagonizing H4K16ac downregulation upon
autophagy induction results in the promotion of cell death. Fullgrabe et
al. (2013) concluded that their findings established that alteration in
a specific histone posttranslational modification during autophagy
affects the transcriptional regulation of autophagy-related genes and
initiates a regulatory feedback loop, which serves as a key determinant
of survival versus death responses upon autophagy induction.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

- Crystal Structure

Sekulic et al. (2010) reported the crystal structure of a subnucleosomal
heterotetramer, (CENP-A-H4)2 (CENP-A, 117139, in complex with histone
H4), that reveals 3 distinguishing properties encoded by the residues
that comprise the CENP-A targeting domain (CATD): (1) a CENP-A-CENP-A
interface that is substantially rotated relative to the H3-H3 interface;
(2) a protruding loop L1 of the opposite charge as that on H3; and (3)
strong hydrophobic contacts that rigidify the CENP-A-H4 interface.
Residues involved in the CENP-A-CENP-A rotation are required for
efficient incorporation into centromeric chromatin, indicating
specificity for an unconventional nucleosome shape. DNA topologic
analysis indicated that CENP-A-containing nucleosomes are octameric with
conventional left-handed DNA wrapping. Sekulic et al. (2010) concluded
that CENP-A marks centromere location by restructuring the nucleosome
from within its folded histone core.

Elsasser et al. (2012) reported the crystal structures of the DAXX
(603186) histone-binding domain with a histone H3.3-H4 dimer, including
mutants within DAXX and H3.3, together with in vitro and in vivo
functional studies that elucidated the principles underlying H3.3
recognition specificity. Occupying 40% of the histone surface-accessible
area, DAXX wraps around the H3.3-H4 dimer, with complex formation
accompanied by structural transitions in the H3.3-H4 histone fold. DAXX
uses an extended alpha-helical conformation to compete with major
interhistone, DNA, and ASF1 interaction sites. Elsasser et al. (2012)
concluded that their structural studies identified recognition elements
that read out H3.3-specific residues, and functional studies addressed
the contribution of gly90 in H3.3 and glu225 in DAXX to
chaperone-mediated H3.3 variant recognition specificity.

EVOLUTION

Histone IV genes are highly conserved across evolution. Delange and
Smith (1971) noted that, in their 110 amino acids, histone IV genes of
cattle and garden peas differ by only 2 residues.

Heintz et al. (1981) concluded that the human histone genes are
clustered in the genome but are not arranged into recognizable repeating
units. The lack of organization of the human histone genes (as
contrasted with those of invertebrates or of Xenopus laevis) may reflect
the diminished requirement for rapid synthesis of large quantities of
histone proteins during early mammalian development.

Kedes and Maxson (1981) found that the histone genes in man, mouse,
chicken, and toad show a dispersed topology; they are scattered and
separated by long stretches of nonhistone DNA. In an article subtitled
'Paradigm Lost,' the authors referred to 'this newly discovered
diaspora.'

NOMENCLATURE

Marzluff et al. (2002) provided a nomenclature for replication-dependent
histone genes located within the HIST1, HIST2, and HIST3 clusters. The
symbols for these genes all begin with HIST1, HIST2, or HIST3 according
to which cluster they are located in. The H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 genes
were named systematically according to their location within the HIST1,
HIST2, and HIST3 clusters. For example, HIST1H4A is the most telomeric
H4 gene within HIST1, and HIST1H4L (602831) is the most centromeric. In
contrast, the H1 genes, all of which are located within HIST1, were
named according to their mouse homologs. Thus, HIST1H1A (142709) is
homologous to mouse H1a, HIST1H1B (142711) is homologous to mouse H1b,
and so on.

HISTORY

Szabo et al. (1978) presented nucleic acid hybridization data indicating
that chromosome 7 carries gene(s) coding for histone H4 protein.
Steffensen (1979) presented evidence that all 5 histone genes in man are
clustered at 7q2. Yunis and Chandler (1979) located the histone genes to
bands 7q32-36 and the homologous chromosome segments in chimpanzee,
gorilla, and orangutan.

A clone containing a human histone gene cluster in the order
H3-H4-H1-H2A-H2B was isolated by Clark et al. (1981), as cited by
Hentschel and Birnstiel (1981). Sierra et al. (1982) likewise found an
arrangement of the histone genes different from that in the sea urchin
and Drosophila.

Carozzi et al. (1984) isolated an H1 histone gene from a 15-kb human DNA
genomic sequence. The presence of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 genes in this same
15-kb fragment demonstrated that these genes are clustered.

By study of mouse-human cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization, Green
et al. (1984) showed that H3 and H4 histone genes are on 1q, probably
1q21. From in situ hybridization, Tripputi et al. (1986) concluded that
histone genes map to at least 3 different chromosomes: 1, 6, and 12.
Some may be nonexpressed pseudogenes. They commented that the number of
histone genes is between 100 and 200. The histones have the distinction
of being the only proteins coded by repetitive DNA. Tanguay et al.
(1987) reported in situ hybridization data corroborating those of
Tripputi et al. (1986), using a heterologous probe containing the 5
histone genes of Drosophila. They found that the main concentrations of
grains were at 6p12-q21, 12q11-q22, and 1cen-q25. Allen et al. (1989)
reported the conflicting assignment of histones 3 and 4 to human
chromosome 6.

610276	TITLE *610276 PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL GLYCAN, CLASS X; PIGX
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a complex glycolipid that anchors
many proteins to the cell surface. PIGX is a subunit of a GPI
mannosyltransferase complex involved in the synthesis of the core GPI
structure in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Ashida et al., 2005).

CLONING

Ashida et al. (2005) cloned rat Pigx cDNA, which contained an unusual
CTG (leu) initiation codon. The deduced 252-amino acid protein has a
22-amino acid signal peptide, a C-terminal transmembrane region, and 2
N-glycosylation sites. Human and rat Pigx proteins share 77% sequence
identity. Pigx colocalized with an ER marker in transfected CHO cells.

GENE FUNCTION

Using coprecipitation experiments, Ashida et al. (2005) determined that
rat Pigx bound Pigm (610273). The expression of Pigm in CHO cells was
very low in the absence of coexpressed Pigx, suggesting that Pigx
stabilizes Pigm.

GENE STRUCTURE

Ashida et al. (2005) determined that the PIGX gene contains 6 exons and
spans 25 kb.

MAPPING

By genomic sequence analysis, Ashida et al. (2005) mapped the PIGX gene
to chromosome 3q29.

604665	TITLE *604665 COP9, SUBUNIT 3; COPS3
;;SGN3
DESCRIPTION To identify new components of the 26S proteasome, Seeger et al. (1998)
obtained peptide sequences from a 45-kD protein. By micropeptide
sequence analysis and probing of cDNA libraries, Seeger et al. (1998)
isolated a cDNA encoding COPS3, which they termed SGN3, for subunit 3 of
a novel 450-kD signalosome complex that also includes TRIP15 (604508),
COPS5 (604850), GPS1 (601934), and 4 other subunits. Sequence analysis
predicted that COPS3 is a 403-amino acid protein which contains regions
with homology to the 26S proteasome S3 regulatory subunit.
Autoradiographic analysis showed that the complex phosphorylates JUN
(165160), IKBA (164008), and the C-terminal part of the p105 precursor
of NFKB (164011). The 26S proteasome is not a phosphorylation target,
although immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the 450-kD
complex has a cytosolic localization, concentrated around the nucleus.

Elsea et al. (1999) reported the localization and partial
characterization of SGN3. They mapped the SGN3 gene to 17p11.2 by
somatic cell hybrid analysis. By analysis of genomic clones, they
further localized the SGN3 gene to the distal end of the Smith-Magenis
syndrome (SMS) critical region (182290), near marker D17S71. Although
SMS patients were haploinsufficient for SGN3, analyses showed that the
SGN3 protein was present at equivalent levels in patient and parental
control cells, and that the COP9 signalosome complex was assembled and
in normal quantities in transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from
patients. Elsea et al. (1999) concluded that SGN3 probably does not play
a significant role with respect to SMS, although its involvement could
not be ruled out since the importance of the COP9 signalosome in
embryogenesis or differentiation was not well understood.

609787	TITLE *609787 UBIQUITIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1; UBAP1
;;UBAP
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By screening the expression patterns of ESTs located in a region at
9p22-p21 undergoing loss of heterozygosity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC), Yang et al. (1999) identified an EST that is downregulated in
NPC. Using the clone for this EST and 5-prime RACE, Qian et al. (2001)
identified the full-length cDNA sequence, which they designated UBAP1.
The deduced 502-amino acid protein has a predicted molecular mass of 55
kD and contains 2 putative tandem UBA domains at the C terminus, a
coiled-coil domain, 2 possible N-glycosylation sites, 5 PKC
phosphorylation sites, 7 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and 3
N-myristoylation sites. Qian et al. (2001) also identified mouse Ubap1.
The human and mouse proteins share 90% sequence identity. Northern blot
analysis of human tissues detected ubiquitous expression of a 2.7-kb
transcript, with highest expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and
liver. RT-PCR of mouse tissues also revealed ubiquitous expression.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Using RT-PCR and direct sequencing, Qian et al. (2001) screened the NPC
cell line HNE1 and 10 primary NPCs for mutations in the UBAP1 gene. They
found no sequence alterations.

MAPPING

By sequence analysis, Qian et al. (2001) mapped the UBAP1 gene to
chromosome 9p22-p21.

;;RIBOSOMAL S6 KINASE 3; RSK3;;
MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 1C; MAPKAPK1C;;
MAPKAP KINASE 1C
DESCRIPTION Serine/threonine protein kinases in the ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family
have been implicated as signaling intermediates in the cellular response
to several growth factors. Moller et al. (1994) described the cloning
and characterization of 3 genes encoding 3 isoforms of ribosomal protein
S6 kinase, which they called HU1 (RPS6KA1; 601684), HU2 (RPS6KA2), and
HU3 (RPS6KA3; 300075). The partial HU2 cDNA (GenBank GENBANK L07598)
encodes a predicted protein containing 2 distinct consensus ATP-binding
site sequences. Northern blot and RNase protection analyses detected
major 7.5-kb and minor 3.5-kb HU2 transcripts in fibroblasts, skeletal
muscle, lymphocytes, and placenta.

Zhao et al. (1995) cloned a full-length cDNA encoding the RPS6KA2
isoform of ribosomal protein S6 kinase, which they designated RSK3. The
deduced 733-amino acid RSK3 protein has 84% and 75% sequence identity
with RSK2 (RPS6KA3) and RSK1 (RPS6KA1), respectively. RSK3 has a unique
N-terminal sequence which contains a putative bipartite nuclear
localization signal. Immunoblot analysis of human cell lysates detected
an 83-kD RSK protein. The authors demonstrated serum-stimulated nuclear
translocation of endogenous RSK3 in HeLa cells. RSK3 exhibited
growth-stimulated autophosphorylation and kinase activity; however, its
relative activity toward several known RSK substrates differed from the
activities of other RSKs. Unlike RSK1, RSK3 was not activated by ERK2
(PRKM1; 176948) in vitro. Northern blot analysis detected a single
6.5-kb RSK3 transcript in all tissues examined, with the highest
expression in lung and skeletal muscle.

Goustin (1998) reported that the RSK3 gene (GenBank GENBANK Z98049,
GENBANK AL022069) contains 217,693 bp from the transcriptional start
site to the polyadenylation signal. The gene has 21 exons, with an
88.1-kb intron between exons 1 and 2.

By analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Moller et al. (1994) mapped the
RPS6KA2 gene to chromosome 6. Zhao et al. (1995) refined the mapping to
6q27 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Zeniou et al. (2002) determined the expression of the RSK1, RSK2, and
RSK3 genes in various human tissues, during mouse embryogenesis, and in
mouse brain. The 3 RSK mRNAs were expressed in all human tissues and
brain regions tested, supporting functional redundancy. However,
tissue-specific variations in levels suggested that the proteins may
also serve specific roles. The mouse Rsk3 gene was prominently expressed
in the developing neural and sensory tissues, whereas Rsk1 gene
expression was the strongest in various other tissues with high
proliferative activity, suggesting distinct roles during development. In
adult mouse brain, the highest levels of Rsk2 expression were observed
in regions with high synaptic activity, including the neocortex, the
hippocampus, and Purkinje cells. The authors suggested that in these
areas, which are essential to cognitive function and learning, the RSK1
and RSK3 genes may not be able to fully compensate for a lack of RSK2
function.

610104	TITLE *610104 MICRO RNA 125B1; MIR125B1
;;miRNA125B1;;
MIRN125B1
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

MicroRNAs, such as MIR125B, are small noncoding RNAs that regulate
target gene expression posttranscriptionally through basepairing with
their target mRNAs. MIR125B1 and MIR125B2 (610105) both encode
precursors of the same mature MIR125B sequence, but the precursors
differ in the sequences flanking the mature MIR125B sequence (Lee et
al., 2005).

CLONING

Using synthetic siRNAs designed against the loop region of both MIR125B1
and MIR125B2, Lee et al. (2005) determined that MIR125B2 was the source
of most of the miR125b they detected in human cell lines.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, Sonkoly et al. (2007) found ubiquitous
but variable expression of miR125B in human tissues. Highest expression
was in prostate, heart, cervix, brain, and bladder.

GENE FUNCTION

Using microarray analysis, Ciafre et al. (2005) found that expression of
MIR125B1 was significantly upregulated in primary glioblastomas compared
with normal peripheral brain tissue.

Using microarray analysis, van Rooij et al. (2006) identified miR125B
among a group of miRNAs upregulated in 2 independent mouse models of
cardiac hypertrophy. Northern blot analysis showed increased expression
of miR125B in idiopathic end-stage failing human hearts.

Laneve et al. (2007) found that MIRN9 (see 611186), MIRN125A (611191),
and MIRN125B were upregulated in a human neuroblastoma cell line by
retinoic acid. They identified the mRNA encoding t-NTRK3, a truncated
isoform of NTRK3 (191316), as a target of the 3 miRNAs. The 3-prime UTR
of the t-NTRK3 transcript has a binding site for MIRN9 and another for
both MIRN125A and MIRN125B, which share the same seed sequence. These
miRNAs repressed t-NTRK3 expression in an additive manner, and
downregulation of t-NTRK3 was critical for regulating neuroblastoma cell
growth. Consistent with their function, MIRN9, MIRN125A, and MIRN125B
were downmodulated in primary neuroblastoma tumors.

Using microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, Sonkoly et al.
(2007) found that expression of miR125B was decreased in psoriasis (see
177900) and atopic eczema (see 603165) compared with normal human skin.

To investigate the functional consequences of heterozygous mutations in
ATM (607585), homozygous mutations in which cause ataxia-telangiectasia
(AT; 208900), Smirnov and Cheung (2008) compared the gene and microRNA
expression phenotypes of noncarriers, AT carriers, and AT patients. The
authors found that some expression phenotypes are more similar between
noncarriers and AT carriers compared to AT patients, as expected for a
recessive disorder. However, for some expression phenotypes, AT carriers
are more similar to the patients than to the noncarriers. Analysis of
one of these expression phenotypes, TNFSF4 (603594) level, allowed
Smirnov and Cheung (2008) to uncover a regulatory pathway in which ATM
regulates TNFSF4 expression through MIRN125B. In AT carriers and AT
patients, this pathway is disrupted. As a result, the level of MIRN125B
is lower and the level of its target gene, TNFSF4, is higher than in
noncarriers. A decreased level of MIRN125B is associated with breast
cancer, and an elevated level of TNFSF4 is associated with
atherosclerosis. Thus, Smirnov and Cheung (2008) concluded that their
findings provided a mechanistic suggestion for the increased risk of
breast cancer and heart disease in AT carriers.

Le et al. (2009) identified highly conserved miRNA response elements in
the 3-prime UTRs of zebrafish and human p53 (TP53; 191170) transcripts
and showed that MIR125B bound directly to these elements. MIR125B
repressed translation of endogenous p53, reduced expression of p53
target genes, and countered drug-induced apoptosis in human cells.
Knockdown of mir125b in zebrafish embryos resulted in severe
developmental defects, particularly accumulation of dead cells in the
brain, and loss of mir125b increased p53 protein and p53-dependent
apoptosis. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with DNA-damaging agents
resulted in downregulation of mir125b and a rapid increase in p53
protein. Le et al. (2009) concluded that MIR125B is an important
negative regulator of p53 and p53-induced apoptosis during development
and during the stress response.

MAPPING

Lee et al. (2005) stated that the MIRN125B1 gene maps to chromosome 11
and is located in the exon of an uncharacterized gene.

Ciafre et al. (2005) stated that the MIR125B1 gene maps to chromosome
11q24.1, where it lies in a cluster with the LET7A2 (612142) and MIR100
(613186) genes.

ANIMAL MODEL

Bousquet et al. (2010) found that inoculation of mice with
Mir125b-overexpressing hematopoietic mouse fetal liver cells resulted in
an elevated number of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes and
macrocytic anemia. Within 12 to 29 weeks posttansplantation, half of the
inoculated mice succumbed to a hematologic malignancy, including
myeloproliferative neoplasm, B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL), and
T-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (T-ALL). The type of leukemia appeared to
be related to the level of Mir125b expression, with lower expression in
T-ALL and higher expression in myeloid neoplasm. Overexpression of
Mir125b also accelerated the development of BCR (151410)/ABL
(189980)-induced leukemia in mice.

601155	TITLE *601155 MINOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY ANTIGEN HA-1; HMHA1
;;HISTOCOMPATIBILITY (MINOR) HA-1;;
HLA-HA1;;
KIAA0223
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against minor histocompatibility
antigens of the host were demonstrated in blood from recipients of bone
marrow from donors who were genotypically HLA identical. Clones of such
cytotoxic T cells were isolated from lymphocyte populations in the blood
of patients with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; see 614395).
These clones were used as reagents to identify 5 nonsex-linked minor
histocompatibility antigens, designated HA-1, -2 (600642) , -3, -4, and
-5 by van Els et al. (1992). Most of the cytotoxic-T-cell clones
isolated from various patients reacted against HA-1 (van Els et al.,
1992). Goulmy et al. (1996) stated that for immune recognition, the
HA-1, -2, -4, and -5 antigens must be presented to cytotoxic T cells by
the major histocompatibility antigen HLA-A2. In this way, they behave
like antigens recognized in an HLA-restricted fashion. The HA-1 antigen
is present in 69% of normal people who express HLA-A2, whereas the
frequencies of the 3 others in this set of HLA-A2-restricted minor
histocompatibility antigens are either high (95% for HA-2); or low (16%
of HA-4 and 7% for HA-5). The HLA-1-restricted minor histocompatibility
antigen HA-3 occurs in 88% of persons positive for HLA-A1. HA-1, -2, -4,
and -5 are inherited independently of the HLA genes; each of them is
encoded by a single gene, and none has a locus within the HLA region
(Schreuder et al., 1993).

GENE FUNCTION

To investigate whether mismatching of minor histocompatibility antigens
contributes to acute GVHD in recipients of genotypically HLA-identical
bone marrow, Goulmy et al. (1996) studied 148 bone marrow recipients and
their sib donors. Fifty pairs were positive for HLA-A1, 117 were
positive for HLA-A2, and 19 were positive for both. The pairs were typed
with cytotoxic-T-cell clones specific for HA-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5. A
mismatch of only HA-1 was significantly correlated with GVHD of grade II
or higher in adults.

Den Haan et al. (1998) identified HA-1 as a nonapeptide derived from a
partial cDNA sequence, designated KIAA0223, derived from the acute
myelogenous leukemia KG-1. HA-1 has the amino acid sequence VLHDDLLEA,
termed HA-1(H). A single amino acid substitution of arginine for
histidine leads to HA-1-negative status, termed HA-1(R). Den Haan et al.
(1998) found that HA-1(H) is presented by its recognizing antigen,
HLA-A*0201, while HA-1(R) is not. The binding affinity of the HA-1(R)
peptide for HLA-A*0201 is 1/12 that of HA-1(H). The authors concluded
that HA-1(R) is a null allele and that only bone marrow transplantation
from an HA-1(R/R) donor to an HA-1(H/H) or HA-1(H/R) recipient, and not
the reverse, would be significantly associated with GVHD. Den Haan et
al. (1998) suggested that HA-1 typing before bone marrow transplantation
of HLA-matched donor-recipient combinations would improve bone marrow
donor selection and prediction of HA-1-induced GVHD.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kaminski et al. (2000) determined that the HA-1 gene contains 23 exons
and spans 16 kb.

MAPPING

By radiation hybrid analysis, Nagase et al. (1996) mapped the KIAA0223
gene to chromosome 19. Kaminski et al. (2000) mapped the HA-1 gene to
chromosome 19p13.3 based on sequence identity shared with a BAC clone
mapped to 19p13.3.

300344	TITLE *300344 MELANOMA ANTIGEN, FAMILY A, 11; MAGEA11
;;MAGE11
DESCRIPTION The MAGEA family consists of 12 genes (MAGEA1 to MAGEA12), of which 6,
MAGEA1 (300016), MAGEA2 (300173), MAGEA3 (300174), MAGEA4 (300175),
MAGEA6 (300176), and MAGEA12 (300177), are expressed in melanomas and
other cancers. For further background information on the MAGEA family,
see 300016.

CLONING

De Plaen et al. (1994) identified the 12 MAGEA genes. MAGEA11 appeared
to be a weakly expressed member of the family.

MAPPING

By analysis of cell hybrids, ordered YACs, and cosmids, Rogner et al.
(1995) localized the MAGEA cluster to Xq28. They showed that the 12
genes are arranged in 3 clusters within 3.5 Mb.

See 300016 for a discussion of the high frequency of genes on the X
chromosome encoding proteins with the MAGE domain as well as other
cancer-testis antigen genes (Ross et al., 2005).

610328	TITLE *610328 RUN AND FYVE DOMAINS-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2; RUFY2
;;KIAA1537
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

By sequencing clones obtained from a size-fractionated fetal brain cDNA
library, Nagase et al. (2000) cloned RUFY2, which they designated
KIAA1537. RT-PCR ELISA detected variable expression in all adult and
fetal tissues examined. Highest expression was in ovary, whole adult
brain, and testis, and lowest expression was in pancreas, spleen, fetal
liver, and fetal whole brain. RUFY2 was expressed in all specific adult
brain regions examined, with highest expression in amygdala.

By searching an EST database for sequences similar to RUFY1 (610327),
followed by screening prostate cancer and neuroblastoma cDNA libraries,
Yang et al. (2002) cloned RUFY2. The deduced 606-amino acid protein has
an N-terminal RUN domain, 2 central coiled-coil domains, and a
C-terminal FYVE domain containing 2 zinc-binding sites and an SH3 domain
recognition motif (PxxPxP). Northern blot analysis detected RUFY2
expression in brain, lung, and testis only.

GENE FUNCTION

By coimmunoprecipitation analysis, Yang et al. (2002) demonstrated that
RUFY2 directly interacted with ETK (EPHA3; 179611) following their
coexpression in a mouse myoblast cell line.

Majercak et al. (2006) showed that expression of RUFY2 reduced secretion
of beta-amyloid from human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing APP
(104760). The RUFY2 gene maps to a region of chromosome 10q that has
been linked to both late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD6; 605526) and
elevated plasma levels of pathogenic beta-amyloid.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the RUFY2
gene to chromosome 10 (TMAP WI-11265). By genomic sequence analysis,
Majercak et al. (2006) mapped the RUFY2 gene to chromosome 10q21.

182100	TITLE +182100 FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE 2; FUT2
;;SECRETOR FACTOR; Se
NORWALK VIRUS INFECTION, RESISTANCE TO, INCLUDED
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The classic human secretor locus (Se) FUT2 encodes
alpha-(1,2)fucosyltransferase, which regulates expression of the Lewis
ABO(H) histo-blood group antigens on the surface of epithelial cells and
in body fluids and determines the secretion status of the ABO antigens
(see 110300). Secretor status of this polymorphic protein was used by
Mohr (1951) to provide the first autosomal linkage in humans between
secretor factor and the Lutheran blood group (see 111200) (summary by
Hazra et al., 2008).

The secretor factor (Se) might be considered either a physiologic trait
or an honorary blood group (VAM). The individual who is a so-called
secretor has demonstrable ABH blood group antigen in the saliva and
other body fluids; the nonsecretor does not. Secretor is dominant.

CLONING

Rouquier et al. (1995) used the FUT1 cDNA to screen chromosome 19 cosmid
libraries in search of the FUT2 gene. One cosmid was isolated that
contained 2 distinct segments that cross-hybridized with FUT1.

Kelly et al. (1995) found that SEC2 encodes a predicted 332-amino acid
polypeptide and a longer isoform that shares 68% sequence identity with
the COOH-terminal 292 residues of human FUT1.

GENE FUNCTION

The secretor locus is linked to the Lutheran blood group locus (111200)
and the myotonic dystrophy locus (DMPK; 605377). Coupled with the
ability to determine the secretor status of the fetus from amniotic
fluid (Harper et al., 1971), this linkage potentially allows prenatal
diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy (DM; 160900). Oriol et al. (1981)
suggested that the Se locus and the Hh (FUT1) locus (211100) may be
closely linked. This is a condition of their model. Classically, the Se
gene is considered to be a regulatory gene controlling expression of the
structural gene H in external secretions. Under this hypothesis, Bombay
(h-h) persons should not be able to express the Se gene. Oriol et al.
(1981) analyzed statistically the 44 published Bombay pedigrees and
concluded that in fact there is no suppression of Se in Bombay persons.
Furthermore, they found a lod score of 12.9 at 1% recombination for
linkage of Bombay and secretor. They suggested that Hh and Se are both
structural genes, each coding for a 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase.

Le Pendu et al. (1982) presented evidence that the fucosyltransferase of
epithelial origin, coded by the Se gene, is able to transform both type
1 and type 2 natural substrate, whereas the enzyme of mesodermal origin,
coded by the H gene (mutant in the Bombay phenotype), works
preferentially on type 2 natural substrate. The close linkage of the 2
genes is of interest. The possible existence of 2 alpha (1-to-2)
fucosyltransferases was first suggested on the basis of stereochemical
differences between the 2 precursor chains, types 1 and 2. Gedde-Dahl et
al. (1984) found linkage of Se and APOE (107741)--peak lod score 3.3 at
recombination fraction 0.08 in males and 1.36 at 0.22 in females, and
linkage of APOE and Lu with lod score 4.52 at zero recombination in
sexes combined. C3-APOE linkage gave lod score 4.0 at theta 0.18 in
males but 0.04 at theta 0.45 in females. A summarizing map was given
(Gedde-Dahl et al., 1984; see their Figure 3).

Kudo et al. (1996) reviewed briefly the biosynthetic pathways involved
in synthesis of Lewis blood group antigens and secretion of ABH into
saliva.

MAPPING

The Lutheran secretor linkage was the first autosomal linkage identified
in man. It was first discovered by Mohr (1951) as a linkage of the
Lutheran blood group and the 'recessive' Lewis blood group. This was
recognized as the Lutheran-secretor linkage (Mohr, 1954) after the
ingenious interpretation by Grubb (1953) of the interactions between the
Lewis (FUT3) locus (111100) determining the presence/absence of Lewis
substance in the saliva and on red cells and the Se locus determining
secretion of ABH blood group substances in the saliva and Le(a) or Le(b)
expression in red cells. Discovery of the secretor-C3 linkage in Mohr's
department (Eiberg et al. (1983)) and the assignment of the C3 locus
(120700) to chromosome 19 indicated that this historic linkage group is
on that chromosome.

Rouquier et al. (1995) observed that a 100-kb cosmid contig, localized
to 19q13.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization, contained FUT1 and 2
FUT1-related sequences, termed SEC1 and SEC2 for secretor candidate 1
and 2. SEC1 and SEC2 were separated by 12 kb and were 65.5 kb and 35 kb
apart, respectively, from the FUT1 gene. They concluded that SEC1 was a
pseudogene with translational frameshifts and termination codons
interrupting potential open reading frames that would otherwise share
primary sequence similarity with FUT1.

Reguigne-Arnould et al. (1995) pointed out that 5 of the 7
fucosyltransferase genes cloned to that time had been mapped to 2
clusters, 1 with FUT1 and FUT2 on 19q and the other with FUT6 (136836),
FUT3, and FUT5 (136835) on 19p. Linkage studies using microsatellite
markers and comparison of genetic and physical maps suggested that FUT1
and FUT2 loci are located on 19q13.3.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

Kelly et al. (1995) found that approximately 20% of randomly selected
individuals were apparently homozygous for an enzyme-inactivating W143X
nonsense mutation (182100.0001) at the FUT2 locus, in correspondence
with the frequency of the nonsecretor phenotype in most human
populations. Furthermore, each of 6 unrelated nonsecretor individuals
were apparently homozygous for this null allele.

Kudo et al. (1996) discussed the possibility of a selective advantage
accounting for the development of different inactivating mutations of
the SEC2 gene in different ethnic groups (see 182100.0002). The absence
or presence of Lewis antigens, proven to be the product of Le and Se
genes, and antigen expression in digestive organs, may be biologically
much more important than expression in erythrocytes.

Koda et al. (1996) reviewed the molecular basis for the
secretor-negative phenotype in Japanese. The nonsense mutation of the
FUT2 gene, 428G-A (182100.0001), found in Caucasians and symbolized se1,
was not found. They found, however, a missense mutation, 385A-T
(182100.0002), designated se2, and 2 nonsense mutations (571C-T, se3,
and 628C-T, se4) in the Japanese Se enzyme-deficient allele. In
addition, Koda et al. (1996) found a fusion gene, which consisted of the
5-prime region of the pseudogene (FUT2P) and the 3-prime region of the
functional FUT2 gene, as an Se enzyme-deficient allele (se5). The DNA
sequence analysis of the fusion gene indicated that the crossover region
corresponded to regions between bases 253 and 313 of the pseudogene and
between bases 211 and 271 of the FUT2 gene. The findings suggested that
the fusion gene was generated by homologous but unequal crossover. A
population study on 141 randomly selected Japanese individuals indicated
to Koda et al. (1996) that se2 is a common Se enzyme-deficient allele in
the Japanese population and that secretor-deficient alleles are race
specific. Liu et al. (1999) investigated 5 populations from 3 ethnic
groups in East Asia for the fusion gene. The fusion gene was found at a
high frequency in 2 Japanese populations (0.0551 in Okinawa and 0.0792
in Akita), and at a very low frequency in a Korean population (0.0063 in
Seoul). No individuals with the fusion gene were identified among 292
patients from 2 Chinese populations. The authors suggested that the
fusion gene likely emerged from within the Japanese population, given
its high frequency in the Japanese but rare occurrence in neighboring
populations.

The common nonsecretor allele found in Caucasians (182100.0001) is
virtually absent in Taiwanese and mainland Chinese. In several groups
indigenous to Taiwan, the Le(a+b-) nonsecretor phenotype has been found,
as reviewed by Yu et al. (1999).

Koda et al. (1997) found that a 725T-G transversion in FUT1
(211100.0004), which results in an amino acid change, leu242 to arg, and
complete deletion of FUT2 (182100.0003) are responsible for the classic
Bombay phenotype.

Lindesmith et al. (2003) found that individuals who are homozygous for
the FUT2 G428A allele (182100.0001) in the ABH histo-blood group family
do not express the H type-1 oligosaccharide ligand required for Norwalk
virus binding. The FUT2 susceptibility allele is fully penetrant against
Norwalk virus infection as none of these individuals developed an
infection after challenge, regardless of dose. Of the susceptible
population that encoded a functional FUT2 gene, a portion was resistant
to infection, suggesting that a memory immune response or some other
unidentified factor also affords protection from Norwalk virus
infection.

Hazra et al. (2008) found a strong association between dbSNP rs492602 in
FUT2 and positive plasma vitamin B12 levels in a genomewide scan and an
independent replication sample from the Nurses' Health Study. Women
homozygous for the dbSNP rs492602 G allele had higher B12 levels. This
allele is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the FUT2 nonsecretor
variant encoding W143X (182100.0001), suggesting a plausible mechanism
for altered B12 absorption and plasma levels. This association was found
in a cohort of healthy women of European descent.

Tanaka et al. (2009) performed a genomewide association analysis to
identify genetic factors affecting circulating vitamin B12 levels and
identified dbSNP rs602662 in the FUT2 gene (p = 2.83 x 10(-20)) in
Italians in the InCHIANTI (1,175 participants), SardiNIA (1,115
participants), and BLSA (640 participants) studies. The top locus was
replicated in an independent sample from the 687 participants in the
Progetto Nutrizione study.

For discussion of a possible association between variation in the FUT2
gene and susceptibility to Crohn disease, see 266600.

ANIMAL MODEL

Falk et al. (1995) created transgenic mice with the human Le gene and
showed that Helicobacter pylori, a causative agent of gastric disorders,
attached to gastric epithelial cells in the transgenic mice but not in
their normal littermates. This implies that Le/Le individuals may have
an advantage in avoiding H. pylori infection (600263).

Using gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, Domino et al. (2001)
generated strains of mice that were deficient in Fut2. Fut2-null mice
developed normally and exhibited no gross phenotypic abnormalities.
Using immunohistochemistry, the authors observed that Fut2-null mice no
longer exhibited the wildtype expression pattern of
alpha(1,2)-fucosylated glycans in the uterine epithelium. However,
normal fertility was observed. Domino et al. (2001) concluded that
alpha(1,2)-fucosylated glycans play nonessential roles in blastocyst
implantation or sperm function in mice.

Kelly et al. (1995) found that a nonsense mutation involving codon 143
(numbered from the putative initiator methionine of the short FUT2
protein) is responsible for the nonsecretor phenotype. See also Rouquier
et al. (1995). The nonsense mutation was due to a G-to-A transition at
nucleotide 428. However, the trp143-to-ter mutation found in ethnic
groups other than Japanese was not found in any of 45 Japanese
nonsecretors. Instead, 2 novel mutations, a C-to-T transition at
nucleotide 357 and an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 385 were found
in Japanese nonsecretors. The 357C-T mutation was silent insofar as
amino acid substitution was concerned; the 385A-T missense mutation
(182100.0002) resulted in inactivation of the
alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase.

Lindesmith et al. (2003) showed that the nonsecretor status in
homozygosity prevents expression of the H type-1 oligosaccharide ligand
and is fully protective from Norwalk virus infection.

Hazra et al. (2008) found that 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the
FUT2 gene, including dbSNP rs601338, which encodes the W143X variant,
are in strong linkage disequilibrium and are strongly associated with
plasma levels of vitamin B12 as a quantitative trait (B12QTL1; 612542).
Hazra et al. (2008) considered the W143X polymorphism to be a plausible
causal variant for this association.

In 1,174 Crohn disease (CD; 266600) cases and 357 controls, McGovern et
al. (2010) found association of the FUT2 W143X polymorphism and CD (p =
2.6 x 10(-5)).

SECRETOR/NONSECRETOR POLYMORPHISM, JAPANESE TYPE
FUT2, ILE129PHE

In the SE gene, designated SEC2 by Rouquier et al. (1995), Kudo et al.
(1996) found homozygosity for an A-to-T transversion at nucleotide 385,
resulting in a missense substitution ile129-to-phe in all Japanese
nonsecretor individuals. They referred to the mutant allele in Japanese
nonsecretors as sej; sej/sej homozygosity accounted for more than 15% of
the Japanese population. The inactivated sej allele had a frequency of
39% in the Japanese. Kudo et al. (1996) discussed the possibility of a
selective advantage accounting for the development of different
inactivating mutations of the SEC2 gene in different ethnic groups.

BOMBAY PHENOTYPE, CLASSIC
FUT2, DEL

In 3 unrelated individuals with the Bombay phenotype, Koda et al. (1997)
found that a 725T-G transversion in FUT1 (211100.0004), which results in
an amino acid change, leu242 to arg, and complete deletion of FUT2 were
responsible for the classic Bombay phenotype. The individuals lacked the
H antigen not only on blood cells but also in saliva, which prompted
Koda et al. (1997) to investigate the FUT2 gene in these persons. The
mutations in both genes were homozygous. The results of analyses of FUT1
and FUT2 by Koda et al. (1997) suggested that the homozygosity for these
2 unusual and linked genetic mutations is common in individuals with the
classic Bombay phenotype.

Koda et al. (2000) isolated the junction region of the deletion of FUT2
and found evidence that the deletion was generated by Alu-Alu
recombination.

603234	TITLE *603234 ATP-BINDING CASSETTE, SUBFAMILY C, MEMBER 6; ABCC6
;;ANTHRACYCLINE RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; ARA;;
MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 6; MRP6
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

ABCC6 belongs to the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)
subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transmembrane transporters. MRPs
are involved in drug resistance, particularly in association with cancer
chemotherapy. Mutations in the ABCC6 gene cause pseudoxanthoma elasticum
(PXE; see 264800), a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized
by calcification of elastic fibers in skin, arteries, and retina (Bergen
et al., 2000; Le Saux et al., 2000; Ringpfeil et al., 2000).

CLONING

Multidrug resistance in cancer cells has been attributed to the
overexpression of certain membrane proteins, several of which are
members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Examples include
MRP (158343) and MDR1 (171050). Longhurst et al. (1996) screened an
E1000 leukemia cell cDNA library using an MRP probe. They cloned a novel
cDNA encoding a 453-amino acid polypeptide that was similar to the
C-terminal half of MRP. Whereas MRP contains 2 ABC domains and 12
transmembrane domains, the ARA protein contains 1 ABC domain and 5
transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis showed that ARA was
expressed as a 2.2-kb mRNA in an E1000 leukemia cell line, but not in
the untransformed parental CEM cell line. Southern blot analysis
revealed that, like MRP, the ARA gene was amplified in the genomic DNA
of the E1000 cell line. The ABCC6 protein consists of 1,503 amino acids
with a molecular mass of 165 kD, is located in the plasma membrane, and
probably has 17 membrane-spanning helices grouped into 3 transmembrane
domains (Le Saux et al., 2000). The 4.5-kb ABCC6 mRNA is expressed in
several secretory tissues, but primarily in kidney and liver. By RT-PCR
analysis using RNA isolated from tissues frequently affected by PXE,
Bergen et al. (2000) detected expression of ABCC6 in retina, skin, and
vascular tissue, although the highest level of expression was in the
liver.

By Western blot analysis of transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
cells, Belinsky et al. (2002) found that MRP6 migrated at the predicted
molecular mass of about 152 kD and at 182 kD, which likely represents a
glycosylated form.

Sinko et al. (2003) found that human ABCC6, when expressed by retroviral
transduction in polarized mammalian cells (MDCKII), is exclusively
localized to the basolateral membrane. In contrast to the in vitro
translated protein, ABCC6 was glycosylated in MDCK cells. Limited
proteolysis of the fully glycosylated and underglycosylated forms,
followed by immunodetection with region-specific antibodies, indicated
that asn15, located in the extracellular N-terminal region of ABCC6, is
the only N-glycosylated site in the protein.

By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis, Beck et al.
(2005) detected ABCC6 mRNA and protein in a wide range of epithelial
cells of exocrine and endocrine tissues such as acinar cells in the
pancreas, mucosal cells of the intestine, and follicular epithelial
cells of the thyroid. Enteroendocrine G cells of the stomach showed
strong immunostaining. In addition, ABCC6 mRNA and protein were present
in most neurons of the brain, in alveolar macrophages in the lung, in
lymph node lymphocytes, in hepatocytes, and in keratinocytes and
epithelial cells of the ducts of sweat glands.

Using PCR, Matsuzaki et al. (2005) found that Abcc6 expression was
highest in mouse liver and lower in kidney and small intestine.
Second-round nested PCR revealed much weaker expression in brain,
tongue, stomach, and eye. Subcloning and sequencing of distinct PCR
products indicated that the 3-prime end is subject to aberrant splicing,
resulting in each case in a premature termination codon. PCR analysis of
cultured human cells revealed similar splice variations in the 3-prime
end resulting in the skipping of exons 24 and 30 in epidermal
keratinocytes, and exons 24, 26, and 28 in dermal fibroblasts. In
fibroblasts, a minor PCR product represented alternative splicing of
exon 7.

GENE STRUCTURE

Kool et al. (1999) determined that the human ABCC6 gene comprises 31
exons.

Ratajewski et al. (2008) found that the 5-prime upstream region of the
ABCC6 gene contains a major Alu element of over 4.5 kb.

GENE FUNCTION

Belinsky and Kruh (1999) and Klein et al. (1999) suggested that ABCC6
function may be related to cellular detoxification rather than drug
resistance. Bergen et al. (2000) commented that the molecules presumably
transported by ABCC6 may be essential for extracellular matrix
deposition or turnover of connective tissue at specific sites in the
body. Given the high expression of ABCC6 in liver and kidney, ABCC6
substrates may be transported into the blood. A deficiency of specific
ABCC6 substrates may affect a range of connective tissue sites
throughout the body and specifically elastic fiber assembly.

By assaying membrane vesicles obtained from ABCC6-expressing insect
cells, Ilias et al. (2002) found ABCC6 specifically bound MgATP and
actively transported glutathione conjugates, including leukotriene-C4
and N-ethylmaleimide S-glutathione (NEM-GS), in an MgATP-dependent
manner. 17-Beta-estradiol-17-beta-D-glucuronide was a weak transport
substrate. The organic anions probenecid, benzbromarone, and
indomethacin specifically inhibited ABCC6-mediated NEM-GS transport, and
orthovanadate, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, completely
inhibited NEM-GS transport.

Using similar substrates, Belinsky et al. (2002) found that MRP6
expressed in CHO cell membranes could transport glutathione conjugates
but not glucuronate conjugates. Transfected cells also showed enhanced
resistance to several anticancer agents. The highest levels of
resistance were observed for the inhibitors of topoisomerase II (126430)
etoposide and teniposide, followed by the anthracyclines doxorubicin and
daunorubicin. MRP6-expressing CHO cells accumulated less etoposide
compared with control transfected cells, indicating that MRP6 functions
as a drug efflux pump.

Using a luciferase reporter gene construct, Jiang et al. (2006) examined
the 2.6-kb human ABCC6 promoter. An NF-kappa-B (see NFKB1, 164011)-like
sequence conferred strong expression in HepG2 hepatoma cells, but much
weaker expression in cell lines of other tissue origin. Injection of the
construct into mouse tail vein confirmed liver-specific expression.
Testing of selected cytokines revealed that TGF-beta (190180)
upregulated, while TNF-alpha (191160) and interferon-gamma (IFNG;
147570) downregulated, the promoter activity in HepG2 cells. The
responsiveness to TGF-beta resided primarily within an SP1 (189906)/SP3
(601804) binding site. The expression of the ABCC6 promoter was markedly
enhanced by SP1. Jiang et al. (2006) concluded that the expression of
ABCC6 can be modulated by proinflammatory cytokines.

Using the ABCC6 promoter region in reporter gene assays in the HepG2
hepatoma cell line, Ratajewski et al. (2006) showed that all-trans
retinoic acid caused significant induction of ABCC6 activity. They found
9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA), a specific RXR (see RXRA, 180245) receptor
agonist, induced the ABCC6 promoter in a concentration-dependent manner.
9cRA also induced the expression of endogenous ABCC6 in HepG2 cells. The
binding of RXR to the endogenous ABCC6 promoter was confirmed by
chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Occupancy of the ABCC6
promoter by RXR was relatively high in unstimulated cells and increased
further in 9cRA-treated cells.

Using the ABCC6 reporter construct described by Ratajewski et al. (2006)
in a screen for ABCC6-regulating factors, Ratajewski et al. (2008) found
that GATA3 (131320) repressed ABCC6 activity, and that SP1, PLAG1
(603026), and PLAGL1 (603044) induced ABCC6 activity. They identified 2
putative PLAG-binding sites on the reverse strand of the ABCC6 proximal
promoter. Reporter gene assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays,
and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the more proximal
site was bound and activated by PLAG1 and PLAGL1. Furthermore,
overexpression of PLAG1 resulted in enhanced ABCC6 transcription in
transfected human embryonic kidney cells.

MAPPING

Kuss et al. (1998) used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the
ARA gene to human chromosome 16p13.1. The gene order in this region is
telomere--MYH11(160745)--MRP--ARA--centromere. The MRP and ARA genes are
located within 9 kb of each other and are transcribed in opposite
directions. Both MRP and ARA are deleted in a subgroup of inv(16)
leukemias, and both are expressed in normal hematopoietic precursor
cells.

- Pseudogenes

Pulkkinen et al. (2001) identified 2 pseudogenes containing sequences
highly homologous to the 5-prime end of the ABCC6 gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum

Simultaneously and independently, Bergen et al. (2000), Le Saux et al.
(2000), and Ringpfeil et al. (2000) identified missense, nonsense, and
splice site mutations as well as deletions and insertions in the ABCC6
gene accounting for pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800). Mutations
appeared to represent autosomal recessive (Le Saux et al., 2000) and
autosomal dominant (177850) (Bergen et al., 2000) modes of inheritance,
and sporadic cases. By SSCP and heteroduplex analysis using genetic DNA
from a cohort of 17 unrelated PXE patients, Le Saux et al. (2000)
screened 109 exons within 5 PXE candidate genes in the chromosome
16p13.1 region for mutations. By screening the 31 exons of ABCC6 by
SSCP, Le Saux et al. (2000) identified 6 mutations that were responsible
for PXE in 10 of 17 patients. They identified a C-to-T substitution
within exon 24 at nucleotide 3421, resulting in an arg-to-stop
substitution at codon 1141 (R1141X; 603234.0001) in 6 unrelated families
with autosomal recessive PXE. Bergen et al. (2000) identified mutations
in ABCC6 causing autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and sporadic
PXE. Bergen et al. (2000) found the R114X mutation in 2 families with
autosomal dominant PXE. One patient had a large de novo deletion of
chromosome 16 (603234.0010). Ringpfeil et al. (2000) reported a total of
8 pathogenetic mutations in the ABCC6 gene in 8 kindreds with PXE. They
referred to the gene as MRP6 (multidrug resistance-associated
protein-6). Examination of clinically unaffected family members in 4
multiplex families identified heterozygous carriers, consistent with an
autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.

Le Saux et al. (2001) performed a mutation analysis of the ABCC6 gene in
122 unrelated patients with PXE, the largest cohort of patients studied
to that time. They characterized 36 mutations, 28 of which were novel.
Twenty-one were missense variants, 6 were small insertions or deletions,
5 were nonsense, 2 were alleles likely to result in aberrant mRNA
splicing, and 2 were large deletions involving ABCC6. Although most
mutations appeared to be unique variants, 2 disease-causing alleles
occurred frequently in apparently unrelated individuals. Arg1141 to ter
(R1141X; 603234.0001) was found in this patient cohort at a frequency of
18.8% and was preponderant in European patients. Deletion of nucleotides
23-29 (603234.0016) occurred at a frequency of 12.9% and was prevalent
in patients from the United States. Putative disease-causing mutations
were identified in approximately 64% of the 244 chromosomes studied, and
85.2% of the 122 patients were found to have at least 1 disease-causing
allele. The results suggested that a fraction of the undetected mutant
alleles could be either genomic rearrangements or mutations occurring in
noncoding regions of the ABCC6 gene. A cluster of disease-causing
variants was observed within exons encoding a large C-terminal
cytoplasmic loop and in the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain.

While implementing a strategy to screen for PXE by complete mutation
analysis of the ABCC6 gene, Germain (2001) found evidence for the
existence of at least 1 pseudogene highly homologous to the 5-prime end
of ABCC6. Sequence variants in this ABCC6-like pseudogene could be
mistaken for mutations in the ABCC6 gene and consequently lead to
erroneous genotyping results in pedigrees affected with PXE.

Germain et al. (2001) identified a heterozygous missense mutation in
exon 7 of the ABCC6 gene in a female PXE patient whose parents were
second cousins. Despite complete scanning of the gene, no further
mutation was evident. A heterozygous profile was also found in the
proband's unaffected children. However, haplotype homozygosity was
confirmed at chromosome 16p13.1, using both extragenic microsatellites
and intragenic polymorphisms located 3-prime from the mutation, in
agreement with the known consanguinity in the family. Taken together,
the data indicated that PCR products of exon 7 of the ABCC6 gene were
amplified from more than 2 genomic copies. This supported the existence
of one or more ABCC6 pseudogenes highly homologous to the 5-prime end
(exons 1-9) of the ABCC6 gene.

Pulkkinen et al. (2001) identified 2 pseudogenes containing sequences
highly homologous to the 5-prime end of the ABCC6 gene. Nucleotide
differences in flanking introns between these 2 pseudogenes and ABCC6
allowed them to design allele-specific primers that eliminated the
amplification of both pseudogene sequences by PCR and provided reliable
amplification of ABCC6-specific sequences only. The use of
allele-specific PCR revealed 2 novel 5-prime-end PXE mutations.

In 59 unrelated Dutch patients with PXE, Hu et al. (2003) identified 17
different mutations, including 11 novel mutations, in the ABCC6 gene in
65 alleles. The R1141X mutation was by far the most common mutation,
identified in 19 (32.2%) patients; the second most common mutation,
which results in the deletion of exons 23-29 (603234.0014), was
identified in 11 (18.6%) patients. In 20 patients, only 1 mutation in 1
allele was detected. Combined with previous mutation data, Hu et al.
(2003) concluded that approximately 80% of the PXE mutations occur in
the cytoplasmic domains of the predicted ABCC6 protein, especially the 2
nucleotide-binding fold (NBF) domains (NBF1 and NBF2) and the eighth
cytoplasmic loop between the fifteenth and sixteenth transmembrane
regions.

Hu et al. (2004) described an efficient molecular diagnostic strategy
for ABCC6 in PXE. The 2 most frequent mutations, R1141X (603234.0001)
and deletion of exons 23 through 29 (603234.0016), as well as a core set
of mutations, were identified by restriction enzyme digestion and size
separation on agarose gels. In the remaining patient group in which only
1 or no mutant allele was found, the complete coding sequence was
analyzed using DHPLC. All variations found were confirmed by direct DNA
sequencing. Finally, Southern blot was used to investigate the potential
presence of small or large deletions. Twenty different mutations,
including 2 novel mutations in the ABCC6 gene, were identified in 80.3%
of the 76 patients, and 58.6% of the 152 ABCC6 alleles analyzed.

Chassaing et al. (2005) commented that mutations had been identified in
PXE in most of the 31 ABCC6 exons and that no correlation between the
nature or the location of the mutations and phenotype severity had been
established.

Trip et al. (2002), Van Soest et al. (1997), and Bacchelli et al. (1999)
emphasized the carriage of a sole ABCC6 mutation as a cardiovascular
risk factor. Sherer et al. (2001) described limited phenotypic
expression of PXE in parents of affected offspring.

Miksch et al. (2005) performed a mutation screen in ABCC6 using
haplotype analysis in conjunction with direct sequencing to achieve a
mutation detection rate of 97%. Their mutational analysis confirmed an
earlier haplotype-based analysis and conclusions regarding a
recessive-only mode of inheritance in PXE (Cai et al., 2000) through the
identification of 2 mutated alleles in all individuals with PXE who
appear in either consecutive or alternating generations of the same
family. Their study demonstrated that the full phenotypic expression of
the disorder requires 2 defective allelic copies of ABCC6 and that
pseudodominance is the mode of transmission in presumed autosomal
dominant families (i.e., the second parental disease allele 'marries
into' the family). The apparent frequency of this mechanism was
approximately 7.5% in their family cohort. Miksch et al. (2005) stated
that in their families no heterozygote for a large deletion showed any
apparent clinical sign of PXE according to category I diagnostic
criteria.

Chassaing et al. (2005) provided a comprehensive catalog of ABCC6
mutations identified in PXE.

Pfendner et al. (2007) collected mutation data on an international case
series of 270 patients with PXE (239 probands, 31 affected family
members). In 134 patients with a known phenotype and both mutations
identified, genotype-phenotype correlations were assessed. In total, 316
mutant alleles in ABCC6, including 39 novel mutations, were identified
in 239 probands. Mutations clustered in exons 24 and 28, corresponding
to the second nucleotide-binding fold and the last intracellular domain
of the protein. Together with the recurrent R1141X (603234.0001) and
del23-29 (603234.0016) mutations, these mutations accounted for 71.5% of
the total individual mutations identified. Genotype-phenotype analysis
failed to reveal a significant correlation between the type of mutations
identified or their predicted effect on the expression of the protein
and the age of onset and severity of the disease.

Using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to analyze
35 PXE patients with incomplete ABCC6 genotypes after exonic sequencing,
Costrop et al. (2010) identified 6 multiexon deletions and 4 single-exon
deletions and were thus able to characterized 25% of the unidentified
disease alleles. The findings illustrated the instability of the ABCC6
genomic region and stressed the importance of screening for deletions in
the molecular diagnosis of PXE.

- Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy 2

In a 28-year-old French man with PXE, who had a younger brother who died
of generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI1; 614473) at age
15 months, Le Boulanger et al. (2010) identified compound heterozygosity
for missense mutations in the ABCC6 gene (603234.0025 and 603234.0026),
which were also found in heterozygosity in each of his unaffected
parents, respectively. No disease-causing mutations were found in the
known GACI1 (208000)-related gene, ENPP1 (173335). Although no DNA
material was available from the deceased younger brother, his disease
was presumed to be related to the familial ABCC6 mutations. Le Boulanger
et al. (2010) concluded that GACI may represent an atypical and severe
end of the vascular phenotypic spectrum of PXE.

Nitschke et al. (2012) analyzed the ABCC6 gene in 28 GACI patients from
25 unrelated families who were negative for mutation in the ENNP1 gene,
as well as 2 unrelated GACI patients in whom only 1 ENNP1 mutation had
been detected. They identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity
for mutations in ABCC6 in 8 unrelated GACI patients (see, e.g.,
603234.0001, 603234.0006, and 603234.0027-603234.0029). In 6 patients
from 5 unrelated families, only 1 mutation was detected in ABCC6; the
authors noted that there was no phenotypic difference between these
patients and those with biallelic mutations in ABCC6, and stated that
mutations in regulatory untranslated regions of ABCC6 might not have
been detected by their approach. No mutation in the ABCC6 gene was found
in 16 patients from 14 unrelated families, including the 2 patients who
were known to carry monoallelic mutations in ENNP1. Overall, 13
different ABCC6 mutations were identified in GACI patients, all but 2 of
which had been previously identified in typical PXE patients who had a
much milder phenotype than the GACI patients. Based on the considerable
overlap of phenotype and genotype of GACI and pseudoxanthoma elasticum,
Nitschke et al. (2012) suggested that GACI and PXE represent 2 ends of a
clinical spectrum of ectopic calcification and other organ pathologies
rather than 2 distinct disorders.

POPULATION GENETICS

The Afrikaner population of South Africa is of Dutch, German, and French
Huguenot descent and has its origin in the first European immigrant
settlements at the Cape of Good Hope during the 17th century. Torrington
and Viljoen (1991) proposed that the basis for the high prevalence of
PXE in the Afrikaner population is a founder effect. An initial
genealogic study traced the ancestry of 20 Afrikaner families with PXE
back to potentially only 4 individuals, suggesting that this disorder is
most likely derived from these original founders in South Africa. To
further study this possibility, Le Saux et al. (2002) performed
haplotype and mutation analyses in 17 of the 20 originally analyzed
Afrikaner families, and identified 3 common haplotypes and 6 different
disease-causing variants. Three of these mutant alleles were missense
variants, 2 were nonsense mutations, and 1 was a single-basepair
insertion. The most common variant, arg1339 to cys (R1339C;
603234.0017), accounted for 53% of the PXE alleles, whereas other mutant
alleles appeared at lower frequencies ranging from 3 to 12%. Haplotype
analysis of the Afrikaner families showed that the 3 most frequent
mutations were identical by descent, indicating a founder origin of PXE
in this population.

Chassaing et al. (2005) suggested that the proposed prevalence of PXE of
1 in 25,000 may be an underestimation. Consequently, the prevalence of
heterozygous carriers, and the prevalence of different organ involvement
in carriers of 1 or 2 ABCC6 mutations, are not precisely known.

PATHOGENESIS

Since the ABCC6 gene is expressed primarily, if not exclusively, in the
liver and kidneys, Ringpfeil et al. (2001) suggested that PXE is a
primary metabolic disorder with secondary involvement of elastic fibers,
a situation comparable to the secondary involvement of connective tissue
elements in homocystinuria (236200) and alkaptonuria (203500).

ABCC6 is a member of the large ATP-dependent transmembrane transporter
family. Chassaing et al. (2005) commented that the association of PXE to
ABCC6 efflux transport alterations raised a number of pathophysiology
hypotheses, among them, the idea that PXE is a systemic metabolic
disease resulting from lack or accumulation over time in the bloodstream
of molecules interacting with the synthesis, turnover, and/or
maintenance of extracellular matrix (ECM).

Since ABCC6 is expressed primarily in the liver, Jiang and Uitto (2006)
likewise supported the notion that PXE is a metabolic disease.

In an investigation of the functional relationship between ABCC6
deficiency and elastic fiber calcification, Le Saux et al. (2006)
speculated that ABCC6 deficiency in PXE patients induces a persistent
imbalance in circulating metabolite(s) which impairs the synthetic
abilities of normal elastoblasts or specifically alters elastic fiber
assembly. They found that PXE fibroblasts cultured with normal human
serum expressed and deposited increased amounts of proteins, but
structurally normal elastic fibers. Normal and PXE fibroblasts as well
as normal smooth muscle cells deposited abnormal aggregates of elastic
fibers when maintained in the presence of serum from PXE patients. The
expression of tropoelastin (see 130160) and other elastic
fiber-associated genes was not significantly modulated by the presence
of PXE serum. These results indicated that certain metabolites present
in PXE sera interfered with the normal assembly of elastic fibers in
vitro and suggested that PXE is a primary metabolic disorder with
secondary connective tissue manifestations.

ANIMAL MODEL

To elucidate the pathogenesis of PXE, Klement et al. (2005) generated a
transgenic mouse by targeted ablation of the mouse Abcc6 gene.
Abcc6-null mice were negative for expression of Mrp6 in the liver, and
necropsies revealed profound mineralization of several tissues including
skin, arterial blood vessels, and retina, while heterozygous animals
were indistinguishable from the wildtype mice. Particularly striking was
the mineralization of vibrissae, as confirmed by von Kossa and alizarin
red stains. Electron microscopy revealed mineralization affecting both
elastic structures and collagen fibers. Mineralization of vibrissae was
noted as early as 5 weeks of age and was progressive with age in Abcc6
-/- mice but was not observed in heterozygous or wildtype mice up to 2
years of age. Total body computerized tomography scan of Abcc6 -/- mice
showed mineralization in skin and subcutaneous tissue as well as in
kidneys. These data demonstrated aberrant mineralization of soft tissues
in PXE-affected organs, and consequently, these mice recapitulated
features of this complex disease.

Gorgels et al. (2005) generated Abcc6 -/- mice and showed by light and
electron microscopy that Abcc6 -/- mice spontaneously developed
calcification of elastic fibers in blood vessel walls and in Bruch
membrane in the eye. No clear abnormalities were seen in the dermal
extracellular matrix. Calcification of blood vessels was most prominent
in small arteries in the cortex of the kidney, but in old mice, it
occurred also in other organs and in the aorta and vena cava. Monoclonal
antibodies against mouse Abcc6 localized the protein to the basolateral
membranes of hepatocytes and the basal membrane in renal proximal
tubules, but failed to show the protein at the pathogenic sites. Abcc6
-/- mice developed a 25% reduction in plasma HDL cholesterol and an
increase in plasma creatinine levels, which may be due to impaired
kidney function. No changes in serum mineral balance were found. Gorgels
et al. (2005) concluded that the phenotype of the Abcc6 -/- mouse shares
calcification of elastic fibers with human PXE pathology, and supports
the hypothesis that PXE is a systemic disease.

To characterize the mineralization process in PXE, Jiang et al. (2007)
examined a PXE animal model, the Abcc6 -/- mouse, with respect to
specific proteins serving as inhibitors of mineralization. The levels of
calcium and phosphate in serum of these mice were normal, but the Abcc6
-/- serum had less ability to prevent the mineral deposition induced by
inorganic phosphate in a cell culture system. Addition of fetuin-A
(138680) to the culture system prevented the mineralization. The
calcium-phosphate product was markedly elevated in the mineralized
vibrissae of Abcc6 -/- mice, an early biomarker of the mineralization
process, consistent with histopathologic findings. Levels of fetuin-A
were slightly decreased in Abcc6 -/- serum, and positive immunostaining
for matrix-Gla-protein (MGP; 154870), fetuin-A, and ankylosis protein
(ANK; 605145) as well as alkaline phosphatase activity were strongly
associated with the mineralization process. In situ hybridization
demonstrated that the genes for MGP and Ank were expressed locally in
vibrissae, whereas fetuin-A was expressed highly in the liver. These
data suggested that the deposition of the bone-associated proteins
spatially coincides with mineralization and actively regulates this
process locally and systemically.

In the Dyscalc1 mouse model of dystrophic cardiac calcification (DCC),
Meng et al. (2007) studied 2 intercrosses and identified Abcc6 as the
causative gene, which was confirmed by transgenic complementation. The
authors noted that myocardial calcification has not been reported as a
phenotype associated with human PXE or mouse Abcc6-knockout models.

In all mouse strains positive for DCC, Aherrahrou et al. (2008)
identified a missense mutation at the 3-prime border of exon 14 of the
Abcc6 gene that created an additional donor splice site. The alternative
transcript lacked the last 5 nucleotides of exon 14, resulting in
premature termination at codon 684, and leading to Abcc6 protein
deficiency in DCC-susceptible mice.

Jiang et al. (2009) found that grafting of wildtype mouse muzzle skin
onto the back of Abcc6-knockout mice resulted in abnormal mineralization
of vibrissae consistent with PXE, whereas grafting of Abcc6-knockout
mouse muzzle skin onto wildtype mice did not. The data implied that PXE
does not result from localized defect based on resident cellular
abnormalities but from a change of metabolite(s) in serum. These
findings implicate circulatory factors as a critical component of the
mineralization process and supported the notion that PXE is a secondary
mineralization of connective tissues. In addition, the findings
suggested that the abnormal mineralization process could possibly be
countered or even reversed by changes in the homeostatic milieu.

PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ARTERIAL CALCIFICATION, GENERALIZED, OF INFANCY, 2, INCLUDED
ABCC6, ARG1141TER

---Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum

In a large consanguineous Italian family segregating autosomal recessive
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800), Le Saux et al. (2000) identified a
C-to-T transition at nucleotide 3421 in exon 24 of the ABCC6 gene,
resulting in an arg-to-ter substitution at codon 1141 (R1141X). All
unaffected individuals but 1 were heterozygous carriers; affected
individuals were homozygous for this mutation. This variant was not
found in the control panel of 200 normal alleles and cosegregated in
homozygous or compound heterozygous state with the PXE phenotype in
families. This mutation was also identified in 5 unrelated pedigrees.
R1141X was found in homozygous state in unrelated patients with
autosomal recessive PXE from the United Kingdom and Belgium. Haplotype
analysis of the PXE locus in families with the R1141X mutation revealed
that this mutation was segregating with different haplotypes, suggesting
that R1141X may be a recurrent mutation in ABCC6. Testing of cultured
skin fibroblasts showed no ABCC6 mRNA in patients carrying the R1141X
mutation from the large Italian pedigree.

Bergen et al. (2000) identified this mutation in 2 families segregating
autosomal dominant PXE (177850).

In a family in which 2 brothers and a sister had PXE, Ringpfeil et al.
(2000) demonstrated that the affected individuals were compound
heterozygotes for the R1141X mutation and an R1268Q mutation
(603234.0011).

In a cohort of 101 unrelated patients with PXE, Le Saux et al. (2001)
found that the R1141X mutant allele was present in 28.4% of European
alleles and only 4.1% of U.S. alleles. Also, this nonsense mutation was
unequally distributed among European countries. The frequency of
homozygotes was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the European
population.

Hu et al. (2003) demonstrated a founder effect for the R1141X mutation
in the Netherlands. They identified the mutation in 19 alleles in 16
Dutch patients with PXE, in heterozygous, homozygous, or compound
heterozygous form. Expression of the normal allele in heterozygotes was
predominant; no or very low expression was found in homozygotes. The
mutation induced instability of the aberrant mRNA. Hu et al. (2003)
suggested that the PXE phenotype of the R1141X mutation most likely
results from complete loss of function or functional haploinsufficiency
of ABCC6.

In the study of Trip et al. (2002), the presence of a single R1141X
mutation in ABCC6 appeared to be an independent risk factor for coronary
heart disease in young people.

---Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy 2

In 2 patients with generalized arterial calcification of infancy-2
(GACI2; 614473), Nitschke et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the ABCC6 gene. A French female infant
with GACI who died at 6 weeks of age, who had calcification of the
coronary arteries and other arteries, severe hypertension, and heart
failure, was compound heterozygous for R1141X and R1314W (603234.0006).
A 3-year-old Spanish boy with GACI who had calcification of the splenic
and pancreatic arteries, nephrocalcinosis, severe hypertension,
cardiomegaly, psychomotor retardation, and abdominal distention, was
compound heterozygous for R1141X and R518X (603234.0027).

---Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum, Forme Fruste, Digenic, ABCC6/GGCX

In a woman and her sister with biopsy-confirmed PXE, Li et al. (2009)
identified compound heterozygosity for the R1141X mutation and a
mutation in the GGCX gene (V255M; 137167.0012). Neither had evidence of
a coagulopathy and the skin phenotype was mild (see 177850), but skin
biopsies showed undercarboxylated matrix gla proteins (MGP; 154870) in
the areas of abnormal mineralization. Since R1141X in the heterozygous
state is usually not associated with clinical features, the findings
suggested that the women had digenic inheritance of PXE. In contrast, 2
other family members who were compound heterozygous for R1141X and
another mutation in the GGCX gene (S300F; 137167.0013) had no signs of
either disorder on clinical exam but refused further clinical testing.
Plasma levels of undercarboxylated total MGP of the 2 clinically
unaffected individuals were at the lower end of normal. Although the
reasons for the lack of clinical findings in the 2 unaffected family
members remained unclear, Li et al. (2009) concluded that
undercarboxylation of MGP plays a critical role in aberrant
mineralization of tissues in PXE.

.0002
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, IVS21, G-T, +1

In patients with autosomal recessive pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800)
from 2 families, Le Saux et al. (2000) found that affected individuals
carried a G-to-T transversion at the +1 position of intron 21 of the
ABCC6 gene, affecting the donor splice site. One of the families was
from the U.K., and the other was from the United States. The family from
the U.K. carried the R1141X mutation (603234.0001) on the other allele;
in the American family, the other mutation was R1138Q (603234.0003).

.0003
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1138GLN

In a family with autosomal recessive pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800),
Le Saux et al. (2000) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 3413
of the ABCC6 gene, resulting in an arginine-to-glutamine substitution at
codon 1138 (R1138Q). This mutation was found in compound heterozygosity
with the IVS21+1G-T mutation (603234.0002).

In a so-called sporadic case of PXE, Ringpfeil et al. (2000) identified
an R1138Q mutation in the ABCC6 gene in compound heterozygosity with the
R1268 mutation (603234.0011). Arginine-1138 is the same codon as that
affected in the R1138W mutation (603234.0012); in the latter mutation,
the nucleotide change is 3412C-T.

.0004
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1114PRO

In a family with autosomal recessive pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800),
Le Saux et al. (2000) found affected individuals to be homozygous for a
G-to-C transversion at nucleotide 3341 of the ABCC6 gene, resulting in
an arg-to-pro substitution at codon 1114 (R1114P) in exon 24. This
mutation was found in homozygosity.

.0005
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, 1-BP DEL, 3775T

In a patient thought to represent an isolated case of autosomal dominant
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (177850), Le Saux et al. (2000) found a
deletion of a T at nucleotide 3775 of the ABCC6 gene. This was a de novo
mutation in the patient, and no mutations were found in the other allele
of ABCC6 by screening using SSCP.

Plomp et al. (2009) examined a group of 15 adults homozygous for the
3775delT mutation and 44 individuals heterozygous for this mutation from
a genetically isolated population in the Netherlands. All participants
filled out a questionnaire and underwent standardized dermatologic and
ophthalmologic examinations with photography of skin and fundus
abnormalities. Skin biopsies from affected skin or a predilection site
and/or a scar were examined and compared with biopsies from controls.
Plomp et al. (2009) found that skin abnormalities, ophthalmologic signs,
and cardiovascular problems varied greatly among the 15 homozygous
participants. There was no correlation among severity of skin, eyes, or
cardiovascular abnormalities. None of the 44 heterozygous participants
had any sign of pseudoxanthoma elasticum on dermatologic,
histopathologic, and/or ophthalmologic examination, but 32% had
cardiovascular disease.

.0006
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ARTERIAL CALCIFICATION, GENERALIZED, OF INFANCY, 2, INCLUDED
ABCC6, ARG1314TRP

Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum

In a patient with autosomal recessive pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800),
Le Saux et al. (2000) identified a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 3940
of the ABCC6 gene, resulting in an arg-to-trp substitution at codon 1314
(R1314W). This mutation was found in homozygosity in one family.

Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy 2

In a 5-year-old boy with generalized arterial calcification of infancy
(GACI2; 614473), Nitschke et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for the
R1314W mutation. The boy was born as the first of dizygotic twins, and
his twin brother was unaffected. The patient had calcification of the
aorta and pulmonary, coronary, and renal arteries as well as other
arteries, and stippled calcifications of proximal epiphyses of humeri,
femora, pelvic cartilage, larynx, and mandible. He had severely
decreased biventricular systolic function, marked cardiomegaly, and
severe mitral insufficiency, as well as hypertension and respiratory
insufficiency. Cerebral MRI revealed diffuse white matter disease, with
cystic encephalomalacia, and laboratory analysis showed
hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Nitschke et al. (2012)
also identified the R1314W mutation in compound heterozygosity in 2
unrelated GACI patients, a French female infant who died at 6 weeks of
age and also carried an R1141X mutation (603234.0001), and an
Afro-Caribbean male infant who died at 8 weeks of age with generalized
arterial stenosis, myocardial infarction, and hypertension and also
carried a 1-bp insertion (450insC; 603234.0028) in exon 4 of the ABCC6
gene, predicted to result in a premature stop codon and a truncated
protein. In addition, in a 3-year-old South African girl with GACI,
Nitschke et al. (2012) identified only a heterozygous R1314W mutation,
but noted that mutations in regulatory untranslated regions of ABCC6
might not have been detected by their technique. In the South African
child, onset of symptoms occurred at 2.5 years of age, and included
calcification of the aorta, spleen, and pancreas, nephrocalcinosis,
failure to thrive, hypertension, and heart failure.

PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, 1-BP DEL, 3798T

In a large autosomal recessive pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800) family,
Bergen et al. (2000) identified the deletion of a T at nucleotide 3798
of the ABCC gene in homozygosity. This mutation results in a frameshift
and premature chain termination.

.0008
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, 4-BP INS, 4243AGAA

In 2 families segregating what was thought to be autosomal dominant
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (177850), Bergen et al. (2000) identified a
4-bp insertion, AGAA, at nucleotide 4243 in exon 30. This insertion
causes a frameshift resulting in the disruption of the Walker B motif
and a protein longer by 24 amino acids.

.0009
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, 22-BP DEL

In a patient with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (177850), Bergen et al.
(2000) identified a 22-basepair deletion from nucleotides 1967 through
1989 of the ABCC6 gene in heterozygosity. The other allele appeared to
be wildtype.

.0010
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, DEL

In a patient with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (177850), Bergen et al.
(2000) detected a large deletion encompassing the ABCC6 gene as well as
the MYH11 (160745) and ABCC1 (158343) genes. The other allele appeared
to be wildtype.

.0011
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1268GLN

Ringpfeil et al. (2000) found an arg1268-to-gln (R1268Q) mutation in
compound heterozygous state in 3 presumably unrelated families with PXE
(264800). In 2 families, the mutation was combined with R1141X
(603234.0001); in 1 family, it was combined with R1138Q (603234.0003).

In one of the families with PXE in which the R1141X mutation had been
identified by Ringpfeil et al. (2000), Germain et al. (2000) identified
a 3803G-A transition in exon 27 of the ABCC6 cDNA, resulting in an
R1268Q mutation. To their surprise, the R1268Q variant was found in
homozygous state in the proband's unaffected husband. They investigated
the R1268Q mutation and found the Q1268 allele at a relatively high
frequency (0.19) in a control population of 62 Caucasians. Genotype
frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and 3 healthy volunteers
were homozygous for the Q1268 allele. R1268Q is thus a harmless
polymorphism when present in homozygous state.

.0012
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1138TRP

In a familial case of PXE (264800), Ringpfeil et al. (2000) found
homozygosity for an arg1138-to-trp (R1138W) mutation in the ABCC6 gene
due to a 3412C-T transition. The mutation was found in homozygous state
in the proband's mother and in heterozygous state in her father,
creating a pedigree pattern of pseudodominance. The same codon is
involved in the R1138Q mutation due to a 3413G-A transition
(603234.0003).

Ringpfeil et al. (2001) discussed the same pedigree, derived from a
consanguineous French-Canadian PXE family.

PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1164TER

Ringpfeil et al. (2001) studied the ABCC6 mutation in 4 multiplex
families with PXE (264800) inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
In each family, the proband was a compound heterozygote for a single-bp
substitution mutation (3490C-T; arg1164 to ter) and a novel deletion of
approximately 16.5 kb spanning the site of the single-bp substitution in
trans (i.e., on the homologous chromosome 16) (603234.0014). In 2 of the
families the single-nucleotide substitution was R1164X; in 1 it was
R1141X (603234.0001); and in another it was a splice site mutation,
3736-1G-A (603234.0015). In all 4 families the patients were thought
first to be homozygous for the nondeletion mutation. The deletion
mutation was shown to extend from intron 22 to intron 29, resulting in
out-of-frame deletion of 1,213 nucleotides from the corresponding mRNA
and causing elimination of 505 amino acids from the MRP6 polypeptide.
The deletion breakpoints were precisely the same in all 4 families,
which were of different ethnic backgrounds, and haplotype analysis by 13
microsatellite markers suggested that the deletion had occurred
independently. Deletion breakpoints within introns 22 and 29 were
embedded within AluSx repeat sequences, specifically in a 16-bp segment
of DNA, suggesting Alu-mediated homologous recombination as a mechanism.

ABCC6, EX23-29DEL

In a cohort of 101 unrelated patients with PXE (264800), Le Saux et al.
(2001) identified a 16.4-kb deletion of the ABCC6 gene (deletion of
exons 23-29) in 12.9% of mutant alleles. The frequency was very
different in Europe and the United States, being 4.3% and 28.4%,
respectively. The frequency of individuals homozygous for this mutation
was observed to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the United States.

PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1339CYS

In 17 Afrikaner families in South Africa with autosomal recessive
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (264800), Le Saux et al. (2002) found that 53%
of the PXE-associated alleles of the ABCC6 gene had a 4015C-T
transition, which caused an arg1339-to-cys (R1339C) mutation. Haplotype
analysis showed that the mutation was identical by descent in these
families.

.0018
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ARG1459CYS

In a family in which PXE classified as 'definite' occurred in 2
generations, Plomp et al. (2004) detected an arg1459-to-cys substitution
(R1459C) in the ABCC protein on 1 allele only. The authors considered
the diagnosis of PXE definite if 2 of the following 3 criteria were
present: yellowish papules and/or plaques on the lateral side of the
neck and/or flexural areas of the body; typical histopathological
changes in a skin biopsy after von Kossa staining; and the presence of
peau d'orange, angioid streaks, or comet-like streaks in the retina. The
mother of this family and one of her sons fulfilled all 3 criteria.
Plomp et al. (2004) stated that the R1459C mutation might be one that
could cause PXE in the heterozygous state (177850). In their review of
families with putative autosomal dominant PXE, including this family and
2 others examined by them, the authors noted that they did not find a
single family with definite PXE in 3 or more generations.

Bergen (2006) stated that the family with the apparently heterozygous
R1459C mutation studied by Plomp et al. (2004) remained 'an interesting
puzzle and is perhaps the always existing 'exception to the rule'.'

PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, VAL1298PHE

In a cohort of 122 unrelated patients with PXE (264800) from several
countries, Le Saux et al. (2001) found a 3892G-T transversion in exon 28
of the ABCC6 gene that resulted in a val1298-to-phe (V1298F)
substitution. The mutation was present in heterozygosity in 2 alleles
from patients from the United States, for an allele frequency among 74
United States alleles of 2.7%. The mutation was not found in the
European population.

Ilias et al. (2002) showed that the V1298F mutation, localized to the
C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of ABCC6, did not affect the expression of
the ABCC6 protein in infected insect cells, but that the protein was
essentially inactive in the MgATP-dependent transport of
N-ethylmaleimide S-glutathione (NEM-GS) or leukotriene-C4.

PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, GLY1302ARG

In a cohort of 122 unrelated patients with PXE (264800) from several
countries, Le Saux et al. (2001) found a 3904G-A transition in exon 28
of the ABCC6 gene that resulted in a gly1302-to-arg (G1302R) amino acid
substitution in the second intracellular nucleotide-binding domain. The
mutation, present in homozygosity, occurred in a total of 4 alleles from
patients from the United States, giving an allele frequency of 5.4% in a
total of 74 United States alleles. It was not found in the European
population.

Ilias et al. (2002) showed that the G1302R mutation did not affect the
expression of the ABCC6 protein in infected insect cells, but that the
protein was essentially inactive in the MgATP-dependent transport of
N-ethylmaleimide S-glutathione (NEM-GS) or leukotriene-C4.

ABCC6, GLY1321SER

In a cohort of 122 unrelated patients with PXE (264800) from several
countries, Le Saux et al. (2001) found a 3961G-A transition in exon 28
of the ABCC6 gene that resulted in a gly1321-to-ser (G1321S)
substitution in the second intracellular nucleotide-binding domain. They
found the mutation in heterozygosity in 1 of 74 United States alleles,
for an allele frequency of 1.4%. It was not found in the European
population.

Ilias et al. (2002) showed that the G1321S mutation did not affect the
expression of the ABCC6 protein in infected insect cells, but that the
protein was essentially inactive in the MgATP-dependent transport of
N-ethylmaleimide S-glutathione (NEM-GS) or leukotriene-C4.

PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, ASP1238HIS

Chassaing et al. (2004) described a pedigree of PXE (264800) with
pseudodominant inheritance. Two affected sibs carried 3 distinct
mutations of the ABCC6 gene. The brother carried a 3712G-C transversion
in exon 26 that resulted in an asp1238-to-his substitution (D1238H), and
a 3389C-T transition in exon 24 that resulted in a thr1130-to-met
substitution (T1130M; 603234.0024). His sister carried the T1130M
mutation and a 33-bp deletion (603234.0023). The mother, who had PXE
also, was deduced to a compound heterozygote for the deletion and
T1130M, whereas the father was assumed to be heterozygous for the D1238H
mutation which was shared by the sibs; however, DNA was not available
for study on either parent.

.0023
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, 33-BP DEL

In the Algerian pedigree studied by Chassaing et al. (2004), a female
patient with PXE (264800) carried a 33-bp deletion in exon 9 of the
ABCC6 gene (1088-1120del) in compound heterozygosity with a missense
mutation (603234.0024). The mutation led to the deletion of 11 amino
acids in the transmembrane and intracellular domains (Q363_R373del).

.0024
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
ABCC6, THR1130MET

See 603234.0022 and Chassaing et al. (2004). The T1130M substitution
arose from a 3389C-T transition in exon 24.

ARTERIAL CALCIFICATION, GENERALIZED, OF INFANCY, 2, INCLUDED
ABCC6, ARG765GLN

In a 28-year-old French man with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE; 264800),
who had a younger brother who died of generalized arterial calcification
of infancy (GACI2; 614473) at age 15 months, Le Boulanger et al. (2010)
identified compound heterozygosity for missense mutations in the ABCC6
gene, an arg765-to-gln (R765Q) substitution and a gln1406-to-lys
(Q1406K; 603234.0026) substitution. The mutations were found in
heterozygosity in each of his unaffected parents, respectively. Although
no DNA material was available from the deceased younger brother, his
disease was presumed to be related to the familial ABCC6 mutations. Le
Boulanger et al. (2010) concluded that GACI may represent an atypical
and severe end of the vascular phenotype spectrum of PXE. (The mutations
identified by Le Boulanger et al. (2010) were listed as R765Q and Q1406K
in their text, but as E765Q and E1406K in their Figure 3.)

The R765Q mutation in exon 18 of the ABCC6 gene has also been identified
in heterozygosity and in compound heterozygosity with another ABCC6
mutation in patients with PXE (see Le Saux et al., 2001 and Miksch et
al., 2005, respectively).

In a 3-year-old Spanish boy with generalized arterial calcification of
infancy (GACI2; 614473), who had calcification of the splenic and
pancreatic arteries, nephrocalcinosis, severe hypertension,
cardiomegaly, psychomotor retardation, and abdominal distention,
Nitschke et al. (2012) identified compound heterozygosity for 2
mutations in the ABCC6 gene: an R1141X substitution (603234.0001) and a
1552C-T transition in exon 12, resulting in an arg518-to-ter (R518X)
substitution.

The R518X mutation has also been identified in compound heterozygosity
with another ABCC6 mutation in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum
(PXE; 264800) (see, e.g., Meloni et al., 2001 and Miksch et al., 2005).

ABCC6, IVS21, G-T, +1

In a Canadian female infant with generalized arterial calcification of
infancy (GACI2; 614473), originally reported by Glatz et al. (2006), who
died at 6.5 weeks of age of myocardial infarction with calcification of
the aorta and coronary, pulmonary, and renal arteries and occlusion of
the right coronary artery, Nitschke et al. (2012) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 splice site mutations in the ABCC6 gene, a G-T
transversion in intron 21 (IVS21+1G-T) and a IVS26-1G-A (603234.0015),
both predicted to cause a frameshift resulting in a premature
termination codon. The latter mutation had previously been identified in
compound heterozygosity in a patient with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE;
264800).

The IVS21+1G-T splice-site mutation has also been identified in compound
heterozygosity with another ABCC6 mutation in PXE patients (see, e.g.,
Le Saux et al., 2001 and Miksch et al., 2005).

603647	TITLE *603647 BCS1, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG-LIKE; BCS1L
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

The human BCS1L gene encodes a homolog of S. cerevisiae bcs1 protein
involved in the assembly of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory
chain.

CLONING

The S. cerevisiae bcs1 protein is a constituent of the inner
mitochondrial membrane and is required for the expression of functional
ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (bc1) complex (see 191328). The bcs1
protein shares sequence similarity with members of the AAA (ATPases
associated with various cellular activities) superfamily (see 601681).
By searching an EST database for sequences related to bcs1, Petruzzella
et al. (1998) identified a cDNA encoding human BCS1L (BCS1-like). The
predicted 420-amino acid human protein is 50% identical to yeast bcs1
and, like bcs1, contains 2 conserved nucleotide-binding motifs. Although
BCS1L does not contain an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence,
in vitro mitochondrial import and trypsin-protection assays demonstrated
that it is imported into mitochondria. Northern blot analysis revealed
that BCS1L is expressed ubiquitously as a 1.4-kb mRNA. The authors also
detected a 4.5-kb transcript that they considered to be either an
alternative BCS1L mRNA or an mRNA derived from a related gene.

GENE FUNCTION

Found within the inner mitochondrial membrane, BCS1L is presumed to
facilitate insertion of Rieske Fe/S protein into precursors to complex
III during assembly of the respiratory chain (Cruciat et al., 1999).
Complex III then becomes assembled with complexes IV and I into a
respirasome supercomplex that facilitates the electron transfer required
for the synthesis of ATP.

MAPPING

Based on sequence similarity to ESTs, Petruzzella et al. (1998)
tentatively mapped the BCS1L gene to 2q33.

GENE STRUCTURE

De Lonlay et al. (2001) showed that the BCS1L gene consists of 7 exons.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Mitochondrial Complex III Deficiency, Nuclear Type 1

De Lonlay et al. (2001) found 4 biallelic mutations in the BCS1L gene in
6 patients from 4 families with mitochondrial complex III deficiency
nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1; 124000) characterized by neonatal proximal
tubulopathy, hepatic involvement, and encephalopathy. Complementation
studies in yeast confirmed the deleterious effect of these missense
mutations. De Lonlay et al. (2001) suggested that mutation of BCS1L is a
frequent cause of complex III deficiency, as one-third of their Turkish
patients had mutations in the BSC1L gene. De Lonlay et al. (2001)
reported that they had not been able to detect BCS1L mutations in
complex III-deficient patients with clinical presentations other than
neonatal tubulopathy with hepatic involvement and encephalopathy.

- GRACILE Syndrome

The GRACILE (growth retardation, amino aciduria, cholestasis, iron
overload, lactic acidosis, and early death) syndrome (603358) belongs to
the disease heritage of Finland. All affected families carry the same
ancestral haplotype on 2q33-q37, indicating 1 founder mutation (Visapaa
et al., 1998). Visapaa et al. (2002) identified a homozygous
ser78-to-gly mutation (S78G; 603358.0005) in the BCS1L gene in all
Finnish patients with GRACILE syndrome studied. In addition, they
identified 5 different mutations in the BCS1L gene in 3 British infants,
previously reported by Morris et al. (1995), whose symptoms resembled
those in GRACILE syndrome but who also had complex III deficiency and
neurologic symptoms. The phenotype of the Turkish patients in whom de
Lonlay et al. (2001) demonstrated mutations in the BCS1L gene was
distinctly different from that of the Finnish patients. Whereas the
Turkish patients had complex III deficiency, the Finnish patients had
complex III activity within the normal range. The Finnish patients had
no neurologic problems, but had marked hepatic iron overload, associated
with abnormal levels of proteins involved in iron transfer and storage,
and free plasma iron. These findings implied that BCS1L has another
cellular function that is uncharacterized but essential, and that it is
putatively involved in iron metabolism.

- Bjornstad Syndrome

Bjornstad syndrome (262000) is an autosomal recessive condition
characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and pili torti. Lubianca
Neto et al. (1998) mapped the Bjornstad syndrome locus to 2q34-q36.
Hinson et al. (2007) refined the map location of the disorder to 2q35
and demonstrated mutations in the BCS1L gene (e.g., 603647.0001).

GENOTYPE/PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

To understand how BCS2L mutations cause such widely different clinical
phenotypes, Hinson et al. (2007) considered the locations of defects on
the BCS1L protein structure and compared the function of mutant BCS1L in
yeast and in human lymphocytes. Their studies showed that all BCS1L
mutations disrupted the assembly of mitochondrial respirasomes (the
basic unit of respiration in human mitochondria), but the clinical
severity of the mutations was correlated with the production of reactive
oxygen species. The data indicated that in addition to mitochondrial
heteroplasmy and variable energy requirements of tissues,
tissue-specific sensitivities to reactive oxygen species contribute to
the variability of the manifestations of mitochondrial defects.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, SER277ASN

In 2 affected sibs and 1 fetus in a consanguineous family with
mitochondrial complex III deficiency nuclear type 1 (MC3DN1; 124000)
characterized by neonatal tubulopathy, encephalopathy, and liver
failure, de Lonlay et al. (2001) identified a homozygous 830G-A
transition in the BCS1L gene, resulting in a ser277-to-asp (S277N)
substitution.

.0002
LEIGH SYNDROME DUE TO MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY
BCS1L, PRO99LEU

In 2 patients with complex III deficiency (124000), a boy and a girl,
born to unrelated consanguineous families, de Lonlay et al. (2001)
identified the same homozygous C-to-T transition at nucleotide 296 in
exon 1 of the BCS1L gene, causing the substitution of a leucine for a
highly conserved proline at codon 99 (P99L). The patients had metabolic
acidosis, hepatic involvement, neurologic deterioration, and brainstem
and basal ganglia lesions consistent with a diagnosis of Leigh syndrome
(256000). One patient had abnormal ventilation patterns and proximal
renal tubulopathy.

.0003
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, ARG155PRO

In a boy of Turkish origin with complex III deficiency (124000) born to
nonconsanguineous parents, de Lonlay et al. (2001) identified compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the BCS1L gene: a 464C-G transversion
in exon 3 of the BCS1L gene, resulting in an arg155-to-pro (R155P)
substitution, and a 1057G-A transition in exon 7, resulting in a
val353-to-met (V353M; 603647.0004) substitution.

BCS1L, VAL353MET

See 603647.0003 and de Lonlay et al. (2001).

.0005
GRACILE SYNDROME
BCS1L, SER78GLY

Visapaa et al. (2002) reported that all GRACILE syndrome (603358)
patients in Finland were homozygous for a 232A-G mutation in exon 2 of
the BCS1L gene, resulting in a ser78-to-gly (S78G) substitution. Unlike
the Turkish patients reported by de Lonlay et al. (2001), the Finnish
patients had normal complex III activity and no neurologic problems, but
did have marked iron overload.

.0006
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, ARG45CYS

In 2 Spanish sibs with fatal infantile complex III deficiency (124000),
De Meirleir et al. (2003) identified compound heterozygosity for
mutation in the BCS1L gene: a 246C-T transition in exon 1, resulting in
an arg45-to-cys (R45C) substitution, and a 279C-T transition in exon 1,
resulting in an arg56-to-ter (R56X; 603647.0007) substitution. The R45C
substitution occurs in a crucial targeting signal of the gene and is
predicted to interfere with proper protein functioning. Each parent was
heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. Both patients had severe metabolic
acidosis noted shortly after birth, as well as severe liver dysfunction
and a renal tubulopathy. One died at age 3 weeks of lactic acidosis. The
second infant also had obvious neurologic involvement, with delayed
myelination, axial hypotonia, and developmental delay. He died at age 3
months. Postmortem liver examination of both infants showed liver
fibrosis, severe cholestasis, and hepatosiderosis with accumulation of
iron in aggregates of macrophages and in Kupffer cells. Mitochondria
appeared enlarged with few or no cristae and a fluffy matrix. De
Meirleir et al. (2003) suggested that the iron accumulation could be
explained by the lack of incorporation of iron in the iron-sulfur
cluster of complex III.

Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) reported another Spanish infant with the R45C
and R56X mutations. She presented with neonatal severe hypotonia, food
intolerance, and vomiting. She soon developed a proximal renal
tubulopathy with glucosuria, phosphaturia, and aminoaciduria, metabolic
lactic acidosis, and hepatic involvement. Bilateral cataracts were also
noted. At age 4 months, she showed nystagmus, hypertonia, microcephaly,
developmental delay, and failure to thrive. Her neurologic condition and
metabolic acidosis worsened rapidly, and she died at 6 months of age.
Biochemical studies of muscle tissue showed impaired activity of
mitochondrial complex III. Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) noted that this
child did not have evidence of altered iron metabolism, as had been
observed in the patients reported by De Meirleir et al. (2003), and as
has been observed in patients with the allelic disorder GRACILE syndrome
(603358). Ramos-Arroyo et al. (2009) postulated that phenotypic
variability even in individuals with the same BCS1L genotype may reflect
tissue-specific expression of the mutant gene.

BJORNSTAD SYNDROME
BCS1L, ARG183HIS

In affected members of the family with Bjornstad syndrome (262000) in
which Lubianca Neto et al. (1998) demonstrated linkage to 2q, Hinson et
al. (2007) identified homozygosity for a C-to-T transition in the BCS1L
gene, resulting in an arg183-to-his (R183H) substitution. Eight
individuals in 2 sibships related as first cousins once removed were
affected; the parents in each case were consanguineous.

.0009
BJORNSTAD SYNDROME WITH MILD MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY
MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1, INCLUDED
BCS1L, ARG184CYS

In a sporadic case of Bjornstad syndrome (262000) with mild
mitochondrial complex III deficiency (124000), Hinson et al. (2007)
found compound heterozygosity for 2 missense mutations in the BCS1L
gene: arg184 to cys (R184C) and gly35 to arg (G35R; 603647.0010).

In a Moroccan girl with mitochondrial complex III deficiency (124000),
Fernandez-Vizarra et al. (2007) identified compound heterozygosity for
the R184C mutation and a 547C-T transition in exon 3 of the BCS1L gene,
resulting in an arg183-to-cys (R183C; 603647.0012) substitution. She
presented at age 9 months with acute psychomotor regression, hypotonia,
and failure to thrive, which progressed to spastic quadriparesis and
mental retardation associated with abnormal signal intensities in the
thalami, basal ganglia, and periventricular white matter, consistent
with an encephalopathy. Heart, liver, and kidneys were apparently
unaffected, but she was also noted to have brittle hair. Studies in
yeast showed that both mutations significantly reduced mitochondrial
cytochrome content and respiratory activity, as well as caused a
decreased incorporation of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (UQCRFS1;
191327) into complex III. Further studies showed decreased levels of
fully assembled complex III. The findings suggested that BCS1L is
necessary for proper complex III assembly.

MITOCHONDRIAL COMPLEX III DEFICIENCY, NUCLEAR TYPE 1
BCS1L, THR50ALA

In a 4-year-old Spanish boy with isolated mitochondrial complex III
deficiency (124000), Blazquez et al. (2009) identified a homozygous
148A-G transition in exon 1 of the BCS1L gene, resulting in a
thr50-to-ala (T50A) substitution in the mitochondrial sorting sequence.
He presented at 6 months of age with psychomotor retardation, failure to
thrive, hypotonia, lactic acidosis, and hepatic dysfunction. Physical
examination showed unstable head support, poor eye fixation, coarse
facies, and epicanthus. There was hypertrichosis of the frontal head
zone and limbs, and excessive fat distribution in the upper back, neck,
hands and feet, with almost no fat on the limbs. Respiratory chain
activity in muscle and fibroblasts showed an isolated complex III defect
(58% of normal in muscle, 93% in fibroblasts). At age 4 years, he still
showed psychomotor retardation, had developed mild sensorineural hearing
loss, and persistent lactic acidemia, but renal function, hair, and iron
metabolism were normal. Brain MRI was normal. The mutation was not found
in 400 control alleles, and each unaffected parent was heterozygous for
the mutation.
