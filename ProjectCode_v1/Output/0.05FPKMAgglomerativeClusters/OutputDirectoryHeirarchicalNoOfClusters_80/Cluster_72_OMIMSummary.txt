BD73
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Dumas et al. (1994) used PCR with primers from conserved regions of
nuclear hormone receptor superfamily genes to identify a new member of
this superfamily, which they called BD73. The amino acid sequence of
BD73 is 96% identical to Rev-ErbA-alpha in the DNA-binding domain and
72% identical in the ligand-binding domain. Northern blot analysis
showed a 4.5-kb transcript present in variable amounts in a variety of
tissues and cell lines.

GENE FUNCTION

Dumas et al. (1994) showed that, in vitro, the BD73 protein has
DNA-binding activity to a specific A/T-rich sequence.

Toward a system-level understanding of the transcriptional circuitry
regulating circadian clocks, Ueda et al. (2005) identified
clock-controlled elements on 16 clock and clock-controlled genes in a
comprehensive surveillance of evolutionarily conserved cis elements and
measurement of the transcriptional dynamics. Ueda et al. (2005) found
that E boxes (CACGTG) and E-prime boxes (CACGTT) controlled the
expression of Per1 (602260), Nr1d2, Per2 (603426), Nr1d1 (602408), Dbp
(124097), Bhlhb2 (604256), and Bhlhb3 (606200) transcription following a
repressor-precedes-activator pattern, resulting in delayed
transcriptional activity. RevErbA/ROR (600825)-binding elements
regulated the transcriptional activity of Arntl (602550), Npas2
(603347), Nfil3 (605327), Clock (601851), Cry1 (601933), and Rorc
(602943) through a repressor-precedes-activator pattern as well.
DBP/E4BP4-binding elements controlled the expression of Per1, Per2, Per3
(603427), Nr1d1, Nr1d2, Rora, and Rorb (601972) through a
repressor-antiphasic-to-activator mechanism, which generates
high-amplitude transcriptional activity. Ueda et al. (2005) suggested
that regulation of E/E-prime boxes is a topologic vulnerability in
mammalian circadian clocks, a concept that had been functionally
verified using in vitro phenotype assay systems.

Solt et al. (2012) identified potent synthetic REV-ERB agonists with in
vivo activity. Administration of synthetic REV-ERB ligands alters
circadian behavior and the circadian pattern of core clock gene
expression in the hypothalami of mice. The circadian pattern of
expression of an array of metabolic genes in the liver, skeletal muscle,
and adipose tissue was also altered, resulting in increased energy
expenditure. Treatment of diet-induced obese mice with a REV-ERB agonist
decreased obesity by reducing fat mass and markedly improving
dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia.

Cho et al. (2012) determined the genomewide cis-acting targets of both
REV-ERB isoforms in murine liver, which revealed shared recognition at
over 50% of their total DNA binding sites and extensive overlap with the
master circadian regulator BMAL1. Although REV-ERB-alpha has been shown
to regulate BMAL1 expression directly, cistromic analysis revealed a
more profound connection between BMAL1 and the REV-ERB-alpha and
REV-ERB-beta genomic regulatory circuits than was previously suspected.
Genes within the intersection of the BMAL1, REV-ERB-alpha, and
REV-ERB-beta cistromes are highly enriched for both clock and metabolic
functions. As predicted by the cistromic analysis, dual depletion of
REV-ERB-alpha and REV-ERB-beta function by creating double-knockout mice
profoundly disrupted circadian expression of core circadian clock and
lipid homeostatic gene networks. As a result, double-knockout mice
showed markedly altered circadian wheel-running behavior and deregulated
lipid metabolism. Cho et al. (2012) concluded that their data united
REV-ERB-alpha and REV-ERB-beta with PER, CRY, and other components of
the principal feedback loop that drives circadian expression and
indicated a more integral mechanism for the coordination of circadian
rhythm and metabolism.

Lam et al. (2013) presented evidence that in mouse macrophages Rev-Erbs
regulate target gene expression by inhibiting the functions of distal
enhancers that are selected by macrophage lineage-determining factors,
thereby establishing a macrophage-specific program of repression. The
repressive functions of Rev-Erbs are associated with their ability to
inhibit the transcription of enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs). Furthermore,
targeted degradation of eRNAs at 2 enhancers subject to negative
regulation by Rev-Erbs resulted in reduced expression of nearby mRNAs,
suggesting a direct role of these eRNAs in enhancer function. By
precisely defining eRNA start sites using a modified form of global
run-on sequencing that quantifies nascent 5-prime ends, Lam et al.
(2013) showed that transfer of full enhancer activity to a target
promoter requires both the sequences mediating transcription factor
binding and the specific sequences encoding the eRNA transcript. Lam et
al. (2013) concluded that their studies provided evidence for a direct
role of eRNAs in contributing to enhancer function and suggested that
Rev-Erbs act to suppress gene expression at a distance by repressing
eRNA transcription.

MAPPING

Using YAC mapping and FISH, Koh and Moore (1999) mapped the NR1D2 gene
to chromosome 3p24.3-p24.2.

EVOLUTION

Koh and Moore (1999) noted that the THRA (190120), NR1D1 (602408), and
RARA (180240) genes are linked on chromosome 17q, and that the NR1D1
gene overlaps an exon of the THRA gene on the opposite strand. They
found that THRB (190160), NR1D2, and RARB (180220) are similarly linked
and oriented on chromosome 3p. The ancestral genes were duplicated
before the divergence of vertebrates, since at least the TRs and RARs
are also duplicated in birds and amphibians.

;;CYTOCHROME P450, SUBFAMILY XXVIA, POLYPEPTIDE 2; CYP26A2;;
P450, RETINOIC ACID-INACTIVATING, 2; P450RAI2
DESCRIPTION 
CLONING

Retinoids, particularly all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), are important
regulators of cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.
All-trans-RA plays a role during development and in the maintenance of
adult tissues. The level of all-trans-RA in cells and tissues is
regulated by the balance between its biosynthesis and its catabolism to
inactive metabolites. The cytochrome P450 enzyme P450RAI (CYP26A1;
602239), referred to by White et al. (2000) as P450RAI1, is partially
responsible for the inactivation of all-trans-RA. White et al. (2000)
identified an EST clone from a human retina cDNA library that showed
significant sequence homology to P450RAI1. Using PCR primers, they
amplified a partial cDNA, designated P450RAI2 (CYP26A2), encoding a
512-amino acid protein that is also involved in the specific
inactivation of all-trans-RA. Northern blot analysis detected a 5-kb
P450RAI2 transcript in most tissues tested, with highest expression in
human adult brain, particularly in the cerebellum and pons but also in
the cerebral cortex, medulla, occipital pole, frontal lobe, and temporal
lobe. P450RAI1, on the other hand, did not show appreciable expression
in any of the human brain tissues tested.

GENE FUNCTION

White et al. (2000) found that transiently transfected P450RAI2 was
capable of converting all-trans-RA to more polar metabolites.
Competition experiments with other retinoids suggested that all-trans-RA
is the preferred substrate.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 3 sibs and an unrelated Turkish patient with radiohumeral fusions and
other skeletal and craniofacial anomalies (614416), Laue et al. (2011)
identified homozygous missense mutations in the CYP26B1 gene (R363L,
605207.0001, and S146P, 605207.0002, respectively).

ANIMAL MODEL

Yashiro et al. (2004) found that mice express Cyp26b1 in the distal
region of the developing limb bud. Mice that lacked Cyp26b1 exhibited
severe limb malformations. The lack of Cyp26b1 resulted in spreading of
the RA signal toward the distal end of the developing limb and induced
proximodistal patterning defects characterized by expansion of proximal
identity and restriction of distal identity. Cyp26b1 deficiency also
induced pronounced apoptosis in the developing limb and delayed
chondrocyte maturation. Wildtype embryos exposed to excess RA
phenocopied the limb defects of Cyp26b1-deficient mice. Yashiro et al.
(2004) concluded that RA acts as a morphogen to determine proximodistal
identity and that CYP26B1 prevents apoptosis and promotes chondrocyte
maturation in the developing limb.

Bowles et al. (2006) found that retinoic acid, produced by mesonephroi
of both sexes, caused germ cells in the ovary to enter meiosis and
initiate oogenesis. Meiosis is retarded in the fetal testis by the
action of the retinoid-degrading enzyme CYP26B1, ultimately leading to
spermatogenesis. In testes of Cyp26b1-knockout mouse embryos, germ cells
entered meiosis precociously, as if in a normal ovary. Thus, Bowles et
al. (2006) concluded that precise regulation of retinoid levels during
fetal gonad development provides the molecular control mechanism that
specifies germ cell fate.

Laue et al. (2011) analyzed murine embryos exposed to a chemical
inhibitor of Cyp26 enzymes and zebrafish lines with mutations in cyp26b1
and suggested that the endochondral bone fusions are due to unrestricted
chondrogenesis at the presumptive sites of joint formation within
cartilaginous templates, whereas craniosynostosis is induced by a defect
in osteoblastic differentiation. Ultrastructural analysis, in situ
expression studies, and in vitro quantitative RT-PCR experiments of
cellular markers of osseous differentiation indicated that the most
likely cause for these phenomena is aberrant osteoblast-osteocyte
transitioning.

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
RADIOHUMERAL FUSIONS WITH OTHER SKELETAL AND CRANIOFACIAL ANOMALIES
CYP26B1, ARG363LEU

In 3 sibs, born to first-cousin parents, who exhibited combinations of
severe craniofacial malformation, occipital encephalocele, radiohumeral
fusions, oligodactyly, advanced osseous maturation, and calvarial
mineralization defects (614416), Laue et al. (2011) identified
homozygosity for a 1088G-T transversion in the CYP26B1 gene, predicting
an arg363-to-leu (R363L) substitution. Both parents were heterozygous
for the mutation, which was not found in 190 unrelated control
individuals. The mutation occurs within an EXXR motif that is highly
conserved across species and all human CYP450 proteins. Substitutions of
residues within this motif are known to ablate the catalytic properties
of these enzymes. Cellular cotransfection of CYP26B1-expression
constructs encoding the R363L substitution alongside an RA-responsive
luciferase reporter gene demonstrated a significantly attenuated ability
to metabolize exogenously applied RA in HEK293 cells (86% reduction).
The reduction of enzymatic activity noted for the mutant protein was
comparable to that conferred by a truncating mutation underlying a
zebrafish cyp26b1 null allele, indicating that the human mutation
constitutes a null allele.

.0002
RADIOHUMERAL FUSIONS WITH OTHER SKELETAL AND CRANIOFACIAL ANOMALIES
CYP26B1, SER146PRO

In a Turkish patient, born to consanguineous parents, with coronal and
lambdoid craniosynostosis, a large sagittal skull defect, limited elbow
extension, and arachnodactyly (614416), Laue et al. (2011) identified a
homozygous 436T-C transition in the CYP26B1 gene, predicting a
ser146-to-pro (S146P) substitution. Th3 mutation is predicted to disrupt
helix C, a broadly represented structural element in CYP450 enzymes.
Cellular cotransfection of CYP26B1-expression constructs encoding the
S146P substitution alongside an RA-responsive luciferase reporter gene
demonstrated a significantly attenuated ability to metabolize
exogenously applied RA in HEK293 cells (31% reduction). The retention of
activity by the S146P substitution was consistent with it constituting a
hypomorphic mutation.

608753	TITLE *608753 tRNA SPLICING ENDONUCLEASE 2, S. CEREVISIAE, HOMOLOG OF; TSEN2
;;SEN2, YEAST, HOMOLOG OF; SEN2
DESCRIPTION 
DESCRIPTION

tRNA splicing is a fundamental process required for cell growth and
division. SEN2 is a subunit of the tRNA splicing endonuclease, which
catalyzes the removal of introns, the first step in tRNA splicing
(Paushkin et al., 2004).

CLONING

By searching sequence databases using yeast Sen2 as probe, followed by
PCR of human cDNA libraries, Paushkin et al. (2004) isolated a
full-length SEN2 cDNA and a splice variant lacking exon 8. Full-length
SEN2 contains 465 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 51
kD. It shares a high degree of similarity with yeast Sen2 only in the
active site domain. The SEN2 variant lacking exon 8 contains 448 amino
acids. Northern blot analysis detected low expression of both SEN2
transcripts in all tissues examined. Immunofluorescence microscopy of
transfected HeLa cells localized both SEN2 isoforms to the nucleus. The
variant lacking exon 8 was frequently found in nucleoli in dot-like
structures.

GENE FUNCTION

Paushkin et al. (2004) identified and characterized the human tRNA
splicing endonuclease. This enzyme consists of SEN2, SEN34 (608754),
SEN15 (608756), and SEN54 (608755), homologs of the yeast tRNA
endonuclease subunits. Additionally, the SEN2 variant lacking exon 8 is
part of a complex with unique RNA endonuclease activity. Paushkin et al.
(2004) found that both human endonuclease complexes are associated with
pre-mRNA 3-prime end processing factors, including CLP1 (608757). Small
interfering RNA-mediated depletion of SEN2 led to defects in maturation
of both pre-tRNA and pre-mRNA. These findings demonstrated a link
between pre-tRNA splicing and pre-mRNA 3-prime end formation, suggesting
that the endonuclease subunits function in multiple RNA processing
events.

MAPPING

The International Radiation Hybrid Mapping Consortium mapped the TSEN2
gene to chromosome 3 (TMAP RH103927).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Budde et al. (2008) identified a homozygous missense mutation in a
patient of consanguineous Pakistani descent, resulting in
pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (277470).

ALLELIC VARIANT .0001
PONTOCEREBELLAR HYPOPLASIA, TYPE 2B
TSEN2, TYR309CYS

In a Pakistani male, the product of a consanguineous union, with
pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (PCH2B; 612389) in whom no mutations
in TSEN54 (608755) were identified, Budde et al. (2008) identified a
homozygous A-to-G transition at nucleotide 926 of the TSEN2 gene,
resulting in a tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 309 (Y309C).
Each parent was heterozygous for the mutation, which was not identified
in 188 healthy Pakistani controls nor in 92 Dutch, 45 Chinese, or 28
Palestinian controls. The tyrosine at position 309 is strictly conserved
(tyrosine or phenylalanine) within eukaryotic organisms.
